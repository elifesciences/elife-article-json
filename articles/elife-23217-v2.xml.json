Here we investigate the contribution of the rhoptry protein RhopH2, in the formation of new permeability pathways (NPPs) in <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected erythrocytes. We show RhopH2 interacts with RhopH1, RhopH3, the erythrocyte cytoskeleton and exported proteins involved in host cell remodeling. Knockdown of RhopH2 expression in cycle one leads to a depletion of essential vitamins and cofactors and decreased de novo synthesis of pyrimidines in cycle two. There is also a significant impact on parasite growth, replication and transition into cycle three. The uptake of solutes that use NPPs to enter erythrocytes is also reduced upon RhopH2 knockdown. These findings provide direct genetic support for the contribution of the RhopH complex in NPP activity and highlight the importance of NPPs to parasite survival."

Here we investigate the contribution of the rhoptry protein RhopH2, in the formation of new permeability pathways (NPPs) in <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected erythrocytes. We show RhopH2 interacts with RhopH1, RhopH3, the erythrocyte cytoskeleton and exported proteins involved in host cell remodeling. Knockdown of RhopH2 expression in cycle one leads to a depletion of essential vitamins and cofactors and decreased de novo synthesis of pyrimidines in cycle two. There is also a significant impact on parasite growth, replication and transition into cycle three. The uptake of solutes that use NPPs to enter erythrocytes is also reduced upon RhopH2 knockdown. These findings provide direct genetic support for the contribution of the RhopH complex in NPP activity and highlight the importance of NPPs to parasite survival."

Critical for the proliferation and survival of <i>Plasmodium</i> in the blood is their ability to quickly penetrate host erythrocytes and acquire nutrients required for rapid growth. To facilitate this, the invasive merozoite forms of <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. sequentially secrete proteins from their apical organelles, the micronemes, rhoptries and dense granules. Proteins localizing to the micronemes and rhoptry neck are implicated in the irreversible attachment of the parasite to the host cell and are critical for invasion (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib24\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Weiss et al., 2016</a>]). Dense granule proteins are secreted once <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites have invaded their host cell (<a href=\"#bib54\">Riglar et al., 2011</a>), contributing to remodeling of the host cell (<a href=\"#bib14\">de Koning-Ward et al., 2016</a>). However, the role of proteins that localize to the rhoptry bulb is less clear and although they have been implicated in roles ranging from rhoptry biogenesis, erythrocyte invasion, formation of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in which the parasite is encased, as well as modification of the host cell (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kats et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Counihan et al., 2013</a>), functional data supporting these roles is very limited."

It is found in a high molecular weight complex with RhopH1 and RhopH3 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cooper et al., 1988</a>) that is discharged from merozoites, associating with the erythrocyte surface upon merozoite contact (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sam-Yellowe et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sam-Yellowe and Perkins, 1991</a>). The localization of RhopH proteins in the newly-infected erythrocyte is less clear as multiple localizations, including the PV membrane (PVM), Maurer\u2019s clefts and the cytosolic face of the erythrocyte membrane have been described for its constituents using different experimental approaches (<a href=\"#bib49\">Perkins and Ziefer, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ndengele et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sam-Yellowe et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hiller et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vincensini et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2008</a>).

Via a high throughput drug-screening approach Clag3 has been linked to plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC) activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nguitragool et al., 2011</a>). PSAC is a type of new permeability pathway (NPP) induced in the erythrocyte membrane by <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. that increases the cell\u2019s porosity to organic and inorganic solutes. <i>P. falciparum</i> Clag3 null-mutants exhibit delayed in vitro growth, although NPP activity has not been investigated (<a href=\"#bib7\">Comeaux et al., 2011</a>). Intriguingly, Clag3 exhibits no homology to known ion channel proteins and lacks conventional membrane spanning regions to form a pore through the erythrocyte membrane, although it exists as both an integral and peripheral membrane protein in the infected erythrocyte (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nguitragool et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zainabadi, 2016</a>). Thus whether Clag3 forms ion channels directly and exclusively or if other parasite proteins or host cell membrane components contribute to a functional NPP is unknown. Alternatively, Clag3 may participate indirectly, for example, by regulating NPP activity."

As RhopH1 is encoded by a multi-gene family, it is difficult to establish without genetically disrupting all but one <i>clag</i> variant within a parasite, whether the <i>clag</i> genes serve complementary functions or play distinct roles, including in NPP activity. To address these questions, we characterized RhopH2 in <i>P. falciparum</i> and conditionally depleted its expression in <i>P. falciparum</i> and the rodent malaria parasite <i>P. berghei</i> to investigate its contribution to erythrocyte invasion, parasite growth and erythrocyte permeability. Depletion of RhopH2 in cycle one did not affect transition into cycle two, suggesting RhopH2 plays no direct role in invasion. However, NPP activity was greatly reduced and parasite growth slowed as parasites progressed into trophozoite stage in cycle two, possibly due to nutrient depravation and/or accumulation of waste products. Transition into cycle three was curtailed by interesting phenomena including reduced schizont rupture and merozoite malformation that may be linked to reduced de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Taken together, RhopH2 appears to be important for NPP activity and for the exchange of nutrients and wastes with the blood plasma to facilitate parasite growth and proliferation."

This was further validated by western blotting of parasite lysates from clonal PfRhopH2-HAglmS parasites using an anti-HA antibody; RhopH2 typically runs at 140 kDa by SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cooper et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ling et al., 2003</a>) and the observed 150 kDa band of RhopH2-HA is consistent with its anticipated size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>).

The hydrophobic region at I739-H759 is not universally predicted as a conventional transmembrane domain bioinformatically (eg. TMHMM, SOSUI, TMPred). Therefore, we examined the solubility profile of RhopH2 at both schizont and ring-stages. We found that in contrast to EXP2, which is a component of the <i>Plasmodium</i> translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) that resides at the PVM and requires Triton X-100 to be extracted from the membranes (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Koning-Ward et al., 2009</a>), the majority of RhopH2 could already be extracted with carbonate when sequential solubility assays were conducted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>, top panel). This indicates that RhopH2 is peripherally associated with membranes and is not an integral membrane protein. However, when erythrocytes infected with ring-stage parasites were saponin-lysed, pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended directly (rather than sequentially) in various detergents/buffers, RhopH2 could be extracted with carbonate and mostly with urea (which also extracts peripheral membrane proteins), whereas it remained in the Triton X-100 pellet fraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>, bottom panel). Combined, this data indicates that while RhopH2 predominantly has a peripheral association with the membranes at its respective locations, RhopH2 may be interacting with erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins or is present in lipid rafts during the ring-stages, leading to its insolubility in Triton X-100 when resuspended in this buffer directly."

That RhopH2 was interacting with the other members of the RhopH complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>) is consistent with an earlier report demonstrating the RhopH complex persists intact for at least 18 hr post-invasion (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lustigman et al., 1988</a>). There were more peptides recovered for RhopH1 (particularly Clags3.1, 3.2 and 9) and RhopH3 than there were for RhopH2 at the ring and trophozoite stages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Given that predicted molecular weights for the Clags (160\u2013171 kDa) and RhopH2 (163 kDa) are similar but that of RhopH3 is somewhat smaller (104 kDa), this indicates that each component of the RhopH complex may not be in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. Blue-Native PAGE gel analysis revealed that RhopH2 is present in a\u00a0~670 kDa complex that has a molecular mass larger than the predicted\u00a0~425 kDa (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>).

Peptides from exported proteins were more abundant in the pull-down performed on lysates from trophozoites compared to ring-stages, in keeping with protein export peaking during the trophozoite stage. The exception was ring erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) in which more peptides were observed in the ring-stage pull-down. RESA is one of the first proteins exported into the erythrocyte that ultimately localizes to the ankyrin-band 3 complex at the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. A large number of peptides to erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins were also identified, including tubulin, spectrin, ankyrin, protein 4.1, band 3 and actin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). Whether RhopH2 is indirectly interacting with these cytoskeletal components via exported proteins, or specifically interacting with all or a subset of these cytoskeletal proteins is unknown, especially since many cytoskeletal elements are bound together in the cell. Taken together, these results indicate that after invasion, the RhopH complex traffics from the PVM to the erythrocyte membrane and either en route or when it reaches its final destination, RhopH2 interacts with a number of exported parasite proteins that also bind to components of the host cytoskeleton."

Erythrocytes infected with synchronized ring-stage parasites were treated for up to two cycles with 2.5 mM GlcN and assessed for protein knockdown via western blot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) and parasite growth via Giemsa-stained smears relative to parasites grown in the absence of GlcN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b\u2013c</a>). RhopH2 is normally transcribed around the onset of schizogony (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ling et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bozdech et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Le Roch et al., 2004</a>) and the addition of 2.5 mM GlcN resulted in knockdown of RhopH2 expression in schizonts by 84% within the first cycle. By late in the second cycle, RhopH2 protein levels were reduced by 92% in those parasites that made it to schizont stage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). RhopH2-HAglmS parasites (+GlcN) appeared morphologically normal by the end of the first cycle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). In separate experiments whereby RhopH2-HAglmS parasites expressing GFP at the end of cycle one were incubated with donor erythrocytes, the conversion of schizonts to ring stage parasites and therefore invasion efficiency was not specifically affected by the knockdown of RhopH2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). In contrast, a striking growth defect in RhopH2-HAglmS (+GlcN) parasites was observed in the second cell cycle around the ring to trophozoite transition stage, with late-ring stage parasites appearing irregular in shape and trophozoites exhibiting an abnormal stunted phenotype rather than progressing to mature trophozoites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). In addition, RhopH2-HAglmS (+GlcN) parasites that transitioned to schizonts at the end of the second cycle harboured significantly lower numbers of merozoites per schizont (mean of 19 merozoites cf 12 merozoites for \u2013GlcN and +GlcN cultures, respectively p&lt;0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>).

This all translated to\u00a0~4 fold reduction in the number of ring-stage parasites observed at the beginning of the third cycle when compared to parasites not exposed to GlcN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>)."

No obvious differences were observed in general schizont morphology or in the ability of the erythrocyte to burst, indicating egress <i>per se</i> was not actually affected. Rather, instead of the merozoites dispersing rapidly after egress, GlcN treatment caused the merozoites to remain clumped together (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media2\">2</a>), a phenotype not observed in 3D7 (+GlcN) parasites (not shown). Occasionally remnants of membranes could be observed around the merozoites, but even when these broke down, the merozoites remained clumped (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, see 3 mM 5s versus 29.1s). Nine and eleven schizont ruptures were observed \u00b1 GlcN treatment respectively, and as a consequence of merozoite clumping following GlcN treatment, less than two merozoites per rupture were released and able to contact new erythrocytes compared with six merozoites without GlcN (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). The net effect was fewer average invasions per rupture, with only 0.25 after GlcN treatment compared to 2.6 without treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). Whilst 28 out of the 63 merozoites that made erythrocyte contact without GlcN went on to invade erythrocytes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), only two out of the 14 merozoites treated with GlcN invaded erythrocytes, indicating a success rate of 0.44 and 0.14 invasions per contact, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). From these results, it was inferred that the lower fold-increase in parasitemia from cycle two to the next after RhopH2 knockdown stemmed from a combined effect of reduction in the number of parasites reaching schizogony in cycle two and a reduced invasion rate. The latter most likely stems from an indirect effect of RhopH2 knockdown that results in a clumping of merozoites incapable of breaking free to invade a new host cell and a reduced competency of merozoites forming at the end of cycle two to successfully invade an erythrocyte."

This also provided insight into the consequences of depleting RhopH2 expression on parasite growth in vivo. In this case, the <i>P. berghei rhoph2</i> locus was modified to insert an anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-regulated transactivator element (TRAD) downstream of the endogenous <i>rhoph2</i> promoter and a minimal promoter with TRAD binding sites upstream of the <i>rhoph2</i> coding sequence. <i>P. berghei</i> ANKA parasites transfected with linearized pTRAD4-RhopH2ss and surviving pyrimethamine drug pressure were analyzed by diagnostic PCR and Southern blot, confirming that the targeting construct had integrated correctly into the <i>rhoph2</i> locus and the line was clonal (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c</a>). Transcription of <i>rhoph2</i> in this line, termed PbRhopH2-iKD, was highly responsive to ATc, with\u00a0~11-fold reduction of <i>rhoph2</i> mRNA in schizont stages as determined by qRT-PCR and RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>)."

Conversely, growth of parental <i>P. berghei</i> parasites was unaffected by the presence of ATc (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>) as has been shown previously (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pino et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Elsworth et al., 2014</a>). The slower growth of PbRhopH2-iKD exposed to sucrose compared to parental <i>P. berghei</i> parasites exposed to ATc is most likely due to the transactivator not being able to induce transcription of <i>rhopH2</i> to the same level as the native promoter."

Sorbitol transport into infected erythrocytes requires NPP activity, resulting in hypotonicity-induced cell lysis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wagner et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nguitragool et al., 2011</a>). Thus RhopH2-HAglmS-parasitized erythrocytes transfected with the Hyp1-Nluc reporter were treated with sorbitol buffer containing NanoGlo. The degree of lysis and hence channel activity could be quantified by measuring the amount of NanoGlo hydrolysed by Hyp1-Nluc which is released during cell lysis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Azevedo et al., 2014</a>). We established that GlcN-mediated knockdown of RhopH2 dramatically reduced the capacity of infected erythrocytes to be lysed by sorbitol, suggesting RhopH2 contributes to NPP activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>). In contrast, 3D7-parasitized erythrocytes treated with GlcN were not affected in their ability to be lysed by sorbitol indicating that depletion of RhopH2 and not treatment with GlcN was responsible for inhibition of NPP function (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>). As the ability of parasitized erythrocytes to be lysed only commences\u00a0&gt;24 hpi, Giemsa smears of parasites used in the sorbitol assays were examined but this revealed the parasites were all similarly aged (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>). When an iso-osmotic solution of alanine was used instead of sorbitol, similar results were obtained, with increasing concentrations of GlcN reducing the capacity of RhopH2-HAglmS parasitized erythrocytes to be lysed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). More lysis inhibition was also observed in 32 hr trophozoites compared to 24 hr trophozoites, consistent with the NPPs being more developed in older parasites."

This was undertaken by conducting comparative untargeted metabolomics on 3D7 and RhopH2-HAglmS parasites incubated in the presence and absence of 2.5 mM GlcN. Overall,\u00a0~1000 metabolites from diverse pathways were detected and assigned putative identities based on accurate mass, and confirmed using retention time where standards were available (<a href=\"#bib13\">Creek et al., 2012</a>). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of all metabolite features across the four sample groups, 3D7 \u00b1GlcN) and RhopH2-HAglmS (\u00b1GlcN) showed that replicates from groups 3D7 (\u00b1GlcN) and RhopH2-HAglmS (-GlcN) clustered together, and that these were metabolically different to the induced RhopH2 knockdown, RhopH2-HAglmS (+GlcN) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>). This indicates that knockdown of RhopH2 causes a reproducible metabolic shift in the parasites. The heat map demonstrates a substantial impact of GlcN on global metabolite levels, even in wild-type 3D7 parasites (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b</a>). Nevertheless, as indicated in the PCA analysis, the inclusion of the 3D7 (+GlcN) control allowed detection of several metabolites that were specifically perturbed in response to RhopH2 knockdown, including selected vitamins/cofactors, nucleotides, amino acids and glycolytic metabolites (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b</a>). A detailed scrutiny of individual metabolites showed that while glucosamine treatment appeared to elevate metabolite levels in general, the RhopH2 knockdown resulted in decreased levels of folate and thiamin phosphates, which are essential vitamins and cofactors for cellular growth (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9c</a>). The other class of metabolites to significantly decrease upon RhopH2 depletion were intermediates in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, N-carbamoyl L-aspartate, dihydroorotate and orotate. These metabolites are essential nucleotide precursors in <i>P. falciparum</i>, however, levels of downstream nucleotides were not affected at this time-point (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Few other metabolites were significantly and specifically depleted in the RhopH2 knockdown, with the exception of the glycolytic intermediates 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The only putatively identified metabolite to extensively accumulate (&gt;5-fold higher than all controls) in the RhopH2 knockdown was the urea cycle intermediate argininosuccinate, however, the other urea cycle intermediates were not significantly perturbed. Interestingly, a general increase in amino acid levels was also observed in the RhopH2 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9d</a>)."

We originally hypothesized that the RhopH complex localizes to the host cytosolic side of the PVM immediately after invasion to act in concert with PTEX to translocate the proteins that are exported very early across the PVM. Hence, secretion of the RhopH complex via the rhoptries may provide a more timely mechanism for the complex to localize to the cytosolic face of the PVM rather than traversing through PTEX and would also allow the complex to remain intact. However, knocking down RhopH2 did not affect the export of RESA, SBP1, PfEMP1 or the Hyp1-Nluc reporter protein, while the export of these native proteins is blocked by knocking down PTEX function (<a href=\"#bib18\">Elsworth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beck et al., 2014</a>).

Interestingly, other proteins known to interact with the erythrocyte cytoskeleton, including RESA, MESA, and PHIST proteins also affinity purified with RhopH2. The PHIST proteins LyMP (Pf3D7_0532400) and PF3D7_0936800 have recently been shown to interact with the acidic terminal sequence of PfEMP1 to connect this major virulence factor to the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib47\">Oberli et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Proellocks et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Oberli et al., 2016</a>).

The growth of the parasites was affected, particularly when they transitioned to the trophozoite stage, which resulted in a longer cell cycle for those that remained viable and hence delayed egress. By the end of the second cycle, schizonts formed fewer merozoites and those that did form appeared clumped and tethered to one another as though cytokinesis had not kept pace with the egress developmental program that triggers breakdown of the PVM and erythrocyte membranes. The failure to maintain a synchronized developmental program could be indicative of stress, perhaps due to a decrease in access to nutrients. It is, therefore, feasible that knocking down RhopH2 affected hypotonic-induced cell lysis by sorbitol, which requires NPP activity."

                        "text": "The reduction in the levels of folate in the RhopH2 knockdown was also striking and implicates RhopH2 in nutrient uptake. Although <i>P. falciparum</i> is capable of folate synthesis, it also needs to import exogenous folate (<a href=\"#bib34\">Krungkrai et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 1999</a>), and encodes for two folate transporters FT1 (PF3D7_0828600) and FT2 (PF3D7_1116500), which localize to the plasma membrane. RhopH2 and FT1 have very similar expression profiles (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aurrecoechea et al., 2009</a>), with maximal expression observed in the late trophozoite and schizont stage. It is conceivable that RhopH2 and FT1 act in concert to facilitate the transport of folate across the erythrocyte membrane, and parasite plasma membrane, respectively. A similar decrease in folate levels observed in furosemide-treated parasites provides support for implication of RhopH2 in NPP mediated nutrient uptake. A decrease in levels of other essential vitamins and cofactors also supports the role of RhopH2 in nutrient uptake. We also saw a decrease in intermediates of pyrimidine biosynthesis in the RhopH2 knockdown, although the levels of pyrimidine precursors (aspartate and glutamine) and end products (pyrimidine nucleotides) were unchanged, indicating that pre-existing nucleotide pools are not exhausted at the stage analyzed (mid-trophozoites in the second cycle post GlcN treatment). In contrast, we saw an increase in the levels of N-carbamoyl aspartate in furosemide-treated parasites, and it was not expected that levels of this intermediate of de novo pyrimidine synthesis would directly depend on NPPs. Interestingly, other NPP inhibitors have been shown to also inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dickerman et al., 2016</a>), an essential enzyme in this pathway that would modulate N-carbamoyl aspartate concentration, and it is likely that the furosemide treatment (at a concentration of 500 \u00b5M for\u00a0~24 hr) also has secondary effects on metabolism that differ from the RhopH2 knockdown. Nevertheless, the specific metabolic profile observed in both the RhopH2 knockdown and furosemide-treated parasites (i.e decreased folate and phosphoenolpyruvate, increased threonine, histidine, asparagine, serine and argininosuccinate) supports a common impact on parasite biochemistry. This metabolic profile was not observed following treatment with 100 other antimalarial compounds using the same metabolomics methodology (<a href=\"#bib11\">Creek et al., 2016</a>), suggesting this profile is specific for NPP inhibition and it is consistent with the increased threonine and histidine levels reported for other NPP inhibitors (where folate, phosphoenolpyruvate, serine and argininosuccinate were not assayed) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dickerman et al., 2016</a>)."

This phenotype has been reported earlier in metabolically compromised <i>P. berghei</i> parasites with a disrupted pyrimidine synthesis pathway (<a href=\"#bib59\">Srivastava et al., 2015</a>). The mechanism responsible for the observed down-regulation of pyrimidine synthesis and glycolysis is not clear, but may be secondary to a starvation response or compromised viability. Metabolites in these two pathways are particularly susceptible to depletion in parasites exposed to a range of antimalarial compounds (<a href=\"#bib11\">Creek et al., 2016</a>). The observed increase in amino acids in the RhopH2 knockdown could be due to a reduced efflux of excess amino acids produced by haemoglobin digestion (<a href=\"#bib33\">Krugliak et al., 2002</a>), which may otherwise render the infected cells susceptible to osmotic challenge or, alternatively, increased protein degradation to survive nutrient starvation, in a manner analogous to that observed following isoleucine starvation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babbitt et al., 2012</a>). Whilst some consistencies with isoleucine-starved parasites were observed, it is important to note that the metabolomic impact of RhopH2 knockdown does not match directly with the metabolomic profile reported for isoleucine starvation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babbitt et al., 2012</a>), and that isoleucine levels in RhopH2 knockdown parasites were not significantly different from wild-type 3D7 (+GlcN) parasites."

We provide the first direct genetic evidence that depletion of a member of the RhopH complex leads to altered NPP function, and depletion of essential vitamins and cofactors. The alteration to parasite growth and metabolism, as well as the effect on parasite replication and delayed egress, are in keeping with the NPPs being an important erythrocyte modification induced by the parasite. Delineating the molecular makeup of the NPPs is critical for identifying the best strategies for targeting this pathway with anti-malarial drugs as well as understanding the mechanisms by which malaria parasites can potentially alter NPPs to develop resistance to particular chemotherapeutic agents."

Parasitemias in Giemsa-stained smears were determined by counting a minimum of 1000 erythrocytes and comparative growth analysis was performed using a student\u2019s t-test. Parasite growth of triplicate samples was also assessed using a modified Malstat assay protocol (<a href=\"#bib41\">Makler and Hinrichs, 1993</a>). For this, GlcN (Sigma) was added to blood cultures of synchronized PfRhopH2-HAglmS ring stage parasites (~5% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit) in cycle 1. In cycle 1 and cycle 2, when parasites were at trophozoite stage, three aliquots were removed for subsequent proliferation assays and the cultures then diluted 1/5 to 1/10 and seeded into new plates with fresh erythrocytes and GlcN. A final three aliquots were removed in cycle three when parasites were at trophozoite stage. To quantitate parasite biomass, 30 \u00b5L of culture was mixed with 75 \u00b5L Malstat reagent (0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 0.2 g/mL lactic acid, 0.2% v/v Triton X-100 and 1 mg/mL acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (Sigma), 0.01 mg/ml phenozine ethosulfate (Sigma) and 0.2 mg/mL nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). Once the no drug control wells had developed a purple color the absorbance was measured at 650 nm in a spectrophotometer. The cumulative absorbance values were calculated by subtracting the absorbance of uninfected erythrocytes from infected erythrocytes and multiplying by the combined dilution factor. The pLDH activities of 3D7 and RhopH2-HAglmS cultured in the absence of GlcN at cycle three were normalized to 100%, and activity of all lines (\u00b1 GlcN) at each day was measured relative to this. Data was analysed using a student\u2019s t-test."

After washing the parasitized erythrocytes twice in PBS, 10 \u00b5L at 1% hematacrit and 1% parasitemia (or PBS as a control) was dispensed in triplicate into a Thermo Scientific 96 well U bottom microplate and loaded into a Clariostar luminometer (BMG labtech). To each well, 40 \u00b5L of sorbitol or alanine lysis buffer containing the NanoGlo substrate (280 mM sorbitol or 280 mM L-alanine, 20 mM Na-HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4, Nano-Glo [1:1000 dilution]) was added and the relative light units (RLU) measured every 3 min with gain set to 2500. The percent lysis was determined by non-linear regression, exponential growth equation as analysed by GraphPad Prism software. The PBS control was subtracted and the value multiplied by 100 to get a percentage lysis. A value of 100% lysis is defined as the Nluc activity in relative light units (RLU/min) of parasites in 280 mM sorbitol or alanine buffer with no GlcN. A value of 0% lysis is defined as the Nluc activity of parasites in PBS containing nanoglo substrate. The rate of lysis was derived from a kinetic assay measuring the increase in RLU per minute (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dickerman et al., 2016</a>). Data was analysed for statistical significance using an unpaired student\u2019s t-test."

Heparin was added (100 \u03bcg/ml) to prevent any early invasion events and was subsequently removed when schizonts were observed (GlcN concentrations were maintained). Parasites were allowed to invade over a six-hour window (cycle 2) and were subsequently sorbitol synchronized prior to seeding into 96 well plates (100 \u00b5l/1% Hematocrit/1% parasitemia). Giemsa smears were taken at late schizont stage (end of cycle 2) and when rings were observed, the cultures were pelleted (500g/3 min) and 50 \u00b5l of supernatant containing released Nluc was removed for analysis (media fraction). Infected erythrocyte cell pellets were also collected. Fractions were collected every two hours for a total of 8 hr. Prior to analysis of total Nluc content, 50 \u03bcl of media containing 1% hemocrit was added to each media fraction and 50 \u03bcl of media was added to each pellet sample to maintain equivalent volumes. Each fraction was fully re-suspended and 10 \u00b5l was added to 90 \u00b5l lysis buffer (10 mM tris phosphoric acid, 5 mM Ka<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 0.2% NP40, 5 mM DTT, Nano-Glo (1:1000 dilution)) in a Greiner Lumitrac 96 well microplate prior to shaking (700 pm/30 s). Relative light units were measured with a ClARIOstar multimode plate reader (BMG Labtech) and data was subsequently analysed using GraphPad PRISM software."

For furosemide treatment, 500 \u00b5M of furosemide was added to the cultures shortly after invasion when parasites were in the early ring stages of cycle two and the cultures were harvested at\u00a0~24 hr post-invasion. Morphology of parasites was monitored by light microscopy to obtain developmentally similar stages of parasites under GlcN and furosemide treatment and untreated control cultures. Metabolism was quenched by rapidly cooling down the cultures to 4\u00b0C, culture medium was removed following centrifugation at 3000 <i>g</i> for five minutes) and metabolites were extracted from 4.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> cells using 150 \u00b5l of extraction buffer consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1 v/v) (spiked with 1 \u00b5M PIPES, CHAPS and Tris as internal standards) followed by vortex mixing for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C. After mixing, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C (&gt;15000 <i>g</i> for 10 min) and the supernatant was kept at \u221280\u00b0C prior to analysis. Three biological replicates were prepared for each cell line and treatment. Samples were analysed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) according to a previously published method (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stoessel et al., 2016</a>). All samples were analyzed as a single batch, in randomized order and pooled quality control samples were analyzed regularly throughout the batch to confirm reproducibility. Approximately 250 metabolite standards were analyzed immediately preceding the batch run to determine accurate retention times to facilitate metabolite identification. Additional retention times for metabolites lacking authentic standards were predicted computationally as previously described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Creek et al., 2011</a>). Data was analysed using the IDEOM workflow (<a href=\"#bib12\">Creek et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2012</a>). Peak areas for significant metabolites were confirmed by manual integration with Tracefinder software (Thermo\u00a0Scientific). Multivariate statistical analysis utilized principal component analysis (PCA) on log-transformed and auto-scaled metabolite peak intensity data using the web-based analytical tool, MetaboAnalyst (<a href=\"#bib70\">Xia et al., 2015</a>). The IDEOM files containing all metabolomics data are uploaded on Figshare and can be accessed at <a href=\"https://figshare.com/s/c38c0a98fb01634677f6\">https://figshare.com/s/c38c0a98fb01634677f6</a>."

They show by immunofluorescence that RhopH2-HA localizes to the parasite rhoptries, and is exported to the PV and beyond to the erythrocyte membrane after invasion. Using immune-precipitation combined with mass spectrometry, they identified parasite and host proteins interacting with RhopH2, including the other members of the RhopH complex (RhopH3 and clag). Using the glmS riboswitch, they could knockdown RhopH2 expression, resulting in a reduction of parasite growth and replication. A similar phenotype was observed in vivo with the rodent parasite <i>P. berghei</i> after conditional knockdown of PbRhopH2 using a tetracyclin-regulated system. The authors further show that in <i>P. falciparum</i> knocking-down RhopH2 does not affect protein export but leads to resistance of infected erythrocytes to sorbitol lysis, suggesting impairment of NPP function. Finally, a metabolomics analysis revealed several metabolites that were specifically perturbed in response to RhopH2 knockdown."
