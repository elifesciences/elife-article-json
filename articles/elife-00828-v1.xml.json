                    "text": "Ubiquitination by HECT E3 enzymes regulates myriad processes, including tumor suppression, transcription, protein trafficking, and degradation. HECT E3s use a two-step mechanism to ligate ubiquitin to target proteins. The first step is guided by interactions between the catalytic HECT domain and the E2\u223cubiquitin intermediate, which promote formation of a transient, thioester-bonded HECT\u223cubiquitin intermediate. Here we report that the second step of ligation is mediated by a distinct catalytic architecture established by both the HECT E3 and its covalently linked ubiquitin. The structure of a chemically trapped proxy for an E3\u223cubiquitin-substrate intermediate reveals three-way interactions between ubiquitin and the bilobal HECT domain orienting the E3\u223cubiquitin thioester bond for ligation, and restricting the location of the substrate-binding domain to prioritize target lysines for ubiquitination. The data allow visualization of an E2-to-E3-to-substrate ubiquitin transfer cascade, and show how HECT-specific ubiquitin interactions driving multiple reactions are repurposed by a major E3 conformational change to promote ligation."

HECT E3s use a two-step mechanism to ligate ubiquitin to target proteins. The first step is guided by interactions between the catalytic HECT domain and the E2\u223cubiquitin intermediate, which promote formation of a transient, thioester-bonded HECT\u223cubiquitin intermediate. Here we report that the second step of ligation is mediated by a distinct catalytic architecture established by both the HECT E3 and its covalently linked ubiquitin. The structure of a chemically trapped proxy for an E3\u223cubiquitin-substrate intermediate reveals three-way interactions between ubiquitin and the bilobal HECT domain orienting the E3\u223cubiquitin thioester bond for ligation, and restricting the location of the substrate-binding domain to prioritize target lysines for ubiquitination. The data allow visualization of an E2-to-E3-to-substrate ubiquitin transfer cascade, and show how HECT-specific ubiquitin interactions driving multiple reactions are repurposed by a major E3 conformational change to promote ligation."

There are approximately 600 different E3 enzymes in human cells that regulate a wide variety of target proteins. A major class of E3 enzymes, called HECT E3s, attaches ubiquitin to its targets in a unique two-step mechanism: the E2 enzymes covalently link a ubiquitin to a HECT E3 to form a complex that subsequently transfers the ubiquitin to its target protein. The ubiquitin is typically added to a particular amino acid, lysine, on the target protein, but the details of how HECT E3s execute this transfer are not well understood. To address this issue, Kamadurai et al. investigate how Rsp5, a HECT E3 ligase in yeast, attaches ubiquitin to a target protein called Sna3."

These lobes were previously thought to adopt various orientations relative to each other to deliver ubiquitin to sites on different target proteins (including to multiple lysines on a single target protein). Unexpectedly, Kamadurai et al. find that in order to transfer the ubiquitin to Sna3, Rsp5 adopts a discrete HECT domain architecture that creates an active site in which parts of the C-lobe and the N-lobe, which are normally separated, are brought together with a ubiquitin molecule. This architecture also provides a mechanism that dictates which substrate lysines can be ubiquitinated based on how accessible they are to this active site."

                        "text": "A prevailing mechanism for altering protein function involves post-translational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) via E1-E2-E3 trienzyme cascades. First, an E1 activating enzyme catalyzes formation of a transient E2\u223cUb intermediate, which is linked by a thioester bond between Ub\u2019s C-terminus and the catalytic cysteine of an E2 conjugating enzyme (here, \u2018\u223c\u2019 refers to a covalent protein\u2013protein interaction linked by a thioester, oxyester, or isopeptide bond, \u2018-\u2019 refers to a noncovalent interaction, and \u2018x\u2019 refers to a crosslinked complex). E3s subsequently utilize one of two general mechanisms to adjoin the activated Ub C-terminus with targets. E3s in the RING family promote transfer of Ub\u2019s C-terminus from the E2 catalytic cysteine to a substrate (<a href=\"#bib5\">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</a>). Notably, recent structural studies have revealed how isolated RING domains bind both E2 and Ub to optimally orient and activate the E2\u223cUb intermediate for nucleophilic attack (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Plechanovov\u00e1 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pruneda et al., 2012</a>). Many ligases utilize a different mechanism possessing an active site cysteine participating directly in catalysis via a two-step mechanism. First, Ub is transferred from an E2\u223cUb intermediate to the E3 catalytic cysteine to form a labile, thioester-linked E3\u223cUb intermediate. Second, Ub is transferred from the E3 cysteine to a substrate\u2019s primary amino group, which is typically from a lysine side-chain. This catalytic mechanism is common to many classes of E3s, including several effector proteins from bacterial pathogens, the RING-IBR-RING family, and HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) ligases (<a href=\"#bib46\">Scheffner et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rohde et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wenzel et al., 2011</a>). Despite the importance of thioester-forming E3s, the mechanisms by which Ub is ligated from an E3 cysteine remain elusive, because at the time of original manuscript submission there were no structures mimicking an E3\u223cUb intermediate, and to date there are none representing an E3\u223cUb-substrate complex."

Deregulation of HECT E3-mediated ubiquitination is associated with diseases such as cancers, neurological disorders, autoimmunity, and hypertension (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib1\">Bernassola et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rotin and Kumar, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Metzger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Scheffner and Kumar, 2013</a>).

Isolated C-terminal HECT catalytic domains are capable of binding E2\u223cUb, forming an E3\u223cUb intermediate, and ligating the E3-linked \u2018donor\u2019 Ub to a specific lysine on an \u2018acceptor\u2019 Ub to build a polyubiquitin chain (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib19\">Kee and Huibregtse, 2007</a>). Accessory domains upstream of the HECT domain recruit specific substrates for Ub ligation. The N-terminal sequences guide the classification of HECT E3s into different sub-families, the largest of which is the NEDD4-family. NEDD4-family members share a common domain organization with an N-terminal membrane binding C2 domain, two to four substrate-binding WW domains, and a C-terminal HECT domain. This modular architecture enables regulation and interactions (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib15\">Ingham et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kee and Huibregtse, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rotin and Kumar, 2009</a>). Substrates often contain recognition sequences that bind directly to one or more WW domains. For example, PPXY (Pro-Pro-X-Tyr) is one common targeting sequence. Some HECT substrates are multiprotein complexes, with the PPXY motif and ubiquitination sites located in different polypeptides. Also, many substrates of NEDD4-family E3s are transmembrane proteins in which the PPXY motif and ubiquitination sites reside in separate cytosolic segments. Furthermore, some substrates do not bind directly to NEDD4-family E3s, but are instead recruited by adaptor proteins bearing PPXY-like sequences (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib24\">L\u00e9on and Haguenauer-Tsapis, 2009</a>). In addition, for NEDD4-family E3s, a noncovalent ubiquitin binding site was discovered in the HECT domain, which promotes polyubiquitination through poorly understood mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib10\">French et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ogunjimi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Maspero et al., 2011</a>)."

A prior structure of an E2\u223cUb-HECT intermediate revealed that Ub transfer from an E2 to a NEDD4-family HECT E3 is directed by noncovalent interactions between the HECT domain N-lobe and E2, and by contacts between the HECT domain C-lobe and the E2-linked Ub (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kamadurai et al., 2009</a>). A structure published while the present work was under consideration showed preservation of this HECT domain-Ub conformation immediately upon generation of the E3\u223cUb intermediate (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kamadurai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Maspero et al., 2013</a>), but raised the question of how the E3\u223cUb thioester bond could be directed to a substrate. Although structural mechanisms underlying Ub ligation from the E3 to a substrate remain poorly understood, a prevailing model is that numerous different relative orientations of the N- and C-lobes, manifested in prior crystal structures of HECT domains, enable Ub ligation at spatially distinct sites associated with polyubiquitination of diverse substrates (<a href=\"#bib13\">Huang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Verdecia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ogunjimi et al., 2005</a>).

Rsp5 is required for proteasomal processing of a membrane-bound transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hoppe et al., 2000</a>). Rsp5 also functions in a multitude of diverse ubiquitin-dependent pathways including 26S proteasomal degradation of RNA polymerase II, and mediates proteasome-independent regulation of membrane protein trafficking (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib15\">Ingham et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kaliszewski and Zoladek, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rotin and Kumar, 2009</a>). Rsp5 has a typical NEDD4-family domain structure consisting of a C2 domain, three WW domains, and a HECT domain. Although the Rsp5 C2 domain is required for regulation of endocytosis, a construct comprising only the third WW and HECT domains (hereafter referred to as \u2018Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>\u2019) is sufficient to support viability under normal growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib49\">Springael et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hoppe et al., 2000</a>). Rsp5 substrates are typically modified either by a single Ub (\u2018monoUb\u2019) or by polyubiquitin chains containing isopeptide linkages between Lys63 and the C-terminus of the subsequent Ub in the chain (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shih et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kim and Huibregtse, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>). Several prior studies have suggested that the Rsp5 substrate Sna3, a small transmembrane protein that undergoes Ub-dependent sorting into the multivesicular body pathway, would be a good model for studying HECT E3-mediated Ub ligation, because both the Rsp5-binding sequence and a major ubiquitination site are encompassed in Sna3\u2019s soluble C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (<a href=\"#bib29\">McNatt et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Oestreich et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stawiecka-Mirota et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Watson and Bonifacino, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Macdonald et al., 2012</a>).

For an Rsp5 substrate, we turned to the cytoplasmic domain of Sna3 (hereafter Sna3<sup>C</sup>), because peptide-like substrates have proven to be very useful for providing insights into the ubiquitin ligation mechanisms of other families of E3 ligases. The corresponding minimal region of Rsp5 mediating Sna3<sup>C</sup> ubiquitination was identified through deletion mapping using a pulse-chase assay. Briefly, a thioester-bonded E2\u223cUb intermediate was enzymatically generated using E1, the E2 UbcH5B, and a fluorescently labeled version of Ub. After quenching formation of the E2\u223cUb intermediate, wild-type or truncation mutant versions of Rsp5 were added alongside a synthetic peptide corresponding to Sna3<sup>C</sup>. Formation of the Rsp5\u223cUb intermediate and the Sna3<sup>C</sup>\u223cUb product were monitored over time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thioester-linked intermediates were confirmed by their susceptibility to reduction by DTT (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Complexes in which Ub was linked via an isopeptide bond from autoubiquitination of Rsp5 or ligation to a lysine on Sna3<sup>C</sup> were not susceptible to reduction.

                                "text": "Interlobe flexibility observed upon comparing the structures of isolated HECT domains, and mutagenesis of residues linking the N- and C-lobes from a HECT domain, led to the idea that the N- and C-lobes adopt many different relative orientations during polyubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib13\">Huang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Verdecia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ogunjimi et al., 2005</a>). In this model, the catalytic requirements for ligation are encompassed exclusively in the C-lobe, its thioester-linked Ub, and the substrate. We considered that alternatively, tethering between the HECT domain N- and C-lobes could specify a limited set of distinct conformations for forming the thioester-linked E3\u223cUb intermediate and for ligation. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we performed comprehensive alanine mutagenesis of the HECT domain in Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>. We examined pulse-chase Ub ligation by 65 Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup> variants, each with one to four alanine mutations in the HECT domain (180 surface residues mutated in total) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The rates of Ub transfer to Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>\u2019s cysteine and subsequent ligation to the Sna3<sup>C</sup> peptide were too rapid to observe the thioester-linked E3\u223cUb intermediate at the earliest time-point in this assay. Thus, we considered that mutants displaying persistence of the E2\u223cUb intermediate would identify residues important for Ub transfer from E2 to the HECT domain. We anticipated that these mutations would map to the N- and C-lobe surfaces shown to bind E2\u223cUb in the prior crystal structure of a trapped E2\u223cUb-HECT complex (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kamadurai et al., 2009</a>). By contrast, mutants displaying accumulation of the Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>\u223cUb intermediate would indicate defective ligation. We hypothesized that if the HECT domain adopts a specific architecture for ligation, then some mutations in the N-lobe may also hinder ligation. Alternatively, if the two HECT domain lobes are flexibly tethered during ligation, we expected that mutations disrupting Ub transfer to Sna3<sup>C</sup> would map to the C-lobe, where Ub is linked. Results from the Ala scan revealed that mutations defective in the first catalytic step of E2-to-E3 transfer all map to the E2\u223cUb binding site and the N-lobe/C-lobe interface identified in the previous E2\u223cUb-HECT domain structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). By contrast, mutants that hindered Ub ligation to Sna3<sup>C</sup> map to distinctive surfaces on the N- and C-lobes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, the mutational data suggest a specific HECT domain architecture may be important for Ub ligation to Sna3<sup>C</sup>, and this conformation would involve both the catalytic C-lobe and the distal N-lobe packing differently from the arrangement promoting ubiquitin transfer from E2-to-E3."

                                "text": "To visualize the Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup> architecture mediating ligation, we devised a method to bypass the instability of an Rsp5\u223cUb thioester bond, allowing generation of a stable proxy for a HECT E3\u223cUb-substrate intermediate. A synthetic Sna3<sup>C</sup> peptide with the acceptor Lys125 substituted with azidohomoalanine was linked by Click chemistry to a homobifunctional maleimide crosslinker (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). One arm was crosslinked to Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>, and the other to a Cys side-chain substituted for Gly75 of Ub. This enabled us to determine the crystal structure of Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup> with the active site cysteine (Cys777) simultaneously crosslinked to the C-terminus of the Ub variant and to Sna3<sup>C</sup> (Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The crystals contained two Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> complexes per asymmetric unit, which superimpose with \u223c0.5 \u00c5 RMSD. Accordingly, only one is discussed here. The individual domains in Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> overlay well with previous HECT structures. Noncovalent interactions between the HECT domain C-lobe and Ub involved in Ub transfer from E2-to-E3 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kamadurai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Maspero et al., 2013</a>) are preserved in the Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> structure. The Sna3<sup>C</sup> PPXY motif binds Rsp5\u2032s WW3 domain in a typical manner (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vijay-Kumar et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kanelis et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>). However, the overall Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> assembly is distinctive, with the HECT domain active site and its covalently linked Ub facing the Sna3<sup>C</sup> substrate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Importantly, the locations of the HECT domain Ala scan mutations that selectively impaired ligation map to surfaces that anchor the Rsp5 lobes and Ub in the Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

On one side, the interface between Ub\u2019s globular domain and the HECT C-lobe superimposes with the corresponding region of the E2\u223cUb-HECT structure (0.99 \u00c5 RMSD) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Here, Ub\u2019s Ile36/Gln40/Leu71/Leu73 hydrophobic patch contacts Leu771, Leu798, Ala799, Glu802, and Thr803 of Rsp5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Accordingly, mutating these interface residues of Ub is lethal to yeast (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sloper-Mould et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kamadurai et al., 2009</a>), and Ub transfer from E2 is impaired for L771A/L798A and E802A/T803A/I804A mutant versions of Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup> tested in our Ala scan, and for the L73A mutant versions of Ub (<a href=\"#fig2 fig4\">Figures 2A and 4E</a>). The E3\u223cUb intermediate accumulates and the rate of Ub ligation to Sna3<sup>C</sup> is also slowed for these mutants, although a relatively lesser effect on Rsp5-mediated Ub ligation to substrate may reflect the larger interface stabilizing E3\u2013Ub interactions for the second reaction step (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Neither Ub transfer from E2 to Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup> nor from Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup> to Sna3<sup>C</sup> is substantially affected by an Ala substitution for Ub\u2019s Ile44, which does not make contacts in either the prior E2\u223cUb\u2013NEDD4L<sup>HECT</sup> or the current Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

Accordingly, the Arg559, Arg560, Phe561 triple Ala mutant was severely impaired in Ub ligation to Sna3<sup>C</sup>, with no defect in the rate of E2-to-Rsp5 Ub transfer in our assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>). Similarly, Arg501 from the N-lobe further anchors the C-lobe, and the combination of R501A and E502A mutations completely abrogates ligation in our assay, with a more severe defect than E502A alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013E</a>). There are lesser effects of mutating side-chains in the Lys432/Arg433/Asp434/Arg436 and Arg437/Lys438/Ile440/Tyr441 combinations in the N-lobe, and the Val745/Asn746/Lys749/Asp750 combination in the C-lobe, presumably because of their more peripheral locations in the interdomain interface (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

The F806A mutant was severely impaired in the Ala scan, and pulse-chase assays show specific defects in Ub ligation upon mutating either Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>\u2019s Phe806 to Leu, or the Phe505 and Leu506 from the N-lobe simultaneously to aspartates (<a href=\"#fig2 fig6\">Figures 2A and 6B</a>). Leu506 is adjacent to Arg461, and a bulky R461F mutation also hinders ligation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In agreement with the structural data, these mutations are ligation-specific, and do not impact formation of the thioester-linked Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>\u223cUb intermediate. We devised an experiment to dissect the role of the -4 Phe during ligation, by complementing the defect of the C-lobe F806L with a compensatory aromatic residue at position 506 of the N-lobe. Indeed, the defect from the F806L mutation in the C-lobe is largely ameliorated by complementary N-lobe L506W or L506F mutations both in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C\u2013E</a>). Moreover, rapid quench-flow kinetic analyses confirmed wild-type rates of E2-to-E3 Ub transfer for these mutants, and also observed 43-fold rescue in the rate of Ub ligation to Sna3<sup>C</sup> when the defective F806L mutant was combined with L506F mutation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). This compensation is selective, as L506F does not influence the deleterious effects of mutating the structurally distal residue Phe778, even after extended reaction times. Overall, these data demonstrate that an aromatic side-chain has a critical function in the ligation reaction by anchoring the two HECT domain lobes."

Deleting Rsp5\u2032s C-terminal residue severely impairs Ub ligation to Sna3<sup>C</sup>, although not to the same extent as the extremely deleterious D495A mutant identified in our Ala scan (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Our results are consistent with the recent finding that deleting Rsp5\u2032s C-terminal residue also impairs substrate-independent polyubiquitination by the isolated HECT domain from Rsp5 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Maspero et al., 2013</a>). However, although it has been suggested that a C-terminal acidic side-chain may perform a catalytic role in the ligation reaction (<a href=\"#bib27\">Maspero et al., 2013</a>), we observed no defect upon simultaneously mutating all three of Rsp5\u2032s C-terminal residues to alanines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), or mutating the Rsp5\u2032s C-terminal residue to Arg (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Future studies will be required to definitively determine the role of the C-terminus, which has not been observed in any structure of a HECT E3, including Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup>. However, we speculate that for Rsp5 and possibly other HECT E3s, the C-terminus itself may contribute to the ligation reaction. Indeed, C-terminal epitope tags have been shown to hinder activity (<a href=\"#bib44\">Salvat et al., 2004</a>). Alternatively, the C-terminus may stabilize the conformation of the HECT\u223cUb complex. In this regard, we note that in the Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> structure, the backbone amides from Leu73 and Arg74 and other portions of Ub\u2019s extended C-terminal tail are partially exposed and could potentially interact with the acidic C-terminus of the HECT domain (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

First, we determined the orientation of the thioesterified ubiquitin tail using constraints on the ubiquitin locations derived from the crystal structure. To accommodate the ubiquitin location, the catalytic cysteine must adopt the gauche+ rotamer, which allows formation of the thioester and its packing against His775, Thr776, and the noncovalent interactions between Ub and the Rsp5 C-lobe (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Given the geometric requirements for isopeptide bond formation, this rotameric preference directs the acceptor lysine\u2019s path of attack and all models predicted that Lys125 of Sna3 packs against Phe778 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). His775, Thr776, and Phe778 correspond to residues that also interact with E2\u223cUb during formation of the HECT E3\u223cUb intermediate (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kamadurai et al., 2009</a>). Their interaction with Ub was recently also observed in the structure of a HECT E3\u223cUb intermediate published while our manuscript was under consideration (<a href=\"#bib27\">Maspero et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, H775A and T776A mutations result in modest defects in Ub ligation to Sna3<sup>C</sup>, and an F778A mutation results in a more severe defect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). While all the models demonstrate a similar approach for Sna3 Lys125, modeling the additional residues between this Lys125 and the PPXY motif revealed multiple orientations that could accommodate a proper Lys125 active-site approach. Accordingly, neither Ala nor Glu substitutions adjacent to the acceptor lysine influenced substrate selection (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Accordingly, E491A and D495A Rsp5 mutants are also defective in supporting yeast growth (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). To gain initial insights into potential functions of this region, we superimposed the structure of the HECT domain N-lobe from NEDD4L (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kamadurai et al., 2009</a>) onto Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). This suggested that the 491\u2013495 loop from the N-lobe is located adjacent to the thioester bond between Ub and the catalytic Cys in the C-lobe, and provides a rationale for the importance of the HECT domain architecture for the ligation reaction. Structural modeling of this critical N-lobe loop using Rosetta suggests that Glu491 could contribute to positioning the loop and may participate in an electrostatic network involving Arg74 of Ub and Arg461 of Rsp5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Furthermore, these structural models demonstrate that the acidic loop can adopt several permissive orientations that allow the carboxyl group of Asp495 to approach the epsilon nitrogen of the acceptor lysine (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Asp495 may activate ubiquitin ligation through a variety of mechanisms including guiding the lysine into the active site or by contributing, either directly or indirectly, to the deprotonation of the substrate lysine. Direct deprotonation may be less likely as we were unable to rescue catalytic activity either with a D495H mutant, or chemically by adding high concentrations of formate or acetate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> and data not shown)."

There is a striking similarity in the effects of the Ala mutations in pulse-chase assays for Ub ligation to Sna3<sup>C</sup> and to free Ub as the substrate (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Some subtle differences appear due to the high concentration of free Ub ameliorating the deleterious effects of a few mutations on E2-to-E3 Ub transfer, potentially due to Ub\u2019s noncovalent association with the HECT domain N-lobe stabilizing the E2 binding site. Also, one mutant (L494A, Y496A) showed a greater defect in di-Ub synthesis, perhaps marking the site where Ub binds as a substrate. Nonetheless, the overall agreement between mutational effects on modification of the two distinctive substrates suggests that a specific HECT domain architecture is generally important for Rsp5-mediated Ub ligation."

A mechanism for prioritizing lysines for modification is suggested by the ligation-primed architecture of the Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> complex. In the structure, Ub\u2019s C-terminus and the E3 catalytic Cys face the C-terminus of the substrate\u2019s PPXY motif anchored to the WW3 domain.

In the structure, \u223c25 \u00c5 separates the HECT domain active site and the Sna3<sup>C</sup> PPXY motif. The distance predicts a requirement for a 10-residue spacer between the PPXY motif that binds the WW3 domain and the acceptor lysine that receives Ub from the HECT cysteine (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). By contrast, according to prior models suggesting that the domains are flexibly tethered during ligation, it would be possible to juxtapose the catalytic cysteine in the HECT domain C-lobe with a substrate lysine only two residues C-terminal of the WW3-bound PPXY motif in Sna3<sup>C</sup> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vijay-Kumar et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kanelis et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>). Thus, as a further test of the relevance of the fixed HECT domain architecture for ligation, we developed an assay for target lysine selectivity, using a TEV-cleavable HisMBP-fusion to Sna3<sup>C</sup> as a substrate. Fluorescent Ub\u223cE2 was added to a mixture of Rsp5<sup>WW1-3-HECT</sup> and HisMBP-TEV-Sna3<sup>C</sup>, and Ub transfer was terminated by adding DTT to reduce thioester-linked intermediates. After treatment with TEV protease, the levels of fluorescent Ub-ligated Sna3<sup>C</sup>, HisMBP, and autoubiquitinated Rsp5<sup>WW1-3-HECT</sup> were compared (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For wild-type HisMBP-TEV-Sna3<sup>C</sup>, Ub is predominantly ligated to Sna3<sup>C</sup>. Without HisMBP-TEV-Sna3<sup>C</sup>, or with a mutant disrupting the HisMBP-TEV-Sna3<sup>C</sup> PPXY motif, Ub is ligated to Rsp5<sup>WW1-3-HECT</sup> itself. Conversely, if a HisMBP-TEV-Sna3<sup>C</sup> with a K125A mutation that eliminates Sna3 ubiquitination but still retains its Rsp5-binding PPXY motif is used, Ub is ligated to both HisMBP and Rsp5<sup>WW1-3-HECT</sup>. Therefore, the distribution of Ub-ligated Sna3<sup>C</sup>, HisMBP, and Rsp5<sup>WW1-3-HECT</sup> products distinguishes preferences among different Ub-accepting lysines on substrates recruited via the same PPXY motif (Sna3<sup>C</sup> vs HisMBP), and on Rsp5<sup>WW1-3-HECT</sup> autoubiquitination as an internal control for ligation activity. To test whether the relative position of a lysine influences its ubiquitination, we performed assays with insertion and deletion mutants in the 15-residue linker between the PPXY motif and Ub-acceptor lysine of Sna3<sup>C</sup>. While substrates were generally tolerant of insertions, reducing the linker to nine residues, irrespective of the sequence location, dramatically decreased Sna3<sup>C</sup> ubiquitination while increasing ubiquitination of HisMBP and Rsp5<sup>WW1-3-HECT</sup>. The strong spatial preference for target lysines suggests that the Rsp5 domains are not freely rotating during ligation. Furthermore, the sharp decline in ubiquitination upon reducing the number of residues linking the Ub acceptor lysine below 10 strongly correlates with the distance between the C-terminus of the Sna3<sup>C</sup> PPXY motif and the Rsp5 active site in the Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> structure. Importantly, the N-terminally fused HisMBP was inefficiently ubiquitinated, despite containing 36 lysines. Nor was a lysine placed N-terminal to the PPXY motif. Overall, poor ubiquitination correlated with the structural location of the N-terminus of the PPXY motif, which projects away from the active site, although there may also be some context dependence to substrate selection based on the low activity toward an L121K K125A mutant (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data are also consistent with in vivo data showing that K125 is the major ubiquitination site of Sna3 and a Sna3-GFP fusion protein, with the GFP moiety undergoing a lower level of ubiquitination via its 20 lysines (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stawiecka-Mirota et al., 2007</a>). Notably, the minimum required linker also correlates with the 12-14 residues between the LPXY motif and Ub acceptor lysines in the Rsp5 substrate Mga2p120 (<a href=\"#bib3a\">Bhattacharya et al., 2009</a>). Overall, the data indicate that the HECT E3 architecture primed for ligation prioritizes potential target lysines by their placement relative to a composite catalytic center for ubiquitination."

                        "text": "We anticipate that other E3s functioning via a catalytic cysteine, including several effector proteins from bacterial pathogens and members of the RING-IBR-RING family (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rohde et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wenzel et al., 2011</a>), also activate Ub ligation through parallel mechanisms that align their E3\u223cUb intermediates. This theme is reflected by how mechanistically unrelated E3s (e.g., a SUMO E3 in the \u2018neither-HECT-nor-RING\u2019 class, and Ub E3s in the RING family) bind both E2 and its thioester-linked Ub-like protein (Ubl) to reduce conformational heterogeneity and optimally orient the E2\u223cUbl nucleophilic attack (<a href=\"#bib39\">Reverter and Lima, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pruneda et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Dou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Plechanovova et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pruneda et al., 2012</a>). Nonetheless, there are notable mechanistic differences between HECT E3s. For example, prior to the ligation reaction, there are differences during Ub transfer from the E2. For HECT E3s, orientation of the E2\u223cUb thioester bond involves extensive interactions between Ub and its \u2018target\u2019\u2014the C-lobe to which Ub will be transferred. By contrast, RING domains apparently orient the E2\u223cUb thioester bond for nucleophilic attack even in the absence of any downstream acceptor. As a result, RING E3s promote discharge of associated E2\u223cUb thioester intermediates, whereas E2\u223cUb complexes are stable in the presence of catalytic Cys mutant versions of HECT domains. Another mechanistic difference is reflected by exposure of Ub\u2019s Ile44 in HECT E3 intermediates, whereas for RING and related E3s the enzyme bearing the thioester-bound Ub binds the notorious \u2018I44 patch\u2019 on Ub to orient the thioester bond. Thus, different E3 families have evolved distinct approaches to activate Ub transfer to appropriate targets."

                        "text": "A major question is how lysines are selected for Ub and Ub-like protein modification. To date, this is best understood for E3-independent interactions between E2s and substrates, including Ub during polyubiquitination. These include Ubc9 binding a specific SUMO target sequence (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernier-Villamor et al., 2002</a>), Ube2S binding an acidic portion of Ub that completes its catalytic site (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wickliffe et al., 2011</a>), and Ubc13 binding a partner protein that presents a specific Ub target lysine (<a href=\"#bib8\">Eddins et al., 2006</a>). Mechanisms underlying RING E3 presentation of substrates are generally less understood. For example, different members of the SCF family of RING E3s appear to utilize distinct selections: context is a major determinant of target lysines during SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup>-dependent ubiquitination of Sic1 in vivo, (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sadowski et al., 2010</a>), spatial proximity to the noncovalent binding site is important for in vitro ubiquitination of \u03b2-catenin by un-neddylated SCF<sup>\u03b2-TRCP</sup> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wu et al., 2003</a>), and future studies will be required to determine mechanisms dictating substrate lysine selection by NEDD8-activated SCF E3s. Our data show how a NEDD4-family HECT E3\u2019s architecture prioritizes lysines recruited to a WW domain by their placement relative to a composite catalytic center that involves residues from both HECT domain lobes. Although future studies will be required to reveal how substrates recruited to other domains of HECT E3s are selected for ubiquitination, conservation of key residues indicates that the ligation mechanism used by Rsp5 broadly applies to a range of HECT E3s controlling numerous physiological processes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

                        "text": "Following Ub ligation, the HECT domain must reload with Ub, requiring C-lobe rotation to receive another Ub from E2. This may be stimulated by discharge of Ub from the HECT domain onto the substrate, which would diminish the number of contacts at the junction between the HECT domain N- and C-lobes, allowing the C-lobe to both face E2 and separate from Ub. Notably, our mutational data also suggest utilization of a common HECT domain catalytic architecture for both substrate ligation and Ub chain formation (<a href=\"#fig2 fig8\">Figures 2A and 8</a>). Although additional investigation will be required to reveal how Ub itself is positioned as an acceptor for polyubiquitination, we note that the HECT C-lobe region we found to interact noncovalently with the donor Ub determines ubiquitin chain lysine specificity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kim and Huibregtse, 2009</a>). We speculate that during polyubiquitination, the sum of weak interactions between HECT E3 domains and various substrates, adaptors, and regulators, sequentially drives the conformational pathway toward the active form at each step in HECT E3 cascades."

All reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) carried out on EMD Chemicals silica gel 60-F 254 coated glass plates and visualized using I<sub>2</sub> or UV light (254 nm). Analysis by LC-MS was performed by using an XBridge C18 column run at 1 ml/min, and using gradient mixtures of (A) water (0.05% TFA) and (B) methanol. Low-resolution mass spectra (ESI) were collected on a Waters Micromass ZQ in positive-ion mode. Flash-chromatography was performed on a Biotage SP4 chromatography system using Biotage Flash KP-Sil and KP-NH amine pre-packed columns. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on Bruker Avance II NMR spectrometer at 400 MHz for <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra. Chemical shifts (ppm) are reported relative to TMS or the solvent peak. Signals are designated as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublet; t, triplet; q, quadruplet; m, multiplet.

The UBQ_E2_thioester application generates a thioester-bonded complex and samples torsion angles for the thioester and nearby residues, including cysteine chi1 and 2, Gly76 phi and pseudo-psi, Gly75 phi and psi, Arg74 phi and psi, and Leu73 phi and psi (<a href=\"#bib43\">Saha et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, this code was modified to model the location of terminal Ub acceptor, positioning the NZ of the acceptor lysine collinear with the carbonyl bond and 2.4 \u00c5 from the carbonyl carbon on the C-terminal glycine of Ub. Input structures for Rsp5, Ub, and Sna3 were obtained from the Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> co-crystals. Several constraints were placed on the Ub position derived from the Rsp5<sup>WW3-HECT</sup>xUbxSna3<sup>C</sup> three-dimensional structure. We focused on recovering the \u03b2-strand pairing between the Ub tail and the C-lobe active site. To precisely position the Ub tail, we introduced two angle constraints between the backbones of Ser774 of Rsp5 and Leu74 of Ub. As a preliminary step, we modeled five-residue Ub tails to determine the range of thioester torsion angles that could accommodate the \u03b2-sheet pairing and applied these angles to the starting pose. Additionally, we decreased the size of the moves on the cysteine chi1 and thioester bond to obtain more models with optimal geometry; even with this change models with various cysteine chi1 and thioester torsion angles were recovered. We filtered the subsequent models on constraint energy, RMSD to Ub, and visual inspection, and selected the top five models."

We used a two-step protocol to close and refine the loop. First, we used perturb KIC to close the loop in the absence of the Sna3 peptide and substituted the corrected amino acid identities that varied in the grafted NEDD4L loop. We allowed backbone sampling for residues 488\u2013498, and selected the lowest energy closed loop; about 5% of the models had successfully closed N-lobe loops. Next, we refined the loop in the presence of the Sna3<sup>C</sup> peptide, both with and without a 3 \u00c5 distance constraint between the acceptor lysine and Asp495 side chain. Although the loop could adopt multiple orientations that could bring these residues in close proximity, without this constraint Rosetta favored orientations that placed Asp495 more distant from the acceptor lysine. We examined the models scoring in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile and found that about half of them had a very similar loop orientation and choose a representative structure from this set."

Ubiquitylation is an essential posttranslational modification that controls many aspects of cellular behavior. HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligases were the first E3s to be discovered, and they are known to play many important roles in cellular signaling. HECT-E3s often catalyze monoubiquitylation reactions, during which they specifically modify a lysine residue in a substrate with ubiquitin; alternatively, HECT-E3s are also able to decorate substrates with ubiquitin chains, requiring an initial modification of a substrate lysine and subsequent repetitive modification of specific ubiquitin lysine residues. How HECT-E3s catalyze transfer of ubiquitin to a lysine residue in the substrate has remained poorly understood."

By determining the Lys preference in Rps5-substrates, as well as by alanine scanning of most of the HECT-domain, they first provide convincing evidence that a specific orientation of N- and C-lobe, and the substrate-binding WW-domain of Rsp5 is important for ubiquitin transfer to the substrate. A key advance reported in the paper is the clever use of an artificial residue that was incorporated in the substrate peptide, replacing the lysine that is normally present. The artificial residue incorporated a dual-headed maleimide, which allowed simultaneous crosslinking of the Cys residue of the HECT E3 as well as the terminal residue of the ubiquitin. This allowed stabilization of the otherwise transient complex between the substrate and the charged E3, and crystallographic visualization of the complex."

The model presented by the authors is that the HECT E2 switches between two states, one for charging by E2 and one for transferring the ubiquitin to the substrate. The structure determined by the authors shows that the docking of the substrate to a WW domain attached to the HECT domain places steric constraints on the distance of the ubiquitylated lysine from the WW docking site. This is consistent with their biochemical analysis, which shows that if the lysine is too close to the WW docking site then ubiquitylation is inefficient. The authors then validate their structure through multiple approaches, including the rescue of mutants in the C-lobe through mutation of opposing residues in the N-lobe, and using a point mutant equivalent to a key mutation in Angelman\u2019s Syndrome, they underscore the medical relevance of their studies. The Lys residue modified in Sna3, as well as a loop in Rsp5 close to its active site were not resolved in their structure, so the authors used modeling approaches based on their structure to probe the orientation of these residues."
