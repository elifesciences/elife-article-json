                    "text": "The AP2 clathrin adaptor complex links protein cargo to the endocytic machinery but it is unclear how AP2 is activated on the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that the membrane-associated proteins FCHo and SGIP1 convert AP2 into an open, active conformation. We screened for <i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>elegans</i> mutants that phenocopy the loss of AP2 subunits and found that AP2 remains inactive in <i>fcho-1</i> mutants. A subsequent screen for bypass suppressors of <i>fcho-1</i> nulls identified 71 compensatory mutations in all four AP2 subunits. Using a protease-sensitivity assay we show that these mutations restore the open conformation in vivo. The domain of FCHo that induces this rearrangement is not the F-BAR domain or the \u00b5-homology domain, but rather is an uncharacterized 90 amino acid motif, found in both FCHo and SGIP proteins, that directly binds AP2. Thus, these proteins stabilize nascent endocytic pits by exposing membrane and cargo binding sites on AP2."

Here we demonstrate that the membrane-associated proteins FCHo and SGIP1 convert AP2 into an open, active conformation. We screened for <i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>elegans</i> mutants that phenocopy the loss of AP2 subunits and found that AP2 remains inactive in <i>fcho-1</i> mutants. A subsequent screen for bypass suppressors of <i>fcho-1</i> nulls identified 71 compensatory mutations in all four AP2 subunits. Using a protease-sensitivity assay we show that these mutations restore the open conformation in vivo. The domain of FCHo that induces this rearrangement is not the F-BAR domain or the \u00b5-homology domain, but rather is an uncharacterized 90 amino acid motif, found in both FCHo and SGIP proteins, that directly binds AP2. Thus, these proteins stabilize nascent endocytic pits by exposing membrane and cargo binding sites on AP2."

The AP2 core complex contains binding sites for membrane phospholipids and endocytic cargo while the appendages bind clathrin and accessory proteins that coordinate endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Traub and Bonifacino, 2013</a>). AP2 thereby binds target proteins on the surface of the cell and assembles the machinery necessary for internalization of cargo."

Cocrystallization with cargo peptides led to partially open or fully open conformations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kelly et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). The open conformation places the cargo- and membrane-binding pockets in coplanar face of the complex and is therefore thought to be the active form of AP2. It has been difficult to determine whether AP2 reorganization is an obligatory process in vivo."

Alternatively, AP2 might require association with clathrin and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate to bind cargo at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rapoport et al., 1997</a>). Another model suggests that the open form of AP2 is induced by phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fingerhut et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Olusanya et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Conner and Schmid, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ricotta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Honing et al., 2005</a>).

Examples include Epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 (Eps15), intersectin, and most recently, Fer/CIP4 Homology domain only (FCHo) proteins (Syp1p in yeast) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stimpson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>). The role of FCHo at endocytic sites is poorly defined. In <i>syp1</i> mutants, which encodes the yeast homolog of FCHo, endocytic patches are less frequent, but still progress to coated pits (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reider et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Stimpson et al., 2009</a>). When FCHo proteins were knocked down in tissue culture cells, AP2 failed to bind membrane (<a href=\"#bib16\">Henne et al., 2010</a>). However, others found that knockdown of FCHo did not prevent AP2 association with the membrane (<a href=\"#bib44\">Umasankar et al., 2012</a>) but that there is an increased tendency for endocytic events to abort (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cocucci et al., 2012</a>) with flat clathrin plaques forming rather than clathrin-coated pits (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012</a>). These studies suggest that FCHo might regulate AP2 during the formation of a clathrin-coated pit. On the other hand, there is evidence that FCHo may be acting in a parallel endocytic pathway with ESCRT0 in <i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mayers et al., 2013</a>). In fish, FCHo appears to act in BMP signaling during development (<a href=\"#bib44\">Umasankar et al., 2012</a>). Thus it is unclear whether FCHo proteins function via AP2 or in parallel to AP2 in clathrin coat assembly, or in an entirely unrelated pathway."

In FCHo mutants in the nematode <i>C. elegans</i>, AP2 is functionally inactive and endocytosis of surface cargo is reduced. However, the requirement for FCHo can be bypassed by mutations in AP2 that specifically destabilize the closed conformation of AP2. FCHo is comprised of an F-BAR domain (<a href=\"#bib17\">Henne et al., 2007</a>), a linker region, and a C-terminal \u03bc-homology domain related to the medium subunit of AP2 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reider et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Stimpson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>). The region of FCHo that is required for activation of AP2 is not the F-BAR or the \u03bc-homology domain but rather a conserved region found in the linker called the AP2 activator domain (APA). This small domain from all metazoan orthologs of FCHo proteins, including SH3-containing GRB2-like protein 3-interacting protein 1 (SGIP1), binds AP2 and is sufficient to activate the AP2 complex in vivo in the absence of the endogenous FCHo protein. We propose that the FCHo/SGIP class of proteins evolved to promote endocytosis by binding to, and stabilizing the open conformation of AP2."

We screened for mutants with the jowls phenotype and identified multiple mutations in three genes coding for alpha adaptin, mu2 adaptin and the nematode homolog of FCHo (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We generated a deletion allele <i>fcho-1(ox477)</i> by transposon excision (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>); all six mutant alleles of <i>fcho-1</i> produced defects strikingly similar to mutants lacking AP2 subunits, including the \u2018jowls\u2019 phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that AP2 function is compromised in the absence of FCHo."

The fluorescence signal recovered approximately three times faster after bleaching in the absence of FCHo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>).

To increase the probability of getting missense mutations we used the mutagen <i>N</i>-ethyl-<i>N</i>-nitrosourea (ENU), which can generate transversions and can therefore swap charges, or hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. In addition, we designed a multigenerational screen to select for subtle improvements in fitness. Wild-type animals grow rapidly and starve a culture plate in 5 days, whereas <i>fcho-1</i> mutants exhibit reduced fecundity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) and require twice as long to consume the same amount of food (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). We selected for suppressors that rapidly starved plates, and identified 71 dominant mutations that confer increased fitness to <i>fcho-1</i> mutants and suppressed the jowls phenotype. All of these suppressed strains contained second site missense mutations in one of the four subunits of AP2 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and none exhibited loss-of-function phenotypes for these adaptin genes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). These mutations all occur at conserved amino acids, and cluster at sites likely to stabilize the closed (inactive) conformation when placed on the crystal structures of AP2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Collins et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kelly et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). These mutations can be classified into four groups: (1) residues that lie in the bowl-like interface between the mu2 subunit and the other three subunits, (2) residues that stabilize the insertion of the N-terminus of the beta subunit into the cargo binding motif of sigma, (3) residues in the alpha subunit that are found in the helical solenoid that lies across the top of the complex, and (4) the phosphorylation site on the mu2 subunit. It is likely that these mutations destabilize the closed conformation of AP2, suggesting that the open conformation of AP2 may bypass the requirement for FCHo. In other words, these mutations would promote an open conformation of AP2, suggesting that AP2 may dwell in the closed state in the absence of FCHo."

The mu2 subunit of AP2 becomes sensitive to trypsin when the complex is incorporated into clathrin coats (<a href=\"#bib25\">Matsui and Kirchhausen, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilar et al., 1997</a>). The protease-sensitive segment is contained within \u223c15 residues that are not resolved in crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib31\">Owen and Evans, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Heldwein et al., 2004</a>), but the boundaries of this segment are apposed to the internal face of the sigma subunit in the closed structure, and are exposed on the exterior of the complex in the open structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Because this poorly conserved region tolerates the insertion of various tags (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nesterov et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>), we inserted a TEV cleavage site in this sequence, and replaced the endogenous <i>apm-2</i> gene with the protease-sensitive version of mu2 tagged with HA (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We used a temperature-inducible promoter to transiently drive expression of TEV protease in these transgenic worms. After heat-shock induction of the protease, the level of the full-length subunit declined and a smaller 25kd N-terminal fragment accumulated over a 8 hr period (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>) The mu2 cleavage rate was slower in <i>fcho-1</i> mutants even though the protease was induced to a similar level (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B-D</a>). TEV-sensitivity was also demonstrated for a FLAG-tagged version of mu2, which was used in the structure-function experiments described below (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

These data suggest that AP2 is in the closed conformation in the absence of FCHo and that single amino acid changes in the complex are sufficient to tip the equilibrium toward the active conformation. Indeed, the amount of rescue observed in the cargo assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) was grossly correlated with protease sensitivity. However, none of these mutations fully restored cargo endocytosis, even though all of the suppressors rescued growth and morphology (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and not shown). Only the mutation that resulted in a profoundly protease\u2013hypersensitive complex (\u03bcE306K) increased cargo internalization with high significance in <i>fcho-1</i> mutants.

To verify that the closed structure has in vivo significance we identified a mutation among our suppressors that would disrupt a salt bridge in the closed conformation, and used the crystal structure to predict a compensatory mutation that would restore the salt bridge. In the closed conformation \u03b2 (E361) forms a salt bridge to \u03bc (K411) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We therefore analyzed mutations in \u03b2 (E361K) and \u03bc (K411E) that break this salt bridge, and found that both suppressed the <i>fcho-1</i> mutant phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These mutations also increased protease sensitivity relative to the <i>fcho-1</i> mutant, and increased phosphorylation of threonine-160 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Similar to previous results (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), only the mutation that produced an acutely open complex (\u03bcK411E) significantly rescued the cargo-recycling defect of <i>fcho-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We then constructed the double mutant containing both the \u03b2E361K and \u03bcK411E mutations which should restore the salt bridge. The two mutations together no longer suppressed the <i>fcho-1</i> growth phenotype or cargo retrieval defect of the <i>fcho-1</i> mutants, and reversed the protease sensitivity of the single mutants. Phosphorylation of T160 in the double mutant was reduced relative to the \u03bcK411E single mutant but was not fully restored to fcho(\u2212) levels. These results confirm that the closed form as determined by crystallography predominates in the <i>fcho-1</i> mutant and that destabilizing the closed form can bypass the requirement for FCHO-1."

The AP2 complex associates with the plasma membrane with different lifetimes; some AP2 clusters are aborted rapidly (between 5\u201316 s) whereas others develop into fully committed pits (90 s) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Loerke et al., 2009</a>). In the absence of FCHo, the lifetime of AP2 at the membrane in cultured cells is quite brief (&lt;10 s), whereas overexpression of FCHo stabilizes AP2 and promotes the growth of clathrin-coated pits with long lifespans (&gt;25 s) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Henne et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cocucci et al., 2012</a>). We observe a similar phenotype in <i>fcho-1</i> mutants: although AP2 still associates with the plasma membrane, it does not form clusters. Moreover, the dwell time of AP2 on the membrane is shorter; in <i>fcho-1</i> mutants worms, the lifespan of AP2 on the membrane is reduced from 35 to 10 s. These results are strikingly similar to the observations of Cocucci et al (2012)."

Our data suggest that FCHo acts directly on AP2: a 90 amino acid segment of the linker domain binds the AP2 complex in pulldowns from HEK293 cells. The linker region of human FCHo1 was previously shown to interact with AP2 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Umasankar et al., 2012</a>). This interaction was thought to be via the appendage domain of the alpha subunit of AP2, however we find that the interior of the linker binds the core complex. This AP2 activator domain (APA) is conserved and this fragment from the nematode FCHO-1 protein or from the mammalian FCHo1, FCHo2 and SGIP1 proteins can rescue <i>fcho-1</i> mutant worms. It is curious to note that while the APA domain is conserved in metazoan orthologs of FCHO-1, it is absent in the yeast ortholog Syp1p (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reider et al., 2009</a>)."

Although the APA domain rescues <i>fcho-1</i> mutants to grossly wild-type morphology and behavior, it does not fully rescue at a cellular level: endocytosis of cargo is not restored to wild-type levels by expression of the APA fragment. Full rescue is only observed when the rescuing constructs include both the APA domain and the \u03bc-homology domain. We have confirmed that the \u03bc-homology domains of FCHo proteins bind Eps15 and Eps15-like proteins in pulldowns from HEK293 cells by extending the bait proteins to include this domain (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). It is therefore likely that binding of FCHo to Eps15 is required for endocytosis of cargo. It has been demonstrated that FCHo forms an independent complex with Eps15 and Intersectin and that this complex functions in the recruitment of cargo to clathrin-coated pits (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mayers et al., 2013</a>)."

By contrast, neither the F-BAR domain of FCHO-1 or the membrane association domain of SGIP are required for rescue of <i>fcho-1</i> mutants. The dispensable nature of the F-BAR domain conflicts with models in which this domain must bend the membrane for clathrin-coated pit formation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Henne et al., 2010</a>), and instead suggests that the most important feature of the F-BAR domain is its ability to localize the APA domain to the membrane. Apparently in <i>C. elegans</i>, the APA domain of FCHo can be recruited to the membrane via interactions with other proteins independent of the F-BAR domain. Nevertheless, the presence of a membrane-binding motif in all FCHo and SGIP proteins demonstrate that membrane interactions are important and conserved."

Among the bypass suppressors of <i>fcho-1</i> were seven residues at the contact interface of the latched state. In the open structure, the mu domain is expelled from the bowl formed by the other subunits, and about half of the suppressors (34/71) were found in contact residues between mu2 and the bowl. The alpha hinge domain flexes as the bowl collapses in the open state, and 19 mutations in the alpha hinge were identified. We isolated 7 other mutations in residues that reside near inter-subunit contacts in the closed conformation.

A z-stack of half of the coelomocyte was acquired at maximum speed (200 ms exposure per slice) with 0.2 \u00b5m spacing. Fluorescence was excited with a 488 nm laser and was filtered through a 500\u2013550 nm bandpass filter to an EMCCD (C9100-23B, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The images were then analyzed using a set of custom written plugins (available at <a href=\"http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins\">http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins</a>) in ImageJ (<a href=\"http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/\">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</a>). We started by creating a maximum intensity projection of the data. Next, the user specified an ROI inside the coelomocyte that does not include the outermost membrane. The mean intensity and standard deviation of the ROI was then measured for each time point. The coefficient of variance (%CV) was then calculated and averaged for all time points and all worms per sample. Additionally, histograms of pixel intensities inside the coelomocytes were taken from the exact same ROI as the %CV measurements. The mode of a logarithmic histogram with a bin size of 1000 was used as the background intensity. The mode was then subtracted from the histogram. A value of 15,000 was then added back to the image and a new logarithmic histogram with bin size of 1000 was measured. This was necessary to avoid zero or negative values in the histogram. The bin width of the histogram was set to 1000 for all images, while the number of bins was allowed to vary. For each sample, all of the histograms were aligned to the mode and summed. Each point of the resulting histogram was then normalized to the integral of the histogram."

On both microscopes, fluorescence was excited with a 488 nm laser and emission was collected in the 500\u2013550 nm range. On the LSM 780, emission was collected in photon counting mode range with a temporal resolution of 2 s and a pinhole close to 1 airy unit. Four images were acquired prior to bleaching of a manually selected ROI with maximum 488 nm laser power. On the spinning disk, emission was collected with an EMCCD camera (Hamamatsu C9100-23B). Five images were acquired at maximum speed (exposure 100\u2013200ms) to determine the average fluorescence intensity of the coelomocyte membrane. Bleaching was then achieved over a user specified ROI, using a 488 nm laser (the duration of bleaching was less than five seconds). Recovery images were then captured for 3 min with a rate of 1 image per second. Data was analyzed using a custom written plugin (available at <a href=\"http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins\">http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins</a>) for ImageJ (<a href=\"http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/\">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</a>). This macro first registered the image sequences to compensate for movement of the worm/coelomocyte. Then the user specified the bleach ROI. The mean intensity of the ROI was then plotted per time point. A fit to the data was achieved with a one component fluorescence recovery model. The tau (inverse rate) values from the fits were then averaged for all worms per sample. For average plots of fluorescence recovery, curves were normalized so that the minimum value was 0 and the maximum value was 1 prior to averaging."

Loaded microcapillary columns were placed in-line with a Quaternary Agilent 1100 series HPLC pump and a LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoScientific, San Jose, CA). Fully automated 10-step MudPIT runs were carried out on the electrosprayed peptides, as described in (<a href=\"#bib10\">Florens and Washburn, 2006</a>). Tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra were interpreted using SEQUEST (<a href=\"#bib8\">Eng et al., 1994</a>) against a database consisting of 30,499 non-redundant human proteins (NCBI, 2012-08-27 release), 160 usual contaminants (human keratins, IgGs, and proteolytic enzymes), as well the mouse and <i>C. elagans</i> FCHo constructs and the mouse SGIP1 sequences. To estimate false discovery rates (FDR)s, the amino acid sequence of each non-redundant protein entry was randomized to generate a virtual library. This resulted in a total library of 61,327 non-redundant sequences against which the spectra were matched. Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tabb et al., 2002</a>) with the following criteria set: Spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.08, and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly-, 2.0 for doubly-, and 3.0 for triply-charged spectra. In addition, peptides had to be fully tryptic and at least seven amino acids long. Combining all runs, proteins had to be detected by at least two such peptides, or one peptide with two spectra. Under these criteria the averaged FDRs at the protein and peptide levels were 0.24% \u00b1 0.2 and 0.44% \u00b1 0.3, respectively. Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tabb et al., 2002</a>). To estimate relative protein levels, distributed Normalized Spectral Abundance Factors (dNSAFs) were calculated for each detected protein/protein group, as described in (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). The open source BioConductor package plgem in R was used to statistically compare the proteins detected in the FCHo and SGIP1 samples to negative controls (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pavelka et al., 2008</a>). Proteins were considered significantly enriched compared to the control datasets if their p-values for power law global error model signal-to-noise (PLGEM-STN) ratios were lower than 0.001, and they were detected in at least 2 out of 3 replicate analyses of the FCHo and SGIP1 purifications. The top 10 proteins (in addition to bait) were ranked based on decreasing PLGEM-STN values for FCHo2 APA, decreasing STN and dNSAF values for SGIP1 APA and full length (FL) SGIP1, and decreasing dNSAF values for FCHo2 FL and FCHo2 without the F-BAR domain (\u0394BAR)."

Taking advantage of <i>C. elegans</i> genetics, the authors identify an enormous set of mutations within subunits of the AP-2 complex during an <i>fcho</i> mutant suppressor screen. The mutations cluster in a manner that suggests they stabilize an open conformation for the AP-2 complex. Indeed, using an elegant in vivo protease sensitivity assay, several bypass mutants show enhanced cleavage, suggesting that they exist in a more open state. Additional experiments, including a clever second site suppressor analysis, further support this conclusion. The authors also identify a short, conserved sequence in FCHo (the APA domain), which is sufficient to promote AP-2 activity and rescue a subset of phenotypes exhibited by <i>fcho</i> mutant animals. In general, the work is rigorous and convincing, finally highlighting the relevance of different conformational states to AP-2 function in vivo. Nonetheless, the following issues should be addressed before publication can be recommended."
