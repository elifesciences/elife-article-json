This dilemma, common to most flowering plants, could be solved by not producing nectar and/or scent, thereby cheating pollinators. Both nectar and scent are highly variable in native populations of coyote tobacco, <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>, with some producing no nectar at all, uncorrelated with the tobacco's main floral attractant, benzylacetone. By silencing benzylacetone biosynthesis and nectar production in all combinations by RNAi, we experimentally uncouple these floral rewards/attractrants and measure their costs/benefits in the plant's native habitat and experimental tents. Both scent and nectar increase outcrossing rates for three, separately tested, pollinators and both traits increase oviposition by a hawkmoth herbivore, with nectar being more influential than scent. These results underscore that it makes little sense to study floral traits as if they only mediated pollination services."

This dilemma, common to most flowering plants, could be solved by not producing nectar and/or scent, thereby cheating pollinators. Both nectar and scent are highly variable in native populations of coyote tobacco, <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>, with some producing no nectar at all, uncorrelated with the tobacco's main floral attractant, benzylacetone. By silencing benzylacetone biosynthesis and nectar production in all combinations by RNAi, we experimentally uncouple these floral rewards/attractrants and measure their costs/benefits in the plant's native habitat and experimental tents. Both scent and nectar increase outcrossing rates for three, separately tested, pollinators and both traits increase oviposition by a hawkmoth herbivore, with nectar being more influential than scent. These results underscore that it makes little sense to study floral traits as if they only mediated pollination services."

Kessler et al. used a gene-silencing technique called \u2018RNA interference\u2019 to inhibit the production of scent or nectar, either separately or together. When grown in field trials, under conditions that prevent self-fertilization, these tobacco plants are frequently visited by a hummingbird and three species of hawkmoth. All four of these animals pollinate the tobacco plants, but one of the moths also lays eggs that hatch into caterpillars, which damage the plant. Kessler et al. monitored the effects that the loss of scent, nectar or both had on visits by each pollinator and on outcrossing."

Furthermore, while, the hummingbird needs nectar, the <i>H. lineata</i> moth does not; but this moth won't visit flowers that lack both scent and nectar. The experiments also show that, for the moth that lays its eggs on the tobacco plants, both scent and nectar increase pollination and egg laying, but nectar has a stronger effect. Thus reducing nectar, as this tobacco plant does in the wild, is one strategy that can be used to reduce herbivore attack by caterpillars. Together, these findings highlight that it is important to study both herbivores and pollinators when attempting to understand the evolution of floral traits."

Even though it is clear that both floral scent and nectar provide fitness benefits for plants, rewardless flowers have evolved in all major groups of angiosperms (<a href=\"#bib63\">Renner, 2006</a>). Orchids, in particular, have frequently evolved deceptive pollination systems, in which flowers attract pollinators by mimicking mating partners or oviposition sites without offering rewards (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schiestl, 2005</a>). But rewardless, nectar-free, flowers are commonly found within species that normally provide nectar, and this is surprising, as the occasional nectar-free flowers would have a disadvantage if visitors have the sensory abilities to avoid rewardless flowers (<a href=\"#bib32\">Karban, 2015</a>). Early on, theorists (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bell, 1986</a>) recognized that most flowers hide their rewards, for example, deep in the corolla tube, which thwarts the easy visual evaluation of a flower's standing nectar volume and developed an ESS model for the proportion of cheating flowers and discriminating visitors that would be evolutionarily stable. Researchers have since uncovered evidence consistent with the predictions of the model. <a href=\"#bib21\">Gilbert et al. (1991)</a> found that nectar secretion was highly variable within plants of a population and suggested that floral visitors could distinguish between low and high nectar secreting plants. Recent research suggests that hawkmoth pollinators can use humidity as a proxy for the presence of nectar (<a href=\"#bib84\">von Arx et al., 2012</a>)."

The effect of floral scent on the pollination success of single pollinator species has been studied mainly with scent augmentations and additions to existing scent bouquets (e.g., <a href=\"#bib45\">Majetic et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Shuttleworth and Johnson, 2010</a>). <a href=\"#bib74\">Shuttleworth and Johnson (2010)</a>, for example, showed that single sulphur compounds are responsible for the shift between wasp and fly pollination in <i>Eucomis</i> (Hyacinthaceae). <a href=\"#bib12\">Byers et al.

Different approaches were used in the field and laboratory to study pollination and herbivory. At our field site at the Lytle Ranch Preserve in SW Utah, we conducted common garden experiments using plants silenced by RNAi in the production of floral scent (CHAL; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kessler et al., 2008</a>), floral nectar (SWEET9; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lin et al., 2014</a>), or both (CHALxSWEET9), in comparison to empty vector-transformed control plants (EV). The RNAi constructs silenced only the targeted pathways and were otherwise isogenic, and the transformed plants were morphologically indistinguishable from EV transformed and wild-type (WT) plants. This approach allowed for the study of the entire panoply of interactions simultaneously, including different floral visitors, and herbivores to gain an unbiased picture of the interactions of individual players in the complex web of interactions that occur when flowers advertise for pollinator services."

These lines (83 and 84) were inbred for two generations and plants of the T<sub>2</sub> generations of both lines also did not produce any nectar in any flowers at all stages of development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), demonstrating that the lack of nectar production was heritable.

While floral scent is an essential floral cue for <i>M. sexta,</i> it is clearly not for <i>H. lineata.</i> While nectar is essential for pollination by <i>A. alexandri</i>, the lack of nectar does not reduce the pollination services provided by <i>H. lineata</i> visitations. Though more generalist pollinators such as <i>H. lineata</i> seem to pollinate even when scent or nectar is missing, they strongly reject plants which are unable to produce both floral traits. However, for the more specialized pollinator, <i>M. sexta,</i> both floral scent attraction and nectar reward are important to maximize outcrossing. Although all lines lacking a certain floral trait showed reduced seed set, plants unable to produce nectar still produced more than twice as many seeds than plants unable to produce floral scent. Again, we found a stronger negative effect in plants unable to produce both traits. In contrast, <i>A. alexandri</i>, the only daytime visitor, rejected plants which did not produce nectar, but surprisingly was also less attracted to plants unable to produce floral scent, although visiting flowers at times when BA is not emitted. One explanation for this could be the accumulation of floral scent in nectar (<a href=\"#bib59\">Raguso, 2004</a>), which could influence the taste of the nectar for these pollinators (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kessler and Baldwin, 2007</a>). Another hypothesis could be that hummingbirds also use olfaction and are able to use nectar scent to locate a proper nectar source. Birds, long suspected to use scent in homing and navigation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Keeton, 1974</a>) have recently been suggested to use scent for prey localization (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mantyla et al., 2008</a>)."

The inferences we can draw about learning in moths from our results are limited. The pollination assays were conducted with naive moths that lacked experience with rewardless and scentless <i>N. attenuata</i> plants.

Our experiments did not directly measure the behavior of the floral visitors and data on the variance in seed set resulting from pollinator visitations, limits the inferences we can draw about pollinator behavior.

Given that <i>N. attenuata</i> seeds can spend hundreds of years in the seed bank before germinating (<a href=\"#bib57\">Preston and Baldwin, 1999</a>), outcrossing will likely be associated with longevity in the seedbank.

To answer this question, the number of flowers was reduced to the same number on all plants on a given day and oviposited eggs were counted the following morning. In the field, all lines lacking a certain floral trait had reduced loads of eggs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>; <i>Friedman</i> signed rank test \u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 11.15, df = 3, n = 4, p = 0.0109). On CHAL plants, only 43.1% (p = 0.046) of the eggs found on EV plants were oviposited. The effect was even stronger in plants unable to produce nectar (SWEET9, 10.8%; CHALxSWEET9, 6.5%, p = 0.046). Comparable results were obtained in a similar experiment, conducted in the tent with single moths, (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>; \u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 13.73, df = 3, n = 11, p = 0.0033). CHAL plants received only 81.9% (p = 0.096) of the eggs of EV plants, while SWEET9 received 52.5% (p = 0.058) and CHALxSWEET9 received 48.4% (p = 0.007) of eggs compared with EV. To control for any other leaf-based influences on oviposition, we conducted control experiments with plants without flowers, by using non-flowering plants or plants from which flowers had been removed before the experiment. In the non-flowering stage, no differences in oviposition were found between the different lines (<i>Friedman</i> signed rank test \u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 2.81, df = 3, n = 6, p = 0.4214). In the field, oviposition rates (over eight experimental days) were too low for statistical analyses, when plants did not flower. Although, plants unable to produce floral scent had a significantly lower chance of receiving an egg from <i>M. sexta</i>, nectar seems to play a larger role in host choice. In contrast to the pollination results, we found no elevated effect in the CHALxSWEET9 cross compared to the single silenced line, which is consistent with the strong effect of nectar alone. The fact that plants lacking floral scent have reduced ovipositions as well as reduced seed set is probably due to the difficulties hawkmoths have in locating scentless <i>N. attenuata</i> flowers (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kessler et al., 2008</a>)."

Of course our conclusions are context dependent, depending on the frequency of low-nectar or low-scented plants in a native population. Clearly, there needs to be an attractive component (e.g., floral scent) coupled with the nectar reward to allow moths to associate food sources with certain floral signals (<a href=\"#bib16\">Daly and Smith, 2000</a>) or oviposition sites. Similarly, moths would learn to avoid floral advertisements if they are not associated with a reward (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haber, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Smithson, 2001</a>). In an evolutionary context, our findings suggest that for an interaction with <i>M. sexta</i>, <i>N. attenuata</i> plants should minimize their nectar accumulation while maximizing their floral scent emission in order to maximize fitness. Indeed <i>N. attenuata</i> produces tiny amounts of nectar in comparison to other sympatric plant species that compete for <i>M. sexta's</i> pollination services (<a href=\"#bib60\">Raguso et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Riffell et al., 2008</a>), and thus seems to have optimized the attractant\u2013reward proportions to maximize its fitness when dealing with this pollinator which is also an herbivore, albeit at a different life stage. <i>D. wrightii</i>, for example, a plant which shares <i>M. sexta</i> as both pollinator and herbivore, is a perennial plant that accumulates 20 times more nectar, produces a large amount of foliage that allows it to better compensate for losses to herbivores, and recruits fewer pollinating species than does <i>N. attenuata</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kessler, 2012</a>)."

In the absence of <i>M. sexta</i>, species such as hummingbirds which only pollinate plants capable of producing nectar, and probably will also only continue to pollinate if a sufficient quantity of nectar is available, are important pollen vectors. <i>H. lineata</i> also provides adequate pollination services, but without apparent evolutionary pressure on these <i>N. attenuata</i> floral traits, as this species seems to require neither an attractive signal nor a reward, at least if these plants are surrounded by other nectar and scent producing plants. Moreover <i>H. lineata</i> is also not an herbivore on <i>N. attenuata</i> during its larval stage. These two sphingid species show dramatic differences in their responses to both floral traits. Only <i>M. sexta</i> seems to rely on the cues provided by the flower and distinguishes between honest and cheating plants in a mixed <i>N. attenuata</i> population. For <i>H. lineata</i>, either floral scent or nectar is sufficient for the moth to provide full pollination services. In bee pollinated <i>Brassica rapa</i> plants, the honesty of a floral signal\u2014that a certain scent would consistently lead to a reward\u2014plays a key role in the plants attractiveness to pollinators (<a href=\"#bib41\">Knauer and Schiestl, 2015</a>), something which seems not to be the case for <i>N. attenuata</i> and its pollinators, as we found no association between BA emission and nectar volume, or nectar sugar concentration. Our data are consistent with a trade-off between rewarding pollinators and avoiding herbivores in the evolution of floral nectar in <i>N. attenuata</i>, but why is BA emission so variable? Since antagonists also use floral scent to locate host plants, increasing floral scent emissions would not only increased <i>M. sexta</i> pollination but could also incur costs by possibly increasing florivory or nectar robbing. Carpenter bees, for example, tend to rob more <i>N. attenuata</i> flowers on plants that emit BA than from plants that do not (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kessler et al., 2008</a>) and experimentally enhancing BA emissions increased rates of browsing (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baldwin et al., 1997</a>)."

We had expected that these different visiting times would blur the differences in the seed set amongst the lines differing in scent and nectar production when plants were exposed to the entire community of floral visitors at the field station, but the results were just the opposite. The differences between EV plants and SWEET9 as well as CHAL plants were maximized when plants were exposed to the entire community of pollinators at once, suggesting that the behavioral responses of each different pollinator to a given floral trait reinforce each other in ways that can only be understood through more detailed behavioral observations. <i>N. attenuata</i> flowers secrete nectar slowly over the night until approximately 4 am (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kessler, 2012</a>), theoretically keeping a low but constant amount of nectar over the entire night, even if floral visitors removed the majority of nectar in the dusk or in the first half of the night. Unfortunately, we do not know if nectar secretion patterns change after flowers have been visited and nectar has been removed, but from nectar measurements, we know that flowers visited by <i>M. sexta</i> (which invariably removes the standing volume of nectar) again contain a residual amount of nectar in the morning. Similar questions remain about the costs associated with the production of nectar. One would expect that nectaring hummingbirds or white-lined sphinx moths in the dusk could influence <i>M. sexta</i> oviposition by removing all the nectar in the 2 h before <i>M. sexta</i> becomes active. Clearly, there remains a large gap between our understanding of how particular flower traits influence the behavior of the flower visitors and the pollination services that they provide."

For example, in the <i>Silene latifolia\u2013Hadena bicruris</i> nursery pollination system, male moths provide a fitness benefit for the plant, while interactions with females come with the substantial costs of seed-feeding caterpillars (<a href=\"#bib43\">Labouche and Bernasconi, 2009</a>). The highly specialized <i>Yucca-Tegiticula</i> pollination/seed predation system would be another example. Plants rarely interact with just one partner and usually face multiple selection pressures from mutualists and antagonists at the same time, which may shape the different floral traits of a plant. In most cases, there will be less and more effective pollinators (<a href=\"#bib14\">Conner et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barthelmess et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Matsuki et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Miller et al., 2014</a>), as well as herbivores which are attracted by floral signals such as scent or nectar (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adler and Bronstein, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Theis, 2006</a>). Even purely mutualistic interactions like those known from bee pollination systems, probably evolved in the context of avoiding herbivory and excluding less efficient pollinators at the same time. Pollinator networks are known to be highly flexible and change frequently over time within a season (<a href=\"#bib52\">Olesen et al., 2008</a>), as well as between years (<a href=\"#bib53\">Olesen et al., 2011</a>) and this flexibility likely explains why plants recruit additional pollinator species rather than specialize if they rely on outcrossing. Most pollinator networks are nested (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pawar, 2014</a>) and this nestedness is thought to stabilize mutualistic networks (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rohr et al., 2014</a>), reducing interspecific competition and enhancing the number of coexisting species (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bastolla et al., 2009</a>), with the end result of increasing the coexistence of several pollinating species on a plant. The high temporal plasticity in species composition coupled with the low variation in network structure properties in pollination networks makes such a scenario likely (<a href=\"#bib55\">Petanidou et al., 2008</a>)."

They have to ensure outcrossing by an unpredictable number of pollinating species and individuals, all of which have different preferences and behaviors, and at the same time need to keep herbivores at bay. Here, we demonstrate that nectar-free, pollinator cheating, varieties of <i>N. attenuata</i> occur in nature, and that producing no nectar can substantially reduce ovipositions by <i>M. sexta</i>, but that this comes with a reduction in pollination services. While cheating on the nectar rewards works for one pollinator species, it does not for others. In contrast, cheating with regards to the attractant floral scent has little influence on <i>M. sexta</i> oviposition, but dramatically reduces outcrossing by <i>M. sexta</i>. All three examined pollinators show different responses to nectar and scent and thus the interactions of multiple species are likely responsible for fine-tuning the evolution of both nectar and floral scent, as both <i>H. lineata</i>, as well as <i>A. alexandri</i> are important pollen vectors in the absence of <i>M. sexta</i>. Both traits in combination are required to maximize maternal fitness in nature particularly in ensuring <i>M. sexta</i> visitations, which we hypothesize delivers the greatest diversity of pollen genotypes compared to <i>H. lineata</i> and <i>A. alexandri</i>. Hence, the close association between <i>N. attenuata</i> and <i>M. sexta</i> may result from <i>M. sexta's</i> ability to move pollen over longer distances than the other pollinators, and thus provide superior outcrossing services among <i>N. attenuata</i> populations which are frequently isolated by the large distances that frequently occur between fires, and hence <i>N. attenuata</i> populations. The long time between fires at any particular location may place a premium on outcrossing rates, as heterozygosity may increase herbivore resistance in future generations (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mescher et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bello-Bedoy and Nunez-Farfan, 2011</a>), as well as longevity in the seedbank. We conclude that herbivores, as well as pollinators shape the evolution of floral traits and that it makes little sense to study floral traits as if they only mediate pollination services."

No phenological differences, such as plant shape, size, or flower size among these four lines, would suggest a lack of fitness benefit for plants producing no nectar or no scent. In the case of the hemizygous cross between CHAL and SWEET9 (CHALxSWEET9), we observed that occasionally plants started to secrete nectar in late developmental stages.

Flower number of all plants was reduced to five newly opening flowers every afternoon so as to standardize the apparency of each plant's inflorescence to the moths. Each morning, eggs were counted and removed from the plants. The collected eggs, as well as eggs collected from <i>D. wrightii</i> plants at this time of the season were used to rear moths for experiments in the tent. All caterpillars which hatched from these eggs proved to be <i>M. sexta</i>, which suggests that <i>M. sexta</i> accounts for all the oviposition data in our experiments, and not <i>M. quinquemaculata</i>, a closely related species which shares host plants with <i>M. sexta</i> in both the larval and the adult stages. Of the nine experimental days, <i>M. sexta</i> moths oviposited on only four of these days. In the tent experiments, unlike in the pollination trials, no WT pollen donor plants were necessary, which allowed for a larger number of experimental plants in the tent at a time. 10 plants per transformed line were randomly arranged in the tent with a distance of 2 m between plants. Plants were exchanged and rearranged daily, and a freshly mated female <i>M. sexta</i> moth was released into the tent on each day."

In all cases, the day did not influence the line effect significantly as revealed by a one-way ANOVA p &gt; 0.05. Therefore, each plant was used as a replicate and the average seed number produced from the five flowers on a plant was used for statistical analyses. For oviposition data, days were used as replicates and average values of the different lines were compared. Significant differences for all pollination, oviposition, as well as phenotyping data (nectar volume and floral volatile emissions) data were calculated using a <i>Friedman</i> signed rank test which was performed in R2.11.1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crawley, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">R Development Core Team, 2007</a>).

The approach chosen is clearly excellent, and the results are very interesting. The study shows that it is not necessarily possible to predict the impact of the total pollinator community from studying individual pollinators. From the results with <i>H. lineata</i>, <i>M sexta</i> and the hummingbird one should expect it would be ideal for the plants to become scentless, as only <i>M. sexta</i> was strongly affected by scentless flowers, and this pollinator is also the specialised herbivore, which the plant may want to avoid anyway. For the whole community, however, reduced scent resulted in strongly reduced seed set. A weakness of the study is that final fitness outcomes of herbivory were not estimated, as herbivory on fruits and seeds was not investigated. A recent study in Brassica has shown that specialised herbivores do not necessarily feed on seeds (Lucas-Barbosa et al. 2013). Also, it should be outlined that the results found are quite specific for systems were pollinators are at the same time herbivores, and may not be broadly applicable to other pollination system such as bee pollination. This point should be made clear at some point in the paper. There are also a lot of errs and other problems in the manuscript as outlined below. The Result and Discussion section is broadly mixed with text belonging to the Materials and Methods section. The Introduction has a slightly arrogant tone at some places, sounding as if most previous studies investigating similar topics were inferior to this study, this is inappropriate given the fact that each study, including the one by the authors, has its strengths and weaknesses."

The authors suggest that the tradeoff between sufficient pollinator services and herbivore avoidance might be managed by variation in floral scent and nectar, and then survey geographic / population level variation in these traits by growing seeds from different lines in a common garden, demonstrating log normal variation in benzyl acetone (the primary chemical pollinator attractant) and nectar (the primary reward) in nature. Then, they combine RNAi lines that silence benzyl acetone production, nectar production, or both and measure the reproductive consequences in arrays of antherectomized plants (which cannot self-pollinate) in field and flight cage experiments."

I have several questions about methods and presentation which can easily be dealt with by the authors. My other points are primarily requests that they modify some of their statements about prior studies on floral cheating. Again, I think these are easily dealt with, but I would like to see less dismissiveness in the authors' tone \u2013 empty flowers are a very old idea in pollination biology, and there is a large body of theoretical and experimental work on floral enemies shaping floral ecology and evolution. The beauty of this study, as in previous studies by these authors, is in its surgical manipulation of the traits in question and the inclusion of several floral visitors, some detrimental, in the design, with real fitness consequences as the response variables."

The pollinator function of the plant\u2019s interaction with this species is mediated by two relatively simple traits, BA and nectar, and the relationship is based on changing the apparency of the flower and providing a reward for a particular behavior. With regard to the plant\u2019s interaction with the herbivore, the plant has a 5 layered suite of defense/tolerance/avoidance responses that are all elicited by <i>M. sexta</i> larvae elicitors, which all kick into gear when the egg hatches to produce a larva. The defense responses include indirect defenses, which like the pollinator interaction involve changing the apparency of the plant, albeit to predators of the herbivores. Previous work (Allmann and Baldwin 2010) demonstrated that some of the VOCs that mediate these indirect defenses also influence <i>Manduca</i>\u2019s oviposition decisions. We have not added this point to the text as it would take a couple of paragraphs (and many citations) to flesh out this idea in a cogent manner, but we would be happy to do so if you think that it\u2019s an important point to address.

If nectar or scent production represented a physiological drag for the plant, we would expect early flowering from the rewardless plants, but the entire phenology of the plants is completely comparable across all four lines. We added a sentence to the Methods section describing this. The only thing we did not test was the production of flowers over the entire life time of a plant. This is something we have to address in future studies. In the experiments presented in this manuscript, plants were always reduced to the same number of flowers, so that all replicates would have the same visual \u201cfloral apparency\u201d."

I have several questions about methods and presentation which can easily be dealt with by the authors.
