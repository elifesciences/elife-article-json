We report that delamanid (OPC-67683), an approved drug for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, is a potent inhibitor of <i>Leishmania donovani</i> both in vitro and in vivo. Twice-daily oral dosing of delamanid at 30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for 5 days resulted in sterile cures in a mouse model of VL. Treatment with lower doses revealed a U-shaped (hormetic) dose-response curve with greater parasite suppression at 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> than at 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (5 or 10 day dosing). Dosing delamanid for 10 days confirmed the hormetic dose-response and improved the efficacy at all doses investigated. Mechanistic studies reveal that delamanid is rapidly metabolised by parasites via an enzyme, distinct from the nitroreductase that activates fexinidazole. Delamanid has the potential to be repurposed as a much-needed oral therapy for VL."

We report that delamanid (OPC-67683), an approved drug for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, is a potent inhibitor of <i>Leishmania donovani</i> both in vitro and in vivo. Twice-daily oral dosing of delamanid at 30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for 5 days resulted in sterile cures in a mouse model of VL. Treatment with lower doses revealed a U-shaped (hormetic) dose-response curve with greater parasite suppression at 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> than at 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (5 or 10 day dosing). Dosing delamanid for 10 days confirmed the hormetic dose-response and improved the efficacy at all doses investigated. Mechanistic studies reveal that delamanid is rapidly metabolised by parasites via an enzyme, distinct from the nitroreductase that activates fexinidazole. Delamanid has the potential to be repurposed as a much-needed oral therapy for VL."

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a neglected tropical disease resulting from infection with the protozoan parasites <i>Leishmania donovani</i> or <i>L. infantum</i> is a case in point, with the two anti-leishmanial front-line therapies miltefosine and amphotericin B both originally developed for other indications (<a href=\"#bib40\">Stuart et al., 2008</a>). In addition, the anti-trypanosomal clinical candidate fexinidazole was recently discovered to have potent activity in a murine VL model (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wyllie et al., 2012</a>), resulting in a phase II proof of concept clinical trial (NCT01980199) against VL being conducted in Sudan."

VL is fatal if untreated and, in the absence of effective vaccines and vector control methods, efficacious chemotherapy is required to combat the disease. Each of the currently available drugs has one or more drawbacks, including the need for hospitalization, prolonged therapy, parenteral administration, high cost, variable efficacy, severe toxic side-effects and resistance (<a href=\"#bib12\">Croft et al., 2006</a>).

On day 14 post-infection, the parasite burdens in the livers of infected mice were determined and compared with those of control animals. The only current oral anti-leishmanial therapy miltefosine (30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, once-daily, 5 days) was included as a positive control. Both delamanid and miltefosine were well tolerated at these doses, with no mice displaying any overt signs of toxicity. An initial experiment showed that treatment with delamanid at 50 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> effectively cured the study mice, with no detectable parasites in the liver smears, whereas control mice dosed with vehicle alone showed a high level of infection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). A second in vivo study with mice dosed twice-daily at 30, 10 or 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> suppressed infection in the murine model by 99.5%, 63.5% and 16.0%, respectively, establishing a dose-dependent anti-leishmanial effect within the range of 3\u201350 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>.

By measuring the change in drug concentration over time in <i>L. donovani</i>-infected mice, two standard PK parameters can be obtained: maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) in blood; and the area under the curve (AUC), a measure of total drug exposure over time. The drug concentration over time is measured in order to determine whether the concentration of a drug exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, EC<sub>90</sub> in this case) and, if so, for how long (time over MIC, T<sub>&gt;MIC</sub>). Parameters such as C<sub>max</sub>/MIC, AUC/MIC and T<sub>&gt;MIC</sub> are important for achieving drug efficacy in an in vivo model of disease. Both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC measure the total drug level in blood or plasma; however, only unbound drug molecules are able to bind to their targets (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bohnert and Gan, 2013</a>). Therefore, the plasma protein binding level (expressed as the fraction unbound, Fu) of delamanid was also measured and used to calculate an adjusted EC<sub>90</sub> (assay EC<sub>90\u00a0</sub>\u00d7 1/Fu) for comparison with blood concentration over time."

Data for the first and ninth dose in a 5-day twice daily treatment experiment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) show a dose-dependent response with accumulation over time. A similar effect was noted in a 10-day study (1<sup>st</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> dose; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). More detailed analysis of the combined PK data from five experiments (including two 10-day treatment studies) shows a linear relationship between doses of 0.3\u201310 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and peak blood concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) or area under the curve (AUC<sub>(0-t)</sub>) with accumulation from day 1 through to day 10 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>).

In <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, delamanid is assumed to be reductively activated by the same unusual deazaflavin (F420)-dependent nitroreductase (Ddn) known to activate the closely related nitroimidazo-oxazine drug PA-824 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Manjunatha et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Singh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Manjunatha et al., 2009</a>). In the absence of a Ddn homologue in <i>Leishmania</i>, we assessed whether the reduction of delamanid is catalysed by the NADH-dependent bacterial-like nitroreductase (NTR) already shown to activate the nitroimidazoles fexinidazole and nifurtimox in these parasites (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wyllie et al., 2012</a>). The potency of delamanid was determined against parasites overexpressing NTR. Increased concentrations of NTR in these transgenic parasites were confirmed by a 13-fold increase in their sensitivity to nifurtimox (EC<sub>50</sub> of 8.0 \u00b1 0.2 and 0.61 \u00b1 0.006\u2009\u03bcM for WT and transgenic parasites, respectively <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), known to undergo two-electron reduction by NTR (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hall et al., 2011</a>). However, overexpression of NTR in promastigotes did not significantly alter their sensitivity to delamanid (EC<sub>50</sub> of 4.5 \u00b1 0.004 and 4.1 \u00b1 0.003 nM for WT and transgenic parasites, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To confirm that the same was also true in the amastigote stage of these parasites, metacyclic promastigotes overexpressing NTR were used to infect mouse peritoneal macrophages. The resulting intracellular parasites were found to be just as sensitive to delamanid as WT parasites with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 57.8 \u00b1 2.1 and 55.2 \u00b1 4.3 nM, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These findings indicate that NTR does not play a role in the activation of delamanid in <i>L. donovani</i> in either stage of the life cycle and that the mechanism of action of this nitroheterocyclic drug is different from that of fexinidazole."

To address this issue, the concentration of delamanid was determined by UPLC-MS/MS in cultures of promastigotes over a 24\u2009hr period. Delamanid is known to be primarily metabolised in plasma by albumin (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shimokawa et al., 2015</a>) and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sasahara et al., 2015</a>). Thus, the concentration of delamanid in culture medium without parasites was measured over the same time period as a control. In the presence of medium alone, delamanid decreased linearly in a concentration-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, in the presence of <i>L. donovani</i> promastigotes the rate of disappearance of delamanid was markedly increased, such that the drug had essentially disappeared by 6\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The net amount of delamanid metabolised by parasites as a function of time is also linear and dependent on the initial concentration in the medium (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Linear regression of these data revealed that the rate of cell metabolism is not saturated up to the top concentration tested (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Analogous experiments using mouse peritoneal macrophages and THP-1 monocytes found no evidence of delamanid metabolism by these host cell lines. Elucidation of the chemical identity of the delamanid metabolite(s), their possible role in parasite killing and the enzyme(s) responsible for their biosynthesis will be the focus of future studies."

Similarly, the <i>R</i>-enantiomer of an analogue of delamanid has been shown to be more potent against <i>M. tuberculosis</i> than its corresponding <i>S</i>-enantiomer (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sasaki et al., 2006</a>). However, this contrasts with the closely related nitroimidazole PA-824, where the enantiomeric specificity for <i>L. donovani</i> and <i>M. tuberculosis</i> is opposite (<a href=\"#bib30\">Patterson et al., 2013</a>). Delamanid is rapidly leishmanicidal with a cell-density dependent potency and as expected, demonstrated no observable toxicity in a mammalian cell assay. The observed shift in drug sensitivity with increasing serum concentration is likely due to increased metabolism by albumin to inactive metabolites, rather than changes in free drug concentration due to protein binding."

Based on the in vitro intra\u2013macrophage amastigote EC<sub>90</sub> value (120 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>), the high PPB of delamanid (F<sub>u</sub> 0.0045) results in an adjusted intra macrophage <i>L. donovani</i> EC<sub>90</sub> of 26,700 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>,\u00a0a concentration that is not achieved in whole blood at any point in the efficacy study. Therefore, the efficacy of delamanid in the VL animal model is unexpected. However, there are exceptions to the free drug theory, such as drugs that form active metabolites resulting in inactivation (covalent or otherwise) of multiple targets (<a href=\"#bib38\">Smith et al., 2010</a>).

This U-shaped dose-response curve is reminiscent of hormesis in toxicology (<a href=\"#bib9\">Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">2002</a>), but, to our knowledge, is unprecedented in microbiology. This effect is not observed in dose response curves in vitro, so must be related to a physiological or metabolic threshold response in the infected drug-treated animal. In vivo delamanid is proposed to undergo primary metabolism with loss of the nitro group, mainly catalysed by albumin (<a href=\"#bib10\">Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Shimokawa et al., 2015</a>). Further metabolism to seven other metabolites is thought to occur via hydrolysis reactions and oxidation by CYP3A4 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sasahara et al., 2015</a>). The cause of this U-shaped dose-response curve is currently not known. One possibility is that a drug metabolite of delamanid antagonises the bio-activation of delamanid, or antagonises the downstream effects in the leishmania parasite. The formation of a putative antagonist metabolite would have to show a saturable sigmoidal dose response, such that at higher concentrations, delamanid, or an active parasite-specific metabolite thereof, are able to displace the antagonist from the bio-activating enzyme, or proteins related to the downstream effect respectively. It should be noted that in the same VL animal model the related nitroimidazole (<i>S</i>)-PA-824 was also more efficacious at a lower dose (30 vs 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Patterson et al., 2013</a>). Further studies with (<i>S</i>)-PA-824 should be conducted to determine if this compound also displays a hormetic PK/PD relationship and establish if this is a chemotype-related characteristic."

The studies presented herein are consistent with delamanid also being activated by a parasite-specific enzyme absent from host cells.

Delamanid can be administered orally, an important requirement for patients who have limited access to even the most basic of health care facilities, whereas liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) has to be administered intravenously and requires cold storage for stability. Perhaps the most challenging issue may be cost of goods. Assuming an efficacious dose of 100 mg once-daily for in excess of 10 days and the market cost of delamanid in developed countries (US$42 per 50 mg tablet) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lessem, 2014</a>), the predicted cost per patient would be over US$840, significantly higher than that specified in the VL TPP (<us$10 (<a=\"\" <$80=\"\" and=\"\" be=\"\" course)=\"\" current=\"\" expensive=\"\" href=\"#bib26\" more=\"\" or=\"\" other=\"\" per=\"\" predicted=\"\" strategies=\"\" than=\"\" to=\"\" treatment=\"\">Meheus et al., 2010</us$10>).

The authors have reported on analogs of this class of molecule before, with the rather disappointing finding that the other TB drug candidate in this class (PA-824) had only moderate activity. PA-824 is a chiral molecule with an S configuration on the oxazine ring; the surprising finding was that the opposite stereoisomer (which is not being developed for clinical use) was considerably more active. Additional screening revealed another molecule with similar stereospecificity that was similar to delamanid and the crucial insight in this work was that delamanid, (R)-PA-824, and the screening hit all presented similar stereochemical configurations suggesting delamanid might be potent against VL."

A major concern is the difference in the microbiome between a patient in India, Africa, and Europe. One cannot assume that the absence of an enzyme like a nitroreductase in one microbiome means it will be absent in all. Again this is not a criticism of the current manuscript, but at least a warning or recognition of this potential issue should be stated in the Discussion."

It seems at least plausible that the antagonistic metabolite is the molecule referred to as M1 in those publications which is formed by cleavage of the nitroimidazooxazole. They describe a simple looking procedure for producing M1 from human serum albumin that might allow the authors to more definitively address the plausibility of this pharmacodynamic mechanism."
