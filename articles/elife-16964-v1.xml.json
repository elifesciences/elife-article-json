Over this span of time, G\u03b2\u03b3 regulation of ion channel activity has spawned a field densely populated with neurobiologists and electrophysiologists, with GIRKs being a major focus because of their physiological importance, phenomenological richness, experimental tractability and linkage to human diseases."

Most GIRK channels contain four sub-units: those found in cardiac pacemaker cells contain either four GIRK4 sub-units, or two GIRK1 sub-units and two GIRK4 sub-units, and channels containing four GIRK2 sub-units are found in neurons. The G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit is also molecularly diverse, with at least 5 \u03b2 and 13 \u03b3 isoforms known. What strikes me as truly remarkable for such intensely studied channels is that the energetics of GIRK activation by G\u03b2\u03b3 has remained almost entirely unknown."

What sort of crosstalk operates between G\u03b2\u03b3 and other GIRK activators, such as the phosphoinositides that reside in the cell membrane or the sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) found in the cytoplasm? How much G\u03b2\u03b3 is released into the cell membrane in a synaptic response? Why are certain GIRKs modulated by Na<sup>+</sup> and others not? Such questions had not been answered previously, and those few that were posed at all produced soft or discordant conclusions.

First, the channels open only when all four sites are occupied by G\u03b2\u03b3, which binds with \"positive cooperativity\" such that the affinity of the fourth ligand is higher than the affinity of the first by a factor of ~40. These features are functional manifestations of what we know about the structure of the GIRK2\u2013G\u03b2\u03b3 complex from X-ray diffraction studies (the G\u03b2\u03b3-binding surface becomes more exposed as the channel opens; <a href=\"#bib8\">Whorton et al., 2013</a>), and they ensure that the channel opens in a switch-like manner as the cellular stimulus is increased. Second, although it is specific, G\u03b2\u03b3 binding is also quite weak, so the channels are poised to close swiftly after removal of the stimulus. Third, Na<sup>+</sup> in the physiological range boosts G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity to GIRK2 or GIRK4 channels: this allows the GIRK channels to increase their activity when floods of Na<sup>+</sup> ions enter neurons during high-frequency bursts of excitation."

The Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site in the GIRK4 subunit contains an aspartic acid (Asp) residue, but there is an asparagine (Asn) residue at the same site in the GIRK1 subunit (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999</a>). Na<sup>+</sup> binding increases G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity in GIRK4 channels, and therefore increases responsiveness to stimulation of the G protein. Touhara et al. find that GIRK1/4 channels behave as if permanently in a high-Na<sup>+</sup> state, even when the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> is zero, as though the Asn residue of GIRK1 mimics the electrically neutral Asp-Na<sup>+</sup> configuration of the GIRK4 channel at high levels of Na<sup>+</sup>. Touhara et al. confirm that GIRK currents in cardiac cell lines are Na<sup>+</sup>-insensitive, implying that most of the GIRK4 in these cells is tied up with GIRK1 in GIRK1/4 channels.\u00a0Finally, this new understanding of Na<sup>+</sup> modulation reported in the first paper (<a href=\"#bib5\">Touhara et al., 2016</a>) was cleverly exploited in the second paper (<a href=\"#bib6\">Wang et al., 2016</a>) to estimate the absolute surface density of G\u03b2\u03b3 in dopamine neurons at the peak of a physiological GIRK response: about 1 subunit per 10,000 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>."
