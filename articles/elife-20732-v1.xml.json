                    "text": "Friedreich\u2019s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in <i>Frataxin</i> (<i>FXN</i>). Loss of <i>FXN</i> causes impaired mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis. An elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was previously proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of FRDA. We recently showed that loss of <i>frataxin homolog</i> (<i>fh</i>), a <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of <i>FXN</i>, causes a ROS independent neurodegeneration in flies (Chen et al., 2016). In <i>fh</i> mutants, iron accumulation in the nervous system enhances the synthesis of sphingolipids, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) to trigger neurodegeneration of adult photoreceptors. Here, we show that loss of <i>Fxn</i> in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating that the mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels and PDK1 activity are also increased in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that a similar pathway is affected in FRDA."

Loss of <i>FXN</i> causes impaired mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis. An elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was previously proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of FRDA. We recently showed that loss of <i>frataxin homolog</i> (<i>fh</i>), a <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of <i>FXN</i>, causes a ROS independent neurodegeneration in flies (Chen et al., 2016). In <i>fh</i> mutants, iron accumulation in the nervous system enhances the synthesis of sphingolipids, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) to trigger neurodegeneration of adult photoreceptors. Here, we show that loss of <i>Fxn</i> in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating that the mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels and PDK1 activity are also increased in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that a similar pathway is affected in FRDA."

Patients with FRDA exhibit a progressive degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia, sensory peripheral nerves, and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. Most individuals develop several neurological symptoms at a juvenile age, but individuals with adult or late onset are occasionally reported (<a href=\"#bib18\">Koeppen, 2011</a>). Mutations in <i>FXN</i> were discovered as the primary cause of FRDA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Campuzano et al., 1996</a>). Studies of the <i>yeast frataxin homolog</i> identified a role for <i>FXN</i> in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and iron homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Babcock et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">R\u00f6tig et al., 1997</a>). Loss of <i>FXN</i> has been shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in several model organisms (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anderson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Puccio et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">R\u00f6tig et al., 1997</a>). Yet, whether iron accumulates in the nervous system is still under debate, as it has been reported that iron levels are not altered in the nervous system of a conditional knockout mouse model and in FRDA patients (<a href=\"#bib28\">Puccio et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Simon et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Solbach et al., 2014</a>). However, in FRDA patients, iron was shown to accumulate in the dentate nuclei or in glia cells of dorsal root ganglia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boddaert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Koeppen et al., 2009</a>). In sum, the iron deposition phenotype is still controversial in mouse models and FRDA patients, and the role of iron in the pathophysiology of FRDA has not yet been determined."

However, emerging evidence suggests that ROS are not elevated in several model organisms, and several clinical trials based on antioxidant therapy have shown no or limited benefit in FRDA patients (<a href=\"#bib7\">Babcock et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Llorens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Macevilly and Muller, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Santhera Pharmaceuticals, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Seznec et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shidara and Hollenbeck, 2010</a>).

We showed that loss of <i>fh</i> in <i>Drosophila</i> leads to iron accumulation in the nervous system, which in turn induces sphingolipid synthesis and ectopically activates Pdk1 and Mef2. Mef2 activation triggers the aberrant transcription of downstream target genes that causes the degeneration of fly photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2016</a>). However, whether this pathway is also affected in vertebrates upon loss of <i>FXN</i> is unknown. Here, we removed the endogenous mouse <i>Fxn</i> gene by using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) and CRISPR/Cas9 strategy (<a href=\"#bib36\">Swiech et al., 2014</a>). We show that the iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway is activated in mice upon loss of <i>Fxn</i>. Furthermore, sphingolipids and PDK1 activity are also up-regulated in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that this pathway is also affected in FRDA. Hence, down-regulation of this pathway provides possible new targets to interfere with disease progression."

We designed two different <i>Fxn</i> single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and tested their efficiency. The <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNAs induce lesions in the <i>Fxn</i> locus and reduce the levels of FXN protein when compared to the <i>LacZ</i>-sgRNA control in Neuro-2a cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). To deliver <i>LacZ</i>- or <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA into the nervous system, we injected AAV that carried sgRNA into the ventricle of Rosa26-Cas9 knock-in newborn mouse brains (<a href=\"#bib26\">Platt et al., 2014</a>), and the efficiency of AAV infection into the cortical neurons was examined. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, the majority of cortical neurons are infected with AAV, and the mRNA levels of <i>Fxn</i> in <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA mice are less than 40% of the <i>LacZ</i>-sgRNA control mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

These include a smaller body size and a hunchback phenotype at P130 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Interestingly, these features are similar to the neuronal conditional knockout mice that were previously reported (<a href=\"#bib28\">Puccio et al., 2001</a>). In addition, the <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA mice become much less mobile than their <i>LacZ</i>-sgRNA littermates (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). The <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA mice also display an aberrant reflex when lifted by the tail as they fail to spread their hind limbs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To evaluate the sensorimotor coordination, we performed a rotarod test at two different ages. At P50, we observe no difference between <i>LacZ</i>-sgRNA and <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA mice. However, <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA mice show a significant reduction of latency to fall from the rod at age of P130 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Besides the deficit on the rotarod test, <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA mice also show a severe impairment in the wire hang test at P130 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In summary, a removal of <i>Fxn</i> in a substantial neuronal population in the newborn mouse brain causes a severe impairment of neuronal function."

To examine Fe<sup>3+</sup> levels, we performed Perls\u2019 staining and used 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) to enhance the signal. At P130 the DAB signal is strongly increased in brain sections of <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA mice when compared to control mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To further characterize the iron distribution, we co-stain iron with neuronal and glia markers in the same brain sections. Since strong DAB signal interferes with the fluorescence, we chose the cortex region with relatively weak DAB deposits of <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA mice. Interestingly, the majority of DAB signals are co-localized with a neuronal marker but not glial markers, suggesting that Fe<sup>3+</sup> accumulates in neurons, although there are some weak diffuse signals distributed outside of the cell body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data show that Fe<sup>3+</sup> accumulates in the nervous system upon loss of <i>Fxn</i>. The fact that we observed an obvious Fe<sup>3+</sup> accumulation, whereas previous reports did not, is likely due to the use of DAB to enhance the Perls' Prussian blue staining, as we did not observe any signal with Perls' Prussian blue staining alone (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

However, we did not observe an increase of 4-HNE in <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA brain tissues (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), consistent with previous observations in flies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2016</a>).

Phosphorylation of S241 in the PDK1 activation loop is required for its activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Casamayor et al., 1999</a>).

Finally, we tested if PDK1 activity is also increased in FRDA patients. The phosphorylation levels of S241 in PDK1 are elevated in FRDA patients when compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Note that patient six showed no obvious increase in PDK1 phosphorylation when compared to the other patients.

The age of death was also much later in patient 6 (age 67) compared to the other patients (age 25\u201337). Similarly, the increased levels of sphingolipids in patient six are also less pronounced than other patients.

For example, DAB staining showed a diffuse pattern in and surrounding the neuronal cell body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and the RPA fluorescence is similarly reduced in the extracellular space (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting that iron accumulation occurs both intracellularly and extracellularly."

Interestingly, genetic variations at the 5\u2019UTR of Mef2C that promote Mef2C transcription are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alonso-Montes et al., 2012</a>). In addition, overexpression of Mef2A or Mef2C causes cell sarcomeric disorganization and elongation in cultured cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Xu et al., 2006</a>). These data suggest that an activation of iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway may play a role in the induction of cardiomyopathy in FRDA patients. Inhibition of this pathway may not only suppress neurodegeneration, but also prevent or delay cardiomyopathy, the major cause of lethality in FRDA. In sum, this pathway may provide us with therapeutic targets based on antisense oligonucleotide strategies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ackermann et al., 2012</a>), an option that should be explored."

In brief, 80\u201390% confluent HEK293T cells in a 15 cm dish were split into 6\u00d715 cm dish one day before transfection. Next day, the media was removed and replaced with 9 ml of fresh DMEM/5% FBS. 24 \u00b5l of iMFectin reagent were diluted to 0.5 ml by DMEM and then added to 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 4 \u00b5g of helper plasmid, 2 \u00b5g of DJ/8 and 2 \u00b5g of transfer vector. The transfection mixture was vortexed for 10 s and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before overlay on HEK293T cells without removing media.

The earlier <i>eLife</i> paper characterized the phenotype caused by loss of function of <i>Drosophila Frataxin</i>. The fly mutant showed iron accumulation in the nervous system and activation of a pathway that involves Pdk1 and Mef2 that triggered degeneration, but contrary to expectations, no evidence of ROS. In the current paper, the authors build upon this story by examining the consequence of FXN loss of function in young mice. They validate a sgRNA from mouse FXN in vitro, then use AAV-mediated intraventricular delivery to P0 Rosa26-Cas9 mice, and this results in knockdown of endogenous FXN as assessed by mRNA levels. At P130 the knockdown mice are small, kyphotic, and perform poorly on hanging wire and rotarod. Histologically, the cortices show upregulation of ATF3 and loss of AnkG, as well as deposition of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>. No elevation of 4-HNE was detected, suggesting no major oxidative stress. Elevated levels of phosphorylated PDK1 and modestly elevated levels of several mRNAs purported to be downstream of Mef2 were detected. Sphingolipid levels in the mice were not examined. Examination of postmortem heart tissue from several FRDA patients showed increased sphingolipid levels and increased levels of phosphorylated PDK1."

The method has been used in several animal models and tissues, including fly (Kosmidis et al., 2012), zebrafish (Lumsden et al., 2007), and mouse (van Duijn et al., 2013). We have validated the sensitivity by comparing the signals with either Perls\u2019 staining alone or Perls\u2019/DAB staining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), and we only observed an obvious increase in signal in the brain sections by using Perls\u2019/DAB staining. The data clearly show that the Perls\u2019/DAB staining is a more sensitive method to detect ferric irons. We described this method in our previous paper as well and show its application in third instar larval brains. Finally, we were not able to obtain the published <i>Fxn</i> conditional knock-out mice produced by Helen Puccio and colleagues after 5 requests and several phone calls.

In addition, the patient heart samples show increased sphingolipids, further supporting our hypothesis. We recently obtained sphingolipid analyses of single <i>LacZ</i>-sgRNA and <i>Fxn</i>-sgRNA mice at P60 after waiting for many months for the results. The levels of several sphingolipid species are indeed increased, consistent with our other data (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1</a>). We did not integrate these data as we feel we need at least 3 samples for a proper analysis. Unfortunately, we currently do not have any mouse brain samples as they were used for all other assays and histochemical stainings. We can re-inject the virus and perform sphingolipid analysis, but it will take at least 5 months to get the data (3 months for mice and 2-3 month for the sphingolipid mass spectrometry). However, given that we already published the pathway in flies and that the hearts of patients show this up-regulation, we feel that we have compelling evidence that this pathway is evolutionarily conserved."

The anti-FXN antibody produced by Helen Puccio was not made available upon repeated requests and the available commercial antibodies only work for immunoblots. There are also no reagents available to examine Mef2 activity by immunostaining. However, we performed experiments with some formerly made brain sections and examined the iron distribution in the <i>Fxn</i>- sgRNA mice.
