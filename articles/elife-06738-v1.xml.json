Here, we combine high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 T with novel data-driven and model-based analyses to identify corresponding subregions in humans based on the well-known global connectivity fingerprints in rodents and sensitivity to spatial and non-spatial information. We provide evidence for a functional division primarily along the anteroposterior axis. Localising the human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC has important implications for translating studies on the hippocampo-entorhinal memory system from rodents to humans."

Here, we combine high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 T with novel data-driven and model-based analyses to identify corresponding subregions in humans based on the well-known global connectivity fingerprints in rodents and sensitivity to spatial and non-spatial information. We provide evidence for a functional division primarily along the anteroposterior axis. Localising the human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC has important implications for translating studies on the hippocampo-entorhinal memory system from rodents to humans."

The MEC receives inputs about spatial information from parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and the LEC receives item-related information from perirhinal cortex (PRC) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Van Strien et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Knierim et al., 2013</a>).

In contrast, cells in the LEC respond to individual objects in the environment rather than to specific locations (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tsao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Knierim et al., 2013</a>)."

This hampers translational studies, which is particularly relevant in the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with AD pathology starting in the EC (<a href=\"#bib4\">Braak and Braak, 1992</a>). Within the EC, the vulnerability to AD-related pathology is not homogeneously distributed and differs between medial and lateral strips in humans, which has been related to similar findings in the rodent MEC and LEC, respectively (<a href=\"#bib28\">Khan et al., 2014</a>). However, the localization of the human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC remains unclear. A source of considerable confusion is the fact that \u2018MEC\u2019 and \u2018LEC\u2019 are referring to cytoarchitectonically defined areas and not to anatomical locations. Hence, they do not circumscribe strips of medial and lateral EC. Rather, the MEC is located medially in the septal (posterior) part of the EC and the LEC is located laterally in the temporal (anterior) part of the EC in rodents (<a href=\"#bib54\">Van Strien et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, tracing studies on PHC and PRC pathways in non-human primates suggest a dominant anterior-posterior division (<a href=\"#bib51\">Suzuki and Amaral, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Insausti and Amaral, 2008</a>), as do single-unit recordings that show activity consistent with the rodent LEC in the anterior EC in primates (<a href=\"#bib29\">Killian et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, neuroimaging studies on memory in healthy participants (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schultz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Reagh and Yassa, 2014</a>) and participants with preclinical AD (<a href=\"#bib28\">Khan et al., 2014</a>) suggest that the rodent MEC and LEC map on medial and lateral strips of EC in humans."

An earlier study investigated entorhinal connectivity with high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but averaged signal changes over the entire region (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lacy and Stark, 2012</a>). To achieve higher resolution imaging, here we leveraged high-field, sub-millimetre fMRI at 7 T and sought to identify the human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC by informing our analysis by well-known functional and structural properties of the EC. Specifically, it has been shown that MEC and LEC exhibit differential connectivity with cortical regions (<a href=\"#bib58\">Witter and Groenewegen, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kerr et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Van Strien et al., 2009</a>). The differential fingerprints of anatomical connectivity should lead to differences in functional connectivity identifiable with fMRI (<a href=\"#bib26\">Johansen-Berg et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Buckner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). To test patterns of functional connectivity, we measured whole-brain activity while participants performed a virtual reality task with spatial and non-spatial components and validated the results in publicly available resting-state data from the WU-Minn Human Connectome Project (<a href=\"#bib20\">Van Essen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Smith et al., 2013</a>) (HCP\u2014<a href=\"www.humanconnectome.org\">www.humanconnectome.org</a>). In addition, differential sensitivity to spatial and non-spatial stimuli could provide converging evidence to identify the human homologue of the rodent MEC and LEC, which we tested in a third, independent dataset. A complementary approach to the global network perspective presented here is given by Maass et al. (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maass et al., 2015</a>) who scrutinized the fine-grained connectivity pattern of medial temporal lobe regions with the EC."

Studies in non-human primates predict that the entorhinal projections of the two systems show a strong anteroposterior division (<a href=\"#bib51\">Suzuki and Amaral, 1994</a>). In order to test this prediction and to elucidate the role of the EC, we first applied a model-based approach on fMRI data acquired while participants were performing a virtual-reality navigation task to directly mimic studies in rodents (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). This task targeted all entorhinal systems, because it involved both navigation-related spatial components and processing of non-spatial stimuli."

We found a main effect of network on entorhinal connectivity (repeated-measures ANOVA: F<sub>(1,21)</sub> = 10.0, p = 0.005).

                        "text": "In a second step, we wanted to overcome potential limitations of the seed-based analysis. For example, the selected volume and location of neocortical seed regions could introduce biases (e.g., spatial proximity of the seeds) and imperfect normalisation procedures could affect the results particularly in the frontal lobes where projections from both the rodent LEC and MEC are neighbouring (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kerr et al., 2007</a>). In addition, manual subdivision of the EC along cardinal axes likely misrepresents cytoarchitectonic boundaries. Therefore, we adopted a complementary approach to trace the dominant modes of functional connectivity change within the EC in a fully data-driven manner (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haak et al., 2014</a>) (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In brief, for every voxel in the EC, we determined its functional connectivity fingerprint with respect to the rest of cortex and used these fingerprints to compute the pair-wise similarities among all voxels within the ROI. The ensuing (voxels-by-voxels) similarity matrix was then fed to the Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) algorithm (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belkin and Niyogi, 2003</a>), which has previously also been successfully applied to trace changes in white-matter tractography (<a href=\"#bib26\">Johansen-Berg et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cerliani et al., 2012</a>) and resting-state fMRI connectivity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haak et al., 2014</a>). The LE algorithm projects the high-dimensional, voxel-wise connectivity data onto a series of one-dimensional vectors, with the requirement that the similarities among the connectivity fingerprints are maximally preserved (in the vein of e.g., multidimensional scaling). These vectors represent multiple, spatially overlapping maps (as revealed by colour-coding the EC voxels according to the vectors' values) and are sorted according to how well they preserve the similarities among the original, high-dimensional connectivity fingerprints. Thus, the first vector represents the dominant mode of connectivity change in the EC, the second represents the second-dominant mode, and so on."

Both modes of connectivity change could also be reliably detected using an independent resting-state fMRI dataset (60 subjects of the WU-Minn Human Connectome Project; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), suggesting that the organization of EC functional connectivity is largely task-independent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Both the first and second-dominant modes of functional connectivity change were highly reproducible across resting-state sessions (Pearson's R = 0.99, p &lt; 0.001 and Pearson's R = 0.98, p &lt; 0.001, for the dominant and second-dominant modes, respectively)."

To test this hypothesis, we computed whole-volume connectivity maps of the two clusters. Group-level contrasts showed peaks in the medial-prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex for the alEC, regions associated with the AT system. In contrast, occipital and posterior-parietal cortex was dominated by connectivity with the pmEC, areas associated with the PM system (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</a>). In addition, the pmEC showed increased connectivity with frontal regions (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These findings are in line with the patterns of reciprocal connections of the rodent LEC and MEC, respectively (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kerr et al., 2007</a>).

We tested this prediction by conducting a second fMRI study at 7 T in which an independent group of participants was presented with spatial (pictures of scenes) and non-spatial stimuli (pictures of objects), see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details. We contrasted fMRI responses to spatial and non-spatial stimuli.

While the shape and location of the EC differs between rodents and primates (<a href=\"#bib58\">Witter and Groenewegen, 1989</a>), the anatomical organisation and connectivity patterns are largely conserved across species (<a href=\"#bib6\">Canto et al., 2008</a>). However, translational studies on EC subregions faced the problem of identifying homologous regions across species. For example, recent neuroimaging studies on mnemonic processing (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schultz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Reagh and Yassa, 2014</a>) and Alzheimer's pathology (<a href=\"#bib28\">Khan et al., 2014</a>) directly related medial and lateral strips of EC in humans to the rodent MEC and LEC. However, the anatomical locations of these cytoarchitectonically defined regions in rodents differ along more than only the mediolateral axis. More specifically, the LEC is situated more anterior-ventrally, whereas the MEC is situated more posterior-dorsally in rodents (<a href=\"#bib54\">Van Strien et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, it is unlikely that medial and lateral strips of EC in humans correspond to the rodent MEC and LEC, respectively. Furthermore, in primates the characteristic projections from the PRC and PHC strongly map onto the anteroposterior axis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Suzuki and Amaral, 1994</a>). Here, we leveraged the distinct connectivity fingerprints and functional roles (such as complementary computation of scene and object information) of the rodent LEC and MEC to find their human homologues with fMRI with three complementary methods and three independent datasets. Both model-based and data-driven connectivity analyses, as well as sensitivity to non-spatial vs spatial stimuli provide evidence for an anterior-lateral and a PM localisation of the homologues of the rodent LEC and MEC, respectively. Maass et al confirmed these findings in a study with two high-resolution, high-field fMRI datasets by focusing on local connectivity between regions of the medial temporal lobes. They found preferential connectivity of PRC and proximal subiculum to anterior-lateral parts of the EC, whereas posterior-medial parts of the EC were more connected to PHC and distal subiculum. This corresponds well with our findings (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In line with the present study, Maass et al (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maass et al., 2015</a>) report local connectivity fingerprints of the human anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC that mimicked those of the rodent LEC and MEC, respectively."

In light of our findings, these reports could be explained by a partial overlap of the medial and lateral divisions with the pmEC and the alEC, respectively. For example, we noticed a mediolateral difference of responses to spatial and non-spatial stimuli on some coronal slices (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). However, our results suggest that coronal slices through the most posterior EC exclusively harbour the human homologue of the rodent MEC. Similarly, anterior slices appear to contain mostly the homologue of the rodent LEC. Hence, improved mapping of homologous regions between rodents and humans should lead to increased effect sizes and more accurate interpretations."

The use of a group-specific EPI template was feasible because of the anatomical detail provided by the sub-millimetre images. In addition, this rendered the registration to structural images unnecessary, which poses an additional source of noise because of regional differences in distortion of the 7 Tesla EPIs. The functional data were smoothed with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel of 2.5 mm<sup>3</sup> (roughly 2.5 times the voxel size) to increase the SNR and improve ICA-based data de-noising with the FIX procedure (see above) while maintaining high spatial resolution for connectivity analyses. Correction for residual motion artefacts was performed with an ICA-based method, which has been shown to outperform motion scrubbing and spike-regression methods both in terms of reproducibility of resting-state networks and conservation of temporal degrees of freedom (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pruim et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pruim et al., 2015b</a>).

Finally, Pearson's partial correlation coefficients were Fisher-Z transformed and used for across-subject comparisons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

First, the fMRI time series from the EC were rearranged into a time-by-voxels matrix, which was also done for the fMRI time series of all gray-matter voxels outside the EC. For reasons of stability and computational tractability, we losslessly reduced the dimensionality of the data outside the EC using SVD. We determined the connectivity fingerprints of each voxel inside the EC by computing the correlation between the voxel-wise time series and the SVD-transformed data, and then used the <i>\u03b7</i><sup>2</sup> coefficient to quantify the similarities among the voxel-wise fingerprints (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohen et al., 2008</a>). Next, we fed the ensuing similarity-matrix to the LE algorithm (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belkin and Niyogi, 2003</a>), resulting in a series of vectors that represent the dominant modes of functional connectivity change. The LE algorithm and variants thereof have previously been successfully applied to trace changes in probabilistic tractography connectivity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Johansen-Berg et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cerliani et al., 2012</a>), while in the context of resting-state fMRI, <i>ConGrads</i> has been shown to generate highly reproducible results in regions such as the human motor strip, both across sessions and participants (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haak et al., 2014</a>).

How to define an area in the brain is one problem, how to find the homologue of an area defined in one species in a second species is another question. The authors take an originally cytoarchitectonically defined subdivision of EC into LEC and MEC as the starting point, adding connectivity patterns as the defining second criterion. They then look for connection patterns in the human and find two regions as well. That supports the conclusion that the functional homologues of LEC and MEC can be defined in humans based on the data available (Discussion). In the same sentence it is clearly stated that the LEC homologue is situated anterolateral, while the MEC homologue is to be found at a posteromedial position. Unfortunately, then the trap snaps; the authors then claim that this position is different from that in the rodent since LEC means lateral and MEC means medial. Although they are correct that the given names indicate a position, this is a rather unfortunate interpretation/nomenclature, because in the rodent and in several other species MEC has a posteromedial preferred position and LEC an anterolateral. Maybe a bit less extreme as in the monkey and human, but not all that different. Several papers on the primate brain, including both monkey and human data, unfortunately make the same mistake and assume that all that has a lateral position in EC is LEC and all with a medial position is MEC. The authors correctly conclude that this is likely incorrect, but do not make this explicit and therefore add to the confusion."

At least for illustrative purposes, it would be useful to present separate results for each sphere and each EC ROI. Ideally they could show a correlation matrix with the 4 EC ROIs (well, actually 8, as described in my next point) in columns and the individual PM and then AT ROI spheres in rows. Hopefully, on a quick scan of the matrix, readers will be able to see differences in the connectivity profiles of the anterior lateral and posterior medial EC ROIs."

If so, it would be nice for the authors to spell this out, and to simplify the corresponding caption text for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. Also, if the algorithm is pulling out two connectivity gradients, could the relationship be more simply and intuitively captured by a single al-to-pm gradient. If it does not distort the actual patterns in the data, the authors should consider somehow merging the two connectopies to create simple alEC and pmEC ROIs.

Though understandable, the choice is very counterintuitive, since the septotemporal nomenclature is typically used for the non-primate hippocampus where one tip of the hippocampus is topologically associated with the septal complex. This is not the case in the primate, and therefore, most authors elected to use an anterior-posterior nomenclature. I strongly urge the authors to maintain this convention, irrespective of their valid argument that the AP axis does not completely reflect the tilted orientation of the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions in the human. From what is said in the Results, it is clear that the authors seem ambivalent about their newly introduced nomenclature."

How to define an area in the brain is one problem, how to find the homologue of an area defined in one species in a second species is another question. The authors take an originally cytoarchitectonically defined subdivision of EC into LEC and MEC as the starting point, adding connectivity patterns as the defining second criterion. They then look for connection patterns in the human and find two regions as well. That supports the conclusion that the functional homologues of LEC and MEC can be defined in humans based on the data available (Discussion). In the same sentence it is clearly stated that the LEC homologue is situated anterolateral, while the MEC homologue is to be found at a posteromedial position. Unfortunately, then the trap snaps; the authors then claim that this position is different from that in the rodent since LEC means lateral and MEC means medial. Although they are correct that the given names indicate a position, this is a rather unfortunate interpretation/nomenclature, because in the rodent and in several other species MEC has a posteromedial preferred position and LEC an anterolateral. Maybe a bit less extreme as in the monkey and human, but not all that different. Several papers on the primate brain, including both monkey and human data, unfortunately make the same mistake and assume that all that has a lateral position in EC is LEC and all with a medial position is MEC. The authors correctly conclude that this is likely incorrect, but do not make this explicit and therefore add to the confusion</i>."

Each time the EC was divided in two halves: Once along the anteroposterior (septotemporal) axis, once along the mediolateral/proximodistal axis. This approach was pursued to ensure comparable number of voxels per parcel and therefore comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) properties per parcel.

However, the connectivity profile\u2014as determined by invasive tracing studies\u2014of the rodent MEC and LEC is not fully segregated, but rather shows overlap. For example, all EC regions have reciprocal projections to the frontal lobes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kerr et al., 2007</a>) and our own data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) suggest this is the case in humans as well. <a href=\"#bib34\">Libby et al.

This is not the case in the primate, and therefore, most authors elected to use an anterior-posterior nomenclature.
