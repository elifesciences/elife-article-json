One response to these concerns has been the launch of a project to repeat selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in cancer biology (<a href=\"#bib12\">Morrison, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Errington et al., 2014</a>)."

The basic idea behind this approach is that a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for each replication is peer reviewed and published after suitable revisions. Crucially, data collection cannot begin until the Registered Report has been accepted for publication. The results of the experiments are then published as a Replication Study, irrespective of the outcome, but subject to peer review to check that the designs and protocols contained in the Registered Report were followed."

The papers selected for replication were those with the highest citation rates and altmetric scores (see <a href=\"#bib6\">Errington et al., 2014</a> for a full description of the selection process).

The experiments in the Reproducibility Project are typically powered to have an 80% probability of reproducing something that is true: this means that if we attempt to repeat three experiments from a paper, there is only a ~50% chance that all three experiments will yield significant p values, even if the original study was reproducible. Therefore, we cannot place the bar so high that the replications need to hit a significant p value in every experiment. If a replication reproduces some of the key experiments in the original study, and sees effects that are similar to those seen in the original in other experiments, we need to conclude that it has substantially reproduced the original study."

The first Registered Reports were published in December 2014 and a total of 29 have been published to date. Areas of concern that emerged during the peer review process included the limited budget for in vivo experiments and, in some cases, the possibility that the scope of the proposed experiments might not be sufficient to adequately explore the reproducibility of the original studies."

In particular, the experiments reported in the Replication Studies provide one indication of how readily reproducible previously published results are, but they cannot be considered conclusive evidence of the reproducibility, or lack of reproducibility, of any one study. For that, it will be necessary for the scientific community to aggregate results from multiple attempts by multiple groups\"."

However, this is also a potential disadvantage because the contract research laboratories performing the replications may not have the same level of expertise or motivation as the original laboratories."

The practice of specifying in advance precisely which experiments will be done, down to numbers of cells and replicates, is a strength because it avoids the possibility of biasing outcomes by mid-course changes in experiment. However, it has also proved to be a weakness in some cases because it has prevented experiments from being redone in different ways when the results were uninterpretable. This happened in a number of cases where control tumors grew with different kinetics than in the original studies despite attempts to use the same cells, same cell doses and same recipient mice."

However, restricting the scientists performing the replications to the experimental designs in the Registered Report meant that, in general, they were not able to redo the experiments with different cell doses to achieve more interpretable kinetics. This has been particularly problematic with tumor formation assays in vivo, in which variability is often high and results depend upon the experience of the investigator."

While we wait for this, it is important not to overinterpret the results. Already it is clear that nuanced interpretations are necessary, not black and white conclusions about which studies reproduced and which did not. It is also clear that this approach to testing reproducibility remains an experiment, with advantages and disadvantages, including the fact that it sometimes yields results that cannot be interpreted."
