Individuals with suppressed immunity, or suffering from chronic inflammatory conditions such as COPD, are particularly susceptible to influenza. Here we show that suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) five has a pivotal role in restricting influenza A virus in the airway epithelium, through the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). <i>Socs5</i>-deficient mice exhibit heightened disease severity, with increased viral titres and weight loss. <i>Socs5</i> levels were differentially regulated in response to distinct influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H11N9) and were reduced in primary epithelial cells from COPD patients, again correlating with increased susceptibility to influenza. Importantly, restoration of SOCS5 levels restricted influenza virus infection, suggesting that manipulating SOCS5 expression and/or SOCS5 targets might be a novel therapeutic approach to influenza."

Individuals with suppressed immunity, or suffering from chronic inflammatory conditions such as COPD, are particularly susceptible to influenza. Here we show that suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) five has a pivotal role in restricting influenza A virus in the airway epithelium, through the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). <i>Socs5</i>-deficient mice exhibit heightened disease severity, with increased viral titres and weight loss. <i>Socs5</i> levels were differentially regulated in response to distinct influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H11N9) and were reduced in primary epithelial cells from COPD patients, again correlating with increased susceptibility to influenza. Importantly, restoration of SOCS5 levels restricted influenza virus infection, suggesting that manipulating SOCS5 expression and/or SOCS5 targets might be a novel therapeutic approach to influenza."

In most instances the effects are largely socioeconomic, with infected individuals requiring bed-rest and recovering at home. However, for the very young, pregnant women, the elderly and the infirm, severe influenza can result in hospitalisation and even death, with seasonal strains accounting for 500,000 deaths annually (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hsu et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Vanders et al., 2015</a>). Those that succumb to the disease can die as a result of an unrestrained inflammatory response (often referred to as a \u2018cytokine storm\u2019), which together with cell death irretrievably damages the airways releasing fluid into the alveolar spaces (<a href=\"#bib50\">Short et al., 2014</a>).

For example, the virulent H5N1 virus, when transmitted from birds to humans has a 50% mortality rate (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fauci, 2006</a>) and since 2013, bird-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus has resulted in over 600 confirmed cases with a mortality rate of approximately 38%, triggering an emergency response in China (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hsu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Xu et al., 2013</a>).

While the physiological role and mechanism of action of SOCS1 and particularly SOCS3, are well understood, much less is known about the other family members (SOCS4-7), which in addition to the central phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domain and C-terminal SOCS box, contain an extended N-terminal region (<a href=\"#bib17\">Feng et al., 2012</a>).

SOCS box components (Elongins B and C, Rbx2 and Cullin5) were specifically enriched in SOCS5 immunoprecipitates, but not from cells transfected with vector alone. Similarly, the PI3K subunits p85 (PIK3R1), p85\u03b2 (PIK3R2) and p110\u03b2 (PIK3CB) were enriched in SOCS5 complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We confirmed these results by immunoblotting SOCS5 complexes. The SOCS5:PI3K (p85; p110\u03b1/\u03b2) complex was enriched in cells pre-treated with vanadyl hydroperoxide (pervanadate) (to block phosphatase activity), indicating that SOCS5 interaction with the PI3K complex was dependent on phosphorylation of one of the components (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Further, mutation of the SOCS5-SH2 domain (R406K) or deletion of the N-terminal 349 residues (\u0394NT) reduced SOCS5 interaction with the PI3K complex, whereas mutation of the SOCS box (L484P, C488F) had no effect on binding. Importantly, we utilised the lung epithelial A549 cell line to confirm, by co-immunoprecipitation, that endogenous SOCS5 and PI3K co-existed in a protein complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

SOCS5 protein was induced in healthy cells 24\u00a0h post-H1N1 infection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>) and was consistently reduced in cells from COPD patients, both at a basal level and with limited induction in response to virus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). SOCS5 expression inversely correlated with p110\u03b1 levels and virus-induced EGFR phosphorylation, AKT phosphorylation and viral protein, which was elevated in COPD hAECs as indicated by detection of intracellular viral HA protein (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

Depletion of SOCS5 resulted in enhanced levels of the PI3K p110\u03b1 catalytic subunit in both healthy and COPD hAECs and this occurred independently of virus. Depletion of SOCS5 also resulted in increased viral-induction of EGFR phosphorylation, and the changes in EGFR and PI3K again correlated with increased viral HA levels 2\u00a0h post-infection. Phosphorylation of AKT was also enhanced in some experiments (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">3</a>). Conversely, forced SOCS5 expression resulted in reduced p110\u03b1 and EGFR levels and reduced EGFR phosphorylation. Consistent with reduced PI3K p110\u03b1, SOCS5 also suppressed AKT phosphorylation in both healthy and COPD hAECs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>).

Here we link all three to the susceptibility and pathology associated with COPD patients and identify SOCS5 as a key negative regulator of these pathways. While the individual differences observed in AECs may appear modest, the defects in EGFR, PI3K and AKT need to be considered in combination and importantly, in the context of the entire lung. If these small differences occur across a large part of the whole airways in COPD, then the airways will become more susceptible to influenza, as will the patient. There is a fine balance between resistance and susceptibility to infection and these changes could alter the balance towards infection, especially when combined with other immune defects in COPD. Another example is the modest difference seen in IFN signaling in SOCS1-deficient cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brysha et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wormald et al., 2006</a>).

Phosphorylated EGFR recruits p85 PI3K to the receptor and activation of PI3K results in phosphorylation of phospholipids at the cell membrane, facilitating endocytosis of the virus, presumably through reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ehrhardt et al., 2006</a>). In addition to this important role for PI3K signaling at the early stages of infection, at later stages direct binding of the viral NS1 protein to PI3K enhances its stability and activation, reducing cell death and maintaining a replicative niche for the virus (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hale et al., 2006</a>).

Activation of the viral detection pathways results in the cleavage and shedding of EGFR ligands such as TGF\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ito et al., 2015</a>). If this were the case, EGFR activity may be enhanced in the absence of SOCS5. Ligand-independent EGFR clustering is thought to preferentially result in autophosphorylation of the PI3K docking site (Tyr 992), but not that of other more distal sites (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2016</a>). We speculate that SOCS5 may inhibit virus-induced receptor clustering and autophosphorylation and when SOCS5 is reduced, selective activation of the PI3K sites.

This suggests that in vivo, SOCS5 regulates PI3K-independent EGFR effects that are required for restraint of the infection. There are many consequences of EGFR signaling, not least of which is a Ras/MAPK-driven transcriptional response, which may explain the difference between the in vivo results and the short-term infections in vitro in primary human cells."

A feature was defined as the combination of peptide sequence, charge and modification. Features not found in at least half the number of replicates in each group were removed. Proteins identified from hits to the reverse database and proteins with only one unique peptide were also removed. To correct for injection volume variability, feature intensities were normalized by converting to base two logarithms and then multiplying each value by the ratio of maximum median intensity of all replicates over median replicate intensity. Features assigned to the same protein differ in the range of intensity due to their chemico-physical properties and charge state. To further correct for these differences, each intensity value was multiplied by the ratio of the maximum of the median intensities of all features for a protein over the median intensity of the feature. Missing values were imputed using a random normal distribution of values using the mean of the real distribution of values minus 1.8 standard deviations, and a standard deviation of 0.5 times the standard deviation of the distribution of the measured intensities (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cox et al., 2014</a>). The probability of differential expression between groups was calculated using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test excluding any non-unique sequences and any features with modifications other than oxidation and carbamidomethylation. Probability values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method. Cut-off lines with the function y= \u2212log10(0.05)+c/(x-x0) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Keilhauer et al., 2015</a>) were introduced to identify significantly enriched proteins. c was set to 0.2 while x0 was set to 1 or 2, representing proteins with a 2-fold (log2 protein ratio of 1) or 4-fold (log2 protein ratio of 2) change in protein expression, respectively. The Log2-transformed summed peptide intensities (non-imputed) were visualised in a heat map generated in one-matrix CIMminer, a program developed by the Genomics and Bioinformatics Group (Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute)."

In this manuscript, the authors report studies of influenza virus infection of SOCS5 knockout mice, cell cultures and biochemical analysis of EGFR-PI3K signaling pathway. They propose that SOCS5 is a critical regulator of influenza virus infection by regulating EGFR-PI3K signaling. The study also suggests the decreased level of SOCS5 gene is responsible for increased susceptibility of individuals with COPD to flu infection. It has been known for some time that SOCS5 can physically associate with EGFR, the activity of EGFR/PI3K and AKT has also been linked to flu infection in previous studies. This is the first study linking all these parts together and it provides some new insights into the host-virus interaction of this important virus. However, evidence provided in the manuscript is only suggestive and cannot support the major claims of the paper."

Authors should provide more clear biochemical data of SOCS5-mediated EGFR or PI3K suppression. Authors addressed the possibility in the Discussion that SOCS5 inhibits cluster-induced autophosphorylation. The reduction of SOCS5 expression leads to selective activation of the PI3K sites that would give a net increase in PI3K activity at the membrane, resulting in increased receptor endocytosis. However, this possibility is quite speculative. Another possibility may be that the SOCS5 binding to PI3K p110 leads to ubiquitination dependent degradation. This hypothesis is supported by the data of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>, which shows increased protein levels of PI3K p110 in <i>Socs5<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> cells, and also <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> which showed interaction of SOCS5 with PI3K complex. Authors should show in vitro ubiquitination of p110 by SOCS5 and enhanced proteasomal degradation of p110 by SOCS5 in infected or EGFR activated cells. If second possibility is the case, increase of p110 levels in COPD (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) can be explained easily."

It was shown before that Influenza A virus infection induces TGF release and EGFR activation in AECs (Ito et al., 2015).

In addition, we also compared the SOCS5 phenotype with that of Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>IL-2Rgc<sup>-/-</sup> SirpA mice, which lack T/B cells, NK cells and ILCs (Legrand et al., PNAS 2011). We were limited by the availability of gene-targeted mice on the Balbc background, but given that NK cells are a major lymphocytic population in the lung and are important in restraining early viral loads (Stein-Streilein et al., Reg Immunol 1998; J Immunol 1996), we felt that the SirpA mice would be a useful comparison. It is worth noting that very few studies have examined viral loads at 24 h post-inoculation. Loss of SOCS4 function resulted in a significant increase in influenza virus which was greater than that observed with loss of <i>Socs5</i>. The increased levels of virus in the <i>Socs5<sup>-/-</sup> </i>were comparable to those observed in Rag2<sup><sub>-/-</sub></sup>IL-2Rgc<sup><sub>-/-</sub></sup>SirpA mice. These data reveal that (i) the Socs5 phenotype is at least as significant as that observed in mice lacking innate lymphocytes, and (ii) SOCS4 appears to have an additional role to that described in Kedzierski et al., PLOS Pathogens 2014. This latter could be due to SOCS4 regulating EGFR, JAK/STAT or TLR2 signaling (Arts et al., J Intern Med 2015; Linossi et al., PLOS One 2013; Bullock et al., Structure 2007) and will be investigated further in a subsequent publication.

However, there is substantial evidence supporting a role for EGFR in viral entry and suppression of the anti-viral response (e.g. Eierhoff et al., Plos Pathogens 2010; Ueki et al., JEM 2013). Our new data further support this, with inhibition of EGFR signalling reducing viral loads in primary mouse and human wild-type epithelial cells. Furthermore, using a selective EGFR inhibitor we have now demonstrated that loss of SOCS5 regulation of EGFR activity is responsible for the increased susceptibility of <i>Socs5<sup><sub>-/-</sub> </sup></i>mice to influenza virus.

Differences at this timepoint are strongly supportive of a change in viral entry and/or trafficking, particularly in the context of known roles for EGFR-PI3K in viral infection. As a preliminary step towards investigating this, we compared the viral loads by adding inhibitors before or after addition of virus inoculum (plaque assay, 24 h post-infection). Our logic being that if the differences resulted from increased viral entry/trafficking then when the EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib was added post-infection we should retain the increased viral replication in Socs5-deficient cells. If the differences occurred during replication, then addition of EGFR inhibitor post-infection should have the same effect as that observed when added before infection (loss of the Socs5 difference).

Authors should provide more clear biochemical data of SOCS5-mediated EGFR or PI3K suppression.

The reduction of SOCS5 expression leads to selective activation of the PI3K sites that would give a net increase in PI3K activity at the membrane, resulting in increased receptor endocytosis. However, this possibility is quite speculative. Another possibility may be that the SOCS5 binding to PI3K p110 leads to ubiquitination dependent degradation. This hypothesis is supported by the data of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>, which shows increased protein levels of PI3K p110 in Socs5<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells, and also <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> which showed interaction of SOCS5 with PI3K complex.

If SOCS5 regulated these targets by proteasomal degradation, we would predict that target levels would increase in the presence of MG132 and that differences observed with knockdown or increased SOCS5 expression would be equalized in the presence of MG132. Consistent with all of our previous data, siRNA knockdown of SOCS5 resulted in increased phosphorylation of EGFR (pEGFR) and AKT (pAKT), increased PI3K p110\u03b1 levels and increased viral load (HA), whilst constitutive expression of SOCS5 had the converse effect, resulting in reduced pEGFR, pAKT, p110 and HA. However, incubation with MG132 for 4 h did not alter the level of the targets, suggesting that at the endogenous level, degradation through the proteasome is not a major source of regulation. Similarly, the differences observed with either SOCS5 knockdown or expression did not significantly change in the presence of MG132.
