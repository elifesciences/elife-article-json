Elevated levels of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) appear to drive neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease (PD); neuronal accumulation of tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); and their increased levels cause neurodegeneration in humans and model organisms. Despite the clinical differences between AD and PD, several lines of evidence suggest that \u03b1-Syn and tau overlap pathologically. The connections between \u03b1-Syn and tau led us to ask whether these proteins might be regulated through a shared pathway. We therefore screened for genes that affect post-translational levels of \u03b1-Syn and tau. We found that TRIM28 regulates \u03b1-Syn and tau levels and that its reduction rescues toxicity in animal models of tau- and \u03b1-Syn-mediated degeneration. TRIM28 stabilizes and promotes the nuclear accumulation and toxicity of both proteins. Intersecting screens across comorbid proteinopathies thus reveal shared mechanisms and therapeutic entry points."
