Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered histone PTM that is enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers in mammalian cell genomes. However, the cellular enzymes that regulate the addition and removal of Kcr are unknown, which has hindered further investigation of its cellular functions. Here we used a chemical proteomics approach to comprehensively profile \u2018eraser\u2019 enzymes that recognize a lysine-4 crotonylated histone H3 (H3K4Cr) mark. We found that Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 can catalyze the hydrolysis of lysine crotonylated histone peptides and proteins. More importantly, Sirt3 functions as a decrotonylase to regulate histone Kcr dynamics and gene transcription in living cells. This discovery not only opens opportunities for examining the physiological significance of histone Kcr, but also helps to unravel the unknown cellular mechanisms controlled by Sirt3, that have previously been considered solely as a deacetylase."

Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered histone PTM that is enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers in mammalian cell genomes. However, the cellular enzymes that regulate the addition and removal of Kcr are unknown, which has hindered further investigation of its cellular functions. Here we used a chemical proteomics approach to comprehensively profile \u2018eraser\u2019 enzymes that recognize a lysine-4 crotonylated histone H3 (H3K4Cr) mark. We found that Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 can catalyze the hydrolysis of lysine crotonylated histone peptides and proteins. More importantly, Sirt3 functions as a decrotonylase to regulate histone Kcr dynamics and gene transcription in living cells. This discovery not only opens opportunities for examining the physiological significance of histone Kcr, but also helps to unravel the unknown cellular mechanisms controlled by Sirt3, that have previously been considered solely as a deacetylase."

Three out of the seven sirtuin enzymes found in humans were revealed to bind to crotonylated histones. All three of these enzymes\u2014called Sirt1, Sirt2 and Sirt3\u2014could remove crotonyl groups from histones in a test-tube, and Sirt3 could also do the same in living cells. Further biochemical experiments suggested that the mechanism used by these enzymes to remove crotonyl groups is the same as the mechanism they use to remove acetyl groups."

This amino acid is also found in Sirt1 and Sirt2, but not in other sirtuins; this interaction can thus explain why decrotonylation activity was only detected for these three enzymes."

Increasing evidence has indicated that PTMs of histones can serve as a heritable \u2018code\u2019 (so-called \u2018histone code\u2019), which provides epigenetic information that a mother cell can pass to its daughters (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jenuwein and Allis, 2001</a>). Histone code is \u2018written\u2019 or \u2018erased\u2019 by enzymes that add or remove the modifications of histones (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goldberg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kouzarides, 2007</a>). Meanwhile, \u2018readers\u2019 of histone code recognize specific histone modifications and \u2018translate\u2019 the code by executing distinct cellular programs necessary to establish diverse cell phenotypes, while the genetic code (DNA) is unaltered (<a href=\"#bib30\">Seet et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Taverna et al., 2007</a>)."

Since its identification, histone Kac has been correlated with gene expression. However, the mechanistic insights into the regulation and functions of histone Kac remained challenging and elusive, until the identification and characterization of the enzymes responsible for the addition and removal of this PTM, which are now known as histone acetyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib27\">Roth et al., 2001</a>) and deacetylases (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sauve et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Yang and Seto, 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Haberland et al., 2009</a>), respectively. Extensive studies have now revealed that Kac plays an important role in controlling chromatin structure and gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib9\">Grunstein, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Yang and Seto, 2008a</a>). By neutralizing positively charged lysine residues, acetylation alters the coulumbic interactions between basic histones and the negatively charged DNA, and thereby influences the structure of chromatin compaction (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ura et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</a>). In addition, acetylation may serve as a docking site for \u2018reader\u2019 proteins (e.g., bromodomain containing proteins), which are recruited onto chromatin to carry out downstream cellular processes, such as gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dhalluin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Marmorstein and Berger, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Zeng et al., 2010</a>)."

In postmeiotic male germ cells, Kcr specifically marks testis specific X-linked genes, suggesting it is likely that it is an important histone mark for male germ cell differentiation. However, further mechanistic and functional studies of histone Kcr have been limited by a lack of knowledge of the enzymes that catalyze the addition or removal of Kcr in cells. In a systematic screening of the activities of the 11 human zinc-dependent lysine deacetylases (i.e., HDAC1\u2013HDAC11) against a series of C-terminal lysine acylated peptides, Olsen et al. found that HDAC3 in complex with nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (HDAC3\u2013NCoR1) had detectable decrotonylase activity towards a model peptide substrate in a fluorometric assay (<a href=\"#bib22\">Madsen and Olsen, 2012</a>). Recently, using a radioactive thin layer chromatography based assay, Denu et al. demonstrated that Sirt1 and Sirt2 can catalyze the removal of a crotonyl group from a histone H3K9Cr peptide (<a href=\"#bib6\">Feldman et al., 2013</a>). However, this discovery was based on a single peptide substrate. Due to lack of further characterization of these identified enzymes, their mechanisms of catalysis and the molecular bases of substrate recognition remain unclear. More importantly, since both discoveries relied on peptide based in vitro screening assays, there is still an essential need to identify endogenous histone decrotonylases."

A Cross-Linking Assisted and Stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) based Protein Identification (CLASPI) approach has recently been reported to identify histone PTM \u2018readers\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Li and Kapoor, 2010</a>). However, this approach has not previously been explored to identify histone PTM \u2018erasers\u2019, which are likely involved in weak and transient interactions. Here we present the application of an optimized CLASPI approach to comprehensively profile \u2018eraser\u2019 enzymes that recognize histone Kcr marks. We identified human Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 as decrotonylases in vitro and examined the molecular basis for how the enzymes recognize Kcr using X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Sirt3 can function as an \u2018eraser\u2019 enzyme to regulate histone crotonylation dynamics in living cells."

The probe is based on the unstructured N-terminal region of histone H3, with lysine-4 crotonylated, a photo-cross-linker (benzophenone) appended to alanine-7, and a bio-orthogonal handle (alkyne) at the peptide C terminus to enable selective isolation of captured binding partners.

The captured proteins were then conjugated to biotin using click chemistry, followed by affinity purification, gel electrophoresis, and in-gel trypsin digestion. The digested peptide mixtures were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and analyzed with a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Using this method, proteins that show a high SILAC ratio of heavy/light (H/L) are likely H3K4Cr selective binders. To further distinguish the high affinity interactions, we performed an \u2018affinity filter\u2019 CLASPI experiment, in which both lysates were photo-cross-linked with probe <b>1</b> but the \u2018light\u2019 sample also contained H3K4Cr peptide as a competitor (30 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

The asymmetric unit consists of six molecules, each containing one Sirt3\u2013H3K4Cr complex. The two globular domains of Sirt3 composed of an NAD binding Rossmann fold and a zinc binding motif are similar to other sirtuins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Avalos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Du et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yuan and Marmorstein, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>). Residues <sup>2</sup>RTKQTAR<sup>8</sup> of the H3K4Cr peptide were clearly identified based on electron density. The way that the substrate is bound is similar to the published complex structure of Sirt3, with a lysine acetylated AceCS2 peptide (PDB 3GLR) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jin et al., 2009</a>). The crotonyl lysine is located in a binding pocket formed by hydrophobic residues Phe180, Ile230, His248, Ile291, and Phe294 of Sirt3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Residue His248, a catalytic residue for the deacetylation activity of Sirt3, interacts with the crotonyl amide oxygen via hydrogen bonding in the structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Strikingly, the phenyl ring of residue Phe180 aligns parallel to the planar crotonyl group and has a short distance of 3.6 \u00c5 to its conjugated carbon\u2013carbon double bond (C=C) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C, D</a>), indicating a robust \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between the two functional groups. Interestingly, a primary sequence alignment of all sirtuins revealed that the phenylalanine residue (Phe180) of Sirt3 is conserved in Sirt1 and Sirt2, but not in other sirtuins (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which may explain why Sirt4\u2013Sirt7 were not identified in our CLASPI experiments. This \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction therefore underlies the mechanism for the recognition of crotonyl lysine by Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3."

Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to monitor hydrolysis of the H3K4Cr peptide by Sirt3. As expected, Sirt3 efficiently catalyzed the hydrolysis of the crotonyl peptide only in the presence of NAD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting an NAD-dependent decrotonylation mechanism. The steady state kinetic analysis revealed that the <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>, <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>, and <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for Sirt3 catalyzed decrotonylation of H3K4Cr were 0.010 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, 12.6 \u03bcM, and 783 s<sup>\u22121</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, we detected <i>O</i>-crotonyl-adenosine 5\u02b9-diphosphoribose (<i>O</i>-Cr-ADPR) as a product of this hydrolysis reaction (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A mutation of the catalytic residue (H248Y) that is crucial for the deacetylation activity of the enzyme also completely abolished its decrotonylation activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These data indicate that Sirt3 hydrolyzes crotonyl lysine with the same mechanism as it hydrolyzes acetyl lysine (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tanner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tanny and Moazed, 2001</a>). In addition to H3K4Cr, we also examined the activity of Sirt3 to hydrolyze a collection of crotonyl histone peptides (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tan et al., 2011</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013G</a>, Sirt3 manifested varied decrotonylation activities towards these peptides and this substrate selectivity can be partially explained by the binding affinities of Sirt3 to these peptides (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The observation that Sirt3 binds a crotonylated peptide by recognizing both the modification site and its surrounding residues was also supported by the extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions between Sirt3 and the peptide side chains in the Sirt3\u2013H3K4Cr complex structure (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Consistent with the work of Denu and coworkers, Sirt1 and Sirt2 also catalyzed the hydrolysis of the H3K4Cr peptide, although they were relatively weaker binders towards this substrate (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, for Sirt5 or Sirt6, little hydrolysis of the crotonyl peptide was observed (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). These results agree well with the observation that the phenylalanine residue, which is involved in recognition of crotonyl lysine via \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C, D</a>), is only conserved in Sirt1\u2013Sirt3 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To further examine the importance of this conserved phenylalanine to the decrotonylase activity of the enzyme, we mutated Phe180 of Sirt3 to a leucine residue (F180L), which lacks an aromatic ring as a \u03c0 donor but retains a similar hydrophobicity. We then carried out kinetic studies on this F180L mutant Sirt3. The steady state kinetic data showed that the catalytic efficiency of Sirt3 F180L mutant (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>=21 s<sup>\u22121</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>) for the hydrolysis of the H3K4Cr peptide was about 40-fold lower than that of wild-type Sirt3 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating a critical role of the phenylalanine mediated \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interaction in the decrotonylation activity of the enzyme. Interestingly, the F180L mutation caused only about a two-fold decrease in the deacetylation activity of the enzyme (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). This result rules out the possibility that the observed significant decrease in the decrotonylase activity of the enzyme is caused by a potential disruption of the NAD binding pocket in the mutated Sirt3."

A pan antibody against Kcr was used to assess protein crotonylation levels. While the incubations with Sirt1\u2013Sirt3 had little influence on lysine crotonylation in most of the protein bands, substantial reductions in Kcr levels were observed in two bands with a molecular mass of approximately 15 kDa (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Considering Sirt1\u2013Sirt3 can decrotonylate histone peptides in vitro, we speculated that these 15 kDa proteins with reduced Kcr levels could be histones. We therefore examined the decrotonylation activity of Sirt1\u2013Sirt3 using purified core histone proteins as substrates. Indeed, Sirt1\u2013Sirt3 not only reduced global Kcr levels of all core histones, they also showed robust decrotonylation activity towards two known histone Kcr sites, H3K4Cr and H3K27Cr (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Although Sirt1 and Sirt2 can decrotonylate histone peptides and proteins in vitro, their knockdowns by siRNA did not cause an appreciable increase in crotonylation levels for both the global histone and the two tested Kcr (i.e., H3K4Cr and H3K27Cr) sites (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, Sirt3 knockdown caused accumulation of global histone crotonylation and the H3K4Cr mark, while the histone H3K4Ac and H3K4Me3 levels were unaltered (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C, D</a>), suggesting that Sirt3 selectively targets histone crotonylation. Interestingly, the crotonylation level on H3K27 was not influenced by the knockdown of Sirt3, which may be explained by the observation that Sirt3 showed weaker activity towards the H3K27Cr peptide in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). It should be noted that Sirt3 was found to localize predominantly to mitochondria and was mainly involved in metabolic regulations through controlling protein acetylation dynamics. However, recent evidence has suggested that Sirt3 can also be present in the nucleus in its full length form (<a href=\"#bib29\">Scher et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Iwahara et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, using an antibody that targets the N-terminal region of Sirt3, we detected endogenous full length Sirt3 in the nucleus of HeLa cells by both immunofluorescence and western blotting analyses (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that endogenous Sirt3 can function as an \u2018eraser\u2019 enzyme to regulate histone crotonylation dynamics in cells."

                                "text": "Finally, we sought to determine the potential biological consequence of histone decrotonylation mediated by Sirt3. It has been reported that Sirt3 can bind to chromatin and cause repression of the neighboring genes in U2OS cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Iwahara et al., 2012</a>). We therefore hypothesized that Sirt3 could regulate gene transcription via controlling local histone Kcr levels. To test this hypothesis, we focused on seven candidate genes, <i>Baz2a</i>, <i>Brip1</i>, <i>Corin</i>, <i>Ptk2</i>, <i>Tshz3</i>, <i>Wapal</i>, and <i>Zfat</i>, whose transcription start sites are close to the Sirt3 enriched region. Chromatin precipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in U2OS cells with the pan anti-Kcr antibody to measure Kcr levels near the transcription start sites of the candidate genes. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, Sirt3 knockdown by siRNA resulted in significant increases in Kcr levels of five of the seven genes analyzed, indicating that Sirt3 may directly regulate crotonylation dynamics at the genomic loci where it binds. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of the three candidate genes with increased Kcr levels, <i>Ptk2</i>, <i>Tshz3</i>, and <i>Wapal</i>, were also significantly upregulated on Sirt3 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Given that histone Kcr is enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tan et al., 2011</a>), this positive correlation between the gene transcription level and the nearby histone Kcr level on Sirt3 knockdown suggests that Sirt3 might relieve a repressive effect on these target genes through \u2018erasing\u2019 histone Kcr \u2018marks\u2019."

There have been important advances in our ability to detect PTMs. However, we currently lack reliable methods to identify, without bias, enzymes that regulate the addition and removal of PTMs, as interactions between PTMs and their regulating enzymes can be weak and transient, thereby limiting the applicability of conventional biochemical \u2018pull-down\u2019 methods. Our CLASPI approach overcame this difficulty by applying photo-cross-linking chemistry to convert weak and transient enzyme\u2013PTM interactions into irreversible covalent linkages, and enabled a systematic profiling of the \u2018erasers\u2019 of protein PTMs. The present study has also largely broadened the scope of CLASPI technology from finding PTM \u2018readers\u2019(<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Li and Kapoor, 2010</a>), which are usually involved in relatively more stable protein\u2013protein interactions, to identifying dynamic and transient interactions between PTMs and their \u2018erasers\u2019.

However, emerging evidence revealed that some sirtuins that displayed weak deacetylation activity had substrate specificity towards other acyl groups attached to lysine residues. For examples, Lin et al. recently demonstrated that Sirt5 can preferentially hydrolyze malonyl and succinyl lysine (<a href=\"#bib5\">Du et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Peng et al., 2011</a>), and Sirt6 can remove long chain fatty acyl groups (e.g., myristoyl group) from lysine residues (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>). In this study, we demonstrated that the three human sirtuins, Sirt1\u2013Sirt3, catalyzed the hydrolysis of crotonyl lysine. This newly discovered decrotonylase activity broadens the landscape of PTMs that are targeted by sirtuins, and it also provides new impetus to investigate the cellular mechanisms and functions of Sirt1\u2013Sirt3, which to date have been considered solely as deacetylases. This finding is also partially in agreement with the work of Denu and coworkers, in which only Sirt1 and Sirt2 exhibited decrotonylase activity, whereas Sirt3 was totally inactive, towards a histone H3K9Cr peptide in their radioactive [<sup>32</sup>P]-NAD thin layer chromatography assay. In contrast, Sirt3 displayed robust decrotonylase activity against a variety of crotonylated histone peptides, including an H3K9Cr peptide in this study (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Given the fact that the activity of Sirt3 can be peptide sequence-dependent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), this discrepancy may be caused by the different H3K9Cr peptide substrates used in Denu's and this study, which consisted of amino acid residues 5\u201313 and 1\u201315 of histone H3, respectively."

Future studies are therefore needed to systematically profile mammalian crotonylome and analyze the lysine crotonylation sites that are targeted by Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3, by comparing the corresponding wild-type and genetic knockout cells or tissues in conjunction with quantitative proteomics approaches."

However, Sirt3, in its full length form, has recently been found in the nucleus, and nuclear Sirt3 can associate with chromatin and result in repression of nearby genes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Scher et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Iwahara et al., 2012</a>). Based on the focused analysis at several Sirt3 target gene loci, the current study suggests a potential correlation of the transcriptional upregulation and the increase in local histone Kcr levels on Sirt3 knockdown. It also generates a hypothesis that Sirt3 could lead to silencing through \u2018erasing\u2019 Kcr at target genes. To test this hypothesis and examine the correlation between Sirt3 catalyzed histone deacrotonylation and gene expression genome-wide requires comprehensive profiling of global histone Kcr and gene expression regulated by Sirt3 using ChIP coupled to high throughput sequencing, in combination with RNA sequencing in future studies."

By analogy, it is possible that crotonylation at specific lysine sites of histones could also play different roles in the regulation of gene expression.

The study of the effects of site-specific histone Kcr \u2018marks\u2019 (e.g., H3K4Cr) targeted by Sirt3 on the regulation of gene expression is an important next step."

What is not mentioned is that this residue is known to interact strongly with NAD in prior structural work (e.g. Wolbergers comprehensive studies, which include termolecular structures of both NAD and peptides bound to sirtuin active sites). The authors state that this residue is not conserved in SIRT4-7, but its identification and conservation has been supported by many sequence comparison and structural studies. The observed lack of decrotonylation activity upon mutation may therefore be a consequence of disrupted NAD binding rather than demonstrating substrate selectivity. It also questions whether the observed binding mode in the absence of NAD is relevant if NAD is bound to the enzyme. Steady state parameters for the decrotonylation activity of the mutant and binding studies of NAD and the crotonylated peptide to the mutant may be able to address these concerns."

The first line of evidence involves the direct visualization of recombinant GFP-fused or epitope-tagged Sirt3 in the mitochondria of cells through GFP fluorescence or immunofluorescence (IF) using antibodies against the fused tags, respectively (see references 1-4 and 7-9 in the table above). The second line of evidence is from the detection of overexpressed epitope-tagged Sirt3 and endogenous Sirt3 in the mitochondrial fractions of cells by immunoblotting (IB) using anti-tag and anti-Sirt3 antibodies, respectively (see reference 1,3 and 6-9 in the table above). It should be noted that in these studies the detection of endogenous Sirt3 relied on antibodies that recognize the C-terminal regions of Sirt3. These anti-Sirt3 (<i>C</i>-term) antibodies have been used to reveal the localization of endogenous Sirt3, more specifically, short-form (i.e., N-terminal truncated) Sirt3, in the mitochondria fractions using immunoblotting analysis. However, the application of the anti-Sirt3 (<i>C</i>-term) antibodies to detect of endogenous full-length Sirt3 has not been limited in these studies, most likely due to the relatively low abundance of full-length Sirt3. Also, the IF detection of endogenous Sirt3 using these antibodies has NOT been shown in these studies."

Using this anti-Sirt3 (<i>N</i>-term) antibody, endogenous Sirt3 was detected in the nucleus of HEK 293 and HeLa cells by IF (see reference 11 in the table above).

First, we prepared mitochondrial and nuclear fractions from HeLa cells and examined whether endogenous Sirt3 were present in these fractions by Western blotting using antibodies that target the <i>C</i>-terminal (from Cell signaling) and the <i>N</i>-terminal (from D. Reinberg lab) regions of Sirt3, respectively. Consistent with the literature, while the short-form Sirt3 were identified in the mitochondrial fraction exclusively, we indeed detected full-length Sirt3 in the nuclear fraction (see <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 3b</a>). Furthermore, using anti-Sirt3 (<i>N</i>-term) antibody, we were also able to show that Sirt3 indeed localize in the nucleus of the HeLa cells using IF (see <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 3a</a>). In addition, another line of evidence that supports the nuclear localization of Sirt3 came from our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) type of experiments. As mentioned above, Sirt3 was found to localize to a broad variety of genomic regions (see reference 12 in the table above). We therefore focused some of these regions and examined whether Sirt3 could regulate the lysine crotonylation (Kcr) levels on these regions. Our data showed that knockdown of Sirt3 indeed caused significant increase in Kcr levels of the tested genomic regions (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>). This result will be further discussed in our response to the point #4 raised by the reviewers."

We found that Sirt3 knockdown by siRNA resulted in significant increases in the Kcr levels of five of the seven genes analyzed, indicating that Sirt3 may directly regulate crotonylation dynamics at the genomic loci where it binds to (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>). Interestingly, the mRNA levels of the three candidate genes with increased Kcr levels, <i>Ptk2</i>, <i>Tshz3</i> and <i>Wapal</i>, were also significantly up-regulated upon Sirt3 knockdown (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a> ). Given that histone Kcr is enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers, this positive correlation between the gene transcription level and the nearby histone Kcr level upon Sirt3 knockdown suggests that Sirt3 might relieve a repressive effect on these target genes through \u2018erasing\u2019 histone Kcr \u2018marks\u2019. To examine this correlation genome-wide requires comprehensive profiling of global histone Kcr and gene expression regulated by Sirt3 using ChIP couple to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), in combination with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in future studies."

The study of the effects of site-specific histone Kcr \u2018marks\u2019 (e.g., H3K4Cr) targeted by Sirt3 on the regulation of gene expression is an important next step. Unfortunately, in our preliminary ChIP-qPCR study, we found that the only commercial available antibody that target H3K4Cr (from PTM BioLabs) is not suitable for ChIP experiments (the immune-precipitated chromatin was less than 0.1% of input). Therefore, new antibodies for this purpose need to be developed in future studies."

What is not mentioned is that this residue is known to interact strongly with NAD in prior structural work (e.g. Wolbergers comprehensive studies, which include termolecular structures of both NAD and peptides bound to sirtuin active sites). The authors state that this residue is not conserved in SIRT4-7, but its identification and conservation has been supported by many sequence comparison and structural studies. The observed lack of decrotonylation activity upon mutation may therefore be a consequence of disrupted NAD binding rather than demonstrating substrate selectivity. It also questions whether the observed binding mode in the absence of NAD is relevant if NAD is bound to the enzyme. Steady state parameters for the decrotonylation activity of the mutant and binding studies of NAD and the crotonylated peptide to the mutant may be able to address these concerns</i>."

Indeed, Wolberger\u2019s studies revealed that an invariant Phe33 in Sir2Tm (conserved in sirtuins and corresponding to human Sirt3 Phe157 rather than Phe180) strongly interacts with NAD. To the best of our knowledge, the interaction between Phe180 of Sirt3 and NAD have not been described. In our crystal structure of Sirt3-H3K4Cr complex, Phe180 is involved in recognition of crotonyl lysine via \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interaction. To further examine the importance of this conserved phenylalanine to the enzymes\u2019 decrotonylase activity, we mutated Phe180 of Sirt3 to a leucine residue, which lacks an aromatic ring as a \u03c0-donor but remains a similar hydrophobicity. We then carried out kinetic studies on this F180L mutant Sirt3. The steady-state kinetics data showed that the catalytic efficiency of Sirt3 F180L mutant (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 21 s<sup>-1</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) for the hydrolysis of the H3K4Cr peptide was about 40-fold lower than that of wild-type Sirt3 (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 783 s<sup>-1</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), indicating a critical role of the phenylalanine-mediated \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interaction in the enzymes\u2019 decrotonylation activity. Interestingly, the F180L mutation caused only around 2-fold decrease in the enzyme\u2019s deacetylation activity (see <a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 6</a>). This result rules out the possibility that the observed significant decrease in the enzyme\u2019s decrotonylase activity is caused by a potential disruption of the NAD-binding pocket in the mutated Sirt3."
