FK506 treatment of dendritic cells (FKDC) limits their capacity to stimulate T cell responses. FK506 does not prevent DC survival, maturation, or costimulatory molecule expression, suggesting that the limited capacity of FKDC to stimulate T cells may be due to inhibition of calcineurin signaling in the DC. Instead, we demonstrate that DC inhibit T cells by sequestering FK506 and continuously releasing the drug over several days. T cells encountering FKDC proliferate but fail to upregulate the survival factor bcl-xl and die, and IL2 restores both bcl-xl and survival. In mice, FKDC act in an antigen-specific manner to inhibit T-cell mediated autoimmune arthritis. This establishes that DCs can act as a cellular drug delivery system to target antigen specific T cells."

FK506 treatment of dendritic cells (FKDC) limits their capacity to stimulate T cell responses. FK506 does not prevent DC survival, maturation, or costimulatory molecule expression, suggesting that the limited capacity of FKDC to stimulate T cells may be due to inhibition of calcineurin signaling in the DC. Instead, we demonstrate that DC inhibit T cells by sequestering FK506 and continuously releasing the drug over several days. T cells encountering FKDC proliferate but fail to upregulate the survival factor bcl-xl and die, and IL2 restores both bcl-xl and survival. In mice, FKDC act in an antigen-specific manner to inhibit T-cell mediated autoimmune arthritis. This establishes that DCs can act as a cellular drug delivery system to target antigen specific T cells."

FK506 is a potent inhibitor of calcineurin, a phosphatase stimulated by T cell receptor signaling to regulate the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Through this mechanism, FK506 inhibits IL2 production (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bierer et al., 1990</a>) and triggers activated T cell death (<a href=\"#bib12\">Horigome et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Migita et al., 1999</a>). FK506 also limits the capacity of dendritic cells (DC) to stimulate allogeneic T cell responses in vitro (<a href=\"#bib31\">Woltman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Szabo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Duperrier et al., 2005</a>). While other immunosuppressants, including rapamycin and mycophenolate, are known to inhibit DC maturation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hackstein and Thomson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Popov et al., 2006</a>) and thereby ameliorate autoimmunity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Popov et al., 2006</a>) or promote long term transplant tolerance when transferred in vivo (<a href=\"#bib29\">Turnquist et al., 2007</a>), FK506 does not inhibit DC maturation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Woltman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Szabo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Duperrier et al., 2005</a>). These observations have suggested that FK506-mediated blockade of calcineurin signaling in DCs impacts T cell stimulation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hackstein and Thomson, 2004</a>). Instead, we find that FK506 treated DC (FKDC) sequester and release the drug itself, at doses sufficient to block T cell activation, to target antigen specific immune responses and to prevent collagen induced arthritis in mice. This demonstrates that DC can act as a biologic agent for drug delivery, with the potential to reduce drug dose and increase specificity in the treatment of autoimmune disease."

                                "text": "To examine the mechanism by which FK506 acts upon DCs, we treated human DC with FK506 (FKDC) for 40 hr during maturation. Despite washing to remove residual drug from the supernatants, FKDC were less effective stimulators of allogeneic T cell proliferation than DC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Similarly, when memory T cell responses to influenza were measured by IFN\u03b3 Elispot assay (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albert et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Orange et al., 2004</a>), FKDC were found to be markedly less stimulatory than untreated DCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Moreover, in agreement with previous work (<a href=\"#bib31\">Woltman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Duperrier et al., 2005</a>), DC survival, maturation, expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules were unaffected by FK506 treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and therefore could not account for their reduced stimulatory capacity. We next exposed DC to FK506 for various times. Unexpectedly, FK506 pretreatment of mature DC for as little as 20 min led to the same level of T cell inhibition in the IFN\u03b3 Elispot assay as pretreatment for 40 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), reminiscent of previous work demonstrating maximal <sup>3</sup>H-FK506 uptake by Jurkat T cells in only 20 min of FK506 treatment (<a href=\"#bib26\">Siekierka et al., 1989b</a>). The allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (allo-MLR) and Elispot assay require prolonged co-culture (5 days and 40 hr, respectively). To better define the molecular nature of the FKDC effect, T cells and DC were co-cultured for only 6 hr and IFN\u03b3 mRNA induction was measured by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the results from Elispot assays, FKDC were poor inducers of T cell IFN\u03b3 mRNA responses to influenza (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). To determine if FKDC lack an activating signal or produce an inhibitory signal, untreated DC were mixed with FKDC. Combining FKDC with untreated DC inhibited the T cell stimulatory capacity of the untreated DC in a dose dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). To test whether inhibition was mediated by a secreted factor, T cells were resuspended in DC or FKDC supernatant and stimulated with anti-CD3/28. FKDC supernatants, but not those of untreated DC, were potent inhibitors of IFN\u03b3, IL17A, IL4 and IL2 induction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that FKDC produce a T cell inhibitor."

                                "text": "To test if the inhibitory action of FKDC requires new gene transcription, translation or translocation through the secretory pathway, FKDC were pretreated with actinomycin, emetine, or brefeldin A prior to FK506 treatment. After washing and co-culture with T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/28, none of these treatments affected FKDC secretion of the T cell inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We hypothesized that FK506 diffuses passively from FKDC, despite adequate washout from initial cultures. Two approaches were used to test this hypothesis: a direct measurement of FK506 from FKDC culture supernatants and a functional assay to determine if the inhibitory effect of FKDC supernatants could be abolished by removal of FK506 from the media. First, DC were treated with FK506, washed extensively, and cultured for 1\u20134 days, during which time they were washed daily and supernatants collected 6 hr later. FK506 was maintained in the supernatants at levels sufficient to block T cell activation for 72 hr after initial washout (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Next, to assess whether FK506 is the only inhibitor, supernatants were treated with magnetic beads coated with FK-1 antibody that binds with high affinity to FK506 and then immunoadsorbed on a magnetic column. T cells were resuspended in FK-1 depleted or control supernatants and stimulated with anti-CD3/28. Treatment of FKDC supernatants with FK-1 depleted supernatant specifically abolished the inhibitory factor completely (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To determine how FKDC might function as a repository for FK506, we evaluated DC gene expression profiles for expression of FK binding proteins. DCs express several FKBP, with FKBP12 (also known as FKBP1A) being the most robustly expressed (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting that these proteins act in concert as an FK506 drug sink. Rapamycin is another immunomodulatory drug, which binds FKBP12, and it binds FKBP12 with higher affinity than FK506 (FK506 K<sub>d</sub> = 0.4 nM, Rapamycin K<sub>d</sub> = 0.2 nM) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bierer et al., 1990</a>). Unlike FK506, which blocks IL2 cytokine production, Rapamycin inhibits the downstream effects of IL2R signaling. The binding of FK506 and Rapamycin to a common intracellular protein was originally demonstrated in Jurkat T cells, which were rendered resistant to FK506 mediated blockade of IL2 induction when pretreated with Rapamycin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bierer et al., 1990</a>). We used this strategy to test if FKBP12 is specifically important for the accumulation of FK506 in DCs. Similar to the reported results in Jurkat cells, we found that pretreatment with Rapamycin renders FKDC unable to block IL2 induction in T cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This data indicates FKBP12 plays a physiologically relevant role in mediating the action of FKDC on T cell inhibition."

Previous work suggests that T cell activation when calcineurin is inhibited leads to antigen specific T cell death (<a href=\"#bib30\">Vanier and Prud'homme, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Migita et al., 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Horigome et al., 1998</a>). To examine the effect of FKDC on T cell survival, CFSE labeled T cells were cultured with allogeneic FKDC or untreated DC and apoptosis was measured by annexin V staining of undivided and postmitotic cells. There was no difference in the amount of cell death in undivided T cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). As expected, proliferating T cells stimulated with untreated DC divided, and adding IL2 increased cell death consistent with overstimulation of the IL2 pathway and induction of activation induced cell death (AICD) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lenardo, 1991</a>). In contrast, T cells proliferating in response to FKDC were twice as likely to die and IL2 increased survival (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting FK506 blocked normal T cell signaling, including IL2 production, such that cell survival was rescued by additional IL2. Since activated T cell death can be AICD-independent (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hildeman et al., 2002</a>) and regulated by bcl-2 family members, we examined this pathway. Fewer proliferating T cells upregulated the survival factor bcl-xl in response to FKDC than untreated DC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggesting cell autonomous (mitochondrial mediated) cell death (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akbar et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hildeman et al., 2002</a>), consistent with reports that FK506 sensitizes activated T cells to apoptosis by blocking bcl-xl induction (<a href=\"#bib19\">Migita et al., 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">1997</a>). Moreover, we found IL2 augments bcl-xl induction and rescues T cells from death (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Furthermore, IL2 rescues IFN\u03b3 production in FKDC activated memory T cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In conclusion, co-culture of T cells with FKDC initiates a program of activation that leads to increased apoptosis."

In work by Takagishi et al, groups of 10\u201316 DBA/1 mice were immunized with intradermal bovine CII emulsified in CFA (similar to the method of arthritis induction in this manuscript). They compared 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/kg FK506 or saline injected subcutaneously each day between day 0 and day 13. Mice treated with 4 mg/kg FK506 do not develop any arthritis; however mice treated with 1 mg/kg FK506 receive no protection from arthritis. Mice treated with 2 mg/kg on day 0\u201313 led to a 50% reduction in arthritis severity compared to placebo."

Six to 10 mice were allocated to one of three treatment groups: subcutaneous 2 mg/kg FK506 or PBS control daily for 14 days, or 0.5 million FKDC-CII intravenously on day 7 and 14. Maximal effects of either treatment regimen would be expected shortly after the last dose. Serum collected on day 14, after the last dose of either treatment regimen, was assayed for its ability to inhibit T cell activation, a standard assay for FK506 toxicity. We found that serum from mice treated with 2 mg/kg FK506, but not mice treated with FKDC, potently inhibits T cell activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This is consistent with higher serum levels of FK506 and systemic immunosuppression in mice treated with conventional FK506 treatment compared to DC based FK506 delivery. We also screened mice in the above treatment groups on day 14 for serum fasting glucose, amylase, lipase, BUN, AST and ALT. Amylase was increased in the systemic FK506 treatment group but not in the FKDC treatment group (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). This result is consistent with prior studies revealing toxicity to the exocrine pancreas in rats (<a href=\"#bib7\">Doi et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ito et al., 1994</a>). There were no significant differences in the glucose, BUN, lipase, AST and ALT between any treatment groups (data not shown). We conclude that in vivo transfer of antigen pulsed FKDC modulate immune outcomes in an antigen specific manner and protect from systemic immunosuppression and off target organ toxicity."

The capacity of DCs to accumulate FK506 likely relates to their high expression of binding proteins such as FKBP12, which have high affinity for FK506 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Siekierka et al., 1989a</a>). This suggestion is supported by the observation that T cells, which also express high levels of FKBP12, have the ability to concentrate radiolabeled FK506 500\u20131000 fold (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dumont et al., 1994</a>). These observations also suggest the possibility that the use of such cellular drug sinks could be extended to other cell types with abundant FKBP expression, or even extrapolated to other agents with analogous intracellular binding proteins."

The lack of efficacy of FKDC loaded with irrelevant antigen indicates that the amount of drug delivered by FKDC is not by itself sufficient to elicit a systemic effect. Upon encounter with antigen-specific FKDC, T cells initiate a program of activation but then undergo apoptosis, explaining the antigen specific effect of FKDC transferred in vivo. Systemic treatment of CIA with FK506 requires a minimum of 2 mg/kg or approximately 40 \u03bcg subcutaneously to elicit any therapeutic effect (<a href=\"#bib28\">Takagishi et al., 1989</a>). In contrast, the amount of FK506 measured in culture supernatants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) predicts the dose delivered by 0.5 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> FKDC is a maximum of 5 ng; this means 8000-fold less drug is required to elicit a therapeutic effect when delivered by a DC. Since DC can be pulsed with antigen of interest prior to drug loading, DC based drug delivery has the potential to limit adverse events by substantially limiting required doses by precisely targeting antigen specific T cells. Antigen-loaded DC have been widely used with excellent safety profiles (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sabado and Bhardwaj, 2010</a>), and this platform may be of interest to explore in clinical studies."

Each CIA group contained 8\u201312 mice. Results from pilot experiments indicated that seven mice per group were required to obtain more than 80% power to detect a 50% reduction in arthritis severity score at 0.05 level. A linear mixed model was used to model arthritis severity score of mice, then a likelihood ratio test was conducted to compare if arthritis severity score of mice vaccinated with various DC groups differed. The generalized estimating equation modeled incidence of severe arthritis in mice vaccinated with the various DC groups. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between clinical mean arthritis severity scores and radiographic scores and histopathology severity scores. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare radiographic and histopathology scores of the mice treated with FKDC/CII or DC/CII."

Because the amount of FK506 delivered by FKDC is 10,000 fold less than the minimal effective dose of systemic FK506 to treat collagen induced arthritis, we hypothesized that efficacy at lower doses would translate to less toxicity. However, we did not actually demonstrate this."

FK506 is the most commonly used drug for the prevention of transplant rejection, and hundreds of thousands of humans have been treated systemically with it. In humans, an oral dose of 0.2\u20130.3 mg/kg/day or a parenteral dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day is known to lead to a high incidence of adverse effects [1,2], including diabetes (up to 25%), renal insufficiency (up to 56%), hypertension (up to 62%), and liver function abnormalities (up to 36%). The toxicities seen in humans were not predicted by extensive preclinical testing in rodents. For example, comprehensive evaluation of Lewis rats demonstrated that groups receiving either 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg/day of oral FK506 (all higher doses than are used in humans) tolerated the drug; the animals had a mild, transient weight loss and only minor histolopathologic abnormalities such as perivascular eosinophilia without vascular damage in the lung [3]. There were no reproducible changes in sections of skin, muscle, fat, intestine, liver, kidney, spleen, or heart. On the other hand, subsequent work using similar doses in beagle dogs led to remarkable emaciation, vomiting and arteritis [4,5,6,7] and death of 17% of treated baboons [9]."

They compared 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/kg FK506 or saline injected subcutaneously each day between day 0 and day 13. Mice treated with 4 mg/kg FK506 do not develop any arthritis; however, mice treated with 1 mg/kg FK506 receive no protection from arthritis. Mice treated with 2 mg/kg on day 0\u201313 led to a 50% reduction in arthritis severity compared to placebo."

Maximal effects of either treatment regimen would be expected shortly after the last dose. Serum collected on day 14, after the last dose of either treatment regimen, was assayed for its ability to inhibit T cell activation, a standard assay for FK506 toxicity and one in which cells from rodents and humans are similarly affected by FK506 [10]. We found that serum from mice treated with 2 mg/kg FK506, but not mice treated with FKDC, potently inhibits T cell activation (Author response image 1; included as Figure 4E in the revised article). This is consistent with higher serum levels of FK506 and systemic immunosuppression in mice treated with conventional FK506 treatment compared to DC based FK506 delivery."

This led to the hypothesis that DCs accumulate significant levels of the drug because of their abundant expression of FK506 binding proteins, the most highly expressed of which is FKBP12. Rapamycin is another immunomodulatory drug, which binds FKBP12, and it binds FKBP12 with higher affinity than FK506 (FK506 K<sub>d</sub> = 0.4 nM, Rapamycin K<sub>d</sub> = 0.2 nM) [13]. Unlike FK506, which blocks IL2 cytokine production, Rapamycin inhibits the downstream effects of IL2R signaling. The binding of FK506 and Rapamycin to a common intracellular protein was originally demonstrated in Jurkat T cells, which were rendered resistant to FK506 mediated blockade of IL2 induction when pretreated with Rapamycin [13]. We used this strategy to test if FKBP12 is specifically important for the accumulation of FK506 in DCs. Similar to the reported results in Jurkat cells, we found that pretreatment with Rapamycin renders FKDC unable to block IL2 in T cells (Author response image 3; included as Figure 2D in the revised submission). These data indicate that FKBP12 plays a physiologically relevant role in mediating the action of FKDC on T cell inhibition."
