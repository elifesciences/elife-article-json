Recently, there has been debate over whether an aggressive (i.e., high dose) or more moderate (i.e., lower dose) treatment of individuals will most limit the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate how one can understand and resolve these apparently contradictory conclusions. We show that a key determinant of which treatment strategy will perform best at the individual level is the extent of effective competition between resistant and sensitive pathogens within a host. We extend our analysis to the community level, exploring the spectrum between strict inter-strain competition and strain independence. From this perspective as well, we find that the magnitude of effective competition between resistant and sensitive strains determines whether an aggressive approach or moderate approach minimizes the burden of resistance in the population."

In the models, aggressive antibiotic treatment is most effective (in that it minimizes antibiotic resistance) when the antibiotic-resistant strain either does not experience strong competition from the non-resistant strains of bacteria or is not fit enough to be a good competitor. However, a more moderate treatment is appropriate when the two strains are competing and the antibiotic-resistant strain is a fit competitor. Competition may mean that moderate treatment is best to avoid resistance at the community level, even in situations when aggressive treatment is likely best for individuals."

While an accurate assessment of the current health and economic losses attributable to antibiotic resistance is elusive, the estimated numbers, ranging up to 2 million serious infections, 23,000 deaths, and 35 billion dollars in the United States alone, are staggering (<a href=\"#bib5\">CDC, 2013</a>).

A public health practitioner will likely seek to identify which treatment practices produce the greatest health gains while minimizing the long-term levels of resistance in the community. The recent debate over aggressive and moderate approaches has mainly been centered on identifying an optimal strategy for the treatment of individual hosts to minimize the probability of resistance. However, the emergence and subsequent transmission of resistance in the population may be of even greater concern. From a theoretical perspective, optimal dosing strategies for the prevention of resistance in individuals are not necessarily optimal for limiting resistance at the population level (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lipsitch and Samore, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mills et al., 2013</a>)."

We demonstrate that the extent of effective competition between drug-susceptible and drug-resistant isolates is a key determinant of whether an aggressive approach is better (in terms of resistance prevention) than a moderate approach for hosts being treated for disease. Most importantly, we find that even within a model that allows for very strong competition, different realistic combinations of parameter values can support the aggressive or moderate approach as optimal. We illustrate how it is possible that models can support two such different conclusions by carefully considering the dominant interactions between the strains. We extend our analysis to the population level, exploring a spectrum of inter-strain interactions ranging from strict competition to independence. We find that the same framework explains why either aggressive or moderate treatment approaches can minimize resistance."

The model includes both wild-type (drug-sensitive; DS) bacteria and drug-resistant (DR) bacteria which arise by some presumably rare mechanism from the drug-sensitive type. This mechanism could be single-point mutation, acquisition of resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer, or another mechanism (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lipsitch and Samore, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">zur Wiesch et al., 2011</a>). While we do not explictly model these differences, we note that the mechanisms of resistance and their probabilities affect the relative importance of de novo resistance compared to pre-existing resistance circulating in a population (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lipsitch and Samore, 2002</a>). In our model, each strain initiates an immune response which follows density-dependent kinetics. Bacteria grow in a resource-dependent manner and have a death rate which increases under higher antibiotic concentrations. Antibiotics enter the system and degrade at a constant rate. The DR strain, by definition, has a higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) than the DS strain and is assumed to have a slower growth rate reflecting fitness costs associated with mutation or acquisition of resistance genes. The phrase \u2018minimum inhibitory concentration\u2019 parallels the language in <a href=\"#bib1\">Ankomah and Levin (2014)</a>; the MIC is the value of antibiotic <i>A</i> at which the growth rate with the drug is half its baseline value (when <i>A</i> = 0). The strain interactions in the model are complex: strains compete for resources, and each strain can suppress the other by triggering a host immune response. Thus, we expect the strains to be under fairly strong competition. However, the DS strain also benefits the DR strain as DR is generated from the DS population through acquired resistance."

To incorporate the possibility of stochastic die-off of the DR population when its density is very low, the growth rate is 0 when the density is less than 30 cells/ml. Not allowing for stochastic die-off might allow resistant strains to enjoy an unrealistic advantage in the model due to its deterministic nature. Here, 30 cells/ml is approximately 10<sup>\u22128</sup> times the maximum bacterial load, though this varies with the parameter choice.

If treatment is negatively correlated with resistance, then more treatment results in less resistance and an aggressive approach is best. Conversely, if the correlation is positive, then treatment drives increases in resistance, and a moderate approach is best (from a resistance standpoint). Accordingly, parameter sets in which resistance levels were negatively (<i>S</i> &lt; \u22120.7) or positively (<i>S</i> &gt; 0.7) correlated with antibiotic dosage as determined by the Spearman correlation <i>S</i> were classed as \u2018aggressive is best\u2019 or \u2018moderate is best\u2019; other results were classed as neutral.

At one of the continuum, we posit that distinct pathogens may be entirely independent of each other, not interacting directly or indirectly (e.g., through immune modulation or resource competition). In this case, infection with one strain does not affect infection or recovery with the other strain. At the other end of the continuum, very similar strains of the same pathogen are likely to be competing for hosts. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> illustrates two models, one with strict competition and one with independence."

The bifurcation analysis illustrates competitive exclusion: whichever strain has the higher <i>R</i>0 excludes the other. In both cases, some resistance is present when the sensitive strain is present, due to acquisition of resistance, for example, through mutation. Consequently, the \u20181-only\u2019 region of the plot has some strain 2 at very low prevalence. In contrast, if the strains are not competing (bottom row), including not competing for hosts, hosts must be able to harbor both infections (duals, <i>D</i>).

In models where dual infection cannot occur, there is an implicit assumption of very strong competition between strains. Dually infected individuals may also be again re-infected with a single strain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lipsitch et al., 2009</a>). Clearance terms (with recovery <i>u</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> and <i>u</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>) are modulated with the similarity coefficient, <i>c</i>, to ensure that the model has independent interactions when <i>c</i> = 0 and neutral null dynamics when <i>c</i> = 1 (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). Transmission rates are <i>\u03b2</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> and <i>\u03b2</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>, recovery rates are <i>u</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> and <i>u</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>, and we assume that over the time frame of the simulation the population does not change; we scale it to 1 so that <i>S</i> = 1 \u2212 <i>X</i> \u2212 <i>Y</i> \u2212 <i>D</i>. The forces of infection <i>F</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> and <i>F</i><sub><i>y</i></sub> contain a contribution from both singly and dually infected hosts such that when the strains are different, dually infected hosts contribute as much as singly infected ones, and when they are very similar, each strain contributes half what a singly infected host would (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lipsitch et al., 2009</a>). Treatment <i>T</i> ranges from 0 to 1 (where the DS strain is eliminated) and has several effects. Primarily, it cures the sensitive strain by reducing its duration of infection 1/<i>u</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>. Individuals with a resistant strain (<i>Y</i>) who are given treatment are partially protected (<i>\u03ba</i><sub><i>t</i></sub>) from re-infection with the sensitive strain. Dually infected individuals given treatment have the drug-sensitive portion of their infection cured at an increased rate <i>u</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> due to treatment, but their resistant infection is not cured."

Naturally, the result depends strongly on the parameter choice. We also vary one parameter at a time, keeping others fixed, and examine the trajectories (<a href=\"#fig9\">Appendix figures 2, 3</a>). The next approach is to examine, over all simulations simultaneously, how the outcome depends on each parameter by stratifying the outcomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

When the DR strain has a lower growth rate (LamR), an aggressive policy is more likely best because more of the DR strain's population arises through resistance acquisition from the DS population. In this case, reducing the DS strain also reduces DR. Conversely, when \u039b<sub><i>R</i></sub> (LamR) is high the DR strain is a more robust competitor and a moderate policy is more frequently best. Similarly, when the DR strain has a low MIC (mR), it is a less robust competitor. In this case, an aggressive policy is more frequently best than when mR is high (second panel). The third panel shows that when the immune system is strong (high <i>k</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>), an aggressive policy is more frequently best, because again more of the DR population increases are driven by acquisition from DS, due to immune suppression of DR growth. A plot with <i>\u03b7</i> on the horizontal axis is very similar to this one. Finally, the right plot shows that when the DS growth rate (LamS) is low, an aggressive strategy is more often best to minimize resistance; this depends on the ability of therapy to prevent the emergence of resistance."

There is strong opportunity for competition between strains encoded in the model; competition plays out through shared resources which may be limiting as well as through the triggering of an immune response that suppresses both strains equally. Both of these effects occur when bacterial populations are large. However, the initial appearance of resistance also depends critically on the presence of drug-sensitive organisms. Altering both the strength of competition and the dependence of the DR strain on the DS progenitor population determines whether or not such competition is <i>effective</i>. In particular, effective competition naturally requires a DR strain that has the capacity to be a robust competitor to the DS progenitor. This can be achieved in two ways: it can maintain a strong growth capacity in the presence of antibiotic treatment or immune pressure, or it can face an immune system that is not particularly strong. Our exploration of the parameter space uncovered both of these mechanisms. These findings are not an artifact of the model structure, and indeed they will likely occur in any model that includes de novo appearance of resistant strains by mutation or acquisition of resistance determinants by drug-sensitive organisms, and where resistant strains can then compete for resources with their drug-sensitive cousins."

This should capture both direct and indirect effects. Quantifying effective competition is challenging because either strain may affect the other over short or long time frames and because different ways to decrease one strain have different effects. From the second equation of (1), the direct effect of a decrease in <i>B</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> on the immediate growth of the resistant strain is simply the change in the acquisition term (<i>\u03bcB</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>). If the other terms are small, this term can make the difference between net growth and net decline of resistant cells. The indirect effects are more difficult to determine; a decrease in <i>B</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> will mean more available resource and reduced recruitment of immune cells which will have onward effects. We made a step towards quantifying effective competition as follows. We numerically solved the system, obtaining values of each variable through time. We decreased <i>B</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> and computed the predicted value of <i>B</i><sub><i>r</i></sub> two time steps later, using Euler's method, the derivatives in (1) and the time steps defined by the adaptive ODE solver. We did this (separately) at each time point and averaged the fractional change in <i>B</i><sub><i>r</i></sub> due to a 5% change in <i>B</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> over the portion of the trajectory where <i>B</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> &gt; 10<sup>5</sup>. We do this only in the untreated case, for each value of the parameters we sampled. This captures only the immediate indirect effects (occurring in the next two small time steps) and the intervention we made (reducing <i>B</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> when dosage is 0) is not the same as treatment. Nevertheless, this formulation of effective competition is a good predictor of whether treatment, when added, increases resistance. We used it to classify whether treatment would increase or decrease resistance, and found that the classification worked well, with an area under the receiver\u2013operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94 (the theoretical maximum is 1, and a classifier that guesses randomly has AUC of 0.5).

Independence means that even a relatively unfit strain can be transmitted in the population, despite the presence of a more fit strain, because when strains are independent they can each super-infect hosts already infected with the other strain, and they can be transmitted from those with dual infection (if these cannot happen then the strains cannot be independent; rather, they would compete for hosts and/or for infectivity).

Even where this does not occur at all (<i>r</i> = 0), successful treatment of individuals drives population-level resistance when strains are competing. Consider the within-host model in the regime where aggressive treatment minimizes resistance, for example, low DR growth \u039b<sub><i>r</i></sub> or a strong immune system, or high rate of acquisition of resistance. Individuals treated successfully are not susceptible to, or infectious with, the sensitive strain. At the between-host level, though, they may remain susceptible to a circulating resistant strain, which now has more susceptible hosts available than the sensitive strain. Treatment (reducing <i>R</i><sub>01</sub>) moves the system to the left on the invasion plot (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), increasing resistance if there is effective competition at the between-host level."

In these settings, the benefits to the DR population which accrue from the acquisition of resistance from DS outweigh the costs of competition from a larger DS population. In contrast, a moderate dosing policy is preferred when the DR strain is a fit enough competitor that acquisition of resistance plays a sufficiently small role in the DR population dynamics. Here, the cost of competition from the DS population outweighs the benefit of additional DR bacteria appearing through acquired resistance. Both modes occur in models containing acquisition of resistance and competition, and a small change in parameters can shift models from one mode to the other. Understanding why previous models and theory have differed in support of aggressive (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ehrlich, 1913</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Knudsen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wiuff et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tam et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">D'Agata et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ankomah and Levin, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2014</a>) and moderate (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Roode et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wargo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gullberg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huijben et al., 2013</a>) approaches requires evaluating both structural assumptions and parameter choices (<a href=\"#bib39\">Spicknall et al., 2013</a>) as these together affect the strength of effective competition between DR and DS strains. We have used a comprehensive approach to exploring these assumptions and have begun the process of defining measures of <i>effective competition</i> to predict whether moderate or aggressive treatment minimizes resistance."

In <a href=\"#bib1\">Ankomah and Levin (2014)</a>, the model structure incorporates complex interactions between strains, allowing for many facets of competition to be explored. At their chosen parameter values, however, there is little effective competition between DR and DS strains and they found an aggressive policy to be best. In a recent work by <a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al. (2014)</a>, DR strains had two alleles with no onward fitness evolution, little in-host competition, and low DR fitness; consequently, they also found that an aggressive approach would be best. Another recent model (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gomes et al., 2013</a>) assumed that there was competition for resources at high bacterial populations, and concluded that this competition could play a role in suppression of resistant strains. Work by <a href=\"#bib16\">Geli et al. (2012)</a> explored different ecological dynamics and found that strong immunity supports an aggressive policy, but that selection was most intensive at intermediate strengths of treatment in chronic infections (<a href=\"#bib16\">Geli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kouyos et al., 2014</a>). <a href=\"#bib18\">Gullberg et al.

We find that even in a system where aggressive approaches are most frequently best (the within-host model, based on <a href=\"#bib1\">Ankomah and Levin (2014)</a>), a moderate approach can be preferred if the DR strain is slightly more fit and the environment is slightly more permissive; in this case, inter-strain competition mechanisms, which are always present, are more effective. Likewise, at the between-host level where we might expect herd-level competition effects to play out, we find that even where competition mechanisms are strong, an aggressive approach may be best of one or both strains have a low basic reproduction number or if the rate of acquisition of resistance is high. Both of these factors limit the effective competition."

The extent to which these aspects dominate the fact that resistance is also driven by de novo acquisition, and hence benefits from high DS population levels, will depend on the acquisition rate and mechanism (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lipsitch and Samore, 2002</a>) as well as on the degree of effective competition. Furthermore, models have typically reflected competition for host resources or via a carrying capacity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Geli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gomes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ankomah and Levin, 2014</a>), such that competition takes place at high bacterial populations.

Consider, for example, an immune-competent individual initially harboring a drug-susceptible infection free of any (or many) sporadically resistant isolates. An aggressive approach may well be preferred for this individual. However, if there is a fit resistant strain circulating in the community, then this policy can drive substantial resistance at the population level (e.g., by selectively suppressing the DS strain, making hosts susceptible to re-infections only with the DR strain), even if it does not increase the risk of acquiring resistance in any <i>individual</i> given treatment. Consequently, an aggressive approach might well be best at the individual level while still driving resistance over longer time frames. An aggressive approach may also diminish in utility over time if DR strains become fitter through selection, if they begin to circulate widely and compete with DS strains (<a href=\"#bib46\">zur Wiesch et al., 2011</a>)."

Here, we note that such neutrality <i>is</i> competition. The \u2018no coexistence for free\u2019 directive can be reframed: we expect identical strains to compete. The extent of competition is a key driver of how the balance between multiple strains changes in response to interventions; if we are to use models to understand these responses, we must be clear about the mechanisms and the extent of effective competition between strains."

These types of controlled experiments have been valuable for identifying conditions under which such direct competition effects are likely to manifest within individual hosts. Identifying data that would reveal the conditions under which we would expect competition between DS and DR strains at the community level is clearly more challenging. The scale and the timing at which we would expect to observe the effects of intraspecific competition will likely differ by pathogen type. Similar to studies of vaccines or other interventions in which indirect effects are important to consider, community-randomized trials are the most promising design, but the expense and logistics of such trials for considering different antibiotic dosing strategies may be prohibitive."

Previously (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lipsitch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Colijn et al., 2010</a>), we argued that neutrality is required in order for a model of multiple strains to make biological sense when the strains are identical: in this case, it should not matter which strain an individual or sub-group is infected with. The dynamics of the total prevalence should depend only on the numbers of hosts infected. Furthermore, each strain should have the same ability to cause new infections and should not be comparatively advantaged or disadvantaged by being rare. Otherwise, an arbitrary re-labeling of some cases (all of whom have identical strains by assumption) alters which of these cases seed new infections."

First, if dual infection can result from re-infection, then re-infection must also be able to out-compete one of the strains in a dually infected host, leading back to single infection. Otherwise, dual infection can protect a rare strain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lipsitch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Colijn et al., 2010</a>), as was also noted recently in <a href=\"#bib19\">Hansen and Day (2014)</a>. Second, in the limit in which the infections are identical, recovery from one and not the other is not logical; dually infected hosts recover back to susceptible. Finally, dually infected hosts contribute the same <i>total</i> infectiousness to the force of infection, divided equally between the strains (This assumption can be relaxed while preserving neutrality, but doing so requires also modeling hosts with multiple single infections [<a href=\"#bib31\">Lipsitch et al., 2009</a>].). We found (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lipsitch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Colijn et al., 2010</a>) that models that reduce to this neutral interaction when strains are identical also do not promote coexistence of diverse strains."

Different strains might inhabit very different niches within hosts, trigger different immune responses, act over different time periods, be transmitted through different routes, and so on. When strains are independent, new infection events do not displace existing strains, but add to them. Hosts clear strains independently, so that when a dually infected host recovers from one strain, they remain (singly) infected with the other. Finally, dually infected hosts are equally infectious with each strain as they would be if they didn't have the other strain. These requirements also constrain the equations of a model representing the two strains."

This was used to model the possibility of stochastic die-off of low populations of DR, and incidentally also prevents growth from only a fraction of a cell, which would otherwise be possible when using a continuous model to approximate a discrete variable. Parameters were generated uniformly over the ranges shown, except for <i>\u03bc</i> in the within-host model.
