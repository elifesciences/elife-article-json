Rab GTPases are central for autophagy but their regulation especially through the activity of Rab GEFs remains largely elusive. We employed a RNAi screen simultaneously monitoring different populations of autophagosomes and identified 34 out of 186 Rab GTPase, GAP and GEF family members as potential autophagy regulators, amongst them SMCR8. SMCR8 uses overlapping binding regions to associate with C9ORF72 or with a C9ORF72-ULK1 kinase complex holo-assembly, which function in maturation and formation of autophagosomes, respectively. While focusing on the role of SMCR8 during autophagy initiation, we found that kinase activity and gene expression of ULK1 are increased upon SMCR8 depletion. The latter phenotype involved association of SMCR8 with the ULK1 gene locus. Global mRNA expression analysis revealed that SMCR8 regulates transcription of several other autophagy genes including WIPI2. Collectively, we established SMCR8 as multifaceted negative autophagy regulator."

Rab GTPases are central for autophagy but their regulation especially through the activity of Rab GEFs remains largely elusive. We employed a RNAi screen simultaneously monitoring different populations of autophagosomes and identified 34 out of 186 Rab GTPase, GAP and GEF family members as potential autophagy regulators, amongst them SMCR8. SMCR8 uses overlapping binding regions to associate with C9ORF72 or with a C9ORF72-ULK1 kinase complex holo-assembly, which function in maturation and formation of autophagosomes, respectively. While focusing on the role of SMCR8 during autophagy initiation, we found that kinase activity and gene expression of ULK1 are increased upon SMCR8 depletion. The latter phenotype involved association of SMCR8 with the ULK1 gene locus. Global mRNA expression analysis revealed that SMCR8 regulates transcription of several other autophagy genes including WIPI2. Collectively, we established SMCR8 as multifaceted negative autophagy regulator."

The intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of Rab GTPases is enhanced by Rab GAPs (GTPase activating protein), while Rab GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) induce the GTP-bound state. Active Rab GTPases recruit effector proteins that mediate vesicular budding, transport, targeting, tethering and fusion (see <a href=\"#bib31\">Hutagalung and Novick (2011)</a> for review)."

                        "text": "Autophagy is an intracellular quality and quantity control pathway during which diverse cytosolic cargoes such as damaged or surplus organelles, aggregated or misfolded proteins and pathogens are engulfed by double membrane structures coined autophagosomes and delivered for bulk lysosomal degradation upon fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. This pathway originates from established membrane compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, where precursor structures and early autophagosome intermediates form. Phagophores and omegasomes are then elongated by vesicular input and give rise to autophagosomes upon their closure. At the molecular level, autophagy is initiated via inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), causing formation of an active ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) complex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Jung et al., 2010</a>). The ULK1 complex comprises the kinase ULK1, FIP200/RB1CC1 (focal adhesion kinase interacting protein of 200 kDa/RB1 inducible coiled-coil1) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hara et al., 2008</a>), ATG13 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ganley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hara et al., 2008</a>) and ATG101 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hosokawa et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mercer et al., 2009</a>). Active ULK1 phosphorylates all of its complex partners as well as subunits of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) class III complex, namely Beclin1, Atg14L1 and hVps34 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jung et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Russell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Egan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Park et al., 2016</a>). Phosphorylation of PI3K subunits induces generation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) on the nascent phagophore (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jaber et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burman and Ktistakis, 2010</a>), which subsequently recruits PI3P-binding proteins including WIPI2 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Polson et al., 2010</a>). Consecutively, WIPI2 directs the ubiquitin-like conjugation machinery consisting of the ATG5~ATG12-ATG16L1 complex, ATG3, ATG7 and ATG10, to the elongated phagophore through association with ATG16L1 and hence, induces conjugation of mammalian ATG8s (LC3s and GABARAPs) to phosphatidylethanolamine (<a href=\"#bib60\">Polson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dooley et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Proikas-Cezanne et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Tanida et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Weidberg et al., 2010</a>). Mammalian ATG8 proteins regulate cargo selection and autophagosome maturation through association with ATG8 family interaction motif (AIM, also known as LC3-interacting region (LIR)) containing proteins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Behrends et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</a>) engaging separate, independent functions (<a href=\"#bib82\">Weidberg et al., 2010</a>). While LC3s (LC3A, LC3B, LC3C) are required for phagophore elongation, GABARAPs (GABARAP, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2) are indispensable for autophagosome maturation (<a href=\"#bib82\">Weidberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Joachim et al., 2015</a>). In addition, either group also operates in autophagy independent processes (<a href=\"#bib71\">Stadel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Genau et al., 2015</a>). Finally, fusion of closed autophagosomes with lysosomes is promoted by recruitment of SNARE proteins such as STX17 and autophagosomal cargo is degraded (<a href=\"#bib33\">Itakura et al., 2012</a>)."

For example, out of 36 TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain containing Rab GAPs 11 and 14 were found to inhibit starvation induced autophagy upon overexpression and to associate with human ATG8s, respectively, revealing TBC1D14 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lamb et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Longatti et al., 2012</a>) and TBC1D5 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Popovic et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Popovic and Dikic, 2014</a>). Furthermore, several additional Rab GTPases and GAPs have been studied intensively including RAB7, TBC1D25, RAB33B, TBC1D2, RAB3GAP1 and RAB3GAP2 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Itoh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carroll et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Spang et al., 2014</a>).

Very recently, several reports detected SMCR8 in complex with C9ORF72 and WDR41 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amick et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sellier et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sullivan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Xiao et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Blokhuis et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Ugolino et al., 2016</a>). This complex was further identified as RAB39B GEF, which promotes autophagic clearance of aggregated proteins (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sellier et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2016</a>). Additionally, SMCR8 was implicated in mTORC1 regulation, lysosomal quality control and ULK1 modulation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amick et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sullivan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sellier et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Ugolino et al., 2016</a>). However, we provide evidence for the existence of a holo-assembly consisting of all ULK1 and SMCR8 complex subunits. Furthermore, SMCR8 depletion decreased phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates but markedly enhanced ULK1 kinase activity. Unexpectedly, we found that SMCR8 repressed ULK1 gene expression independent of its GEF complex partners and regulated transcription of several other autophagy genes. Hence, we identified SMCR8 as versatile negative autophagy regulator."

Since the involvement of these components in autophagy has not been systematically studied, we performed an unbiased, focused, image-based RNAi screen to identify Rab GTPases as well as their GEFs and GAPs that regulate autophagy. To comprehensively monitor the autophagy pathway at endogenous levels we first established parallel immunostaining in 384 well format for several autophagy markers (i.e. WIPI2, ATG12, LC3B, GABARAP and STX17), covering early autophagosome intermediates, autophagosomes and late autophagosomes. Using pooled siRNAs individually targeting each marker we confirmed antibody specificity in immunofluorescence (IF) and immunoblot analyses (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>). IF samples were measured on an automated confocal spinning disk microscope and spot numbers and their intensity were quantified and integrated using algorithm-based image analysis software. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Raptor or RAB7A significantly increased spot number and integrated spot signal (ISS) for all five markers while depletion of ATG12 or PIK3C3 significantly decreased the ISS across our marker panel (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). Knockdown efficiency of these controls was confirmed by immunoblot or RT-qPCR analysis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H</a>). Screenability of our autophagy markers was assessed using the z\u2019-factor, which evaluates the difference between the positive and negative control as well as the standard deviation. Importantly, z\u2019-factors for all five markers were above 0.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating excellent screening conditions."

Reverse siRNA transfection of U2OS cells was followed by fixation, parallel endogenous immunolabeling of all five established autophagosome markers and automated IF analysis. After normalization of spot numbers and ISS to non-targeting siRNA control (sicon), siRNA pools differing by more than two standard deviations for LC3B, GABARAP and STX17 or by more than three standard deviations for WIPI2 and ATG12 were selected as candidates. This primary screen yielded between 42 and 70 candidate siRNA pools per autophagosome marker that showed increased spot parameters while overall only up to 10 spot decreasing candidate siRNA pools were detected. Candidates of every autophagosome marker were ranked according to the maximal increase or decrease in spot numbers as well as ISS and the top ten altering siRNA pools for each individual marker plus those siRNA pools scoring for more than one marker were selected for deconvolution resulting in a total of 71 candidates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

After dataset normalization to sicon, a toxicity filter was applied excluding all siRNAs that caused broad variation in the number of cells or in the intensity or size of their nucleus or cytoplasm. To successfully pass deconvolution, candidates had to fulfill the standard deviation criterion applied above for three out of four individual siRNAs or for two out of three siRNAs in case one siRNA was removed due to cytotoxicity. In total, our deconvolution screen validated 34 candidate genes whose depletion resulted in an increase in spot numbers or ISS across our marker panel (11 for WIPI2, 15 for ATG12, four for LC3B, four for GABARAP and 15 for STX17) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2A</a>). Notably, none of the primary screen candidates whose knockdown decreased spot parameters passed our stringent deconvolution criteria. The detection of genes with known function in autophagy like RAB7A, RAB11B and several TRAPP components validated our screening results. As expected knockdown of RAB7A only increased spot parameters of late autophagy markers (LC3B, GABARAP and STX17). In addition, we identified several genes known to be involved in membrane trafficking such as TBC1D9B and RAB36 as well as completely enigmatic genes like DENND2C and TBC1D8 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

Knockdown with two individual siRNAs per candidate gene was performed in basal (DMSO), inducing (Torin1) and blocking (BafilomycinA1 (BafA1)) autophagy conditions prior to fixation, immunostaining and image analysis. While DENND2C, MADD, RAB27A, RAB27B, RAB36, SMCR8 or TBC1D8 depleted cells showed significantly increased spot numbers across several markers during basal autophagy as observed in our primary and deconvolution screens, depletion of either of these candidates led to a further increase in spot formation for at least one marker compared to sicon when cells were treated with Torin1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Following cell lysis and HA-immunoprecipitation (IP), HA peptide eluted immune complexes were subjected to trypsin digestion, desalting and analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). High-confidence candidate interacting proteins (HCIPs) were identified by processing of mass spectral data using the CompPASS platform (<a href=\"#bib3\">Behrends et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sowa et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with the role of RAB27A and RAB27B in melanosome transport (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fukuda, 2013</a>), several components of this pathway (SYTL1, SYTL2, SYTL4, SYTL5, MYRIP and EXPH5) were among the HCIPs of both Rab27 proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). Further on, the autophagy regulators ATG2B (<a href=\"#bib79\">Velikkakath et al., 2012</a>), SLC33A1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pehar et al., 2012</a>), VMP1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gilabert et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Molejon et al., 2013</a>) and TM9SF1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">He et al., 2009</a>) were detected as RAB27A HCIPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In addition, RAB27B was associated with its known GEF MADD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which itself retrieved several kinases, amongst them the TFEB interactor PPP3CB (<a href=\"#bib50\">Medina et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Importantly, IP of VMP1 and ATG2B with RAB27A was independently confirmed by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Moreover, FYCO1 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pankiv and Johansen, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pankiv et al., 2010</a>) and the PIP2-binding protein ARHGAP26 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Moreau et al., 2012</a>) were identified as HCIPs of DENND2C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), while RAB36 and TBC1D8 did not associate with known autophagy regulators (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F and G</a>). Finally, the interactome of SMCR8 revealed members of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery (FAM96B, CIAO1, GLRX5 and NUBPL) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Stehling et al., 2012</a>), the lysosome maturation and trafficking BLOC-2 complex subunit HPS6 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bultema et al., 2012</a>), the Rab GEF C9ORF72 and its cofactor WDR41 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sellier et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Xiao et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amick et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Blokhuis et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Ugolino et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Levine et al., 2013</a>) as well as the ULK1 complex component FIP200 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Behrends et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sullivan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sellier et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2016</a>) as prominent HCIPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Association of SMCR8 with the latter three was recently linked to autophagy modulation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sellier et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sullivan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amick et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2016</a>).

Indeed, the ULK1 complex members ULK1, FIP200 and ATG13 as well as C9ORF72 associated with tagged SMCR8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>), while endogenous SMCR8 was retrieved with HA-tagged ATG13 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Importantly, the association of SMCR8 with ULK1 and FIP200 was confirmed at endogenous levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Next, we addressed whether the association of SMCR8 and C9ORF72 with each other or with the ULK1 complex is altered upon autophagy induction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F and G</a>). Consistent with recent work, starvation or Torin1 treatment did not affect the binding between SMCR8 and C9ORF72 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amick et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2016</a>). Intriguingly, IP of overexpressed HA-tagged or endogenous SMCR8 revealed an increased FIP200 binding to SMCR8 upon autophagy induction while SMCR8 interaction with ATG13 was reduced. Furthermore, C9ORF72 association with ULK1 complex components was remarkably sensitive to nutrient starvation as their interaction was almost undetectable in fed cells and increased substantially upon starvation. However, binding of SMCR8 to ULK1, FIP200 and ATG13 was more pronounced in fed cells compared to C9ORF72-ULK1 complex association in starved cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Together, these results indicate that binding of SMCR8 to C9ORF72 and the ULK1 complex is differentially regulated."

                                "text": "To map the binding regions of ULK1 complex members and C9ORF72 on SMCR8 we employed a panel of cells transiently expressing HA-tagged full-length SMCR8 or fragments thereof followed by HA-IP and immunoblot (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>) or MS analysis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>). Notably, SMCR8 fragments were designed in consideration of the domain boundaries of the tripartite DENN module, which is composed of the N-terminal u-DENN/longin, the central DENN, and the C-terminal d-DENN domains (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) and bioinformatically predicted secondary structure elements (<a href=\"#bib13\">Drozdetskiy et al., 2015</a>). This binding analysis revealed that the SMCR8 fragment spanning amino acids (aa) 120\u2013320 was required and sufficient for the binding of ATG13 and immunoprecipitated even more endogenous ATG13 than full-length SMCR8. Conversely, association of FIP200 and ULK1 with SMCR8 was enhanced when the entire N-terminal fragment encompassing aa 1\u2013700 was used and was dependent on the ATG13 binding site since further truncations of the N-terminus (compare fragments 271\u2013700 and 1\u2013700) reduced binding of FIP200 and ULK1 to SMCR8. As SMCR8 fragment 1\u2013700 retrieved increased amounts of endogenous ULK1 and FIP200 compared to fragment 1\u2013500, the region in between aa 500\u2013700 of SMCR8 seemed particularly important for binding to ULK1 and FIP200. Furthermore, association of FIP200 and ULK1 with the SMCR8 fragment 1\u2013700 was increased compared to full-length SMCR8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>), indicating a potential inhibitory role of the C-terminal region of SMCR8 spanning aa 701\u2013937, which itself did not interact with any of the tested binding partners (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). For C9ORF72, a SMCR8 fragment consisting of aa 1\u2013400 was necessary and sufficient to mediate binding. Further N-terminal or C-terminal clipping of the SMCR8 fragment 1\u2013400 completely abolished binding of C9ORF72. Interestingly, SMCR8 fragment 1\u2013400 showed strongly reduced interaction with ATG13 compared to fragment 1\u2013320, suggesting that the region encompassing aa 320\u2013400 of SMCR8 has an inhibitory and promoting role in the association with ATG13 and C9ORF72, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). Since these results provide evidence for tight association of SMCR8 with ULK1 complex members and C9ORF72 via overlapping binding regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), we examined whether ATG13 and C9ORF72 compete for binding to SMCR8. However, increasing amounts of exogenously expressed GFP-tagged ATG13 or C9ORF72 were not able to outcompete C9ORF72 or ATG13 from SMCR8 immune complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and E</a>). Further on, SMCR8 overexpression or depletion did not alter association between ULK1 complex components (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F and G</a>)."

                                "text": "To start addressing whether SMCR8 associates with its binding partners in two distinct complexes or in one holo-assembly, we subjected eluted immune complexes of exogenously expressed HA-tagged SMCR8, C9ORF72, ATG13 and ULK1 to Native PAGE followed by immunoblot or MS analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Together with WDR41 but in the absence of any ULK1 complex component, SMCR8 and C9ORF72 formed a stable complex whose migration in Native PAGE peaked between 480 and 720 kDa. As reported <a href=\"#bib51\">Mercer et al. (2009)</a>, ATG13 associated with ATG101 and formed a similar size complex that likewise lacked FIP200 and ULK1, the latter of which also existed unbound by its complex partners. However, all SMCR8-binding partners, namely C9ORF72, WDR41 as well as the ULK1 complex were also present in a second higher molecular weight assembly that migrated between 720 and 1200 kDa. Complementary size exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments of whole cell lysates followed by immunoblot analysis confirmed the distribution of the ULK1 complex in a high molecular weight assembly above 1 MDa (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Accordingly, SMCR8 was detected in fractions between 440 and 669 kDa in a SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41 complex and above 669 kDa in a SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41-ULK1 complex holo-assembly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Notably, specificity of the anti-SMCR8 antibody was verified with SEC of whole cell lysates from SMCR8 knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In agreement with our co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), SMCR8 depletion left the ULK1 complex distribution unchanged (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To gain more insights into the SMCR8-C9ORF72-ULK1 holo-complex, we combined IP of HA-tagged ATG13 with SEC and MS analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The size fractionation pattern of eluted ATG13 immunoprecipitates revealed three distinct populations of the common SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41-ULK1 complex assembly, which peaked at approximately 500 kDa, 1 MDa and several MDa, respectively, and might represent monomeric and multimeric states of this holo-assembly as suggested previously for the ULK1 complex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hosokawa et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">K\u00f6finger et al., 2015</a>). Since autophagy induction resulted in enhanced interaction of SMCR8 and C9ORF72 with the ULK1 complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), we examined the fractionation pattern of these components in whole cell lysates or eluted immune complexes by SEC upon Torin1 treatment. However, we could not observe major changes in the distribution of the ULK1 complex components, SMCR8 or C9ORF72 under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). In summary, our results indicate that SMCR8 binds C9ORF72 and WDR41 to form a stable complex that is joined by the ULK1 complex to form an even larger combined assembly."

Given that SMCR8 knockdown increased spots of early and late autophagosome markers across our different screening efforts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013C</a>), we performed an additional series of experiments to unequivocally establish a role of SMCR8 in formation or maturation of autophagosomes. Briefly, we analyzed cells stably expressing RFP-GFP-LC3B through which autophagosomes can be distinguished from autolysosomes due to loss of pH-sensitive GFP fluorescence in autolysosomes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kimura et al., 2007</a>). Upon SMCR8 knockdown, we observed an increase in total number of spots (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>), which can result from enhanced formation of autophagosomes or from blockage of autophagosome maturation. Indicative of the latter is that the ratio of autophagosomes to autolysosomes in SMCR8 depleted cells (at least for siSMCR8#20) showed a considerable shift in favor of autophagosomes. Furthermore, treatment of control cells with BafA1 increased the ratio and the total number of spots as expected (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). Additional loss of SMCR8 slightly aggrandized this increase, suggesting a role of SMCR8 in formation of autophagosomes. At last, Torin1 treated cells depleted of SMCR8 further accumulated spots, which is again an indication for blockage of autophagosome maturation. Together, we concluded that SMCR8 exerts two independent functions in autophagy. On one hand SMCR8 represses autophagosome formation and on the other hand SMCR8 promotes autophagosome maturation."

                                "text": "Subsequently, we focused our efforts on addressing how SMCR8 affects autophagosome formation. Given the fact that SMCR8 is part of the ULK1 complex, we examined the localization of ULK1 and FIP200 in cells lacking SMCR8. In addition, we also monitored the PI3P effector WIPI2 as surrogate for hVps34 activity, which is regulated by ULK1 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Russell et al., 2013</a>). Intriguingly, SMCR8 knockout (ko) cells displayed a significant increase in spot numbers of all three markers (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013D</a>). To test whether these spots indeed represent early autophagosome intermediates positive for both ULK1 and WIPI2, we monitored the subcellular distribution of both markers in SMCR8 depleted cells. Consistent with our results in SMCR8 knockout cells, loss of SMCR8 yielded significantly elevated numbers of ULK1 positive spots (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3E and F</a>). Conversely, but in agreement with our initial screening results, RNAi-mediated knockdown of SMCR8 was not sufficient to phenocopy the increase in WIPI2 positive spots observed in cells completely lacking SMCR8 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3E and F</a>). Importantly, colocalization of ULK1 with WIPI2 increased about 2-fold upon SMCR8 depletion in basal and Torin1-treated conditions (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3E and G</a>), suggesting an enhanced formation of early autophagosome intermediates in the absence of SMCR8."

                                "text": "To gain further insights into the mechanism of SMCR8-mediated autophagy initiation restriction, we examined the effect of SMCR8 depletion on ULK1 kinase activity. Intriguingly, in both Torin1 and control treated cells phosphorylation of the ULK1 substrate ATG13 at serine (S) 318 was substantially increased upon SMCR8 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), while lack of C9ORF72 or WDR41 caused the opposite effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B and C</a>). Monitoring S29 phosphorylation of ATG14, which represents another substrate of ULK1, independently confirmed the inhibitory function of SMCR8 on ULK1 kinase activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), whereas absence of C9ORF72 left S29 phosphorylation unchanged (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Since ULK1 kinase activity can be regulated via several upstream kinases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alers et al., 2012</a>), we examined whether SMCR8 mediated repression of ULK1 kinase activity is dependent on mTORC1 or AMPK. As expected, Torin1 treatment completely blocked mTORC1-dependent ULK1 S757 phosphorylation and led to concurrently increased phosphorylation of ATG13 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C and F</a> (compare sicon DMSO to sicon Torin1)). Similarly, glucose starvation increased AMPK-dependent ULK1 S317 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Upon SMCR8 depletion, mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 at S757 was completely abolished after treatment with Torin1 but enhanced in control cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Unexpectedly, absence of SMCR8 increased ULK1 protein levels more than 3-fold compared to control cells. Densitometric analysis of the ratio between phosphorylated and total ULK1 protein levels revealed that S757 phosphorylation is marginally decreased upon SMCR8 knockdown. A similar phenotype was also observed for the mTORC1 substrate S6K but not for 4EBP1. In contrast, SMCR8 depletion did not change AMPK-dependent ULK1 S317 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Since ULK1 protein levels were elevated in SMCR8 depleted cells, we tested the effect of ULK1 overexpression on ATG13 phosphorylation. Increasing the amounts of ULK1 by simple overexpression slightly induced ATG13 S318 phosphorylation, while SMCR8 knockdown caused a more than 3-fold increase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>), suggesting that SMCR8 imposes an inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of ULK1 in addition to controlling ULK1 protein abundance. Together with the observation that phosphorylation of ATG13 is higher in untreated cells depleted of SMCR8 than in Torin1 stimulated sicon transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), these results indicate that SMCR8-mediated regulation of ULK1 kinase activity comprises mTORC1-dependent and -independent traits."

However, in contrast to ULK1, FIP200 and ATG13 protein levels remained unchanged upon SMCR8 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Importantly, re-expression of full-length SMCR8 was able to rescue SMCR8 depleted cells from elevated ULK1 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Next, we investigated whether SMCR8 regulates ULK1 protein abundance in concert with its binding partners C9ORF72 and WDR41. However, ULK1 protein levels remained unchanged in cells lacking C9ORF72 or WDR41 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Thus, regulation of ULK1 protein abundance by SMCR8 seems independent of its function within the SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41 GEF complex. At last, we assessed whether the SMCR8 dependent increase in ULK1 protein levels is due to altered ULK1 gene expression. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that knockdown of SMCR8 caused elevated ULK1 mRNA levels, while FIP200 mRNA levels remained unchanged, consistent with constant FIP200 protein abundance upon SMCR8 depletion (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,D and E</a>). Collectively, our data supports a dual role of SMCR8 in regulating ULK1 at the level of gene expression and kinase activity."

Despite SMCR8 deletion, ULK1 protein levels again remained unchanged (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). For a time-resolved segmentation, the ULK1 protein abundance was monitored in absence of SMCR8 with a long-term siRNA knockdown experiment: First, 293 T cells were transfected with non-targeting or SMCR8 siRNA. After 2\u20133 days half of the cells were re-transfected with siRNA while the other half was harvested for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The same procedure was applied for several weeks.

Briefly, control cells and cells expressing full-length SMCR8 or N- or C-terminal fragments thereof (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>) were cross-linked prior to chromatin fragmentation and anti-HA-IP. Thereafter, DNA was isolated from anti-HA immunoprecipitated chromatin and analyzed by qPCR using primers that annealed to the ULK1 or FIP200 gene locus, respectively. Intriguingly, exogenous full-length SMCR8 was significantly enriched at the ULK1 gene locus, but not at the one of FIP200 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). While the N-terminal SMCR8 fragment 1\u2013700 did not show significant enrichment, the C-terminal SMCR8 fragment 701\u2013937 was sufficient for the engagement of SMCR8 at the ULK1 locus and in fact was even more effective in associating with the ULK1 gene locus than exogenous full-length SMCR8 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). To confirm these findings, we performed ChIP experiments with an anti-SMCR8 antibody and unraveled significant enrichment of endogenous SMCR8 at the ULK1 gene locus. This specific chromatin association was dramatically diminished upon SMCR8 depletion (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G and H</a>). In summary, SMCR8 inhibits gene expression of ULK1 dependent on its C-terminus."

Indeed, upon SMCR8 depletion the mRNA of 1059 genes were upregulated more than 1.3 fold, while 424 mRNAs showed reduced expression by more than 0.7 fold (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Functional annotation analysis of these regulated candidate genes revealed enrichment of components of ER stress response, translation, cell cycle and DNA damage response among several other gene ontology (GO) categories (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). Since autophagy proteins were not specifically enriched in our GO analysis, we manually curated the microarray data for mRNAs encoding proteins involved in autophagy, mTORC1 regulation and/or the lysosomal pathway (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). In this data set, we detected ULK1 and S6K (RPS6KB1) among the mRNAs whose expression increased upon SMCR8 depletion, thereby confirming our initial immunoblot findings (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Using RT-qPCR, we validated several mRNA expression changes in this subset of the microarray. For example, depletion of SMCR8 led to significantly reduced mRNA levels of ATF4 and LAMP1, while ATG3 and ATG7 remained unchanged as in the microarray analysis (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). Moreover, substantially increased mRNA levels were observed for LAMP2, S6K and WIPI2 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). The latter was also confirmed in another cell line (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Importantly, the increase or reduction in mRNA levels translated into the respective change in protein abundance in SMCR8 depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). Furthermore, subsequent ChIP experiments revealed association of HA-tagged full-length and the N-terminally truncated fragment 701\u2013937 of SMCR8 on the WIPI2 gene locus (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). As for the ULK1 gene locus these results were confirmed with anti-SMCR8 antibody at endogenous levels (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>). Hence, we established SMCR8 as transcriptional regulator for several autophagy genes."

Particular interesting is that ATG13 and C9ORF72 show differential binding to SMCR8 in the region spanning aa 320\u2013400. This raises the possibility that association of ATG13 (together with ULK1, FIP200 and ATG101) and C9ORF72 (together with WDR41) with SMCR8 is potentially distinctively regulated. Intriguingly, autophagy induction left the SMCR8 interaction with C9ORF72 unimpaired, while association of both with the ULK1 complex increased substantially. However, neither did ATG13 overexpression disrupt association between SMCR8 and C9ORF72, nor changed the ULK1 complex during SMCR8 overexpression or depletion. Together with our SEC and Native PAGE analysis, these data indicate the co-existence of a separate SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41 complex and a combined SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41-ULK1 complex holo-assembly, which might preferentially form after autophagy induction although we did not observe major changes in the holo-assembly composition upon Torin1 treatment."

For example, increased phosphorylation of ULK1 kinase substrates promotes autophagy initiation and elongation. In our study, we uncovered that SMCR8 depletion enhances ULK1-dependent ATG13 and ATG14 phosphorylation, while C9ORF72 knockdown surprisingly had the opposing effect on ATG13 and no effect on ATG14. Given that both are found associated with the ULK1 complex it is conceivable that ULK1 kinase activity regulation is due to direct binding of SMCR8 and/or C9ORF72 to ULK1 and/or its complex partners. However, SMCR8 overexpression or depletion does not disrupt association of ULK1 and ATG13 or induce changes in the ULK1 complex fractionation pattern. Since C9ORF72 recruits the ULK1 complex to the nascent phagophore (<a href=\"#bib80\">Webster et al., 2016</a>), the localization of the ULK1 complex could presumably also be linked to its activation. Another potential regulatory mechanism to control ULK1 kinase activity is ULK1 phosphorylation via upstream kinases such as mTORC1 and AMPK (<a href=\"#bib14\">Egan et al., 2011</a>). We observed a reduction in phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates ULK1 and S6K, which are simultaneously upregulated at the transcriptional level in SMCR8 knockdown cells. Notably, phosphorylation status of another mTORC1 substrate, 4EBP1, remained unchanged. Furthermore, AMPK kinase activity was unimpaired in respect to ULK1 phosphorylation. Together, these findings indicate that SMCR8 controls ULK1 activity via mTORC1 dependent and independent pathways. Further detailed studies in vitro are required to mechanistically dissect how SMCR8 and C9ORF72 modulate ULK1 kinase activity in a substrate-specific manner."

In addition, phosphorylation of SMCR8 could potentially regulate binding of SMCR8 to the ULK1 complex.

This phenotype was independent of C9ORF72 and required the C-terminal part of SMCR8 spanning aa 701\u2013937 as this fragment was almost exclusively localized to the nucleus and enriched at the ULK1 gene locus to a substantial higher level than full-length SMCR8. Since SMCR8 lacks a clear nuclear localization sequence or export signal, future functional analyses will need to address whether self-inhibitory and/or phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms regulate nuclear translocation of SMCR8. Similarly, SMCR8 directly associates with chromatin but does not contain a bioinformatically detectable DNA binding domain. Thus, it is likely that SMCR8 represses ULK1 gene expression through interaction with another chromatin-associated protein. Recently, STRaNDs were defined as novel group of non-DNA binding, cytoplasmic proteins, which shuttle into the nucleus and regulate gene expression through interaction with transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lu et al., 2016</a>). In this regard, potential STRaND cooperation partners of SMCR8 are ATF4, p53, FOXO3 and ZKSCAN3, which all regulate mRNA expression of ULK1 and several other autophagosomal and lysosomal proteins (<a href=\"#bib67\">Settembre et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chauhan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chua et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pietrocola et al., 2013</a>).

Interestingly, C9ORF72 was one of the validated candidates in our screen and recently implemented in RAB1A dependent recruitment of the ULK1 complex to the phagophore (<a href=\"#bib80\">Webster et al., 2016</a>). Consistently, RAB1A depletion decreased number of WIPI2 positive spots in our primary screen but did not fulfill our stringent standard deviation criterion to be included in the deconvolution screen. Concurrent with the SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41 complex possessing GEF activity towards RAB39B and thereby regulating autophagosome maturation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sellier et al., 2016</a>), we identified RAB39B as candidate in our primary screen. However, RAB39B was excluded from further analysis, since it was outranked by other candidates. While ULK1 kinase activity is regulated by both SMCR8 and C9ORF72, we found that ULK1 gene repression is seemingly independent of the SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41 GEF complex since ULK1 protein levels remained unchanged in cells lacking C9ORF72 or WDR41. Furthermore, the C-terminal fragment of SMCR8, which does not bind C9ORF72, was sufficient to associate with chromatin at the ULK1 and WIPI2 gene locus. Intriguingly, SMCR8 regulated gene expression of several autophagosomal but also lysosomal proteins, such as LAMP1 and LAMP2. Since SMCR8 and C9ORF72 protein levels are interdependent (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amick et al., 2016</a>) and lysosomal dysfunction was detected in SMCR8 ko cells as well as in C9ORF72 ko mice (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amick et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sullivan et al., 2016</a>), future studies are required to reveal whether SMCR8 plays a role in ALS-FTD alongside with C9ORF72."

Image segmentation started by detection of the cell nuclei and the cytoplasm in the 633 nm channel (DRAQ5 and HSC CellMask). Cytosolic spots were determined in the 488 nm channel by using specific characteristics such as spot intensity, area and contrast. Resulting output parameters included number of spots and ISS (integrated spot signal) per cell as well as number of cells per well. Raw data of quadruplicates was averaged and subsequently normalized to non-targeting control siRNA (sicon) for every 384 well plate in Excel. To classify candidates in the primary screen, pooled siRNAs had to differ in both spot parameters (number and ISS) for two or three standard deviations from the normalized sicon depending on the autophagosome marker (WIPI2 and ATG12\u00a0=\u00a03; LC3B, GABARAP and STX17\u00a0=\u00a02). Parallel raw data normalization using the z-score and B-score method resulted in similar candidates and additional candidates were included. The top ten increasing and decreasing candidates that were specific for one or common for several autophagosome markers were selected for the deconvolution screen (in total 71). Then, four individual siRNAs per genes were used and validated candidates were determined by differing from sicon in the standard deviation criterion for three out of four siRNAs per gene. Toxic siRNAs were excluded based on obvious changes in number of cells as well as in the intensity and area of the nucleus and of the cytoplasm. Then, two out of three siRNAs were sufficient to determine a validated candidate gene. Genes with more than one cytotoxic siRNA were removed from further analysis."

MADD, RAB27A, DENND2C, and SMCR8 also interact with known autophagy factors. In the second half part, the authors focus on SMCR8, which interacts with FIP200/RB1CC1, the Rab GEF C9ORF72, and its cofactor WDR41. AA 120-320 of SMCR8 interacts with ATG13, whereas a longer region (AA 1-716) is required for the interaction with ULK1 and FIP200. The authors further suggest that SMCR8 regulates not only the autophagosome maturation step (recently published by another group) but also the autophagy initiation step through upregulation of the ULK1 kinase activity and ULK1 gene expression."

In addition, we analyzed cell lysates by size exclusion chromatography and immunoblotting (new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

We could not detect major differences in the distribution of SMCR8, C9ORF72, WDR41 or the ULK1 complex components when comparing Torin1 treated and untreated conditions (new <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B-E</a>). Notably, despite equal input levels the amount of ATG13 immunoprecipitated in Torin1 treated cells is 1.6 fold higher than in controls cells. This increase is also reflected in the co-immunoprecipitated proteins. Size exclusion chromatography might lack the resolution and sensitivity to accurately and quantitatively detect the dynamics of the SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41-ULK1 complex holo-assembly. More sophisticated approaches such as cross-linking MS or cryo-EM would be required to acquire a low-resolution structural view of the holo-assembly. However, we feel that application of these techniques is beyond the scope of this manuscript. The enhanced interaction of SMCR8 and C9ORF72 with FIP200 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E-G</a>) still suggests that the SMCR8-C9ORF72-WDR41-ULK1 complex holo-assembly is preferentially formed upon autophagy induction."

Furthermore, we substituted former <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> showing endogenous IP using SMCR8 knockdown cells with SMCR8 knockout cells and again quantified and normalized three independent experiments (revised <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Since knockdown of SMCR8 caused an increase in ULK1 protein levels, the exact analysis of the amount of co-immunoprecipitated ULK1 complex members was imprecise. In consequence, we performed endogenous immunoprecipitations with SMCR8 knockout cells, in which ULK1 protein levels are constant. Immunoprecipitation of ULK1 and FIP200 at endogenous levels retrieved equal amounts of each other and ATG13 after SMCR8 deletion. Notably, size exclusion chromatography with SMCR8 knockdown cells demonstrated unaltered ULK1 complex composition compared to control cells. These data provide strong evidence that the ULK1 complex composition is unimpaired in absence of SMCR8."
