MG mediates the glycation of proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We have recently demonstrated that MG-induced AGEs are a common feature of breast cancer. Little is known regarding the impact of MG-mediated carbonyl stress on tumor progression. Breast tumors with MG stress presented with high nuclear YAP, a key transcriptional co-activator regulating tumor growth and invasion. Elevated MG levels resulted in sustained YAP nuclear localization/activity that could be reverted using Carnosine, a scavenger for MG. MG treatment affected Hsp90 chaperone activity and decreased its binding to LATS1, a key kinase of the Hippo pathway. Cancer cells with high MG stress showed enhanced growth and metastatic potential in vivo. These findings reinforce the cumulative evidence pointing to hyperglycemia as a risk factor for cancer incidence and bring renewed interest in MG scavengers for cancer treatment."

MG mediates the glycation of proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We have recently demonstrated that MG-induced AGEs are a common feature of breast cancer. Little is known regarding the impact of MG-mediated carbonyl stress on tumor progression. Breast tumors with MG stress presented with high nuclear YAP, a key transcriptional co-activator regulating tumor growth and invasion. Elevated MG levels resulted in sustained YAP nuclear localization/activity that could be reverted using Carnosine, a scavenger for MG. MG treatment affected Hsp90 chaperone activity and decreased its binding to LATS1, a key kinase of the Hippo pathway. Cancer cells with high MG stress showed enhanced growth and metastatic potential in vivo. These findings reinforce the cumulative evidence pointing to hyperglycemia as a risk factor for cancer incidence and bring renewed interest in MG scavengers for cancer treatment."

This process referred to aerobic glycolysis or the 'Warburg effect' is considered as a hallmark of cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ward\u00a0and\u00a0Thompson, 2012</a>). Although aerobic glycolysis is less efficient than respiration to generate ATP, we know now that it effectively supports the anabolic requirements associated with cancer cell growth and proliferation. One underestimated consequence of increased glucose uptake and glycolytic flux is the accumulation of potent toxic metabolites such as reactive carbonyl species. Among those, methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive \u03b1-oxoaldehyde that is primarily formed in cells by the spontaneous degradation of triose phosphate intermediates of glycolysis, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (<a href=\"#bib44\">Richard, 1993</a>). Alpha-oxoaldehydes are up to 20,000-fold more reactive than glucose in glycation processes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Turk, 2010</a>), and it is expected that 1% to 5% of proteins in cells are modified by MG (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rabbani and Thornalley, 2014</a>). MG leads to chemical modification of proteins, lipids and nucleotides that result in cellular dysfunction and mutagenicity. MG interaction with amino groups of proteins notably leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) called hydroimidazolones (MG-H) and argpyrimidines (<a href=\"#bib55\">Thornalley, 1996</a>). All mammalian cells possess a detoxifying system constituted of glyoxalases 1 and 2 (Glo1 and Glo2, respectively), which catalyze the conversion of MG to D-lactate (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thornalley, 2005</a>). The disturbance in the balance between endogenous reactive carbonyl species generation and the ability to counteract their harmful effects is defined as the carbonyl stress."

To the best of our knowledge, only one study has reported MG-derived AGEs detection in malignant tumors (<a href=\"#bib60\">van Heijst\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005</a>). Using immunohistochemistry, we have recently reported the accumulation of argpyrimidine MG adducts in breast cancer tumors (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chiavarina et al., 2014</a>). Remarkably, MG-mediated glycation of specific target proteins happens to be beneficial to cancer progression. For example, the formation of argpyrimidine on heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) prevented cancer cell apoptosis in lung (<a href=\"#bib61\">van Heijst et al., 2006</a>) and gastrointestinal (<a href=\"#bib37\">Oya-Ito et al., 2011</a>) cancers. Moreover, inhibition of MG modification on Hsp27 caused sensitization of cancer cells to antitumoral drugs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sakamoto\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2002</a>)."

Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that gained great interest over the last 20 years as a druggable target for cancer treatment. Hsp90 stabilizes and activates more than 400 proteins, referred to as Hsp90 \u2018clients\u2019, many of which are oncoproteins including transcription factors and kinases that are essential for cellular signal transduction pathways and adaptive responses to stress (<a href=\"#bib58\">Trepel et al., 2010</a>). One such client protein is the large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huntoon et al., 2010</a>), a key kinase that relays anti-proliferative signals in the Hippo pathway through Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) phosphorylation and inactivation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pan, 2010</a>). Consistent with its fundamental role in the control of organ growth and size in vertebrates, the dysfunction of the Hippo signalization triggers tumorigenesis in human (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harvey et al., 2013</a>). As a co-activator of TEAD family of transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>), YAP has been notably shown to enhance cancer progression through transcriptional activation of proliferation promoting genes such as c-myc and CTGF (<a href=\"#bib31\">Moroishi et al., 2015</a>). Recent studies established a link between glucose deprivation stress, aerobic glycolysis and YAP activation in cancer (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeRan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Enzo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mulvihill et al., 2014</a>). Thus, reinforcing the increasing evidence indicating that metabolic pathways play causative roles in conferring an aggressive phenotype upon cancer cells. Because spontaneous MG accumulation results from the glycolytic flux, we hypothesized that MG stress might couple glycolysis to YAP activity. In this study, we show that MG induces YAP nuclear persistence and activity in breast cancer cells and we validate a molecular mechanism implicating MG-mediated Hsp90 inactivation and subsequent LATS1 kinase decrease. Our study establishes for the first time the functional significance of endogenous MG stress and reveals its unexpected connection with cancer cells propensity to grow and metastasize."

We have previously reported MG-mediated carbonyl stress, assessed by argpyrimidine adducts detection, in a series of breast cancer lesions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chiavarina et al., 2014</a>). Recent reports highlighted the importance of glucose metabolism for the regulation of YAP activity in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeRan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Enzo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mulvihill et al., 2014</a>). To explore possible links between YAP activity and carbonyl stress, we performed immunohistochemistry staining of YAP on a series of 87 breast tumors categorized as high and low-to-intermediate carbonyl stress tumors based on their endogenous argpyrimidine level. Remarkably, breast cancer lesions with high carbonyl stress also showed high YAP expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). YAP was scored for nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between nuclear YAP staining in low/intermediate and high carbonyl stress tumors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We demonstrated a positive correlation (R<sub>spearman</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.3975, p=0.0001) between carbonyl stress intensity and nuclear YAP detection.

In order to explore further the potential connection existing between MG-induced carbonyl stress and YAP, we first examined cell-density-dependent YAP subcellular localization in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. YAP was mainly localized in the nucleus of low-density cultured cancer cells as detected by immunofluorescence. When breast cancer cells reached confluence, YAP was not detectable in the nucleus and became generally less visible suggesting that it underwent degradation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A and\u00a0D</a>). Upon MG treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells showed a concentration dependent persistence of YAP in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus despite the cells reached confluence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As a transcriptional co-activator, YAP\u2019s function is strictly constrained by its subcellular localization, thus we will essentially focus on YAP nuclear localization thereafter. Quantification supported that nuclear YAP immunodetection was dose dependently higher in MG treated cells when compared to untreated cells in high-density cultures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Nuclear YAP accumulation was also found to be significant in MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 breast cancer cells upon 300 and 500\u00a0\u03bcM MG treatments (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,D,\u00a0and\u00a0E</a>). We obtained similar results in all three cell lines using a second antibody specifically directed against YAP (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B\u00a0and\u00a0C</a>). We next showed that TAZ, the YAP paralog in mammalian cells, was modulated in the same way in breast cancer cells under MG treatment (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Analysis of total YAP and TAZ expression using Western blot further demonstrated their increase in MG-treated cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u00a0and F</a>). A decreased or a stable cytoplasmic P-YAP (S127 and S381) level was observed and was consistent with nuclear YAP accumulation upon MG treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u00a0and F</a>). YAP mRNA levels were not significantly changed upon MG treatment in the three breast cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>)."

Next, we asked whether the blockade of MG-mediated carbonyl stress using carnosine, a known MG scavenger (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hipkiss and Chana, 1998</a>), could abolish these effects. When MDA-MB-231 cells were concomitantly treated with MG and carnosine, YAP cellular accumulation in high-density cultures was significantly returned to untreated cells basal level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u00a0and E</a>) indicating that YAP persistence in confluent cells directly or indirectly resulted from MG-mediated carbonyl stress. Carnosine alone did not affect significantly cellular YAP immunodetection. After we have validated exogenous MG effects, we used 2 strategies in order to assess high endogenous MG impact on YAP in breast cancer cells: (a) inhibition of <i>GLO1</i>, the main MG-detoxifying enzyme and (b) high-glucose culture condition."

Lactate measurement using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR showed that MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increased their glycolytic activity when cultured in high glucose compared to low glucose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In these cells, high-glucose culture induced elevated endogenous MG level that was assessed using both FACS detection of MBo fluorescent probe (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and LC-MS/MS quantification (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Similar results were observed in the other highly glycolytic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G</a>). As expected, low glycolytic MCF7 cells used for comparison did not react to high-glucose culture condition and kept stable lactate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). More importantly, MCF7 cells showed stable MG levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u00a0and E</a>) thus pointing for the first time to MG increase as a specific response of glycolytic cancer cells to glucose stimulus. After having validated the response of breast cancer cells to high glucose, we next asked whether YAP and TAZ nuclear persistence occurred under glucose-induced elevated endogenous MG levels. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells cultured to confluence in high glucose demonstrated positive nuclear YAP and TAZ staining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u00a0and G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1H\u00a0and I</a>; and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) when compared with cells cultured in low glucose. Next, we reasoned that the inhibition of the glycolytic flux using the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) would reverse this effect. We first validated the decrease of lactate and MG production upon 2-DG treatment using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and FACS detection of MBo fluorescent probe, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u00a0and B</a>).

                                "text": "We next explored the functional relevance of MG-mediated nuclear accumulation of YAP in breast cancer cells. For this purpose, we used two shRNAs specifically directed against <i>GLO1</i> to stably induce high endogenous MG stress in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Efficient <i>GLO1</i> silencing (shRNAs #1 and #2) at the mRNA and protein levels and decreased Glo1 activity were validated in stably depleted clones (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B\u00a0and C</a>, respectively). As expected, <i>GLO1</i>-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells showed YAP and TAZ accumulation in high-cell-density cultures when compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u00a0and E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Consistently, this effect was significantly reversed using carnosine and aminoguanidine MG scavengers (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Stably depleted <i>GLO1</i> MDA-MB-231 cells were used to assess YAP target genes expression based on a previously established gene signature denoting YAP/TAZ activity (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cordenonsi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dupont et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Among the 14 targets tested and known to be regulated positively by YAP, we found that 8 genes, including CTGF gene, showed a significant increase at the mRNA level in <i>GLO1</i> depleted cells when compared to control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Importantly, knock-down of YAP using siRNA transfection reversed, at least in part, the expression of all the evaluated genes thus establishing the link between YAP target genes expression and <i>GLO1</i> status in cancer cells. Efficient YAP silencing in <i>GLO1</i>-depleted MDA-MB-231 is shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>. This result led us to search for a statistical association between YAP and <i>GLO1</i> expression levels using a gene expression dataset of 103 primary mammary tumors (<a href=\"#bib26\">Iwamoto et al., 2011</a>). However, global YAP expression did not show any significant correlation with <i>GLO1</i>. We reasoned that YAP activity, rather than its total expression level, would better reflect YAP nuclear accumulation related to MG stress. Indeed, we found that the expression of YAP target genes and <i>GLO1</i> showed a significant inverse correlation in breast cancer patients. Top 12 genes that displayed the highest Rp Pearson correlation coefficient are reported in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>. These data indicate that high carbonyl stress driven by low <i>GLO1</i> expression in human malignant mammary tumors is significantly associated with an elevated YAP activity."

In order to assess more concretely the impact of MG stress on breast cancer cells through YAP activation, we next focused on CTGF gene expression, a well-described YAP transcriptional target (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>) that has been linked to YAP pro-growth and tumorigenic functions. We performed chromatin IP assays to assess the presence of YAP at CTGF promoter in both sparse and confluent MDA-MB-231 cells. In low-density cultured cells, YAP was bound to CTGF promoter, whereas in confluent cells, YAP was not detectable which is consistent with YAP absence in the nucleus of high-density cells. In contrast, YAP was found at CTGF promoter in MG-treated confluent cells at a comparable level to that in sparse cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Immunoblot of YAP IP loading is shown in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> CTGF mRNA level was not significantly affected by MG treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Smad2/3 collaborate with TEAD and YAP to form an active transcriptional complex at CTGF promoter in breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hiemer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fujii et al., 2012</a>). MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in presence of MG and treated with TGF-\u03b2 (2.5 ng/ml) responded by a two-fold increase of CTGF mRNA level compared to TGF-\u03b2 alone confirming the requirement of TGF-\u03b2 pathway activation for MG-mediated induction of CTGF expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation following TGF-\u03b2 treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells was not affected by MG treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) indicating that CTGF up-regulation was linked to YAP accumulation in presence of active TGF-\u03b2 pathway effectors. In agreement with this deduction, we showed that YAP silencing prevented MG-mediated CTGF mRNA induction in presence of TGF-\u03b2 in confluent MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Efficient YAP silencing was shown at the mRNA (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) and protein (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>) levels."

However, MG-adducts immunoprecipitation in MDA-MB-231 treated with MG did not allow western blot detection of YAP (data not shown). LATS1/2 are the main upstream Hippo pathway kinases that phosphorylate YAP, thus preventing its nuclear translocation and oncogenic activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We hypothesized that MG-mediated sustained YAP nuclear localization could be related to a relaxed LATS1/2 control notably due to its decreased expression. We demonstrated by Western blotting that LATS1, and not LATS2, was significantly decreased upon MG treatment (300 and 500 \u03bcM) in both glycolytic MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 and non-glycolytic MCF7 breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). LATS1 mRNA levels were not affected by MG in the three breast cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). A previous study has shown that LATS1 kinase degradation occurs through polyubiquitination and the proteasome pathway in breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">He et al., 2016</a>). In good accordance, the treatment of breast cancer cells with MG132 proteasome inhibitor induced LATS1 increase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Next, we verified whether MG favored LATS1 decrease through proteasome degradation. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, the use of MG132 proteasome inhibitor reverted MG-induced LATS1 decrease. Next, we explored whether LATS1 decrease could explain, at least in part, the sustained YAP nuclear localization induced by MG. Accordingly, when we overexpressed LATS1, we were able to revert MG effects on YAP accumulation as assessed by immunofluorescence using two anti-YAP antibodies in MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and in the other breast cancer cell lines analyzed (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C\u00a0and D</a>). LATS1 overexpression is shown using anti-Flag and anti-LATS1 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Data gathered so far indicate that MG decreases LATS1 expression in breast cancer cells, through the proteasome, which leads to sustained activity of YAP in the nucleus."

                                "text": "To explore further MG mechanism of action on LATS1, we first excluded the possibility of (a) an interference of MG with the expression of Mst1/2 kinases directly upstream of LATS1 along the Hippo pathway (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and (b) a direct glycation of LATS1 by MG using immunoprecipitation technique (data not shown). Then, we got interested in LATS1 as a client of Hsp90 chaperone protein (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huntoon et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, LATS1 kinase expression level and activity are dependent on its stabilization by Hsp90. 17-AAG, a potent Hsp90 inhibitor, disrupts LATS1 tumor suppressor activity in human cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huntoon et al., 2010</a>). <i>HSP90</i> mRNA level was not modulated by MG treatment in breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Therefore, we sought to explore whether MG could modify Hsp90, thus indirectly impacting on LATS1 stability and degradation. The incubation of human recombinant Hsp90 with MG followed by MS analysis revealed the modification of several lysine and arginine residues notably yielding to the formation of carboxyethyllysine (CEL) and argpyrimidine/hydroimidazolone adducts, respectively (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). Next, we examined whether endogenous MG-modified Hsp90 could be detected in MG-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Immunoprecipitation of MG-treated MDA-MB-231 extracts using anti-argpyrimidine MG adducts and followed by Hsp90 immunoblot analysis allowed us to detect a basal level of glycated Hsp90 in MDA-MB-231 glycolytic cells that was further enhanced upon MG treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Hsp27, which is recognized as a major MG target in cancer cells, was also efficiently detected in argpyrimidine immunoprecipitates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Consistently, the reverse IP experiment using an anti-Hsp90 antibody allowed the detection of both argpyrimidine and hydroimidazolone MG-adducts of the expected molecular weight in MG treated cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Argpyrimidine immunoprecipitates subjected to MS analysis revealed the presence of modified Hsp90 on several residues (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 2</a>). Glycation hot spots observed on exogenous and/or endogenous Hsp90 are summarized in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and detailed amino acid sequence is provided in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> The mapping of MG modifications on Hsp90 amino-acid sequence indicated that functionally important domains involved in both substrate/co-chaperone and ATP binding showed several glycated residues (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) suggesting that Hsp90 activity could be affected. Recombinant human Hsp90 (rhHsp90) was effectively modified by MG and was protected by carnosine MG-scavenger as assessed using both anti-argpyrimidine and anti-hydroimidazolone antibodies in Western blot experiments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Using an in vitro enzymatic assay, MG decreased rhHsp90 activity to an extent that was comparable to that seen using 17-AAG (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Incubation of rhHsp90 with MG in presence of carnosine efficiently reversed this effect indicating for the first time that direct MG glycation of Hsp90 affects its ATPase activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Furthermore, both MG and 17-AAG decreased LATS1 expression in the three breast cancer cell lines under study (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Next, we further documented LATS1 binding to Hsp90 in the context of MG treatment. LATS1 immunoprecipitates contained detectable Hsp90 however this interaction was disrupted in presence of MG in MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Collectively, our findings show that MG relieves LATS1 control on YAP nuclear localization through a mechanism identifying for the first time MG-mediated post-translational glycation and inactivation of Hsp90 in cancer cells."

Next, we explored the biological relevance of this observation for tumor growth and metastases development. Stably <i>GLO1</i>-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells that were grafted subcutaneously in mice showed an increased tumor weight and volume that reached significance for sh<i>GLO1</i>#2-silenced clones (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Further exploration of sh<i>GLO1</i> experimental tumors using immunoblotting revealed the effective in vivo induction of argpyrimidine adducts and a strong inverse relationship between <i>GLO1</i> silencing and total YAP expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u00a0and C</a>). In <i>GLO1</i>-silenced experimental tumors, we further demonstrated a specific increase of YAP in the nucleus of tumor cells using immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u00a0and E</a>). Elevated proportion of Ki67 positive cells in sh<i>GLO1</i> tumors sustained the observed increased tumor growth, as shown and scored in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u00a0and E</a>, respectively. In order to explore further the association between high MG, YAP activity and tumor growth, we used the in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM). Grafted <i>GLO1</i>-depleted cells on the CAM showed increased growth as assessed by the measure of tumor volume and compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u00a0and G</a>). Remarkably, YAP knockdown with two independent siRNAs further demonstrated the causative role of YAP in MG-induced tumor growth. Indeed, YAP silencing in sh<i>GLO1</i> cells efficiently reverted tumor growth to control levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u00a0and G</a>). As shown on mice experimental tumors, we observed significant YAP nuclear localization in CAM sh<i>GLO1</i> tumors (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H\u00a0and I</a>). YAP silencing was maintained for the entire duration of the CAM assay experiment (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

After surgical removal of the primary tumors, the mice were followed for metastases development during an additional period of 6 weeks. The follow-up of the mice showed that lung metastases were detectable already after 3 weeks in <i>GLO1</i>-depleted conditions but not in control condition. After 6 weeks post-tumor removal, metastasized tumors were observed in the lungs of <i>GLO1</i>-depleted mice (68%) when compared to control (20%). To evaluate further lung colonization, we performed human vimentin immunohistochemical detection that revealed a significant increase of both number and size of metastatic foci in <i>GLO1-</i>depleted condition (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), as quantified in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>. Using serial sections, we assessed efficient <i>GLO1</i> depletion on the same metastatic foci (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). These data demonstrate that breast cancer cells undergoing a carbonyl stress show enhanced growth and metastatic capacity thus highlighting an unexpected pro-tumoral role for MG endogenous accumulation. Finally, to better assess the importance of MG stress on metastatic dissemination, sh<i>GLO1</i> mice received carnosine (10 mM) in drinking water from the day of primary tumor removal until the end of the experiment (during 6 weeks). We observed a significant decrease of lung colonization in sh<i>GLO1</i> mice treated with carnosine when compared with control mice (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C\u00a0and D</a>). Collectively, our data indicate that the pro-cancer effects of carbonyl stress unveiled here are tightly associated with YAP enhanced activity and can be efficiently blocked using a MG scavenger."

Here, we demonstrate that MG-mediated carbonyl stress interferes with LATS1 kinase, without affecting LATS2 and Mst1/2 kinases, to induce sustained YAP and TAZ nuclear localization. The hypermethylation of the promoter region of LATS1 gene (50% of breast tumors) is associated with an aggressive breast cancer phenotype and poor survival (<a href=\"#bib53\">Takahashi\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005</a>). We show in this study that LATS1 proteasomal degradation is favored in presence of MG thus bringing to light a new concept according to which MG stress could directly and/or indirectly participate to the control of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells without affecting their transcriptional rate."

Our study meets a new trend of thoughts proposing that energy metabolism is an additional upstream signal that regulates YAP oncogenic activity. Three independent studies recently established a link between the Hippo-YAP pathway and cellular energy stress using a glucose deprivation strategy (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeRan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). These studies are in agreement that under low-glucose condition an AMPK-LATS1 axis inhibits YAP activity. Enzo and collaborators (<a href=\"#bib14\">Enzo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015</a>) have recently demonstrated that aerobic glycolysis impacts on YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity through a mechanism involving phosphofructokinase 1 binding to TEAD transcription factors. A recent metabolic profiling study using breast cancer progression cellular models reported the induction of several glycolytic enzymes upon constitutive activation of YAP/TAZ factors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mulvihill et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that MG could regulate key glycolytic enzymes expression in a YAP-dependent manner thus creating a mutual regulatory loop where glycolysis-induced MG stress favors YAP activity, which in turn activates glycolysis. Considering that glucose metabolism inevitably leads to MG formation, one might speculate that any signaling pathway favoring the Warburg effect, e.g the Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pate et al., 2014</a>), will ultimately feed MG carbonyl stress in cancer cells."

Although several post-translational modifications have been previously reported to affect Hsp90 stability and chaperone function, our study importantly uncovers that a natural metabolite derived from glycolysis is involved in regulating Hsp90 in cancer cells. Quantitative glycation studies will help to determine the proportion of Hsp90 molecules that are glycated by MG, the degree of glycation of specific residues per molecule and to what extent Hsp90 activity is likely to be inhibited in cancer cells. Decreasing Hsp90 client binding has been considered as an attractive anti-cancer therapy because of its role in stabilizing the active form of a wide range of client oncoproteins and several synthetic Hsp90 inhibitors are now in clinical trials (<a href=\"#bib34\">Neckers and Workman, 2012</a>). Nevertheless, cumulative evidence tends to prove that Hsp90-directed therapy also induces pro-cancer effects. For example, Hsp90 inhibition promotes prostate cancer growth through Src kinase activation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yano et al., 2008</a>) and favors breast cancer bone metastases formation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Price\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005</a>). It is generally estimated that over sixty percent of all cancers are glycolytic. This study showing that a glycolysis metabolite interferes with Hsp90 activity even more crucially raises significant concerns about the use of Hsp90 inhibitors as cancer treatment. The above-mentioned tumor-promoting effects related to Hsp90 inhibition could be potentially recapitulated under MG-mediated carbonyl stress condition in cancer cells. Consistent with this hypothesis and our data, LATS1 signalization in the Hippo pathway is rendered ineffective in ovarian cancer xenograft tumors from mice treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huntoon et al., 2010</a>)."

Most of the recent studies aimed at the inhibition of <i>GLO1</i> to induce a toxic MG accumulation effectively showed a decreased tumor growth.

Using stably depleted <i>GLO1</i> xenografts in vivo, we have also demonstrated the pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic role of endogenous MG accumulation in breast cancer cells.

In our hands, <i>GLO1</i> knockdown or inhibition using BBGC did not induce any significant cell apoptosis and hence conferred pro-growth and pro-metastatic advantages to breast cancer cells.

Future studies will have to assess the potential use of circulating MG and/or specific MG adducts as cancer biomarkers. Recent studies indicated that cancer in diabetic patients presents with a higher incidence and a poorer prognosis than in non-diabetic persons (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ryu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Xu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>). Our study hereby provides with a potential molecular mechanism for cancer-diabetes connection. A better understanding of MG pro-cancer effects could lead to the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies based on the scavenging of MG. Interestingly, both MG scavengers metformin and carnosine have been shown to exert anti-tumoral effects (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Giovannucci et al., 2010</a>) and metformin proved efficient to reduce systemic MG levels in diabetic patients (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beisswenger et al., 1999</a>). DeRan and collaborators (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeRan et al., 2014</a>) reported that metformin, and its more potent analog phenformin, inhibited YAP activity through AMPK signaling. Metformin is better known as a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor and a potent AMPK inducer, and it is somehow overlooked for its MG scavenging capacities. Accordingly, it is not excluded that metformin could have also exerted, at least in part, its inhibitory activity on YAP function through its MG scavenging properties. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that high MG stress-tumor xenografts showed a significantly lower propensity to metastasize in animals supplemented with carnosine in their drinking water. The crucial role of glucose metabolism in aggressive tumors has logically directed cancer therapy research towards the use of anti-diabetic drugs as effective anti-cancer agents and metformin is actually tested in several anti-cancer clinical trials (<a href=\"#bib41\">Quinn et al., 2013</a>)."

All cell lines were authenticated by STR profiling at the Leibniz-Institute DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and were regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Cells were either cultured in high-glucose DMEM (standard glucose concentration of 4.5 g/L, Lonza) or in DMEM medium with a glucose concentration of 1 g/l (low-glucose medium) both containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Lonza). One g/l glucose level is physiological and reflects the in vivo concentrations in human serum. Conversely, the routine culture media concentration of 4.5 g/l (high-glucose medium) corresponds to a diabetic condition. In our experimental model, sparse cells are defined as low-glucose cultured cells seeded at low density (for example, for a 6-well plate: MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 were seeded at 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> cells/well).

Modified rhHsp90 as described above was first digested using Lys-C protease (in Tris-HCl 25 mM, pH8.5, 1 mM EDTA overnight at 37\u00b0C; first step at 1/40 sample/protease and then addition of 1/50 sample/protease in 50% acetonitrile for 4 hr). Resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography (UPLC Waters M Class) in one dimension on a HSS T3 C18 analytical column (25 cm length, 75 \u00b5M ID) with an increasing ratio of acetonitrile/water (2\u201340% in 32 min) at a 600 nL/min flow rate. The system was coupled to the mass spectrometer described above. A shortlist of 54 peptides were manually selected and used in further targeted experiments. Two \u2018Parallel Reaction Monitoring\u2019 or PRM (i.e. targeted full MS/MS) methods were set up in order to obtain at least 12 data points in chromatographic peaks and they were run consecutively for each sample. Data were then analyzed using Skyline 3.1 and were manually validated. For these experiments, protein extract from MDA-MB-231 treated or not with MG 300 \u00b5M during 6 hr were immunoprecipitated with argpyrimidine antibody. These samples were prepared in a slightly different way than rhHsp90: whole samples were reduced, alkylated and then purified using the 2D Clean-up kit (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The samples were then resuspended in the proteolysis buffer and the digestion was performed assuming an amount of 5 \u00b5g to be digested. The following steps were the same as for the recombinant protein."

A parallel experiment was conducted on sh<i>GLO1</i>#1 mice (n\u00a0=\u00a010) where they received carnosine (10 mM) in drinking water refreshed every 3 days from the day of primary tumor removal until the end of the experiment (for 6 weeks).

It demonstrates that methylglyoxal (MG) post-translationally modifies Hsp90, resulting in enhanced degradation of the tumor suppressor kinase LATS1. This enables persistent nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of YAP, leading to enhanced cell proliferation and migration. Increasing access to glucose was sufficient to increase MG modifications and YAP nuclear localization in breast cancer cells, and increasing MG levels by silencing glyoxylase-1 (Glo-1) had similar effects. In xenografts, chronic Glo1 silencing enhanced tumor growth and Ki67 content."

                    "text": "We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. As proposed, we have undertaken the LC/MS/MS measure of intracellular MG levels on MDA-MB-231 cell pellets cultured under high/low glucose, Glo1 silencing as well as upon exogenous MG addition. For this purpose, we have asked for the contribution of external collaborators (J.S and C.S, now added as co-authors) who had the expertise for MG dosage on cell pellets using UPLC/MS/MS. To homogenize the techniques used, extracellular MG levels were measured in parallel on matched supernatant samples. Therefore, new extracellular MG concentrations expressed as nanomoles/L normalized to the number of cells are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>. Intracellular MG concentrations measured on cell pellet lysates are shown below in <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 1</a>. Several conclusions can be drawn from these measurements: (1) Intracellular MG concentrations are more elevated than extracellular ones. This observation is in good accordance with previous studies (Rabbani and Thornalley, Nature Protocols, 2014) and has been notably attributed to the fact that intracellular concentrations account for both free MG and reversibly bound MG to cellular targets (proteins, nucleic acids and lipids) (Chaplen et al., Analytical Biochemistry, 1996). (2) As shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 1A</a>, intracellular MG concentrations levels were found to be very similar in all conditions indicating that MG quantification in cells is not relevant to assess the extent of carbonyl stress. In fact, such measurement of MG has never been reported before in cancer cells and several questions await further detailed analytical studies. Is free MG gradient the factor that equilibrates its concentration between extracellular and intracellular compartments? The data shown tend to indicate that it is not the case as 6-fold more MG is found in the extracellular medium than in cells upon exogenous MG treatment (300\u03bcm 48h). According to its high reactivity, is it conceivable that free MG could be measured inside the cells? No doubt that Glo1 activity level will also control final free MG concentrations. (3)It is particularly striking that under exogenous MG stimulation, MG concentration inside the cells remains stable while it is significantly increased in the extracellular medium (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 1A and B</a>). An effect that could be attributed to the presence of cellular Glo1 activity that maintains MG levels under a certain sub-cytotoxic threshold. In good accordance with this hypothesis, we have previously demonstrated that MDA-MB-231 cells increase their Glo1 activity in response to exogenous MG addition (Chiavarina et al., Oncotarget, 2014). Based on these new experiments, we conclude that extracellular concentrations of MG are the most relevant to assess carbonyl stress in all 3 experimental conditions. When it comes to intracellular MG evaluation, we strongly believe that the quantification of MG-adducts using western blotting is a better reflection of carbonyl stress under all 3 experimental conditions (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 1C and D</a>). MG level in MDA-MB-231 cells was approximately 6\u03bcM which is slightly higher than the previous range of concentrations reported for normal mammalian cells (1 to 4 \u03bcM) which may be attributable to the glycolytic phenotype of these cancer cells. The role of MG-mediated carbonyl stress has been understudied in cancer but it is gaining much of interest nowadays (Sullivan LB, et al., Nature reviews Cancer, Sept. 2016). To the best of our knowledge MG concentrations have not yet been established in cancer patients in comparison with healthy subjects. Moreover, the local concentrations of MG achieved in highly glycolytic tumors are not known and must be a balance between the amount produced (glycolytic flux), amount carried away by vasculature and how it is catabolized by tumor and/or stromal cells. Our in vitro studies indicate that MDA-MB-231 cells can tolerate high amounts of MG (IC50 = 938\u03bcM). Until more studies are undertaken in this direction it is difficult to assess what should be considered as supraphysiological levels of MG and pending a better understanding of how and what proportion of exogenous MG enters the cells, the detection of MG adducts accumulation and/or extracellular MG concentrations in tumor cells represents the best indication of MG-mediated carbonyl stress upon both exogenous and endogenous MG supply in our in vivo and in vitro experiments."
