To test the effects of aneuploidy on chromosome segregation and other mitotic phenotypes we used the colorectal cancer cell line DLD1 (2n = 46) and two variants with trisomy 7 or 13 (DLD1+7 and DLD1+13), as well as euploid and trisomy 13 amniocytes (AF and AF+13). We found that trisomic cells displayed higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation compared to their euploid counterparts. Furthermore, cells with trisomy 13 displayed a distinctive cytokinesis failure phenotype. We showed that up-regulation of SPG20 expression, brought about by trisomy 13 in DLD1+13 and AF+13 cells, is sufficient for the cytokinesis failure phenotype. Overall, our study shows that aneuploidy can induce chromosome mis-segregation. Moreover, we identified a trisomy 13-specific mitotic phenotype that is driven by up-regulation of a gene encoded on the aneuploid chromosome."

To test the effects of aneuploidy on chromosome segregation and other mitotic phenotypes we used the colorectal cancer cell line DLD1 (2n = 46) and two variants with trisomy 7 or 13 (DLD1+7 and DLD1+13), as well as euploid and trisomy 13 amniocytes (AF and AF+13). We found that trisomic cells displayed higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation compared to their euploid counterparts. Furthermore, cells with trisomy 13 displayed a distinctive cytokinesis failure phenotype. We showed that up-regulation of SPG20 expression, brought about by trisomy 13 in DLD1+13 and AF+13 cells, is sufficient for the cytokinesis failure phenotype. Overall, our study shows that aneuploidy can induce chromosome mis-segregation. Moreover, we identified a trisomy 13-specific mitotic phenotype that is driven by up-regulation of a gene encoded on the aneuploid chromosome."

                        "text": "Aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a leading cause of mis-carriage and birth defects in humans (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nagaoka et al., 2012</a>). In the vast majority of cases, this is due to errors occurring in the oocyte (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nagaoka et al., 2012</a>). However, aneuploidy can also arise in somatic cells, and a number of studies have reported age-dependent increases in aneuploidy in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nowinski et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Carere et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Leopardi et al., 2002</a>). Moreover, aneuploidy was recognized as a common feature of cancer cells already a century ago (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boveri, 1914</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2008</a>), and a causal role of aneuploidy in carcinogenesis is currently largely acknowledged (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib46\">Pavelka et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nicholson and Cimini, 2011</a>]). In addition to being aneuploid, cancer cells typically display high rates of chromosome mis-segregation, a phenomenon termed <i>c</i>hromosomal <i>in</i>stability (CIN) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lengauer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bakhoum et al., 2014</a>). The observation that even mosaic aneuploidy can cause severe physical and cognitive developmental defects (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biesecker and Spinner, 2013</a>) indicates that aneuploidy has pleiotropic deleterious effects. This idea is further supported by a number of experimental observations: first, knocking down spindle assembly checkpoint genes, which results in high rates chromosome mis-segregation and high levels of aneuploidy, invariably causes embryonic lethality in mouse models (<a href=\"#bib20\">Foijer et al., 2008</a>). Second, aneuploid yeast strains were shown to exhibit defects in cell cycle progression and metabolism (<a href=\"#bib67\">Torres et al., 2007</a>). Third, MEFs derived from mice carrying specific trisomies were found to display cell proliferation defects and metabolic alterations (<a href=\"#bib74\">Williams et al., 2008</a>). Finally, genes involved in stress response were shown to be upregulated in aneuploid yeast and human cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sheltzer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stingele et al., 2012</a>). But in the context of cancer, aneuploidy and CIN strongly correlate with drug resistance (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2011</a>) and poor patient prognosis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bardi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carter et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Walther et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sheffer et al., 2009</a>), indicating that aneuploidy and CIN may confer a proliferative advantage to cancer cells. In support of this idea, certain aneuploidies were found to confer drug resistance in aneuploid <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pavelka et al., 2010b</a>) and <i>Candida albicans</i> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Selmecki et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2009</a>). These studies suggest that aneuploidy may confer adaptability by inducing chromosome-specific phenotypic changes, despite general negative effects on cell physiology. However, this problem remains to be investigated in human cells."

In fact, this question has been difficult to address in cancer cells due to the complexity of cancer karyotypes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gisselsson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mitelman et al., 2014</a>), and previous studies in human cancer and non-cancer cells have reached discrepant conclusions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lengauer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Duesberg et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Miyazaki et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Valind et al., 2013</a>). To determine the effect of aneuploidy on chromosome segregation and cell division in human cells, we utilized a number of diploid human cell types and trisomic counterparts, including: colorectal cancer cell line DLD1 (2n = 46) and trisomic counterparts carrying extra copies of chromosomes 7 or 13 (DLD1+7 and DLD1+13, respectively); diploid amniotic fibroblasts (AF) and amniotic fibroblasts with trisomy 13 (AF+13). These different cell types constitute a good model for our study for two main reasons: first, their karyotypes are aneuploid, but not as complex as typically found in tumors and cancer cell lines; second, they represent different cellular models (transformed and untransformed) of aneuploidy."

The presence of the additional chromosome was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with locus-specific probes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). Analysis of DLD1+7 cells previously showed that a large fraction (87%) of the population was trisomic (<a href=\"#bib69\">Upender et al., 2004</a>). However, the DLD1+13 cell population was shown to rapidly accumulate disomic (by loss of one copy of chromosome 13) and tetraploid cell populations (<a href=\"#bib69\">Upender et al., 2004</a>). Thus, for this study we sub-cloned DLD1+13 cells in order to select a more homogenous cell population. When we analyzed the clone selected for this study at early passages (P. 3\u20134) by chromosome 13 painting, we found that 83.5% of the cells in the population carried the trisomy 13 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Similarly, analysis of AF+13 interphase nuclei (passage 1\u20132) FISH-stained with probes specific for chromosomes 13 and 21 showed that the cell populations used in this study were highly homogenous (88.1 \u00b1 6.5%) for the trisomic karyotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Furthermore, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of all three DLD1 cell lines (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,E</a>). In all DLD1 cell lines, we found amplification of regions on the p arm of chromosomes 2 and 11 and a deletion of a region on the p arm of chromosome 6, which are known to be recurrently found in DLD1 cells. In addition to these common copy number variations (CNVs), the DLD1+7 cell line (analyzed at passage 4) carried a partial trisomy 7 including most of the q arm (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>). FISH staining with a probe specific to the centromere of chromosome 7 confirmed that the extra chromosome included a centromere (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). aCGH of DLD1+13 cells (at passage 11) showed that in addition to the CNVs identified in all three DLD1 cell lines, there was an extra copy of the entire chromosome 13 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013F</a>). The experiments described hereafter were performed at passage number 7\u201325 for DLD1+7 cells and 13\u201325 for DLD1+13 cells to limit evolution of the karyotypes and passage number 1\u20133 for amniocytes, whose proliferation was limited to few passages."

                                "text": "As an additional method to measure chromosome mis-segregation and to account for events in which two sister chromatids co-segregate to the same spindle pole/daughter cell, we combined the cytokinesis-block assay (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fenech, 1993</a>) with FISH staining using locus-specific probes for chromosomes 3, 7, 11, and 13 in DLD1 cell lines, and probes specific for chromosomes 7, 11, 12, 13, 18, and 19 in amniocytes. Using this approach, which allows analysis of the reciprocal distribution of chromosomes between the daughter nuclei of a single mitotic division (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we found a significant increase in chromosome mis-segregation in DLD1+7, DLD1+13, and AF+13 compared to the corresponding diploid cell cultures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>). However, the higher mis-segregation rates were specific to certain chromosomes. Namely, mis-segregation appeared to be increased for chromosome 7 in the DLD1+7 cell line, chromosomes 7 and 13 in DLD1+13 cells, and chromosome 13 in AF+13 cells as compared to their diploid counterparts. We further investigated whether the observed increases in chromosome mis-segregation rates impacted chromosome number variability (or karyotypic heterogeneity) in the trisomic cells compared to the diploid counterparts. To this end, we performed chromosome counts in metaphase spreads and found increased karyotypic heterogeneity in both DLD1+7 and DLD1+13 compared to DLD1 cells. We also found higher karyotypic heterogeneity in AF+13 vs AF cells around the modal chromosome number of 47 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Finally, our chromosome counts revealed the presence of a tetraploid/near-tetraploid sub-population in DLD1+13 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), confirming previous findings (<a href=\"#bib69\">Upender et al., 2004</a>). Because chromosome counts did not reveal a significant difference in tetraploid cells between AF and AF+13 cell populations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), we decided to further characterize chromosome number variability in these cells by performing FISH analysis with locus-specific probes for chromosomes 7, 12, and 18 on interphase nuclei (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), which allowed for larger numbers of cells to be examined. This analysis confirmed higher degrees of aneuploidy in AF+13 compared to AF cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Furthermore, it revealed the presence of a tetraploid sub-population in AF+13 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The difference between numbers of AF+13 tetraploid interphase cells and tetraploid chromosome spreads (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) may be due to the inability of tetraploid AF+13 cells to re-enter mitosis (see also \u2018Discussion\u2019 section). Taken together, these experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2\u20133</a>) show that trisomies 7 and 13 cause chromosome mis-segregation, that mis-segregation affects certain chromosomes more than others, and that such increases in mis-segregation rates are associated with karyotypic heterogeneity within the cell population. However, because only trisomies 7 and 13 were examined, and a limited number of chromosomes analyzed in our FISH experiments, it remains elusive whether chromosome mis-segregation is a karyotype-specific or a general effect of aneuploidy in human cells."

                                "text": "Our chromosome counts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) showed that DLD1+13 cells displayed a near-tetraploid sub-population, which was also evident in our FISH experiments in which nuclei with four or more signals per chromosome were more frequent in DLD1+13 compared to DLD1 cells (24.5% vs 16.6%, \u03c7<sup>2</sup>, p &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, a tetraploid sub-population was evident in AF+13 cells (4.5% vs 0.3% in AF, \u03c7<sup>2</sup>, p &lt; 0.0001) analyzed by interphase FISH, which revealed the presence of nuclei with four signals per chromosome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>). These observations suggested a possible causal link between trisomy 13 and tetraploidy. Acknowledged mechanisms of tetraploidy induction include mitotic slippage (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rieder and Maiato, 2004</a>), cytokinesis failure (<a href=\"#bib43\">Normand and King, 2010</a>), and cell fusion (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duelli and Lazebnik, 2003</a>). To determine which of these mechanisms cause tetraploidy in DLD1+13 and AF+13 cells, we performed phase contrast time-lapse microscopy and found no evidence of mitotic slippage or cell fusion. Instead, we found that both DLD1+13 and AF+13 cells failed cytokinesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3\u20136</a>) at significantly higher rates than their diploid counterparts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). To identify the molecular mechanism that causes cytokinesis failure in cells with trisomy 13, we referred to microarray data available for DLD1+13 cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Upender et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, located on chromosome 13q13.3 is the gene <i>SPG20</i>, which encodes for the protein Spartin, previously suggested to act as a regulator of cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Renvoise et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lind et al., 2011</a>), and shown to be overexpressed in DLD1+13 compared to DLD1 cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Upender et al., 2004</a>). None of the other mis-expressed genes (<a href=\"#bib69\">Upender et al., 2004</a>) was found to have any link with cytokinesis based on published data. We confirmed SPG20 overexpression by western blot in both DLD1+13 and AF+13 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>). Importantly, neither DLD1+7 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) nor other trisomic AF cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) overexpressed spartin, indicating that high levels of spartin are specifically associated with trisomy 13."

Spartin localized to the centrosomes throughout mitosis and to some extent along the microtubules of the mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and localized to the midbody during cytokinesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), as previously described (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lind et al., 2011</a>). We quantified the total intracellular amount of Spartin by measuring total Spartin fluorescence intensity in interphase cells, and found that it was significantly higher in DLD1+13 cells compared to DLD1 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, we did not observe any difference in Spartin localization between the two cell lines during mitosis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), although there was clearly a large amount of Spartin in the cytoplasm, away from the mitotic spindle, in DLD1+13, but not in the other cell lines (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, although Spartin overexpression induces cytokinesis failure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>), the mechanism by which this happens is not simply mis-localization of Spartin at the midbody (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

Both Spartin and Spastin bind hIST1 through their MIT (Microtubule Interacting and Trafficking) domains, which show considerable structural homology (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and comparable binding affinities (Spartin, K<sub>d</sub> = 10.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, Spastin, K<sub>d</sub> = 4.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM, respectively [<a href=\"#bib51\">Renvoise et al., 2010</a>]). Therefore, we postulated that Spartin overexpression might act in a dominant negative manner by preventing Spastin from binding to hIST1. To test this, we analyzed Spastin localization at the midbody. Consistent with our hypothesis, DLD1+13 and AF+13 cells frequently lacked Spastin at the midbody (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013G</a>). Moreover, by knocking down Spartin we could rescue Spastin mis-localization fully in DLD1+13 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) and partially in AF+13 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>)."

                                "text": "We show here that cells with trisomy 7 or trisomy 13 display rates of anaphase lagging chromosomes that are significantly higher than the rates observed in euploid counterparts. Anaphase lagging chromosomes are a major source of aneuploidy in normal vertebrate cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cimini et al., 2001</a>) and the main type of chromosome segregation defect observed in CIN cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib66\">Thompson and Compton, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bakhoum et al., 2014</a>). Previous studies have shown that anaphase lagging chromosomes can be caused by transient spindle multipolarity in CIN cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ganem et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Silkworth et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Silkworth and Cimini, 2012</a>). However, we can exclude transient multipolarity as a cause of anaphase lagging chromosomes in our experimental systems, given that we did not find differences in the frequencies of multipolar mitoses in DLD1+7 and DLD1+13 compared to DLD1 cells and we did not observe transient spindle multipolarity in live AF+13. This finding may seem surprising, particularly considering that we found trisomy 13 to be associated with cytokinesis failure, which is believed to result in extra centrosomes and multipolar mitoses (<a href=\"#bib63\">Storchova and Pellman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fujiwara et al., 2005</a>). However, this finding is in agreement with recent findings showing that experimental inhibition of cytokinesis can produce tetraploid cells with normal centrosome number (<a href=\"#bib26\">Godinho et al., 2014</a>). Our finding that aneuploidy is associated with increased rates of anaphase lagging chromosomes, known to arise from errors in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bakhoum et al., 2014</a>), but not with multipolarity or chromosome bridges, known to arise from errors in centrosome duplication or DNA metabolism (occurring prior to mitosis), suggests that compared to events occurring during other cell cycle stages, mitotic events may be more sensitive to the gene imbalance brought about by aneuploidy. Although abnormal chromosome number was reported by others as not being sufficient to cause CIN (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lengauer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Valind et al., 2013</a>), such difference may be due to the different methods used to evaluate CIN. For example, whereas we examined chromosome mis-segregation in mitosis (anaphase lagging chromosomes) or at a post-mitotic interphase (BN cell analysis), Lengauer and colleagues determined the degree of aneuploidy in the overall population after 25 serial passages (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lengauer et al., 1997</a>). This kind of analysis may produce a biased result because selective pressure against arising aneuploid cells may mask the ability of aneuploidy to induce chromosome mis-segregation at each cell cycle. Importantly, we were able to perform high-resolution live cell imaging of individual human amniocytes with constitutional trisomy 13 at passage number 2\u20133 and directly measure how frequently chromosome mis-segregation events occur. The frequency of lagging chromosomes found in mitotic cells was considerably higher compared to the frequency of chromosome mis-segregation measured by FISH analysis both in interphase and post-mitotic fixed cells. This shows how different results are generated from distinct methods and might also explain the divergence between our data and those previously reported by <a href=\"#bib72\">Valind et al. (2013)</a> using interphase FISH analysis. It should also be noted that, although we do observe an increase in the rates of anaphase lagging chromosomes in trisomic cells, such rates are lower than those reported for most CIN cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#bib66\">Thompson and Compton, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nicholson and Cimini, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bakhoum et al., 2014</a>), in agreement with findings by <a href=\"#bib72\">Valind et al. (2013)</a>. This suggests that, although single chromosome gains may result in only modest increases in chromosome mis-segregation rates, the high degrees of aneuploidy typical of most cancer cells may have a cumulative effect and could thus explain the high rates of CIN displayed by many cancer cells (e.g., 20\u201375% anaphase lagging chromosomes in cells with modal chromosome number 66\u201378; [<a href=\"#bib33\">Lengauer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Thompson and Compton, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ganem et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Silkworth et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nicholson and Cimini, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2013</a>]). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the discrepancies in the conclusions reached in different studies may depend on the specific chromosomes analyzed. Indeed, we find that the degree and type of CIN elicited by aneuploidy depend on the aneuploid chromosome (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This is an agreement with findings in aneuploid budding yeast strains, in which different aneuploidies were found to result in different rates of chromosome loss/CIN (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sheltzer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, Valind and colleagues reported increased rates of CIN for certain chromosomes in specific aneuploid contexts (e.g., increased CIN for chromosome 17 in cells with trisomy 18), but not in others (<a href=\"#bib72\">Valind et al., 2013</a>). In our study, we specifically found that high rates of mis-segregation for chromosome 7 were observed both in DLD1+7 and DLD1+13 cells, whereas high mis-segregation for chromosome 13 was observed in DLD1+13 and AF+13 cells. The observation that the trisomic chromosome displayed the highest rates of mis-segregation across the trisomies studied (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>) suggests that the aneuploid chromosomes may undergo changes that affect their mitotic behavior and segregation, such as delayed replication and/or delayed condensation timing (DRT and DCT, respectively). Indeed, aneuploidy was shown to correlate with DRT and DCT (<a href=\"#bib28\">Grinberg-Rashi et al., 2010</a>) and previous studies in trisomic cells showed that one of the chromosomes of the trisomic set displays DRT (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kost-Alimova et al., 2004</a>). On the other hand, the finding that chromosome 7 mis-segregated in DLD1+13, but not in AF+13 cells raises the question as to whether types and rates of mis-segregation may vary in a cell type-dependent manner and whether copy number variations in the DLD1-derived cell lines may account for chromosome 7 mis-segregation. Given that the gain of chromosome 7 and chromosome 13 is commonly found in colon cancer (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ried et al., 2012</a>), a cell type-specific effect is plausible."

                                "text": "Although our cytokinesis-block assay data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>) show the higher mis-segregation rates to be limited to certain chromosomes, the chromosome count data show extensive karyotypic heterogeneity in the trisomic cell populations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>), thus suggesting that chromosome mis-segregation is more widespread than the cytokinesis-block assay reveals. One explanation is that the limited number of cells and chromosomes analyzed in the cytokinesis-block assay might only reveal differences in mis-segregation rates when such differences are large, but other methods, such as anaphase lagging chromosomes may be a better indicator of general mis-segregation rates. Moreover, some mis-segregation events may result in cell cycle arrest or cell death. Cases of chromosome mis-segregation leading to cell death would only be accounted for when examining cells undergoing mitosis, but not interphase cells. On the other hand, chromosome mis-segregation events leading to cell cycle arrest may only be appreciated when examining interphase nuclei, but not BN or mitotic cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>). These considerations argue for the use of multiple assays in studies aimed at dissecting the link between aneuploidy and CIN (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nicholson and Cimini, 2015</a>). We would also like to point out that chromosome mis-segregation events causing cell death or cell cycle arrest under tissue culture conditions, may not do so in the context of the tumor environment, suggesting that low level aneuploidy could be enough to drive CIN in cancer. Indeed, our data show that the complex aneuploidies observed in cancer cells are not a requirement for increased rates of lagging chromosomes and that at least some low grade and constitutional aneuploidies are sufficient to induce such an effect. This would be in agreement with previous observations showing that haploid budding yeast strains carrying disomies displayed increased genomic instability, and strains with different degrees of aneuploidy displayed variable degrees of chromosomal instability (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sheltzer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, previous reports have shown that lymphocytes of congenitally trisomic individuals displayed aneuploidies for chromosomes other than the congenitally trisomic ones (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reish et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2011</a>). Finally, random aneuploidy and senescent phenotypes were recently reported in aneuploid amniocytes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Biron-Shental et al., 2015</a>). Nonetheless, we do not exclude the possibility that certain aneuploidies may not be sufficient to induce chromosome mis-segregation."

It is important to note that, although we observed cytokinesis failure in AF+13, the frequency of tetraploid metaphase spreads in these cells was very low, as opposed to the DLD1+13 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This may be due to activation of a post-mitotic tetraploidy checkpoint in the AF+13 cells, but not in DLD1+13. Indeed, previous studies have shown a cell cycle arrest following cleavage failure in untransformed human cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andreassen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Krzywicka-Racka and Sluder, 2011</a>), whereas transformed cells continue cycling (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duelli et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Panopoulos et al., 2014</a>), but the triggering of a p53-dependent arrest in tetraploid cells still remains a matter of debate (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andreassen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Stukenberg, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Uetake and Sluder, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fujiwara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wong and Stearns, 2005</a>)."

These findings support previous studies showing that aneuploidy directly affects transcript and protein levels in various systems in a karyotype-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pollack et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Upender et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Pavelka et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ried et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stingele et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gemoll et al., 2013</a>). Previous studies in budding yeast also showed that aneuploid strains displayed karyotype-specific phenotypic variations that conferred resistance to a variety of drugs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pavelka et al., 2010b</a>). However, such phenotypic variations in aneuploid yeast strains were only revealed when cells were grown under specific selective conditions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pavelka et al., 2010b</a>), whereas we show here that such karyotype-dependent phenotypic changes can be intrinsic to the aneuploid cells. Although some studies have shown that aneuploidy can have overall deleterious effects on cell fitness (<a href=\"#bib67\">Torres et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Williams et al., 2008</a>), we provide strong evidence that specific aneuploidies can also induce specific phenotypes, which could, under certain conditions, provide a selective advantage. This particular concept was recently exploited to demonstrate that in fungi, certain drug treatments can lead to the evolution of populations with defined aneuploid karyotypes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). In the particular case observed in our study, one could also envision how the increase in tolerance to aneuploidy that tetraploidy was recently shown to confer (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dewhurst et al., 2014</a>) could enable the evolution of specific aneuploid karyotypes that may allow cells to overcome the detrimental impact of aneuploidy on cellular fitness (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gordon et al., 2012</a>). Karyotype-specific phenotypic changes such as those observed in our study can also explain the recurrent aneuploidies that are found in tumors from certain anatomical sites (e.g., gain of chromosome 13 and loss of chromosome 18 in colon cancer [<a href=\"#bib53\">Ried et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nicholson and Cimini, 2013</a>]). Indeed, aneuploidies for certain chromosomes may result in phenotypes that confer a selective advantage at a certain site (e.g., breast), but not at a different one (e.g., colon). And this could explain why, despite the high degrees of aneuploidy and the extensive karyotypic heterogeneity, the distribution of aneuploidies in different cancers is not completely random (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nicholson and Cimini, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ried et al., 2012</a>)."

For the cytokinesis-block assay, cells were treated with 3 \u03bcg/ml dihydrocytochalasin B (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, MO, USA) for 24 hr before fixation, and the experiment was repeated at least three independent times. Prior to being processed for FISH staining, cytokinesis-blocked cells were fixed according to previously published protocols: a standard FISH protocol (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nicholson and Duesberg, 2009</a>) was used for all cells; an alternative (3-D FISH) protocol (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cremer et al., 2008</a>) was used in some experiments with DLD1, DLD1+7, and DLD1+13 cells. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs using three to six BAC sequences specific to each region were made for the following four probes: <i>CDX2</i> on chromosome 13q12, <i>MET</i> on chromosome 7q31, <i>CHEK1</i> on chromosome 11q24, and <i>TERC</i> on chromosome 3q26. The BAC clone contigs were labeled by nick translation with Spectrum Orange-dUTP (Abbott Laboratories; IL, USA) for CDX2, Dy-505-dUTP (Dyomics; Jena, Germany) for MET, Spectrum Orange-dUTP (Abbott Laboratories; IL, USA) for <i>CHEK1</i>, and Dy-505-dUTP (Dyomics; Jena, Germany) for <i>TERC</i>. Dual color human whole chromosome paint probes were generated in-house using PCR labeling techniques. Chromosome 7 was labeled with Spectrum Orange (Abbott Laboratories; Chicago, IL) and chromosome 13 was labeled with Dy505 (Dyomics; Jena, Germany). Additionally, commercial locus-specific FISH probes for chromosomes 7, 11, 19 (red 5-ROX dUTP) and 12, 13, 18 (green 5-fluorescein dUTP) were also used (Empire Genomics; Buffalo, NY, USA). The probe mixtures were co-denatured with the coverslips at 72\u00b0C for 5 min before being placed in a moist chamber at 37\u00b0C for two nights. After two nights, the coverslips were washed in 2XSSC for 5 min and then mounted on microscope slides with mounting media (Vectashield; CA, USA) and DAPI."

Are the lagging chromosomes in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> occurring specifically in tetraploid cells? This could be tested by sorting a 2N population from each cell line and looking for laggards.

In particular in the light of the main finding of the manuscript that aneuploidy facilitates further chromosomal instability it would be very useful to know the true karyotypic variability of the analyzed cell lines (in particular when specifically the trisomic chromosome should be affected). The authors should at least provide percentage of trisomic cells within the population and show for example by multicolor FISH or by SNP arrays that no other recurrent aneuploidy occurred during the passaging. Also, providing the passage number would be useful. In the Materials and methods it is described that three cases of constitutional trisomy 13 and three diploid controls were used in the study. Is the result presented in figures as AF and AF+13 an average of these three different cell populations, or is it one example?"

Thus, Spartin may be upregulated in part as a general consequence of aneuploidy, and not simply because of its increased copy number. Alternatively, is the region 13q.13.3 amplified in DLD1+13?"

However, this should not be surprising as the degree of CIN may scale up with the degree of aneuploidy. (ii) The cell type used in the Valind et al. study may also partly explain the difference between their data and other studies, such as studies using peripheral blood lymphocytes of Turner and Down syndrome patients (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reish et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Reish et al., 2011</a>). (iii) Although Valind et al. analyzed more karyotypes, we examined more chromosomes and used several different approaches, as opposed to the single experimental approach used by Valind et al. We believe that a major reason for the discrepant conclusions reached by studies published over the years may be the difference in approaches used to assess CIN. When looking at cells undergoing mitosis (as we did in this study), one can directly assess the mis-segregation rates. However, mis-segregating cells may or may not divide further. Cell types in which mis-segregation does not cause a cell cycle arrest will \u201camplify\u201d the aneuploidy by producing aneuploid daughter cells that will, in turn, keep dividing. In this case, using interphase FISH would be good enough to determine that aneuploidy promotes chromosome mis-segregation. However, if the cells produced after a mis-segregation event stop dividing, interphase FISH will largely underestimate the ability of aneuploidy to promote chromosome mis-segregation. In more extreme cases, mis-segregation could even result in cell death, and this again would result in very low levels of CIN as measured by interphase FISH even in the presence of high rates of chromosome mis- segregation. Thus, cell type-specific differences in aneuploidy-induced cell cycle arrest or cell death may explain the discrepancies between different studies. We believe that one strength of our study is the use of several different approaches to investigate the role of aneuploidy in causing chromosome mis-segregation and karyotipic heterogeneity/CIN. The points summarized here are now extensively discussed in the manuscript (please see the Discussion section)."

We have revised the text throughout and we think it is now clear that, based on our data, we conclude that aneuploidy, regardless of the identity of the aneuploid chromosome, can promote chromosome mis-segregation. Our second conclusion is that different aneuploidies confer different phenotypes. In our study, we identified one such karyotype-phenotype connection by identifying a link between trisomy 13 and cytokinesis failure. To better get this point across, we have also slightly changed the title of the manuscript from \u201cAneuploidy causes karyotype-dependent phenotypes in human cells\u201d to \u201cAneuploidy causes chromosome mis-segregation and karyotype-dependent phenotypes in human cells.\u201d Finally, we think that the experiment suggested by the reviewers would have been a nice addition to our study, and therefore we attempted it.
