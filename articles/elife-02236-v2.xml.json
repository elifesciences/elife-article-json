                    "text": "Cell-based studies showed that several Mdm2-binding ribosomal proteins, upon overexpression, stabilize and activate p53. In contrast, here we show in a mouse knockout study that Mdm2-binding ribosomal protein S27-like (Rps27l), upon disruption, activates p53. Germline inactivation of <i>Rps27l</i> triggers ribosomal stress to stabilize Mdm2, which degrades Mdm4 to reduce Mdm2-Mdm4 E3 ligase towards p53, leading to p53-dependent apoptotic depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and postnatal death, which is rescued by <i>Trp53</i> deletion. Paradoxically, while increased p53 is expected to inhibit tumorigenesis, <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>;Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice develop lymphomas at higher incidence with p53 loss-of-heterozygosity and severe genome aneuploidy, suggesting that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption impose a selection pressure against p53. Thus, Rps27l has dual functions in p53 regulation: under <i>Trp53</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> background, <i>Rps27l</i> disruption triggers ribosomal stress to induce p53 and apoptosis, whereas under <i>Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> background, <i>Rps27l</i> disruption triggers genomic instability and <i>Trp53</i> deletion to promote tumorigenesis. Our study provides a new paradigm of p53 regulation."

                    "text": "Cell-based studies showed that several Mdm2-binding ribosomal proteins, upon overexpression, stabilize and activate p53. In contrast, here we show in a mouse knockout study that Mdm2-binding ribosomal protein S27-like (Rps27l), upon disruption, activates p53. Germline inactivation of <i>Rps27l</i> triggers ribosomal stress to stabilize Mdm2, which degrades Mdm4 to reduce Mdm2-Mdm4 E3 ligase towards p53, leading to p53-dependent apoptotic depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and postnatal death, which is rescued by <i>Trp53</i> deletion. Paradoxically, while increased p53 is expected to inhibit tumorigenesis, <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>;Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice develop lymphomas at higher incidence with p53 loss-of-heterozygosity and severe genome aneuploidy, suggesting that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption impose a selection pressure against p53. Thus, Rps27l has dual functions in p53 regulation: under <i>Trp53</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> background, <i>Rps27l</i> disruption triggers ribosomal stress to induce p53 and apoptosis, whereas under <i>Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> background, <i>Rps27l</i> disruption triggers genomic instability and <i>Trp53</i> deletion to promote tumorigenesis. Our study provides a new paradigm of p53 regulation."

However, if the damage is too severe and cannot be repaired, p53 essentially causes the cell to kill itself, via a process called apoptosis. Furthermore, if a cell has problems building new copies of its protein-making machinery, some of the parts (called ribosomal proteins) that make up these molecular machines can also lead to p53 being activated."

Upon induction by p53, Mdm2 inactivates p53 through at least two main mechanisms: (a) binding to p53 at its transactivation domain and blocking its transactivation activity, and (b) serving as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to promote a rapid degradation of p53 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Haupt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Honda et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kubbutat et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Honda and Yasuda, 2000</a>). Thus, p53-Mdm2 forms an auto-regulatory feedback loop to keep p53 levels under control (<a href=\"#bib85\">Wu et al., 1993</a>). Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that oncogenic activity of Mdm2 is mainly attributable to its binding to and degrading p53 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jones et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Montes de Oca Luna et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">de Rozieres et al., 2000</a>). The key role of Mdm2 E3 ligase activity in controlling p53 levels in a physiological setting was further demonstrated by a knock-in study in which introduction of a ligase dead <i>Mdm2</i><sup><i>C462A</i></sup> mutant results in embryonic lethality, that like <i>Mdm2</i> deletion, can be fully rescued by simultaneous <i>Trp53</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib36\">Itahana et al., 2007</a>)."

Moreover, Mdm4 forms a tight 1:1 complex with Mdm2 via their respective C-terminal RING finger domains (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sharp et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tanimura et al., 1999</a>), and the Mdm2-Mdm4 heterodimers are the preferred dimer form, compared to the Mdm2-Mdm2 or Mdm4-Mdm4 homodimers (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kostic et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, Mdm4 is a direct substrate of Mdm2 for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation (<a href=\"#bib17\">de Graaf et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kawai et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Pan and Chen, 2003</a>).

We and the others found that RPS27L is a direct p53 inducible target (<a href=\"#bib30\">He and Sun, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Li et al., 2007</a>).

Furthermore, RPS27L competes with p53 for MDM2 binding, consequently inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation and degradation (<a href=\"#bib86\">Xiong et al., 2011</a>). Thus, RPS27L interplays with the MDM2-p53 axis to regulate p53 activity. Although several ribosomal proteins have been previously shown to bind and inhibit MDM2, causing p53 activation (<a href=\"#bib89\">Zhang and Lu, 2009</a>), with RPS7 and RPL26 being MDM2 substrates as well (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ofir-Rosenfeld et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Zhu et al., 2009</a>), RPS27L is the first and only known ribosomal-like protein that is a direct p53 inducible target, a MDM2 substrate, and a regulator of the MDM2-p53 axis.

The H&amp;E; staining revealed that the bone marrow derived from <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice have much reduced cellularity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Likewise, the <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> thymus showed a remarkable reduction in the thymic cortex, and thymocytes in cortical and cortical-medullary junction areas undergo apoptosis with accumulation of small irregular nuclear fragments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, arrows). Induction of apoptosis was further confirmed by the immunofluorenscent staining with antibody against cleaved caspase-3 in both thymocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) and bone marrow cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Moreover, apoptosis in thymus was readily detectable by immunoblotting, which showed increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and pro-apoptotic protein Puma (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). An increased apoptosis, as reflected by Annexin V staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), but not reduced proliferation, as reflected by BrdU incorporation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>) was also seen in myeloid progenitors (MP), derived from E14.5 <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> fetal livers.

The FACS analysis of <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> fetal livers revealed a substantial reduction in number of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)-containing LSK (Lin<sup>\u2212</sup>/Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/c-Kit<sup>+</sup>) population, and MP population, consisting of common myeloid progenitor (CMP), granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP), and megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitor (MEP) cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To determine the viability and functionality of <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> HSPCs, we performed a non-competitive reconstitution assay to see whether these stem cells, while reduced in number, are still sufficient to rescue the bone marrow failure of recipient mice which were sterilized by a lethal dose of radiation. A total of 2 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> fetal liver cells from either <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> or <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos were used. Remarkably, while HSPCs from wild type fetal liver cells completely reconstituted sterilized bone marrow and fully rescued the recipient mice, cells from <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> fetal livers were unable to do so, leading to a 100% death of recipient mice within 10 days of reconstitution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To eliminate possibility that the failure in rescue is due to an insufficient number of stem cells in <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> fetal livers, which is about 50% of the <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> control (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, 0.005% vs 0.01% of total liver), we repeated this non-competitive reconstitution assay, using three times more fetal liver cells (6 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>) from the <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos than that (2 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>) from the <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> or <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> embryos. Again, the stem cells from <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> fetal livers failed to rescue sterilized recipient mice with 100% death within 12 days post reconstitution, whereas those from wild type or heterozygous fetal liver caused a 100% rescue (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), indicating an intrinsic defect.

By immunoblotting, we found that both basal and radiation-induced levels of p53 and p53 target protein Puma are higher in fetal livers derived from <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos than in those from <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Likewise, the levels of p53 and Puma are also higher in <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> spleen and brain tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Furthermore, we observed a moderate increase in the levels of p53 and its two well-known targets, Mdm2 and p21 in MEFs derived from <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> embryos than in those from <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Finally, the p53 levels, induced by (a) ribosomal stress inducer, actinomycin D (Act D), (b) DNA damaging agent, etoposide (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), or (c) ionizing radiation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), were also higher in <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs than in <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> MEFs. It is worth noting that increased p53 in <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs is unlikely due to enhanced DNA damage response, given the similar phosphorylation levels of \u03b3H2AX and Chk1 between MEFs of the two genotypes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Taken together, our results clearly showed that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption causes an increase in p53 levels in multiple organs and cell types, and that increased p53 is transcriptionally active to induce the expression of its downstream targets, namely p21, Mdm2 and Puma."

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis using four independent sets of MEFs revealed that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption did not increase p53 mRNA level, but as expected, increased mRNA levels of two p53 targets, Mdm2 and p21, due to p53 transactivation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine labeling experiment in two independent pairs of MEFs showed that the rate of p53 synthesis is similar regardless of <i>Rps27l</i> status (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption does not alter the p53 protein synthesis. We then focused our attention on the rate of p53 degradation by measuring the p53 protein half-life. We found that p53 half-life was doubled from \u223c10 min to \u223c25 min in MEFs upon <i>Rps27l</i> disruption (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) due to reduced ubiquitylation and degradation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Because the major E3 ligase for p53 degradation is Mdm2, we performed an in vitro ubiquitylation assay, using, as the E3 source, the Mdm2 complex immuno-precipitated from the paired <i>Rps27l</i> MEFs, and found that the p53 ubiquitylation was reduced in <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/<i>\u2212</i></sup> MEFs substantially (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), indicating a reduced Mdm2 ligase activity toward p53."

Indeed, total cellular levels of Mdm4 were significantly reduced in several independent isolates of <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/<i>\u2212</i></sup> MEFs, as compared to the <i>Rps27l</i><sup>+/+</sup> littermates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). We then determined the binding affinity of Mdm2 and Mdm4 by the two-reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) assay in <i>Rps27l</i><sup>+/+</sup> vs <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/<i>\u2212</i></sup> MEFs under unstressed native condition in the absence of proteasome inhibitor MG132. Although the total cellular level of Mdm4 was much lower in <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> than in <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> MEFs with a ratio of 0.12 vs 1, the level of Mdm2-bound Mdm4 (pulled-down by Mdm2 IP) was much higher with a ratio of 0.75 vs 1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, left). Reciprocally (Mdm4 IP), the level of Mdm4-bound Mdm2 was also higher with a ratio of 0.32 vs 1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, right). Thus, although a much lower total levels of Mdm4 in <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/<i>\u2212</i></sup> MEFs, most of Mdm4 molecules were found in the complex with Mdm2. These results clearly demonstrated that in the absence of Rps27l, Mdm2 actually has a higher binding affinity towards Mdm4, which might facilitate Mdm2-mediated Mdm4 degradation, leading to a decreased level of Mdm4, compromised Mdm2-Mdm4 ligase activity towards p53, and consequent p53 accumulation."

Compared to the Ad-GFP controls, acute depletion of <i>Rps27l</i> caused an elevated Mdm2, starting at 24 hr post Ad-Cre infection and lasting up to 96 hr, followed by depletion of Mdm4, starting at 48 hr. A moderate accumulation of p53 was not seen until the later time points, starting at 72\u201384 hr following Ad-Cre infection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Furthermore, Mdm2 accumulation, followed by Mdm4 reduction, is independent of p53, since a similar changing pattern was seen when <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup>;<i>Trp53</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs were infected with Ad-Cre (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

Intercrossing of <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/</i>\u2212</sup><i>;Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice gave rise to mice with the <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> background in combination with three p53 genotypes.

Thus, p53 increase upon <i>Rps27l</i> disruption is fully responsible for phenotypic defects observed in <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice."

Whole body necropsy revealed that out of 14 <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup><i>;Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice died within a period of 400 days (50% death rate), seven developed T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>), one developed T-cell lymphoma detected in tissues of thymus, lymph node and spleen (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and one developed B-cell lymphoma seen in a much enlarged lymph node (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The remaining mice had enlarged liver and/or spleen (not shown). The results indicate that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption accelerated the formation of spontaneous lymphomas under the <i>Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> background. We then collected more lymphoma tissues from <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup><i>;Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice at age of 4\u20136 months for <i>Trp53</i> genotyping and found that the wild type <i>Trp53</i> allele was deleted in 29 out of 30 (97%) lymphomas genotyped (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), indicating that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption imposed the selection pressure against wild-type <i>Trp53</i>. We further measured the genome integrity of these lymphoma cells by metaphase chromosome spread and found a high degree of aneuploidy in up to 63% of total population (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Centromere\u2013centromere fusions were also seen in some diploid lymphoma cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, arrow). Thus, <i>Rps27l</i> disruption causes genomic instability and <i>Trp53</i> deletion, eventually leading to lymphoma development. To determine which event (genomic instability vs <i>Trp53</i> deletion) occurs first, we performed the same metaphase chromosome spread in four independent pairs of early passage primary MEFs and found a significant higher rate of chromosomal aneuploidy in <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup><i>;Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> cells than in <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup><i>;Trp53</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> cells (30% vs 15%) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>), although wild-type <i>Trp53</i> was retained, as measured by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). Thus, <i>Rps27l</i> disruption triggers genomic instability prior to <i>Trp53</i> deletion and the cells with subsequent <i>Trp53</i> deletion are selected, which outgrow to form spontaneous lymphoma. We further performed the same metaphase chromosome spread in MEFs with the genotype of <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup><i>;Trp53</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> (n = 7) vs <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup><i>;Trp53</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> (n = 3) and found a same low rate of aneuploidy at \u223c10% in both group of MEFs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>).

By both noncompetitive and competitive reconstruction assays, we clearly demonstrated that the HSPCs from <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> fetal livers were unable to reconstitute sterilized bone marrow. Rescuing of these defects by simultaneous deletion of a single or both alleles of <i>Trp53</i> indicates that p53 plays a causal role and that a moderate p53 increase is responsible for and sufficient to cause the depletion of these HSPCs via inducing apoptosis. It is noting worthy that although, unlike homozygous <i>Trp53</i> deletion, heterozygous <i>Trp53</i> deletion fails to completely rescue the defects in number or percentage of HSPCs in the bone marrows in p18 weaning mice, it is still sufficient to rescue the postnatal growth retardation and death."

                                "text": "An increasing list of ribosomal proteins (RPs) has been shown in numerous in vitro cell culture studies to bind to Mdm2 and stabilize p53, thus acting as a p53 activator (<a href=\"#bib89\">Zhang and Lu, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). It was also reported that siRNA silencing of some ribosomal proteins, such as L23, triggered ribosomal stress, leading to p53 stabilization and activation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jin et al., 2004</a>). We previously showed that RPS27L is an MDM2 binding protein whose overexpression inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation, whereas its silencing reduces p53 in some cancer lines (e.g., A549 and SJSA), but not in others (e.g., SY5Y, MCF7, U2OS, HCT116, and RKO) (<a href=\"#bib86\">Xiong et al., 2011</a>) (data not shown), suggesting RPS27L might act as a p53 activator in a cancer cell dependent manner. Here we reported that Rps27l is indeed a ribosomal protein, whose depletion triggers ribosomal stress (as evidenced by B23 nucleoplasm staining and enhanced RPs-Mdm2 binding) with moderate reduction in ribosomal RNA processing, but no effect on general protein synthesis. We further found, using <i>Rps27l</i> KO model, that unlike in vitro cell culture studies which showed that almost all known MDM2-binding ribosomal proteins acts as p53 activators upon overexpression (<a href=\"#bib89\">Zhang and Lu, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>), Rps27l actually activates p53 upon disruption, given the fact that (a) <i>Rps27l</i> deletion caused p53 accumulation in multiple organs as well as in primary MEFs, and (b) all <i>Rps27l</i>-null phenotypes, such as depletion of HPSCs and bone marrow, growth retardation and postnatal death, can be fully rescued by <i>Trp53</i> deletion. It is conceivable that the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo studies is likely attributable to the fact that most cell culture studies were conducted (a) in human cancer cell lines with multiple genetic alterations, (b) under artificial overexpression and/or (c) partial RNA silencing conditions. Nevertheless, through this knockout study we conclusively showed that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption induces p53 under the physiological conditions in a manner independent of DNA damage. It is also interesting in our finding that consistent with enhanced binding of Mdm2-Rpl11, but not Mdm2-Rpl5, p53 induction triggered by <i>Rps27l</i> disruption is dependent of Rpl11, but independent of Rpl5, although both are key ribosomal proteins, released from nucleolus upon ribosomal stress, to inhibit Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Golomb et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, we made a novel observation that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption caused an increased binding of Mdm2 selectively to Rpl11, Rpl23, Rps7, Rps14, and Rps27, but not to Rpl5, Rps27a, and Rps19. Whether these RPs with enhanced Mdm2 binding indeed contribute to p53 activation in <i>Rps27l-deficient</i> MEFs is an interesting topic warranting future investigation."

                                "text": "Our <i>Rps27l</i> acute depletion experiment conducted in both <i>Trp53</i>-wt and <i>Trp53</i>-null MEFs clearly showed a sequential change in the levels of Mdm2 (increase), Mdm4 (decrease) and p53 (increase), indicating that (1) <i>Rps27l</i> depletion induces p53-independent Mdm2 increase and (2) increased Mdm2 fails to degrade p53. Our follow-up experiments mechanistically addressed these two fundamental questions: how Mdm2 is increased upon <i>Rps27l</i> disruption and why increased Mdm2 fails to degrade p53 in the absence of Rps27l. For first question, we found that while Rps27l has no direct effect on Mdm2 mRNA transcription, it indeed negatively regulates the Mdm2 protein stability with Mdm2 protein half-life being extended or shortened upon <i>Rps27l</i> depletion or overexpression, respectively. It is conceivable that in wt cells under unstressed conditions, Rps27l binds to Mdm2 on its acidic domain (<a href=\"#bib86\">Xiong et al., 2011</a>), which has potential to block the binding of other ribosomal proteins (e.g., L11/S7/S27a/S14) to Mdm2 on the same domain (internal competition). Upon <i>Rps27l</i> disruption, which triggers ribosomal stress, other ribosomal proteins are released from nucleoli and bind to Mdm2 on an unoccupied acidic domain to inhibit Mdm2 self-ubiquitylation, leading to its stabilization. To address the second question, we showed that the total Mdm4 level was significantly lower in <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> than in <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> MEFs. We also showed by both loss-of-function and rescue-of-function studies that Mdm2-mediated Mdm4 ubiquitylation and degradation is negatively regulated by Rps27l, being enhanced upon <i>Rps27l</i> depletion and reduced upon RPS27L overexpression. Thus, enhanced Mdm2-RPs binding (such as Mdm2-Rpl11 binding) as a result of ribosomal stress in response to <i>Rps27l</i> disruption would facilitate Mdm2-dependent Mdm4 degradation, which is consistent with a previous observation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gilkes et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, we found that although Mdm2-Mdm4 has a better affinity upon <i>Rps27l</i> deletion, a much reduced amount of Mdm4 in <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MEFs results in a reduced level of Mdm2-bound Mdm4, thus lesser formation of the Mdm2-Mdm4 heterodimer. Given that Mdm2-Mdm4 heterodimer is the most stable and active form of E3 ligase for targeted p53 degradation, as shown in both in vitro (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kawai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wang et al., 2011</a>) and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Francoz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Garcia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Huang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pant et al., 2011</a>) studies, compromised Mdm2-Mdm4 ligase activity in <i>Rps27l</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MEFs leads to a reduced p53 ubiquitylation and degradation, consequently an extended p53 protein half-life and increased p53 levels."

While <i>Mdm2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>;<i>Trp53</i><sup><i>515C/515C</i></sup> mice also die by postnatal day 13, the death is mainly attributable to depletion of HPSCs in postnatal bone marrows, but not in fetal liver due to p53<sup>R172P</sup>-induced ROS generation, and subsequent senescence and cell death (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbas et al., 2010</a>). In contrast, <i>Rps27l</i> disruption causes a moderate increase of p53 which is insufficient to induce embryonic lethality, but sufficient to induce postnatal lethality, resulting from apoptotic depletion of HPSCs in both fetal liver and neonatal bone marrow.

For example, liver specific deletion of <i>Rps6</i> prevented hepatocytes from re-entering the cell cycle after partial hepatectomy due to increased p53, which can be rescued by <i>Trp53</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib79\">Volarevic et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fumagalli et al., 2009</a>). Developmental defects derived from tissue specific deletion of <i>Rps6</i> in T cells or oocytes was largely due to p53 activation, and rescued by <i>Trp53</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sulic et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Panic et al., 2006</a>). Likewise, p53 activation was involved in defective \u03b1\u03b2 T cell development in <i>Rpl22</i> knockout mice and this deficiency was completely rescued by <i>Trp53</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson et al., 2007</a>). p53 activation was also involved in congenital malformations in <i>Rpl24</i>-deficient mice which were largely rescued by p53 ablation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barkic et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, phenotypes such as cerebellar ataxia, pancytopenia and epidermal hyperpigmentation seen in <i>Rpl27a</i> mutant mice was rescued in a haploinsufficient <i>Trp53</i> background (<a href=\"#bib75\">Terzian et al., 2011</a>), whereas the dark skin as a result of p53-dependent epidermal melanocytosis seen in Rps6, Rps19, or Rps20 mutant mice was also rescued by <i>Trp53</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib55\">McGowan et al., 2008</a>). Finally, p53 appears to be causally related to the defects seen in the Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), a congenital disorder of craniofacial development arising from mutations of TCOF1, which encodes the nucleolar phosphoprotein Treacle and whose haploinsufficiency perturbs mature ribosome biogenesis to trigger p53 activation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jones et al., 2008</a>)."

Hematological abnormalities associated with increased apoptosis in bone marrow progenitor cells can be rescued only by homozygous <i>Trp53</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barlow et al., 2010</a>). To our best knowledge, our study is the first targeted inactivation of a single Mdm2-binding ribosomal protein in mouse and demonstrated that (1) Rps27l is required in vivo to keep p53 in check and (2) developmental defects and postnatal death upon <i>Rps27l</i> disruption are rescued by the deletion of single <i>Trp53</i> allele, indicating that moderate increase of p53 is sufficient to tip the life-death balance to the death. It is worth noting that postnatal death upon <i>Rps27l</i> disruption occurs under the wt background of its family member, <i>Rps27</i> as well as other ribosomal genes encoding all known Mdm2-binding ribosomal proteins. Thus, for hematopoiesis, Rps27l plays a non-redundant role in reducing p53 levels via stabilizing the Mdm2-Mdm4 complex."

Thus, its loss or decreased expression by any means would exacerbate genomic instability and provide selection pressure against p53, eventually leading to tumor development. Potential tumor suppressive function of RPS27L is further supported by an observation that high level of RPS27L expression predicted a better prognosis in colon cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huang et al., 2013</a>)."

The acquisition of genomic instability in early passage <i>Rps27l</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup>;p53<sup><i>+/-</i></sup> MEFs (prior to the loss of the second p53 allele) could be due to a selective pressure against p53 upstream regulators (for example ARF).

The loss of Rps27L appears to also somehow affect the binding affinity between Mdm2 and Mdm4.

Does the overexpression of Rps27L in MEFs suppress WT levels of p53? Does Rps27L normally prohibit other ribosomal proteins from stabilizing Mdm2? A logical conclusion from this study is that in the presence of normal levels of Rps27L there is no cellular stress (defective ribosome biogenesis or protein synthesis?) that triggers the p53 response."

We therefore determined the binding affinity of Mdm2 and Mdm4 by two-reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) assay in <i>Rps27l</i>-wt vs. <i>Rps27l</i>-null MEFs under unstressed native condition in the absence of proteasome inhibitor MG132.

These results clearly demonstrated that in the absence of Rps27l, Mdm2 actually has a higher binding affinity towards Mdm4, which might facilitate Mdm2-mediated Mdm4 degradation, leading to a decreased level of Mdm4. Thus, reduced level of Mdm2-bound Mdm4 in <i>Rps27l</i>-null MEFs is mainly due to reduced total level of Mdm4, not due to reduced binding affinity.
