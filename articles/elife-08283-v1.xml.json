In most cases these changes do not involve any change in the topology of the protein: that is, the relative positions of the secondary structure elements of the protein (such as alpha helices and beta sheets) do not change. A family of proteins called HORMA domain proteins has emerged as a fascinating exception to this empirical rule. Mad2, the best-studied member of this family, changes between an open state that is inactive and a closed (active) state with a different topology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Crucial details of this process have remained unclear but now, in <i>eLife</i>, Kevin Corbett and co-workers\u2014including Qiaozhen Ye as first author\u2014shed new light on the role played by an enzyme called TRIP13/PCH-2 in this particular conformational change (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ye et al., 2015</a>)."

The structural elements highlighted in pale yellow have the same relative positions in the two states; the elements highlighted in brown have different relative positions. The open form (red) is converted to the closed form (bright yellow) by a closure motif (blue rectangle) within a Cdc20 protein. This process is strongly promoted by kinetochores that have not yet bound to the spindle (red), but not by those that are already bound (green). This results in the formation of the effector complex (containing closed Mad2 and Cdc20) that suppresses the separation of the chromosomes. A protein called p31<sup>comet</sup> acts as a bridge to allow an enzyme called TRIP13/PCH-2 to use ATP hydrolysis to dissociate this effector complex, which is very stable."

This process is monitored by a set of proteins known as checkpoint proteins."

This pool of open Mad2 is not maintained through the production of new protein, so the most plausible explanation is that it comes from the continuous conversion of closed Mad2. How does this take place? Previous studies have established that the hydrolysis of ATP is required to disassemble the checkpoint effector (<a href=\"#bib6\">Miniowitz-Shemtov et al., 2010</a>): hydrolysis of ATP releases energy, but the specific steps that require this energy had not been identified."

By recreating the reaction in the laboratory with purified components, Ye et al.\u2014who are based at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, the Scripps Institute and the University of California, San Diego\u2014now go further by showing that the TRIP13/PCH-2 enzyme binds to closed Mad2, which is then converted to open Mad2 in a manner that depends on ATP hydrolysis and on the activity of p31<sup>comet</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

For instance, an important subclass of these enzymes\u2014known as the disaggregases\u2014can separate proteins that have formed aggregates within the cell: this allows these proteins to refold with assistance from chaperone proteins. Another subclass assists in the breakdown of proteins by associating with protease enzymes, and a third subclass promotes the disassembly of stable protein complexes and the recycling of their subunits. TRIP13/PCH-2 appears to belong to the latter class, but Ye et al. reveal that its high-resolution three-dimensional structure is more typical of the disaggregases."
