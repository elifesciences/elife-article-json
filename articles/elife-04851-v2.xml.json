In this study, we demonstrate that direct TGF-\u03b2 signaling to CD4 T cells is important for the formation of influenza-specific Tfh cells, GC reactions, and development of isotype-switched, flu-specific antibody responses. Early during infection, TGF-\u03b2 signaling suppressed the expression of the high affinity IL-2 receptor \u03b1 chain (CD25) on virus-specific CD4 T cells, which tempered IL-2 signaling and STAT5 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in Tfh precursor CD4 T cells. Inhibition of mTOR allowed for the differentiation of Tfh cells in the absence of TGF-\u03b2R signaling, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 insulates Tfh progenitor cells from IL-2-delivered mTOR signals, thereby promoting Tfh differentiation during acute viral infection. These findings identify a new pathway critical for the generation of Tfh cells and humoral responses during respiratory viral infections."

In this study, we demonstrate that direct TGF-\u03b2 signaling to CD4 T cells is important for the formation of influenza-specific Tfh cells, GC reactions, and development of isotype-switched, flu-specific antibody responses. Early during infection, TGF-\u03b2 signaling suppressed the expression of the high affinity IL-2 receptor \u03b1 chain (CD25) on virus-specific CD4 T cells, which tempered IL-2 signaling and STAT5 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in Tfh precursor CD4 T cells. Inhibition of mTOR allowed for the differentiation of Tfh cells in the absence of TGF-\u03b2R signaling, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 insulates Tfh progenitor cells from IL-2-delivered mTOR signals, thereby promoting Tfh differentiation during acute viral infection. These findings identify a new pathway critical for the generation of Tfh cells and humoral responses during respiratory viral infections."

In contrast, Tfh cells primarily remain in secondary lymphoid tissues where they communicate with B cells in germinal centers (GC) to facilitate antibody affinity maturation and isotype switching. Tfh cells express substantially lower levels of T-bet, and instead of Blimp1 they express the TF Bcl6. Some pro-inflammatory cytokines induced during infection, such as IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b1\u03b2, and IL-2, promote Th1 differentiation; however, the signals required for Tfh differentiation during viral infection have not been as well characterized."

Following activation, Tfh precursor cells start to express the TF Bcl6 and the chemokine receptor CXCR5, as they downregulate CCR7 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Johnston et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Poholek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pepper et al., 2011</a>). These events allow for the migration of activated Tfh precursor cells toward the interfollicular zone and T-B border where they again meet peptide-MHC as well as other costimulatory ligands such as Inducible T cell Costimulator ligand (ICOSL) from B cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Breitfeld et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schaerli et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hardtke et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kerfoot et al., 2011</a>). These interactions result in the further upregulation of Bcl6, migration into the GC, and ability to assist B cells in affinity maturation and proper isotype switching (<a href=\"#bib44\">Poholek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baumjohann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 2011</a>). In addition to these cell surface ligand-receptor pairings, cytokines play critical roles in the full differentiation of effector Tfh cells during infection. Cytokines utilizing STAT3 signaling pathways including IL-6, IL-21, and IL-27 have been implicated in driving Tfh differentiation, but may have overlapping or compensatory effects depending on the immunizing agent and inflammatory environment (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ma et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ray et al., 2014</a>). For example, IL-6 appears to act on early anti-viral Tfh precursors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choi et al., 2013a</a>), and while it is not absolutely required for fully differentiated Tfh effector cells during acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) infection (<a href=\"#bib44\">Poholek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eto et al., 2011</a>), it does promote the sustained activation of Tfh cells during chronic LCMV infection (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harker et al., 2011</a>). Further, IL-27 is required for Tfh differentiation during protein immunization (<a href=\"#bib2\">Batten et al., 2010</a>), while IL-21 is sometimes also involved (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nurieva et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Vogelzang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eto et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Karnowski et al., 2012</a>). In addition to STAT3, STAT4 signaling via IL-12 may also promote early Tfh progenitor cells during infection (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nakayamada et al., 2011</a>) and appears to be critical for the differentiation of human Tfh cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schmitt et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2013</a>). However, STAT4 signals are absolutely required for the differentiation of Th1 cells, suggesting that additional signals are needed to repress the expression of the Th1 TFs T-bet and Blimp1 in Tfh progenitor cells."

Increased expression of the high affinity IL-2R\u03b1 chain CD25 on early effector CD4 T cells correlates with enhanced expression of the Th1 TFs T-bet and Blimp1 and lower levels of the Tfh TF Bcl6 and this is driven largely by IL-2-STAT5 signaling (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pepper et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Choi et al., 2013b</a>).

As an immune-suppressive factor, TGF-\u03b2 promotes the differentiation of peripherally derived regulatory T cells (pTreg) and inhibits the development of autoreactive T cell responses. In contrast, TGF-\u03b2 can also serve a pro-inflammatory role by inducing the differentiation of effector Th17 cells. T cell-specific ablation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, either via TGF-\u03b2RII deletion or expression of a dominant negative receptor, has demonstrated that direct TGF-\u03b2 signals are important for both Treg homeostasis and suppression of effector T cell activation and proliferation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Marie et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sanjabi et al., 2009</a>). The aberrant activation of effector cells in the absence of TGF-\u03b2 signals cannot be rescued by addition of Treg (<a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2006</a>), indicating that direct TGF-\u03b2 signaling on effector CD4 T cells is required to maintain their homeostasis. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b2 suppresses T-bet expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gorelik et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Park et al., 2005</a>) and the exuberant proliferation of T cells display Th1 attributes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ishigame et al., 2013</a>), demonstrating that TGF-\u03b2 has the capacity to suppress Th1 differentiation."

Specifically, we found that CD4 T cell-directed TGF-\u03b2 was a critical signal for anti-viral Tfh differentiation, GC B cell reactions, and isotype-switched antibody response during influenza infection. TGF-\u03b2 suppressed the expression of the high affinity IL-2R\u03b1 chain CD25, which restricted IL-2 signaling via STAT5 and mTOR in Tfh progenitor cells early during infection in vivo. Finally, we show that blockade of the mTOR signaling pathway can rescue Tfh differentiation of anti-viral CD4 T cells generated in the absence of TGF-\u03b2. Thus, we have identified that T cell-directed TGF-\u03b2 insulates Tfh precursor cells from IL-2 signals and plays a critical role in the generation of effector Tfh cells and high affinity, class-switched antibodies\u2014an essential source of protective immunity to this global health burden."

This analysis revealed a number of TGF-\u03b2-associated genes commonly found in Treg cells, including <i>Nt5e</i> (CD73), <i>Folr4</i> (folate receptor 4), <i>Foxp3</i>, and <i>Ikzf2</i> (Helios) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hill et al., 2007</a>), to be more highly expressed in PSLG1<sup>lo</sup> Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> T-bet<sup>lo</sup> CXCR5<sup>hi</sup> Tfh cells relative to the PSGL1<sup>hi</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> T-bet<sup>hi</sup> CXCR5<sup>lo</sup> Th1 cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marshall et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hale et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We first sought to determine if these results indicated that T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells, a recently described immune-suppressive Tfh population (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Linterman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wollenberg et al., 2011</a>), formed during acute LCMV infection. To assess this, we infected B6 or TCR transgenic Smarta (Stg) chimeras with acute LCMV Armstrong and monitored Tfh and Treg properties in either GP<sub>66\u201377</sub> tetramer<sup>+</sup> or Stg CD4 T cells by flow cytometry. Although we detected enhanced <i>FoxP3</i> mRNA in the Tfh cells from our microarray analysis, we did not identify any LCMV-specific CD4 T cells that expressed FoxP3 protein or other Treg-associated markers such as GITR, to the level of canonical CD25<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggested that LCMV-specific CD4 T cells do not differentiate into Tfr cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marshall et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Srivastava et al., 2014</a>). However, in agreement with the differential mRNA expression, we did find enhanced expression of several of the TGF-\u03b2- or Treg-associated proteins including CD73, folate receptor 4, and Helios on Tfh cells relative to the Th1 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hill et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Iyer et al., 2013</a>).

In order to assess the contribution of direct TGF-\u03b2 signals on the formation of anti-viral CD4 T cell subsets, we crossed TGF-\u03b2RII<sup>f/f</sup> CD4-cre mice to the Stg TCR transgenic mice. Fixing the TCR delays the onset of autoimmunity in the TGF-\u03b2RII<sup>f/f</sup> CD4-cre mice (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sanjabi and Flavell, 2010</a>); however, activated CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD4 T cells do emerge over time (data not shown). Therefore, when making chimeras, we adoptively transferred na\u00efve CD44<sup>lo</sup> TGF-\u03b2RII<sup>+/+</sup> CD4-cre<sup>+</sup> Stg cells (herein referred to as WT) or na\u00efve CD44<sup>lo</sup> TGF-\u03b2RII<sup>f/f</sup> CD4-cre<sup>+</sup> Stg cells (KO) into congenic C57BL/6 recipients and 1 day later infected the mice with the acute Armstrong strain of LCMV. Intriguingly, we found that direct TGF-\u03b2 promoted the differentiation of Tfh precursor cells at day 3 post infection (p.i.), such that there were about 1/3 fewer CD25<sup>lo</sup> CXCR5<sup>+</sup> Tfh precursor cells in the absence of direct TGF-\u03b2 signals (WT = 60.25% \u00b1 4, KO = 42% \u00b1 3.3) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Additionally, the TGF-\u03b2RII KO early effector CD4 T cells expressed more Th1 proteins Ly6C and T-bet and slightly lower Tfh TF Bcl6 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). However, by day 8 there was no phenotypic difference between TGF-\u03b2RII WT and KO CD4 T cells in the spleen (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). These data indicated that TGF-\u03b2 played a role in the early specification of splenic Tfh progenitor cells, but that other signals compensated for TGF-\u03b2 signaling over the course of a systemic LCMV infection."

Moreover, respiratory influenza infection induces transcription of TGF-\u03b2 and the influenza neuraminidase enzyme promotes the cleavage of latent TGF-\u03b2 complex into its bioactive form in the lung mucosa (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schultz-Cherry and Hinshaw, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carlson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Roberson et al., 2012</a>). To assess the contribution of TGF-\u03b2 on the anti-viral CD4 T cell response during a respiratory infection, we infected TGF-\u03b2RII WT and KO Stg chimeras i.n. with a recombinant influenza virus expressing the LCMV GP<sub>66\u201377</sub> epitope recognized by the Stg TCR (WSN-GP33/66) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Marsolais et al., 2008</a>). First, we confirmed that the phenotypic properties of influenza-specific CD4 T cells closely mirrored that of LCMV-specific CD4 T cell populations, and importantly, verified that the influenza-specific Stg cells were neither FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Treg nor Tfr cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, we found that the proportion and total number of PSGL1<sup>lo</sup> Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> and PD-1<sup>hi</sup> CXCR5<sup>hi</sup> Tfh cells in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node (MLN) were markedly reduced in the absence of direct TGF-\u03b2 signals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Furthermore, there was an increase in number of PSGL1<sup>hi</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> Th1 cells in all tissues examined (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Concomitant with the cell surface phenotypes, we found increased expression of the Th1 TF T-bet and reduced expression of the Tfh TF Bcl6 as well as increased production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in the TGF-\u03b2RII KO influenza-specific CD4 T cells compared to their WT counterparts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Finally, and potentially most importantly given their function to help B cells in the GC, we also detected fewer TGF-\u03b2RII KO Stg cells localized in PNA<sup>+</sup> GC in the MLN (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 is important for optimal trafficking of Tfh cells to GCs. Together, these data suggest that direct TGF-\u03b2 signaling was important for the generation of Tfh cells, while it suppressed Th1 differentiation during respiratory influenza virus infection."

Our Stg CD4 T cell adoptive transfer model, as described above, was not suitable to examine GC B cell and antibody responses because the endogenous host-derived CD4 T cells could provide B cell help in these chimeric mice. Therefore, we set up a \u2018B cell helpless system\u2019 using OT-II TCR transgenic mice as recipients because they have a fixed non-influenza-specific CD4 T cell compartment that cannot provide help to GC B cells during the infection. We chose to adoptively transfer polyclonal CD4 T cells in this system to provide a broad repertoire of influenza-specific na\u00efve precursors to provide B cell help. It should also be noted that we switched to the distal Lck-cre deletion strain, which is superior to the CD4-cre strain because of a small number of TGF-\u03b2R<sup>+</sup> \u2018escapees\u2019 that differentiate into nTreg during neonatal development and prevent autoimmunity in these mice (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang and Bevan, 2012</a>).

In accord with our findings for the TGF-\u03b2RII KO Stg cells, the donor (Thy1.2<sup>+</sup>) polyclonal activated (CD44<sup>hi</sup>) CD4 T cells lacking TGF-\u03b2RII also displayed impaired Tfh cell development.

Addition of recombinant TGF-\u03b2 (10 ng/ml) to Stg CD4 T cell cultures stimulated with GP<sub>66</sub> peptide in vitro did not inhibit T cell activation because the upregulation of CD25 and the proliferation rates of the CD4 T cells were comparable between cultures containing or lacking exogenous TGF-\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, TGF-\u03b2 profoundly affected the ability of the activated CD4 T cells to sustain CD25 expression and IL-2 responsiveness. That is, at day 2 post activation, the amount of surface CD25 and intracellular phospho-STAT5 (pSTAT5) after IL-2 stimulation was the same whether or not TGF-\u03b2 was present, but 1 day later, the T cells exposed to TGF-\u03b2 displayed considerably less CD25 and lower IL-2 responsiveness compared with those that were not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Next, we assessed whether TGF-\u03b2 modulates CD25 expression and IL-2 signaling in virus-specific CD4 T cells in vivo by comparing CD25, pSTAT5, and pS6 levels in TGF-\u03b2RII WT and KO Stg CD4 T cells isolated directly ex vivo from day 3 post LCMV infection, a setting in which Th1 progenitor cells are more frequent to facilitate analysis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

It should be noted that IL-2 is not the sole factor that activates mTOR in T cells and that the TCR and a variety of other pro-inflammatory cytokines and costimulatory ligands also utilize this signaling pathway. Interestingly, we found that rapamycin treatment rescued the differentiation of PSGL1<sup>lo</sup> Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> Tfh cells and suppressed the aberrant expansion of the PSGL1<sup>hi</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> Th1 cells that arise in the absence of direct TGF-\u03b2 signals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Consequently, T cell intrinsic TGF-\u03b2RII signaling is also required for GC reactions and isotype-switched antibody production during respiratory influenza virus infection. In support of these findings, TGF-\u03b2 was also recently shown in human T cells to promote the differentiation of certain Tfh properties in vitro (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schmitt et al., 2014b</a>). T cell-directed TGF-\u03b2 restricted the expression of the high affinity IL-2R\u03b1 chain CD25 on early effector CD4 T cells in vitro and in vivo, while, early anti-viral effector cells generated in the absence of TGF-\u03b2 signals displayed evidence of enhanced IL-2 signaling in vivo. Since IL-2 promotes Blimp1 expression and Th1 differentiation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pepper et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ballesteros-Tato et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Johnston et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nurieva et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Oestreich et al., 2012</a>), these data suggest that TGF-\u03b2 works to insulate early effector CD4 T cells from IL-2 signals and may play a central role in limiting Blimp1 expression in Tfh progenitor cells. Interestingly, TGF-\u03b2 signaling in B cells also promotes IgA class switching and mucosal immunity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cazac and Roes, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Borsutzky et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Seo et al., 2013</a>). Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the differentiation of both mucosal Tfh and B cells, which also must interact for proper antibody responses, this provides a unique example of a coordinated signaling pathway to maximize humoral immunity to respiratory influenza virus infection."

Furthermore, it is unclear whether other signals induced locally or globally during viral infections may contribute to Tfh cell differentiation. Herein, we identify TGF-\u03b2 as an additional signal that may restrict IL-2-induced Blimp1 and directly suppress T-bet expression to allow for Tfh cell differentiation. STAT3 signaling in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 is also a well-described inducer of Th17 effector cells. In fact, a subset of human Tfh cells share multiple properties with that of Th17 cells including co-expression of Bcl6 and Ror\u03b3t and the ability to provide B cell help (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schmitt et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2014b</a>). However, we did not detect Ror\u03b3t expression in murine anti-viral effector CD4 T cells (data not shown). Moreover, addition of TGF-\u03b2 to murine T cell cultures in the presence of IL-6 and IL-21 induced IL-17-producing T cells as expected, but actually suppressed Tfh properties including ICOS and IL-21 expression (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schmitt et al., 2014b</a>). These data suggest that although TGF-\u03b2 and STAT3 signals are required for murine Tfh differentiation during viral infection in vivo, they are not sufficient to induce this cell fate in vitro and that the specification of Tfh cells by these factors is under tight regulation in vivo. Since STAT4 signaling via IL-12 can promote early Tfh properties including Bcl6 expression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nakayamada et al., 2011</a>), it is possible that IL-12-STAT4 signaling is also required to induce a low level of T-bet in murine Tfh precursor cells to prevent Th17 development, but this will have to be formally evaluated."

Interestingly, rapamycin was recently reported to promote heterosubtypic immunity to influenza by reducing GC reactions and switched antibody responses, resulting in enhanced levels of protective influenza-specific IgM antibodies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Keating et al., 2013</a>). This study showed that the protective effects of rapamycin depended on both CD4 T and B cells, and that B cell-intrinsic mTORC1 activity was responsible for enhancing <i>Aicda</i> expression and class switching. Although the generation of Tfh cells was not examined in this prior study, our new findings would suggest that suppression of mTOR in the virus-specific CD4 T cells would likely suppress Th1 in favor of Tfh cell differentiation, possibly contributing to the protective effects of rapamycin on heterosubtypic immunity to influenza."

                        "text": "Intriguingly, Treg cells appear to play a central role in anti-viral effector CD4 T cell fate decisions during viral infections due to their production of TGF-\u03b2 and ability to consume IL-2. In support of this hypothesis, Treg cells were recently shown to be required for Tfh differentiation and GC reactions during influenza infection (<a href=\"#bib30\">Leon et al., 2014</a>). Although this group did not find a role for TGF-\u03b2 by treating mice with an anti-TGF-\u03b2 blocking antibody, we have demonstrated a requirement for direct TGF-\u03b2 using genetic ablation of the signaling receptor. Thus, Treg cells appear to play a central role in effector CD4 T cell fates during viral infection, likely by controlling the local bioavailability of both IL-2 and TGF-\u03b2. Another potential consideration is the differentiation of influenza-specific pTreg cells, which can temper pulmonary inflammation upon secondary or heterologous infections (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brincks et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kraft et al., 2013</a>). Future studies will determine whether influenza-specific pTreg, naturally occurring nTreg cells, or other cell types altogether, are a physiologically relevant source of TGF-\u03b2 to promote Tfh cell differentiation. Further, it is unclear at this time how TGF-\u03b2 may be interpreted differently by anti-viral Tfh cells and Treg cells, which can suppress CD25 in the former context, but not in the latter. It is likely that IL-2 itself is playing an important role in this setting by initiating a dominant positive feedback loop involving IL-2, STAT5, Blimp1, and FoxP3 to maintain the full Treg program in pTreg cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">de la Rosa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fontenot et al., 2005</a>) and that TGF-\u03b2 may only be required for the initial induction of FoxP3, but this remains to be addressed."

Ideally, a universal flu vaccine would elicit broadly protective circulating and lung-resident memory T cells as well as circulating IgM, IgG, and mucosal IgA antibodies that target conserved viral structures to maximize the potential for immunological cross-reactivity to drift variants and different viral subtypes. Since TGF-\u03b2 plays a critical role in mucosal tissues in the formation of tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mackay et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang and Bevan, 2013</a>), IgA-producing B cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cazac and Roes, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Borsutzky et al., 2004</a>), and as revealed here Tfh cells, it is an attractive target to consider in the development of a broadly protective universal influenza vaccine."

The most likely explanation is that it depends on the different combinations and doses of cytokines involved in specifying CD4 T cell fates. For example, it is known that T cell differentiation is highly sensitive to TGF-\u03b2 concentrations and that different types of T cells form according to the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 (e.g., Tregs vs T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, and Tfh cells) (Zhou, Nature 2008: Schmitt, Nat Immunol, 2014). Additionally, distinct signaling cascades downstream of TGF-\u03b2R (e.g., Smad vs. MAPK) may differ based on cell type or TGF-\u03b2 concentrations (Park, Mol. Immunol., 2007; Giroux, Blood, 2011; Gu, PNAS 2012, among others), which could impact the expression of TGF-\u03b2 target genes. Furthermore, the specific activity the commercially available recombinant TGF-\u03b2 is likely to differ considerably between vendors and/or lots, and therefore it is difficult to directly compare one study to another simply based on amount of TGF-\u03b2 used. Finally, rTGF-\u03b2 requires activation (cleavage) in a 10mM citric acid solution and the efficiency of activation can be variable from lot-to-lot, not to mention lab-to-lab. For instance, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 (10ng/ml) used in our studies was insufficient on its own to maintain FoxP3 protein expression in the absence of exogenous IL-2 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>), though it has been demonstrated to do so in other studies (Fantini, Nat Protocols, 2007)."

It is likely that CD25 expression on iTreg cells is sustained not by TGF-\u03b2, but by a dominant positive feed-back loop involving IL-2, STAT5, and Blimp1 (Fontenot et al., Nat Immunol, 2005). Therefore, cells that encounter relatively low amounts of TGF-\u03b2 in the absence of high amounts of IL-2 will likely not sustain CD25 expression and develop into iTregs (as observed in our hands, see <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>). We postulate that this would be an environment more conducive to T<sub>FH</sub> cell differentiation. It should also be noted that FoxP3 can be induced in activated Stg cells in vitro (as shown in the figure), but it is not expressed in LCMV or influenza-specific Stg cells in vivo. So it is not the TCR signal, per se, that prevents FoxP3 expression in these TCR Tg cells, but likely the combinatorial effects of viral antigen presentation and inflammatory cytokine milieu that is not amenable to induction of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Stg Treg cells in vivo. Thus, we do not have a conclusive answer to the reviewer\u2019s question, but we suspect that during LCMV infection, TGF-\u03b2 may not be produced at a level capable of inducing FoxP3<sup>+</sup> virus-specific Tregs, but is able to promote T<sub>FH</sub> cells.

However, in vitro, it is possible that TGF-\u03b2 was acting on APCs or other cells in the culture to regulate CD25 on the activated CD4 T cells; two situations that are also not mutually exclusive. To this end, we performed the experiment suggested by the reviewers and first purified the CD4 T cells prior to stimulation with anti-CD3+ anti-CD28<sup>+/-</sup> TGF-\u03b2 for 2-3 days. In agreement with our in vivo findings, this experiment showed that TGF-\u03b2 could suppress CD25 and IL-2 responsiveness (i.e., pSTAT5) over time (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 2</a>).

We designed the experiments using OT-II recipients to specifically ask whether T cell-directed TGF-\u03b2 was required for GC reactions and influenza-specific antibody, but we understand the desire to also assess the pathological outcomes of infection. We felt the experimental approach, while being suitable for comparing the ability of WT and Tgf-\u03b2RII KO CD4 T cells to help WT B cells, may present an unphysiological setting for comparing more general aspects of anti-influenza immunity, such as viral control. However, it is still worth examining if a general reduction overall in anti-influenza antibodies may affect the rates of viral clearance. Because our previous experiments went out to day 14 to measure influenza antibodies (and would likely be devoid of virus as influenza is typically cleared within 10 days), we repeated the experiment to examine viral titers at an earlier time point, day 6 p.i. At this relatively early time point, we found that the OT-II mice engrafted with WT T cells had lower amounts (\u223c10 fold) of influenza viral RNA in their lungs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 3</a>). As this experiment was only done once, we hesitate to make any strong conclusions, and quite honestly, we were surprised to see any effects at all at day 6 because this is relatively early to see the effects of a primary adaptive immune response on control of an influenza A infection (Kamperschroer, J Immunol, 2006; Mozdzanowska, J Immunol, 2000). Nonetheless, this result supports the model that the Tgf-\u03b2RII KO cells are less efficient at eliciting anti-viral Ab responses and this correlates with delayed viral control."

It is clear based on our data that T cell-directed TGF-\u03b2 is a critical signal for optimal GC and antibody responses during influenza infection. And although the effect of TGF-\u03b2 deletion on T<sub>FH</sub> cell formation and function is profound, as noted by the reviewers in point 6 below, the functional defects may be even stronger than the phenotypic defects. Thus, we conclude that TGF-\u03b2 is a necessary component of Tfh cell function during influenza infection. Many of the attributes we use to detect Tfh cell formation (CXCR5, PD-1, Ly6C, PSGL1) were affected by deletion of Tgf-\u03b2RII, but they were not fully abrogated. Therefore, we agree that we should be more conservative in our description of the role of TGF-\u03b2 in T<sub>FH</sub> cell formation. In support of this, TGF-\u03b2 preferentially induced expression of CXCR5 and ICOS more than Bcl6 and IL-21 in human CD4 T cells (Schmitt et al., Nat Immunol, 2014), and suggests that TGF-\u03b2 may contribute to part, but not all, of the Tfh cell program. We have revised the text accordingly. To better understand how TGF-\u03b2 contributes to T<sub>FH</sub> cell development and function, we are preparing to compare the global gene expression profiles of the flu-specific WT and KO CD4 T cells via RNA-seq. This could help us identify which T<sub>FH</sub> signature genes are most affected by TGF-\u03b2 signaling."

Shane Crotty\u2019s lab has found that IL-6 is an important signal for Tfh precursors (Choi et al., J. Immunol., 2013), but is dispensable for full Tfh effector cells during LCMV infection (Poholek, J. Immunol, 2010). We hypothesize that a determining factor between LCMV and influenza infections lies within the context of the viral infection (mucosal vs. systemic), and that TGF-\u03b2 is more abundant in the lung and medLN and plays a more prominent role in mucosal immune responses, but we currently only have circumstantial evidence for this. Our future studies will examine this hypothesis more closely by comparing additional systemic and mucosal infections, as well as different mucosal tissues such as the gut."

As one can see in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, we indeed find fewer TGF-\u03b2RII KO STg cells found within PNA<sup>+</sup> GC. Because both the downregulation of PSGL1 (as well as CCR7) and the upregulation of CXCR5 are important for their migration and retention in the GC, we believe that the aberrant expression of these molecules may preclude them from getting into or staying in the GC to provide B cell help. Whether they traffic there but do not remain or are impaired in their homing is also an interesting question, but one that would be best addressed using intravital imaging which is an expertise not present in our lab."

When we first identified the TGF-\u03b2 gene signature in WT Tfh cells, we sought advice from Richard Flavell at Yale who created these mice and has worked with this strain extensively to seek technical guidance on this exact point. They informed us to always sort on CD44<sup>lo</sup> na\u00efve phenotype T cells, which we have done in all experiments. Furthermore, we crossed the TGF-\u03b2RII<sup>f/f</sup> mice to the Smarta TCR transgenic (Stg) mice, which will slow the rate of any autoimmunity by restricting the repertoire (Sanjabi et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 2010). Additionally, for the experiments involving the adoptive transfer of polyclonal CD4 T cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3 and 4</a>) we used the TGF-\u03b2RII<sup>f/f</sup> distal Lck-cre mice because it has been reported that while nearly all the conventional T cells (i.e., non-T<sub>reg</sub> cells) lack TGF-\u03b2RII in this model, a fraction of CD4 T cells do escape cre-mediated deletion and develop into Tregs with the TGF-\u03b2RII intact. As such, the TGF-\u03b2RII<sup>f/f</sup> distal Lck-cre mice have no signs of autoimmunity during the first 18 weeks of life (Zhang, Nat Immunol, 2012)."

It appears that TGF-\u03b2 signals regulate at least 2 facets of T cell homeostasis. First, TGF-\u03b2 promotes the selection of low affinity T cells in the thymus, and second, TGF-\u03b2 regulates peripheral survival of na\u00efve CD4 T cells as well as Treg and Th17 cells (Ouyang, Immunity, 2013; Ouyang, Immunity, 2010; Li, Immunity, 2006). Although we did not go to the same lengths to assess these attributes for TGF-\u03b2R<sup>f/f</sup> CD4-cre Stg cells, we did not observe a survival defect for TGF-\u03b2RII KO Stg cells in the spleen or lymph nodes of young adult mice. Therefore, it appears that the overexpression of the high affinity Stg TCR bypasses any need for TGF-\u03b2 signals for na\u00efve T cell selection and survival and we believe that our comparisons of WT and TGF-\u03b2R KO na\u00efve CD4 T cells are fair."
