All adaptational or gain control mechanisms face the challenge of obtaining a reliable estimate of the property of the input to be adapted to and obtaining this estimate sufficiently rapidly to be useful. Here, we explore how the primate retina balances the need to change gain rapidly and reliably when photons arrive rarely at individual rod photoreceptors. We find that the weakest backgrounds that decrease the gain of the retinal output signals are similar to those that increase human behavioral threshold, and identify a novel site of gain control in the retinal circuitry. Thus, surprisingly, the gain of retinal signals begins to decrease essentially as soon as background lights are detectable; under these conditions, gain control does not rely on a highly averaged estimate of the photon count, but instead signals from individual photon absorptions trigger changes in gain."

Sensory neurons face the challenge of encoding this huge range of inputs within their much more restricted response range. Thus, neurons in our eyes and ears must continually adjust their gain or sensitivity to match changes in the light and sound inputs. These gain control processes must operate rapidly to keep up with the ever-changing input signals, but must also operate accurately so as not to distort the inputs."

There are two main types of light-sensitive cells in the retina: rods and cones. Vision at night relies on the ability of the rods to detect single photons\u2014the smallest unit of light. In starlight, an individual rod will register photons only rarely, and most of the time, the majority of the rods will not register any photons. Neurons in the retinal circuits that read out the rod signals receive input from hundreds or thousands of rods, and those rod inputs are highly amplified to allow detection of the responses produced when a tiny fraction of the rods absorbs a photon. But this amplification is dangerous, as it could easily saturate retinal signals when light levels increase. Gain control mechanisms are needed to avoid such saturation."

They reveal that levels of background light that can only just be detected behaviorally trigger retinal gain controls; these gain controls operate when less than 1% of rods absorb a photon. Under these conditions, the physics of light itself will cause considerable variability in the stream of photons arriving at the retina, leading to high variability in the gain of retinal responses. Nonetheless, changes in gain occurred rapidly following changes in background, indicating that the underlying mechanisms spend little time averaging incident photons. Taken together, these findings will require revisiting our ideas about how adaptational mechanisms balance the competing demands of speed and reliability to help us see the world around us."

Maintaining sensitivity as inputs change requires adaptational mechanisms that adjust the gain or amplification of neural signals to match their limited dynamic range to the range of the input signals a cell receives. Such gain control mechanisms operate under challenging conditions as the inputs they encounter can vary rapidly in time and locally in the space of possible stimuli. For example, visual neurons can experience &gt;1000-fold changes in input a few times a second as the eyes move to explore a typical scene (<a href=\"#bib23\">Frazor and Geisler, 2006</a>). Standard cameras fail to capture the full structure of such scenes because they employ a single global gain control in the form of an exposure setting, which is often poorly matched to the brightest and dimmest regions of a scene. Sensory gain controls are clearly more sophisticated."

This is an example of the classic change detection problem: how many samples from a signal distribution are needed to determine whether or not the distribution has changed (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buracas et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Deneve, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wark et al., 2009</a>)? Gain control mechanisms operating near absolute visual threshold exemplify this problem. Human behavioral threshold begins to increase for backgrounds producing \u223c0.01 isomerized rhodopsin molecules per rod per second (R*/rod/s) (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib13\">Donner, 1992</a>). Under these conditions, the number of photons absorbed in a small time window fluctuates widely due to the Poisson statistics that govern photon absorption. In principle, increases in behavioral threshold could solely reflect this increased noise without gain changes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barlow, 1965</a>). However, several studies suggest that weak backgrounds decrease the gain of retinal signals (<a href=\"#bib13\">Donner, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brown and Rudd, 1998</a>). Retinal gain control mechanisms operating at these low light levels must work in the presence of the irreducible noise associated with random photon arrivals."

The total number of rods that convey the signal increases at each stage of this pathway (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This convergence, together with amplification of signals by cellular and synaptic mechanisms, permits fully dark-adapted ganglion cells to generate one or more spikes to flashes producing photon absorptions in only \u223c0.1% of the rods (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barlow et al., 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mastronarde, 1983</a>; P Ala-Laurila and F Rieke, unpublished).

But the greater convergence at downstream locations in the rod bipolar pathway could provide a more reliable signal to control gain. Hence, we explored how the gain of retinal signals is controlled in dim backgrounds, with three main goals: (1) to determine if the gain of retinal signals is altered by backgrounds near the onset of changes in human behavioral threshold, (2) to determine how the retinal circuit averages over space and time to detect changes in the photon flux, and (3) to identify novel sites of gain control in the rod bipolar pathway."

Thus, these cells are likely to contribute critically to vision at low light levels. On parasol cells also provide a sensitive measure of the output of the rod bipolar pathway. This pathway dominates rod-mediated signaling across ganglion cell types at low light levels, and hence should provide shared steps in processing of rod signals. Indeed, as described below, we find that the gain of retinal signals at low light levels is controlled at a site located within the rod bipolar pathway."

Second, gain began to decrease for backgrounds near 0.01 or 0.02 R*/rod/s\u2014close to the onset of changes in human behavioral threshold.

These changes in noise with background were much less than expected from Poisson fluctuations in photon absorption and no changes in gain. If Poisson fluctuations dominated noise and gain remained constant, the standard deviation of the current should increase as the square root of the background\u2014that is, with slope 0.5\u2014since the variance of a Poisson process is proportional to the mean. Noise changed much less with background than this prediction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,E</a>). The largest increases in noise occurred between darkness and backgrounds &lt;0.01 R*/rod/s. These changes are produced by a nonlinear processing step that reduces gain in the dark (see above; P Ala-Laurila and F Rieke, unpublished).

The threshold in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F</a> corresponds to the threshold of an ideal observer of the ganglion cell's output, assuming that signal and noise are independent and additive. Thus, the threshold defined here provides a point of comparison to human behavioral threshold vs intensity curves.

For example, in the 0.1 s following an increase in background from 0.02 to 0.08 R*/rod/s, &lt;1 in 100 rods absorbs a photon. Thus, the observed gain changes cannot be explained by a mechanism operating on a small collection of rods; for example, a mechanism operating in single rods would only be engaged in 1 out of 100 rods, and hence could reduce overall gain at most by 1%. The halving of gain produced by this step in background requires a mechanism that integrates over at least 50 rods even if a single absorbed photon reduces gain to 0 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In this section, we describe experiments that probed the spatial scale of the gain control mechanism by measuring the extent to which a decrease in gain in one region of space transferred to neighboring regions."

Threshold is increased only by backgrounds that produce a sufficient rate of photon absorption to exceed intrinsic noise. Human behavioral threshold begins to increase for backgrounds near 0.01 R*/rod/s, similar to the backgrounds (\u223c0.02 R*/rod/s) at which primate ganglion cell thresholds began to increase. Both of these are considerably higher than the rate at which spontaneous activation of rhodopsin generates photon-like noise events in primate rods (0.003\u20130.004 R*/rod/s) (GD Field and F Rieke, unpublished). They are, however, consistent with measures of the total noise (i.e., both discrete and continuous) generated by macaque rods (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 2000</a>)."

Several other previous experiments, however, suggest that gain is reduced in the Rose\u2013deVries range. First, behavioral brightness matching experiments, which should be sensitive to changes in neural gain but not noise, show a robust Rose\u2013deVries region (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brown and Rudd, 1998</a>). Second, the spike responses of toad ganglion cells exhibit an \u223c10-fold range of backgrounds over which the threshold required to reach a criterion spike rate increases in proportion to the square root of the background (<a href=\"#bib14\">Donner et al., 1990</a>).

Considering luminance alone, retinal ganglion cells encode stimuli over 10 log units of background, far exceeding the dynamic range of any single mechanism. In the rod pathway, there are at least three gain control mechanisms engaged across backgrounds, each matched to the rod convergence at the adapting location. Backgrounds producing approximately 10\u201320 R*/rod/s halve the gain of the phototransduction cascade in primate rods (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 2000</a>). Backgrounds producing \u223c0.4 R*/rod/s halve the gain of the rod bipolar to AII synapse by reducing the number of releasable vesicles (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dunn et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dunn and Rieke, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Oesch and Diamond, 2011</a>). And, as shown here, backgrounds \u223c0.08 R*/rod/s engage a mechanism located downstream of the rod bipolar\u2013AII synapse; the light levels at which this mechanism is engaged are consistent with backgrounds that are just detectable given the total noise generated by macaque rods (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 2000</a>). Impressively, these mechanisms act in concert to create a smooth dependence of gain on background in the ganglion cell (e.g., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), even extending to backgrounds at which signaling begins to switch from rods to cones and gain control mechanisms in the cone pathway become active (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dunn et al., 2007</a>). At least five separate gain control mechanisms that contribute to a single smooth function relating background to gain over &gt;5 log units on each axis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) suggest that this particular functional form for adaptation was a target of selective pressure in primate evolution."

They show by systematic experiments that retinal adaptation begins at the dimmest detectable backgrounds given the intrinsic noise of the rods. Adaptation occurs rapidly at the level of AII Amacrine cells when as few as 1 or 2 photons are absorbed within a collection of several hundred rods. They successfully compare their experiments to human psychophysical experiments: human behavioral threshold begins to increase for backgrounds near 0.01 R*/rod/s, similar to the backgrounds (\u223c0.02 R*/rod/s) at which macaque ganglion cell thresholds began to increase."

We also now anticipate in the text that the gain control mechanism we identify and characterize is indeed located at a shared location in the rod bipolar pathway.
