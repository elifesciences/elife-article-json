Therefore, the level of NFATc1, the master transcription factor of osteoclast, must be tightly controlled. Although the activation and amplification of NFATc1 have been extensively studied, how NFATc1 signaling is eventually resolved is unclear. Here, we uncover a novel and critical role of the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 in mediating an NFATc1 self-limiting regulatory loop to prevent excessive osteoclastogenesis. Nur77 deletion leads to low bone mass owing to augmented osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Mechanistically, NFATc1 induces Nur77 expression at late stage of osteoclast differentiation; in turn, Nur77 transcriptionally up-regulates E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, which triggers NFATc1 protein degradation. These findings not only identify Nur77 as a key player in osteoprotection and a new therapeutic target for bone diseases, but also elucidate a previously unrecognized NFATc1\u2192Nur77\u2192Cblb\u2014\u2022NFATc1 feedback mechanism that confers NFATc1 signaling autoresolution."

Therefore, the level of NFATc1, the master transcription factor of osteoclast, must be tightly controlled. Although the activation and amplification of NFATc1 have been extensively studied, how NFATc1 signaling is eventually resolved is unclear. Here, we uncover a novel and critical role of the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 in mediating an NFATc1 self-limiting regulatory loop to prevent excessive osteoclastogenesis. Nur77 deletion leads to low bone mass owing to augmented osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Mechanistically, NFATc1 induces Nur77 expression at late stage of osteoclast differentiation; in turn, Nur77 transcriptionally up-regulates E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, which triggers NFATc1 protein degradation. These findings not only identify Nur77 as a key player in osteoprotection and a new therapeutic target for bone diseases, but also elucidate a previously unrecognized NFATc1\u2192Nur77\u2192Cblb\u2014\u2022NFATc1 feedback mechanism that confers NFATc1 signaling autoresolution."

A better understanding of the processes that maintain a healthy balance of osteoblasts and osteoclasts could help scientists develop better treatments with fewer side effects. Scientists have already learned that a protein called NFATc1 turns on the production of osteoclasts. But no one knew how NFATc1 is turned off in healthy bone to prevent the excessive growth of osteoclasts and too much bone turnover."

These modified mice had more osteoclasts and thinner bones than normal mice. Further experiments used radiation to wipe out the bone marrow of normal mice, who then received bone marrow transplants from mice that lacked Nur77. After the transplant, the normal mice showed bone loss. When the experiment was reversed, and Nur77-lacking mice received bone marrow from normal mice, their bone loss was alleviated. This indicates that Nur77 acts in the bone marrow cells to control osteoclasts and skeletal health."

Instead, Nur77 increases the production of an enzyme that breaks down the NFATc1 protein. Unexpectedly, the experiments also found that NFATc1 turns on the expression of Nur77. This means that NFATc1 essentially regulates itself by increasing its own breakdown when NFATc1 levels increase. This helps to explain how osteoclast production is normally kept in check, and may suggest new strategies for treating bone diseases."

It needs to maintain an optimal density to carry out important support, movement, and protective functions in organisms. The density of bone is tightly regulated by the bone-forming osteoblasts and the bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Osteoblasts come from the mesenchymal precursor cells, whereas osteoclast precursors come from monocyte\u2013macrophage lineage cells. Upon RANKL signaling, osteoclast precursor cells fuse and become multi-nucleated giant cells that can degrade both the organic and inorganic tissues of the bone. Osteoclast dysregulation has been associated with several human skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer metastasis to the bone (<a href=\"#bib22\">Novack and Teitelbaum, 2008</a>). Drugs that can inhibit osteoclast differentiation, activity, or survival have been shown to be effective against these diseases (<a href=\"#bib9\">Drake et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Body et al., 2010</a>)."

Ectopic NFATc1 expression alone in osteoclast precursors is sufficient to produce mature osteoclasts, whereas NFATc1 deletion blocks the ability of the precursors to differentiate into osteoclasts (<a href=\"#bib28\">Takayanagi et al., 2002</a>). NFATc1 binds to its response elements containing a consensus sequence of GGAAA, and its target genes in osteoclasts include cathepsin K, CLC-7 chloride channel, vacuolar proton pump subunit Atp6v0d2, etc (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kuroda and Matsuo, 2012</a>). NFATc1 has been shown to auto-amplify during osteoclast differentiation, and this auto-amplification process has been suggested to be important for osteoclast lineage commitment (<a href=\"#bib1\">Asagiri et al., 2005</a>). However, so far very few studies have dealt with whether and how NFATc1 signaling is attenuated upon its initial activation. As a result, despite the crucial functions of NFATc1 in osteoclastogenesis, the mechanisms for how NFATc1 signaling is resolved to prevent excessive osteoclast differentiation are still incompletely understood."

Unlike other nuclear receptors whose functions are mainly modulated by their ligands, Nur77 is mostly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zhao and Bruemmer, 2010</a>). Nur77 can bind to NurRE or NBRE as monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib25\">Philips et al., 1997</a>). Nur77 has been implicated in a variety of physiological processes, including thymocyte negative selection, hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, chronic inflammation, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hsu et al., 2004</a>). Nonetheless, it is unknown whether Nur77 can directly regulate skeletal homeostasis or bone cell differentiation. In this study, we uncover a novel and important role of Nur77 in NFATc1 protein degradation during osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, thus revealing a previously unrecognized mechanism that is essential for the resolution of NFATc1 signaling in which NFATc1 exerts self-limitation via an NFATc1\u2192Nur77\u2192Cblb\u2014\u2022NFATc1 negative feedback loop."

A time course analysis showed that <i>Nr4a1</i> mRNA started to rise on day 2 during osteoclastogenesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The other two members of the NR4A family, <i>Nr4a2</i> and <i>Nr4a3</i>, were either not expressed or expressed at much lower levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To determine if there is any potential regulatory role of Nur77 in osteoclastogenesis, we compared osteoclast differentiation cultures from bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors of Nur77 knockout (Nur77 KO) mice and WT littermate controls. The results revealed an enhanced osteoclast differentiation in Nur77 KO cultures shown by the higher expression of osteoclast differentiation markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (<i>Trap</i>), cathepsin K (<i>Ctsk</i>), calcitonin receptor (<i>Calcr</i>), carbonic anhydrase 2 (<i>Car2</i>), as well as the master osteoclastogenic transcription factor <i>Nfatc1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Consistent with these results, we have also observed more and larger mature osteoclasts in the differentiation cultures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), as well as higher resorptive activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes was comparable, indicating an unaffected osteoclast apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In contrast, osteoblast differentiation from Nur77 KO bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors was unaltered, shown by the similar induction of osteoblast markers such as collagen, type I, alpha 1 (<i>Col1a1</i>), and <i>Osteocalcin</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These results suggest that Nur77 may specifically suppress osteoclastogenesis during bone remodeling."

Two complimentary sets of bone marrow transplantation were performed, and serum bone markers were assessed two months later. In the first set, we harvested donor bone marrow cells from both WT and Nur77 KO mice, and transplanted them to irradiated WT recipient mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

We first compared osteoblast differentiation cultures derived from Nur77 KO or WT control mice and found that there was no difference in the expression of <i>Rankl</i> or <i>Opg</i>, resulting in a comparable <i>Rankl</i>/<i>Opg</i> ratio (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>).

Hence, we compared <i>Rankl</i> and <i>Opg</i> expression in femur shafts that contain mainly osteocytes. Our results showed that there was no difference in <i>Rankl</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>); however, Nur77 KO osteocytes express a markedly higher level of <i>Opg</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), leading to a significantly lower <i>Rankl</i>/<i>Opg</i> ratio (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). The lower <i>Rankl</i>/<i>Opg</i> ratio in the Nur77 KO mice is unlikely to be the cause of the augmented osteoclastogenesis, but presumably an attempt of osteocytes to suppress the osteoclast over-activation. These results, coupled with unaltered in vitro osteoblast differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and in vivo bone formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Q,S</a>), suggest that osteoblast/osteocyte are not major contributors to the excessive osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in Nur77 KO mice."

RANKL binding to RANK receptor on osteoclast precursor cells activates AP1 transcription factor via c-Jun phosphorylation, as well as NF\u03baB transcription factor via I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, which in turn induces and initiates the autoamplification of NFATc1, the master transcriptional switch of osteoclastogenesis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kuroda and Matsuo, 2012</a>). Although <i>Nfatc1</i> mRNA level was 2-fold higher in Nur77 KO osteoclast differentiation cultures on day 3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), we found that NFATc1 protein level was sevenfold higher in Nur77 KO cultures compared to WT control cultures on day 3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). It has been reported that NFATc1 protein is degraded on day 3\u20134 during osteoclast differentiation, despite the continuously rising <i>Nfatc1</i> mRNA levels (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, our time course analysis showed that in WT cultures, NFATc1 protein was elevated on day 2 but then rapidly down-regulated on day 3 and day 4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, in Nur77 KO cultures, the initial increase of NFATc1 protein was sustained and NFATc1 protein remained high on day 3 and day 4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We then compared c-Jun phosphorylation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in the osteoclast differentiation cultures upon RANKL stimulation, but did not observe any significant difference between Nur77 KO and WT control cultures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which is in agreement to the similar NFATc1 protein induction on day 1 and day 2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Moreover, there is no Nur77 binding sequence in a 4-Kb region of NFATc1 promoter. These results indicate that Nur77 regulation of NFATc1 protein level resides downstream of transcription."

Consistent with the lower Nur77 protein abundance, Nur77 over-expression also dosage-dependently reduced the NFATc1 transcriptional output from a luciferase reporter driven by NFATc1 response elements (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This Nur77 reduction of NFATc1 activity was completely abolished by MG132 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), indicating that it was mediated by ubiquitin degradation pathway. The mRNA expression of <i>Nr4a1</i> and <i>Nfatc1</i> in osteoclasts is comparable on day 2\u20133 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), supporting that Nur77 regulation of NFATc1 is relevant in the osteoclast. These findings further support the notion that Nur77 promotes NFATc1 protein degradation."

We next searched for E3 ligases that could be responsible for NFATc1 degradation in osteoclasts. It has been reported that Cbl-b, an E3 ligase in the Cbl family, is a major contributor to the ubiquitin-mediated down-regulation of NFATc1 at late stage of osteoclast differentiation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that Nur77 may promote NFATc1 degradation by inducing Cbl-b. We found that <i>Cblb</i> expression was significantly lower in Nur77 KO osteoclast differentiation cultures compared to WT control cultures on day 2 and day 4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Conversely, Nur77 over-expression in HEK293 cells significantly increased <i>Cblb</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Importantly, a truncated Nur77 mutant in which the DNA binding domain (DBD) was deleted could no longer up-regulate <i>Cblb</i>, suggesting that Nur77 induction of <i>Cblb</i> transcription depends on its DNA binding ability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The functional connection between Nur77 and Cbl-b is further supported by the similar bone phenotype in Nur77 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and Cblb KO mice (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nakajima et al., 2009</a>), including increased <i>ex vivo</i> osteoclast differentiation and in vivo bone resorption, but unaltered bone formation, leading to lower bone mass."

Thus, we subsequently examined the intrinsic ability of Nur77 to regulate NFATc1 via transfection in a heterologous cell type such as HEK293 cells, in the absence of the other RANKL signaling in osteoclast cultures. We show that Nur77 can decrease NFATc1 protein levels without affecting <i>Nfatc1</i> mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Also, there is no Nur77 binding sequence in NFATc1 promoter, further support that Nur77 does not directly regulate NFATc1 transcription.

This supports that Cbl-b, but not Cbl, is a physiologically significant regulator of osteoclast in vivo. (2) Nur77 over-expression induces the expression of Cbl-b, but not Cbl. (3) A complete NurRE exists only in Cbl-b promoter, but not in Cbl promoter. (4) Nur77 KO osteoclast cultures show a significant lower level of Cbl-b, but not Cbl. (5) Finally, our in vivo genetic data comparing Nur77 Cblb DKO mice with Cblb KO mice show that Cbl-b deletion completely abolishes the enhanced osteoclast differentiation, elevated bone resorption, and reduced bone mass in Nur77 KO mice, demonstrating that Cbl-b is the major and essential mediator of Nur77 regulation of osteoclastogenesis, which is not compensated by Cbl."

                        "text": "In the process of studying the role of Nur77 in NFATc1 regulation and osteoclast differentiation, we inadvertently discovered that Nur77 is not only a regulator of NFATc1 but also a transcriptional target of NFATc1, thus revealing a negative feedback loop where NFATc1 induces its own degradation by up-regulating Nur77 and Cbl-b. This mechanism is crucial for proper cellular differentiation and function, since the resolution of signaling is just as important as its initiation and amplification. A breach in the NFATc1\u2192Nur77\u2192Cblb\u2014\u2022NFATc1 regulatory loop, exemplified by the Nur77 KO mice, will cause pathologically elevated NFATc1 levels during late stage of osteoclastogenesis and send osteoclasts into overdrive. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to propose an NFATc1 self-limiting regulatory mechanism. Therefore, NFATc1 exerts three functions to control osteoclastogenesis. In addition to the previously recognized roles in its auto-amplification and activating osteoclast genes to initiate the differentiation, NFATc1 also plays a role in its auto-resolution to cease the differentiation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Our findings will pave the road for future investigations to examine whether this NFATc1\u2192Nur77\u2192Cblb\u2014\u2022NFATc1 negative feedback loop may be widely applicable to NFATc1 regulation of other cellular processes such as T cell activation and cancer development."

Current clinically approved osteoclast inhibitors, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab (anti-RANKL antibody), may cause severe side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Khan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boquete-Castro et al., 2015</a>). These side effects could stem from a variety of factors including target specificity. The whole body Nur77 KO mice, however, provides an example where despite the wide spread expression of a gene, it still can be targeted due to the differential sensitivity in different tissues. Although Nur77 has been implicated in numerous physiological functions in vitro, most of these functions did not hold true in vivo based on a general lack of phenotype in Nur77 KO mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lee et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chao et al., 2013</a>). Until recently, Nur77 KO mice largely appear healthy and normal, and only exhibit clinical deficiencies under severe stress (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Palumbo-Zerr et al., 2015</a>) or with the deletion of an additional NR4A gene (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mullican et al., 2007</a>). This may be partially due to functional redundancy among NR4A family members so that the compensation by Nurr1 and Nor1 masks the effects of Nur77 loss. Interestingly, we found that Nur77 is the predominant NR4A member in the osteoclast lineage with little or no Nurr1 or Nor1 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), explaining the critical role of Nur77 in osteoclastogenesis so that the effects on bone is evident by Nur77 deletion alone. This creates an exciting opportunity for selective drug targeting and precision medicine with minimal side effects. Most recently, Tontonoz et al. have uncovered a muscle protective role of Nur77 as mice deficient in Nur77 alone exhibit reduced muscle mass and myofiber size (<a href=\"#bib29\">Tontonoz et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, Nur77 activation may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for musculoskeletal degenerative diseases with dual benefits on muscle and bone."

Indeed, defects in the components of ubiquitin and proteasome system have been implicated in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (<a href=\"#bib26\">Popovic et al., 2014</a>). Bortezomib, a peptide inhibitor of proteasome, has been approved for clinical usage in pathological settings such as refractory multiple myeloma (<a href=\"#bib27\">Richardson et al., 2005</a>). The discovery of pathway-specific ubiquitin\u2013proteasome activators, however, is somewhat lagging behind. Nonetheless, oleuropein, a small molecule proteasome activator, has been shown to delay replicative senescence of human embryonic fibroblast (<a href=\"#bib13\">Katsiki et al., 2007</a>). In addition, oleuropein treatment has been shown to inhibit osteoclast formation and suppress the loss of trabecular bone in ovariectomized mice (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hagiwara et al., 2011</a>), giving hope that small molecules that selectively activate the protein degradation pathway may be a promising future therapeutic strategy for skeletal and other diseases."
