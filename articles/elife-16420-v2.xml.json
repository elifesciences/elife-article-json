However, several questions concerning the neural representation of cross-modal stimuli remain open. Indeed, it is poorly understood if cross-modal stimuli evoke unique or overlapping representations in a primary sensory cortex and whether learning can modulate these representations. Here we recorded single unit responses to auditory, visual, somatosensory, and olfactory stimuli in the gustatory cortex (GC) of alert rats before and after associative learning. We found that, in untrained rats, the majority of GC neurons were modulated by a single modality. Upon learning, both prevalence of cross-modal responsive neurons and their breadth of tuning increased, leading to a greater overlap of representations. Altogether, our results show that the gustatory cortex represents cross-modal stimuli according to their sensory identity, and that learning changes the overlap of cross-modal representations."

In addition, of the four stimuli, the rats most easily learned to associate odors and touch with a sugary solution. This is consistent with the fact that rodents rely more upon their whiskers and their sense of smell to find food they do their eyes and ears. Finally, learning to associate a stimulus other than taste with a sugary solution increased the number of neurons in the gustatory cortex that subsequently responded to other senses and changed their response properties."

Neurons in the visual cortex respond to acoustic stimuli (<a href=\"#bib31\">Iurilli et al., 2012</a>) and activity in the auditory cortex is also shaped by visual (<a href=\"#bib4\">Calvert et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brosch et al., 2005</a>) and somatosensory stimulation (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhou and Fuster, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schroeder et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brosch et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lakatos et al., 2007</a>).

As a result, it is not known whether cross-modal stimuli pertaining to distinct sensory modalities converge on the same set of sensory cortical neurons or whether they recruit different groups of neurons. The former possibility is compatible with cross-modal responses reflecting a general, modality-independent arousal or distracting signal (<a href=\"#bib67\">Talsma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Iurilli et al., 2012</a>) and suggests the existence of broadly tuned, multi-modal neurons capable of being activated by any cross-modal stimulus. The latter possibility proposes that primary sensory areas can represent the sensory modality of cross-modal stimuli and predicts the presence of stimulus-specific unimodal representations."

We presented stimuli belonging to four sensory modalities: auditory, visual, somatosensory, or olfactory. Cross-modal stimuli were presented to two, distinct groups of animals: a group not trained to associate cross-modal stimuli with sucrose (or any other taste) and another in which rats were trained to associate cross-modal stimuli with sucrose. The first cohort of rats served to determine if GC could respond to the cross-modal stimuli used and to characterize their baseline representations. The second cohort allowed us to determine if and how associative learning modified baseline cross-modal representations. Single unit recordings in alert, untrained rats revealed that GC neurons could represent the identity of cross-modal stimuli via largely non-overlapping representations and show a strong bias toward olfactory and somatosensory stimuli. Olfactory and somatosensory stimuli also led to faster associative learning compared to visual and auditory stimuli. Comparisons between neural responses in untrained and trained rats demonstrated that, upon learning, GC maintained the ability to discriminate different sensory modalities, while also developing associative responses. Association with a common gustatory outcome increased the prevalence of neurons responding to cues, widened the overlap between neural representations and enhanced the similarity between responses to cues with similar associability."

Sucrose, NaCl, citric acid and quinine were also delivered to test each neuron\u2019s response to taste. (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; see Materials and methods). Gustatory stimuli were delivered intraorally via a manifold inserted into an intra-oral cannula. Intraoral delivery was chosen for complete control of stimulus delivery and for consistency with previous studies on expectation in GC (<a href=\"#bib57\">Samuelsen et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gardner and Fontanini, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu and Fontanini, 2015</a>).

Briefly, for each neuron, we computed the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of spike occurrences across all trials within a temporal window starting 1 s before stimulus onset (i.e., baseline) and ending 2 s (for cross modal stimuli) or 2.5 s (for gustatory stimuli) after stimulus presentation. Sudden changes in firing rates resulted in a change in the CDF slope and in the identification of a 'change point' (CP). A binomial test (p&lt;0.05) was used to compare spike counts before and after each CP to evaluate their statistical significance (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gallistel et al., 2004</a>).

In addition, a consistent proportion of neurons were modulated by other sensory modalities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; 33.3% [45/135] of recorded neurons responded to at least one non-gustatory stimulus; odor: 16.2% [22/135]; air puff: 15.5% [21/135]; tone: 4.4% [6/135]; light: 3.7% [5/135]). Orofacial movements evoked by non-taste stimuli were hardly detectable and significantly smaller compared to the ones evoked by tastants, indicating that they were not driving the changes in neuronal activity we observed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; Wilcoxon sign rank test: p&lt;0.05). The absence of a relationship between responses to cross-modal stimuli and mouth movements can also be visualized for the two representative neurons depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013G</a>. Among the non-gustatory stimuli, odors and somatosensory stimuli appeared to be the most effective in modulating GC neurons. When comparing the prevalence of cross-modal responses for the different stimuli, we observed significant differences in the proportion of neurons that responded to cross-modal stimuli (Pearson\u2019s <b>\u03c7</b><sup>2</sup> test; <b>\u03c7</b><sup>2</sup><sub>(3)</sub> = 17.35, p&lt;0.001). Specifically, while the proportion of neurons responding to odorant and air puff were similar (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; Marascuillo\u2019s test, p&gt;0.05), both were significantly higher compared to the proportion of neurons responding to sound and light (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; Marascuillo\u2019s test, p&gt;0.05). We then investigated the convergence of stimuli of different sensory modalities onto single GC neurons. We first identified, within the group of neurons whose firing rates were modulated by at least one taste delivery, those that were taste selective. A neuron was deemed to be taste selective if it showed significantly different responses to the four gustatory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jezzini et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Samuelsen et al., 2013</a>). Within the group of taste selective neurons (87/135), the majority responded exclusively to gustatory stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, D\u2013E</a>; 70.1%, [61/87]), with only a few also activated by one (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, F\u2013G</a>; 25.3%, [22/87]) or two (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; 4.6%, [4/87]) cross modal stimuli. The percentage of neurons being both taste selective and responsive to cross-modal stimuli was not significantly different from what expected if the probabilities of the two conditions were independent (bootstrap procedure, p&gt;0.05). We then turned our attention to the group of neurons responsive to cross-modal stimuli (45/135) and analyzed the convergence of non-gustatory responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The majority of cross-modal neurons were activated exclusively by one of the non-taste stimuli (either air puff, odor, tone or light stimuli; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>; 84.4%, [38/45]) and only a few neurons responded to two (11.1%, [5/45]) or three (4.4%, [2/45]) cross-modal stimuli. These percentages were not significantly different from those expected by chance given the fractions of neurons responding to different cues (bootstrap procedure, p&gt;0.05 for all cases)."

A second group of rats (trained, n = 5) was conditioned to associate each of the four cross-modal, 'non-gustatory' sensory cues with the intraoral delivery of sucrose (the unconditioned stimulus). In every daily session (for a total of 14 days), rats experienced twenty trials of cue-sucrose pairings for each modality (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; see Materials and methods). For each trial, the sensory modality of the cue presented was chosen in a pseudo-random manner. In order to track associative learning we monitored orofacial movements in response to conditioned stimuli (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). A significant increase of mouth movements during the cue compared to baseline indicated the appearance of a conditioned response and allowed us to establish learning (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> <i>leftmost panels</i>). Analysis of orofacial movements revealed that after 14 days of training rats learned to associate each anticipatory cue with the delivery of sucrose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The conditioned orofacial movements were significantly stronger on the last day of training compared to the first day (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; somatosensory: two-way ANOVA [factors: days and temporal epochs], F<sub>(1,2)</sub> = 43.8, p&lt;0.01; odor: two-way ANOVA, F<sub>(1,2)</sub> = 45.3, p&lt;0.01; tone: two-way ANOVA, F<sub>(1,2)</sub> = 47.7, p&lt;0.01; light: two-way ANOVA, F<sub>(1,2)</sub> = 76.6, p&lt;0.01). <i>Post-hoc</i> analyses revealed that, for each sensory modality, the difference in mouth movements across days was specific to the cue presentation epoch (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; 'cue': p&lt;0.01 for days effect with Tukey\u2019s correction).

Additional analyses were performed to determine if the distribution of neurons responsive to cross-modal stimuli depended on the number of sessions spent at the\u00a0final performance level. To address this issue we computed the fraction of neurons responsive to cross-modal stimuli for sessions recorded on the\u00a0same number of days (i.e., 12, 13 and 14 days) after reaching final performance level (i.e., days 15, 16, 17 for odor and air puff and days 19, 20, 21 for tone and light). As <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> shows, the bias toward olfactory and somatosensory stimuli persisted within this matched sample of sessions. In addition, a second analysis was performed to determine directly if the number of cue responsive neurons increased over the course of subsequent sessions (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). No increase and no difference in the number of cross-modal responsive neurons were observed with increasing the number of sessions at final performance level.

We performed a series of analyses to investigate the time-course of cross-modal cue responses. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> shows the\u00a0normalized firing rate (auROC) responses for all the neurons that were modulated by at least one anticipatory cue in trained and untrained rats. Visual inspection of these plots suggests that associative learning may be associated with an increase in the number of GC neurons that are inhibited by the cues, and may lead to more time-varying neural responses. We quantified the number of neurons that were either excited or inhibited (only the first change in firing compared to baseline is considered here) by the cue in untrained and trained rats. In the group of trained animals we observed a reduction in the proportion of neurons that were excited by the cue (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>; 70.3% [38/54] for untrained <i>vs.</i> 52.2% [59/113] for trained, test for equality of proportion;<b>\u03c7</b><sup>2</sup><sub>(1)</sub> = 4.30, p&lt;0.05) and an increase in the proportion of neurons that were inhibited by the cue (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>; rightmost panel; 29.6% [16/54] for untrained <i>vs.</i> 47.7% [54/113] for trained, test for equality of proportion;<b>\u03c7</b><sup>2</sup><sub>(1)</sub> = 4.94, p&lt;0.05). To determine whether learning was associated with responses with more frequent firing rate changes, we computed the average number of firing rate modulations for each response.

For each cross-modal stimulus, the proportion of correct hits and errors was computed. Correct hits were trials in which a stimulus was correctly classified as belonging to a specific modality (for example, an air puff being classified as a somatosensory stimulus and not as an odor, tone or light; referred hereafter as correct hits). Errors were trials in which a stimulus was misclassified (for example, an air puff being incorrectly classified as an odor, tone or light). In the case of errors, we focused on the most frequent misclassifications (for example, an air puff being more frequently misclassified as an odor compared to tone or light; referred hereafter as false hits). Percentages of correct and false hits over the total number of trials for each cross-modal stimulus were computed for two temporal windows: shortly after the onset of the cross-modal stimulus (from 0 to 200 ms) and shortly after stimulus offset (from 2.5 to 2.7 s). For untrained animals, neural activity led to qualitatively similar classification performance in both windows. After onset and after offset of cross-modal stimuli, the average of correct hits significantly outnumbered the average of false hits (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; stimulus onset: 0.67 \u00b1 0.16 and 0.26 \u00b1 0.16 correct and false hits respectively; t-test: t<sub>(6)</sub> = 3.54; p&lt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>; stimulus offset: 0.48 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.25 \u00b1 0.04 correct and false hits respectively; t-test: t<sub>(6)</sub> = 5.31; p&lt;0.05). For trained animals, performance in the two windows was qualitatively different. After cue onset, activity allowed for optimal coding of stimulus identity, with correct hits dramatically outnumbering false hits (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>; 0.70 \u00b1 0.17 and 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 correct and false hits respectively; t-test: t<sub>(6)</sub> = 5.89; p&lt;0.05). After the offset of the cue, i.e., in the delay interval (500 ms) preceding sucrose delivery, neural activity lead to an equally large number of correct and false hits (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>; 0.45 \u00b1 0.09 and 0.38 \u00b1 0.04 correct and false hits respectively; t-test: t<sub>(6)</sub> = 1.11; p=0.30). It is important to notice that cross-modal stimuli were not randomly misclassified. Indeed the decoder was more likely to confound stimuli that shared similar associability. During the delay period, olfactory and somatosensory cues (the strongly associable cues, as determined by the faster learning rate in the behavioral experiment) could be easily confused with each other; similarly, visual and auditory cues (the two stimuli with weaker associability) could be misclassified. Misclassifications between cues with different associability were significantly less frequent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>)."

Positive values of this index indicate that a neuron is modulated similarly by cues with similar taste-associability power (odor and somatosensory stimuli or tone and light), while negative values indicate the opposite (no similarity between responses to stimuli with similar associability). Comparison of the CIs computed for untrained and trained rats show differences in the time-course between the two conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013H</a>). While before association GC neurons show no above chance peak in the CI throughout the entire time-course (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>), after learning GC neurons showed a significant peak in CI right after cue onset and a stronger and sustained peak starting 1.7 s after cue onset and lasting for the duration of the delay (500 ms between cue offset and sucrose presentation) period (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>)."

In the case of GC, cross-modal responses are changes in firing rates evoked by auditory, visual, olfactory and somatosensory stimuli. While this definition does not distinguish between responses purely representing the sensory features (i.e., the modality) of the different stimuli and responses purely representing learned associations, our data provide evidences that both types of representations can exist in a primary sensory cortex."

We found that neurons in GC represent stimuli of all four modalities, but have a strong bias in favor of somatosensory and olfactory stimuli. Analysis of the convergence of different modalities onto the same neuron revealed that in untrained animals GC neurons are largely unimodal. This result implies that, in the\u00a0absence of taste-association, representations of cross-modal stimuli in GC are non-overlapping. Cross-modal responses were mostly excitatory and tended to be tonic, lasting for the entire duration of the stimulation window and beyond.

Training showed that different modalities lead to different learning rates, with olfactory and somatosensory stimuli (e.g., those more represented in GC neurons of untrained animals) becoming associated with sucrose more rapidly than auditory and visual stimuli. Analysis of neural responses after training revealed that associative learning was linked to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of neurons responding to non-gustatory stimuli compared to untrained animals. This increase led to an expansion of the contingent of neurons that responded to multiple stimuli. While in untrained animals only a few taste selective neurons responded to cross-modal stimuli, after associative learning the majority of taste selective neurons were also cue responsive. Similarly, as a result of the expansion of cross-modal representations, the number of neurons responding to more than one cue increased after associative learning. Analysis of taste responses in cue responsive neurons revealed no bias toward any specific tastant, demonstrating that cue-sucrose pairing did not result in a preferential representation of sucrose. Indeed, cue responsive neurons maintained the ability to represent multiple tastants.Quantification of the breadth of tuning revealed that learning reduced stimulus selectivity and increased the breadth of tuning in GC neurons. Learning also increased the number of neurons that were inhibited by cross-modal stimuli and changed the dynamics of the responses. Instead of being tonic and monophasic as in untrained animals, cross-modal responses in trained rats showed multiple modulations lasting for the entire duration of the cue and beyond. In addition, decoding analysis revealed that cue responses after learning retain information about the sensory modality of the cue; in addition, they acquire information regarding the associability of different modalities."

                                "text": "Several studies have explored responses to cross-modal stimuli in GC of anesthetized (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yamamoto et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rodgers et al., 2008</a>) or alert, untrained animals (<a href=\"#bib80\">Yamamoto et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Katz et al., 2001</a>). Recently it was shown that learning the taste-predictive value of an auditory cue increases the prevalence of auditory responses in GC (<a href=\"#bib57\">Samuelsen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gardner and Fontanini, 2014</a>). So far, however, no study has assessed GC responses to cross-modal stimuli in both untrained and trained animals. Our experiments show that GC can encode stimuli of all sensory modalities, even stimuli that have relatively little ethological relationship to taste, like sounds or flashes of light. In untrained animals, each sensory modality engages a selective group of unimodal neurons, endowing GC with the ability to discriminate different stimuli. This result indicates that cross-modal responses in GC are not just reflecting the general processing of non-gustatory information. If cross-modal responses simply encoded the presence of generally arousing (<a href=\"#bib67\">Talsma et al., 2010</a>), rewarding (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shuler and Bear, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Pooresmaeili et al., 2014</a>) or distracting (<a href=\"#bib31\">Iurilli et al., 2012</a>) stimuli, they would involve overlapping sets of neurons for each stimulus. The presence of cross-modal responses in untrained animals may reflect GC\u2019s intrinsic tuning toward multisensoriality and its ability to encode different dimensions linked to food expectation. These responses can also represent a substrate upon which learning can operate (<a href=\"#bib71\">Vogels et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, pairing stimuli with sucrose leads to an expansion of cross-modal representations and the development of cue responses. Responses become temporally more complex relative to those observed in untrained animals, probably due to GC inputs from multiple regions (<a href=\"#bib57\">Samuelsen et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu and Fontanini, 2015</a>). After learning, fewer neurons are unimodal and more become multimodal, suggesting that GC is now also encoding for a common property of the cross-modal stimuli, e.g., their taste-anticipatory value. In addition to encoding expectation, decoding analysis indicates that, after associative learning, GC can encode both the identity of different cross-modal stimuli, and their associability. These results confirm and significantly expand data from the literature on the functional role of GC (<a href=\"#bib57\">Samuelsen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gardner and Fontanini, 2014</a>)."

We cannot exclude that both neural and behavioral biases might reflect differences in detectability or saliency across stimuli sensory modalities before training. Indeed, it is possible that, before learning, the air puff and the odor may be more intense than light and tone. In this regard, it would be interesting for future studies to explore various stimulus intensities and establish the intensity-response relationship of cross-modal responses. We would not be surprised if varying the intensity of stimuli affected the number of neurons recruited, however, we believe that the bias for odors and somatosensory stimuli would still persist. This belief is supported by the strong interconnectivity between GC with olfactory (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shipley and Geinisman, 1984</a>) and somatosensory areas (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guldin and Markowitsch, 1983</a>)."

After 14 days of training, behavioral responses for all the cues become similar, indicating that the four cues acquire similar saliency. Despite the absence of a behavioral bias, the neural bias was maintained, suggesting that it cannot be fully accounted by differences in behavioral saliency among stimuli. One possible explanation for the persistence of the bias after learning may involve the non-uniform number of sessions at final performance level for the different cues. Indeed, rapid learning for somatosensory and olfactory cues resulted in a larger number of above-criterion sessions compared to visual and auditory cues. To investigate this possibility, we matched the number of sessions at final performance level across cues and quantified the fraction of neurons responsive to the four cross-modal stimuli. The bias still persisted after matching the number of sessions, demonstrating that it is inherent to GC and does not depend on the amount of cue-sucrose exposure."

As a result, our understanding of the convergence of information from multiple modalities on individual sensory cortical neurons is limited. Our data address this important issue directly and show that in alert, untrained rats, GC can respond to stimuli of all five sensory modalities, and that the majority of neurons respond to a single modality. The degree of convergence of cross-modal information on single neurons, however, is not fixed; indeed our data demonstrate that it can be modified by associative learning."

It is worth mentioning that, the set of cross-modal stimuli used in this study is not homogeneous. Some stimuli, those with stronger associability, recruit many more GC neurons than others. Nevertheless, learning is capable of expanding the representations for all the stimuli, regardless of how much they activate GC at baseline.

On the basis of that result, we can speculate that the presence of aversive outcomes might drive the expansion of cross-modal representations as much as rewards. In addition, the presence of different outcomes might be important in inducing the development of cue responses showing a bias for specific tastants. As for extinction, findings from the same study (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gardner and Fontanini, 2014</a>) suggest that it might shrink cross-modal representations. It is worth mentioning that the results in (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gardner and Fontanini, 2014</a>) also showed that neurons in GC could change their firing rates in trials in which sucrose was predicted by a cross-modal cue but omitted. This phenomenon, which was not further investigated in the present paper, demonstrates that cross-modal activity in GC may also reflect learned expectations of reward timing \u2013 a phenomenon well studied in the primary visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shuler and Bear, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2015</a>).

Cross-modal stimuli were presented in a pseudorandom fashion; they always lasted 2 s and their onset preceded the delivery of sucrose by 2.5 s. Trials occurred at a 50 \u00b1 10 s interval (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The entire conditioning period lasted 14 days (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; one session per day). In each daily session, rats received 20 trials of each cue-taste pair. The time-course of classical conditioning was monitored every day by quantifying conditioned mouth movements (see Mouth movement analysissection). After 14 days of training, rats entered the recording phase. In this phase, we recorded spiking activity and orofacial movements evoked by random delivery of the following cross-modal and gustatory stimuli: an odor, a puff of air on the distal portion of the rats\u2019 whiskers (<i>air puff</i>), a light, a tone, expected and unexpected sucrose, unexpected NaCl, unexpected citric acid and unexpected quinine (see Stimuli delivery section below for further information). In this experiment, as during the conditioning phase (see above), each cross-modal cue anticipates by 2.5 s the delivery of sucrose (expected sucrose), whereas unexpected sucrose and the other three tastants are delivered without cross-modal stimuli preceding them (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). 25 \u00b1 5 s after each stimulus delivery ~50 \u00b5l of water (<i>Rinse</i>) was delivered. 25 \u00b1 5 s after a rinse a new trial began (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The ITI was 50 \u00b1 10 s. Between 8 and 14 trials for each stimulus were delivered. Recordings were performed for 14 days (one session per day); at the end of each daily session bundles of electrodes were lowered 150 \u00b5m."

A pressurized taste delivery system delivered tastants through the IOCs in aliquots of 40 \u00b5l with a 25\u201330 ms pulse (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gardner and Fontanini, 2014</a>). A rinse of water (50 \u00b5l) followed the taste after 25 \u00b1 5 s in order to wash the oral cavity. The concentrations of the four basic tastants used were 0.1\u00a0M for sucrose, citric acid and NaCl, while a concentration of 0.001\u00a0M was used for quinine-HCl. All the tastants were from Sigma-Aldrich. The auditory cue consisted of a 75 dB, 2 kHz single tone. Two green LEDs with a peak emission wavelength of 575 nm delivered the visual cue. The intensity of the light was 0.147 lm. The LEDs were placed bilaterally at a distance of ~5 cm from each eye. The somatosensory cue consisted of a bilateral air puff generated by a pico-spritzer (~5 psi) delivered from two PFA tubes (5 mm diameter). The outlet of the tube was placed ~5 cm from the rats\u2019 whiskers. The air puff was directed to the distal portion of the whiskers. The olfactory cue (0.1% Isoamyl acetate) was delivered via a custom-built, computer-controlled olfactometer (<a href=\"#bib70\">Verhagen et al., 2007</a>), and delivered at a ~2 cm distance from the rats\u2019 nose. The duration of all cross-modal sensory stimuli was 2 s. The choice of stimulus identity and intensity was consistent with existing studies showing that rats can easily detect the stimuli we used. Puffs of air on a single or on multiple whiskers have been used as either cues or sensory stimuli in multiple studies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brecht and Sakmann, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Derdikman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Civillico and Contreras, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ollerenshaw et al., 2012a</a>).

Auditory stimuli with a\u00a0frequency and intensity similar to the ones used here have been used to condition rats in prior studies from our laboratory (<a href=\"#bib57\">Samuelsen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gardner and Fontanini, 2014</a>) and as stimuli to be discriminated (<a href=\"#bib6\">Centanni et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Xiong et al., 2015</a>). Finally, several studies demonstrate that rats can easily detect and discriminate the odor Isoamyl acetate when presented at the concentration equal or lower to the one (0.1%) used in this study (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barnes et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wesson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Devore et al., 2013</a>).

For each neuron and for each stimulus we analyzed the CDF in the time interval starting 1 s before and ending 2 s (cross-modal stimuli) or 2.5 s (taste stimuli) after stimulus delivery. Sudden changes in firing rates resulted in a piecewise change in the CDF slope and in the identification of a CP. If no CP was detected for any of the stimuli, the neuron was deemed not responsive. By definition, a neuron was stimulus responsive if at least one significant CP was found after stimulus presentation. The CP analysis was also used to establish the sign of response, i.e., excitation or inhibition, and the average number of modulations (data shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, respectively).

The null hypothesis is that responses to different stimuli are independent from each other. Briefly, for the case of cross-modal responses we simulated 10,000 combinations of neurons each with the experimentally observed probability of responding to air puff (p(air puff)), odor (p(odor)), tone (p(tone)), and light (p(light)). Before learning, the experimentally observed parameters were as follows: number of neurons = 135; p(air puff) = 0.15; p(odor) = 0.16; p(tone) = 0.04; p(light) = 0.03. After learning: number of neurons = 118; p(air puff) = 0.34; p(odor) = 0.33; p(tone) = 0.16; p(light) = 0.11. For the case of the convergence between taste selectivity and cross-modal responsiveness we simulated 10,000 combinations of neurons with the following experimentally observed probabilities. Before learning: n = 135; the\u00a0probability of being taste selective = 0.64; the\u00a0probability of being cross-modal responsive = 0.33. After learning: n = 118; the\u00a0probability of being taste selective = 0.57; the\u00a0probability of being cross-modal responsive = 0.58.

This method determines how well a given cross-modal stimulus is encoded by a population of neurons in a given temporal bin and is grounded on both a cross-validation procedure as well as a Euclidean distance-based classifier. To compute a population decoding analysis of cross-modal stimuli on both untrained and trained rats, we constructed a 'pseudo-population' of neurons, collecting units from different sessions and rats under the same stimulus condition. Each cross-modal stimulus was denoted as a point in a 2 dimensional vector space (R x C) of firing rates, where R is the number of units included in the pseudo-population (only units from sessions with at least 8 trials for each cross-modal stimulus were considered), and C is the number of temporal bins. To assess the statistical significance of the decoding analysis (confidence interval, CI), we used a bootstrap procedure in which we sampled with replacement a subset of 80% of the neurons from the whole population for each bootstrap run (100 bootstrap runs were used). Significant decoding was defined by the lower bound of 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (CI) larger than chance level (0.25)."

We then computed the absolute difference of the average pixel intensity of the ROI across consecutive frames (referred as \u2206 pixel intensity in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). These values were normalized to background pixel intensity (as obtained from a second region of interest selected away from the orofacial region) to correct for changes due to fluctuations in background light intensity. This procedure allowed us to have a continuous (bin = 33 ms) record of mouth movements (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To monitor conditioning, mouth movements were averaged across trial types and analyzed in three temporal epochs: before stimulus onset (1 s before; referred in the text and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> as Spontaneous epoch), during stimulus (from 0.5 to 1.5 s following stimulus onset; referred in the text and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> as Cue epoch) and after sucrose presentation (from 2.7 to 3.7 s after cue onset; referred in the text and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> as Taste epoch). For data shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, to avoid differences in the magnitude of orofacial movement recorded from different rats, single mouth movement trials were also normalized to the maximum value recorded in the 'taste' epoch interval analyzed. Trials in which the rat\u2019s mouth was already in motion or in which view of the orofacial region was obstructed were not included in the analysis."

The authors described responses to stimuli (specifically, an air puff, an odor, a light stimulus, and a tone) from varying modalities (somatosensory, olfaction, vision, and audition) when these stimuli were either paired or unpaired with a subsequent delivery of sucrose. As the animals learned this association, (as measured by anticipatory licking), neurons in gustatory cortex (GC) begin to respond to these non-taste stimuli in greater numbers. The authors' claims are supported by the data and the analyses performed. One strength of this work is that the authors presented trained rats with a battery of tastes to show that an increase in cross-modal responses is likely not due to a general increase in responsiveness. Further, they go to efforts to demonstrate that learned orofacial behaviors in anticipation of sucrose are not distinguishable following stimuli in the learned state, whereas neural response fractions and form differ. And while cross-modal stimuli are quite distinguishable early in training at the beginning and end of the stimulus delivery, in the learned state, responses across the ensemble evolve in such a way that stimuli with similar associability become self-similar."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, cue-sucrose associations occurred at day 3 for olfactory and somatosensory cues, and day 7 for auditory and visual cues. In order to evaluate the fraction of cue-responding GC neurons after matching the number of recording sessions at final behavioral performance, we analyzed sessions on days 15, 16, 17 for olfactory and somatosensory stimuli and sessions on days 19, 20, 21 for auditory and visual stimuli. Analysis on this smaller set of data confirmed the results presented for the entire dataset.
