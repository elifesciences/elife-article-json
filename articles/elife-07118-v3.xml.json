It has remained enigmatic how this is accomplished. Here, we show that envelope machines facilitating septal PG synthesis (PBP1B-LpoB complex) and OM constriction (Tol system) are physically and functionally coordinated via YbgF, renamed CpoB (<b>C</b>oordinator of <b>P</b>G synthesis and <b>O</b>M constriction, associated with PBP1<b>B</b>). CpoB localizes to the septum concurrent with PBP1B-LpoB and Tol at the onset of constriction, interacts with both complexes, and regulates PBP1B activity in response to Tol energy state. This coordination links PG synthesis with OM invagination and imparts a unique mode of bifunctional PG synthase regulation by selectively modulating PBP1B cross-linking activity. Coordination of the PBP1B and Tol machines by CpoB contributes to effective PBP1B function in vivo and maintenance of cell envelope integrity during division."

It has remained enigmatic how this is accomplished. Here, we show that envelope machines facilitating septal PG synthesis (PBP1B-LpoB complex) and OM constriction (Tol system) are physically and functionally coordinated via YbgF, renamed CpoB (<b>C</b>oordinator of <b>P</b>G synthesis and <b>O</b>M constriction, associated with PBP1<b>B</b>). CpoB localizes to the septum concurrent with PBP1B-LpoB and Tol at the onset of constriction, interacts with both complexes, and regulates PBP1B activity in response to Tol energy state. This coordination links PG synthesis with OM invagination and imparts a unique mode of bifunctional PG synthase regulation by selectively modulating PBP1B cross-linking activity. Coordination of the PBP1B and Tol machines by CpoB contributes to effective PBP1B function in vivo and maintenance of cell envelope integrity during division."

The sacculus, a continuous mesh-like structure of glycan strands cross-linked by short peptides, encases the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane (IM) and is essential for viability. Several prominent classes of antibiotics (e.g., \u03b2-lactams and glycopeptides) inhibit PG synthesis, causing lysis and cell death (<a href=\"#bib74\">Schneider and Sahl, 2010</a>). In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane (OM), an asymmetric bilayer of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides, surrounds the mostly single-layered sacculus (<a href=\"#bib34\">Gan et al., 2008</a>) and forms a vital permeability barrier (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nikaido, 2003</a>). Covalent and non-covalent interactions between abundant OM proteins (Lpp, Pal, OmpA) and PG tether the OM to the sacculus, maintaining OM stability (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hantke and Braun, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Parsons et al., 2006</a>). Together, the IM, PG, and OM comprise the tripartite Gram-negative cell envelope (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Bacteria must synchronize growth and division of these layers, as imbalanced growth could lead to breaches that compromise the permeability barrier or even the structural integrity of the cell.

Septal PG synthesis, principally orchestrated by PBP3 and PBP1B (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bertsche et al., 2006</a>), occurs at the leading edge of the inward-moving septum, adjacent to the invaginating IM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Consistent with this expectation, a strain lacking both CpoB and LpoA showed a severe growth defect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). To our surprise, however, a strain lacking both CpoB and PBP1A grew normally (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). We tracked down the reason for this discrepancy to a previously unknown function of LpoA. LpoA possesses two-domains, an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and a C-terminal domain (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A)</a>. The C-terminal domain is sufficient to bind and activate PBP1A in vitro (<a href=\"#bib84\">Typas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Jean et al., 2014</a>) and, we show here, in vivo (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). We found that the N-terminal TPR domain encodes an additional function that can compensate for loss of CpoB. As evidence, though a \u0394<i>cpoB</i> \u0394<i>mrcA</i> mutant has no growth defect, a triple mutant also lacking the LpoA TPR domain, \u0394<i>cpoB</i> \u0394<i>mrcA lpoA</i>(\u0394<i>TPR</i>), recapitulates the growth defect of the \u0394<i>cpoB</i> \u0394<i>lpoA</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>). Importantly, this CpoB compensatory function of LpoA is required only when PBP1B is the sole active bifunctional synthase, as a \u0394<i>cpoB lpoA</i>(\u0394<i>TPR</i>) mutant (in which PBP1A is active) grows normally (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>)."

Both \u0394<i>mrcB</i> and \u0394<i>cpoB</i> strains exhibited minor OM defects, including elevated levels of OM blebbing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>). As with the growth phenotype, these \u0394<i>cpoB</i> envelope defects were greatly exacerbated in the absence of LpoA, with extensive OM blebbing, periplasmic leakage and cell lysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). All of these effects were recapitulated in a \u0394<i>cpoB</i> \u0394<i>mrcA lpoA</i>(\u0394<i>TPR</i>) triple mutant (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B\u2013D</a>), and ameliorated by overexpression of PBP1B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B\u2013D</a>). Of note, the envelope defects of \u0394<i>cpoB</i> \u0394<i>lpoA</i> were distinct from those of <i>tol-pal</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gerding et al., 2007</a>), with more extensive lysis but less OM blebbing and periplasmic leakage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Taken together, these results validate further that CpoB contributes to proper PBP1B function in vivo; indicate that this function is important for envelope integrity, and particularly important when cells must rely on PBP1B; and serendipitously reveal a partial redundancy of function between CpoB and the LpoA TPR domain."

Using a functional, endogenously expressed CpoB-mCherry fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), we observed that CpoB localized at sites of visible envelope constriction in pre-divisional cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and was positioned preferentially at mid-cell with increasing prevalence as the cell cycle progressed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>).

CpoB also failed to localize following inhibition of PBP3 with aztreonam (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4G</a>), indicating that its localization also requires ongoing septal PG synthesis. However, CpoB localized normally in the absence of PBP1B (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). TolA dependence was more difficult to examine, since delayed OM constriction in the absence of TolA leads to the non-specific accumulation of periplasmic proteins at cell division sites (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gerding et al., 2007</a>). Under growth conditions that minimized this effect, CpoB continued to localize in the absence of TolA (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>), suggesting that it can be recruited independently of TolA.

Although weaker than the eightfold stimulation by LpoB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Egan et al., 2014</a>), TolA and LpoB stimulations were additive, together yielding an 11.3 \u00b1 0.5-fold increase in GTase activity. These results indicate that LpoB and TolA stimulate PBP1B GTase activity by compatible mechanisms. In contrast, CpoB had no effect on the GTase activity of PBP1B, alone or in combination with LpoB and/or TolA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

Note that, unlike for GTase activity, a continuous TPase assay is currently not available, and therefore we cannot rule out that one of the two proteins affects the TPase rate of PBP1B; this would in fact be expected for TolA as a consequence of GTase activation (see below)."

LpoB activates both the PBP1B GTase domain, increasing reaction rate, and the TPase domain, thereby producing hyper-cross-linked PG (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, blue; <a href=\"#bib84\">Typas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Egan et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, although CpoB did not affect the cross-linking activity of PBP1B on its own, it partially prevented the formation of hyper-cross-linked PG in the presence of LpoB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, blue). As CpoB affected neither LpoB binding to PBP1B (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) nor GTase stimulation of PBP1B (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), CpoB must directly interfere with LpoB activation of the PBP1B TPase. Strikingly, TolA alleviated the inhibitory effect of CpoB, restoring the synthesis of highly cross-linked PG in the presence of LpoB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, cyan). The effect of CpoB on TPase activity was further enhanced at a moderately increased salt concentration (215 mM NaCl), suggesting that its regulatory effect on PBP1B may be intensified under stress. In this condition, LpoB increased cross-linking from 50% to 60%. The addition of CpoB completely prevented this stimulation, whereas TolA again alleviated the CpoB effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, right graph). Though the magnitudes of these effects are moderate, they are likely significant in vivo given the essentiality of LpoB for PBP1B function under all conditions tested (<a href=\"#bib68\">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Typas et al., 2010</a>), including different salt concentrations<a href=\"#bib68\">. In summary, interaction of the PBP1B-LpoB synthase complex with TolA further stimulates PBP1B GTase activity, and interactions with CpoB and TolA modulate PBP1B TPase activity via reciprocal effects.</a>"

In addition to the previously reported PBP1B-LpoB pair (<a href=\"#bib84\">Typas et al., 2010</a>), we observed specific pairwise interactions between CpoB, TolA, and PBP1B, validating that these interactions also occur in vivo. Interestingly, CpoB exhibited minimal or no cross-linking with LpoB in the presence of TolA, but a dramatic increase in cross-linking in its absence (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Thus, TolA both prevents CpoB from associating with LpoB (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and from interfering with PBP1B TPase stimulation by LpoB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), suggesting that these effects are linked. Since an interaction between CpoB and LpoB was not detected in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), their association in vivo likely occurs in the context of the CpoB-PBP1B-LpoB ternary complex (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This possibility could not be tested directly because a strain lacking both PBP1B and TolA is only marginally viable (<a href=\"#bib84\">Typas et al., 2010</a>). TolA did not prevent PBP1B from interacting with CpoB (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>); thus, interaction with TolA may instead alter the conformation of CpoB in a manner that both prevents it from interacting with LpoB (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and, concurrently, from modulating PBP1B TPase activation by LpoB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

LpoB binds the PBP1B UB2H domain, while CpoB binds in an adjacent cleft between the UB2H and TPase domains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We propose that CpoB can contact LpoB in this conformation, preventing hyper-activation of the PBP1B TPase by LpoB. TolA counteracts this CpoB effect, and increases both PBP1B TPase activity (by restoring stimulation by LpoB) and GTase activity (directly).

In the absence of TolQ, abrogating formation of the TolQR\u2013TolA complex, PBP1B-TolA and PBP1B-CpoB interactions were both substantially diminished. In contrast, CpoB\u2013LpoB interaction and PBP1B-LpoB complex formation increased significantly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Together, these data suggested that CpoB regulates PBP1B-LpoB in response to Tol assembly state, energy state, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the effects of a <i>tolR</i> deletion, which prevents TolQR\u2013TolA complex assembly, to those of a <i>tolR</i>(D23R) point mutation that allows complex assembly but prevents TolQR\u2013TolA from utilizing PMF (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cascales et al., 2001</a>). In the <i>tolR</i>(D23R) mutant, interaction between TolA and PBP1B was maintained (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting that physical association between PBP1B-LpoB and Tol depends on assembly of the TolQR\u2013TolA complex in vivo but not on its energy state. In contrast, interaction between CpoB and LpoB was highly elevated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This strongly suggests that TolQR\u2013TolA must be energized for TolA to prevent CpoB both from interacting with LpoB and, in conjunction, from inhibiting PBP1B TPase stimulation by LpoB. This implies that cycles of TolQR\u2013TolA PMF utilization and energization can in turn modulate PBP1B TPase activity, allowing dynamic regulation of PBP1B activity in response to Tol energy state."

In this work, we present a mechanism for coordinating PG synthesis and OM constriction, featuring CpoB, previously of unknown function, as its centerpiece. The PBP1B-LpoB and Tol machines facilitate PG synthesis and OM constriction, respectively, at the closely-spaced leading and trailing edges of the invaginating envelope (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We demonstrate that CpoB connects these processes, promoting physical and functional coordination of the PBP1B-LpoB and Tol machines. We found that both CpoB and TolA interact directly with PBP1B, and our in vitro data support formation of a higher order complex (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). As depicted in our summary model, interactions between PBP1B, LpoB, CpoB, and TolA allow for dynamic regulation of PBP1B activity, and thus functional coordination of the PBP1B and Tol machines (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

Therefore, CpoB reduces cross-linkage to a more physiological level. This may be the default cellular state, as CpoB is present in \u223c10-fold excess over its PBP1B and TolA binding partners (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Li et al., 2014</a>).

PBP1B-LpoB has the capacity to produce highly cross-linked PG, which may be required at certain stages of new pole synthesis, but the TPase activity of PBP1B is normally down-regulated by CpoB. Up-regulation is allowed only during energized phases of Tol function. Thus, for PBP1B-LpoB at the septal leading edge, increased cross-linking (TPase) activity is permitted only when the OM is brought into close proximity\u2014as facilitated by cycles of Tol function and energy utilization\u2014allowing energized TolQR\u2013TolA to counteract CpoB. The IM-bound septal leading edge can thereby sense and respond the status of the trailing edge of the constricting envelope (i.e. the OM), and activity cycles of the two machines are synchronized, helping to ensure a constant distance between the OM and IM. Restricting TPase activity based on Tol status may also promote better coordination of septal PG synthesis and septal cleavage by OM-controlled amidases (<a href=\"#bib86\">Uehara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Yang et al., 2011</a>)."

The importance of such coordination can be seen when it is broken, as demonstrated by the phenotypes of a strain lacking CpoB. Multiple antibiotic sensitivities, envelope defects, and genetic interactions paralleling those of a strain lacking PBP1B suggested that CpoB contributes to proper PBP1B function in vivo, an interpretation bolstered by the facts that PBP1B overexpression alleviated these \u0394<i>cpoB</i> phenotypes and a strain lacking both proteins phenocopied a PBP1B mutant. Envelope defects in the absence of CpoB were relatively mild, likely because redundant mechanisms compensate for loss of coordination by CpoB (e.g., LpoA TPR domain function, discussed below). Yet defects were greatly exacerbated under osmotic stress (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) or in the absence of LpoA function (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B\u2013D</a>), indicating that coordination by CpoB becomes more crucial under stress and/or when cells must rely more heavily on PBP1B function. Apparent loss of PBP1B function in the absence of CpoB may result from loss of proper coordination with Tol that is required for efficient and productive utilization of PBP1B activity during septation. In addition, loss of TPase modulation may itself be deleterious, as uncontrolled PG synthase activity can be as detrimental to the cell as no activity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cho et al., 2014</a>). Synthetic and hydrolytic enzymatic reactions have to be carefully balanced for seamless PG growth, a principle exploited by \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, which lyse cells predominantly via uncontrolled PG hydrolase activity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kohlrausch and H\u00f6ltje, 1991</a>). In this scenario, overexpression of PBP1B may alleviate \u0394<i>cpoB</i> phenotypes by ensuring that there is enough unbound (hypoactive) PBP1B in the cell to counter-balance hyperactive PBP1B-LpoB in septal PG synthesis."

It is thus more difficult to determine specific regulatory effects of CpoB and PBP1B on Tol activity.

In this regard, our finding that LpoA has an additional function beyond activating PBP1A, one that is redundant with (or otherwise exacerbates the need for) CpoB and is independent of PBP1A, is particularly interesting. First, it extends for the first time the principle of modularity to PG enzyme regulators, as LpoA has two physically separated domains: one for binding and activating PBP1A (C-terminal domain) and one for its CpoB-related function (N-terminal TPR domain). Second, as both CpoB and LpoA possess TPR domains, which are generally involved in protein\u2013protein interactions, it raises the question of whether both their TPR domains are involved in additional binding and/or regulation with other PG-related enzymes. Such function(s) could be independent of PBP1A/B binding and regulation. An alternative scenario, which would explain the CpoB and LpoA redundancy, is that LpoA can directly link to the Tol system. In contrast to CpoB, we could not detect a direct interaction between LpoA and soluble TolA in vitro. However, the LpoA connection to TolA may be more complex (e.g., dependent on conformational state of TolA), or LpoA may achieve a CpoB-like function via connections to other Tol components. Such a connection would be consistent with the ability of PBP1A to partially substitute for PBP1B, and with the general role of the Tol system in envelope integrity. As all these components (PBP1B/A, LpoB/A, CpoB, and Tol) localize independently to division sites, multiple redundant or alternative paths may exist for coordinating PG synthesis and OM constriction, increasing the robustness of the process to function under different conditions and across different organisms."

To measure fluorescence profiles along cell outlines, fluorescence intensity was measured along segmented cell contours with a spacing of 1 pixel (0.064 \u00b5m). Cells were defined as exhibiting periplasmic leakage if their median contour fluorescence fell below a threshold defined as the 98th percentile of \u0394<i>tolA</i> cell contour fluorescence. To identify blebs, we first located all fluorescent puncta with average brightness above the 99.7th percentile of WT cell brightness, and with an area smaller than 4 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>. Blebs were then defined as isolated bright puncta within 0.3 \u00b5m of a segmented cell."

The FtsZ(ts) strain LMC509 (<a href=\"#bib79\">Taschner et al., 1988</a>) is not completely temperature sensitive; consequently, CpoB still localizes at mid-cell in shorter cells in this strain; however, in long smooth cells, no mid-cell localization is seen. The PBP3(ts) strain LMC510 (<a href=\"#bib79\">Taschner et al., 1988</a>) is already somewhat elongated at the permissive temperature due to the presence of an unstable PBP3 molecule (<a href=\"#bib32\">Fraipont et al., 2011</a>). The FtsW(ts) strain JLB17 is not isogenic to LMC500 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ishino et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Mohammadi et al., 2014</a>) and was grown in Lennox LB medium without salt and with 1% glucose and 20 mg/mL of thymine at 28\u00b0C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3. Strain JOE565 (FtsN depletion) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen and Beckwith, 2001</a>) was grown in Lennox LB with 0.2% arabinose at 28\u00b0C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3.

For aztreonam treatment (inhibits PBP3), LMC500 was grown in glucose minimal medium at 28\u00b0C to an OD<sub>450</sub> of 0.2. The culture was then split and diluted 1:4 into medium with or without 2 \u03bcg/mL aztreonam and grown for an additional two mass doublings."

The initial coordinates of the CpoB, PBP1B, and LpoB molecules were taken from the PBP1B crystal structure (PDB code 3VMA) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Sung et al., 2009</a>), the CpoB crystal structure from the N-terminal domain (2XDJ) and the C-terminal TPR domain (2XEV) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Krachler et al., 2010</a>), and from the LpoB NMR structure (2MII) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Egan et al., 2014</a>). During the multi-body docking, ambiguous restraints were applied to drive the docking according to the different experimental data.

However, this assumption has been challenged (</i><a href=\"#bib9\"><i>Bonsor et al., 2009</i></a> <i>EMBO J. 28:2846). Bonsor et al. could detect no interaction between TolA and Pal, and Pal was shown to inhibit the interaction between TolA and TolB, and these results question the existence of a transenvelope Tol-Pal complex. Accordingly, the authors need to be more cautious about the claim made in the title, the renaming of YbgF, the model shown in</i> <a href=\"#fig7\"><i>Figure 7</i></a><i>, and the use of the Tol-Pal phrase</i>."

We do prefer, however, to keep the name \u2018CpoB\u2019 because: 1) CpoB localizes to mid-cell during OM constriction, concurrent with TolA and PBP1B; 2) OM defects we observe are also consistent with a role in OM constriction; 3) the name does not assume a specific mechanism of Tol function, only a role in OM constriction; and 4) overall, we feel the name encapsulates our findings and the functional role we have identified."
