Its diverse mechanisms provide the regulatory network with a bigger repertoire to increase complexity. Here we report a novel LncRNA, Lnc34a, that is enriched in colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs) and initiates asymmetric division by directly targeting the microRNA miR-34a to cause its spatial imbalance. Lnc34a recruits Dnmt3a via PHB2 and HDAC1 to methylate and deacetylate the miR-34a promoter simultaneously, hence epigenetically silencing miR-34a expression independent of its upstream regulator, p53. Lnc34a levels affect CCSC self-renewal and colorectal cancer (CRC) growth in xenograft models. Lnc34a is upregulated in late-stage CRCs, contributing to epigenetic miR-34a silencing and CRC proliferation. The fact that lncRNA targets microRNA highlights the regulatory complexity of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which occupy the bulk of the genome."

Its diverse mechanisms provide the regulatory network with a bigger repertoire to increase complexity. Here we report a novel LncRNA, Lnc34a, that is enriched in colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs) and initiates asymmetric division by directly targeting the microRNA miR-34a to cause its spatial imbalance. Lnc34a recruits Dnmt3a via PHB2 and HDAC1 to methylate and deacetylate the miR-34a promoter simultaneously, hence epigenetically silencing miR-34a expression independent of its upstream regulator, p53. Lnc34a levels affect CCSC self-renewal and colorectal cancer (CRC) growth in xenograft models. Lnc34a is upregulated in late-stage CRCs, contributing to epigenetic miR-34a silencing and CRC proliferation. The fact that lncRNA targets microRNA highlights the regulatory complexity of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which occupy the bulk of the genome."

For example, a microRNA molecule called miR-34a suppresses the activity of several genes \u2013 which slows the growth of various tumors, including lung and bowel cancers.

Asymmetric division allows stem cells to maintain self-renewal while generating a heterogeneous population for cellular diversity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Reya et al., 2001</a>). Tumor cells are usually heterogeneous and have a wide range of potential for tumorigenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. Recent studies have reported that cancer cells, including colorectal, glioma, lung and breast cancer cells, could also divide asymmetrically, generating progenies with different proliferation capabilities (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dey-Guha et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lathia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">O'Brien et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pece et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pine et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sugiarto et al., 2011</a>).

Asymmetric distribution of Lnc34a during colon cancer stem cell (CCSC) division leads to asymmetric daughter cell fate. Its suppression leads to differentiation while its abundance leads to CCSC proliferation via symmetric self-renewal. Lnc34a tends to be upregulated in late-stage CRC, associated with miR-34a silencing. The ability of lncRNA to target microRNA provides RNA circuitry more ways to increases the complexity of the regulatory network."

Lnc34a knockdown decreased asymmetric division while increasing symmetric, ALDH1-/ALDH1- division (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). We then ectopically expressed Lnc34a using lentiviral vectors. Higher level of ectopic Lnc34a was detected in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Ectopic Lnc34a expression also decreased asymmetric division, but increased symmetric, ALDH1+/ALDH1+ division instead (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). The phenotype was rescued by ectopic miR-34a expression, suggesting that Lnc34a regulates symmetry through miR-34a (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). The same trend was observed with CD133 staining (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>).

RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) using specific antibodies against Dnmt3a, HDAC1 and PHB2 further confirmed the interactions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast, RNA pulldown and RIP did not detect any interaction between Lnc34a and Dnmt1, an enzyme that plays important roles in maintaining methylation during DNA replication (data not shown)."

Interaction between the fragments and their cognate proteins were further validated by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Incubation of labeled RNA probes Lnc34a:1\u2013267\u00a0bp with recombinant HDAC1 and Lnc34a:560\u2013690\u00a0bp with recombinant PHB2 resulted in specific gel retardation, while unlabeled RNA probes of the same fragments competitively disrupted those binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>).

We demonstrate that a lncRNA, Lnc34a, can initiate CCSC asymmetric division by targeting miR-34a. Previously, lncRNAs like HOTAIR and Xist have been shown to cause histone H3 lysine 27 methylation or lysine 4 demethylation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gupta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tsai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). Here, Lnc34a binds to the miR-34a promoter via its middle fragment, and recruits PHB2/Dnmt3a and HDAC1 via its flanking sequences to methylate and deacetylate the promoter, silencing miR-34a expression. This process reminds us of the ordered steps of protein-mediated DNA methylation\u2014a DNA binding protein first interacts with the promoter, via which DNA methyltransferases are further recruited (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Serra et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wajapeyee et al., 2013</a>)."

This effect is mediated by miR-34a, which has been shown to target factors of Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, both of which are essential for CCSC self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). In late-stage CRC, Lnc34a expression and miR-34a promoter methylation is upregulated, while miR-34a expression is downregulated. Lnc34a demonstrates that lncRNA can target microRNA for cellular control. Given that lncRNAs occupy the majority of the genome (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</a>), lncRNA/microRNA circuitry can potentially increase the complexity of regulatory networks."

However, the discovery of Lnc34a demonstrates an alternative, epigenetic mechanism that cancer cells can utilize to silence miR-34a without having to mutate p53. Although p53 knockout has been reported to reduce asymmetric division in mammary stem cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cicalese et al., 2009</a>), p53 is not known to be a major regulator of differentiation and is symmetric during CCSC division. Lnc34a provides normal and cancer cells a way to decouple mir-34a mediated cell fate decisions from p53, which may be present in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells."

Epigenetic silencing is due to the ability of lnc34a to recruit PHB2, HDAC1 and DNMT3a. The authors show that Lnc34a levels affect CCSC self-renewal and colorectal cancer (CRC) growth in xenograft models. In addition, Lnc34a is upregulated in late-stage CRCs, contributing to epigenetic miR-34a silencing and CRC proliferation. Finally, the authors report that Lnc34a is initiates asymmetric cell division of CCSCs and is asymmetrically distributed."

For example, ectopically express lnc34a in an appropriate cell type and show that the phenotype can be reversed by ectopically expressing mir34a. For example, this could be done using the cell type and readout in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>. How do the authors envision that lnc34a is targeted to mir34a? Do they think this is by base-pairing or RNA loop formation? Any experimental results on this question would provide deeper understanding of how lncRNAs mediate epigenetic silencing. An initial experiment might be to ectopically express lnc34a truncation derivatives (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) to identify the region(s) of lnc34a required for silencing."
