In this report, we provide converging evidence indicating that a splice variant isoform of the <i>Acbd7</i> mRNA is expressed and translated by some POMC and GABAergic-neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). We have demonstrated that the ARC ACBD7 isoform was produced and processed into a bioactive peptide referred to as nonadecaneuropeptide (NDN) in response to catabolic signals. We have characterized NDN as a potent anorexigenic signal acting through an uncharacterized endozepine G protein-coupled receptor and subsequently via the melanocortin system. Our results suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons participate in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons are involved in the hypothalamic control exerted on food intake and energy expenditure by the leptin-melanocortin pathway."

In this report, we provide converging evidence indicating that a splice variant isoform of the <i>Acbd7</i> mRNA is expressed and translated by some POMC and GABAergic-neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). We have demonstrated that the ARC ACBD7 isoform was produced and processed into a bioactive peptide referred to as nonadecaneuropeptide (NDN) in response to catabolic signals. We have characterized NDN as a potent anorexigenic signal acting through an uncharacterized endozepine G protein-coupled receptor and subsequently via the melanocortin system. Our results suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons participate in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons are involved in the hypothalamic control exerted on food intake and energy expenditure by the leptin-melanocortin pathway."

To treat it effectively, we must understand how the body controls how much food a person consumes and how much energy they expend. The hypothalamus is one region of the brain that plays a critical role in regulating this energy balance. Some of the neurons in the hypothalamus can change their activity when they detect satiety hormones including the leptin, which is produced by fat cells and suppresses appetite. However, it is not clear exactly how the neurons respond to leptin and other energy-related signals."

The control of food intake and energy expenditure, hence the regulation of energy balance, is assured by interconnected neurons of various brain regions, which include the hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib32\">Morton et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Schwartz et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">Richard, 2015</a>). Among all the hypothalamic nuclei, the arcuate nucleus (ARC), which hosts proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) / neuropeptide (NPY) - producing neurons, has emerged as a prominent structure in the control of both food intake and energy expenditure (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krashes et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">Mayer and Belsham, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">Luquet et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">Gropp et al., 2005</a>). POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons are major constituents of the melanocortin system, which is recognized to genuinely govern energy balance regulation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adan et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Butler, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">Cone, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">De Jonghe et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">Ellacott and Cone, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). POMC neurons release \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), which induces hypophagic and thermogenic effects, mainly through the stimulation of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adan et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Butler, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">Cone, 2006</a>). AgRP has been described as an inverse (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chai et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">Haskell-Luevano and Monck, 2001</a>) or biased (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buch et al., 2009</a>) agonist of this receptor. In this context, the understanding of the mechanisms whereby the melanocortin regulate energy homeostasis is critical to unravel the \u201cphysiopathology\u201d of obesity."

EZs are described as glial endogenous peptides (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tonon et al., 1990</a>), which are derived from the diazepam-binding inhibitor/Acyl-CoA binding protein (<i>Dbi/Acbp</i>) gene (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mogensen et al., 1987</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">Ferrero et al., 1984</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">Corda et al., 1984</a>), and which include DBI/ACBP itself, the triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN) and the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). EZs were initially characterized for their ability to displace benzodiazepines from their binding sites (i.e. the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>-R) and the translocator protein (TSPO) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ferrero et al., 1984</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">Slobodyansky et al., 1989</a>). Recently, ODN emerged as endogenous modulator of the brain melanocortin signalling pathway and as a potential actor in the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lanfray et al., 2013</a>), by acting via an uncharacterized G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (<a href=\"#bib17\">do Rego et al., 2007</a>). Further supporting the role of <i>Dbi/Acbp</i> products in energy balance, a study conducted in humans by Comuzzie and collaborators (<a href=\"#bib12\">Comuzzie et al., 2012</a>), indicates that <i>DBI/ACBP</i> single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with obesity, supporting the relevance of the DBI/ACBP production in energy homeostasis. Interestingly, Comuzzie and collaborators (<a href=\"#bib12\">Comuzzie et al., 2012</a>) also identified a SNP in a well-conserved paralog gene of the <i>DBI/ACBP</i>, referred as Acyl-CoA binding domain containing 7 (<i>ACBD7</i>), as associated to obesity in humans (<a href=\"#bib12\">Comuzzie et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that <i>ACBD7</i> could be involved in energy homeostasis through encoding products related to EZs."

Double immunostaining performed on brain sections of colchicine-treated mice revealed that ACBD7 was not stained in glial cells (GFAP) in the MBH (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g,h</a>).

We observed that 18\u2009hr of fasting was sufficient to reduce <i>Acbd7</i> mRNA levels in the ARC of control mice by about 50%, whereas refeeding (2h) restored <i>Acbd7</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1o</a>). Notably, no effect of fasting or even refeeding challenge was observed on Acbd7 mRNA levels in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1p</a>). Additionally, western blot analysis performed on MBH extract using fasted mice as controls, indicated that refeeding (6h) increased the protein levels of ACBD7 by about 3 times (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1q,r</a>), suggesting that both <i>Acbd7</i> mRNA and ACBD7 protein levels in the ARC correlated with the body energy status. Thereafter, we assessed by MRM-MS the impact of refeeding challenge on the maturation of ACBD7<sub>89</sub> into NDN, within the MBH. Consistently with our previous results, the MBH levels of NDN increased 2 fold after 2\u2009hr of refeeding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1s</a>), suggesting that production of ACBD7<sub>89</sub> and its processing into NDN was influenced by the energy status."

                                "text": "To address the impact of ACBD7 maturation products on feeding behaviour, we examined the effect of intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of graded doses of NDN on food intake and compared it with that of the ACBD7<sub>88</sub>-derived peptide ACBD7<sub>88\u00a0(34-51)</sub>. We also tested the effect of the C-terminal octapeptide of NDN, i.e. the NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub> (ACBD7<sub>89\u00a0(45-52)</sub>). The injections were done in fasted mice. We observed that all injected compounds led to anorexigenic effects that were seen as early as 30 min after injection. However, dose/response experiments indicate that the optimal concentrations to cause hypophagia differed for each peptide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). Indeed, a potent inhibition of food intake was observed in mice administrated with 10 ng (5.1 10<sup>\u201312</sup> mol) of NDN (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), while this effect was only achieved when 100 ng (5.3 10<sup>\u201311</sup> mol) of the ACBD7<sub>88 (34-51)</sub> fragment were icv-injected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). Consistently, NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub>, the common C-terminal octapeptide of ACBD7<sub>88\u00a0(34-51)</sub> and NDN was efficient for doses as low as 5 ng (5.6 10<sup>\u201312</sup> mol) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>), suggesting that the biological activity of the ACBD7-derived peptides is ensured by this well-conserved fragment. Furthermore, we observed that the anorexigenic effect induced by NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub> was not present 24\u2009hr after the icv injection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). Interestingly, comparison of the efficiency of each peptide, 3\u2009hr after injection, revealed that NDN as well as NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub> are both 10 times more potent than ACBD7<sub>88\u00a0(34-51)</sub>, in reducing food intake by 50% (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). We also monitored the energy expenditure after acute NDN (10 ng) icv injection in fasted mice. NDN increased the energy expenditure in mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e,f</a>), while increasing the O<sub>2</sub> consumption (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>) and CO<sub>2</sub> production (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h</a>), without affecting the respiratory quotient (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2i</a>) or the physical activity pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2j</a>), over 6\u2009hr following the icv injection. Consistently with those results, experiments performed on fasted mice also revealed that acute icv injection of NDN (10 ng) led to significant increase in the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (<i>Ucp1</i>) mRNA level in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), 4\u2009hr after treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2k</a>), thus suggesting that NDN might stimulate thermogenesis in mice."

                                "text": "We also investigated the nature of the hypothalamic pathway relaying the anorexigenic effect of NDN in mice. Previous investigations performed in rodents, using the non-selective antagonist of the MC3/4 receptors, namely SHU-9119 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lanfray et al., 2013</a>), indicated that the anorexigenic effect of the ODN was relayed by the activation of the melanocortin system (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lanfray et al., 2013</a>). In that respect, we next evaluated the impact of NDN on the hypothalamic levels of <i>Pomc</i>, <i>Npy</i> and <i>Agrp</i> mRNAs. We observed that icv injection of NDN in fasted mice induced an increase in <i>Pomc</i> mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b,c</a>) but failed to affect the mRNA levels of <i>Agrp</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d,e,f</a>) and <i>Npy</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g,h,i</a>), suggesting that NDN was able to directly activate POMC but not AgRP/NPY neurons. Converging evidence indicating that the MC4R is the prominent melanocortin receptor in the hypothalamic regulation of whole body energy homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Butler and Cone, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">Seeley et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Butler, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">Ellacott and Cone, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">Richard, 2015</a>), led us to evaluate the potential involvement of the MC4R signalling pathway in the effect of NDN. We observed that the anorexigenic effect induced by the icv injection of NDN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4j</a>) was blocked by the injection of\u00a0the MC4R-specific antagonist (HS024\u2014100 ng). Consistently, our investigations also revealed that the icv injection of NDN failed to induce anorexigenic effects in MC4R knock-out mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4k</a>), further confirming the involvement of the melanocortin system and more specifically the MC4R as a relay in the anorexigenic effect of NDN. Additionally, investigation performed using mice hypothalamic explants revealed that NDN increases the release of the POMC-derived peptide, \u03b1-MSH, by 50% times after 45 min of treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4l</a>). We also investigated the impact of intra-MBH injection of NDN on food intake. We observed that NDN injection in the MBH led to a significant reduction in food intake for the first 5\u2009hr following the central administration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4m</a>), suggesting that the anorexigenic effect of NDN is relayed by the activation of POMC neurons."

In that regard, we investigated whether NDN could contribute to the hypothalamic leptin signalling. We examined ACBD7 and NDN levels in the hypothalamus of fasted mice icv-injected with leptin (2 \u00b5g) using both Western blot and MS-MRM. We observed that the hypothalamic level of ACBD7 was increased more than 3 times (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a and b</a>) while levels of NDN were increased by around 50% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>) only 2\u2009hr after the icv injection, suggesting that both ACBD7 and NDN levels are dynamically regulated by the leptin in the ARC. We observed that the anorexigenic effect induced by the icv injection of leptin was partially blunted by the co-injection of the LV-1075 (1000 ng; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), while it was totally abolished by the co-injection of HS024 (100 ng; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>) alone or with LV-1075 (1000 ng; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Interestingly, co-injection of HS024 and LV-1075 was not associated with any additional effects on leptin induced inhibition of food intake (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Altogether, these results suggest that the endogenous EZ GPCR signalling, specifically its activation by NDN, is a part of the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway that acts <i>via</i> the melanocortin signalling pathway. Finally, we investigated the impact of chronic injections of either NDN or LV-1075 on the food intake and body weight of mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e,f</a>). We observed that NDN induced a transient inhibition of food intake after two days of treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>), while a consistent reduction in body weight could be seen until the end of the treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>). Consistently, we also observed a significant increase in both food intake (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>) and body weight (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>) in the mice injected daily with LV-1075 after two days of treatment."

This splice variant encoded a protein referred as ACBD7<sub>89</sub> which is processed into a bioactive 19-amino-acid fragment, that we called NDN (i.e. ACBD7<sub>89\u00a0(34-52)</sub>). Furthermore, our experiments performed in mice indicate that NDN constitutes a anorexigenic peptide, seemingly acting through an uncharacterized EZ GPCR receptor and subsequently through a pathway involving the MC4R signalling.

Here we confirm that <i>Acbd7</i> mRNA is found in selective regions in the mouse CNS. Those regions include the accumbens nucleus (Acb), median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), supraoptic nucleus (SON), PVN and ARC, which represent structures known to be involved in various behavioural and physiological regulation processes, including energy homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Morton et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Schwartz et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">Richard, 2015</a>).

MRM-MS experiments further indicated that endogenous NDN was found in mouse MBH lysates, confirming that hypothalamic cells are capable of processing ACBD7<sub>89</sub> isoform into shorter fragments. This result further underlines that maturation processes of ACBD7<sub>89</sub> and DBI/ACBP, which lead to the production of NDN and ODN, respectively, have been well conserved during the evolution, suggesting that both maturation products have essential physiological functions. Nonetheless, our investigation does not allow for excluding the endogenous production of the ACBD7<sub>88\u00a0(34-51)</sub> fragment in the mouse CNS. Finally, given the structure homology between ACBD7 and DBI/ACBP, and specifically the conservation of the Lys<sup>18</sup> in the ACBD7 sequence, one can argue that brain cells could have the ability to produce several TTN-like compounds consisting of ACBD7<sub>88\u00a0(18-51)</sub> and ACBD7<sub>89\u00a0(18-52)</sub>. Likewise, considering the marked selective pressure that have occurred on those two paralog genes, future investigations will be important in assessing the ability of ACBD7 to act as an acyl-CoA carrier, as is for DBI/ACBP."

Our study, which mainly focused on the ARC, further indicated that ACBD7 is produced by some POMC neurons, as well as by some GABAergic neurons.

In our study, we did not observe immunolabeling of ACBD7 without prior treatment with either colchicine or 3-MA. These results suggest that similar to DBI/ACBP, ACBD7 is likely processed into NDN and secreted in vivo by an autophagosome-based unconventional secretory pathway."

Furthermore, the anorexigenic effect of NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub> was not observed 24\u2009hr after icv injection, suggesting that the half-life of NDN-related peptides is short in vivo. In addition, we also observed that dose response investigations performed with either NDN or its related peptides resulted in a U-shaped dose response curve, suggesting that high concentration of NDN can non-specifically stimulate hypothalamic orexigenic pathways.

In contrast, our investigation also revealed that the anorexigenic effect of NDN was blunted by the co-injection of the antagonist of the EZ GPCR, suggesting that similarly to ODN, NDN is also capable to act via the EZ GPCR to induce its effect.

Using <i>in situ</i> hybridization analysis, we demonstrate that the icv injection of NDN increases the ARC levels of <i>Pomc</i> mRNA without affecting <i>Agrp</i> or <i>Npy</i> mRNA levels, which suggests that ARC ACBD7<sub>89</sub>-producing neurons may directly activate POMC neurons. Additionally, using acute pharmacological blockade of the MC4R signalling pathway as well as the MC4R knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that the anorexigenic effects of NDN were relayed via the melanocortin system. Furthermore, experiments performed on mice hypothalamic explants revealed that NDN was able to increase the secretion of \u03b1-MSH, suggesting that NDN is able to activate POMC neurons in the ARC. In addition, we demonstrated that intra-MBH injections of NDN induce strong anorexigenic effects. Altogether, these results strongly support that ARC ACBD7<sub>89</sub>-producing neurons are involved in the hypothalamic regulation of food intake and energy expenditure by acting on POMC neurons through releasing NDN. However, the full mechanisms whereby NDN modulates the melanocortin system tone have yet to be fully deciphered. The involvement of the melanocortin system in the action of NDN recapitulates that seen with ODN. Previous investigations performed in rodents have indeed revealed the ability of ODN to increase <i>Pomc</i> mRNA level (<a href=\"#bib11\">Compere et al., 2003</a>) and the potential involvement of the MC4R receptor in the anorexigenic effect of the ODN (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lanfray et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "Because of the acknowledged role of the leptin - melanocortin association in energy homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goncalves et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">Hill et al., 2010</a>) and the involvement of the MC4R in the effects of NDN, we hypothesized that <i>Acdb7</i> neurons could be part of the leptin-melanocortin integrated pathway. In that respect, it is noteworthy that recent data indicated that leptin effects on the melanocortin system could be relayed through an uncharacterized class of ARC GABAergic cells diverging from POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balthasar et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">Hill et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">van de Wall et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">Vong et al., 2011</a>). Our results indicate that the icv injection of leptin led to an increase in the hypothalamic levels of both ACBD7 and NDN, supporting a connection between leptin and <i>Acdb7</i> neurons. In that context, we sought to determine the involvement of the endogenous NDN production as part of the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Investigations performed on <i>ad libitum</i> fed mice showed that the anorexigenic effect induced by an icv injection of leptin was partially blunted by the co-injection of the LV-1075, indicating that the hypothalamic activation of the EZ GPCR is part of the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Additionally, our investigation revealed that the anorexigenic effect of icv injection of leptin is totally abolished by the co-injection of HS024, confirming that the melanocortin signalling pathway constitutes a major relay in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balthasar et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, no additional effects were seen when LV-1075 and HS024 were co-injected, suggesting that NDN relayed the anorexigenic effect of leptin mainly through activating POMC neurons. Although, this result does not establish a direct link between NDN and leptin signalling, it nonetheless provides further evidence for such a link i.e. LV-1075 also blocked NDN anorectic action. It is noteworthy that the hypothalamic <i>Dbi/Acbp</i> mRNA level is unaffected by central injection of leptin (<a href=\"#bib10\">Compere et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that glial EZs (such as ODN) are not involved in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Moreover, our observations and speculations are in line with a recent report from the translating ribosome affinity purification analysis of hypothalamic LepR positive neurons, indicating that the <i>Acbd7</i> mRNA level is enriched by more than four times in hypothalamic neurons expressing the <i>Lepr</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allison et al., 2015</a>)."

Additionally, we observed that chronic pharmacological disruption of the EZ GPCR signalling induced a potent increase in both food intake and body weight, suggesting that the endogenous endozepines signalling pathway could be a part of the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis. Although, these results do not establish a direct link between endogenous production of NDN and the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis, they nonetheless provide further evidence for the involvement endozepines in this process. Additionally, it is noteworthy that single nucleotide polymorphism in both the DBI/ACBP and ACBD7 are linked with morbid obesity in humans (<a href=\"#bib12\">Comuzzie et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that these two genes are complementary involved in the hypothalamic regulation of energy balance."

The RNA concentrations were estimated from absorbance at 260 nm and cDNA synthesis was performed using the expand reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) on 1\u00a0\u00b5g of total mRNA. mRNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and cDNA was diluted in DNAse-free water (1:30) before quantification by real-time PCR. <i>Ucp1</i> and acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (<i>Arbp</i>) mRNA levels were measured in duplicate samples using a CFX96 touch real-time PCR (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, Canada, ON) by using primers specific to the murine <i>Ucp1</i> mRNA (<i>Ucp1</i>-FP: 3\u2019-GCAGTGTTCATTGGGCAGCC 5\u2019; <i>Ucp1</i>-RP: 3\u2019- GGACATCGCACAGCTTGGTAC-5\u2019) and to the <i>Arbp</i> mRNA (Arbp-FP: 3\u2019- AGAAACTGCTGCCTCACATC-5\u2019; <i>Arbp</i>-RP: 3\u2019- CATCACTCAGAATTTCAATGG-5\u2019). Chemical detection of the PCR products was achieved with SYBR Green I (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada, ON). At the end of each run, melt curve analyses were performed, and representative samples of each experimental group were run on agarose gel to ensure the specificity of the amplification. Fold differences in target mRNA expression were measured using the \u0394\u0394-cycle threshold method by comparison with the house-keeping gene and expressed as fold change between vehicle versus NDN icv-injected mice."

The anorexigenic effect of icv applied NDN relies on a yet uncharacterized GPCR, but not on GABA-R-signaling.

Reviewer #3: In their current contribution Lanfray et al. investigate the role of ACBD7 on energy homeostasis and feeding. They reveal transcriptional and translation control of ACBD7 in the hypothalamus dependening on feeding state, with a pronounced upregulation upon refeeding. ACBD7 appears to be primarily expressed in the ARC and PVN. They also demonstrate, that ACBD7 is cleaved to a NDN peptide, and that also NDN increases upon refeeding. Functionally, icv injection of NDN suppresses refeeding, increases energy expenditure and BAT UCP1-expression. The anorexigenic effect of icv applied NDN relies on a yet uncharacterized GPCR, but not on GABA-R-signaling. Finally, the anorexigenic effect of NDN is abrogated upon application of an MC4R-antagonist and leptin increases ACBD7-expression. Overall, the experiments appear well performed and support the conclusions drawn by the authors. The findings are novel and interesting. However, a few parts of the study present interesting findings, which are correlative, but not fully causally linked. Important questions, which should be addressed include. 1) What is the exact quantitative proportion of POMC-cells expressing ACBD7?</i> "
