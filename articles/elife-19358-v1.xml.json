In aged animals, a decrease in the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive impairments. Increasing activity of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in young adult rodents facilitates cognition, and increases intrinsic excitability. However, it has yet to be tested if increasing CREB expression also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits. To test this hypothesis, we virally overexpressed CREB in CA1 of dorsal hippocampus. Rats received CREB or control virus, before undergoing water maze training. CREB overexpression in aged animals ameliorated the long-term memory deficits observed in control animals. Concurrently, cells overexpressing CREB in aged animals had reduced post-burst afterhyperpolarizations, indicative of increased intrinsic excitability. These results identify CREB modulation as a potential therapy to treat age-related cognitive decline."

In aged animals, a decrease in the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive impairments. Increasing activity of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in young adult rodents facilitates cognition, and increases intrinsic excitability. However, it has yet to be tested if increasing CREB expression also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits. To test this hypothesis, we virally overexpressed CREB in CA1 of dorsal hippocampus. Rats received CREB or control virus, before undergoing water maze training. CREB overexpression in aged animals ameliorated the long-term memory deficits observed in control animals. Concurrently, cells overexpressing CREB in aged animals had reduced post-burst afterhyperpolarizations, indicative of increased intrinsic excitability. These results identify CREB modulation as a potential therapy to treat age-related cognitive decline."

One likely mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive deficits is a decrease in the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Numerous studies have revealed that CA1 pyramidal neurons from aged animals have reduced intrinsic excitability when compared to those from young animals. Specifically, pyramidal neurons from area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus of aged animals exhibit a larger post-burst afterhyperpolarization (AHP) than those from young animals (<a href=\"#bib17\">Disterhoft and Oh, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gant et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Landfield and Pitler, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Oh et al., 2013</a>). The magnitude of this age-related decrease in neuronal excitability correlates with age-related cognitive deficits (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tombaugh et al., 2005</a>). Aged impaired (AI) animals have larger AHPs than both young animals, and aged unimpaired (AU) animals. Interestingly, the AHP amplitude from AU animals is no different than that of young animals (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matthews et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Moyer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tombaugh et al., 2005</a>). Moreover, pharmacological compounds that reduce the amplitude of the AHP in vitro, ameliorate age-related cognitive impairments in vivo (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kronforst-Collins et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Moyer et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Oh et al., 1999</a>). Based on these findings, we are searching for molecular pathway(s) that modulate both cognition and intrinsic cellular excitability."

Numerous studies have manipulated CREB activation in young animals to demonstrate its essential role in memory formation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernabeu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bourtchuladze et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dash et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Deisseroth et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kaang et al., 1993</a>). Memories for spatial and cued information were impaired in transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative form of CREB (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pittenger et al., 2002</a>). Likewise, mutations which prevent CREB from being activated by inhibiting its phosphorylation also impaired memory (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kida et al., 2002</a>). Conversely, increases in CREB activity via transgenic or viral means facilitated memory. For instance, expressing a partially-active form of CREB (VP16-CREB) in the amygdala resulted in stronger memories for contextual and cued fear conditioning (<a href=\"#bib62\">Viosca et al., 2009b</a>). Likewise, infusion of HSV-CREB into hippocampus or amygdala, results in CREB overexpression and facilitation of memory for the Morris water maze (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sekeres et al., 2010</a>), water cross maze (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brightwell et al., 2007</a>), or fear conditioning (<a href=\"#bib30\">Josselyn et al., 2001</a>) in young animals."

Furthermore, the few published studies which have examined CREB levels in aging appear to present conflicting results. One study reported that levels of total CREB protein were unchanged with aging, however, levels of CREB phosphorylated at S133 (pCREB) decreased with age (<a href=\"#bib20\">Foster et al., 2001</a>). Another study reported a decrease in total CREB with aging, which was specifically observed in aged animals that had impairments in spatial memory (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brightwell et al., 2004</a>). A third study found that total CREB was unchanged, while pCREB increased with age (<a href=\"#bib41\">Monti et al., 2005</a>). While the exact nature of age-related CREB levels is unclear, these findings do suggest that CREB levels in the hippocampal formation change with age. Additionally, upstream activators of CREB, such as cAMP, have been found to be decreased with age (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bach et al., 1999</a>). Activation of protein kinase A, the next step in this activation cascade, is required for the learning-induced reduction in post-burst AHPs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Oh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>), and reduced in aged rats (<a href=\"#bib32\">Karege et al., 2001</a>). Calcineurin, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates CREB, has also been found to be increased with age (<a href=\"#bib20\">Foster et al., 2001</a>). All of these factors could result in a decrease in CREB activation, which led us to hypothesize that increasing CREB levels would ameliorate both the cognitive and biophysical deficits observed in normal aging subjects. We tested this hypothesis by using an adeno-associated viral vector to overexpress wild-type rat CREB in CA1 of dorsal hippocampus. Spatial learning and memory were then assessed using two different Morris water maze protocols; a less challenging version, and a more difficult version. Our results revealed that CREB overexpression in dorsal CA1 ameliorated age-related long-term biophysical and behavioral deficits."

Thus, we characterized the infection efficiency and the extent of CREB overexpression of our new adeno-associated viral vector. AAV-CREB virus with a GFP reporter (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was bilaterally injected into CA1 region of 5 young (3\u20134 months old, mo), and four aged (29\u201330 mo) male, Fischer 344XBrown Norway F1 hybrid rats. Two weeks after the viral injections, animals were transcardially perfused, and their brains post-fixed to make coronal sections (40 \u03bcm) for immunofluorescent staining. Three sections from each animal were stained for NeuN and GFP, to determine the percentage of neurons that were GFP-positive (GFP+): i.e., cells that had been infected by AAV-CREB virus. By visualizing the GFP signal, we observed widespread infection through the medial-lateral axis of CA1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), with approximately 2 mm of spread in the anterior-posterior axis. Over 95% of cells in this infected area were positive for GFP, and there was no difference in the percentage of GFP+ cells between young (95.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71%) and aged (96.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.83%) animals (t<sub>7</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.26, n.s.; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). To confirm that viral infection led to overexpression of CREB, another set of sections from the beginning of the infected area, with a lower infection rate to encompass sufficient number of GFP- cells, was stained for CREB and GFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). The average CREB intensity of GFP- neurons was set at 100%, and the CREB immunocytochemical signal from GFP+ neurons was normalized to that value. One sample t-tests against a hypothetical average of 100% revealed that GFP+ cells expressed more CREB than GFP- cells in both young (151.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.16%, t<sub>4</sub>\u00a0=\u00a09.97, p=0.0006) and aged (141.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.44%, t<sub>3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a011.91, p=0.0013) animals, and no differences were observed in CREB expression of GFP+ cells between young and aged animals (t<sub>7</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.59, n.s.; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Together, these data indicate that our AAV-CREB virus infects the same percentage of neurons and achieves the same amount of CREB overexpression in both young and aged animals."

A repeated measures ANOVA, with age and virus as the between groups measures, and session as the repeated measure, revealed significant main effects of session (F<sub>3, 42</sub> = 63.3, p&lt;0.0001) and of age (F<sub>1, 42</sub> = 14.72, p=0.0004), but not of virus (F<sub>1, 42</sub> = 0.14, n.s.). We observed that on the last session of hidden platform training, aged GFP animals tended have higher cumulative proximities than the other groups. We examined these differences on the last session with a two-way ANOVA, with age and virus as the between groups factors. This revealed a significant main effect of age (F<sub>1, 42</sub> = 9.70, p=0.003), but not of virus (F<sub>1,42</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.16, n.s.). Post-hoc comparisons (Tukey\u2019s) of cumulative proximity on the last day of training confirmed that aged GFP animals had greater cumulative proximities than both young GFP animals (p=0.031), and young CREB animals (p=0.023)."

Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test revealed that young animals spent significantly more time in the target quadrant compared to aged GFP (p=0.01), but not compared to aged CREB (n.s., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). When a D\u2019Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test was run, we found young and aged CREB data to have a Gaussian distribution, while aged GFP did not (young n.s, aged CREB n.s., aged GFP p=0.045). To determine if we had two groups within the aged GFP group, we separated the animals into two groups; AU and AI, using [young average - one standard deviation] as the cut off (grey dotted line, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). The two new aged GFP groups were each found to have Gaussian distributions (AU n.s., AI n.s.). Based upon these new behavioral groupings, we reanalyzed the day four probe data, and found a significant difference between the groups (one-way ANOVA: F<sub>3, 42</sub> = 23.78, p&lt;0.0001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>).

These results indicate that in aged animals, AAV-CREB injection ameliorated the long-term memory deficits seen in AAV-GFP animals, to the point where their performance was no different to that of young animals."

Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal neurons held near \u221269 mV. Specifically, the postburst AHP was measured following a train of 15 suprathreshold current injections. We compared three different groups of cells from young and aged animals; AAV-CREB infected cells (CREB+), their neighboring uninfected cells (CREB\u2212), and cells from AAV-GFP injected animals. Two-way ANOVAs with main factors of age and cell type revealed similar changes in both the peak and slow AHPs: significant effect of cell type (F<sub>2, 63</sub> &gt; 4, p\u2019s\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05), but not of age (F<sub>1, 63</sub> &lt; 1, n.s.)

Therefore, postburst AHP data for all young cells were combined into one group, and the postburst AHP data for aged CREB- and GFP cells were combined into one aged control group. Analyses revealed significant differences of the postburst AHP in the three groups of cells: one-way ANOVA for peak AHP, F<sub>2, 66</sub> = 6.22, p=0.003; for slow AHP F<sub>2, 66</sub> = 6.54, p=0.003 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d,e</a>).

Administration of AAV-CREB resulted in widespread infection of dorsal CA1 in young and aged rats, which specifically increased CREB mRNA levels in dorsal CA1. Importantly, this increase in CREB was sufficient to ameliorate age-related long-term spatial memory deficits. Furthermore, as predicted, aged pyramidal neurons infected by AAV-CREB had reduced post-burst AHPs, indicating that infected cells were more excitable. These data reaffirm that aging-related processes increase the AHP in CA1 neurons, and leads to decreased excitability that contributes to memory impairment. Increasing CREB levels is sufficient to reverse these processes and normalize memory function. Our data is clear, and is consistent with some previously reported work. However, it is at odds with other reports, and we suspect that a number of different experimental variables contribute to this inconsistency in the literature."

Nearly all aged CREB animals, and a subset of aged GFP rats were able to learn and remember both the less challenging, and more difficult task at young-like levels. These results are consistent with those of earlier studies, indicating that approximately half of aged rats are impaired on this task (<a href=\"#bib16\">Disterhoft and Oh, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gallagher et al., 1993</a>). With that said, our aged control animals could be separated into those with impaired long-term spatial memory, and those without impaired long-term spatial memory, whereas aged animals receiving AAV-CREB were much more homogenous, consistently performing at, or near, young-like levels. We found water maze performance by our young and, presumably AU animals were not improved with AAV-CREB, which is supported by results of a prior study which revealed that viral administration of CREB-Y134F improved fear memory in young \u2018poor learners\u2019, with no improvement in young \u2018good-learners\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cowansage et al., 2013</a>). These findings are also supported by a study by <a href=\"#bib8\">Brightwell et al. (2004)</a>, which found that AI animals trained on water maze had lower levels of CREB protein than young animals and AU animals (2004). Together, these previous findings and our present results suggest that lower levels of CREB protein in AI animals contributes to their cognitive deficits, and increasing CREB in these animals can rescue their behavioral deficits. This rescue by CREB overexpression was most likely mediated by increased levels of pCREB. Despite reports of decreased CREB activation with aging, via increases in calcineurin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Foster et al., 2001</a>) and decreases in PKA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Karege et al., 2001</a>), we hypothesize that increasing the absolute levels of their substrate, CREB, would lead to an increase in the levels of pCREB and CREB activity. However, the detailed mechanistic relationship between the levels of CREB, pCREB, and CREB activity is unlikely to be straight forward (<a href=\"#bib7\">Briand et al., 2015</a>)."

We found that CREB overexpression increased the intrinsic excitability of aged CA1 neurons. The AHPs from AAV-CREB infected neurons were reduced when compared to neighboring uninfected cells, or GFP-injected controls, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yiu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). These results mirror those from studies using pharmacological methods where treatment that reduced the AHP also facilitated cognitive performance in aged animals (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deyo et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kronforst-Collins et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Moyer et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Oh et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Weible et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, we found that CREB overexpression had no observable effect on the size of AHPs in young neurons. Previous studies using partially-active CREB-Y134F or VP16-CREB have demonstrated their ability to facilitate long-term potentiation and reduce the AHP in cells from young animals (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lopez de Armentia et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Suzuki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yu et al., 2016</a>). The increase in downstream transcription is likely to be much greater when a partially activated form of CREB, as opposed to wild-type, is used. This may in part explain why we did not see any effect of virus on AHP amplitude in cells from young animals."

Studies using CREB overexpression in young animals have produced mixed results. <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhou et al. (2009)</a> used HSV-CREB to overexpress CREB in amygdala of mice, which resulted in a smaller AHP amplitude when measured 300 ms after the final action potential, as compared to neighboring control cells. Peak AHP was not found to be different (2009). Another study transfected primary mice hippocampal neurons to overexpress CREB and found that transfected cells had increased excitability (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yiu et al., 2014</a>). Lastly, when HSV-CREB was injected into locus coeruleus of rats, excitability was unchanged, as compared to rats injected with control virus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Han et al., 2006</a>). These varying results may be due to differences in slice vs. cultured neurons, mouse vs. rat tissue, or even due to differing brain regions, but we suspect that the \u2018excitability state\u2019 of the animals is a major uncontrolled determinant. In our hands, CREB overexpression was not sufficient to cause any differences in peak or slow AHP amplitude in CA1 neurons from young animals. Although we saw similar levels of CREB overexpression in both age groups, only the aged animals exhibited a change at the biophysical level. It is possible that while the young animals are already at an \u2018optimal state\u2019, and have sufficient excitability or plasticity for learning and memory, the aged animals are in a \u2018sub-optimal state\u2019, and therefore have room for improvement. This effect has been demonstrated before, where systemic application of L-type calcium channel blocker nimodipine (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deyo et al., 1989</a>) or cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (<a href=\"#bib63\">Weible et al., 2004</a>) was beneficial for aged animals, but had no effect on young. Similarly, exposure to environmental enrichment, which can indirectly lead to increased CREB activation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hu et al., 2013</a>), reduced the AHP in neurons from aged animals, but not young (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kumar and Foster, 2007</a>). For potential therapeutic purposes, this may be a desirable trait, so as to only affect those who have room for improvement."

We have demonstrated that viral overexpression of CREB was achieved in these young animals, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of wild-type rat CREB, as opposed to a mutated form of CREB, may partly explain the lack of behavioral effect. Expression of VP16-CREB in young animals has led to transient facilitation of eye-blink conditioning (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gruart et al., 2012</a>), as well as facilitation of memory for contextual and cued fear (<a href=\"#bib61\">Viosca et al., 2009a</a>). Additionally, expression of a CREB-Y134F in young animals has given enhanced memory for both fear conditioning and water maze (<a href=\"#bib54\">Restivo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Suzuki et al., 2011</a>). These studies suggest that the increase in CREB expression we observed with our AAV-CREB was not sufficient (when compared to that achieved by mutated forms of CREB) to facilitate the behavioral performance of young animals. However, some studies have shown facilitation of fear conditioning as a result of HSV overexpression of wild-type CREB in the amygdala (<a href=\"#bib30\">Josselyn et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sekeres et al., 2010</a>). In these studies, animals underwent weak training, where control animals failed to form a memory, but animals overexpressing CREB were able to do so. In the current study, we initially used a less challenging version of the water maze task, and delivered 4 sessions of training with five trials per session. We suspected this \u2018strong\u2019 training may have produced a ceiling effect in our young animals, where increasing CREB activity could not lead to further improvements. Thus, we injected a new group of animals with AAV-GFP and AAV-CREB, and trained them on a more difficult version of the task, to determine if young CREB animals\u2019 performance would then be facilitated. The difficult version did prove more challenging, with both young and aged animals taking longer to learn the task, and spending less time in the target quadrant across probe trials as compared to the less challenging version. Interestingly, the pattern of behavioral results was very similar to that observed during the less challenging task: CREB mediated rescue in aged rats, but had no effect in young rats. This suggests that the difference between the viral overexpression of HSV and AAV may be at play. HSV is known to give strong, but transient gene expression, while AAV tends to provide more subtle, but stable expression over long periods of time (<a href=\"#bib46\">Neve et al., 2005</a>). These data indicate that strong CREB overexpression, such as in the case of HSV, or a mutant form of CREB is required to achieve behavioral facilitation in young adult animals, given that they are already at an \u2018optimal learning state\u2019."

While this is an important observation, given the lack of relationship between CA1 CREB mRNA levels and behavior, our focus continues to be on the CA1 sub-region. We chose to target this sub-region of the hippocampus as it has exhibited biophysical deficits with age (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bach et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Disterhoft and Oh, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tombaugh et al., 2005</a>).

One of these is successful learning of a behavioral task, where animals that learn exhibit smaller AHPs than those who do not (<a href=\"#bib48\">Oh and Disterhoft, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Moyer et al., 1996</a>). However, the learning-related reduction in postburst AHP is transient, and AHP amplitudes return to baseline within two weeks after the end of behavioral training (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moyer et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thompson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tombaugh et al., 2005</a>). All biophysical recordings in this study were made between two to three weeks after the end of behavioral testing in order to measure the baseline AHP, and to avoid any learning-induced changes in the AHP. However, this still raises the question of how CREB overexpression resulted in the reduction of the AHP. CREB may modulate the AHP by indirectly influencing the levels or activity of AHP channels via one or more of CREB\u2019s downstream transcriptional targets. Alternatively, it is possible that CREB could act on AHP channels via a previously unknown non-transcriptional mechanism. Elucidating this mechanism would be of great interest. Despite not fully understanding the mechanisms involved, the consequences of CREB\u2019s enhancement of neuronal excitability have been examined. Neurons that have increased CREB activity become more excitable (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lopez de Armentia et al., 2007</a>), and are then preferentially recruited to form new memories (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yiu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>)."

Previous studies have shown increases in calcineurin with aging (<a href=\"#bib20\">Foster et al., 2001</a>), decreases in PKA, (<a href=\"#bib20\">Foster et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Karege et al., 2001</a>), and AI animals have been shown to have reduced CREB protein (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brightwell et al., 2004</a>). All of these could result in decreases in CREB function, but only one study has manipulated CREB levels with aging. <a href=\"#bib42\">Mouravlev et al. (2006)</a> did a longitudinal study revealing that overexpressing wild-type CREB in young rats prevents age-related cognitive deficits from arising later in life. However, it was still unclear whether CREB would be able to reverse the age-related deficits after they arose. In our present study, CREB overexpression alone was sufficient to rescue the long-term memory deficits in aged animals. We hypothesize that CREB\u2019s effects on behavioral performance may have been via the normalization of the previously reported deficits in CREB activity/function. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that CREB protein levels strongly correlate with performance on probe 4, where aged animals with the lowest levels of CREB protein performed the worst. This suggests that aged animals with low CREB protein levels are more likely to be AI. On the other hand, aged animals with high CREB protein levels, either naturally or due to AAV-CREB infusions, are more likely to perform at young-like levels. Alternatively, it is also possible that CREB overexpression may have compensated for age-related deficits via other mechanisms. Possibilities include CREB\u2019s ability to modulate synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benito and Barco, 2010</a>), and to induce preferential recruitment of neurons to form a new memory via increasing intrinsic excitability (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yiu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>)."

A recent study has also shown that Tau accumulation reduces CREB activity by increasing calcineurin levels (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yin et al., 2016</a>). Together, these results suggest that impaired, or sub-optimal CREB function in aging may make aged individuals more vulnerable to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Furthermore, this indicates that CREB may not only be targeted for amelioration of cognitive deficits seen in normal aging, it could also be an important pharmacological target in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease."

Each trial began by placing the animal in the centre of one of the three quadrants that did not contain the hidden platform. Each animal was allowed 60 s to locate the escape platform. If the animal did not swim to the hidden platform after 60 s, the experimenter gently guided the animal to the platform. Upon reaching the platform, animals remained on the platform for a further 15 s, before being removed by the experimenter. The animals\u2019 cumulative proximity to the platform was measured for each training trial, then the average cumulative proximity was calculated for each animal for each of the 4 days of training. We chose to use the cumulative proximity measurement as it has been shown to be sensitive to age-related cognitive impairments (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gallagher et al., 1993</a>)."

Throughout the manuscript, the language used to imply that the results were due to CREB activity should be modified to indicate that the results were due to increased expression. For example: However, it has yet to be tested if \"increasing CREB activity also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits\". This sentence should be altered. A review of the literature suggests that there is considerable support for the idea that induction of CREB activity (the level of pCREB) regulates memory in aged animals. Other examples include: Genoux et al., 2002; Porte et al., 2007; Countryman and Gold, 2007). The authors do not have to include these other references, but the point is that there is considerable evidence that learning induced pCREB or increasing pCREB during learning in aged animals improves memory and it has yet to be tested if \"increasing CREB expression in aged animals will also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits\"."

In discussing the idea that increased CREB expression influenced the AHP, the authors should consider the possibility that the change in the AHP is an epiphenomena due to CREB effects on behavior, rather than a direct effect of CREB expression. This point could be related to the work of the authors and others, which indicate that a decrease in the AHP is observed for young and aged animals that learn/remember on hippocampal-dependent tasks. The authors' data indicate a lack of effect of CREB on the AHP of young animals. Is it possible that the lack of effect on the AHP of young animals is due to the possibility that young animals were able to learn/remember on the hippocampal-dependent task regardless of CREB expression?"

On the contrary, according to molecular analyses performed in the present study, there is, under control conditions, an age-related reduction in CREB mRNA levels in the DG (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) but not in the CA1 area (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The reviewer was surprised to find no mention of these negative findings neither in the Results section nor in the Discussion. The lack of evidence for any age-related change in local CREB expression (or activity) has important implications for interpreting the positive effects of overexpressing CREB in the aged CA1. If CREB expression is not altered by aging, present rescue of age-related defects in memory and cellular excitability cannot reflect normalization of CREB activity/function, but might rather be due to the fact that overexpressing CREB can compensate for age-related changes in alternative cellular pathways. In that sense, the present study fails to elucidate critical molecular mechanisms involved in the age-related cognitive decline, and does not identify CREB as a key player. As one possible attempt to improve the paper and provide more convincing support to the authors' conclusion, it was suggested that the authors reanalyze molecular data presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3 (A, B, C</a>) by dividing the Aged control group (N=17) into two subgroups: Aged Impaired and Aged Unimpaired (according to the performance in the Probe Trial performed 4 days after the last session of acquisition in the Morris water maze, i.e. just as done previously for behavioral analyzes in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). If a difference in CREB mRNA levels was to be found between the two aged groups (AI &lt; AU), I would not disagree any longer with the conclusion on CREB being a key player in cognitive aging."

The new data showed that in fact young animals were still not impacted by AAV-CREB, even on the more difficult version of the task, which removes the possibility of a ceiling effect causing the lack of facilitation. These results do not concur with studies showing facilitated behavioral performance in young animals using HSV virus, or mutant forms of CREB. We believe that the differing results can predominantly be attributed to the nature of the gene expression achieved by HSV vs. AAV. HSV tends to give expression that is short lasting and strong, while AAV is more subtle and stable. Given young animals are already in an \u201coptimal state\u201d we believe that stronger CREB overexpression, such as that achieved by HSV, or a mutant form of CREB is required to facilitate young behavior. This is discussed in the revised Discussion."

For example: However, it has yet to be tested if \"increasing CREB activity also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits\". This sentence should be altered. A review of the literature suggests that there is considerable support for the idea that induction of CREB activity (the level of pCREB) regulates memory in aged animals. Other examples include: Genoux et al., 2002; Porte et al., 2007; Countryman and Gold, 2007). The authors do not have to include these other references, but the point is that there is considerable evidence that learning induced pCREB or increasing pCREB during learning in aged animals improves memory and it has yet to be tested if \"increasing CREB expression in aged animals will also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits\".</i>"

In discussing the idea that increased CREB expression influenced the AHP, the authors should consider the possibility that the change in the AHP is an epiphenomena due to CREB effects on behavior, rather than a direct effect of CREB expression. This point could be related to the work of the authors and others, which indicate that a decrease in the AHP is observed for young and aged animals that learn/remember on hippocampal-dependent tasks. The authors' data indicate a lack of effect of CREB on the AHP of young animals.

While it is not currently understood how CREB might directly affect the AHP, we have now added our thoughts on the possible mechanisms at play. Importantly, we do not believe our observed effects on the AHP are driven by the animals\u2019 behavioral performance, due to the time point at which we measured the AHP; 2-3 weeks after the last behavioral test. Previous biophysical studies have shown that learning-induced changes to the AHP return to baseline two weeks after the end of behavioral testing (Moyer et al., 1996; Thompson et al., 1996; Tombaugh et al., 2005). Furthermore, previously published studies in young animals indicate that increasing CREB activation or CREB overexpression reduces AHP size in neurons (Lopez de Armentia et al., 2007), which in turn makes those neurons more likely to be a part of a new memory engram (Han et al., 2007, Zhou et al. 2009, Yiu et al. 2014). Therefore, we believe that the observed behavioral facilitation was a result of the AHP size, rather the than other way around."

On the contrary, according to molecular analyses performed in the present study, there is, under control conditions, an age-related reduction in CREB mRNA levels in the DG (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) but not in the CA1 area (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The reviewer was surprised to find no mention of these negative findings neither in the Results section nor in the Discussion. The lack of evidence for any age-related change in local CREB expression (or activity) has important implications for interpreting the positive effects of overexpressing CREB in the aged CA1. If CREB expression is not altered by aging, present rescue of age-related defects in memory and cellular excitability cannot reflect normalization of CREB activity/function, but might rather be due to the fact that overexpressing CREB can compensate for age-related changes in alternative cellular pathways. In that sense, the present study fails to elucidate critical molecular mechanisms involved in the age-related cognitive decline, and does not identify CREB as a key player. As one possible attempt to improve the paper and provide more convincing support to the authors' conclusion, it was suggested that the authors reanalyze molecular data presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3 (A, B, C</a>) by dividing the Aged control group (N=17) into two subgroups: Aged Impaired and Aged Unimpaired (according to the performance in the Probe Trial performed 4 days after the last session of acquisition in the Morris water maze, i.e. just as done previously for behavioral analyzes in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). If a difference in CREB mRNA levels was to be found between the two aged groups (AI &lt; AU), I would not disagree any longer with the conclusion on CREB being a key player in cognitive aging.</i>"

We reanalyzed the molecular data of the aged control animals as suggested, but did not find a difference in CREB mRNA levels between AI and AU animals (new <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that CREB mRNA levels are not related to behavioral performance. However, numerous studies have shown CREB protein levels/activation to be impaired with aging (Foster et al., 2001, Karege et al., 2001), more specifically, AI rats have less CREB protein than AU (Brightwell et al., 2004). Together, our present CREB mRNA results and previous CREB protein reports suggest that while CREB function is impaired at the protein level, CREB mRNA levels are not a biomarker of behavioral performance. Therefore, we also carried out western blots on previously frozen tissue from the aged GFP animals trained on the less challenging water maze protocol. Unlike previous reports on CREB protein, which either measured levels from na\u00efve animals, or from trained animals shortly after training, we measured basal levels of CREB protein (2-3 weeks after the behavioral testing was completed). At this time point, we show that an animals\u2019 basal levels of CREB protein is highly predictive of their behavioral performance \u2013 in this case on probe 4 (new <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Given this evidence from our new results and previous studies from others, we believe it is very likely our behavioral results were due to a normalization of impaired CREB function. However, as the reviewers correctly pointed out, we have not ruled out the possibility that CREB overexpression led to biophysical and behavioral benefits via other means. These points of discussion have now been included in the revised manuscript (Discussion, last two paragraphs)."
