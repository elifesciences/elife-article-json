Here we performed TSS mapping of the translatome following energy stress. Assessing the contribution of cap-proximal TSS nucleotides, we found dramatic effect on translation only upon stress. As eIF4E levels were reduced, we determined its binding to capped-RNAs with different initiating nucleotides and found the lowest affinity to 5'cytidine in correlation with the translational stress-response. In addition, the number of differentially translated APs was elevated following stress. These include novel glucose starvation-induced downstream transcripts for the translation regulators eIF4A and Pabp, which are also translationally-induced despite general translational inhibition. The resultant eIF4A protein is N-terminally truncated and acts as eIF4A inhibitor. The induced Pabp isoform has shorter 5'UTR removing an auto-inhibitory element. Our findings uncovered several levels of coordination of transcription and translation responses to energy stress."

Here we performed TSS mapping of the translatome following energy stress. Assessing the contribution of cap-proximal TSS nucleotides, we found dramatic effect on translation only upon stress. As eIF4E levels were reduced, we determined its binding to capped-RNAs with different initiating nucleotides and found the lowest affinity to 5'cytidine in correlation with the translational stress-response. In addition, the number of differentially translated APs was elevated following stress. These include novel glucose starvation-induced downstream transcripts for the translation regulators eIF4A and Pabp, which are also translationally-induced despite general translational inhibition. The resultant eIF4A protein is N-terminally truncated and acts as eIF4A inhibitor. The induced Pabp isoform has shorter 5'UTR removing an auto-inhibitory element. Our findings uncovered several levels of coordination of transcription and translation responses to energy stress."

For example the level of transcription initiation can vary between different transcription start sites (TSS) under different growth conditions, in response to a specific signal or in different cell types and tissues. In addition, mRNA isoforms with different 5\u2019 leaders can vary in their translation efficiency or their half-lives. Likewise, AP usage can lead to the generation of protein isoforms that differ in their N-termini and as a result have different or even opposite biological functions. Recent large-scale promoter analysis in hundreds of human and mouse primary cell types shed light on the prevalence of AP usage in mammals (<a href=\"#bib12\">Forrest et al., 2014</a>). Several studies have examined translation and stability of transcript isoforms of the same gene (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Floor and Doudna, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2016</a>) but little is known about the contribution of AP usage to the translational response to stress."

Downregulation of the translation machinery is a major mechanism that allows cells to preserve energy and cope with environmental deficiencies. Under these conditions translation of many mRNAs is inhibited but that of others is unchanged or even enhanced in order to survive the stress. The translation inhibition response is mediated by several mechanisms, in particular by the impairment of key initiation factors eIF2 and eIF4E (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>). Stresses such as growth factor, energy and amino acid deficiencies affect the formation of the cap binding complex eIF4F, comprising of the initiation factors eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A. Under these conditions, eIF4E-Binding Proteins (4EBPs) which bind eIF4E with high affinity and interfere with its binding to eIF4G, is activated by dephosphorylation resulting in inhibition of cap-dependent translation. 4EBP is controlled by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein kinase that phosphorylates and diminishes its ability to bind eIF4E. Under circumstances of limited nutrients or other stresses mTOR activity is inhibited, 4EBP activity is enhanced and cap-dependent translation is suppressed (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>). The effect of the suppression of the general translation initiation factors under stress appears to vary from gene to gene, and is dictated by specific regulatory elements present in the mRNAs. A well-characterized mRNA feature associated with strong translational inhibition is the TOP element (5\u2019 Terminal Oligo Pyrimidine), an uninterrupted stretch of 4\u201315 pyrimidines, starting with cytidine at the most 5\u2019end of the mRNA (for a review see <a href=\"#bib24\">Meyuhas and Kahan [2015]</a>). A large fraction of TOP mRNAs code for proteins that are associated with translation and they are strongly translationally repressed following various physiological stresses that inhibit mTOR signaling by a mechanism that is not fully understood. It is thought that specific factors that bind the 5\u2019 polypyrimidine track mediate the positive and negative translation regulation of the TOP mRNAs. While several features of cellular mRNAs involved in specific translational response to metabolic stress were characterized, the impact of specific TSS usage on the cellular response to stress is poorly investigated."

To this end, we combined polysomal profiling with quantitative assessment of the 5\u2019 ends of mRNAs. By comparing transcript isoforms that differ in their 5\u2019 end we identified hundreds of genes with APs that are differentially translated, in particular following energy stress, suggesting that a major determinant of the differential response is associated with transcription-induced APs. We also determined the contribution of TSS nucleotides to translation. Strikingly, while the cap-proximal nucleotides have no significant effect on translation under optimal growth conditions, they display dramatic effects on the translational response to stress. We demonstrate that eIF4E levels drop following the stress and that the binding affinity of eIF4E towards capped mRNA with different first nucleotide varies significantly, with a\u00a0relatively lower affinity to 5\u2019 polypyrimidine as in TOP mRNAs. We next characterized two genes encoding translation regulatory factors with differentially translated APs. The first is eIF4A, the helicase subunit of the cap complex eIF4F, in which we identified a novel glucose-starvation-induced intronic promoter. The induced isoform, which has distinct 5\u2019UTR and initiating AUG, is efficiently translated in energy deficient cells in spite of the global translation inhibition. The resultant protein is N-terminally truncated and acts as an eIF4A inhibitor, most likely to facilitate the stress response. The second is poly-A binding protein (Pabp, Pabpc1) in which repression of the major TOP-containing isoform following stress is coupled with the\u00a0induction of a downstream TSS that generates an mRNA isoform with a much shorter 5\u2019UTR that is highly translated. Interestingly, the induced isoform lacks the well-characterized Pabp auto-inhibitory element (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sachs et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bag and Wu, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wu and Bag, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hornstein et al., 1999</a>).

Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) were subjected to glucose deprivation, a stress that causes inhibition of global translation at the initiation and elongation levels mediated by signaling pathways that are AMPK-dependent (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bolster et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dubbelhuis and Meijer, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Krause et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Reiter et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shenton et al., 2006</a>) and independent (<a href=\"#bib18\">Inoki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kalender et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sinvani et al., 2015</a>). Cells were then lysed and subjected to sucrose gradient sedimentation. As expected, the ribosome profile in response to glucose starvation (GS) was dramatically changed as the relative amount of 80S monoribosome was increased while polysomal fractions were decreased (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating global inhibition of translation. The fractions from the gradient were merged to create three major pools: Polysome-free, from the top of the gradient to a single ribosome; Light, two to five ribosomes per mRNA; and Heavy, six or more ribosomes per mRNA. RNA was extracted from the pooled fractions and equivalent RNA volume was taken from each fraction for transcription start site library preparation. At this stage, two RNA spikes, GFP and Luciferase (transcribed and capped in vitro) were added into each fraction pool, to serve as controls for sample handling. For TSSs sequencing, we used the CapSeq method as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gu et al., 2012</a>). In this method an adaptor is added only to the cap site of the mRNA and is used for deep sequencing. Thus the sequence information reports on the 5\u2019 end usage of transcripts within the polysomal profile. Samples from two independent biological replicates were subjected to Illumina sequencing. The 5\u2019 ends of mapped reads predominantly corresponded to annotated and CAGE-defined transcription start sites, showing that our methodology provides quantitative single-base resolution view of the TSS landscape (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Under these thresholds, three quarters of the genes had a single expressed promoter in these cells and the rest had two or more (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To validate that the TSS reads are in accordance with the expected biological outcome we first analyzed the global translational and transcriptional response to GS. We summed all the reads from each fraction for all the promoters and found that the overall translation was reduced upon GS as evident from the increase and decrease of the polysome-free (Free) and polysomal fractions (Heavy), respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), consistent with the polysomal profile (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The overall mRNA levels were reduced by\u00a0~15% after the treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), which most likely reflect the coupling between translation and mRNA stability (<a href=\"#bib32\">Radhakrishnan and Green, 2016</a>). Next, we quantified the translational response of the TOP mRNAs (CYYYY sequence is in the promoter summit), since these genes are known to be particularly sensitive to stresses. As expected, TOP mRNAs were preferentially inhibited upon GS on the translational level (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) while the changes of the mRNA levels were comparable with those of other mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

When the same analysis was performed following GS, 672 pairs of promoters from 465 genes displayed RO difference of two-fold or more, resulting in 42% increase in differential translation of APs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Interestingly 70% of these differentially translated pairs do not overlap with those in basal conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). These findings suggest that the increase in differential translation of transcript isoforms is part of the cellular stress response."

To determine the effect of the initiating nucleotides on translation efficiency we first analyzed all the non-redundant TSS positions in our data. We found that in MEFs, under basal and GS conditions,\u00a0~34% of TSSs initiated with adenosine (A),\u00a0~23% with cytidine (C),\u00a0~30% with guanosine (G) and\u00a0~13% with thymidine (T) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), similar to previous reports (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carninci et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yamashita et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Forrest et al., 2014</a>). Under basal conditions no significant difference was found in the RO of transcripts that vary in their first nucleotide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In contrast, the identity of the first base was correlated with significant differences in the response to GS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The RO of transcripts initiating with pyrimidines (C and U) was significantly reduced while those initiating with purines (A and G) appeared refractory to the stress. We performed the same analysis for initiating trinucleotides and found that under basal conditions, the RO of most trinucleotides is similar (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Notable exceptions are UGA, UGC, UGG and UGU that display higher RO and the pyrimidine-rich trinucleotides CCT, CTC, CTT, that correspond to somewhat lower RO (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The latter trinucleotides are most likely part of the TOP (CYYYY) element that was shown to confer slightly reduced translation even under optimal growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Patursky-Polischuk et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly following GS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) the majority the trinucleotides with initiating pyrimidines showed reduced translation, while those with purines were largely unaffected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Among the inhibitory trinucleotides were those that are part of the TOP element such as CCT and CTT, but also others that deviate from the TOP such as CAA, CAT, CTG, TAC etc."

Most previous studies of eIF4E binding affinity used cap analogs such as m7GTP or m7GpppG and reported Kd values ranging from low \u03bcM to few nM (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ueda et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carberry et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Minich et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sha et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hagedorn et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Miyoshi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wieczorek et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hsu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">von Der Haar et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Niedzwiecka et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Scheper et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ghosh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Thillier et al., 2012</a>). We chemically synthesized three capped RNA oligos as previously described (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lavergne et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Thillier et al., 2012</a>), 10 nt long each that differ in their first nucleotide. Human eIF4E was expressed as His-tag fusion in E. coli and purified from the soluble fraction by nickel agarose beads and subsequent gel filtration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Using the purified eIF4E we performed intrinsic fluorescence intensity measurements in the presence of increasing concentrations of either m7GpppG cap analog or the capped RNA oligos whose first nucleotide is C, A or G. The titration data of the RNA oligos and the cap analog are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>. The measured Kd for the m7GpppG was 561 nM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Interestingly, under the same conditions, the Kd of all capped RNA oligos was substantially lower, indicating that the RNA moiety increases the binding affinity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Furthermore, significant differences in the Kd values between the RNA oligos were observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>,\u00a0p-values are shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The oligo with polypyrimidine CCU as initiating nucleotides display lower affinity compared to oligos with ACU and GCU as first nucleotides. These Kd values of the mRNAs are correlated with the data of the relationship of the first nucleotides and the RO response to GS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These findings suggest that eIF4E binding affinity contributes to the level of translation, in particular when its intracellular concentrations become limiting as in GS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). To gain further support to this idea we downregulated the levels of eIF4E using siRNA and introduced into these cells GFP reporter genes driven either by Rpl18 or CMV promoters that direct transcription start site at a C (this study) or an A (<a href=\"#bib8\">Elfakess and Dikstein, 2008</a>) nucleotide, respectively. Both, the C and the A initiated transcripts were downregulated but the effect is substantially more pronounced for the C-initiated transcript (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We also analyzed these GFP reporter genes in cells treated with low concentrations of 4EGI-1, a drug that inhibits eIF4E by disrupting its interaction with eIF4G1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moerke et al., 2007</a>). Here again the C-initiating transcript was much more vulnerable to this drug compared to the A-initiated one (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), consistent with the notion that a C as an initiating nucleotide is highly responsive to fluctuations in eIF4E availability."

The global inhibition of translation in response to stress is mediated by the 5\u2019TOP element that is present in almost all ribosome subunits and many of the translation initiation factors. An exception is eIF4A, the helicase subunit of eIF4F. As seen in the mapped CapSeq reads (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), four promoters (p1, p2, p3 and p5) account for most of eIF4A mRNAs. p1 and p2 are positioned upstream of the annotated eIF4A protein start codon and in basal conditions these are the major promoters producing highly transcribed and efficiently translated mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and C</a>). On the other hand, p3 and p5 promoters are intronic and positioned downstream of the annotated protein start codon so that transcription from these promoters generates isoforms with different 5\u2019UTRs and an alternative truncated N-terminus. Upon GS p1 and p2 translation was slightly reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), whereas the intronic p3 and p5 promoters were significantly upregulated transcriptionally and translationally (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and C</a>). While p3 and p5 constitute a small fraction of the overall eIF4A under basal conditions, they account for more than half of eIF4A transcripts upon GS."

The putative 5\u2019UTR of the intronic isoform contains multiple AUGs possibly generating short upstream ORFs. To gain insight into the translation initiation site of the induced protein isoform we analyzed eIF4A protein using C-terminus specific antibody. We observed an energy-stress induced polypeptide of 33 kDa that is\u00a0~13 kDa shorter than the main protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). This truncated protein can be synthesized either from Met 121 or Met 127 of the main ORF. We used a GFP reporter that is preceded by the entire novel eIF4A 5\u2019UTR starting from p3 up to Met121. This construct drove the expression of a single polypeptide corresponding to translation initiation at Met121, which was also induced following GS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). To examine the function of this truncated protein we constructed an eIF4A expression plasmid lacking the first 120 amino acids (eIF4A\u0394N). This truncation is expected to impair the helicase activity of eIF4A but to retain its interaction with eIF4G1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dominguez et al., 2001</a>). Cells were transfected with either full-length (WT) or N-terminally truncated eIF4A together with a GFP reporter gene preceded by a 5\u2019UTR bearing a cap-proximal secondary structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). While the WT eIF4A has no effect on GFP expression, eIF4A\u0394N inhibited GFP protein levels in a dose dependent manner, indicating that eIF4A\u0394N acts as an inhibitor of eIF4A. Thus AP usage in eIF4A diminishes its activity following GS, reminiscent of the down regulation of other initiation factors following stress."

                                "text": "Poly(A) binding protein (Pabp), a central translation initiation regulatory factor, has several annotated promoters. The major promoter under basal conditions is p1, which generates a TOP mRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This mRNA isoform is expressed 40-folds higher than the next most transcribed isoform, driven by promoter p2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). After GS, p1 mRNA levels and translation were both strongly reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>), while p2 transcription was elevated by eight-fold (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and the vast majority of p2 transcripts were heavily translated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, right). In Pabp, both p1 and p2 are positioned upstream of the annotated protein start codon, hence the differential regulation of the APs upon GS changes solely the 5\u2019UTR length (from 467 nt to just 63 nt). Interestingly, it was previously reported by several groups that the 5\u2019UTR of the Pabp major isoform consists of conserved A-rich sequences (ARSs) which serve as binding sites of Pabp, resulting in translational repression (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bag and Wu, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hornstein et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kini et al., 2016</a>). These ARSs are missing in the shorter GS-induced mRNA isoform. Using 5\u2019RACE we validated the induction of p2 mRNA isoform upon GS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and the differential translational response of p1 and p2 to GS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Analysis of Pabp protein levels revealed that despite the strong translational inhibition of the primary isoform its protein levels remained stable, suggesting that the highly translated GS-induced transcript isoform compensates for the diminished translation of transcripts produced from p1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Pabp plays an important role in translation by promoting RNA circularization mediated by interaction with the cap complex eIF4F (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wells et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kaye et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yanagiya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2011</a>). However, tight control of Pabp levels is critical as excess of Pabp is inhibitory for translation in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yanagiya et al., 2010</a>). As eIF4F activity and the overall mRNA levels (dictating the overall abundance of poly-A tails) are downregulated in response to GS, the stoichiometry of Pabp relative to eIF4F and to the mRNA poly-A tails is elevated upon the stress and thus contributes to translation inhibition."

                        "text": "In the present study, we provide a global view and mechanistic insights of the impact of TSS selection on translation following metabolic energy stress. Our findings uncover the critical importance of the exact TSS/cap-proximal nucleotides in the translational response to energy stress. In basal condition, the initiating nucleotides have no significant effect while the 5\u2019UTR length appears to be an important determinant that governs the differential translation efficiency of transcript isoforms, with longer 5\u2019UTRs diminishing translation efficiency. The exact opposite is seen during energy stress, as the effect of 5\u2019UTR length was insignificant while the initiating nucleotides appear to be responsible, at least in part, for the difference in the RO effect. This phenomenon was clearly evident from cases in which adjacent nucleotides from the same promoter display dramatic differences in the translational response to the stress. In these instances the 5\u2019UTR length and sequence are almost identical. The differential sensitivity to the stress is particularly apparent between the purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. Although the first nucleotide contributed greatly to this differential effect, the following nucleotides are also important. The nucleotides that confer inhibition of translation following the stress start in most cases with cytidine, as does the TOP element. Intriguingly, the following nucleotides in GS-repressed trinucleotides do not always follow the TOP consensus of uninterrupted stretch of pyrimidines. Starting purines seem to confer greater resistance to the inhibition of translation. While the reporter gene assays clearly show the importance of the first nucleotide and isoforms generated from AP for differential translation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E, F</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5G</a>), it is possible that other features in endogenous transcripts may contribute to translation. Furthermore eIF4G1 and eIF4A, the partners of eIF4E in eIF4F, may also contribute to the differential affinity via their RNA binding domains. Thus, our findings expand the repertoire of regulatory sequences that mediate the effect of the stress on translation."

                        "text": "We provide a potential mechanistic link between eIF4E and the effect of TSS nucleotides on translation following GS. First, eIF4E translation and protein levels are downregulated. This is in addition to the inhibition of its activity by 4EBP upon this stress (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bolster et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dubbelhuis and Meijer, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Krause et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Reiter et al., 2005</a>). The translation inhibition of eIF4E may be a backup mechanism for 4EBP-mediated inhibition. Second, mRNAs that differ in their cap-proximal nucleotides display differential affinity towards eIF4E in correlation with the observed sensitivity to the stress. Specifically, the TOP-like CCU that is highly repressed following GS exhibits much lower affinity compared to RNAs that initiate with an A or G which we found to be more resistant in their translation to the stress. Several previous studies that addressed the regulatory mechanism of the TOP element uncovered several trans-acting factors, positive and negative, that mediate the translational control of these mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</a>). Our findings add an additional layer of regulation of these mRNAs by demonstrating that under energy stress conditions, their inhibition/resistance is, at least in part, the outcome of the intrinsic properties of the translation machinery. It is possible that the signal-modulated trans-acting factors of the TOP element act to modify the eIF4E-mRNA affinity. For instance LARP1 interacts with both the TOP element and PABP to stimulate TOP mRNA translation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</a>). As an RNA binding protein with preference to pyrimidine-rich sequences this factor can greatly increase the recruitment of eIF4E to these mRNAs via PABP, which also interacts with eIF4G1."

As the two types of mRNA were inhibited to a similar extent by the cap analog it was concluded that the TOP and non-TOP mRNAs have similar eIF4E binding affinity. The discrepancy between this study and our results can be explained by the use of different assays. In the present study the binding affinity was measured directly using known amounts of RNA and eIF4E protein. Shama et al. inferred the relative affinity from an indirect assay in which the actual amount of eIF4E and the mRNAs are not known and the concentration of the cap analog was very high, above the saturating range. Another study does suggest a role of eIF4E in mTOR-regulated TOP mRNA translation on the basis of short-term pharmacological inhibition of mTOR in 4EBP-deficient cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Thoreen et al., 2012</a>). However, this conclusion was challenged since other stresses (oxygen and amino acid deficiencies) that also diminish mTOR activity resulted in TOP mRNAs repression in these cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Miloslavski et al., 2014</a>). It is possible that the reduction in eIF4E availability by means other than 4EBP may contribute to this regulation."

Remarkably, this phenomenon was particularly apparent following GS as the number of genes with 5\u2019end isoforms displaying differential RO was substantially elevated. The detailed analyses of several intriguing examples of transcript isoforms with differential translation reveal the potential of translational control via APs. Specifically, we found that differential transcription and translation of two central translation initiation factors, eIF4A and Pabp, contribute to the global inhibition of translation following energy stress. Both have GS-induced isoforms that result in up-regulation of inhibitory eIF4A and Pabp proteins. The GS-induced downstream intronic promoter of eIF4A drives the expression of an isoform with long 5\u2019UTR that consists of 10 uAUGs, yet this isoform is efficiently translated under GS. One possibility is that the GS-induced translational activity involves an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that can bypass the inhibitory effect of uAUGs. Alternatively, translation can be activated by uORF-mediated mechanisms in which phosphorylation of the subunit of eIF2\u03b1 favors translation of genes containing multiple uAUGs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Young and Wek, 2016</a>)."

Gradients were fractionated and the optical density at 254 nm was continuously recorded using ISCO absorbance detector UA-6. The collected samples were then merged to create three fractions: Polysome-free (F), Light (L) and Heavy (H). The use of three pools is sensitive to large changes in translation but relatively insensitive to smaller changes. RNA was isolated for each fraction using Trizol and Direc-Zol RNA mini-prep kits (Zymo Research). RNA spikes (0.25 ng GFP and 1pg Luciferase) that were transcribed (P1300, Promega) and capped (S1407, NEB) in-vitro using T7 RNA Polymerase were added into each fraction. Equivalent RNA volume was taken from each fraction for the library preparation for TSSs sequencing using the CapSeq method (with modifications) as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gu et al., 2012</a>). Specifically, the RNA samples were treated with Terminator 5\u00b4-Phosphate-Dependent Exonuclease (TER51020, Epicenter). Then, reaction volume was enlarged and CIP (M0290, NEB) was added to dephosphorylate non-mRNA RNAs (tRNA and 5S rRNA). DNaseI was added in this step. In order to remove mRNA 5\u2019Cap, the samples were treated with TAP (T19050, Epicenter) and then RNA linker was ligated at the 5\u2019end of the formerly capped mRNA by T4 RNA ligase (M0204, NEB). cDNA was prepared from each RNA sample by using hexamer random primers linked to illumina 3\u2019 Rd2 seq primer, index (unique barcode for each sample), 4nt-long UMI and P7 illumina adaptor. To increase the cDNA quantity, a linear PCR amplification (second strand synthesis) was performed with forward primer containing the ligated linker sequence and carries P5 illumina adaptor. Final library amplification PCR step was performed after calibrating the numbers of PCR cycles. Size selection with magnetic beads (Ampure XP, according to the manufacturer guidelines) was performed after cDNA synthesis for removal of fragments\u00a0&lt;\u00a0~150 nt and also after linear amplification and final PCR steps, in which sizes of\u00a0&gt;200 bp and\u00a0&lt;500 bp were selected.

For the label-free fluorescence measurements, purified eIF4E (300 nM) in TPA buffer with 0.1% Pluronic F-127 (NanoTemper) and 50 \u03bcg/ml yeast tRNA, was mixed with increasing concentrations of cap analog (1.25 nM to 10 \u03bcM; S1407, NEB) or capped RNA oligos (1.25 nM to 5 \u03bcM). The reaction was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min and then premium-coated capillaries (MO-Z005, NanoTemper) were loaded with the samples, and intrinsic fluorescence measurements were performed in a Monolith NT.LabelFree instrument (NanoTemper). Data analysis was performed with the Monolith NT.Analysis software (NanoTemper)."

The authors perform a global analysis of transcription start sites (using CapSeq) across polysome fractions in the presence and absence of energy stress, with the goal of identifying changes in translational efficiency that correlate with changes in promoter usage. These data reveal a striking relationship between the identity of the cap-proximal nucleotides and the translational response to stress, with mRNAs beginning with purines being relatively refractory to stress. Biochemical analyses indicate that the cap-binding protein eIF4E has an intrinsic preference for purine-initiated capped mRNAs, which \u2013 together with the finding that eIF4E levels are reduced during stress \u2013 may explain the translational efficiency data. The authors further present data that stress-induced changes in start site usage for the eIF4A and PABP mRNAs also contribute to the stress response. Together the authors present a model in which changes in TSS selection induced by stress are a critical component of the translational response to stress, with the initiating nucleotides playing a particularly important but previously unappreciated mechanistic role."

Rather than collecting many fractions from across a sucrose gradient in order to infer the number of ribosomes per mRNA (as done in some published methods, e.g. Wang et al. Mol Sys Biol 2016), the authors only collected the \"free\", light and heavy polysomes. Even with these three pieces of data, the authors combined the light and heavy polysome data for unknown reasons and calculated \"translational efficiency\" as simply (light+heavy)/(light+heavy+free). The result is a metric that is extremely insensitive to changes in translation rate, since only if an mRNA shifts &gt;2-fold in/out of the \"free\" fraction containing 0-1 ribosomes will an mRNA be labeled as down/up-regulated. This is problematic for the authors' conclusion that &gt;70% of transcripts are unchanged at the translational level in response to stress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) and implies that there are likely many more changes in translational efficiency than the authors capture with their method. More generally, the use of this translation metric rather than a superior alternative diminishes the impact of the manuscript. The authors should clearly explain somewhere in the manuscript that the use of three pools (rather than many small fractions) is sensitive to large changes in translation but relatively insensitive to smaller changes."

Alternatively, transcripts generated by different promoters might also be spliced differently or use alternative polyadenylation sites, any of which could contribute to the measured translational efficiencies. By attributing any differences in translation to transcription start site, the authors are implying causation from what is only a correlation. In addition to raising this possibility in the text, the authors should undertake some validation experiments for some of their example genes to show that differences in transcription start site alone are sufficient to impart different polysome sedimentation to the mRNAs."

In addition, because the CapSeq method relies on ligation to the 5' ends of RNAs, sequence differences at the 5' end likely affect how efficiently ends are captured by CapSeq. For these reasons, it's important to undertake some validation of the quantitative changes in transcription start site the authors describe, by using alternative methods such as Northern blotting. In addition, the wording used to describe quantitative changes in start-site usage should be toned down from its current form to be more consistent with what the data conclusively demonstrate."

By doing so, an additional layer of complexity in gene expression is uncovered which refers to the contribution of transcription-translation linkage to proteome shaping in response to stress. This by itself is an important take-home message, which opens up the door to future similar studies concerning the transcription-translation linkage angle in response to other stressors and physiological signals. Moreover, there are additional novel findings, holding important implications. First, is the discovery that the affinity of eIF4E to capped mRNA with a proximal C nucleotide is significantly lower compared to its affinity to capped- proximal purines. The experiment was performed using cutting-edge label-free technology. This is a major contribution to the long-lasting question related to TOP-mRNAs translation regulation under conditions of limiting eIF4E. The purpose of proximal C nucleotide, <i>only</i> in TOP-mRNAs, was never realized before. Thus, the current study points out for the first time at the importance of intrinsic properties of the translation machinery to TOP mRNA translation regulation by illuminating the critical importance of TSS/cap proximal nucleotides. Second important discovery is the stress-induced differential transcription of eIF4A and PABP genes which drives the (i) formation of inhibitory eIF4A isoform and (ii) high levels of PABP via translational regulation mediated by the alternative 5'UTR. Since both genes encode translation regulatory factors, this finding provides a demonstration of the tight linkage between transcription and translation in response to stress signals. Additional insights of the study relate to interesting examples many of which are relevant to gene expression during differentiation and cellular transformation."

Rather than collecting many fractions from across a sucrose gradient in order to infer the number of ribosomes per mRNA (as done in some published methods, e.g. Wang et al. Mol Sys Biol 2016), the authors only collected the \"free\", light and heavy polysomes. Even with these three pieces of data, the authors combined the light and heavy polysome data for unknown reasons and calculated \"translational efficiency\" as simply (light+heavy)/(light+heavy+free). The result is a metric that is extremely insensitive to changes in translation rate, since only if an mRNA shifts &gt;2-fold in/out of the \"free\" fraction containing 0-1 ribosomes will an mRNA be labeled as down/up-regulated. This is problematic for the authors' conclusion that &gt;70% of transcripts are unchanged at the translational level in response to stress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) and implies that there are likely many more changes in translational efficiency than the authors capture with their method. More generally, the use of this translation metric rather than a superior alternative diminishes the impact of the manuscript.

By attributing any differences in translation to transcription start site, the authors are implying causation from what is only a correlation.
