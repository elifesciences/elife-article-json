We report that hemocytes in the caterpillar, <i>Pieris rapae</i> are able to synthesize 5-HT following activation by lipopolysaccharide. The inhibition of a serotonin-generating enzyme with either pharmacological blockade or RNAi knock-down impaired hemocyte phagocytosis. Biochemical and functional experiments showed that naive hemocytes primarily express 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. The blockade of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> significantly reduced phagocytic ability; however, the blockade of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> increased hemocyte phagocytosis. The 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>-null <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> mutants showed higher mortality than controls when infected with bacteria, due to their decreased phagocytotic ability. Flies expressing 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> or 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> RNAi in hemocytes also showed similar sensitivity to infection. Combined, these data demonstrate that 5-HT mediates hemocyte phagocytosis through 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors and serotonergic signaling performs critical modulatory functions in immune systems of animals separated by 500 million years of evolution."

We report that hemocytes in the caterpillar, <i>Pieris rapae</i> are able to synthesize 5-HT following activation by lipopolysaccharide. The inhibition of a serotonin-generating enzyme with either pharmacological blockade or RNAi knock-down impaired hemocyte phagocytosis. Biochemical and functional experiments showed that naive hemocytes primarily express 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. The blockade of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> significantly reduced phagocytic ability; however, the blockade of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> increased hemocyte phagocytosis. The 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>-null <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> mutants showed higher mortality than controls when infected with bacteria, due to their decreased phagocytotic ability. Flies expressing 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> or 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> RNAi in hemocytes also showed similar sensitivity to infection. Combined, these data demonstrate that 5-HT mediates hemocyte phagocytosis through 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors and serotonergic signaling performs critical modulatory functions in immune systems of animals separated by 500 million years of evolution."

One of these receptors increases phagocytic activity in both insects, while the other has the opposite effect in the caterpillar and reduces this activity.Qi, Huang et al. also discovered that phagocytosis depends on which of these receptors is most common on the hemocyte cell surface, and demonstrated that insects exposed to bacteria start to produce more of the serotonin receptors that increase phagocytosis. Further experiments showed that fruit flies in which the gene for a serotonin receptor has been deleted are more vulnerable to bacterial infections due to their poor phagocytic ability."

It regulates or modulates a wide variety of processes in most invertebrates and vertebrates, such as metabolism (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sze et al., 2000</a>) and locomotion (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ranganathan et al., 2000</a>) in nematodes; reproduction (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anstey et al., 2009</a>), learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sitaraman et al., 2008</a>) in insects; physiologic states and behaviors, including pain, appetite, mood, and sleep (<a href=\"#bib30\">M\u00f6ssner and Lesch, 1998</a>) in humans. 5-HT also plays an important role outside of the central nervous system\u00a0(CNS) in immune signaling. Immune cells can synthesize and sequester 5-HT. For instance, human mast cells express the key peripheral 5-HT synthesizing enzyme, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH-1) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kushnir-Sukhov et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2008</a>). Mouse dendritic cells (DCs) express the serotonin transporter (SERT), taking up 5-HT from the microenvironment (<a href=\"#bib35\">O'Connell et al., 2006</a>). 5-HT regulates immune responses and inflammatory cascades via distinct receptors and different immune cells have been shown to express a different composition of 5-HT receptor subtypes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baganz and Blakely, 2013</a>). 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> may contribute to chemotaxis of eosinophils (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boehme et al., 2008</a>) and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors on alveolar macrophages can be activated by 5-HT (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mikulski et al., 2010</a>). However, most studies assess the in vitro response of immune cells to pharmacological agents. Therefore, the function of 5-HT signaling in vivo in are still unclear."

Phagocytosis, the uptake of large particles (&gt;0.5\u2009\u03bcm) into cells, allows for rapid engulfment of dying cells and pathogens by specialized phagocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils in mammals (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aderem and Underhill, 1999</a>). In insects, hemocyte phagocytosis is an important cellular defense response to pathogens and parasites (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lavine and Strand, 2002</a>). In lepidopteran insects, the granulocytes and plasmatocytes are the major phagocytes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kanost et al., 2004</a>). Cross-talk between the immune and nervous system may play a role in regulating phagocytosis in insects during infection. However, the roles of serotonin in insect phagocytosis are less well characterized compared with vertebrate counterparts, although there is evidence that 5-HT can enhance phagocytosis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baines et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kim et al.,2009</a>)."

Indirect evidence suggests that similarities between insects and mammals extend to the molecular mechanisms involved in the neuroendocrine control of immune function (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adamo, 2008</a>). Because of the relative simplicity of the insect immune system, examining the basic interactions between serotonin receptor-medicated second messenger systems and immune-related intracellular signaling pathways may be easier in insects. As an initial step toward this goal, we have made a comprehensive study in the caterpillar, <i>Pieris rapae</i> hemocytes to elucidate the function of 5-HT signaling in insect cellular immune responses. We found that hemocyte-derived 5-HT regulates phagocytosis in an autocrine manner through 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors, each of which produces distinct effects. Mortality experiments using <i>Drosophila</i> mutants and hemocyte-specific RNAi-silencing further found that both 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> are necessary for effective resistance to bacterial infections."

As a negative control, 5-HT antisera preabsorbed with 5-HT were invisible (lower). Serotonin synthesis requires two enzymes, tryptophan hydroxylase and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Tryptophan hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis encoded by two genes, TPH and TRH in insects, TPH1 and TPH2 in mammals. Both gene products have tryptophan hydroxylase activity in vivo. The TPH/TPH1 gene is expressed in non-neural tissues, and the TRH/TPH2 gene is expressed in neural tissues (<a href=\"#bib10\">C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Neckameyer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Watanabe et al., 2011</a>). The high-affinity SERT is a plasma membrane protein that can take up extracellular 5-HT (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rudnick, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Torres et al., 2003</a>). Thus, we performed RT-PCR to characterize TPH, TRH, and SERT expression in hemocytes. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows that hemocytes produced mRNA for <i>TPH</i>, but that transcripts of <i>TRH</i> and <i>SERT</i> were not detected. These results suggest that hemocytes do not selectively sequester 5-HT but can synthesize 5-HT using TPH. Then, we performed ELISA to quantify the amount of 5-HT released into the hemocytes\u2019 culture media. 5-HT levels increased significantly above that found in controls in cell supernatants 1\u2009hr after exposure of hemocytes to LPS. 5-HT levels reached maximal at 2\u2009hr and decreased at 4\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The real-time quantitative RT-PCR results also show that mRNA expression level of <i>TPH</i> was up-regulated by approximately sixfold relative to controls at 15\u2009min and at 4\u2009hr after LPS stimulation, suggesting a potential negative feedback regulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Therefore, it is concluded that hemocytes are able to synthesize and release 5-HT in vitro, and this activity is enhanced following their activation. We hypothesise that 5-HT may play an important role in hemocyte function."

Next, we tested si<i>TPH</i>-treated hemocytes (knock-down effect was approximately 80%, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) for their phagocytosis ability. After incubation with si<i>TPH</i> for 48\u2009hr, hemocyte phagocytosis rate was significantly decreased compared with the negative control. 100 nM 5-HT treatment could fully rescue the si<i>TPH</i> induced phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013I</a>). Collectively, these data indicate that hemocyte-derived 5-HT is critical for proper hemocyte phagocytosis upon immune challenge."

So far, five subtypes of 5-HT receptors including 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> are identified in insects (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blenau and Thamm, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gasque et al., 2013</a>). 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> couple with G<sub>i</sub> protein and decrease intracellular cAMP levels. 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> couple with G<sub>q</sub> protein, which can induce increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. 5-HT<sub>7</sub> couples with G<sub>s</sub> protein and increases cAMP levels (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blenau and Thamm, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gasque et al., 2013</a>). We performed a comprehensive analysis of 5-HT receptor gene expression in hemocytes by RT-PCR after stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS for 2\u2009hr.

This paper is the first to demonstrate that insect hemocytes express TPH and can synthesize 5-HT, like human macrophages (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakamura et al., 2008</a>). The exposure of hemocytes to LPS led to an induction of TPH expression and a release of 5-HT. Moreover, the secreted 5-HT appears to be an important autocrine stimulus. It promotes phagocytosis: inhibition of TPH either by a competitive inhibitor or siRNA silencing resulted in significantly decreased hemocyte phagocytosis."

Recent research has made progress in determining 5-HT modulated mammalian immune responses, especially regarding the machinery to produce, store, release, and respond to 5-HT in immune cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahern, 2011</a>). 5-HT was also reported to mediate immune responses, such as hemocyte phagocytosis, nodule formation and hemocyte population in insects (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baines et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kim and Kim, 2010</a>), but the signaling pathway is unclear. <i>Drosophila</i> TPH homolog gene <i>Henna</i> was found to be one hit in a genome-wide RNAi screen for genes that affect phagocytosis of <i>Candida albicans</i> by hemocytes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stroschein-Stevenson et al., 2006</a>).

Using selective antagonists and RNAi, we found that inhibition of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> decreases hemocyte phagocytosis. However, inhibition of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> enhances hemocyte phagocytosis. It seems that activation of these two receptors affects hemocytes in opposite ways. Interestingly, we found that 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> is dramatically up-regulated following hemocyte activation, but 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> is significantly down-regulated. Therefore, even though the two receptors have opposite functions upon activation, the overall effects of 5-HT signaling induced by immune challenge are favorable for hemocyte phagocytosis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Mammalian DCs also express 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, via which 5-HT induces chemotaxis and in vivo migration of DCs to draining lymph nodes (<a href=\"#bib31\">M\u00fcller et al., 2009</a>). Even though insect plasmatocytes are macrophage-like cells, 5-HT activates macrophage cells via 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakamura et al., 2008</a>) and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mikulski et al., 2010</a>), which are different from the receptor sub-types found in insect hemocytes.

The cells were subsequently washed twice with a bathing solution (152\u2009mM NaCl, 5.4\u2009mM KCl, 5.5\u2009mM glucose, 1.8\u2009mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.4). The coverslips were transferred to a microscopic chamber that was constantly perfused with the bathing solution at \u2248 2\u2009ml/min (<a href=\"#bib15\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). The fluorescence at 510 nm by excitation at 340 or 380 nm with a xenon lamp was measured with individual cells using an Easy Ratio Pro calcium imaging system (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ). Each experiment was repeated three times or more. EC<sub>50</sub> values were estimated by fitting to a dose-dependent curve in Origin Pro (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA)."

Inhibition of serotonin production decreased hemocyte phagocytosis. The authors identified two serotonin receptors expressed in hemocytes, <i>Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub></i> and <i>Pr5-HT<sub>2B</sub></i>. Blocking the activity of each of these receptors demonstrates that <i>Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub></i> promotes phagocytosis, while <i>Pr5-HT<sub>2B</sub></i> inhibits it. However, upon activation by LPS, the authors observed that <i>Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub></i> expression is up-regulated while <i>Pr5-HT<sub>2B</sub></i> is down-regulated, resulting in a net increase in phagocytosis during activation. The authors wanted to test the if inhibition of serotonin signaling decreases hemocyte phagocytosis in vivo, so they performed bacterial infection assays in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, comparing wild-type flies to 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor mutants. They found decreased phagocytosis of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor mutants as well as decreased survival upon infection. Overall, the authors argue that serotonin signaling plays an important role in insect innate immunity."

There are similar results already published for other insect species (Kim GS, Nalini M, Kim Y, Lee DW, Arch Insect Biochem Physiol. 2009; Kim GS and Kim Y, J Insect Physiol. 2010) and these need to be acknowledged up front in the introductory section with a sentence justifying why this study is still relevant. The reviewers found that the butterfly experiments are more detailed than in the older literature and that the extension to <i>Drosophila</i> opens up new possibilities for extending this research. Unfortunately, it is the fruit fly results that are not substantial enough to warrant an <i>eLife</i> publication. If some more characterization is presented in terms of phenotype and mechanisms, then this will achieve that goal. The authors are the best judges of the experiments that will further consolidate the fruit fly story. The manuscript will benefit from such addition. Of course, if necessary changes will take longer than 2 months, the authors could resubmit an expanded manuscript. The following major questions are provided as examples of questions that need to be addressed."

There are similar results already published for other insect species (Kim GS, Nalini M, Kim Y, Lee DW, Arch Insect Biochem Physiol. 2009; Kim GS and Kim Y, J Insect Physiol. 2010) and these need to be acknowledged up front in the introductory section with a sentence justifying why this study is still relevant. The reviewers found that the butterfly experiments are more detailed than in the older literature and that the extension to Drosophila opens up new possibilities for extending this research. Unfortunately, it is the fruit fly results that are not substantial enough to warrant an eLife publication. If some more characterization is presented in terms of phenotype and mechanisms, then this will achieve that goal. The authors are the best judges of the experiments that will further consolidate the fruit fly story. The manuscript will benefit from such addition. Of course, if necessary changes will take longer than 2 months, the authors could resubmit an expanded manuscript. The following major questions are provided as examples of questions that need to be addressed. 1) Is the receptor 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> required autonomously in hemocytes? Does hemocyte-autonomous RNAi of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> affect the phagocytosis response, CFU after infection, and overall survival after infection? The authors could use Hml\u2206-GAL4 and ideally two independent UAS-RNAi lines. For suitable readouts of CFU and phagocytosis see below.</i> "

It is now widely used in mammals (Fiala M et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 104:12849-12854, 2007; Berger SB et al., Nat Immunol.11:920-927,2010; Neaga A et al., J Immunol Methods. 2011) and insects including <i>Drosophila</i> (Cuttell L et al., Cell 135, 524-534, 2008; Ulvila J et al., J Leukoc Biol. 89(5): 649-59, 2011; Stone EFet al., PLoS Pathog. 8(1): e1002445, 2012; Lombardo Fet al., PLoS Pathog. 9(1): e1003145, 2013; Regan JC et al., PLoS Pathog. 9(10): e1003720, 2013; Garg A and Wu LP. Cell Microbiol. 16(2): 296-310, 2014). Besides, we also tested the classical trypan blue phagocytosis assay described by Elrod-Erickson et al. (Curr.

The results are in Author response image 1 and similar to that by the pHrodo dye assays (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Thus, we still used the pHrodo dye in phagocytosis assays of this paper."
