                    "text": "Viral replicase recruitment and long-range RNA interactions are essential for RNA virus replication, yet the mechanism of their interplay remains elusive. Flaviviruses include numerous important human pathogens, e.g., dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we revealed a highly conserved, conformation-tunable <i>cis</i>-acting element named 5\u2032-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) in the flavivirus genomic 5\u2032 terminus. We demonstrated that the UFS was critical for efficient NS5 recruitment and viral RNA synthesis in different flaviviruses. Interestingly, stabilization of the DENV UFS impaired both genome cyclization and vRNA replication. Moreover, the UFS unwound in response to genome cyclization, leading to the decreased affinity of NS5 for the viral 5\u2032 end. Thus, we propose that the UFS is switched by genome cyclization to regulate dynamic RdRp binding for vRNA replication. This study demonstrates that the UFS enables communication between flavivirus genome cyclization and RdRp recruitment, highlighting the presence of switch-like mechanisms among RNA viruses."

                    "text": "Viral replicase recruitment and long-range RNA interactions are essential for RNA virus replication, yet the mechanism of their interplay remains elusive. Flaviviruses include numerous important human pathogens, e.g., dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we revealed a highly conserved, conformation-tunable <i>cis</i>-acting element named 5\u2032-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) in the flavivirus genomic 5\u2032 terminus. We demonstrated that the UFS was critical for efficient NS5 recruitment and viral RNA synthesis in different flaviviruses. Interestingly, stabilization of the DENV UFS impaired both genome cyclization and vRNA replication. Moreover, the UFS unwound in response to genome cyclization, leading to the decreased affinity of NS5 for the viral 5\u2032 end. Thus, we propose that the UFS is switched by genome cyclization to regulate dynamic RdRp binding for vRNA replication. This study demonstrates that the UFS enables communication between flavivirus genome cyclization and RdRp recruitment, highlighting the presence of switch-like mechanisms among RNA viruses."

Major phylogenetic groups (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitvich and Firth, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Moureau et al., 2015</a>) of flaviviruses include mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs), tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFVs), insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs) and flaviviruses with no known vectors (NKVs). Leading to diseases with symptoms ranging from mild fever and rash to severe hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, the emergence and re-emergence of flaviviruses always arouses global concern. The flaviviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, and their genome is approximately 11 kb and contains a single ORF, which encodes a polyprotein precursor with more than 3000 residues. The precursor is further processed into 3 structural proteins (capsid, pre-membrane/membrane and envelope) and at least 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). The largest nonstructural protein, NS5, performs methyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib15\">Egloff et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>), guanylyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib27\">Issur et al., 2009</a>) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nomaguchi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yap et al., 2007</a>).

Genome cyclization, which is also modulated by the downstream of 5\u2032 CS pseudoknot (DCS-PK) in the capsid-coding region (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Borba et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2013</a>), is crucial for the translocation of NS5 from the 5\u2032 stem-loop A (SLA) promoter to the RNA synthesis initiation site at the 3\u2032 end (<a href=\"#bib18\">Filomatori et al., 2006</a>). However, the mechanistic details of this critical process are poorly understood. The 5\u2032 SLA structure and genome cyclization strategy were also identified in other phylogenetic groups of the flavivirus genus, although the specific details differ. The 5\u2032 UAR element in MBFV usually participates in the formation of a local hairpin, stem-loop B (SLB), in the linear conformation of the vRNA. The SLA and SLB elements are separated by a short uracil-rich sequence, which has been shown to mediate vRNA replication of DENV (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lodeiro et al., 2009</a>). In the present study, we demonstrated that the U-rich region of MBFV is involved in the formation of a conserved RNA duplex that is designated as a 5\u2032-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) because it locks the 5\u2032 UAR/SLB element between its two strands. A combination of our results suggested that the UFS and its cousin elements regulate the binding of viral RdRp to vRNA dynamically by switching their conformations in response to the long-range interactions between the viral 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Furthermore, UFS switching is a general replication strategy in flaviviruses with vertebrate hosts, highlighting their role in the host adaptation and evolution of flaviviruses."

To clarify the structural characteristics of the region downstream of SLA, representative sequences derived from various flavivirus species were subjected to the <i>mfold</i> RNA folding server (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zuker, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zuker and Jacobson, 1998</a>). Because the region of interest is involved in genome cyclization, both the 5\u2032 end sequences and the query sequences composed of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were analyzed. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> shows the representative results of the RNA structure prediction. The local RNA structures in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of DENV4 vRNA are demonstrated, and elements involved in long-range interactions are highlighted. Structure prediction of the 5\u2032 end local structures showed that the U-rich region of most MBFVs (except the YFV clade) forms a duplex with complementary sequences in or near the viral translational starting region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Because this duplex confines the 5\u2032 UAR/SLB element between its two strands, we designated it as the UFS. Furthermore, the UFS duplex was predicted to unwind due to the formation of the panhandle structure between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends when long-range interactions between the genome termini were considered (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

The SHAPE reactivity data were annotated on RNA structure models generated by <i>mfold</i> prediction and sequence comparison (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The SHAPE results were shown to agree well with the predicted RNA structures. It was shown that the UFS element of JEV forms a conical duplex structure under in vitro\u00a0conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) because all nucleotides of the UFS exhibited low SHAPE reactivity. Similar results were obtained for DENV serotypes 1, 3, 4 and ZIKV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D,E and F</a>), except that several nucleotides in the ZIKV and DENV1/3 UFS regions had elevated SHAPE reactivity, which was likely due to the presence of internal loops. In contrast, the SHAPE results indicated that the UFS duplex of DENV2 is highly unstable because the DENV2 UFS region showed considerable SHAPE reactivity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This result was consistent with thermodynamic calculations and suggested that the UFS duplex is a highly dynamic structure, at least in some flaviviruses. The presence of the DENV UFS duplex conformation was further confirmed by SHAPE analysis of DENV3 5\u2032 end RNA molecules containing mutations in the UFS (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It was shown that the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS region significantly increased in UFS-disrupted mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, D3-M13A and D3-M13B), and restoration of UFS base-pairing endowed the corresponding region with low SHAPE reactivity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, D3-M13C). The above results demonstrated that the UFS duplex can exist locally in the vRNA 5\u2032 end under in vitro conditions, suggesting that the UFS can assume the duplex conformation, at least under certain states of the flavivirus genome."

This peculiar localization of the UFS suggests a unique role in vRNA replication. Functional mutagenesis of the UFS was performed using a DENV4 replicon with internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-controlled viral translation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). To eliminate the possibility that productive 5\u2032-cap-directed translation is caused by mutations altering the start codon (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clyde and Harris, 2006</a>), which is embedded in the DENV4 UFS duplex, a nonsense mutation was introduced into the variable loop 3 of DCS-PK in the background of p4-cHPstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep to generate the p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep replicon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The replication characteristics of the two replicons were basically the same (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). First, a panel of mutants was generated, and their replication efficiency was assessed in BHK-21 cells. Disrupting the base-pairing of the UFS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>. M1A, M1B, M3A and M3B) greatly reduced vRNA replication, whereas reconstituting base-pairing by combining the corresponding mutations was able to restore vRNA replication (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>. M1C and M3C), although the M3C mutant replicated moderately less efficiently than the wild-type (WT) replicon, possibly due to the apparent primary sequence changes in the U-rich region. Next, the impact of the M1 and M3 mutations on the circularized vRNA structure was assessed using the <i>mfold</i> online server. It was shown that the overall genome cyclization pattern was only slightly affected by the M1 and M3 mutations (<a href=\"#SD12-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>), and the changes in the stability of the predicted circularized structures was considerable smaller than the changes in the local UFS structure. To further confirm the function of local UFS structure in vRNA replication, we designed a panel of mutations (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which nether affected vRNA cyclization pattern nor the internal loop structure in the circular form, and the corresponding mutants were assessed for replication efficiency. It was shown that disruption of UFS base pairing (mutant AGU and GAU) reduced vRNA replication greatly, whereas substituting of a few base pairs in the UFS (mutant AUA and ACG) only have moderate effects on vRNA replication."

To this end, DENV4 NS5-GVD-vRNAs containing different UFS mutations were transfected into BHK-21 cells by electroporation, and vRNA copies were determined at 4, 24, 48 and 72\u2009hr post-transfection. Only negligible differences in RNA stability were found between WT RNA and the mutants of the M1 or M3 groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>), and the stability of the M5C mutant was moderately reduced compared with that of the M5A mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Thus, the differences in the RNA stability of the UFS mutants did not account for their different replication characteristics. The above results demonstrated that the UFS element is required for virus propagation due to its function in vRNA replication. In agreement with the function of DENV4 UFS, we also showed that disrupting of the UFS greatly reduced viral propagation of ZIKV, whereas reconstitution of the UFS duplex restores ZIKV propagation by IFA tests performed in transfected BHK-21 cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Because NS5 encodes the RdRp activity required for vRNA synthesis and has specific interactions with the 5\u2032 end of vRNA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Filomatori et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lodeiro et al., 2009</a>), whether the UFS is involved in the recruitment of NS5 was examined. WT and UFS-mutated DENV4 5\u2032-300 nt RNA molecules were incubated with different concentrations of the NS5 RdRp domain (NS5Pol), and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by native PAGE. The binding of NS5Pol to 5\u2032-300 nt RNA containing the M1A or M1B mutation in UFS was much weaker than the binding to 5\u2032-300 nt WT RNA, whereas the 5\u2032-300 nt M1C and WT RNA bound to NS5Pol with comparable affinity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, top and middle panels). The 5\u2032-300 nt M3A and M3B RNA also interacted with NS5Pol weakly, whereas the combination of the two mutations apparently restored the interaction between NS5Pol and 5\u2032-300 nt M3C RNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, bottom panel). The above results indicated that the UFS duplex is required for efficient NS5Pol binding\u00a0in\u00a0DENV4. Moreover, EMSA assay demonstrated that the UFS duplex is also important for the efficient binding of JEV NS5Pol to its 5\u2032 end RNA (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the function of UFS in viral RdRp recruitment is conserved among flaviviruses."

Two bands were detectable in the blot: the upper template-sized band was generated by the terminal addition of biotin-11-CTP to the input template due to the terminal nucleotide transferase activity of NS5Pol in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and the lower band represented the dsRNA product of de novo RNA synthesis, which was confirmed by comparison of the electrophoretic patterns of the RdRp products and annealed dsRNA molecules (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Apparently fewer products were generated in the reactions containing templates with disrupted UFS elements compared with the reaction containing the 5\u2032-160 nt WT template, and restoration of the UFS duplex greatly increased the amounts of RdRp products in reactions using the corresponding 5\u2032-160 nt mutants as templates. Moreover, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiment using 5\u2032-160 nt RNA as a probe confirmed the function of UFS in NS5Pol recruitment, although the overall affinity of 5\u2032-160 nt RNA for NS5Pol was lower than that of 5\u2032-300 nt RNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

Furthermore, internal loops and/or wobble base pairs are prevalent inside the UFS or at the junction connecting the UFS and SLB, which further decreases their structural stability. To investigate whether the low stability of the UFS duplex is associated with its function, UA base pairs of the DENV4 UFS were progressively substituted with GC base pairs, and the replication efficiency of the corresponding mutants was assessed using the above replicon system in BHK-21 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). As expected, all mutants containing disrupted UFS elements showed only extremely low levels of replication (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, M2A, M2B, M4A and M4B). One single UA-to-GC substitution at different positions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, M2C1 and M2C2) had little effect on vRNA replication, in agreement with the above results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, M1C). Surprisingly, all UFS mutants containing 2 or more UA-to-GC base pair substitutions replicated poorly compared with the WT replicon (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, M2C and M4C). In contrast, the M5 mutant series, in which only one UA-to-GC substitution was involved, exhibited replication characteristics similar to the M1 and M3 series. The above results indicated that increasing the stability of the UFS duplex is harmful for vRNA replication."

Shortening the length of the internal loop to 1 nt or 2 nt did not affect vRNA replication greatly. In contrast, total deletion of the internal loop, which caused the SLB to stack onto the UFS, significantly reduced the vRNA replication efficiency (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, L1D, L2D and L3D). Moreover, replication assays performed for various purine-to-purine and purine-to-pyrimidine substituting mutations targeting the internal loop (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) suggested that the purine-rich properties of the internal loop are optimal for efficient DENV4 vRNA replication. Taken together, the above results demonstrated that the stability of the UFS duplex is a critical determinant for its function in vRNA replication. The defects in the vRNA replication of the over-stabilized UFS mutants were not caused by alternations in their affinity for NS5Pol, as an EMSA indicated that the 5\u2032-300 nt M2C RNA bound to NS5Pol efficiently (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The M1A, M1B and M1C mutations (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), as well as the M3 series mutations (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), had little effect on the formation of 5\u2032-3\u2032 complex. However, when the M2 series mutants were assayed, although the M2A and M2B mutations also did not influence the formation of 5\u2032-3\u2032 RNA complex apparently, the complex formed by the 3\u2032 UTR and 5\u2032-300 nt M2C RNA was greatly reduced compared to the amounts of complexes formed by the 3\u2032 UTR and other 5\u2032-300 nt RNA species (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Estimation of dissociation constant (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) revealed that the Kd of 5\u2032-300 nt M2C binding with 3\u2032 UTR is approximately ten\u00a0fold higher than the Kds of the other 5\u2032 RNAs. These results together indicated that increasing the stability of the UFS hinders vRNA terminus interactions. Furthermore, the 5\u2032-300 nt L3D mutant, in which the internal loop was deleted, also interacted with the 3\u2032 UTR poorly (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

When the 5\u2032:3\u2032 ratio was 1:1, the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS element in 5\u2032-300 nt WT RNA exhibited a significant increase compared with the reactivity when the 3\u2032 UTR was absent, and the SHAPE reactivity of the SLB loop and 5\u2032 CS region was obviously reduced. When the 3\u2032 UTR was in 5-fold excess of 5\u2032-300 nt RNA, the SLB loop region of WT 5\u2032 RNA showed essentially no SHAPE reactivity, indicating a complete transition from the SLB structure to a UAR duplex. In contrast, when the 5\u2032-300 nt M2C RNA was incubated with an equal concentration of 3\u2032 UTR RNA, there were only minor changes in the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS and SLB loop regions compared with those of 5\u2032-300 nt M2C RNA alone. When the 5\u2032:3\u2032 ratio was 1:5, the SLB loop region of 5\u2032-300 nt M2C RNA still showed moderate SHAPE reactivity. The above results demonstrated that the UFS duplex is melted when the 3\u2032 UTR binds to 5\u2032 end RNA, and stabilization of the UFS renders it difficult to unwind in response to the 3\u2032 UTR and thus hinders genome cyclization. Thus, although the UFS does not participate in 5\u2032-3\u2032 hybridization directly, the stability of its secondary structure must be maintained below a threshold to enable the necessary conformational changes required for genome cyclization. It can be speculated that the unwinding of the UFS during genome cyclization may be important for its function in viral RNA synthesis."

The DENV4 WT mini-genome and those containing the desired mutations were constructed (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). First, using native PAGE, we found that the WT mini-genome, as well as the M1A, M1B, M1C, M3A, M3B, M3C and M2A mini-genomes, existed mostly in a circularized conformation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>), whereas the CS-M mutant, in which the 5\u2032 CS sequence was mutated, was confined to a linear conformation, as expected. The M2C mutant also mainly stayed in a linear conformation, agreeing with the results of the 5\u2032-3\u2032 RNA binding assay. The above results demonstrated that these corresponding mini-genomes are highly circularized; thus, it is unlikely that the UFS duplex structure exists in them. Next, the affinity of different mini-genomes for NS5Pol was assessed. The WT, M1A, M1B and M1C mini-genomes all showed low levels of binding to NS5Pol (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). In contrast, the CS-M mini-genome bound to NS5Pol with apparently higher affinity than the other mini-genomes tested (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>)."

The differences in RdRp activity between WT mini-genome and the UFS mutants were likely caused by changes of primary sequence in these constructs, In supporting of this, the M1C and M3C mutants were not able to reach the same level of replication as WT in replicon assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and it has been reported that the base composition of U-rich sequence in the UFS was actually able to affect vRNA replication of DENV2 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Friebe and Harris, 2010</a>).Taken together, the above results demonstrated that genome cyclization disables the function of the UFS in NS5Pol recruitment, suggesting that the UFS has to function dynamically during vRNA replication. Moreover, the attenuation of the affinity of NS5Pol for vRNA by genome cyclization is potentially important for the translocation of NS5Pol from the 5\u2032 end to the 3\u2032 end of vRNA."

However, circular states should be dominant among its conformations. Although the highly circularized mini-genome is much shorter than the actual viral genome, it has been theoretically proposed that the generic properties of a large RNA molecule lead its two ends to stay close to each other (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yoffe et al., 2011</a>), which was supported by results from single-molecule FRET assays (<a href=\"#bib33\">Leija-Martinez et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the flavivirus genome have great opportunities to contact each other, and due to the high affinity between them, most vRNA molecules would stay circularized in the equilibrium state. Moreover, protein factors have been shown to facilitate the cyclization of mRNA <i>and</i> vRNA\u00a0in vivo. In fact, the PABP protein, which bridges mRNA ends through poly(A)-PABP-eIF4E-5\u2032 cap interactions, has been shown to bind to the DENV 3\u2032 UTR (<a href=\"#bib46\">Polacek et al., 2009</a>). However, if the linear conformation of vRNA, the only conformation under which the UFS can exist, is present in low abundance, the question remains of how the latter can function."

A mechanistic model to explain the function of the UFS is described below. (i) vRNA released in the cytoplasm is translated to generate a sufficient level of viral proteins, which leads to the eventual binding of NS5 to the SLA and the initiation of (\u2212) strand synthesis, even without the presence of the UFS duplex. (ii) Completion of (\u2212) strand synthesis generates the dsRNA RF, which serves as the template for the synthesis of progeny vRNA in the presence of viral NS5/NS3 and other viral/host factors (not shown in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). (iii) During the elongation of the nascent (+) strand, the 5\u2032 terminus of the parental (+) strand RNA is displaced first, and the UFS duplex is folded on the protruding 5\u2032 end; this 'ON' state of the UFS facilitates the recruitment of NS5 to the free 5\u2032 end. (iv) After the completion of the nascent chain synthesis, the NS5-bound vRNA undergoes genome cyclization, and the UFS element is set to 'OFF' by the hybridization between genome termini, which decreases the binding strength of NS5 to the 5\u2032 terminus and promotes its translocation to the 3\u2032 terminus to initiate next-round synthesis of negative-strand vRNA. Such dynamic modulation of NS5 binding should be of great significance to maintain an appropriate level of (\u2212) vRNA synthesis to ensure the global balance of vRNA replication because the dsRNA RF is a highly active template for (+) vRNA synthesis."

Our results demonstrated that the UFS links two events of vRNA replication, NS5 recruitment and genome cyclization, together, and the structural stability of the UFS is elaborately balanced to meet the requirements of both. Especially, the conformational change of the UFS caused by genome cyclization is coupled with its function in modulating dynamic RdRp recruitment. As the function of UFS in viral replication and RdRp recruitment was investigated using different flaviviruses (DENV4, JEV and ZIKV), it is plausible to consider that the UFS is a general regulatory strategy of viral replication among the flavivirus genus. Although a previous report (<a href=\"#bib17\">Filomatori et al., 2011</a>) has suggested that the UFS may not be functional in DENV2, this was more likely to be an exception, as our SHAPE data also indicated that the UFS in DENV2 is highly unstable\u00a0in vitro, in contrast to the UFS elements from other viruses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

The UA-base-pair-rich UFS and the UFS-like element have been identified in MBFVs, two clades of NKVs, and ISFVs, demonstrating that the UFS element is evolutionarily conserved. Interestingly, while the UFS duplex unwinds during genome cyclization in MBFVs and NKVs, neither the conserved mode of genome cyclization nor the unwinding of UFS-like elements during this process was found in ISFVs. The ISFVs have been indicated to be the most divergent outgroup among the genus flavivirus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitvich and Firth, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cook and Holmes, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Moureau et al., 2015</a>), which led us to assume that modern flaviviruses are evolved from an insect virus ancestor. We speculated that primordial UFS-like structures are potential viral replication enhancers with RdRp-recruiting functions in ancient ISFVs. When the viruses were introduced into vertebrates, the intense selection pressure caused by shifting between two hosts promoted the emergence of a highly efficient genome cyclization strategy, and the UFS-like elements evolved into the RNA switches in modern flaviviruses. Moreover, although the UFS structure itself was lost when the ancestral ISFV adapted into ticks and some special vertebrates, its functional mechanism was inherited by the appearance of elements such as 5\u2032-SL2/CS-A in TBFVs. Thus, by looking into the evolutionary history of flaviviruses and exploring the modes of genome cyclization among them, we propose that the UFS may play a critical role during the evolution of the genus flavivirus."

Moreover, the replication of most positive-strand RNA viruses occurs in virus-induced membrane structures (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gillespie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Welsch et al., 2009</a>). It is possible that during (+) vRNA synthesis of flaviviruses, the parental (+) RNA is anchored to the vesicle membranes and prevented from being transported out of the vesicle through interactions between the UFS-containing 5\u2032 end and the membrane-bound viral replicase. Interestingly, DENV has been reported to conceal its dsRNA in membrane structures to escape from host immunity surveillance (<a href=\"#bib57\">Uchida et al., 2014</a>). Thus, other potential functions of the UFS need further investigation."

Such tactics have been observed in positive-strand RNA viruses, which infect animals, plants and bacteria (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nicholson and White, 2014</a>). However, to our knowledge, this is the first report describing that an RNA switch triggered by genome cyclization integrates the recruitment and translocation of the viral RdRp into the dynamic process of nascent RNA synthesis. This deliberate control mechanism used by flaviviruses could also be used by other positive-strand RNA viruses in similar forms, and further pursuit of these mechanisms will provide deeper insight into the replication and evolution of positive-strand RNA viruses."

The cell pellets were harvested and washed once with Buffer A (25\u2009mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 500\u2009mM NaCl, 25\u2009mM imidazole and 5% glycerol) and resuspended in Buffer A containing cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). After ultra-sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 30,000\u2009g at 4\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. The soluble recombinant NS5Pol protein in the supernatants was then purified using a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The fraction containing NS5Pol was eluted with Buffer A containing 300\u2009mM imidazole. The eluted protein was exchanged into 50\u2009mM Tris.Cl (pH 8.0), 300\u2009mM NaCl and 20% glycerol using a HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and concentrated to mg/ml grade by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (30\u2009kDa-cutoff, Merck Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was added into the purified NS5Pol protein to a final concentration of 1\u2009mM. The final product was dispensed into single-use aliquots and stored at -80\u00b0C before use. NS5Pol of JEV SA-14-14-2 strain was cloned, expressed and purified using the same strategy."

For the NS5Pol-RNA EMSA assays, the different DENV4 5\u2032-300 nt RNA species were first diluted in 0.5\u00d7 TE buffer and heated at 95\u00b0C for 2\u2009min. The RNA samples were then placed on ice immediately. 5\u00d7 RNA folding buffer T (250\u2009mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 500\u2009mM NaCl and 25\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) was added to the samples, and the RNA was refolded at 37\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. The concentration of the renatured RNA was set to 500 nM. The binding reactions contained 50 nM 5\u2032-300 nt RNA, 4\u2009\u03bcl of 5\u00d7 EMSA buffer (200\u2009mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 300\u2009mM NaCl, 25\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 0.05 mg/ml heparin sodium salt, 7.5% glycerol and different amounts of NS5Pol (0, 3, 5.25, 7.5 and 11.25\u2009\u03bcg) in a 20\u00a0\u03bcl volume. Due to the solvent components in RNA and protein preparations, the final reactions contained 64.15\u2009mM Tris.Cl (pH 8.0), 182.5\u2009mM NaCl, 5.5\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 nM EDTA and 375 nM DTT. The reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, and then, 10\u00d7 gel loading solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) was added, and the mixtures were separated by electrophoresis on 6% native PAGE gels running in 0.5\u00d7 TBE. The gel apparatus was placed in an ice-water bath to prevent the dissociation of RNA-protein complexes. After running at 60 V for 4\u2009hr, the gels were stained with SYBR Gold nucleic acid gel stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) for 30\u2009min, and gel pictures were captured using a BioSpectrum Imaging System (UVP, LLC, Upland, California) with a UV transilluminator. EMSAs using 5\u2032-160 nt RNA or mini-genome RNA were performed similarly, with a few exceptions: for the 5\u2032-160 nt RNA-based EMSA, the NS5Pol concentrations were higher (0, 5.4, 10.8, 16.2 and 21.6\u2009\u03bcg, respectively); for the mini-genome-based EMSA, the heparin concentration was set to 0.16 mg/ml, and the electrophoresis was performed with 4.5% PAGE gels at 75 V for 6\u2009hr in an ice-water bath. EMSA assay using JEV NS5Pol and 5\u2032-320 nt RNA was performed with similar conditions for DENV4 5\u2032-300 nt RNA EMSA assay."

According to previous reports (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Filomatori et al., 2006</a>), the RdRp reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for the desired length of time. The reaction products were purified using an RNAclean Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China), and 2\u00d7 RNA loading dye (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts) was added into the purified RNA. The samples were preheated at 70\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, snap-cooled on ice, and analyzed using 6% PAGE/8\u2009M urea gels. The gel-separated RNA was electro-transferred onto a Hybond N+ Nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). After air-drying the membrane, the transferred RNA was UV-crosslinked by a UV transilluminator for 10\u2009min. The membrane was blocked using 10% non-fat dry milk, and then streptavidin-conjugated HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) was incubated with the membrane at room temperature for 2\u2009hr. The membrane was then extensively washed using PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, and chemiluminescence signals were detected using a Pro-light chemiluminescent kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and a Smartchemi II imaging system (Sage Creation Science Co, Beijing, China)."

We have also noticed that the U rich region of UFS is predicted to hybrid with the 3' end sequences by algorithms such as <i>mfold</i>, however, this hybridization pattern was not supported by our SHAPE data in this work (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). We have shown that when the 5'-300 nt RNA and 3' UTR RNA of DENV4 forms a complex, which is an in vitro mimic of circularized genome, the U-rich region exhibited high SHAPE reactivity, suggesting that this region becomes single-stranded after genome cyclization. Thus we believe that the U-rich region is not directly involved in interaction with the 3' UTR, at least in DENV4. Besides, we totally agree that the impact of mutations on RNA cyclization and on the internal loop structure in the circular form should also be discussed. To this end, using the DENV4 mini-genome sequence as the query sequence, the influence of M1 and M3 mutations on genome cyclization was assessed by using the <i>mfold</i> on line server (<a href=\"http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form\">http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form</a>). The results of RNA structure prediction by <i>mfold</i> were provided as supplementary file, and the corresponding information has been added in the manuscript. It was shown that the overall genome cyclization pattern was only slightly affected by the M1 and M3 mutations (<a href=\"#SD12-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). The difference in free energy of the predicted circularized structures between WT and M1 mutants was only about 0.7 kcal/mol, whereas the M1A and M1B mutations decreased the local UFS structure by 3.4 and 2.3 kcal/mol, respectively, suggesting that these mutations mainly affected viral RNA replication through their disruptions of the UFS structure. Similar analysis was also performed for the M3 mutants (<a href=\"#SD12-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>), indicating more markedly local structure changes over those of circularized structures. To further confirm the function of local UFS structure in vRNA replication, we designed a panel of mutations (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3 \u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which neither affect the pattern of RNA cyclization nor the internal loop structure in the circular form, and the corresponding mutants were assessed for replication efficiency. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the disruption of UFS base pairing reduced vRNA replication greatly, whereas substituting of a few base pairs in the UFS only have moderate effects on vRNA replication. We believe that these new data and analysis would help to understand the function of UFS in vRNA replication in consideration of the impact of mutations on genome cyclization."

The above results also confirmed that the UFS structure was disrupted/destabilized or reconstituted as designed. These results of prediction were provided as supplementary file (<a href=\"#SD13-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). In fact, we have speculated the observed changes of SHAPE reactivity of SLA and 5\u2032 CS by UFS mutations M1A and M3A could be caused by the nature of data processing procedure of the QuShape software, which automatically determines the numbers of outliers in normalization procedure (described in QuShape Tutorial, which can be found at <a href=\"http://www.chem.unc.edu/rna/qushape/\">http://www.chem.unc.edu/rna/qushape/</a>). As the M1A/M3A mutants exhibited more highly reactive sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), the automatically normalization process of QuShape would make the overall SHAPE reactivity of these mutants to become generally lower than the less-highly-reactive- sites-containing WT or \u201cC\u201d mutants."

The results of EMSA indicated that the UFS element is required for the efficient binding of JEV NS5Pol to viral 5' RNA (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>),and we showed that disrupting of the UFS greatly reduced viral replication of Zika virus, whereas reconstitution of the UFS duplex restores Zika virus replication in BHK-21 cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these results demonstrated that the function of UFS element is indeed conserved in different flaviviruses. Regarding to the function of UFS in DENV2, although the biochemical assays mentioned by the reviewers indicated that UFS is not functional in DENV2 in vitro, the replication characteristics of the mutant 6U/6A (Lodeiro et al. 2009. J Virol. 83:993) was investigated only qualitatively. The original authors demonstrated that at 3 days post transfection, the DENV-positive cells were indistinguishable between WT and mutant 6U/6A, however, differences in replication were possible to be neglected as the authors did not provide the IFA results at 1-2 days post transfection, which is the period when most differences in flavivirus vRNA replication are observed. In fact, a similar mutant (Mutant poly (A)-10, Friebe et al. 2010. J Virol. 84:6103, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) was viable but showed reduced replication efficiency compared with its parental DENV2 replicon. Based on these reasons, we suggest that the previous evidences were not strong enough to conclude that the UFS is not functional in DENV2 vRNA replication. Even if the UFS was actually not a replication element in DENV2, that would make DENV2 to be an exception among flaviviruses based on our combined results. The relevant discussion was added into the first paragraph of the Discussion section."

This idea is interesting; however, the data presented is not sufficient to support the model. The minigenome WT and mutants bind the polymerase NS5 with low affinity (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a> and subsection \u201cGenome cyclization reduces the affinity of NS5 for vRNA by inducing the unwinding of the UFS\u201d, first paragraph). However, RNA synthesis is efficient with the WT RNA (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>), but not with mutant M1C (which is reconstituted). Also, it is uncertain why disrupted mutant M3A shows higher RNA synthesis than M3B? The presented data is over interpreted and the results do not support adequately the model proposed. Quantitative measurements should be provided and these discrepancies addressed.</i> "

We have analyzed the results of <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a> using ImageJ software, and demonstrated the RdRp activity as percentage of WT. In fact, the results in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> were not in conflict with the model which we have proposed. In <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>, we have shown that the mini-genomes are highly-circularized RNA molecules, and that means the UFS duplex is <i>not</i> present in these mini-genomes except for the CS-M mini-genome, which cannot circularize since the 5' CS element was mutated. Because of the above reasons, the mini-genomes except CS-M bind the polymerase NS5 with low affinity as shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>. In the meantime, the presence of the core promoter, SLA, in these min-genomes and their pre-circularized nature should ensure the template activities of them in RdRp activity assay. Since the UFS duplex was not present in the mini-genomes, its function will not be reflected in the RdRp activity assay using mini-genomes as templates. The differences in RdRp activity between WT and M1C and between M3A and M3B should be caused by changes of primary sequence in these constructs, but not the alteration of UFS structure. In supporting of this idea, the M1C and M3C mutants were not able to reach the same level of replication as WT in replicon assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Moreover, it has been reported (Friebe et al. 2010. J Virol. 84:6103) that substitution of U-rich sequence by adenosines is tolerated, but not by cytosines or guanosines. As the M1B and M1C mutants contains more guanosines in the U-rich region of the UFS than the other mutants, it is acceptable that these two mutants exhibited the lowest RdRp activity. We have added the above analysis into the corresponding Results section."
