These are expressed at low level on healthy cells, but are induced by stresses like infection and transformation. The physiological events that drive NKG2D ligand expression during infection are still poorly understood. We observed that the mouse cytomegalovirus encoded protein m18 is necessary and sufficient to drive expression of the RAE-1 family of NKG2D ligands. We demonstrate that RAE-1 is transcriptionally repressed by histone deacetylase inhibitor 3 (HDAC3) in healthy cells, and m18 relieves this repression by directly interacting with Casein Kinase II and preventing it from activating HDAC3. Accordingly, we found that HDAC inhibiting proteins from human herpesviruses induce human NKG2D ligand ULBP-1. Thus our findings indicate that virally mediated HDAC inhibition can act as a signal for the host to activate NK-cell recognition."

These are expressed at low level on healthy cells, but are induced by stresses like infection and transformation. The physiological events that drive NKG2D ligand expression during infection are still poorly understood. We observed that the mouse cytomegalovirus encoded protein m18 is necessary and sufficient to drive expression of the RAE-1 family of NKG2D ligands. We demonstrate that RAE-1 is transcriptionally repressed by histone deacetylase inhibitor 3 (HDAC3) in healthy cells, and m18 relieves this repression by directly interacting with Casein Kinase II and preventing it from activating HDAC3. Accordingly, we found that HDAC inhibiting proteins from human herpesviruses induce human NKG2D ligand ULBP-1. Thus our findings indicate that virally mediated HDAC inhibition can act as a signal for the host to activate NK-cell recognition."

Each of these ligands binds NKG2D with a different affinity, but expression of a single family member is sufficient to stimulate killing by NK cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Champsaur and Lanier, 2010</a>). Thus, expression of these ligands are tightly controlled and nearly absent on healthy cells. It is still not well understood how the majority of NKG2D ligands are silenced in healthy tissue, but work by L\u00f3pez-Soto and colleagues have shown that silencing by histone deacetylases (HDACs) is involved, at least for ULBP-1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">L\u00f3pez-Soto et al., 2009</a>). Most work on NKG2D ligand regulation has focused on their induction in cancer models.

Over 90% of the population is infected with one or more of these double stranded DNA viruses (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wald and Corey, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Staras et al., 2006</a>), which include cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex viruses (HSV), and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Co-evolution between herpesviruses and their hosts has resulted in a complex network of host-virus interactions that allows the host to sustain a life-long infection; the majority of infections are asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals (<a href=\"#bib50\">Taniguchi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Biron et al., 1989</a>). Herpesvirus infection causes a transcriptional upregulation of NKG2D ligand expression (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lodoen et al., 2003</a>), yet these viruses apply multiple strategies to avoid NKG2D recognition by reducing NKG2D ligand expression at the surface of infected cells (Reviewed in <a href=\"#bib19\">Jonji\u0107 et al., 2008</a>). This creates a balance between NK cell activation and viral evasion, and disruption of this balance can impact the outcome of infection. Hosts deficient in NK cell responses, including those with mutations that are predicted to specifically reduce NKG2D signaling, are especially prone to pathogenic herpesvirus infection (<a href=\"#bib50\">Taniguchi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Biron et al., 1989</a>). Conversely, growth of herpesviruses with a defect NKG2D ligand evasion are attenuated in vivo (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jonji\u0107 et al., 2008</a>)."

Furthermore, DNA damage signaling can mediate NKG2D ligand induction in both cancer development (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gasser et al., 2005</a>) and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) infection (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bekerman et al., 2013</a>).

We identified a single MCMV protein, m18, which is necessary and sufficient to induce expression of the RAE-1 family of mouse NKG2D ligands, and to induce NKG2D-dependent NK-cell killing in vitro. We found that m18 is a virally encoded HDAC inhibitor, and that it de-represses transcription of the <i>Raet1</i> gene. The m18 protein directly interacts with Casein Kinase II (CK2) and prevents it from activating HDAC3. Notably, we also demonstrated that other viral HDAC inhibitors encoded by human herpesviruses similarly drive NKG2D ligand expression. Thus we propose a model in which constitutive HDAC activity suppresses NKG2D ligand expression in healthy tissue. During infection herpesviruses express proteins that inhibit HDAC activity, directly or indirectly, and this drives NKG2D ligand expression."

Previously, we showed that MCMV gene expression was necessary to induce RAE-1 expression during infection (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tokuyama et al., 2011</a>). To identify the MCMV gene(s) responsible for this phenotype, we screened a panel of MCMV mutants (provided by Dr. Hidde Ploegh, Whitehead Institute) lacking genomic regions not essential for viral replication in vitro. We infected mouse fibroblasts with wild type (WT) or mutant MCMV and measured <i>Raet1</i> mRNA expression by RT-qPCR 24 hr post-infection (h.p.i). In contrast to WT MCMV or other mutant viruses, the MCMV mutant virus deleted for open reading frames (ORFs) m01 through m22 (\u2206m1-22) failed to induce <i>Raet1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We assessed whether this was the result of decreased infection or replication in our samples by measuring expression of MCMV immediate early gene 1 (ie1). Levels of MCMV ie1 were comparable to WT virus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These results indicate that a viral gene or a combination of genes in this region is required to induce <i>Raet1</i> expression."

Otherwise little is known about m18 or its function. To characterize m18 we assessed the expression of m18 over the course of infection by harvesting RNA of MCMV infected fibroblasts at 2,4,8,12, and 24 hr post infection and amplifying the full length (3 kB) m18 mRNA by reverse transcription followed by semi quantitative PCR. In accordance with previous studies we observed this was mRNA produced as early as 2 hr post-infection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lacaze et al., 2011</a>). To characterize the m18 polypeptide we expressed a C-terminal hemagglutanin (HA)-tagged m18 protein in mouse fibroblasts and NIH 3T3s and analyzed cell lysates by western blot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We observed a band at a size of\u00a0~180 KDa, well above the predicted size of 110 KDa, suggesting m18 is post-translationally modified. To evaluate m18 localization we expressed a C-terminal GFP m18 fusion protein in NIH 3T3s and analyzed localization of GFP by fluorescent microscopy. We found that the m18-GFP fusion protein localized mostly to the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

N- or C-terminally Strep-tagged m18 was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells, and native m18 complexes were captured by streptactin-affinity capture. Proteins were identified with peptide sequencing by LC-MS/MS, and the results are reported in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">2</a>. We used HEK293T for these assays as they allowed for direct comparison with similar virus-host AP-MS samples, and enabled us to identify high frequency background proteins found in this system (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>) (previously reported in 30). To rank the specificity of the remaining candidate protein-protein interactions, a <i>Z</i>-score was calculated with three affinity experiments and 598 unrelated virus-host APMS experiments (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). This allowed identification of the most specific interaction as casein kinase II beta (CSNK2B) in APMS samples from human HEK293T cells.

CK2 is a constitutively active kinase that phosphorylates HDAC3 at serine 424 (S424) activating it (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>). The activation of HDAC3 by CK2 has previously been demonstrated to help drive chromatin condensation during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Patil et al., 2016</a>) and has been shown to repress expression of genes during beige fat thermogenesis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shinoda et al., 2015</a>) indicating that this interaction can functionally regulate both chromatin structure and gene expression.

We transfected mouse fibroblasts with a construct encoding m18 C-terminally fused to RFP or a control vector only expressing RFP, and assessed HDAC3 S424 levels by IFA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). We compared the fluorescent intensity of HDAC3 S424 staining in the nucleus of m18 expressing cells, to non-transfected cells in the same field of view, and found significantly higher levels of HDAC3 S424 in m18 expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>).

This repression is maintained by constitutive phosphorylation and activation of HDAC3 by CK2. However, during MCMV infection, m18 reduces phosphorylation of HDAC3 by directly interacting with CK2 an activator of HDAC3. As a result, HDAC3 becomes less activated and the chromatin around the <i>Raet1</i> locus becomes acetylated and accessible. Sp3 is then able to recruit the general transcriptional machinery to transcribe <i>Raet1</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). These findings reveal how the chromatin environment contributes to silencing of <i>Raet1</i> in unstressed cells, as well as how a single viral protein relieves this repression."

Many of the known HDAC inhibiting proteins from herpesviruses are crucial to viral fitness (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nevels et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gu et al., 2005</a>). Our work demonstrated that for viruses, encoding HDAC inhibiting proteins comes at the cost of inducing NKG2D ligand transcription. It is thus tempting to speculate that viruses being unable to replicate efficiently without inhibiting HDACs have had to evolve a plethora of proteins that reduce NKG2D ligand expression at the protein level (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jonji\u0107 et al., 2008</a>)."

Cellular HDAC enzymes have been shown to repress viral gene expression and, in some cases replication. In the context of lytic infection herpes viruses must overcome this repression using viral HDAC inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nevels et al., 2004</a>), in fact chemical HDAC inhibition can rescue a defect in viral replication caused by HCMV IE1 deficiency (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nevels et al., 2004</a>). Additionally, viral gene repression by HDACs also promotes viral latency. HDACs have been shown to occupy the promoters of the immediate early genes that drive reactivation in HCMV and MCMV (<a href=\"#bib34\">Murphy et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2010</a>), and have been shown to repress KSHV reactivation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shin et al., 2014</a>). In fact, inhibition of HDACs is sufficient to drive reactivation in latently infected KSHV cell lines (<a href=\"#bib33\">Miller et al., 1997</a>). In these cases viral HDAC inhibitors may provide a way for the virus to promote its own reactivation from latency. Importantly, these proteins have been described in human viruses and their function in vivo has not been well established. We do not observe a role for m18 early in MCMV infection in vivo but it is possible that m18 inhibits HDACs in order to benefit the virus during later stages of infection such as during establishment of MCMV latency or reactivation from latency similar to KSHV. Thus, it will be interesting in the future to determine if m18 has alternative functions that contribute to viral fitness during later stages of infection."

Chemical CK2 inhibitors enhance the anti-viral effect of Type I interferon signaling during HSV-1 infection (<a href=\"#bib46\">Smith et al., 2011</a>), implicating CK2 as a key factor in host response to viral infection. It will be interesting in the future to elucidate how manipulation of CK2 by m18 impacts the host during viral infection."

Increased HDAC expression promotes carcinogenesis through down regulation of tumor suppressors such as p21 in an Sp1/Sp3 dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wilson et al., 2010</a>). As NKG2D ligand ULBP-1 is suppressed by HDAC3, it has been proposed that increased HDAC expression also contributes cancer\u2019s ability to evade NKG2D recognition (<a href=\"#bib31\">L\u00f3pez-Soto et al., 2009</a>). Several chemical HDAC inhibitors, including some used in this study, are being developed as anti-cancer drugs (<a href=\"#bib54\">West and Johnstone, 2014</a>). While these drugs act in multiple ways, one effect may be to induce expression of NKG2D ligands leading to increased NK cell recognition and NK cell activation (<a href=\"#bib31\">L\u00f3pez-Soto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">West and Johnstone, 2014</a>). Our study suggests that HDAC3-specific inhibitors may be particularly adept at leveraging this aspect of anti-cancer activity. CK2 is also highly upregulated in cancers (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2008</a>), and one intriguing possibility is that this may contribute to NKG2D ligand repression and NK cell evasion."

DNA abundance and quality was measured using a nanodrop ND-100 to analyze 260/290 ratios. Samples for use in qPCR were prepared as 2 \u03bcL of isolated DNA with 10 \u03bcL of iTAQ universal Syber Green supermix (Invitrogen) with primers at a concentration of 300 nM, and cycled as described above with Cq values calculated as detailed above. Between 5\u20137 biological replicates were used in each experiment, tissues from uninfected mice were included to control for viral DNA contamination, and buffer processed without tissues were included to control for non-viral DNA contamination. MCMV gB primers were described previously by Khairallah and collegues. Standard curve for the calculation of absolute genome number was done using known quantity of purified MCMV BAC. Genome copy per gram tissue was calculated from weight of starting material and genome copies in each sample. Limit of detection was defined for each experiment and tissue as the copy number calculated from the average Cq from uninfected tissue."

To this end, the annotated m18 orf was cloned into the pcDNA4TO expression vector encoding either an N-terminal or C-terminal 2X-StrepTag (m18-NS or m18-CS) for affinity purification and peptide sequencing by tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using methods identical to those previously reported (<a href=\"#bib13\">Greninger et al., 2012</a>) Briefly, 10 \u03bcg of vector were transfected into 15 cm cultures of HEK293T cells using a Transit-LT1 reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) at a 3:1 vol to mg plasmid, and the cells were grown for 48 hr. Lysates were prepared in 0.1% NP40, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. The M18 protein was captured on StrepTactin Sepharose, and then eluted with 1X desthiobiotin (IBA Technology, Gottingen Germany) as reported. To identify captured proteins by proteomic analysis, the protein samples were reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested in solution with sequencing grade porcine trypsin (Promega) following an identical protocol to that reported (<a href=\"#bib13\">Greninger et al., 2012</a>). The resulting peptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS on an LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a Nano-Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography system (Waters) for reversed-phase chromatography with a C18 column (BEH130; 1.7 \u03bcm bead size, 100 \u03bcm by 100 \u03bcm), using identical acquisition parameters as reported (<a href=\"#bib13\">Greninger et al., 2012</a>). MS data were searched using Protein Prospector software v. 5.10.17 (54) against the sequence of the m18 protein constructs and the NCBI Refseq human + virus database (downloaded Jan. 14, 2012) containing 131,459 sequences, concatenated with 131,459 additional randomized decoy sequences (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chalkley et al., 2008</a>). A false discovery rate of\u00a0&lt;1% was obtained using protein score of 22, peptide score 15, protein expectation value 0.05 and a peptide expectation value of 0.001. Modifications allowed in the protein identification search were: fixed carbamidomethylation of Cys and the following variable modifications: oxidation of Met, start-Met cleavage, oxidation of the N-terminus, acetylation of the N-terminus, and pyroglutamate formation from Gln. HEK293T cells were chosen for these experiments to allow for identification of frequent background proteins and for specificity scoring, by comparison with a background dataset of unrelated picornavirus-host APMS experiments assayed in the same experimental system (<a href=\"#bib13\">Greninger et al., 2012</a>, PMC4332878). Specificity scoring by Z-score was calculated using N\u00a0=\u00a03 m18 APMS experiments, which included one m18-NS and two biological replicate m18-CS experiments, and a background dataset of 598 unrelated picornavirus-host APMS experiments. Additional peptides for the m18 protein constructs were identified by allowing additional missed cleavages and Ser/Thr phosphorylation. Phosphorylation sites are reported with a site localization (SLIP) score, where SLIP\u00a0\u22656 corresponds to\u00a0&gt;95% confident site assignment (PMC3134073)."

The kinase has been identified as Casein Kinase 2. The study extends the known role of HDAC inhibiting virally encoded molecules. HDAC3 has been previously identified as a deacetylase target of DNA virus genes. Parts of this story have been previously described by the authors and other kinases have been known to modify the activity of deacetylases. The authors correctly refer to previous studies that document similar elements of the theme of regulation of enzymes that control expression of NK type ligands.

Thus, these data will be better served in a future study of m18\u2019s function in the MCMV pathogenesis. In addition, it remains possible that m18 plays a role in additional aspects of MCMV pathogenesis that were not investigating here such as latency establishment, reactivation or transmission.
