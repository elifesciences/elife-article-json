In contrast to previous virtual reality environments, which have contained houses, shops and other recognisable objects, Fog World contains only abstract landmarks that bear little resemblance to anything in the real world. The volunteers watched videos that simulated journeys through Fog World with the goal of learning the layout of the environment so that they could navigate within it. Of note, half of the landmarks in Fog World remained in fixed positions on all learning trials, while the other half changed location from one trial to the next."

In later trials towards the end of the learning period, the hippocampus also became active, and at this time communication between the retrosplenial cortex and hippocampus was also heightened. By the end of learning, the hippocampal activity was related to the volunteers' knowledge of the locations of the permanent landmarks across Fog World."

We still lack, however, a precise account of how an environmental representation evolves de novo and the roles played by space-sensitive brain regions in this process. It is surprising that such a gap in our knowledge exists given that learning new environments is ubiquitous and relevant for independent living and even survival. Moreover, examining the genesis of environmental representations would seem an ideal means of leveraging our understanding of the specific roles played by relevant brain areas, when they come online, what they respond to, and how and when regions interact with each other to support the emerging representation."

This exciting research is only just starting to provide clues about when specific brain areas become functional and in response to what, leaving much still to learn about the neural development of spatial cognition and memory (<a href=\"#bib52\">Mullally and Maguire, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wills and Cacucci, 2014</a>). In adult humans it is possible to study how multiple brain areas are engaged during navigation in large-scale environments by having subjects navigate in virtual reality (VR) while being scanned using techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI). In the majority of these experiments subjects become familiarised with an environment before scanning and then typically perform tasks during scanning based on the environmental representation they formed pre-scan (e.g., <a href=\"#bib38\">Janzen and van Turennout, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Spiers and Maguire, 2006</a>). A smaller number of VR scanning studies have focused on the acquisition phase of environmental knowledge (e.g., <a href=\"#bib85\">Wolbers et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Wolbers and Buchel, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Iaria et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Baumann et al., 2010</a>). However, as far as we are aware, in every case the environments contained landmarks and structures that were readily recognisable and nameable (e.g., shops and houses). Thus, the neural substrates of learning about an environment from scratch, with no prior experience of, or knowledge about, key elements within it, has never been examined in humans."

Prominent features in an environment, namely landmarks, have been posited to play a fundamental role (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tolman, 1948</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lynch, 1960</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Siegel and White, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Downs and Stea, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Golledge, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lew, 2011</a>). It has been further suggested that encoding landmarks facilitates the development of route knowledge, and learning how routes relate to each other then provides the navigator with a \u2018survey\u2019 representation of an environment (<a href=\"#bib61\">Siegel and White, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Epstein and Vass, 2014</a>). Despite landmarks being heavily implicated in many neuroscientific experiments in animals and humans over the decades, the effect of landmark properties on navigation has only recently been studied. <a href=\"#bib4\">Auger et al. (2012)</a>; (see also <a href=\"#bib51\">Mullally and Maguire, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Konkle and Oliva, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Auger and Maguire, 2013</a>) using fMRI found that PHC responded to visuospatial features of landmarks. By contrast RSC was engaged only when subjects viewed landmarks that had a permanent location and never moved (a finding that has since been replicated\u2014<a href=\"#bib49\">Marchette et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Troiani et al., 2014</a>). This suggests that a function of the RSC may be to code for permanent landmarks on which a stable spatial representation of an environment can then be built. But, as with the work mentioned above, the landmarks examined in these studies were of a type already familiar to subjects."

Comparing the visual salience ratings from the initial landmark characterisation study and the fMRI study was particularly interesting. While the correlation between the two was significant (p = 0.02), the slope of the correlation was not particularly marked (r = 0.314). The landmarks in the characterisation experiment were viewed one at a time and in isolation (so not as part of Fog World). By contrast, there was a tendency for subjects post-fMRI scan to rate landmarks as more salient if they had been experienced in Fog World to be large (r = 0.428, p = 0.001) or permanent (r = 0.315, p = 0.01). In other words, the visual salience of landmarks (or how \u2018attention grabbing\u2019 they were) was not just an inherent property; it was also influenced by how and where they had been experienced within the environment."

This was a challenging test given that subjects had only been exposed to the environment (with its five paths and 60 landmarks) for the previous 40 minutes or so. Participants were first shown an image of a landmark and instructed that they would have to navigate to where they thought it was located in the environment by as direct a route as possible. On each trial, subjects were placed within a version of the environment in which there was no fog and the target landmark had been removed. They moved their way to where they thought that landmark belonged (using the arrow keys on a keyboard) and then indicated their chosen location by pressing the space bar. There were 12 trials (nine involving permanent and three involving transient landmarks). If they thought the target landmark was transient (and so could not be placed in a single location), subjects were instructed to press the space bar and indicate that they thought it was transient. For the navigation task, each trial was scored out of 3, giving a maximum score of 36. One point was awarded for locating a landmark on the correct path, 1 point for the correct part and side of the path, and a final point was awarded if they had taken a direct route to the landmark.

We reasoned that having such variation between individuals enabled us to examine more meaningful relationships between fMRI responses and the learning of landmark permanence. If a brain region's response was directly linked to learning of landmark permanence, one would expect activity within such a region to directly track the acquisition of this knowledge. It was therefore important to have variance in the amount of learning by subjects in order to capture such a relationship (see \u2018Results\u2019 section, fMRI: accounting for subject-specific learning differences). Participants performed marginally better at identifying the transient landmarks, however the scores for the transient landmarks still only constituted an average of 38.8% (SD 27.3) of the total marks (from 25% of the trials). This shows that the transient landmark trials did not have a disproportionately large effect on the overall results. The distribution of scores (out of the total marks) on the post-scan navigation task was as follows: identifying the path 33.8% (SD 16.6), identifying the part and side of path 38.1% (SD 16.5), and using a direct route 28.0% (SD 15.8). This suggests that participants were not merely making simple path colour to landmark associations, and in fact identifying the part and side of path was where more marks were scored (part vs path: t<sub>31</sub> = \u22122.121, p = 0.042)."

This variation between individuals was important for allowing us to examine permanence-related fMRI activity in greater detail. It enabled us to identify fMRI responses which might directly track the variation in learning of landmark permanence (both between subjects and within individual people over time).

It did not even take the whole scanning session for RSC to develop robust and selective sensitivity to the stable landmarks. This demonstrates the remarkable adaptability of the process and hints at it being fundamental for learning about and orientating within our surroundings. Reassuringly, there was no difference in recognition of the permanent and transient landmarks in the first or final quarters. There was a brief discrepancy in the recognition of permanent and transient landmarks in the second and third quarters of learning, in favour of the permanent landmarks. We are not sure why this is the case, but speculate that perhaps when faced with entirely novel items, we remember them better if they are in a consistent setting."

This shows that participants were not overwhelmingly concerned with the permanence of landmarks, but rather seemed to instead be focused on their overall goal, namely the requirement to learn the environment and its layout. Additionally, in previous work (<a href=\"#bib4\">Auger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Auger and Maguire, 2013</a>), we have demonstrated that RSC responds to landmark permanence (for everyday outdoor items) when people are engaged in a completely incidental task. Whether this is also true when landmark permanence is learned incidentally should be probed in future studies."

These familiar, real-world items inevitably came with semantic and associative \u2018baggage\u2019 making it difficult to achieve precise experimental control over numerous different features of the items which are often correlated with one another (<a href=\"#bib73\">Troiani et al., 2014</a>) and could potentially confound any conclusions drawn (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sugiura et al., 2005</a>). Here, however, VR allowed us to investigate \u2018pure\u2019 representations of landmark permanence while this new information was freshly acquired. An additional advantage of using VR was that it provided a more ecologically relevant means with which to test the representation of landmark properties; it ensured subjects were actively engaged with the landmarks as they learned, in situ, the layout of the environment. However, one potential drawback of such a naturalistic, freely-behaving task is that it could introduce noise and variability to subjects' neural responses. This limitation was avoided by measuring fMRI activity when landmarks were viewed in complete isolation, as images presented between the learning videos. This not only ensured that subjects were focused on the specific relevant individual landmark at the necessary time, but also removed potential visual confounds which would have been present during the videos (e.g., path colour). Taken together with the prior studies, the current results highlight the flexible nature of RSC permanence representations. They can exist for items which are both real-world and alien; familiar or newly-encountered; viewed passively or when actively interacted with; and when attention is explicitly drawn, or not, to their permanence."

At the start of the learning process, RSC was not responsive to any feature of landmarks. Indeed, it was only during the third quarter of scanning that RSC became engaged at all, specifically reacting to permanent landmarks. The same was not true, however, for the POS region. It became strongly responsive to permanent landmarks at a similar time to RSC, but unlike RSC was engaged initially by another feature of the items\u2014their memorableness\u2014before their permanence became apparent. This is an important distinction as it indicates that the representation that develops in RSC is not only very sensitive to permanence but it is also highly specific. In the absence of reliable information regarding the permanence of landmarks, RSC did not just respond to some other feature. This finding is notable for another reason. In the literature, RSC and POS are sometimes grouped together and called \u2018retrosplenial complex\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Vass and Epstein, 2013</a>), with no differentiation made between the two brain areas. However, RSC and POS are cytoarchitecturally distinct and have different connectivity (<a href=\"#bib76\">Vann et al., 2009</a>), and given that we have now pinpointed differences in their responsivity, we suggest caution in using the over-general term retrosplenial complex."

This reveals that the permanence representation that emerges is not just a simple binary response which indicates whether or not an item is known to be stable. Instead it appears to be more informative, relating to the precision with which the permanence of landmarks is known. In addition, therefore, to identifying the most stable environmental cues, the RSC could also indicate how reliable subsequent representations based upon such cues might be. Overall, these results point to sophisticated, selective and specific processing of landmarks within RSC based upon their permanence."

For example, it could be that POS is tuned to navigationally \u2018useful\u2019 landmarks. Early in learning, in the absence of knowledge about landmark permanence, the memorable landmarks may have seemed more useful. Focus would then be expected to shift to the permanent landmarks which ultimately had greater utility for navigating and orienting. Alternatively, our results could indicate POS plays a role in relating landmarks with a specific location. This view is in keeping with a previous interpretation of processing within \u2018retrosplenial complex\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Vass and Epstein, 2013</a>), which often extends into posterior parts of the POS. At the start of the learning process, encounters with the most memorable landmarks (and the location they were experienced in) would have been particularly evident and so elicited the largest early responses. The level of activity for memorable landmarks would then diminish as those which are not fixed are repeatedly encountered in conflicting locations. The region would, at the same time, become increasingly engaged by the permanent landmarks with repeated experience of them in the same place. The large response at the start of the scan to the most memorable landmarks also explains why, unlike RSC, activity in POS was not directly related to the permanence learning-state. This interpretation also accounts for the lack of POS engagement in previous experiments (e.g., <a href=\"#bib4\">Auger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Auger and Maguire, 2013</a>), where the stimuli were never associated with specific locations. Therefore, while RSC appears specialised in processing the permanence of landmarks, the response profile of POS is more consistent with it playing some role in indexing navigational utility, or perhaps relating landmarks with the discrete locations where they have been encountered."

It seems then that the RSC may code for the stability of features within an environment, potentially providing this as an input to the hippocampus, which could in turn utilise the information to build detailed spatial representations based upon the most reliable cues. In terms of RSC-hippocampus connectivity, very few anatomical tracer studies have been conducted in humans. In the macaque monkey, RSC sends extensive cortical efferent projections to the medial temporal lobes (presubiculum, parasubiculum, entorhinal and PHC cortex; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kobayashi and Amaral, 2007</a>). It receives inputs from similar regions, most notably the hippocampal formation (entorhinal cortex, subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum), PHC and perirhinal cortices. In particular, Area 29 receives a large majority of projections from the hippocampus (both subiculum and presubiculum) and entorhinal cortex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aggleton et al., 2012</a>). Thus, it is not surprising then that we observe functional connectivity between RSC and the hippocampus, and in particular anterior hippocampus. This is also in keeping with many studies that have reported RSC and anterior hippocampus co-activing in fMRI studies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib86\">Zeidman et al., 2014</a>). In addition, inactivation of RSC in rats is associated with disruption of hippocampal place fields (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cooper and Mizumori, 2001</a>), and previous studies have reported hippocampal involvement in retrieving spatial information about objects (<a href=\"#bib59\">Save et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Manns and Eichenbaum, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Baumann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ekstrom et al., 2011</a>). We did not find responses relating to the landmarks in any other brain regions, but object-centred firing has also been observed in rodent lateral entorhinal (<a href=\"#bib16\">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2012</a>) and anterior cingulate cortex (<a href=\"#bib80\">Weible et al., 2012</a>), even for locations formerly (but no longer) occupied by objects (<a href=\"#bib74\">Tsao et al., 2013</a>).

These previous studies concluded that activity within the RSC reflected coding of space relative to stable landmarks.

While head direction cells have been found in rodent RSC (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cho and Sharp, 2001</a>), it has been estimated that these only account for approximately 8% of cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 1994</a>). What are the other 92% of cells in RSC doing, and how does this relate to landmark permanence? Intracranial recordings from human RSC have also been recently reported, showing increased responsivity to autobiographical memory retrieval (<a href=\"#bib26\">Foster et al., 2013</a>). We hope that the current results will encourage those conducting electrophysiological recording in humans and non-humans to explore the RSC and in particular its response to landmark permanence. By giving RSC its chance to be centre stage, we believe that new and important insights into how the brain performs the fundamental computations involved in representing and adapting to changes in the world will be forthcoming."

The world (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) contained five different coloured intersecting straight paths (yellow, red, grey, blue and green). Each path had 12 landmarks (six permanent, six transient) evenly distributed alongside it. A trial consisted of travelling along one of these paths. There were 60 trials in total, with the five paths being travelled 12 times each (i.e., once per learning sweep). Permanent landmarks remained in the same location on each trial, whereas transient landmarks appeared in a different location on every exposure. The locations in which all 60 landmarks appeared on each of the 60 trials were meticulously designed so that permanent and transient landmarks were equally distributed either side and along the whole length of each path. This ensured that the permanent and transient landmarks, as well as being matched for their perceptual features (size, visual salience, and other features\u2014see above), were placed in equivalent locations within the environment."

In these videos, the environment was covered in a shroud of fog to restrict the field of view and ensure close control over the exposure subjects had to all the landmarks. On each trial, the camera travelled along a path in a straight line. When a landmark emerged out of the fog, the camera turned to bring the landmark into the centre of the screen, where it was positioned for 2 s, the camera then panned back to the middle of the path as it continued travelling forwards (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> from top to bottom; see also <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The paths were always travelled in the same direction, with the same start and end point each time.

When the videos came to one of these intersections, the camera turned either left or right and the fog cleared enough to reveal three landmarks on the adjoining path. After 3 s, the landmarks were obscured by the fog again with the camera returning to the centre while continuing along the route. There were equal numbers of left and right turns at each intersection throughout the whole experiment and the ordering of the turns was pseudorandomised to ensure it was not predictable. The number of times each landmark was viewed during one of these intersection turns was also controlled so that overall exposure to all the landmarks remained identical.

We first considered responses across the whole scanning session, and in a second analysis divided the scanning experiment into quarters (which corresponded to the four scanning runs each consisting of three learning sweeps) in order to assess changes as subjects learned about the items. Potential issues associated with incidental changes in the BOLD signal over time were avoided by specifically comparing changes in the difference between permanent and transient landmarks. Permanent and transient landmark regressors were convolved with the haemodynamic response function. A separate regressor was created for the learning video time periods. This, along with participant-specific movement regressors were treated as covariates of no interest. We calculated subject-specific parameter estimates pertaining to each regressor of interest (\u03b2) for each voxel. Second level random effects analyses were then run using one-sample t-tests on these parameter estimates. We report all fMRI results at a whole brain threshold of p &lt; 0.05 (FWE), unless otherwise stated."

Parametric regressors from these scores were then entered into a whole brain GLM fMRI analysis. This enabled us to examine activity that was linearly modulated by each factor.

Early and late parts of the scanning session were compared separately (learning sweeps 1\u20136 and 7\u201312 respectively).

The priors and variance of the patterns of these voxel weights are used to constrain the models at a second hierarchical layer. The pattern weights are iteratively bipartitioned into subsets based upon the size of the weights; each successive partition isolates the subset with the largest pattern weights. These subsets are optimised using a greedy search with a standard variational scheme under the Laplace assumption (<a href=\"#bib28\">Friston et al., 2007</a>). Once the optimal set size is reached, this final set of patterns represents the decoding model with the greatest evidence for the pattern weights. Log model evidence values therefore represent the mutual information shared by the psychological variable (in this case knowledge of permanent landmark locations) and the pattern of voxel responses within that brain region. The log evidence of different models can then be directly compared."

We modelled the whole time period that permanent landmarks were in view during the learning videos. We defined the regions of interest anatomically (with one exception\u2014POS\u2014see main text), as exploring responses within the whole bilateral anatomical regions rather than smaller functionally-defined clusters within them provided maximal multi-voxel information for the characterisation of representations. We report all analyses with a log model evidence value above three as significant, as is common practise (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kass and Raftery, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Penny et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Friston et al., 2008</a>).

Using unfamiliar objects without pre-experimental semantic associations, the authors provide evidence that the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) represents the permanence of landmarks. The authors report increased activation in a number of brain regions, including the RSC and the posterior parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) when showing images of permanent compared to non-permanent landmarks, which were presented at multiple locations over the course of the experiment. Further analyses revealed that this effect emerged in the second half of the experiment as participants learned about which landmarks were permanent and which were not. Interestingly, the increased RSC activation in response to permanent landmarks paralleled participants' knowledge about landmark permanence. Parametric analyses using the landmarks' factor scores obtained in a factor analysis show that RSC and POS also exhibit increased responses for better remembered landmarks. The activation profile of the POS suggests that this region responds more strongly to more memorable landmarks at the beginning of the experiment before responding more strongly to permanent compared to nonpermanent landmarks in the last quarter of the experiment. Lastly, the authors relate multi-voxel patterns in the hippocampus towards the end of the experiment to the amount of information learned about the landmarks' locations."

On the one hand, the authors argue in the Introduction that de novo spatial learning has not been investigated in rodents since animals are \u2013 despite being exposed to novel environments \u2013 familiar with the general experimental procedures. But how is this conceptually different from the current study where probably most of the participants are familiar with viewing experimental stimuli (albeit unfamiliar ones) in a MRI scanner?"

I agree with the authors that these time periods are visually better controlled compared to the navigation videos in which the landmark is visible together with the differently colored paths in the VR environment. However, the restriction of the analysis to this time period also weakens the authors' conclusions about the role of the RSC in coding for permanent landmarks during environmental learning. Since participants were explicitly asked to indicate the permanence of recognized landmarks during the question period, this might have caused them to particularly represent this feature of the landmark in question. If the role of the RSC lies indeed in the coding of landmark permanence as assumed by the authors, then a modulation of RSC activity should also be evident when landmarks are viewed during the course of the navigation videos while participants tried to learn the layout of the VR environment."

What concerns me about this analysis is the low level of behavioral performance in the post-scan navigation test aiming at measuring knowledge of landmark locations. On average, participants score about 1/3 of the 36 possible points. While a trial (locating one landmark) could score a maximum of three points, the authors do not provide details about which points participants mostly obtained. It seems very likely that the majority of points were awarded for correctly identifying non-permanent landmarks. The highly-significant correlation between actual and judged landmark permanence suggests that participants were able to identify non-permanent landmarks. Additionally, a simple associative strategy might have accounted for points collected when participants replaced permanent landmarks. One of three points for a landmark was awarded for choosing the correct path. Since the five paths used in the task were colored differently, a simple association between landmark and path color might have been used to solve the task. This might explain why multi-voxel patterns in the hippocampus, whose role in associative learning is well established, mapped onto performance in the post-scan test."

The authors found that the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) was more active for permanent, as compared to transient, landmarks. Additionally, they found that the retrosplenial activity in response to the permanent landmarks increased over the course of learning, peaking in the final quarter of the experiment. Similar patterns of activity were shown in the posterior parieto-occipital sulcus (POS). These regions also demonstrated increased connectivity with the anterior hippocampus in the latter half of the study during viewing of permanent landmarks. Finally, while the RSC and POS demonstrated increased activity relating to the permanence of the landmarks, multivariate Bayes analysis revealed that hippocampal activity related to the locations of the landmarks, but only in the final stage of learning, when locations were best known."

I agree with the authors that these time periods are visually better controlled compared to the navigation videos in which the landmark is visible together with the differently colored paths in the VR environment. However, the restriction of the analysis to this time period also weakens the authors' conclusions about the role of the RSC in coding for permanent landmarks during environmental learning. Since participants were explicitly asked to indicate the permanence of recognized landmarks during the question period, this might have caused them to particularly represent this feature of the landmark in question. If the role of the RSC lies indeed in the coding of landmark permanence as assumed by the authors, then a modulation of RSC activity should also be evident when landmarks are viewed during the course of the navigation videos while participants tried to learn the layout of the VR environment</i>."

On average, participants score about 1/3 of the 36 possible points. While a trial (locating one landmark) could score a maximum of three points, the authors do not provide details about which points participants mostly obtained. It seems very likely that the majority of points were awarded for correctly identifying non-permanent landmarks. The highly-significant correlation between actual and judged landmark permanence suggests that participants were able to identify non-permanent landmarks. Additionally, a simple associative strategy might have accounted for points collected when participants replaced permanent landmarks. One of three points for a landmark was awarded for choosing the correct path. Since the five paths used in the task were colored differently, a simple association between landmark and path color might have been used to solve the task. This might explain why multi-voxel patterns in the hippocampus, whose role in associative learning is well established, mapped onto performance in the post-scan test</i>."

The authors should elaborate on their claim that, \u201cthe landmark-location representations in POS may have been discrete, while the spatial detail decoded in the hippocampus was related to the knowledge of the environment's overall layout and the location of all the permanent landmarks within it\u201d. Is there any evidence for this? Are there other possible accounts of the patterns of POS activity? It seems that by initially tracking the most memorable landmarks, and then once permanence information is learned, switching to track this measure, the POS could be generally tuned to whatever landmarks seem the most \u201cuseful\u201d navigationally. Before information about permanence has been ascertained, the most memorable landmarks may be the ones that are focused on, but once the participants determine which landmarks are permanent, they may shift to focus on these in order to orient and navigate better</i>."
