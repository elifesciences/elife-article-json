A central element of this process are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> are produced by a specialized RNA polymerase known as Pol V. Here we show that non-coding transcription by Pol V is controlled by preexisting chromatin modifications located within the transcribed regions. Most Pol V transcripts are associated with AGO4 but are not sliced by AGO4. Pol V-dependent DNA methylation is established on both strands of DNA and is tightly restricted to Pol V-transcribed regions. This indicates that chromatin modifications are established in close proximity to Pol V. Finally, Pol V transcription is preferentially enriched on edges of silenced transposable elements, where Pol V transcribes into TEs. We propose that Pol V may play an important role in the determination of heterochromatin boundaries."

A central element of this process are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> are produced by a specialized RNA polymerase known as Pol V. Here we show that non-coding transcription by Pol V is controlled by preexisting chromatin modifications located within the transcribed regions. Most Pol V transcripts are associated with AGO4 but are not sliced by AGO4. Pol V-dependent DNA methylation is established on both strands of DNA and is tightly restricted to Pol V-transcribed regions. This indicates that chromatin modifications are established in close proximity to Pol V. Finally, Pol V transcription is preferentially enriched on edges of silenced transposable elements, where Pol V transcribes into TEs. We propose that Pol V may play an important role in the determination of heterochromatin boundaries."

This process relies on small RNAs, which usually are generated by the activities of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and Dicer. Small RNAs are subsequently incorporated into Argonaute and direct repressive chromatin modifications to complementary genomic regions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</a>). Recognition of target sequences by small RNAs requires ongoing non-coding transcription of the targets. This non-coding transcription gives rise to long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which has been proposed to serve as a scaffold for Argonaute binding to chromatin, where incorporated small RNAs base pair with lncRNA (<a href=\"#bib18\">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> this lncRNA is produced by a specialized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, known as Pol V (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haag and Pikaard, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</a>). Activity of Pol V is required for DNA methylation but not for the biosynthesis of the vast majority of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kanno et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lahmy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pontier et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</a>). This implicates lncRNAs produced by Pol V (referred to as Pol V transcripts) as a factor required for recognition of target loci by siRNAs. Pol V transcripts are believed to be capped or triphosphorylated on their 5\u2019 ends and not polyadenylated on their 3\u2019 ends (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</a>). They associate with several RNA binding proteins, including ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</a>). It has been proposed that siRNAs incorporated into AGO4 base pair with Pol V transcripts and recruit AGO4 to specific loci in the genome. Binding of AGO4 is followed by the binding of INVOLVED IN DE NOVO 2 (IDN2) which interacts with a subunit of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex (<a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00f6hmdorfer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>). Finally, Pol V transcripts, AGO4, and/or other associated factors recruit DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2), which is a <i>de novo</i> DNA methyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00f6hmdorfer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhong et al., 2014</a>). DNA methylation is then responsible for repression of Pol II transcription on silenced loci (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lister et al., 2008</a>). While Pol V is involved in the late stages of the RdDM pathway, siRNA biogenesis starts with the activity of another specialized RNA polymerase, Pol IV (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herr et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Onodera et al., 2005</a>). Pol IV transcripts are substrates for RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2) and DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3), which produce 24nt siRNAs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haag et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2015b</a>)."

Unlike Pol IV transcripts, which are relatively abundant and have been characterized genome-wide (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blevins et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhai et al., 2015</a>), Pol V transcripts accumulate at low levels. This makes them difficult to detect using high-through sequencing approaches like RNA-seq. Therefore, it remains unknown if Pol V produces any RNAs beyond the very limited number of loci tested so far. It is also unclear what defines a Pol V promoter beyond published work suggesting that both Pol IV and Pol V are recruited by preexisting repressive chromatin modifications (<a href=\"#bib21\">Johnson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wierzbicki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>). It is further unknown which proteins interact with Pol V transcripts throughout the genome and how these proteins affect the transcripts. Additionally, the role of Pol V transcripts in forming the RdDM effector complex remains mysterious with several key mechanistic aspects being mostly based on speculation. These include the distance between the progressing polymerase and proteins binding to lncRNAs and the identity of nucleic acids base pairing with siRNAs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dalakouras and Wassenegger, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Matzke et al., 2015</a>). Finally, it is unknown if and how the specificity of Pol V recruitment to chromatin targets RdDM to individual genomic regions."

To overcome this limitation, we designed an experimental approach to identify Pol V transcripts throughout the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome. We first enriched Pol V-associated RNAs using RNA immunoprecipitation with an antibody against NRPE1, the largest subunit of Pol V (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pontier et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</a>), and then subjected the samples to high-throughput sequencing (Pol V RIP-seq). We performed these experiments in Col-0 wild-type and in the <i>nrpe1</i> mutant. This assay allowed the identification of genomic regions, where sequencing reads accumulated in Col-0 wild-type but not in <i>nrpe1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hence, these reads originate from RNAs which are specifically associated with Pol V. Given that Pol V is a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haag et al., 2012</a>), these reads most likely stem from transcripts generated by Pol V. We also detected a considerable amount of signal over annotated genes, however, these remained unchanged in <i>nrpe1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and are therefore unlikely to be associated with Pol V. This signal was mostly present on active genes and indicates transcription by Pol I, II, III, and/or IV."

Reproducibility between biological repeats was further tested by comparing Pol V RIP-seq signal intensities on annotated Pol V-associated RNAs in both repeats (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Signal strengths measured as differences between RPM normalized read counts in Col-0 and <i>nrpe1</i> were significantly correlated (Pearson correlation r = 0.719, p&lt;2.2*10<sup>\u201316</sup>), which further increases confidence in the quality of our transcript calling. Taken together, we developed a strategy which allows the sensitive and reproducible identification of Pol V-associated RNAs throughout the genome."

In contrast, regions giving rise to Pol V-associated transcripts, which do not overlap Pol V ChIP-seq peaks, still displayed reduction of DNA methylation in <i>nrpe1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), suggesting that RIP-seq is a much more sensitive approach for detecting genomic regions transcribed by Pol V. Overall, this analysis indicates that Pol V-associated transcripts are produced from regions bound by Pol V. Together with published <i>in vitro</i> data (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haag et al., 2012</a>), these results suggest that Pol V-associated RNAs identified using RIP-seq are produced by Pol V transcribing a genomic DNA template.

This would manifest itself in the presence of several shorter RNAs within most annotated Pol V transcripts. Alternatively, if Pol V had an external promoter, we would expect the presence of one predominant RNA with a transcription start site close to the beginning of the annotated transcript. Our RIP-seq protocol included sonication and random priming steps, which preclude us from directly capturing the ends of intact RNAs. However, we performed paired-end RNA sequencing, which provides an alternative way to distinguish between these two possibilities. To do so, we mapped the paired-end reads to all <i>Arabidopsis</i> transcripts annotated in TAIR10 as well as to Pol V transcripts. We then plotted the relationship between the transcript length and the mean size of paired-end sequenced RNA fragments mapping to this transcript (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). As the RIP-seq datasets include significant amounts of background reads originating from polymerases other than Pol V, we were able to determine the relationship between the size of each transcript known from TAIR10 annotations and the mean length of mapped read-pairs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Small Pol V transcripts also followed this relationship, however, longer Pol V transcripts did not produce longer sequenced fragments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This indicates that actual RNAs produced from annotated Pol V transcripts are shorter than the size of these annotations. If the relationship between transcript length and sequenced RNA fragments is the same or at least similar for Pol V as it is for other DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, we would predict an RNA length of 196 nt based on the median paired end fragment obtained from the first repeat of Pol V RIP-seq (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). A similar analysis of the second biological repeat of Pol V RIP-seq predicts a median RNA length of 205 nt. Considering that the median length of annotated Pol V transcripts is 689 nt (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), this indicates that annotated Pol V transcripts contain more than one transcription initiation and/or termination site. This is not only consistent with Pol V being controlled by internal promoters but also demonstrates that Pol V transcripts annotated in our study are not individual continuous transcriptional units but rather regions of Pol V transcriptional activity."

To test if the association with Pol V transcripts is a general feature of AGO4, we performed RIP-seq using an antibody against AGO4 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</a>) in Col-0 wild type, <i>ago4</i>, and <i>nrpe1</i>. Because the library prep method we used does not efficiently amplify siRNAs, this approach should specifically detect long RNAs associated with AGO4. AGO4 RIP-seq signal was significantly enriched on Pol V transcripts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) and this binding was dependent on Pol V (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The presence of AGO4 RIP-seq signal on most transcripts shown on the heatmap (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) indicates that AGO4 associates with most if not all Pol V transcripts. This is further supported by a significant correlation between Pol V and AGO4 RIP-seq signals (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, annotations based on AGO4 RIP-seq yielded transcripts with start and end sites similar to Pol V transcripts and overlapped regions with hallmarks of RdDM (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Stroud et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It should be noted that the RIP assay includes formaldehyde crosslinking, which may preserve indirect interactions. Therefore, the association we observed may reflect direct physical interactions or indirect interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in between AGO4 and lncRNAs."

They were characterized by RIP signal present in Col-0 wild type and <i>nrpe1</i> but not in <i>ago4</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and were depleted on transposons and enriched on intergenic sequences and promoters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

Alternatively, AGO4 could function without slicing Pol V transcripts. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed RIP-seq with the anti-NRPE1 antibody in the <i>ago4</i> mutant. Presence of slicing by AGO4 would predict longer and more abundant transcripts in the <i>ago4</i> mutant.

Moreover, analysis of the lengths of paired-end sequencing reads in the <i>ago4</i> mutant predicted an average transcript length of 200 nt, which is very similar to the size predicted for Col-0 wt (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). These results indicate that AGO4 does not slice Pol V transcripts. Instead, AGO4 seems to enhance Pol V transcription or to stabilize Pol V transcripts. This is consistent with slicing activity being dispensable for Ago recruitment to chromatin in <i>S. pombe</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jain et al., 2016</a>). Alternatively, AGO4 slicing products originating from Pol V transcripts could be undetectable in our assay due to their size or loss of association with the Pol V complex."

Effects observed in <i>ago4</i> and <i>idn2</i> were somewhat correlated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and could not be explained by an overall reduction of RNA levels in <i>ago4</i> and <i>idn2</i> as we did not observe a similar decrease on mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

                                "text": "The current models of RdDM show that AGO4, IDN2, and other RNA-binding proteins interact with Pol V transcripts at some distance from the transcribing core Pol V complex. This distance is allowed by the lengths of lncRNA and the C-terminal domain of Pol V which interacts with AGO4 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">El-Shami et al., 2007</a>). Although this spatial separation between Pol V and downstream factors has not been addressed experimentally, it predicts that the DNA methylation machinery may have some level of spatial flexibility especially over densely packed chromatin relative to the progressing position of the core Pol V polymerase complex. This flexibility could result in DNA methylation being established outside of the regions transcribed by Pol V. To test this possibility, we plotted Pol V-dependent CHH methylation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stroud et al., 2013</a>) on DNA sequences corresponding to Pol V transcripts. CHH methylation was significantly enriched within these sequences (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, only trace levels of CHH methylation were observed outside (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result shows that at least in genomic regions in close proximity to the annotated Pol V transcripts, the RdDM pathway is only able to deposit DNA methylation within regions transcribed by Pol V."

Similarly, AGO4 associated with chromatin (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>) mostly within Pol V transcribed regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These results show that, at least in genomic regions in close proximity to the annotated Pol V transcripts, several features of RdDM are predominantly restricted between the start and the end of Pol V transcription. Another and not mutually exclusive explanation of these results is that Pol V transcription is tightly limited to regions with preexisting DNA methylation. Both interpretations would be inconsistent with models assuming that the flexibility of Pol V transcripts could allow chromatin modifying enzymes to reach outside of the transcribed regions. Overall, these results are consistent with Pol V transcripts\u00a0working in <i>cis</i> and mediating repressive chromatin modifications exclusively within transcribed regions."

It remains unknown, which interaction is more important for RdDM. To answer this question, we focused our analysis on heterochromatic domains where protein binding to DNA may be constrained by a high density of nucleosomes but Pol V can still transcribe. We identified heterochromatic domains with high density of H3K9me2 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Moissiard et al., 2012</a>) and plotted various features of RdDM over their edges. Both Pol V binding to chromatin reported by ChIP-seq (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wierzbicki et al., 2012</a>) and Pol V transcription observed by RIP-seq overlapped the heterochromatic domains, which is consistent with Pol V transcribing silenced genomic regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). CHH methylation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stroud et al., 2013</a>) was also enriched on the heterochromatic domains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

However, current mechanistic understanding of RdDM does not explain this preference towards the edges of transposons. One possibility is that Pol V preferentially transcribes the edges of transposons. Alternatively, Pol V could transcribe the entire lengths of transposons but siRNAs could only be produced on the edges. To distinguish between these possibilities, we plotted Pol V RIP-seq data on all transposons which overlap annotated Pol V transcripts. While short transposons were entirely transcribed by Pol V, longer TEs had a strong enrichment of Pol V transcription on their edges (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We further analyzed euchromatic transposons longer than 4 kb, similar to those studied by (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zemach et al., 2013</a>). They also displayed a strong enrichment of Pol V transcription and Pol V-dependent CHH methylation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stroud et al., 2013</a>) on their edges (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Little is known about the mechanisms determining chromatin boundaries in plants, however, transcription is inherently directional and therefore could be involved in this process (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cohen and Jia, 2014</a>). Although Pol V tends to transcribe both strands of DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), a subset of Pol V transcripts is enriched on one strand (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) indicating that limited strand preference of Pol V may be involved in determining boundaries of heterochromatin. To test this hypothesis, we determined the ratio of strand preference of Pol V transcription relative to the orientation of transposons. We first analyzed transposons selected for the presence of overlaps with Pol V transcripts. Pol V transcription on the 5\u2019-ends of transposons was enriched on the sense strand while Pol V transcription on the 3\u2019-ends of transposons was enriched on the antisene strand. This indicates that Pol V transcripts showed an enrichment of Pol V transcription into the transposons at both ends (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Similarly, euchromatic transposons longer than 4 kb also showed enrichment of Pol V transcription into the transposons at both ends (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). In contrast, datasets of Pol IV transcripts (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blevins et al., 2015</a>) did not show any evidence of strand preference (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is consistent with the tight physical and functional association of Pol IV with RDR2 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haag et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Law et al., 2011</a>), which promptly converts Pol IV transcripts into double stranded RNA. Because accumulation of Pol IV transcripts requires RDR2 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blevins et al., 2015</a>), the existence of strand preference of Pol IV transcription remains unknown."

Therefore, the promoter of Pol V and mechanisms regulating Pol V transcription may determine which regions of the genome are targeted by RdDM. Previous studies using ChIP-seq failed to identify conserved sequence elements which could be the Pol V promoter (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wierzbicki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>). Despite much higher resolution of RIP-seq we also did not identify any conserved external or internal sequence elements. Although <i>de novo</i> discovery of promoter elements is difficult even on Pol II genes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Molina and Grotewold, 2005</a>) and requirement of short or variable sequence elements for Pol V transcription cannot be excluded, this is consistent with recent work showing the requirement of methyl-binding proteins SUVH2 and SUVH9 for Pol V binding to chromatin and transcription (<a href=\"#bib21\">Johnson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). Since SUVH2 and SUVH9 bind methylated DNA through their SRA domains (<a href=\"#bib22\">Johnson et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2014</a>), this indicates that pre-existing DNA methylation may serve as an equivalent of the Pol V promoter. We provide additional support for that possibility by showing a strong overlap between CG methylation and Pol V transcription. At the same time the accumulation of Pol V transcripts is not correlated with the levels of CG methylation and CG methylation is not sufficient to recruit Pol V. Moreover, Pol V transcription is limited to the edges of transposons, while DNA methylation usually spans the entire lengths of the transposable elements. This indicates that other unknown factors are involved in the determination and regulation of Pol V transcription."

Since we show that both strands of DNA are equally likely to be methylated even if siRNAs or Pol V transcripts show a strong strand preference, this could indicate that double stranded DNA is a substrate for DRM2. The simplest explanation for this observation would be base pairing between siRNAs and lncRNAs. Another result favoring siRNAs-RNA base pairing is our analysis of regions with high density of nucleosomes with H3K9me2.

Two of them are maintenance pathways which rely on CG methylation maintained by MET1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lister et al., 2008</a>) and non-CG methylation maintained by CMT2 and CMT3 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Stroud et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zemach et al., 2013</a>).

Recently, yet another pathway has been implicated in directing silencing to active transposons (<a href=\"#bib38\">McCue et al., 2015</a>). Our data show that Pol IV and Pol V direct RdDM to edges of transposons. Moreover, Pol V preferentially transcribes into transposons, which indicates that Pol V may be involved in determining the boundaries of heterochromatin on transposable elements. This is reminiscent of the BORDERLINE lncRNA in <i>S. pombe</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Keller et al., 2013</a>), however, unlike BORDERLINE, Pol V transcripts are more likely to maintain heterochromatin over the edges of transposons rather than to prevent the spreading of heterochromatin."

Some of the findings advance the current understanding of RdDM and should be of general interest as well.

The authors also concluded that Pol V transcripts are not sliced by AGO4, solely based on the data showing that average length of Pol V transcripts in <i>ago4</i> was similar to that in Col-0.

The authors provided an explanation for how AGO4 is prevented from binding to heterochromatin but did not explain how AGO4 is guided to regions outside heterochromatin. It is a bit strange that AGO4 was not ChIPed to RdDM regions. If AGO4 binds to Pol V transcripts, one would also expect AGO4 to be ChIPed onto Pol V transcribed regions through its binding to Pol V transcripts. In my opinion, without more biochemical data, it is premature to conclude that AGO4- associated siRNAs base pair with RNA exiting Pol V."

If they are transcribed by Pol V, then methylation alone, and not histone modification / heterochromatin is responsible for directing Pol V. If CG methylated genes are not transcribed, then methylation alone is not sufficient to direct Pol V.
