Here we present the structure of the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> TRIP13 ortholog PCH-2, revealing a new family of AAA+ ATPase protein remodelers. PCH-2 possesses a substrate-recognition domain related to those of the protein remodelers NSF and p97, while its overall hexameric architecture and likely structural mechanism bear close similarities to the bacterial protein unfoldase ClpX. We find that TRIP13, aided by the adapter protein p31(comet), converts the HORMA-family spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 from a signaling-active \u2018closed\u2019 conformer to an inactive \u2018open\u2019 conformer. We propose that TRIP13 and p31(comet) collaborate to inactivate the spindle assembly checkpoint through MAD2 conformational conversion and disassembly of mitotic checkpoint complexes. A parallel HORMA protein disassembly activity likely underlies TRIP13's critical regulatory functions in meiotic chromosome structure and recombination."

Here we present the structure of the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> TRIP13 ortholog PCH-2, revealing a new family of AAA+ ATPase protein remodelers. PCH-2 possesses a substrate-recognition domain related to those of the protein remodelers NSF and p97, while its overall hexameric architecture and likely structural mechanism bear close similarities to the bacterial protein unfoldase ClpX. We find that TRIP13, aided by the adapter protein p31(comet), converts the HORMA-family spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 from a signaling-active \u2018closed\u2019 conformer to an inactive \u2018open\u2019 conformer. We propose that TRIP13 and p31(comet) collaborate to inactivate the spindle assembly checkpoint through MAD2 conformational conversion and disassembly of mitotic checkpoint complexes. A parallel HORMA protein disassembly activity likely underlies TRIP13's critical regulatory functions in meiotic chromosome structure and recombination."

The HORMA domain (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aravind and Koonin, 1998</a>) is a conserved, structurally unique signaling module that forms complexes through a characteristic \u2018safety-belt\u2019 interaction in which the C-terminus of the domain wraps entirely around a short region of a binding partner (<a href=\"#bib36\">Luo et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sironi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). HORMA domain protein complexes participate in multiple cellular signaling pathways, including meiotic recombination control, DNA repair, and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). While the regulated assembly of HORMA domain protein complexes has been extensively characterized, the mechanisms underlying their disassembly, which requires significant conformational changes to disrupt the extremely stable safety-belt interaction, are largely unknown."

CO formation is promoted and regulated by a conserved family of HORMA domain proteins termed HORMADs. Early in meiotic prophase, HORMADs localize to chromosomes along their entire lengths, where they promote the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks and bias the repair of those breaks toward the homologous chromosome (<a href=\"#bib66\">Subramanian and Hochwagen, 2014</a>). In both yeast and mammals, excess recombination is limited by a feedback mechanism that removes or redistributes HORMADs along the chromosome after sufficient COs have formed. The removal of HORMADs depends on a conserved AAA+ family ATPase, Pch2/TRIP13, without which the frequency and spatial distribution of COs is disrupted (<a href=\"#bib53\">San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00f6rner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Joshi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Wojtasz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Roig et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). We have previously shown that the HORMADs assemble into higher-order oligomers through head-to-tail safety-belt interactions, and that these interactions are critical for their meiotic functions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). As a predominant family of AAA+ ATPases function to disaggregate or disassemble protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sauer and Baker, 2011</a>), it has been proposed that Pch2/TRIP13 mediates HORMAD removal from chromosomes through specific recognition and disassembly of chromosome-associated HORMAD complexes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2014</a>)."

In this pathway, unattached kinetochores generate an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) called the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which is composed of the MAD2, CDC20, BUBR1, and BUB3 proteins (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hardwick et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fraschini et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sudakin et al., 2001</a>). MAD2 is a relative of the meiotic HORMADs, and exists in one of two conformers: an inactive \u2018open\u2019 state (O-MAD2), and an active \u2018closed\u2019 state (C-MAD2) (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) that binds CDC20 through a safety-belt interaction to form the core of the MCC (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sironi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Luo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shah et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2012</a>). After all kinetochores become properly attached to microtubules, new MCC assembly is halted and the SAC is inactivated. Timely SAC inactivation requires two factors, TRIP13 (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wang et al., 2014</a>) and the HORMA domain protein p31(comet) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Habu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Xia et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hagan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Varetti et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Westhorpe et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ma et al., 2012</a>), which recent evidence suggests may act together to directly disassemble the MCC. p31(comet) specifically recognizes and binds C-MAD2, and the p31(comet)-MAD2 interface overlaps MAD2's interface with BUBR1 in the intact MCC (<a href=\"#bib86\">Xia et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Tipton et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that p31(comet) may compete with BUBR1 for MAD2 binding. Further, the combined activities of p31(comet) and TRIP13 can cause the dissociation of MAD2 from immunoprecipitated CDC20 or BUBR1 complexes in vitro (<a href=\"#bib69\">Teichner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eytan et al., 2014</a>)."

Here, we show that Pch2/TRIP13 comprises a new family of AAA+ ATPase protein remodelers, with a substrate-recognition domain similar to the NSF/p97/PEX1 remodeler family and a physical mechanism closely related to the bacterial ClpX unfoldase. We show that TRIP13 converts closed, active MAD2 to its inactive open conformer, and that p31(comet) functions as an adapter to recognize closed MAD2 and deliver it to TRIP13. Thus, TRIP13 regulates the SAC through MAD2 conformational conversion and safety belt disengagement, and a similar mechanism for HORMAD complex disassembly likely underlies the enzyme's regulatory functions in meiosis."

These proteins share a common architecture, with a family-specific N-terminal domain (NTD) responsible for localization or substrate recognition, and one or two AAA+ ATPase modules that typically assemble into a hexameric ring. AAA+ ATPases are extremely diverse and include DNA and RNA helicases, DNA replication initiators, and a large family termed the \u2018classic remodelers,\u2019 which disaggregate or unfold proteins; these include the SNARE complex disassembly factor NSF, the ubiquitin-directed disaggregase p97/Cdc48, and the ATPase component of the eukaryotic proteasome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</a>)."

Moreover, sequence comparisons of the Pch2/TRIP13 NTD fail to identify homology to any known proteins. Therefore, we took a structural approach to determine the relationship of Pch2/TRIP13 to other AAA+ ATPases. We overexpressed and purified <i>Mus musculus</i> TRIP13 and its <i>C. elegans</i> ortholog PCH-2, and found that while TRIP13 adopts a range of oligomeric states from monomer to hexamer, PCH-2 forms a stable hexamer both with and without added nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). We next performed negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) on PCH-2; low-resolution class averages reveal a distinctly asymmetric hexamer in the absence of nucleotides, which becomes more symmetric and compact when ATP is added (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We attempted crystallization both in the presence and absence of nucleotides, and successfully determined the crystal structure of PCH-2 without added nucleotide to a resolution of 2.3 \u00c5. The structure reveals an elongated hexamer with an approximate \u2018dimer of trimers\u2019 symmetry and an overall shape similar to our EM class averages of this state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

These proteins possess two-part NTDs with tightly associated N-N and N-C subdomains (<a href=\"#bib41\">May et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Yu et al., 1999</a>). A hydrophobic cleft between the two subdomains binds either directly to substrates, or alternatively to \u2018adapter\u2019 proteins that aid localization and specific substrate recognition (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kloppsteck et al., 2012</a>). In PCH-2, the NTD contains a single folded domain similar to the NSF/p97/PEX1 N-C subdomain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and as such does not share these proteins' substrate-binding hydrophobic cleft. Nonetheless, the similarity in NTD structure indicates a hitherto unappreciated evolutionary link between Pch2/TRIP13 and the NSF/p97/PEX1 remodeler family (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and strongly suggests that the PCH-2 NTD is involved in substrate recognition, either directly or indirectly through one or more adapter proteins."

Although no nucleotides were added during purification or crystallization of PCH-2, we observed that two subunits in the hexamer (chains B and E) are bound to ADP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), enabling a close analysis of PCH-2 active site structure. PCH-2 possesses the characteristic Walker A, Walker B, Sensor-1, and \u2018arginine finger\u2019 motifs in the large AAA domain that cooperate to bind nucleotide (<a href=\"#fig1 fig2\">Figures 1B, 2E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wendler et al., 2012</a>). In many AAA+ ATPases, nucleotide binding is sensed by an additional \u2018Sensor-2\u2019 motif, typically an arginine residue, reaching from the small AAA domain into the active site. This motif is involved in nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and nucleotide-dependent inter-domain conformational changes in various AAA+ ATPases (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ogura et al., 2004</a>). Curiously, the \u2018classic remodelers\u2019 family, including NSF/p97/PEX1, uniformly lacks the Sensor-2 motif and also possesses a second arginine adjacent to the arginine finger (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These differences indicate that this family's mechanism for ATP-driven conformational changes may have diverged somewhat from other AAA+ ATPases (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ogura et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</a>). Pch2/TRIP13 proteins, in contrast, possesses only a single arginine finger (R312 in <i>C. elegans</i> PCH-2), and our PCH-2 structure shows that a conserved arginine (R385) is properly positioned to act as a Sensor-2 motif (<a href=\"#fig1 fig2\">Figures 1B, 2E</a>). This finding suggests that despite sharing a common NTD with a family of \u2018classic remodelers\u2019, the detailed mechanism for nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in Pch2/TRIP13 may more closely resemble other AAA+ families."

                                "text": "The dramatic conformational differences between subunits, and the resulting overall hexamer architecture of PCH-2, are distinct from most existing structures of AAA+ \u2018classic remodelers\u2019, which are typically either symmetric or display a subtle helical pitch resulting in a \u2018lock-washer\u2019 conformation, and usually lack the significant rotations between large and small AAA domains seen in PCH-2 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davies et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lander et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Zhao et al., 2015</a>). Instead, the PCH-2 structure closely resembles several prior structures of the ClpX unfoldase, which contain four \u2018closed\u2019 and two \u2018open\u2019 subunits arranged in the same pattern as in PCH-2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F,G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glynn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Stinson et al., 2013</a>). This conformation was observed both in the absence of nucleotides (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glynn et al., 2009</a>) and in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (ATP-\u03b3-S), which was found to bind the four \u2018closed\u2019 subunits but not the two \u2018open\u2019 subunits (<a href=\"#bib64\">Stinson et al., 2013</a>). Detailed biochemical analysis of the ClpX mechanism has demonstrated that sequential ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release drive cyclical open \u2192 closed \u2192 open conformational changes within each subunit (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glynn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Stinson et al., 2013</a>). These motions in turn drive axial movement of loops lining the hexamer pore (pore loops), which contain aromatic residues that directly engage substrate proteins during unfolding (<a href=\"#bib60\">Siddiqui et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Iosefson et al., 2015</a>). Despite a potentially diverged mechanism for ATP-powered conformational changes, the classic remodelers possess functionally equivalent pore loops (<a href=\"#bib89\">Zhao et al., 2010</a>). Within each half-hexamer of PCH-2 (chains A/B/C and D/E/F), the pore loops (residues 217\u2013226; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) are axially staggered to create a \u2018spiral staircase\u2019 of likely substrate-engaging groups. We interpret these pore loop positions as representing structural intermediates adopted during ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release within each PCH-2 subunit that drive substrate remodeling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>)."

Both enzymes showed modest but reproducible ATPase activity, and mutation of conserved active site residues resulted in the complete loss of activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>). We next tested the importance of the enzymes' pore loops, which in other AAA+ ATPases are necessary to properly couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate engagement (<a href=\"#bib60\">Siddiqui et al., 2004</a>). We generated alanine mutants of PCH-2 W221 and F222, which align with the ClpX/NSF \u2018YVG\u2019/\u2018GYVG\u2019 motifs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), and also created a \u2018pore loop AG\u2019 mutant (PCH-2<sup>AG</sup>) in which residues 218-227 were replaced by an Ala-Gly linker of equal length. These mutants all formed soluble hexamers as in wild-type PCH-2, but showed variable ATPase activity: while PCH-2<sup>F222A</sup> showed a fivefold reduction in basal ATPase activity, PCH-2<sup>W221A</sup> and PCH-2<sup>AG</sup> showed a striking increase in activity, with the <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub> of PCH-2<sup>W221A</sup> around threefold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E</a>).

As p31(comet) is known to bind both MAD2 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Habu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yang et al., 2007</a>) and TRIP13 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Tipton et al., 2012</a>), we reasoned that the protein may act as an adapter. We mapped sequence conservation onto the structure of human p31(comet):MAD2 (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yang et al., 2007</a>), and identified a highly conserved surface on p31(comet) opposite its MAD2-binding interface (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To test whether this surface, which includes residues on the p31(comet) \u2018safety-belt\u2019 and a short loop bordering this motif, is responsible for TRIP13 interaction, we generated a series of mutations in <i>M. musculus</i> p31(comet). Several mutations to this conserved surface disrupted TRIP13 binding in a yeast two-hybrid assay, while retaining MAD2 binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Conversely, a previously-characterized mutant at the MAD2 interface (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yang et al., 2007</a>) disrupted MAD2 binding but did not affect the interaction with TRIP13 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). To test whether p31(comet) is able to simultaneously interact with MAD2 and TRIP13, we performed a yeast three-hybrid assay. This assay showed an interaction between TRIP13 and MAD2 that depends on the presence of untagged p31(comet) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), showing that p31(comet) can indeed function as an adapter between MAD2 and TRIP13 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>)."

We separately purified <i>M. musculus</i> TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup>, which is catalytically inactive and forms more stable hexamers than wild-type TRIP13 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), wild-type p31(comet), and a monomeric variant of MAD2 (MAD2<sup>R133A</sup>) in which open (O-MAD2) and closed (C-MAD2) monomers can be separately purified (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sironi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Luo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mapelli et al., 2006</a>). We mixed TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup>, p31(comet), and C-MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> in the presence of ATP, and measured complex formation using size-exclusion chromatography. In agreement with prior studies (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yang et al., 2007</a>), p31(comet) and C-MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> formed a stable heterodimeric complex. When this complex was pre-incubated with TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup>, a small amount of both proteins was shifted into the TRIP13 hexamer peak (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Semi-quantitative analysis of Coomassie-stained gels, and light-scattering based molecular-weight measurements on this peak, revealed that for each TRIP13<sup>E235Q</sup> hexamer, about 1 copy of p31(comet):C-MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> was shifted into the TRIP13 peak (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). MAD2 did not shift in the absence of p31(comet), and only a very small amount of p31(comet) shifted in the absence of MAD2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). p31(comet) mutants that disrupt either MAD2 or TRIP13 binding also largely eliminated p31(comet):MAD2 co-migration with TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together with our yeast two-hybrid results, these data suggest that a single p31(comet):MAD2 complex associates with a TRIP13 hexamer, first through transient TRIP13-p31(comet) binding (likely mediated by the TRIP13 NTD), then through direct interactions between TRIP13 and MAD2 (at the TRIP13 hexamer pore). We were unable to directly test the role of the TRIP13 pore loops in binding, however, as the TRIP13<sup>W221A/E253Q</sup> double mutant did not form stable hexamers (data not shown)."

If TRIP13 functions by unfolding MAD2, or alternatively converting C-MAD2 to O-MAD2, a prolonged incubation with TRIP13 should eliminate the stimulatory effect of p31(comet) + MAD2. This is indeed the case: we found that the ability of p31(comet) + MAD2 to stimulate TRIP13 ATPase activity was almost eliminated after a 2-hr pre-incubation, in an ATP-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, compare samples #2, 3, and 4). Importantly, p31(comet) and MAD2 were in sixfold molar excess to TRIP13 hexamers in this assay, illustrating that each TRIP13 hexamer acted on multiple p31(comet):MAD2 complexes during the pre-incubation period. Addition of fresh MAD2 to the pre-incubated samples rescued TRIP13 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, sample #5).

When we incubated p31(comet) + C-MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> with TRIP13, the p31(comet):C-MAD2 complex that initially forms was dissociated, and C-MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> was converted to the open conformer (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This conversion depended on active TRIP13, ATP, and p31(comet). Despite a high rate of ATP hydrolysis, the TRIP13<sup>W221A</sup> pore-loop mutant was unable to catalyze MAD2 conversion, illustrating that pore loop integrity is critical for MAD2 conformational conversion. To directly measure the catalytic activity of TRIP13, we titrated the enzyme and monitored C-MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> to O-MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> conversion. At 37\u00b0C, a single TRIP13 hexamer catalyzes the conversion of 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 MAD2 molecules per minute (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Combining this measurement with TRIP13's fully-stimulated ATPase activity in these conditions (16.7 \u00b1 0.3 ATP min<sup>\u22121</sup> per hexamer; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>), we estimate that TRIP13 hydrolyzes 8\u201310 ATP's per MAD2 conformational conversion. This number is similar to several prior measurements of NSF-mediated SNARE complex disassembly (6\u201350 ATP per event, depending on experimental conditions) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cipriano et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ryu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shah et al., 2015</a>) or ClpX-mediated unfolding of a small model substrate (\u223c150 ATP) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burton et al., 2001</a>), likely reflecting that MAD2 conformational conversion may require only a local perturbation of the safety-belt motif, rather than complete unfolding (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). This idea would fit with recent work indicating that NSF unfolds its substrates in a single step, using the energy from multiple ATP hydrolysis events to build up tension within the hexamer, then promoting a critical conformational change that results in SNARE complex disassembly (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ryu et al., 2015</a>). A similar \u2018spring-loaded\u2019 mechanism in TRIP13 could enable the enzyme to catalyze conversion/disassembly of unliganded C-MAD2 or its complexes with partner proteins such as CDC20 with similar efficiency; alternatively, if MAD2 conformational conversion requires several rounds of ATP hydrolysis, the energy requirements for disassembly of ligand-stabilized MAD2 may be significantly higher than the 8\u201310 ATP we measured for C-MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> conformational conversion."

First, the PCH-2 hexamer architecture shows close mechanistic parallels with ClpX, suggesting a shared mechanism for nucleotide-dependent conformational changes driving pore loop motions and substrate remodeling. Our structural and biochemical data suggest that Pch2/TRIP13 engages its substrates within the hexamer pore, and undergoes coordinated ATP hydrolysis-coupled conformational changes to mediate substrate unfolding. In contrast to ClpX, however, Pch2/TRIP13 does not completely unfold its HORMA domain protein substrates. Rather, we have shown that TRIP13 catalyzes a much more subtle structural change, converting closed MAD2 to its open state. We propose that TRIP13 specifically unfolds the C-terminal safety belt region of MAD2, then allows it to refold into the open state. Given the mechanistic similarities between Pch2/TRIP13 and the processive unfoldase ClpX, however, an obvious question is how unfolding by Pch2/TRIP13 is controlled to achieve HORMA domain conformational conversion instead of complete unfolding."

                        "text": "The answer to this question may lie in the second aspect of Pch2/TRIP13's hybrid nature: its mode of substrate recognition, which is mediated by an NTD related to a family of \u2018classic remodelers\u2019 including NSF, p97, and PEX1. Importantly, as in NSF and p97, substrate recognition by Pch2/TRIP13 is indirect with p31(comet) acting as an adapter to deliver MAD2 to TRIP13. p31(comet) binds specifically to C-MAD2, meaning that once TRIP13 engages and unfolds the MAD2 safety belt, p31(comet) would cease to bind MAD2. This could destabilize the ternary complex, releasing partially-unfolded MAD2 and allowing its re-folding into the open conformation. As mentioned above, MAD2 safety belt unfolding could occur in a processive manner accompanied by multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis by TRIP13, or could occur similarly to NSF, where recent work has indicated a single-step \u2018spring-loaded\u2019 mechanism for SNARE complex disassembly (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ryu et al., 2015</a>). In the SAC, we propose that p31(comet) and TRIP13 catalyze a two-step MCC disassembly mechanism to inactivate the SAC (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). First, p31(comet) displaces BUBR1 from MAD2, potentially causing its dissociation from MAD2:CDC20. The resulting p31(comet):MAD2:CDC20 complex is then recognized by TRIP13, which converts C-MAD2 to O-MAD2, thus disrupting binding to both p31(comet) and CDC20, and also preventing MCC re-assembly."

These data strongly suggest that cellular factors actively maintain MAD2 in the open state. We propose that a major role for TRIP13 and p31(comet) may be to counteract spontaneous O-MAD2 to C-MAD2 conversion, thus guarding against improperly-timed MCC assembly (which can occur outside mitosis given a supply of soluble C-MAD2 [<a href=\"#bib71\">Tipton et al., 2011a</a>]) and also ensuring a sufficient supply of O-MAD2 for SAC activation in prometaphase. An important remaining question is how the competing pathways for MCC assembly and disassembly are balanced and regulated throughout the cell cycle: do p31(comet) and TRIP13 constantly disassemble MCC at a low level during prometaphase and metaphase, with this activity becoming dominant only after new MCC assembly is ceased, or is the activity of p31(comet) and TRIP13 suppressed during metaphase by additional mechanisms? Recently it was shown that human p31(comet) is phosphorylated specifically in mitosis, and that phosphorylation lowers the affinity of p31(comet) for MAD2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Date et al., 2014</a>). While the phosphorylated residue (Ser102) is not universally conserved in p31(comet) orthologs, this result nonetheless represents one potential mechanism for suppressing TRIP13-mediated MCC disassembly specifically during mitosis."

We have been unable, however, to detect direct interactions between PCH-2/TRIP13 and their putative HORMAD substrates, nor do these proteins stimulate PCH-2/TRIP13 ATPase activity (not shown). Thus, how the enzyme recognizes HORMAD complexes, whether a p31(comet)-like adapter is needed for this recognition, and what signals coordinate crossover formation with HORMAD complex remodeling and removal, remain important open questions. Finally, given the additional association of human <i>TRIP13</i> with a number of cancer types (<a href=\"#bib34\">Larkin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">van Kester et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee et al., 2014</a>), addressing the fundamental mechanistic questions regarding how this enzyme recognizes and remodels its substrates will be important for understanding TRIP13's multiple roles in human health and disease."

                                "text": "For crystallization, PCH-2 was exchanged into crystallization buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine [TCEP]), either without added nucleotide (Apo) or with 1 mM ADP or non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs (ATP-\u03b3S or AMP-PCP). Regardless of added nucleotides, PCH-2 formed large prism-shaped crystals after mixing 1:1 with 100 mM sodium citrate pH 5.6, 200 mM ammonium sulfate, and 15% PEG 3350. Crystals were cryoprotected by the addition of 20% glycerol, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at synchrotron sources (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), and processed with HKL2000 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</a>) or XDS (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kabsch, 2010</a>). All crystals were in space group C222<sub>1</sub>, with one PCH-2 hexamer per asymmetric unit. The structure was determined using phases obtained from a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) dataset from a crystal grown from selenomethionine-derivatized protein. Automated XDS \u2192 SHELX \u2192 PHENIX for the SAD dataset was performed by the RAPD data-processing pipeline at the Advanced Photon Source NE-CAT beamline 24ID-E (<a href=\"https://rapd.nec.aps.anl.gov/rapd\">https://rapd.nec.aps.anl.gov/rapd</a>). 46 selenomethionine sites were identified using SHELX as implemented in hkl2map (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sheldrick, 2010</a>), then supplied to the AutoBuild module of PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib70\">Terwilliger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>), which located an addition 22 sites (for 68 total\u201466 sites would be expected for a hexamer of PCH-2, but in several cases two sites represented alternate rotamers for a single methionine residue), and calculated and refined phases using PHASER (<a href=\"#bib42\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) and RESOLVE (<a href=\"#bib70\">Terwilliger et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"http://www.solve.lanl.gov\">http://www.solve.lanl.gov</a>). Initial sequence-threaded models of the large and small AAA domains were generated by the PHYRE2 server (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</a>) (<a href=\"http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2\">http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2</a>) and manually placed to generate an initial model. Initial placement and refinement of this model allowed identification of twofold non-crystallographic symmetry, which was then used during early-stage map generation, model building, and refinement (final refinement was performed without non-crystallophic symmetry). Numerous rounds of manual rebuilding in Coot (<a href=\"#bib12\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and refinement in phenix.refine (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>) against a high resolution native dataset resulted in improved maps, allowing us to manually build the NTDs. Data were highly anisotropic, showing significantly lower intensity (I/\u03c3) and half\u2013set correlation (CC<sub>1/2</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Karplus and Diederichs, 2012</a>) along the c* axis than along a* and b* (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). For refinement, the high-resolution native dataset processed to 2.3 \u00c5 with XDS was submitted to the UCLA Diffraction Anisotropy Server (<a href=\"#bib65\">Strong et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/anisoscale/\">http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/anisoscale/</a>) for application of anisotropic cutoffs (2.3 \u00c5 along a* and b*, 3.2 \u00c5 along c*). The final model consists of six PCH-2 monomers, with a total of 2214 residues modeled out of 2544 (6 \u00d7 424 residues); the model displays good geometry with 98.05% of residues in favored, and 99.77% of residues in allowed Ramachandran space (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). All crystallographic software was installed and maintained through the SBGrid program (<a href=\"#bib44\">Morin et al., 2013</a>)."

All PCH-2/TRIP13 constructs showed a strong dependence on pH with almost undetectable activity at pH 7.0 and below, and full activity at pH 8.5\u20139.5. For assays measuring stimulation of ATPase activity by p31(comet) and MAD2, assays were performed at pH 7.5 where basal activity was lower but substrate stimulation was robust. The assayed concentration of each PCH-2/TRIP13 construct was adjusted between 0.5 and 20 \u03bcM monomer, for the most accurate measurement of ATPase activity, depending on the assay. For TRIP13, which adopts multiple oligomeric states in solution, we verified that the ATP hydrolysis rate varies linearly between 0.625 and 10 \u03bcM TRIP13 (monomer concentration) at both pH 7.5 and 8.5, indicating that the protein is predominantly hexameric (and thus fully active) in our ATPase assay conditions (data not shown). Unless otherwise indicated, TRIP13 was equimolar with added p31(comet) and MAD2 (judging by TRIP13 monomer concentration). The decline of NADH absorbance at 340 nm was measured using a TECAN (Mannedorf, Switzerland) Infinite M1000 spectrophotometer in 384-well microplates. NADH oxidation rate was calculated from a linear fit to each time course and converted to ATP hydrolysis rates.

There are two interesting new findings: a pronounced type of asymmetry in the PCH-2 (TRIP13 homolog) AAA+ ATPase \u2013 two of the subunits in the hexametric arrangement are bound to sulfate, two are apparently apo, and two are bound to ADP, resulting in large conformational differences between the \u201csmall\u201d subdomain of the AAA+ module."

However, there were some concerns about the interpretation and generality of the asymmetry observed in the crystal structure, and about the ATP hydrolysis experiments, as well as numerous suggestions on discussion of results from other groups on other systems."

There is a second interpretation, discussed by Mapelli et al. COSB 2007, in which O-MAD2 is seen as being more stable than empty (without a ligand) C-MAD2, but much less stable than ligand-bound C-MAD2. In this view, O-MAD2 is not a metastable state, but rather the stable state of MAD2 in the absence of a binding partner. The authors should consider that both the dimerization of MAD2 (even residual dimerization as in the R133A mutant) and the binding of C-MAD2 to p31comet (which they use in their assay) influence very dramatically the O-MAD2:C-MAD2 equilibrium, and that measuring the relative energy of these two states is therefore very complex. These considerations should probably reverberate also on the authors' discussion on the amount of ATP used for the conversion reaction. If a ligand (e.g. Cdc20) were bound to C-MAD2, the stability of C-MAD2 would be much higher and probably the amount of ATP required for the conversion would be correspondingly higher. My feeling is that the low ATP requirements reported by the authors are essentially due to the fact that the empty C-MAD2 substrate they use is much less stable than a C-MAD2 bound to a substrate, and that all the energy essentially goes in disrupting the considerable stabilization to the C-MAD2 conformation provided by p31comet."

The authors repeatedly emphasize that classic remodelers have a diverged mechanism for ATP-driven conformational changes, primarily due to the lack of a sensor-II Arg. However, to my knowledge there is no existing literature or strong data yet indicating a fundamental difference in mechanisms. Even the exact role of the sensor-II Arg is still unclear. Studies on Hsp104 suggested that the sensor-II Arg in NBD2 provides some extra nucleotide-binding energy but does not act to sense differences between nucleotides (Hattendorf and Lindquist, PNAS 99, 2002). In contrast, a sensor-II Arg mutation in ClpX allows normal ATP- or ADP binding but apparently prevents sensing of the nucleotide state (Joshi et al., NSMB 11, 2004)."

However, FtsH, a member of the classic clade of AAA+ enzymes, also crystallized as an asymmetric hexamer that resembled a dimer of trimers (Bieniossek et al., PNAS 103, 2006). There may be several different reasons why some AAA+ enzymes crystallize in 2-fold symmetric hexamers, like TRIP13/PCH-2 or ClpX, whereas others are more symmetric or have a continuous spiral staircase arrangement of subunits. As shown by EM studies in this manuscript, ATP binding can already significantly influence ring symmetry, and substrate binding in the central pore may induce additional changes in subunit arrangement or vertical registers. Even for ClpX, for which there are numerous structures and functional data both in bulk and at the single-molecule level, it remains unclear whether during substrate processing the hexamer maintains a 2-fold symmetry or adopts a conformation that contains a continuum of nucleotide states and a corresponding spiral staircase arrangement of pore-loops around the ring."

As indicated by the presented negative-stain EM as well as several previous studies on related AAA+ enzymes, ATP binding to the hexamer may significantly affect subunit conformations and ring topology.

The authors adopt an interpretation of the relative stability of O-MAD2 and C-MAD2 that is based on the studies of</i> <a href=\"#bib37\"><i>Luo et al. 2004</i></a><i>. There is a second interpretation, discussed by Mapelli et al. COSB 2007, in which O-MAD2 is seen as being more stable than empty (without a ligand) C-MAD2, but much less stable than ligand-bound C-MAD2. In this view, O-MAD2 is not a metastable state, but rather the stable state of MAD2 in the absence of a binding partner. The authors should consider that both the dimerization of MAD2 (even residual dimerization as in the R133A mutant) and the binding of C-MAD2 to p31comet (which they use in their assay) influence very dramatically the O-MAD2:C-MAD2 equilibrium, and that measuring the relative energy of these two states is therefore very complex. These considerations should probably reverberate also on the authors' discussion on the amount of ATP used for the conversion reaction. If a ligand (e.g. Cdc20) were bound to C-MAD2, the stability of C-MAD2 would be much higher and probably the amount of ATP required for the conversion would be correspondingly higher. My feeling is that the low ATP requirements reported by the authors are essentially due to the fact that the empty C-MAD2 substrate they use is much less stable than a C-MAD2 bound to a substrate, and that all the energy essentially goes in disrupting the considerable stabilization to the C-MAD2 conformation provided by p31comet</i>."

We incubated purified O-MAD2 or C-MAD2 24 hours at 37\u00b0C, then separated them by ion-exchange and quantified their relative levels. We find that both samples converge to \u223c15% O-MAD2 and \u223c85% C-MAD2 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that whatever the reason (dimerization, even residual dimerization as in MAD2<sup>R133A</sup>, could certainly promote conversion or at least stabilize the closed state), C-MAD2 is the preferred state in solution even in the absence of binding partners.

However, to my knowledge there is no existing literature or strong data yet indicating a fundamental difference in mechanisms. Even the exact role of the sensor-II Arg is still unclear. Studies on Hsp104 suggested that the sensor-II Arg in NBD2 provides some extra nucleotide-binding energy but does not act to sense differences between nucleotides (Hattendorf and Lindquist, PNAS 99, 2002).

Is not the case, however, that there is no observed stimulation of PCH-2/TRIP13 by p31(comet):MAD2 at pH 8.5; only that the stimulation factor is not as high. For example, a TRIP13 hexamer hydrolyzes \u223c2.5 ATP/min in the basal state versus \u223c11 when stimulated at pH 7.5 (4X stimulation), versus a basal rate of 9 ATP/min and stimulated rate of \u223c19 ATP/min at pH 8.5 (2X stimulation; not shown in manuscript). The stimulated rates at each pH also agree well with the basal rate of TRIP13 W221A (11 ATP/min at pH 7.5, 19 ATP/min at pH 8.5). We interpret these results as indicating that at pH 8.5, even without p31(comet):MAD2, PCH-2/TRIP13 is working closer to its maximum capacity than at pH 7.5, so the observed stimulation is lower as a result. We feel that the basal and stimulated ATPase rates measured at pH 7.5 are more relevant to the cellular context; however when initially characterizing these enzymes\u2019 ATPase rates and <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>/<i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub> values, we sought to maximize the enzyme\u2019s basal hydrolysis rate for easier characterization."
