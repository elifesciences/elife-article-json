However, it is unclear how this critical trait is acquired and regulated. We demonstrate that under the control of PPAR\u03b1, the genes required for lipid catabolism are transcribed before birth so that the neonatal liver has a prompt capacity to extract energy from milk upon suckling. The mechanism involves a fetal glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-PPAR\u03b1 axis in which GR directly regulates the transcriptional activation of PPAR\u03b1 by binding to its promoter. Certain PPAR\u03b1 target genes such as <i>Fgf21</i> remain repressed in the fetal liver and become PPAR\u03b1 responsive after birth following an epigenetic switch triggered by \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate-mediated inhibition of HDAC3. This study identifies an endocrine developmental axis in which fetal GR primes the activity of PPAR\u03b1 in anticipation of the sudden shifts in postnatal nutrient source and metabolic demands."
