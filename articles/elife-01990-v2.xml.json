It is generally unknown how complex bacterial structures such as PGNs are perceived by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and whether host hydrolytic activities facilitate decomposition of bacterial matrices and generation of soluble PRR ligands. Here we show that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, upon bacterial infection or exposure to microbial patterns, produces a metazoan lysozyme-like hydrolase (lysozyme 1, LYS1). LYS1 activity releases soluble PGN fragments from insoluble bacterial cell walls and cleavage products are able to trigger responses typically associated with plant immunity. Importantly, <i>LYS1</i> mutant genotypes exhibit super-susceptibility to bacterial infections similar to that observed on PGN receptor mutants. We propose that plants employ hydrolytic activities for the decomposition of complex bacterial structures, and that soluble pattern generation might aid PRR-mediated immune activation in cell layers adjacent to infection sites."

It is generally unknown how complex bacterial structures such as PGNs are perceived by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and whether host hydrolytic activities facilitate decomposition of bacterial matrices and generation of soluble PRR ligands. Here we show that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, upon bacterial infection or exposure to microbial patterns, produces a metazoan lysozyme-like hydrolase (lysozyme 1, LYS1). LYS1 activity releases soluble PGN fragments from insoluble bacterial cell walls and cleavage products are able to trigger responses typically associated with plant immunity. Importantly, <i>LYS1</i> mutant genotypes exhibit super-susceptibility to bacterial infections similar to that observed on PGN receptor mutants. We propose that plants employ hydrolytic activities for the decomposition of complex bacterial structures, and that soluble pattern generation might aid PRR-mediated immune activation in cell layers adjacent to infection sites."

Bacteria-derived PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or flagellins possess immunity-stimulating activities in metazoans and plants, suggesting that the ability to sense bacterial surface structures and mount immunity is conserved across lineage borders (<a href=\"#bib60\">N\u00fcrnberger et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boller and Felix, 2009</a>)."

Structurally, PGNs are heteroglycan chains that are composed of polymeric alternating \u03b2(1,4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residues (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schleifer and Kandler, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Glauner et al., 1988</a>). Such chains are interconnected by oligopeptide bridges which form a coordinate meshwork, thereby providing structural integrity to the bacterial envelope. Recognition of different PGN substructures in animal hosts is brought about by structurally diverse PRRs such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins (NODs), peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs/PGLYRPs), scavenger receptors, or Toll-like receptor TLR2 (<a href=\"#bib78\">Strober et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Royet and Dziarski, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">M\u00fcller-Anstett et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Magalhaes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kurata, 2014</a>). In plants, a tripartite PGN recognition system at the plasma membrane of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with shared functions in PGN sensing and transmembrane signaling was recently described (<a href=\"#bib86\">Willmann et al., 2011</a>). This system comprises Lysin motif (LysM) domain proteins LYM1 and LYM3 for PGN ligand binding and the transmembrane LysM receptor kinase CERK1 that is likely required for conveying the extracellular signal across the plasma membrane and for initiating intracellular signal transduction. All three proteins were shown to be indispensable for PGN sensitivity and to contribute to immunity to bacterial infection (<a href=\"#bib86\">Willmann et al., 2011</a>), which is in agreement with their proposed role as a PGN sensor system. More recently, a similar PGN perception system made of LysM domain proteins LYP4 and LYP6 has been reported from rice (<a href=\"#bib50\">Liu et al., 2012a</a>)."

                        "text": "Microbial patterns such as bacterial PGN, LPS, flagellin, or fungal chitin harbor immunogenic epitopes that are parts of supramolecular structures building microbial surfaces (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boller and Felix, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kumar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Newman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Pel and Pieterse, 2013</a>). It is therefore assumed that recognition by host PRRs most likely requires the presence of soluble, randomly structured ligands derived from a complex matrix. X-ray structure-based insight into the binding of bacterial flagellin to the Arabidopsis receptor complex FLS2/BAK1 or of fungal chitin to the Arabidopsis receptor CERK1 supports this view (<a href=\"#bib87\">Willmann and N\u00fcrnberger, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Liu et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the existence of fungal LysM effector proteins that scavenge soluble chitin fragments, thus preventing recognition by plant PRRs, suggests that mechanisms releasing these soluble fragments from fungal cell walls must exist (<a href=\"#bib23\">de Jonge et al., 2010</a>). Most often, however, it is an open question whether soluble ligand presentation to eukaryotic host PRRs is the result of spontaneous decomposition of the microbial extracellular matrix during infection or, alternatively, whether host-derived factors contribute to the generation of immunogenic ligands for PRR activation. For example, only monomers of bacterial flagellin induce immune responses through human TLR5 whereas filamentous flagella, in which the immunogenic flagellin structure is buried and thus is not accessible to TLR5, do not (<a href=\"#bib76\">Smith et al., 2003</a>). It was proposed that a number of circumstances cause flagellin monomer release from intact flagella. For instance, <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> deliberately ejects its flagellum once it is no longer required for the bacterial life cycle (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jenal and Stephens, 2002</a>). Moreover, during infection, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> produces rhamnolipids which act as surfactants and cause flagellin shedding from intact flagella, resulting in a more pronounced immune response (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gerstel et al., 2009</a>). Alternatively, host factors such as proteases or environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, or bile salts have been proposed to mediate shearing of flagella from bacterial surfaces (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ramos et al., 2004</a>). Likewise, recognition of PGN by intracellular receptors, such as mammalian NOD1 and NOD2, or by plasma membrane receptors, such as mammalian TLR2 or plant LYM1, LYM3 and CERK1 (<a href=\"#bib56\">M\u00fcller-Anstett et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Sorbara and Philpott, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Willmann et al., 2011</a>), is facilitated by soluble ligands. Animal lysozymes have been implicated in PGN hydrolysis, bacterial lysis, and host immunity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Callewaert and Michiels, 2010</a>), probably through partial PGN degradation and generation of soluble ligands for PGN sensors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cho et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Davis et al., 2011</a>)."

We here describe a plant enzyme activity (LYS1) that hydrolyzes \u03b2(1,4) linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in PGN and between N-acetylglucosamine residues in chitooligosaccharides, thus closely resembling metazoan lysozymes (EC 3.2.1.17). Importantly, PGN breakdown products produced by LYS1 are immunogenic in plants, and <i>LYS1</i> mutant genotypes were immunocompromised upon bacterial infection. Our findings suggest that plant enzymatic activities, such as LYS1, are capable of generating soluble PRR ligands that might contribute to the activation of immune responses in cells at and surrounding the site of their generation. We also infer that eukaryotic hosts more generally make concerted use of PGN hydrolytic activities and of PRRs in order to cope with bacterial infections."

As some metazoan PGRPs harbor PGN-degrading enzyme activities (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gelius et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Wang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bischoff et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kurata, 2010</a>), we tested whether recombinant Arabidopsis PGN binding proteins LYM1 and LYM3 were able to catalyze PGN degradation. For this, we have employed a standard lysozyme assay (<a href=\"#bib62\">Park et al., 2002</a>) that is based on reduced turbidity in suspensions of Gram-positive <i>Micrococcus luteus</i> cell wall preparations due to PGN degradation. PGN-degrading activity of hen egg-white lysozyme served as a positive control in these assays. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lysozyme, but not recombinant LYM1 or LYM3, displayed cell wall-degrading lytic activity, suggesting that the latter are unable to release PGN fragments from bacterial cell walls. This is in agreement with a lack of sequence similarities between LYM1 or LYM3 and known metazoan PGN hydrolytic activities. We therefore conclude that LYM1 and LYM3 constitute plant PGN sensors that appear to be functionally related to non-enzymatic mammalian or Drosophila PGRPs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cho et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bischoff et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kurata, 2010</a>)."

As an alternative to knock-out lines, <i>LYS1</i> knock-down lines (<i>LYS1</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup>) were produced by artificial micro RNA technology (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schwab et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). As proven by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we obtained two genetically independent <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup> lines with residual transcript levels not exceeding 10% of those detected in wild-type plants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In contrast, the transcription of potential off-target genes was not affected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Protein extracts derived from transgenic plants were tested for chitinolytic activity by employing 4-methylumbelliferyl \u03b2-D-N, N\u2032, N\u2033-triacetylchitotriose (4-MUCT) as substrate. Leaf protein extracts from <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>OE</i></sup> plants exhibited significant chitinase activity when compared with a <i>Streptomyces griseus</i> chitinase control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, wild-type and <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup> plants exhibited only marginal chitinase activities.

To confirm this localization we prepared apoplastic washes from <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>OE</i></sup> Arabidopsis lines. Both the LYS1-GFP fusion protein as well as free LYS1 was detectable in concentrated apoplastic fluids whereas the cytoplasmic mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK3 was only present in the total leaf protein samples (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, transient expression in the heterologous plant system <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> of the <i>p35S::LYS1-GFP</i> construct resulted in labeling of the cell periphery, whereas expression of a construct lacking the <i>LYS1</i> signal peptide-encoding sequence yielded labeling of intracellular structures (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Use of the fluorescent dye FM4-64, a plasma membrane and early endosome marker (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bolte et al., 2004</a>), revealed that LYS1 signals co-localized to a large extent with the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, LYS1 likely operates in close vicinity of the plant surface. Indeed, previous identification within the Arabidopsis cell wall proteome (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kwon et al., 2005</a>) suggests that LYS1 acts in the plant apoplast. Since the plant apoplast is an acidic compartment (pH 5\u20136) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Schulte et al., 2006</a>), we investigated whether LYS1 is active at physiologically relevant pH conditions. For this, the <i>M. luteus</i> cell wall-degrading activity of an <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>OE</i></sup> leaf extract was determined at different pH values. Although active at pH values ranging from 3.2 to 7.2, a pronounced maximum of LYS1 activity was detected around pH 6 which coincided with the apoplastic pH of plant cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

First, supernatants of PGN preparations treated with either native or heat-denatured LYS1 were used to trigger immune marker gene <i>FRK1</i> expression in Arabidopsis seedlings. Importantly, only supernatants from PGN digests produced by native LYS1 or mutanolysin induced <i>FRK1</i> expression whereas buffer controls or digests produced by heat-inactivated LYS1 did not release immunogenic soluble fragments from complex PGNs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Notably, activation of immune responses by LYS1-generated PGN fragments was dependent on Arabidopsis PGN receptor complex components LYM1, LYM3, and CERK1 as the respective mutant genotypes failed to respond to immunogenic PGN fragments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Second, we tested whether LYS1-generated PGN fragments were able to trigger an immunity-associated response, medium alkalinization, in rice cell suspensions. This plant was chosen for testing as a PGN receptor system very similar to that in Arabidopsis has recently been reported (<a href=\"#bib50\">Liu et al., 2012a</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, LYS1-released PGN fragments triggered medium alkalinization in cultured rice cells, suggesting that immune defense stimulation by soluble PGN fragments is not restricted to Arabidopsis only."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, release of immunogenic PGN fragments into solution occurred rapidly within 10 min of incubation with native LYS1. Incubation of complex PGNs with LYS1 yielded the highest immunogenic activity of the digest supernatant after 30 min, suggesting that at that time point the maximum amount of immunogenic PGN fragments was generated. However, prolonged incubation with LYS1 again resulted in a loss of activity with overnight digestion completely abolishing stimulatory activity of the PGN digest. We assume that LYS1 is capable of releasing immunogenic fragments from complex PGNs, but extensive or complete digest into PGN monomers or small PGN fragments appears to abolish the immunogenic activity of PGN fragments. This result is in accordance with our previous observations that prolonged digestion of PGN with mutanolysin diminishes its defense-inducing activity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gust et al., 2007</a>)."

As LYS1 harbors chitinase activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A,B and 5B</a>) and as <i>LYS1</i> transcripts accumulate upon fungal infection (<a href=\"#bib69a\">Samac and Shah, 1991</a>), we first analyzed the role of LYS1 in immunity towards fungal infection. Leaves of transgenic <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>OE</i></sup> or <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup> lines and wild-type plants were infected with the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and disease symptoms were monitored 2\u20133 days post infection. Fungal hyphal growth and necrotic leaf lesions at infection sites were detectable in all plant lines tested and hyphal outgrowth or cell death lesion sizes revealed no differences between wild-type, <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>OE</i></sup> or <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup> lines (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Likewise, infection with the necrotrophic fungus <i>Alternaria brassicicola</i> resulted in indistinguishable necrotic lesions in <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>OE</i></sup> and <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup> transgenics compared to those observed in wild-type control plants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Trypan blue staining and microscopic analysis of the infection sites did not reveal major differences in fungal hyphal growth among all lines tested (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Although disease indices at day 11 after infection were slightly increased in <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup> lines (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), such subtle differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, we failed to detect a role for LYS1 in immunity to fungal infection with <i>B. cinerea</i> and <i>A. brassicicola</i> under our experimental conditions. However, these results cannot be generalized and LYS1 might still have a role under infection regimes other than the ones used here or it might be important for defense against other fungal pathogens."

This holds true for bacterial PGNs, but also for other patterns including bacterial LPS, flagellin, or fungus-derived chitin or glucan structures, all of which have been ascribed triggers of innate immunity in metazoans and plants (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boller and Felix, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kumar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Newman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Pel and Pieterse, 2013</a>). Limited insight into the 3D structure of ligand\u2013PRR complexes, as well as knowledge on ligand structural requirements for plant immune activation, suggests that small ligand epitopes are crucial for binding to host PRRs (<a href=\"#bib51\">Liu et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Sun et al., 2013</a>).

First, during bacterial multiplication and cell wall biogenesis, large portions of soluble PGN fragments are shed into the extracytoplasmic space from which only 50\u201390% are recycled (<a href=\"#bib61\">Park and Uehara, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Reith and Mayer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>). This implies that imperfect recycling of bacterial walls might serve as a source of soluble ligands for host PRRs sensing PGN (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boudreau et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Wyckoff et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, muramylpeptides spontaneously shed by <i>Shigella flexneri</i> directly stimulate NOD1-dependent immune responses in mammalian immune cells, and bacterial mutants impaired in PGN recycling hyperactivate host immunity (<a href=\"#bib59\">Nigro et al., 2008</a>). Second, host lysozyme activity has been demonstrated to generate soluble PGN ligands for NOD2 receptor-mediated immune activation and clearance of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> colonization in mice (<a href=\"#bib13\">Callewaert and Michiels, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Clarke and Weiser, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Davis et al., 2011</a>). Importantly, <a href=\"#bib22\">Davis et al. (2011)</a> established a role for host lysozymes in PGN release from bacteria in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. Likewise, Drosophila Gram-negative bacteria-derived binding protein 1 (GNBP1) was shown to possess PGN-hydrolyzing activity and to deliver fragmented PGN to the PGN sensor, PGRP-SA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Filipe et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Wang et al., 2006</a>). Thus, both passive and active mechanisms of PGN decomposition appear to occur simultaneously during host pathogen encounters and might not be mutually exclusive."

LYS1 has been demonstrated to hydrolyze \u03b2(1,4) linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in PGN and between N-acetylglucosamine residues in chitin oligomers, thus closely resembling metazoan lysozymes. LYS1-generated fragments trigger immunity-associated responses in a PGN receptor-dependent manner. Activation of defenses has been further shown to occur in the two plants (Arabidopsis and rice) for which PGN perception systems have been described to date (<a href=\"#bib86\">Willmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Liu et al., 2012a</a>). Importantly, Arabidopsis plants with strongly reduced <i>LYS1</i> expression were impaired in immunity to bacterial infection, suggesting strongly that LYS1 function is an important element of the immune system of this plant. Notably, immunocompromised phenotypes in <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup> plants were comparable to those observed in either <i>lym1 lym3</i> or <i>cerk1</i> PGN receptor mutant genotypes (<a href=\"#bib86\">Willmann et al., 2011</a>). We further found that plants overexpressing LYS1 were also susceptible to bacterial infections, suggesting that defined LYS1 levels in wild-type plants are required for LYS1 immune function. The most compelling explanation for this phenotype is that PGN hyperdegradation (in <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>OE</i></sup> plants) or lack of PGN degradation (in <i>LYS</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup> mutants) are equally disadvantageous to plant immunity and that immune activation in Arabidopsis requires oligomeric PGN fragments of a particular minimum degree of polymerization (DP). This view is supported by our findings that prolonged digestion of PGN by LYS1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) or by mutanolysin (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gust et al., 2007</a>) abolished the immunogenic activity of PGN. Likewise, immunogenic activities of fungal chitin or oomycete glucans have been reported to require defined minimum ligand sizes with a minimum DP of &gt;5 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cheong et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>). We therefore propose that <i>LYS1</i> overexpression might result in PGN fragments of insufficient size, thereby mimicking the physiological status in <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>KD</i></sup> mutants lacking major PGN hydrolytic activities."

While it is often not entirely clear how these enzymes contribute to plant immunity, it is widely assumed that this is due to microcidal activities of these proteins. In our study we have shown that Arabidopsis LYS1 cleaves O-glycosidic bonds formed between GlcNAc (indicative of chitinolytic activity) as well as those formed between GlcNAc and MurNAc (indicative of peptidoglycanolytic activity). However, we have been unable to demonstrate any deleterious effect of LYS1 overexpression on fungal infections, suggesting that <i>B. cinerea</i> and <i>A. brassicicola</i> at least are not affected by LYS1 function. Likewise, we have been unable to demonstrate direct bactericidal activity of LYS1 to <i>P. syringae</i> (not shown), suggesting that the positive role of LYS1 in plant immunity to bacterial infection is not due to its direct inhibitory effect on bacterial fitness. This view is further supported by the fact that <i>LYS1</i><sup><i>OE</i></sup> plants with strongly enhanced PGN hydrolytic activity do not exhibit enhanced immunity to <i>Pseudomonas</i> infections but become hypersusceptible to infection (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). We cannot rule out at this point LYS1-mediated bacterial lysis, which would likely also result in the release of immunogenic PGN fragments. We would like to emphasize, however, that our findings are in agreement with a predominant role of LYS1 in the generation of PGN fragments that subsequently can trigger plant immunity via PRRs. Hence, plant LYS1 functionally resembles recently described mammalian lysozymes that were shown to generate soluble PGN fragments for PGN receptor NOD2, thereby mediating immunity to <i>S. pneumoniae</i> infection in mice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Davis et al., 2011</a>)."

It is possible that the pathogen-inducible later increase in LYS1 activity could have further roles for generating diffusible signals that might serve innate immune activation, not only in cells that are directly in contact with invading microbes but also in cell layers adjacent to infection sites."

Complex glucans constitute major constituents of various <i>Phytophthora</i> species, many of which are plant pathogens (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kroon et al., 2011</a>).

LYS1 constitutes the first plant lysozyme-type activity for which a role in host immunity has been established. LYS1 is capable of generating immunogenic fragments from complex PGNs, which themselves serve as ligands for the LYM1-LYM3-CERK1-PGN recognition complex in Arabidopsis. It is noteworthy that LYM1 and LYM3 are PGN recognition proteins that lack apparent intrinsic PGN-degrading activity. We conclude that metazoans and plants employ hydrolytic activities for the decomposition of bacterial PGNs during host immune activation. In addition to the established role of PGNs in pattern-triggered immune activation, host-mediated degradation of bacterial PGNs constitutes another conserved feature of innate immunity in both lineages. However, as the molecular components involved differ structurally among phyla, both facets of PGN-mediated immunity might have evolved convergently."

The histochemical detection of \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) enzyme activity in whole leaves of <i>pLYS1::GUS</i> or <i>pPR-1::GUS</i> transgenic Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib75\">Shapiro and Zhang, 2001</a>) was determined as described earlier (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gust et al., 2007</a>). For the measurement of extracellular pH, 300 \u00b5l of cultured rice cells were transferred to 48 well plates and equilibrated at 150 rpm for 30 min. After addition of elicitors, the pH in the cell culture was monitored with an InLab Micro electrode (Mettler Toledo, Gie\u00dfen, Germany)."

Recombinant LYS1 is not active, so they overexpress LYS1-GFP in plants and use this as a source for enzyme to characterize. They also characterize the overexpression plants and knockdowns. The biochemical effects are for the most part convincing but might be more so if they were presented as specific activities with some kinetic analyses that were compared with the known enzymes they use. A major finding is that the plants with OE and KD seem to have the same phenotypes with respect to hypersusceptibility to <i>P. syringae</i> and lack of MAMP response (at least FRK1 expression) with PGN treatment.

Therefore, it\u2019s especially important to do the correct statistical analysis. The effect of the KD would be more convincing if we had conditions where the level of protein in WT can be detected (or maybe one of the bands in D in the Col lane is right?). Did the authors try using apoplast washes to enrich for the activity? How about inducing conditions (e.g. MAMP treatment?) Since LYS expression is normally PAMP-induced, it is important to show that a PAMP-induced increase in PGN-degrading activity is decreased in extracts from <i>LYS1-KD</i> lines, when compared to extracts from WT plants."

If this were the case, it would change the interpretation of the experiments. Some lines where the overexpression is more modest would be helpful for determining if increased resistance can be achieved. In any case with <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8.C</a>, the authors should check the kinetics to see if there is a time point at which the response of OE is faster/higher than WT."

They show that over-expression lines have the same phenotype, with regard to bacterial virulence, as the silenced lines. This is not due to co-suppression since the authors measured significant levels of both mRNA and protein levels in these over-expression lines. In the Discussion, the authors postulate that higher levels of LYS1 results in a more extensive hydrolysis of the PGN resulting in the loss of the correct sized fragment for induction of innate immunity. This seems a reasonable hypothesis but one that requires experimental validation. This requires the use of a quantitative assay for the immune response that can be followed over time. There are many such relatively easy assays that could be used, such as ROS production or gene expression. The authors should test whether the <i>LYS1</i> OE and KD lines differ in their temporal response to both PGN and bacterial inoculation using such assays. If their hypothesis is correct, then one might predict that the OE lines would show some response very early but this would decline rapidly as the elicitor is completely hydrolyzed. One might also predict, for example, that adding higher levels of PGN elicitor might elicit a response on the OE lines (i.e., one might be able to saturate the enzyme and slow hydrolysis to the point where elicitation can be measured)."

For this, the authors should transiently express a catalytically-inactive variant of LYS1 (based on the knowledge on similar enzymes in other kingdoms) and compare the PGN-degrading activity of the corresponding extract when compared to an extract from leaves over-expressing WT LYS1."

This is not due to co-suppression since the authors measured significant levels of both mRNA and protein levels in these over-expression lines. In the Discussion, the authors postulate that higher levels of LYS1 results in a more extensive hydrolysis of the PGN resulting in the loss of the correct sized fragment for induction of innate immunity. This seems a reasonable hypothesis but one that requires experimental validation. This requires the use of a quantitative assay for the immune response that can be followed over time. There are many such relatively easy assays that could be used, such as ROS production or gene expression. The authors should test whether the</i> LYS1 <i>OE and KD lines differ in their temporal response to both PGN and bacterial inoculation using such assays. If their hypothesis is correct, then one might predict that the OE lines would show some response very early but this would decline rapidly as the elicitor is completely hydrolyzed.
