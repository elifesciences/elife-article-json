To us it is pleasing to the soul; to the birds it is crucial for successful mating. Young male birds learn these songs by imitating a male tutor, usually their father, and the songs can be modified in adulthood in response to auditory feedback. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Richard Mooney and colleagues at Duke University\u2014including Kosuke Hamaguchi and Katherine Tschida as joint first authors\u2014address the important question of how the sounds that birds hear influence the sounds that birds make (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hamaguchi et al., 2014</a>). The findings have broader implications for our understanding of how sensory feedback is assimilated into complex motor programs in the brain, like learning to play a tune on the piano."

Because HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons have both motor and sensory responses, and because they are connected to the anterior forebrain pathway, HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons are a natural place to look when investigating how auditory feedback can alter song output. Previous studies have shown that the spiking activity (recorded with extracellular methods) of HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons is not altered when birds are exposed to a distorted version of their own singing. Given that HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons appear to be responsible for all auditory responses in the anterior forebrain pathway, this result seemed puzzling."

However, painstaking recording and analysis did not reveal any alterations, suggesting that the HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons \u2018ignore\u2019 the distorted signals during singing. Although the hypothesis was disproven, this result is remarkable because these same neurons responded to auditory signals when the bird listened without singing. The Duke group also showed that changes in subthreshold potential in HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons preceded song syllable onsets by tens of milliseconds, providing further evidence that synaptic inputs onto HVCx neurons convey motor-related signals during singing (<a href=\"#bib6\">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Prather et al., 2008</a>). Mooney and co-workers therefore conclude that singing shuts off all auditory input to the HVC<sub>X</sub> cells while still allowing motor signals to reach the AFP."

To explore this question the Duke team reopened the issue of how deafening (by removal of the cochlea) leads to atrophy of the inputs to HVC<sub>X</sub> neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Tschida and Mooney 2012</a>). This involved performing elegant in vivo imaging of single dendritic spines: dendrites are the long processes that extend from the body of a nerve cell, and spines are small needle-like structures that extend from the dendrites and receive synaptic inputs from other cells. Previously, lesion studies have shown that LMAN is required for the degradation of song that follows when deafening is used to remove auditory feedback (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brainard and Doupe 2000</a>), and later it was shown that such deafening also causes atrophy of the spines on HVCx neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Tschida and Mooney, 2012</a>). These observations led Mooney and co-workers to ask whether post-deafening spine changes were solely driven by direct inputs to HVC that convey auditory signals, or instead required signals from LMAN. It was found that damage to LMAN prevented deafening-induced changes in HVC<sub>X</sub> neuron spines."

A key challenge, therefore, is to determine how error information enters the anterior forebrain pathway. Mooney and co-workers suggest that dopamine signals from the midbrain are a likely candidate as they provide direct input to the anterior forebrain pathway without passing through HVC."

Activity in these circuits is both sensory and motor in nature, and sensory influences on neural activity can change dramatically across behavioural conditions. Studies such as this one by Mooney, Hamaguchi, Tschida and co-workers, which combine detailed functional analyses of identified cell classes with real-time manipulations of feedback, can reveal how complex interactions between sensory and motor signals shape the structure and function of the nervous system."
