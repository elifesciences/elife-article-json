The molecular basis of this extremophile phenotype, involving strain isolates with a 3-4 order of magnitude increase in IR resistance at 3000 Gy, is now addressed. Of 69 mutations identified in one of our most highly adapted isolates, functional experiments demonstrate that the IR resistance phenotype is almost entirely accounted for by only three of these nucleotide changes, in the DNA metabolism genes <i>recA</i>, <i>dnaB</i>, and <i>yfjK</i>. Four additional genetic changes make small but measurable contributions. Whereas multiple contributions to IR resistance are evident in this study, our results highlight a particular adaptation mechanism not adequately considered in studies to date: Genetic innovations involving pre-existing DNA repair functions can play a predominant role in the acquisition of an IR resistance phenotype."

The molecular basis of this extremophile phenotype, involving strain isolates with a 3-4 order of magnitude increase in IR resistance at 3000 Gy, is now addressed. Of 69 mutations identified in one of our most highly adapted isolates, functional experiments demonstrate that the IR resistance phenotype is almost entirely accounted for by only three of these nucleotide changes, in the DNA metabolism genes <i>recA</i>, <i>dnaB</i>, and <i>yfjK</i>. Four additional genetic changes make small but measurable contributions. Whereas multiple contributions to IR resistance are evident in this study, our results highlight a particular adaptation mechanism not adequately considered in studies to date: Genetic innovations involving pre-existing DNA repair functions can play a predominant role in the acquisition of an IR resistance phenotype."

The experiments were performed on populations of <i>E. coli</i> cells that had been subjected to an evolutionary selection for extremely high resistance to ionizing radiation. This involved exposing the <i>E. coli</i> cells to ionizing radiation that killed most of the population, and then growing up the survivors. Many repetitions of this process led to a population of cells with a resistance that was comparable to that of the bacterium <i>D. radiodurans.</i> The same evolution experiment was carried out four times, generating four separate populations of bacteria that were resistant to ionizing radiation."

Then the mutations that had the largest positive effects on resistance to ionizing radiation were combined. Introducing particular mutations into three DNA repair genes resulted in the highest aggregate levels of resistance. Finally, evolved <i>E. coli</i> cells that were already resistant were made more sensitive to radiation by repairing the same individual mutations. Again, the biggest change was observed with the DNA repair genes. Indeed, repairing the mutations in just the three DNA repair genes completely removed the radiation resistance."

The study of organisms with extreme resistance to IR has received increasing attention as a potential source of mechanistic insights that might permit the modulation of IR resistance in cells. <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>, which can absorb IR doses in excess of 5 kGy without lethality (over 1000 times the lethal dose for humans), has become a key model organism for understanding this phenotype (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cox and Battista, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Blasius et al., 2008</a>). Mainly through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), IR can lead to the damage of protein, DNA, and all other cellular macromolecules (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sonntag Cv, 2005</a>). Ongoing research into the molecular basis of extreme IR resistance has suggested three potential classes of mechanisms. These are (A) a condensed nucleoid structure, which could potentially facilitate DNA repair processes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zimmerman and Battista, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">Levin-Zaidman et al., 2003</a>), (B) an enhanced capacity for amelioration of protein damage, which could protect DNA repair systems and make them more readily available following irradiation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daly, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">Daly, 2009</a>), and (C) potential specialized pathways for DNA repair (<a href=\"#bib37\">Zahradka et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Cox and Battista, 2005</a>)."

Increases in cytosolic antioxidant capacity, particularly an increase in the cellular Mn/Fe ratio (<a href=\"#bib11\">Daly et al., 2004</a>), appear to make the major contributions. Increasing the Mn/Fe ratio limits the Fenton chemistry that produces ROS (<a href=\"#bib21\">Krisko and Radman, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">Daly, 2012</a>). The hypothesis that the condensed nucleoid of <i>Deinococcus</i> facilitates efficient DNA repair has been questioned, since the presence of condensed nucleoids does not correlate reliably with radiation resistance in bacterial species (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zimmerman and Battista, 2005</a>)."

However, the constellation of DNA repair functions in <i>D. radiodurans</i> is unremarkable by bacterial standards. <i>D. radiodurans</i> and other IR resistant species appear to have approximately the same toolbox of DNA repair pathways as non-resistant species. Thus, the argument has been advanced that specialized DNA repair plays little or no role in IR resistance (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daly, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2009</a>). Instead, antioxidants prevent protein oxidation and render the classical DNA repair systems more readily available to correct the effects of IR."

In brief, we carried out 20 rounds of selection, with each round consisting of IR exposure sufficient to kill \u223c99% of the population, followed by outgrowth. The experiment was carried out four times, generating four separately evolved populations (IR-1-20, IR-2-20, IR-3-20, and IR-4-20). In the evolved populations, survival at 3000 Gy was typically increased by 3\u20134 orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harris et al., 2009</a>). We reported genomic sequences from seven isolates of IR-1-20, one from IR-2-20, and one from IR-3-20. Genetic alterations in the evolved strains were quite numerous (within the range of 40\u201380 per isolate), suggesting a complex and somewhat variable pattern of genetic innovation. None of the isolates in that study had mutator phenotypes relative to the Founder strain, although it is possible that mutators appear and thrive in the various populations for periods during the many cycles of selection (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harris et al., 2009</a>). An approximately fivefold variation in levels of resistance to IR was evident in a screen of 62 separate isolates from population IR-1-20 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harris et al., 2009</a>)."

The results reveal multiple contributions to IR resistance as well as the detailed molecular basis of the phenotype in one isolate."

We note that IR resistance in this more highly evolved population (IR-CB1000-30) was impossible to measure accurately. The cells in this population grew more slowly than the Founder, but growth continued during irradiation at 6 Gy/min (John R Battista, unpublished data).

The deletion of occurs early, within the first three rounds of selection for IR resistance (EA Wood and JR Battista, unpublished data), and it makes a significant contribution (an approximately 10-fold increase in survival at 3000 Gy) to the overall IR resistance phenotype (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harris et al., 2009</a>)."

Outside of the e14 deletion, there are no mutations shared by all seven of the IR-1-20 isolates. There are three groupings of mutations in subsets of the clonal isolates that reflect clonal interference (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gerrish and Lenski, 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">Perron et al., 2012</a>,<a href=\"#bib34\">Rozen et al., 2002</a>) in this population (JR Battista, unpublished results). In contrast, isolates from the IR-2-20 and IR-3-20 populations each exhibit a number of mutations (23 in IR-2-20 and 30 in IR-3-20) that are present in all seven isolates from their respective populations, and are effectively fixed. The apparent fixation of a mutation in one of these populations may reflect its importance to the phenotype. Alternatively, this may reflect a genetic bottleneck at some stage in the evolution of these populations, and speaks to the close relationship of the isolates."

Application of the second criterion requires data that was unavailable in our earlier study (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harris et al., 2009</a>), and provides a pattern implicating a particular mutation in the acquisition of an extreme IR resistance phenotype. This criterion also assumes that there is a significant level of phenotypic parallelism (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hindre et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">Futuyama, 1986</a>) between the independently evolved populations. <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> summarizes the results of applying these criteria, with nine altered genes or systems meeting these two criteria.

Second, it is particularly well characterized (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harris et al., 2009</a>; and this study). Third, it was isolated from a population that lacks any sign of clonal interference, allowing us to focus on patterns present in a relatively simple population. Finally, the patterns of mutations we highlight below overlap patterns that are evident in other populations, making CB2000 a good barometer of mechanisms by which radiation resistance evolved in many of our strains.

For <i>wcaK</i> and <i>glpD</i>, this increase in resistance is similar to the resistance observed in Founder \u0394e14 strains carrying the point mutations in these genes, suggesting that the mutations result in loss of function. The twofold increase in resistance conferred by a <i>gsiB</i> deletion is less than that of the <i>gsiB</i> point mutation, suggesting a more complex situation. The situation with <i>yfjK</i> is similar. Founder \u0394e14 \u0394<i>yfjK</i> cells are 13-fold more resistant than the isogenic parent strain as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>. However, the Founder \u0394e14 strain encoding YfjK A151D is an additional 10-fold more resistant than the deletion, and nearly 2 orders of magnitude more resistant than Founder \u0394e14. It is possible that the mutation in <i>yfjK</i> is a partial loss of function, or that it eliminates one or more activities of the YfjK protein but not all of them. The effects of the <i>yfjK</i> deletion also suggests that this gene affects a process that is distinct in some manner from that affected by the <i>recA</i> and <i>dnaB</i> genes. Deletion of <i>recA</i> or <i>dnaB</i> results in slightly reduced growth or viability, or no viability, respectively, even without IR exposure."

It is possible that this complex is essential for the elimination of proteins that have been inactivated by oxidative carbonylation. A mutation in <i>fnr</i> is fixed in IR-3-20.

Transcription of the entire fimbrial operon is increased in CB1000, possibly due to phase variation of the <i>fimS</i> region, but in CB2000, only the <i>fimC</i> gene exhibits an increase in transcription of more than 1.5-fold. In both evolved strains <i>icd</i> (b4519) transcript levels are increased, likely due to the excision of the e14 prophage, which reconstitutes the <i>icd</i> gene with a different 3\u2032 end of the gene containing 2 base substitutions.

Although classical DNA repair systems may be shared widely in different IR resistant and IR sensitive bacterial species, those DNA repair systems are biologically malleable. Classical DNA repair pathways can adapt to facilitate more efficient repair when cells are exposed to high levels of IR. In our evolved isolates, adaptations to DNA repair, involving genetic alterations in well-studied enzymes that are present in most bacterial species, represent a substantial and sometimes the dominant adaptation that contributes to the IR resistance phenotype.

In brief, the altered RecA proteins nucleate filament formation more rapidly and extend those filaments more slowly than the wild-type protein, leading to larger numbers of shorter filaments. Those same proteins function better as shorter filaments, and are less sensitive to inhibition by ADP.

We used Illumina-based next generation sequencing that typically generates very low error levels in bacterial genome sequencing. SNP calls required their presence in at least three reads. Typically, the SNPs were based on 50\u2013150 reads. To estimate error levels, the sequence alignments for one dataset (CB2004) were examined manually. Since this is a haploid genome, loci which contained multiple alleles (a mixture or reference and \u2018variant\u2019 alleles) are indications of alignment errors or sequence specific errors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nakamura et al., 2011</a>) and were not called as SNPs No false positives were identified in the manual examination and we estimate their appearance at rates of &lt;2%. If reads can be aligned to multiple locations in the genome, their exact placement is ambiguous and assigned a map quality score of zero (MQ = 0). It is not possible to call SNPs in regions that contain only MQ = 0 reads and false negative calls are potentially present. Approximately, 100,000 bp of the genome was covered by only MQ = 0 reads, and thus the potential for false negatives extends over about 2.2% of the genome."

After growth overnight, competition cultures were started by inoculating 10 ml fresh LB broth with 35 \u03bcl of competition <i>Ara</i>+ and Ara<sup>\u2212</sup>strains in 125 ml flasks and grown at 37\u00b0C with shaking until an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of \u223c0.2 was reached. Each competition culture was incubated on ice for 5 min before a 1 ml sample was transferred to an eppendorf tube and irradiated in a Mark I <sup>137</sup>Cs irradiator (from JL Shepherd and Associates, San Fernando, CA) for a time corresponding to 2 kGy and 3 kGy (\u223c7 Gy/min). Irradiated samples were diluted appropriately, and plated on TA plates to determine the total number of surviving red and white colony forming units. A non-irradiated control sample for each competition culture was diluted and plated to determine the titer of each culture and the percent Ara+ vs Ara<sup>\u2212</sup>cells before irradiation. For each competition, three biological replicates were carried out. Percent survival was calculated by dividing the titer of the surviving population by the titer of the non-irradiated control sample, for both <i>Ara</i>+ and Ara<sup>\u2212</sup>strains. Selection rate, r, also referred to as log(advantage), was calculated as log(N<sub>1(IR)</sub>)/(N<sub>1(No-IR)</sub>) \u2212 log(N<sub>2(IR)</sub>)/(N<sub>2(No-IR)</sub>), where N<sub>1(No-IR)</sub> and N<sub>2(No-IR)</sub> represent the initial densities of the two competing strains before IR treatment, and N<sub>1(IR)</sub> and N<sub>2(IR)</sub> represent the corresponding densities after IR exposure. Normally, in a direct competition experiment, plates with fewer than 20 colonies of either competitor are usually excluded to reduce the effect of outliers caused by low counts (<a href=\"#bib5\">Breed and Dotterrer, 1916</a>). However, because the differences in fitness after IR treatment is so great between CB2000 Ara<sup>\u2212</sup>and CB2000 wtRecA wtDnaB wtYfjK and between Founder \u0394e14 Ara<sup>\u2212</sup>and Founder \u0394e14 RecA D276N DnaB P80H YfjK A151D, it was virtually impossible to retrieve at least 20 colonies of the sensitive strains in a range that we could also use to calculate the density of the resistant strains. The selection rates in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> are approximate, because there were less than 20 colonies counted on plates for the sensitive strains. However, the trend that we show in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> is strongly conserved. By reverting the three mutations in DNA metabolism genes, CB2000 loses virtually all of its IR resistance. We report in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> that when treated with 2000 Gy, CB2000 Ara\u2212 has <i>at least</i> a two log fitness advantage over CB2000 wtRecA wtDnaB wtYfjK and inversely, Founder \u0394e14 Ara- RecA D276N DnaB P80H YfjK P80H has at least a two log advantage over Founder \u0394e14. Because their sensitivities to IR were so similar, we did not have a problem with retrieving more than 20 colonies for each strain in the competition of Founder \u0394e14 and CB2000 wtRecA wtDnaB wtYfjK. Rather, CB2000 wtRecA wtDnaB wtYfjK had less than a half log advantage (less than threefold) over Founder \u0394e14, again illustrating the importance of mutations in these three genes for extreme radiation resistance."

To quantify signals, standard compounds of the observed metabolites were prepared at 2, 5, and 10 mM. The resonances from these compounds were linearly regressed in order to measure concentration as a function of intensity. The samples were normalized to 5 mM MES and their resultant peak intensities used to obtain concentrations of the measured metabolites using the regression slopes."

Using genetic analyses, the authors show that three out of the 69 mutations found in one lineage account for most of the IR tolerance on top of the one found in the starting strain (with an e14 prophage deletion). All three mutations are involved in DNA repair and replication. The authors convincingly conclude that genetic innovations involving pre-existing DNA repair functions likely play a large role in the acquisition of unusually high IR tolerance."

Due to personnel availability and technical issues, construction of the various double mutants that might include <i>yfjK</i> and testing them would require several additional months. Since these are interesting but would not address any central thesis of the paper, we have elected to move ahead without them. We note that the <i>yfjK</i> story is complex, and will be one subject of a study soon to get underway. It does seem like <i>yfjK</i> is distinct from <i>recA</i> and <i>dnaB</i>. A <i>yfjK</i> deletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) results in a significant increase in IR resistance, whereas <i>recA</i> deletions exhibit slightly reduced growth and viability even without IR exposure.

Small changes in the starting cell density should not affect the kinds and levels of damage inflicted as long as the cells are in log phase and thus in a similar metabolic state. We have previously shown (Harris 2009) that each of the four evolved populations highlighted in this study (IR-1-20, IR-2-20, IR-3-20, and IR-4-20) grow at the same rate, presumably because the outgrowth phase of each selection cycle would tend to select against any slow growers."

We note that CB1000-30 is not an isolate, but a rather complex population (derived from CB1000) that has been subjected to 30 additional cycles of irradiation-driven selection. The cells in this population have 3-4 times as many mutations as do the cells in the populations we focus on the most in this paper (as stated in the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph of the Results). We suspect that this population may either repair its DNA faster or may have lost some mechanism that normally constrains growth after damage, but a great deal of work would be needed to establish these or some other mechanism. The levels of radiation resistance in this more evolved population mean that delivering sufficient IR to kill 90% of the cells requires irradiation for many hours using the <sup>60</sup>Co source currently available. A higher dose rate may well constrain growth. We do not have the capacity to control temperature in the irradiator."

CB1000-30 actually grows slower than the Founder strain under all conditions when radiation is not present. Given that the outgrowth stages of each selection cycle would tend to select against slow growers, we think this slower growth is significant and may be associated with another genetic innovation that makes a substantial contribution to fitness with respect to IR resistance in these cells. This is an issue that we will be examining in ongoing work."
