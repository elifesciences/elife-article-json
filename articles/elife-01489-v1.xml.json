In virus-infected cells MAVS forms prion-like aggregates to activate antiviral signaling cascades, but the underlying structural mechanism is unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopic structures of the helical filaments formed by both the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of MAVS and a truncated MAVS lacking part of the proline-rich region and the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Both structures are left-handed three-stranded helical filaments, revealing specific interfaces between individual CARD subunits that are dictated by electrostatic interactions between neighboring strands and hydrophobic interactions within each strand. Point mutations at multiple locations of these two interfaces impaired filament formation and antiviral signaling. Super-resolution imaging of virus-infected cells revealed rod-shaped MAVS clusters on mitochondria. These results elucidate the structural mechanism of MAVS polymerization, and explain how an \u03b1-helical domain uses distinct chemical interactions to form self-perpetuating filaments."

In virus-infected cells MAVS forms prion-like aggregates to activate antiviral signaling cascades, but the underlying structural mechanism is unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopic structures of the helical filaments formed by both the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of MAVS and a truncated MAVS lacking part of the proline-rich region and the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Both structures are left-handed three-stranded helical filaments, revealing specific interfaces between individual CARD subunits that are dictated by electrostatic interactions between neighboring strands and hydrophobic interactions within each strand. Point mutations at multiple locations of these two interfaces impaired filament formation and antiviral signaling. Super-resolution imaging of virus-infected cells revealed rod-shaped MAVS clusters on mitochondria. These results elucidate the structural mechanism of MAVS polymerization, and explain how an \u03b1-helical domain uses distinct chemical interactions to form self-perpetuating filaments."

These filaments then activate inactive MAVS proteins, leading to the formation of more filaments. While a region of the MAVS protein called caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) is known to be involved in the formation of the filaments, the chemical interactions that govern the formation process have yet to be described."

Xu et al. went on to visualize full-length MAVS filaments in virus-infected cells, and to verify that mutations that impair the assembly of MAVS filaments also prevent RNA viruses from triggering the production of interferon. These results have the potential to inform future studies of the innate immune response, as well as investigations into the assembly of proteins to form prion-like filaments."

Initiation of innate immune response relies on a group of pattern recognition receptors, which recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including microbial nucleic acids, bacterial cell wall components and certain highly conserved proteins. Two groups of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting viral RNAs. The first group is the membrane-anchored Toll-like receptors (TLRs), located on the cell surface or in endosomal membranes and acting as sensors of viral RNAs encountered in extracellular environment (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kawai and Akira, 2006</a>). The second group of sensors resides in the cytosol. They belong to a family of cytosolic RNA helicases called RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), including retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-association gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009</a>). Recognition of viral RNAs by RLRs leads to the activation of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS; also known as IPS1, VISA and CARDIF). Activated MAVS triggers rapid production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kawai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Meylan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Seth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Xu et al., 2005</a>)."

Both proteins contain N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), a central RNA helicase, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). Despite sharing a similar domain structure, RIG-I and MDA5 are activated by complementary sets of viral RNA ligands through distinct mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Loo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Iwasaki, 2012</a>). RIG-I recognizes short blunt ends of dsRNA with 5\u2032-triphosphate caps (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hornung et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schlee et al., 2009</a>), as well as long dsRNAs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kohlway et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Patel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Peisley et al., 2013</a>). Ligand binding to the helicase domain and CTD induces a conformational change that liberates RIG-I from an autoinhibited state and exposes its N-terminal tandem CARDs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kowalinski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Luo et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, MDA5 detects long dsRNAs made of hundreds to thousands of base pairs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kato et al., 2008</a>). The helicase domain and CTD of MDA5 cooperatively assemble into helical filaments along the dsRNA, leaving the tandem CARDs of MDA5 flexibly exposed on the periphery of the filament (<a href=\"#bib50\">Peisley et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berke and Modis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). The exposed CARDs of RIG-I and MDA5 subsequently bind to unanchored lysine-63 (K63) polyubiquitin chains and form oligomers. The latter gain a high capacity of activating MAVS on mitochondria, presumably through CARD\u2013CARD interactions (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zeng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jiang et al., 2012</a>). The exact mechanism for the polyubiquitin-dependent interaction between active RIG-I and inactive MAVS is not well defined."

                        "text": "MAVS is ubiquitously expressed on the outer membrane of mitochondria. It consists of an N-terminal CARD domain, a proline-rich region (PRR) preceding a poorly structured middle segment, and a monotopic transmembrane (TM) domain at the very C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Recent studies have shown that upon activation, MAVS molecules polymerize themselves into functional aggregates (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hou et al., 2011</a>). These high molecular weight aggregates behave like prion fibers, because they are detergent-resistant, protease-resistant and self-perpetuating by inducing inactive MAVS to form functional aggregates. The N-terminal CARD domain of MAVS is necessary and sufficient for forming active MAVS aggregates. It shares some homology with the first CARD domains in both MDA5 and RIG-I (25% and 20% sequence identity respectively). A crystal structure of the MAVS CARD, fused to a maltose-binding protein (MBP), exhibits a typical helical bundle of six antiparallel \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#bib53\">Potter et al., 2008</a>). However, the isolated MAVS CARD without the MBP self-assembles into filamentous structures, which can promote endogenous, inactive MAVS to form highly active aggregates (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hou et al., 2011</a>). How the CARD domain triggers MAVS aggregation remains poorly understood."

To understand the structural basis underlying the filament formation, we solved the 3D structure of MAVS CARD filaments at 9.6 \u00c5 resolution by cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and iterative helical real space refinement (IHRSR) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Frank, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Egelman, 2007</a>). Based on the cryoEM map and the crystal structure of the individual MAVS CARD, we built a pseudoatomic model of the filament and identified two new CARD\u2013CARD interfaces that are important for filament formation. Mutations of residues found at the two interfaces disrupted MAVS self-association and abrogated the activation of the signaling pathway in cells. In order to understand the domain arrangement of the native MAVS aggregates, we obtained a 16.4 \u00c5 cryoEM map of a nearly full-length MAVS protein without part of the proline-rich region (PRR) and the C-terminal transmembrane domain (MAVS\u0394ProTM). The cryoEM map of the MAVS\u0394ProTM filament has the same CARD filament in the center, which is surrounded by extra fragmented densities in the periphery. This arrangement makes the CARD filament the organization center of the MAVS aggregates, and suggests a novel mechanism to expose the central segments of MAVS for downstream signaling effector recognition and signal amplification. To visualize the full-length MAVS filaments in virus-infected cells, we obtained three-dimensional Structured Illumination Microscopic (3D-SIM) images that achieved a sufficiently high resolution for us to discern the rod-shaped ultrathin MAVS filaments. These native thin filaments are on average \u223c400 nm long and usually seen among mitochondrial membranes. In accordance with the cryoEM studies, point mutations that disrupted MAVS filament formation abrogated the redistribution and aggregation of MAVS on mitochondrial membrane and blocked the induction of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2) in response to RNA virus infection. These results elucidate the structural mechanism for the formation of functional MAVS filaments."

These features enabled us to determine a unique orientation of the crystal structure of the MAVS CARD (residues 1\u201393) in the cryoEM map. Recognition of these structural features also allowed for independent confirmation of the chirality to the cryoEM map because only the left-handed map allowed the three helices (H1, H4 and H3) to be positioned well into the density map without modification (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). After the docking of these three helices, the 6<sup>th</sup> helix (H6) was naturally fit into a rod-shaped feature next to the H1. Rigid body refinement using SITUS (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wriggers, 2010</a>) then locally optimized the agreement between the X-ray model and the cryoEM map (insets in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Even though both H2 and H5 are contained in the density map, there is a small discrepancy between their orientations and the density features lining the inner pore of the filament (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), suggesting a possible local rearrangement of the CARD domain upon filament formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Because the rearrangement of H2 and H5 is not well defined by the density features and there was a small density next to H5 that is not fully accounted for due to probably inexact segmentation of the helical density map into individual units, we did not use flexible fitting to optimize the local positions of these two helices. Helical symmetry operations and threefold symmetry were subsequently applied to generate a pseudo-atomic model for the CARD filament (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

The first (H1) and last (H6) helices of the CARD are positioned at the outer surface of the filament (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). This arrangement provides the structural basis for other domains to be connected to the filaments in the center, in keeping with previous observations that a N-terminal small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) tag and other domains added to the C-terminus of CARD did not prevent filament formation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hou et al., 2011</a>). There is some unoccupied density at the surface of the EM map next to the N- and C-termini of the docked CARD model. This may be attributed to the residual density from the N-terminal Flag tag and the additional seven residues at the C-terminus in the protein used for preparing the cryoEM specimens, but not in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Their replacement with alanine or reversely charged residues still allowed potent induction of IFN\u03b2 production in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast, D40, R41 and R43 are located in the H3 and very close to the inter-strand interface.

W56 is well conserved (leucine residue in horse). In the crystal structure of MAVS CARD, the side chain of W56 adopts different conformations, with a major conformer (60% occupancy) exposed to solvent and stacked against the ring structure of residue F16 in immediate vicinity (magnified view on the right side of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Potter et al., 2008</a>). Y30 is a fairly conserved residue (histidine in cattle) that protrudes to the close proximity of W56 in the other CARD molecule at the interface. Even though the atomic details of the side chain packing are not fully resolved, the three ring structures from these three residues appear to be important for the intra-strand stability. Single alanine substitution of F16, W56 or Y30 almost completely abolished MAVS activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), but mutations of some of the residues next to them (R52 and S49 as examples) had little effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Interestingly, when we introduced different ring-containing residues to these positions, such as F16H, W56F, W56Y, Y30F and Y30H, we were able to largely rescue MAVS activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These results support that the hydrophobic packing among the three ring-containing residues is important for the intra-strand interface. D53 is one helical turn below W56, and its side chain sits at the boundary between the aqueous phase and the hydrophobic core packing of F16, W56 and Y30. When we introduced an alanine to this position, it completely abolished the MAVS activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting that the charged D53 may enforce the hydrophobic interaction above the aqueous surface. Close to the central pore of the helical filament, residue L48 appears in close contact with a group of short chain residues and contributes to a separate hydrophobic patch. Even though atomic details in side chain packing are unclear, substitution of L48 with charged residues (D or K), but not alanine, completely abolished MAVS activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting that this second hydrophobic patch is also important for intra-strand interaction."

We performed random mutagenesis and screened for soluble CARD mutants by using a recently developed solubility screen (<a href=\"#bib13\">Harada et al., 2008</a>). Mutated CARDs fused to murine dihydrofolate reductase (mDHFR) were expressed. While mDHFR fused to wild-type CARD appeared in inclusion bodies due to CARD oligomerization, it remained soluble when it was fused a CARD mutant that failed to oligomerize. Expression of soluble mDHFR-CARD was selected by trimethoprim, which specifically inhibits bacterial DHFR, but not mDHFR. Our screen recognized multiple sites that are important for CARD oligomerization (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Biochemical analysis confirmed that most mutants from the screen were expressed as soluble proteins, and eluted as homogenous monomers in gel-filtration chromatography (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Almost all the mutations out of the solubility screen are conserved and at the protein surface.

Compared to full-length MAVS, MAVS\u0394ProTM is soluble when fused with SUMO, and can form functional polymers after removal of SUMO.

We built a cryo dataset of 8909 boxed segments (particles) out of individual MAVS\u0394ProTM filaments.

MAVS\u0394ProTM has \u223c300 extra residues C-terminal to its CARD. Some of these extra residues most likely contribute to the peripheral densities in the cryoEM map. These extra densities were clearly visible in the class averages calculated from the aligned filament images (red arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Because of the intrinsic disorder in the segment between the CARD and the TM domain of MAVS, the majority of the extra residues did not produce significant density in the cryoEM map. A key conclusion from this comparison is that the CARD filament is in the center of the MAVS aggregates and the rest of the molecule is connected to the peripheral surface of the filament. Because the C-terminal TM domain is integrated in the mitochondrial membrane, the CARD filament and the membrane anchor the two ends of each MAVS molecule so that the intervening region is exposed to recruit cytosolic signaling effector molecules such as the TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) proteins (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Although transient expression of wild-type MAVS resulted in constitutive signaling (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kawai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Meylan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Seth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Xu et al., 2005</a>), the low expression level in the stable cell lines did not lead to constitutive activation of downstream target genes. Like endogenous protein, Flag-tagged MAVS was properly localized to the mitochondrial membranes, as demonstrated by its co-localization with either MitoTracker or TOM20, a 20 kDa subunit of the translocase in the outer mitochondrial membrane (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1, 3A</a>, Mock). Infection by Sendai virus induced the redistribution of MAVS protein and the formation of densely packed, speckled MAVS puncta on the surface of mitochondria, along with the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB subunit p65 and induction of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1, 3</a>). In addition, Sendai virus also induced MAVS aggregation, which was detected by semi-denaturing detergent agarose electrophoresis (SDD-AGE; <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hou et al., 2011</a>). Based on the nuclear translocation of p65 after viral infection, these bright MAVS puncta were observed in a majority of virus-infected cells (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). In contrast, the bright puncta did not form in cells expressing MAVS mutants that failed to form filaments (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1, 2 and 3A</a>). As negative controls, mutants (E80A and F16H) that do not affect the MAVS filament formation were found to have normal puncta formation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1, 2 and 3C</a>). Together these results support that the CARD-mediated aggregate formation is the key structural element for activating MAVS signaling in cells (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>)."

The resolution of conventional fluorescence microscopy is limited to \u223c200 nm in lateral (x, y) dimensions, and \u223c500 nm along the optical axis. SR-SIM increases both the lateral and axial resolutions by a factor of two (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gustafsson et al., 2008</a>). SR-SIM images of Flag-tagged wild-type MAVS showed a fairly uniform distribution on the surface of mitochondria as it appeared in concentric rings around almost every MitoTracker-stained mitochondrion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, the last image in the top row). In cells infected with Sendai virus, the SR-SIM images revealed a clear redistribution of MAVS into rod-shaped clusters that interfaced with only a small fraction of mitochondria (e.g., white arrowheads in the rightmost image of the bottom row in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Because the expression level of MAVS in cells remained the same before and after viral infection (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3D</a> and references) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2013</a>), the redistribution of MAVS from one mitochondrion to another during the puncta formation may result from mitochondrial fusion (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yasukawa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Castanier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Koshiba et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, MAVS aggregates on some mitochondria may be degraded through an unknown mechanism, which is less likely because of the unchanged level of MAVS protein. The diameter of the rod-shaped MAVS clusters is probably less than 100 nm, the lateral resolution limit of SR-SIM."

The MAVS aggregates in cells are indeed rod-shaped clusters that may contain MAVS molecules from multiple mitochondria. The CARD filaments form the central elements of the MAVS aggregates, and can promote their own growth by attracting new CARDs into the pre-poised interaction interfaces. The filaments are localized on the mitochondrial surface and the MAVS TM domains are embedded inside the outer mitochondrial membranes. These two ends of each MAVS molecule provide important spatial constraints that may force the intervening coiled sequence to be well extended and exposed for recruiting down-stream signaling molecules (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Bioinformatic analysis suggests that the middle segment of MAVS forms random coils, which, if present by themselves in aqueous phase, would not likely be fully extended and thus may deter efficient binding of multiple positive or negative regulators of MAVS. The spatial arrangement between the CARD filament and the mitochondrial membrane provides a good solution to this problem of intrinsic disorder. The prion-like filament formation of MAVS thus uses very different chemistry than other prion proteins, and orchestrates the signaling domains of MAVS into a high-affinity platform for rapid and efficient signaling."

In the resting state, MAVS CARD is sequestered and has a low probability of forming polymers.

These interfaces maintain the tight and dense packing of individual CARDs in the filaments, which, together with the strong inter-strand electrostatic interactions, probably make the filaments detergent-resistant. During filament formation, there are counter-acting forces, such as decrease in entropy and possible structural adjustment at the pore-lining surface of the CARD filament (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), which would increase the energy level of the filaments. The net decrease in free energy supporting the filament formation is due to the four interaction interfaces for every CARD. But the counter-balance of these positive and negative energy terms likely makes the filaments fairly sensitive to mutations. Indeed, the four interfaces appear to be dominated by hot spots because point mutations in multiple positions are capable of destabilizing the filaments. The open ends of the CARD filaments provide three binding sites for each incoming CARD molecule. Because of the net gain in free energy for each CARD, the longer filaments are expected to be more stable than the shorter ones, leading to the filaments that are up to 10 microns long under cryoEM conditions. Inside virus-infected cells, the average length of the rod-shaped MAVS clusters is merely \u223c400 nm. The physical length of MAVS filaments in cells may be limited by the number of MAVS molecules in each mitochondrion and by the dynamics of mitochondrial fusion and fission (<a href=\"#bib46\">Onoguchi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

These independent molecules need to be juxtaposed in order to poise three CARDs to form the first layer of the filament. The tandem CARDs in one RIG-I molecule are restrained by a short \u03b1-helix running between them, and are less likely to serve this role. There are two possible scenarios for two RIG-I/RNA complexes to join for initiation: (1) Two individual RIG-I/RNA monomers can come together; or (2) RIG-I molecules may form dimers or oligomers along short duplex RNAs. Crystallographic studies of RIG-I (full-length or truncated) have led to the proposal that the RIG-I/RNA complex might act as monomers in conjunction with polyubiquitin to activate MAVS (<a href=\"#bib4\">Civril et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hild et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kowalinski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Luo et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2013</a>). Should two or more RIG-I/short RNA monomeric complexes be able to nucleate a MAVS filament, we would expect the short RNAs (10\u201317 bp) used in the crystallographic studies to activate the pathway. But the published data did not lead to a consensus on the activities of these short RNAs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fujita, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schlee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Marq et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kohlway et al., 2013</a>). Recent biochemical data showed that RIG-I tandem CARDs and K63 polyubiquitin form relatively stable 4:4 oligomers, which may nucleate the helical filamentous structure formed by the MAVS CARDs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jiang et al., 2012</a>). In a similar fashion, the RIG-I (or MDA5)/RNA helical complex may present multiple CARD domains on its periphery where multiple MAVS filaments may be initiated (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berke and Modis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, negative-stain EM studies have suggested either parallel or anti-parallel dimers to be the active form of RLRs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Murali et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ranjith-Kumar et al., 2009</a>). Structural studies of active RIG-I-RNA and RIG-I-MAVS complexes are needed to provide a detailed mechanism by which RIG-I initiates MAVS polymerization."

The MyDDosome formation is thought to bring multiple kinase domains of the IRAKs together for efficient activation. This affinity-enhancing scheme for recruiting downstream effectors is essentially the same as in the MAVS filaments. The much longer MAVS filaments would thus entail a significant amplification of the signal that nucleates their formation and enhance the RLR sensitivity to viral RNAs. Because TRAF2 and TRAF3 both form trimers (<a href=\"#bib48\">Park et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ni et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zheng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Napetschnig and Wu, 2013</a>), MAVS filaments may enhance the TRAF-MAVS interaction through increased avidity, and boost the signaling efficacy significantly."

The filament growth needs to bring randomly distributed MAVS into close vicinity. The limited number of MAVS molecules per mitochondrion suggests that the long MAVS filaments may be contributed by multiple mitochondria. The clustered MAVS molecules become sequestered during the dynamic mitochondrial fission and fusion cycles. The fusion of sequestered clusters leads to the redistribution of MAVS from being ubiquitously present in almost all mitochondria to being segregated on a small number of them. The self-promoting nature of in vivo MAVS filaments may be the driving force that leads to almost all MAVS being incorporated into filaments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Further analyses of MAVS redistribution and its correlation with mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics by live-cell imaging and computational analysis may provide more detailed insights into this process."

Images were taken under \u22122.5 to \u22124.0 microns of defocus at 29,000 \u00d7, which gave rise to a calibrated pixel size of 2.30 \u00c5 at the specimen level. The density of filaments in the cryo specimens was fairly low so that we had to collect a large number of images. After the evaluation of their power spectra, 1,088 Falcon images were selected, and a total of 18,500 short filaments were boxed out for analysis."

                                "text": "The analysis of the datasets of both the MAVS CARD filaments and the MAVS\u0394ProTM filaments followed the IHRSR method developed by Dr Edward Egelman\u2019s group at University of Virginia. The method was implemented in SPIDER. Dr Egelman kindly provided the programs in SPIDER, and the HSEARCH_LORENTZ/HIMPOSE programs. All SPIDER programs were rewritten in order to run with SPIDER Version 19.08 in a Linux cluster that runs the Redhat Enterprise 5.0. Besides, new SPIDER programs were written to refine the map for out-of-plane tilting of the filaments and for local optimization in angle assignment. Extensive technical details could be found in reference (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mukherjee et al., 2014</a>). Briefly, from all images obtained in one session of data collection, the filaments were boxed out into 200 pixel segments (\u223c45.2 nm long at the specimen level) with 90% overlapping between neighboring ones from the same long filament. Filaments shorter than 200 pixels were discarded. The filament helical axis was always positioned roughly along the Y-axis. The defocus and astigmatism information for each image were determined by CTFFIND2 in the MRC package (IMAGE2010). The filament particles (boxed segments out of the raw filaments) were phase-flipped and band-pass filtered. We also tested the Wiener-filtering with a constant of 0.2 (1/SNR), and did not find significant difference from the phase-flipped dataset. Afterwards the filaments from different images out of one cryo session were pooled together as a subdataset. To start the analysis, we made sure that the summed power spectrum of each subdataset showed a faint (usually fuzzy) layer line at the position of the first meridional line (layer line 9; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The diameter of individual filaments was estimated from the raw images. A cylindrical volume that had the estimated diameter was generated in SPIDER and projected along Y-axis to be used as the first reference. The individual filaments were compared with the projection from the cylindrical volume. The shift in X-direction for each boxed segment (particle) was rounded to the nearest integer and applied to center the particle horizontally. The total power spectrum was calculated from all X-centered particles in the dataset. The four layer lines (LL = 1, 4, 5, and 9) were measured to prepare a (LL, Z*) table. The peak positions were indexed to make a table of (n, R). The n was estimated from a numeric table of Bessel functions from 0 to 14<sup>th</sup> orders. The helical indexing led to the initial guess of a 3-start helix (n = 3 or \u22123), with some uncertainty of a 4-start one (n = 4 or \u22124). We then tested the refinement for both a 3-start helix and 4-start one separately, and found that the model with a 3-start helical symmetry was able to converge to a 3D map with the right axial rise, but not the one with a 4-start symmetry (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D,G</a>). Full refinement with n = \u22124 was done to confirm this point. We therefore concluded that n = 3 was probably right (n = \u22123 is the mirror and equally possible). With this information, we did the initial analysis of all subdatasets from different cryo sessions independently in order to obtain the rotation angle (\u0394\u03a6) and the axial rise (\u0394z) for each subdataset. The axial rises for individual datasets collected at different magnifications or from different microscopes were brought together and compared to find the right parameters for interpolating the images in the different datasets and scaled them all together into one large dataset that contained 48,884 particles. The refinement of the large dataset against a cylindrical volume of a diameter of 90 \u00c5 quickly led to a stable solution (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>) with the symmetry parameters of \u0394\u03a6 = 53.6\u00b0 and \u0394z = 16.5 \u00c5. To test the robustness of the parameters, we also introduced 1.0 \u00c5 deviation to the axial rise in the middle of the refinement, and observed the quick recovery of the refinement to the stable solution (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This test suggested that the solution was quite stable."

We tried to eliminate a small fraction of images (\u223c20%) that corresponded to those class-averaged images showing clearly weak symmetry or distortions. But after that, we still saw distortions in the Eigen images calculated from the rest of the images. We therefore did not eliminate \u223c50% or more of the data to examine the resolution. After an initial refinement, we sorted the data into nine bins by aligning them against models whose symmetry parameters are centered around (\u0394\u03a6 = 53.6\u00b0, \u0394z = 16.5 \u00c5) with \u0394\u0394\u03a6 = 2.0\u00b0 and \u0394\u0394z = 1.5 \u00c5. The distribution of the particles into these 9 bins followed a Gaussian distribution, and the central bin had 20,825 particles and was selected for further refinement where the out-of-plane tilting was refined in 2\u00b0 steps to a maximum of 15\u00b0. After 140 runs the final map was stable and the symmetry well converged to \u0394\u03a6 = 53.6\u00b0 and \u0394z = 16.8 \u00c5. The final map was calculated from 15,366 boxed segments. The map after IHRSR was corrected by an average CTF envelope calculated from the CTF parameters for all images used in the final map calculation. After the FSC calculation (see next paragraph), a negative B-factor of \u22121,100 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> was applied to sharpen the final map to 9.6 \u00c5."

Two completely independent volumes were obtained by refining the two half datasets against a cylinder.

The two volumes without symmetry imposition were aligned in UCSF Chimera (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The second volume was shifted by 0.225 pixels and rotated by \u221228.96\u00b0 around Y-axis before the FSC calculation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The estimated resolution at FSC = 0.5 was 9.6 \u00c5. Because of almost exactly the same symmetry in two volumes, we worried about noise correlation and did not use the 0.143 threshold for our resolution estimate. As a control, we calculated the FSC before the two volumes were aligned, and found that the FSC quickly fell down to below 0.1 at around 40 \u00c5. To confirm that the final map recapitulates the characteristic of the original dataset, we calculated the summed power spectrum of projections from the map at 360 different orientations around its helical axis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, right).

Recognition of these surface features led to a fairly unique position for the X-ray model and resolved the ambiguity in chirality, consistent with the cryoET results. After one CARD was docked into the map, a hexamer model was built by applying symmetry operations. We segmented the cryoEM density and extracted a portion that represents a hexamer formed by two layers of protein subunits using the segmentation tools in UCSF Chimera.

The reconstructions reveal that the CARD domain forms a left handed, three-stranded helix, and the CARD crystal structure has been docked into the 9.6 \u00c5 resolution map to produce a pseudoatomic model of the parallel triple helix and models for the different protein-protein interfaces that stabilize the structure. The model indicates that the helix is stabilized by two different types of interfaces, a hydrophilic intrastrand interface and a hydrophobic interstrand interface. A series of experiments support the accuracy and relevance of the structure, including extensive mutational analyses of the two major protein-protein interfaces and SR-SIM imaging of the tube-shaped MAVS polymers formed in cells."

The work is generally of high technical quality, and the extent of supporting experimentation is impressive. The work is therefore, in principle, appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i>. Our two major concerns (described below) are: 1) it is difficult to be absolutely certain of the veracity of the reconstruction and pseudoatomic model, and 2) It is important to prove, unambiguously, that mitochondrial clustering and tube formation correlate with antiviral signaling and with the ability of MAVS to polymerize in vitro."

We tested 4-start helical symmetry previously and were not able to converge to the right axial rise. We started with different rotational angles from 40 to 51 degrees, and did not find one that works for n=4. One example is now shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>. We therefore ruled out the possibility of n=4. Based on the indexing of the layer lines and peaks, we did not find that a 2-start model was a possibility. As the reviewers requested, we tested the 2-start helical symmetry, but the refinement did not converge and the axial rise went continuously from the correct 16.7 \u00c5 to the incorrect 19.5 \u00c5 after 50 runs. The reviewers asked about the calculations of residuals with \u201cxhelicals\u201d. We looked into it. In the new distribution of the IHRSR, this program was neither recompiled nor tested. When we used it to search for symmetry, it did not produce the right results as the well-tested \u201chsearch_lorentz\u201d. We therefore did not use it in our analysis. But this does not change our conclusion that n=3 is the right rotational symmetry."

Mutations of the surface-exposed residues (R52A, E70A, R77A, E80A, D86A and E87A) that are not involved in the inter-strand interaction did not impair MAVS signaling. On the other hand, R41, R43 and D40, which are close to the positively charged patch of R64 and R65 at the electrostatic interface (inter-strand), inhibited MAVS signaling. Their effects and their positions in the helical filament are added to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>.
