We determined the crystal structure of the perinuclear domain of human LAP1. LAP1 possesses an atypical AAA+ fold. While LAP1 lacks canonical nucleotide binding motifs, its strictly conserved arginine 563 is positioned exactly where the arginine finger of canonical AAA+ ATPases is found. Based on modeling and electron microscopic analysis, we propose that LAP1 targets Torsin to the nuclear envelope by forming an alternating, heterohexameric (LAP1-Torsin)<sub>3</sub> ring, in which LAP1 acts as the Torsin activator. The experimental data show that mutation of arginine 563 in LAP1 reduces its ability to stimulate TorsinA ATPase hydrolysis. This knowledge may help scientists understand the etiology of DYT1 primary dystonia, a movement disorder caused by a single glutamate deletion in TorsinA."

We determined the crystal structure of the perinuclear domain of human LAP1. LAP1 possesses an atypical AAA+ fold. While LAP1 lacks canonical nucleotide binding motifs, its strictly conserved arginine 563 is positioned exactly where the arginine finger of canonical AAA+ ATPases is found. Based on modeling and electron microscopic analysis, we propose that LAP1 targets Torsin to the nuclear envelope by forming an alternating, heterohexameric (LAP1-Torsin)<sub>3</sub> ring, in which LAP1 acts as the Torsin activator. The experimental data show that mutation of arginine 563 in LAP1 reduces its ability to stimulate TorsinA ATPase hydrolysis. This knowledge may help scientists understand the etiology of DYT1 primary dystonia, a movement disorder caused by a single glutamate deletion in TorsinA."

LAP1 localizes to the nuclear envelope (NE) via its lamin-interacting domain, whereas LULL1 is found throughout the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Senior and Gerace, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Goodchild and Dauer, 2005</a>). LAP1 and LULL1 associate with Torsins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goodchild and Dauer, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Naismith et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>), which are ER-resident members of the <span class=\"underline\">A</span>TPases <span class=\"underline\">A</span>ssociated with a variety of cellular <span class=\"underline\">A</span>ctivities (AAA+ ATPases) superfamily (<a href=\"#bib13\">Iyer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hanson and Whiteheart, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</a>). AAA+ ATPases use ATP hydrolysis to undergo conformational changes and to exert mechanical force on a substrate. AAA+ ATPases are involved in many processes, including vesicle fusion and scission, protein folding/unfolding, complex assembly/disassembly, protein transport, and nucleic acid remodeling. Detailed mechanistic knowledge exists for a number of AAA+ ATPases, but not for Torsins. Torsins are found in all animals, but not in single-cell organisms and plants. Deletion of a single glutamate in TorsinA (humans have four Torsin orthologs: TorsinA, TorsinB, Torsin2A, and Torsin3A) at position 302/303 causes the movement disorder DYT1 primary dystonia (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ozelius et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Breakefield et al., 2008</a>). Mammalian TorsinA has been assigned to a variety of possible functions including nuclear envelope (NE) organization, synaptic vesicle transport and turnover, operation of the secretory pathway, protein degradation, cytoskeletal organization and transport via NE budding (<a href=\"#bib29\">Vander Heyden et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Granata and Warner, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jokhi et al., 2013</a>). While LAP1 and LULL1 were first considered as Torsin substrates (<a href=\"#bib20\">Naismith et al., 2009</a>), they are now being proposed as possible activators of Torsin (<a href=\"#bib35\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>)."

Our data suggest that LAP1 and LULL1 can both form heterohexameric ring assemblies with Torsin, whereby Torsin is activated through an arginine finger at amino acid (aa) R563 of LAP1 (R449 of LULL1). Thus LAP1 and LULL1 each have dual roles, namely the targeting and activation of Torsins."

Because the protein failed to yield crystals alone, we produced a camelid single domain (VHH) antibody fragment, VHH-BS1, against LAP1 as a crystallization chaperone. The complex of VHH-BS1 and LAP1 yielded well-diffracting crystals (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The structure was solved using molecular replacement with VHH as the search model (for details, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In the asymmetric unit we find two LAP1 molecules related by a non-crystallographic symmetry axis, each identically bound by one VHH. The final structure is completely built, except for four N-terminal residues in LAP1, which seem disordered in the crystal (six N-terminal residues in the second LAP1 copy)."

                        "text": "The LAP1 structure clearly has an AAA+ like fold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). AAA+ proteins are a functionally diverse group within the vast family of \u2018P-loop\u2019-type NTP-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Iyer et al., 2004</a>). Typically, AAA+ proteins are characterized by strongly conserved sequence motifs involved in nucleotide recognition. Subcategories within AAA+ proteins are based on distinct secondary structure topologies. The D2 domain of the two-ring AAA+ ATPase ClpB superimposes on LAP1 with an rmsd of 3.28 \u00c5 over 111 C\u03b1 positions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Zeymer et al., 2014</a>). ClpB belongs to the additional strand conserved E (ASCE) family (<a href=\"#bib13\">Iyer et al., 2004</a>). Like ASCE-type AAA+ proteins, such as ClpA, ClpB, and p97, LAP1 also has a central, five-stranded parallel \u03b2-sheet, surrounded on both sides by 10 helices in total (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The secondary structure topology is \u03b1(\u22121)\u03b1(0)\u03b21\u03b1(1)\u03b22-\u03b1(2a)\u03b1(2b)\u03b23\u03b1(3a)\u03b1(3b)\u03b24\u03b1(4)\u03b25\u03b1(5)\u03b1(6), using the AAA+ nomenclature (<a href=\"#bib7\">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</a>). In contrast to canonical ASCE-type ATPases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), LAP1 lacks a C-terminal domain. Instead the C terminus is attached to helix \u03b11 via a disulfide bond between the highly conserved residues C424 and C582 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In a AAA+ ATPase, the nucleotide binding pocket is the most sequence-conserved region, defined by the essential Walker A and B motifs. LAP1 lacks a recognizable Walker A region, typically located between \u03b21 and \u03b11 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Instead, helix \u03b11 is N-terminally extended compared to AAA+ ATPases, thereby sterically blocking the nucleotide-binding pocket. The Walker B motif with the canonical sequence hhhhDE (h, hydrophobic), is instead hhhhHR in human LAP1, and therefore cannot interact with nucleotide. Finally, the conserved disulfide bridge would also interfere with nucleotide binding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The four canonical nucleotide-sensing elements, Walker A, Walker B, Sensor 1, and Sensor 2 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</a>), are well conserved and immediately recognizable in TorsinA when compared to ClpB-D2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Zhu et al., 2010</a>). AAA+ ATPases are often activated by an arginine residue (\u2018arginine finger\u2019) in the neighboring protomer in the hexameric ring assembly, such that this arginine is positioned to reach the phosphate binding site (<a href=\"#bib32\">Wendler et al., 2012</a>). While we do not find a conserved arginine in TorsinA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) at the expected position at the end of helix \u03b15, in LAP1 this residue is a strictly conserved arginine (R563). Consequently, modeling and phylogenetic analysis strongly suggest that LAP1 and TorsinA might form a heterohexameric ring (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) with three active sites in which TorsinA and its partner subunits alternate to form the ring. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the recent observation that LAP1 and LULL1 activate TorsinA in vitro (<a href=\"#bib35\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>)."

This confirms recent work which biochemically showed that LAP1 and LULL1 activate TorsinA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). A heterohexameric ring assembly for AAA+ ATPases is unusual, but not unprecedented (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gribun et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Saffian et al., 2012</a>). However, to our knowledge this is the first description of a heterohexameric assembly where a canonical AAA+ domain alternates with a nucleotide-free AAA+ like domain, which we now call AAA+ Activator domain. It is striking that LAP1 and LULL1 lack all canonical nucleotide-binding elements. This feature has undoubtedly complicated their detection by sequence-based methods. Using the LAP1 structure, we performed a reverse hidden Markov model search to possibly identify structurally similar proteins in various organisms using Backphyre (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</a>). Interestingly, the top hits that we find besides LAP1 homologs are the Torsins. This indicates that both proteins are possibly derived from a common ancestor. In Drosophila as well as in Caenorhabditis, we find LAP1 homologs that have so far escaped detection (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Gratifyingly, for all species where so far an orphaned Torsin has been found, we now also find a LAP1/LULL1 homolog (for many species, it is difficult to distinguish between LAP1 and LULL1 based on sequence alone). This lends further support to our model suggesting that a heterohexameric LAP1-Torsin ring is the functionally relevant protein assembly."

Perhaps VHH-BS1 fortuitously generates packing contacts important for crystal formation. We note that VHH-BS1 binds to the area immediately surrounding the arginine finger of LAP1, thereby interfering with TorsinA binding (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Inclusion of VHH-BS1 might prevent cryptic and poorly ordered hexamerization of LAP1 at high protein concentrations and therefore favor a more ordered conformation conducive to crystallization. Interestingly, VHH-BS1 can compete with LAP1 for TorsinA binding in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). When expressed intracellularly, it might be a useful tool to further characterize TorsinA-LAP1 function in vivo."

Torsin acts in close proximity to the NE or the ER membrane, depending on whether it interacts with membrane-bound LAP1 or LULL1, respectively. Membrane proximity is further ensured by the N-terminal hydrophobic region within TorsinA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Vander Heyden et al., 2011</a>). Using an ATP-trapped mutant, it was shown that TorsinA is involved in the exit of large ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules from the nucleus through a pathway akin to the nuclear egress of herpes-type viruses (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rose and Schlieker, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Speese et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jokhi et al., 2013</a>). A substrate-trap mutant of TorsinA localized to the neck of mRNP-filled vesicles that bud from the inner nuclear membrane (INM) into the perinuclear space (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jokhi et al., 2013</a>), consistent with our model of LAP1-mediated activation of TorsinA close to the INM. We therefore speculate that the so far elusive Torsin substrates include proteins involved in membrane scission. This is akin to the action of the AAA+ ATPase Vps4 involved in the scission of narrow membrane necks mediated by ESCRT-III (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) components (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hill and Babst, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">McCullough et al., 2013</a>), but with an important difference: while Vps4 acts on the inside of the necks, Torsins presumably act on the outside. We further speculate that under more physiological conditions, that is, properly complexed with LAP1 or LULL1 and engaged with substrate, the ATPase activity of Torsin might be substantially higher than that reported under the in vitro conditions tested so far."

Because of the unusual heterohexameric architecture with only three active sites, we expect substantial differences between this system and those that are better understood. One important aspect will be to unravel the role of the highly conserved cysteines, both in LAP1/LULL1 and in Torsin. While both proteins have conserved disulfides, these do not account for all cysteines and suggest a possible redox mechanism, as has been discussed previously (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zhu et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2008</a>). We note that in our model the most conserved cysteine C496 in LAP1 cannot engage in an intramolecular disulfide bridge, but is close to the nucleotide-binding site of the neighboring TorsinA. This remarkable conservation might indicate a role in a redox mechanism that is coupled to the catalytic cycle of Torsin-LAP1/LULL1. The lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is a site rich in oxidoreductases that assist in protein folding and assembly. The catalytic function(s) of the Torsin-LAP1/LULL1 assemblies may have co-opted part of this machinery."

The reaction was then run through an Amicon 10 kDa MWCO concentrator (EMD Millipore) to remove unreacted biotin. Incorporation of biotin was monitored spectrophotometrically. A 100 \u03bcl sample of MyOne Streptavidin T1 Dynabeads (ThermoFisher Scientific) was blocked in PBS/2% BSA for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C. Following blocking, 20 \u00b5g biotinylated antigen in PBS was added to the beads, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT), with rotation. The beads were then washed 3\u00d7 in PBS, and 200 \u00b5l of 10<sup>14</sup> pfu/ml M13 phage displaying the VHH library was added in PBS/2% BSA for 1 hr at RT. The beads were then washed 15\u00d7 in PBS/0.1% Tween 20. Phage was eluted by the addition of ER2738 <i>E. coli</i> (NEB, Ipswich, MA) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by elution with 200 mM glycine pH 2.2 for 10 min at RT. The glycine elution was neutralized and pooled with ER2738 culture, plated onto 2YT agar plates supplemented with 2% glucose, 5 \u00b5g/ml tetracycline, and 10 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin, and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C."

Plates were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min, and 100 \u00b5l of supernatant mixed 1:1 with PBS plus 5% non-fat dry milk was then added to an ELISA plate coated with 1 \u00b5g/ml antigen. Following multiple washes in PBS plus 1% Tween 20, anti-Etag-HRP antibody (Bethyl) was added at a 1:10,000 dilution in PBS plus 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 hr at RT. The plate was developed with fast kinetic TMB (Sigma-Aldrich), quenched with 1 M HCl and read out at 450 nm (Spectramax, Molecular Devices). ELISA positive clones were sequenced and subcloned into a bacterial expression vector (see above)."

LAP1 and LULL1 are homologous cofactors that activate TorsinA, but their mechanism of action has not been clear. The structure unexpectedly reveals that LAP1 also adopts a cryptic AAA+ ATPase fold, albeit apparently without a functional site for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This suggested the very intriguing possibility that LAP1 and LULL1 activate TorsinA by forming an alternating heterohexameric rings in which the catalytically active TorsinA subunits must pair with inactive LAP1 or LULL1 subunits that donate an \u201carginine finger\u201d to the TorsinA active sites. The authors present evidence in support of this hypothesis, including: A) Phylogenetic analyses reveal that LAP1 homologs can be found in species that have TorsinA homologs, and that the putative LAP1/LULL1 arginine finger residue is well conserved, B) Class averages from negatively stained EM images of co-expressed and co-purified LULL1-TorsinA complexes show hexameric rings, and C) Mutation of the putative LAP1 arginine finger residue (R563A) reduces the ATPase activity of the LAP1-TorsinA complex by approximately two-fold in a steady-state ATPase activity assay."

Both complexes elute at a volume consistent with a heterodimeric assembly (theoretical MW is 58.3 kDa), while LAP1 and LULL1 elute at a volume indicative of a monomer. In addition, we have performed EM analysis with LAP1 and LULL1 alone. On the resulting grids, under identical assay conditions as were previously used for the TorsinA(E171Q):LULL1 and TorsinA(E171Q):LAP1 grids, no particles are observed (new <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2</a>). Both experiments together are consistent with the notion that the hexameric rings observed on TorsinA(E171Q):LULL1 grids are best explained by the formation of trimers built from the stable TorsinA(E171Q):LULL1 heterodimeric units. Since TorsinA without LAP1 or LULL1 present is insoluble in our hands, we do not consider homohexameric TorsinA assemblies to be a possible explanation for our EM objects. To further support the latter point we set up a competition experiment in which we incubated stoichiometric TorsinA(E171Q):LAP1 complex with VHH-BS1 or a control VHH over several hours (new <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). VHH-BS1 competes with TorsinA(E171Q) for LAP1 binding and partially displaces TorsinA(E171Q). Free TorsinA(E171Q) then precipitates out of the solution, confirming the solubility problems.

The resolution cut was based on the CC1/2 value and visual inspection of the 2Fo-Fc electron density map. The P21 dataset has generally better data collection and refinement statistics, thus we replaced the original P1 dataset with the new P21 dataset in the revised manuscript. The LAP1-VHH-BS1 model built in both space groups is virtually identical."
