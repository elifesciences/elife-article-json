                    "text": "The transport receptor Crm1 mediates the export of diverse cargos containing leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs) through complex formation with RanGTP. To ensure efficient cargo release in the cytoplasm, NESs have evolved to display low affinity for Crm1. However, mechanisms that overcome low affinity to assemble Crm1-export complexes in the nucleus remain poorly understood. In this study, we reveal a new type of RanGTP-binding protein, Slx9, which facilitates Crm1 recruitment to the 40S pre-ribosome-associated NES-containing adaptor Rio2. In vitro, Slx9 binds Rio2 and RanGTP, forming a complex. This complex directly loads Crm1, unveiling a non-canonical stepwise mechanism to assemble a Crm1-export complex. A mutation in Slx9 that impairs Crm1-export complex assembly inhibits 40S pre-ribosome export. Thus, Slx9 functions as a scaffold to optimally present RanGTP and the NES to Crm1, therefore, triggering 40S pre-ribosome export. This mechanism could represent one solution to the paradox of weak binding events underlying rapid Crm1-mediated export."

To ensure efficient cargo release in the cytoplasm, NESs have evolved to display low affinity for Crm1. However, mechanisms that overcome low affinity to assemble Crm1-export complexes in the nucleus remain poorly understood. In this study, we reveal a new type of RanGTP-binding protein, Slx9, which facilitates Crm1 recruitment to the 40S pre-ribosome-associated NES-containing adaptor Rio2. In vitro, Slx9 binds Rio2 and RanGTP, forming a complex. This complex directly loads Crm1, unveiling a non-canonical stepwise mechanism to assemble a Crm1-export complex. A mutation in Slx9 that impairs Crm1-export complex assembly inhibits 40S pre-ribosome export. Thus, Slx9 functions as a scaffold to optimally present RanGTP and the NES to Crm1, therefore, triggering 40S pre-ribosome export. This mechanism could represent one solution to the paradox of weak binding events underlying rapid Crm1-mediated export."

This protein recognizes and binds to the part of a cargo molecule called a \u2018nuclear export signal\u2019, and the Crm1 protein also binds to another protein called RanGTP. Nuclear export signals bind weakly to Crm1, which in turn ensures that these cargos are easily released in the cytoplasm once transport is completed. However, this weak binding means that it has remained a mystery how Crm1 is able to efficiently transport cargos out of the nucleus to begin with."

The experiments identified another protein called Slx9 that shuttles rapidly between the inside and the outside of the nucleus. Fischer et al. observed that Slx9 binds directly to RanGTP and brings it together with the ribosome precursor cargo. When a complex of Slx9, RanGTP, and cargo is assembled, it further recruits Crm1 to the cargo. Thus, Slx9 acts as a scaffold to bring cargo into contact with Crm1 and RanGTP, and a tight complex is formed that enables the export of the cargo out of the nucleus. Yeast cells lacking Slx9 delay export of ribosome precursors out of the nucleus. These findings imply the existence of yet-unidentified proteins like Slx9 that help Crm1 to rapidly transport diverse cargos out from the nucleus and into the cytoplasm."

Yeast NPCs are approximately 60 MDa (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fernandez-Martinez et al., 2012</a>) and are composed of multiple copies of about 30 nucleoporins (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rout et al., 2000</a>). Cargos of different sizes and charges pass through the central transport channel of the NPC, which is filled with a meshwork of natively unfolded Phe-Gly (FG)-repeats present in FG-nucleoporins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Frey and G\u00f6rlich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Terry and Wente, 2009</a>). These nucleoporins generate a permeability barrier that allows passive diffusion of small molecules, such as ions and metabolites (<a href=\"#bib21\">Frey and G\u00f6rlich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Patel et al., 2007</a>). Macromolecules (&gt;40 kDa) require the assistance of nuclear transport receptors, including members of the importin-\u03b2-like family, to efficiently overcome this selectivity barrier (<a href=\"#bib48\">Macara, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Rout and Aitchison, 2001</a>).

Ran exists in both GDP- and GTP-bound forms, and the two states are asymmetrically distributed, with RanGTP significantly enriched in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakielny and Dreyfuss, 1999</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib26\">G\u00f6rlich and Kutay, 1999</a>). This gradient of RanGTP is established through the spatial separation of regulators of the Ran-cycle (<a href=\"#bib35\">Izaurralde et al., 1997</a>). Whereas the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor, RCC1 (Prp20 in yeast) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bischoff and Ponstingl, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fleischmann et al., 1991</a>), localizes to the nucleus, the Ran GTPase-activating protein, RanGAP1 (Rna1 in yeast), is found in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hopper et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Matunis et al., 1996</a>). Interactions between RanGTP and transport receptors are crucial for the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic exchange (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nachury and Weis, 1999</a>).

Crm1 recognizes and directly binds leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs) on cargos in the presence of RanGTP to form a Crm1-export complex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fornerod et al., 1997</a>). Although an essential NES-containing adaptor, Nmd3, has been identified for 60S pre-ribosome export (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ho and Johnson, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ho et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gadal et al., 2001</a>), a similar adaptor to recruit Crm1 to the 40S pre-ribosome remains elusive.

The essential mRNA and 60S pre-ribosome transport receptor Mex67-Mtr2, which does not directly utilize the RanGTP gradient, also facilitates nuclear export of the 40S pre-ribosomal cargo (<a href=\"#bib17\">Faza et al., 2012</a>). Despite the identification of several components of the export machinery, assembly steps and mechanisms that prepare the pre-ribosomal cargo for transport through the NPC remain largely unexplored."

However, the precise contribution of Slx9 to 40S pre-ribosome export has remained unclear. To investigate the function of yeast Slx9, we generated <i>slx9</i> variants by random mutagenesis and analyzed the growth of the resulting strains at different temperatures. One allele, <i>slx9L108P</i>, hereafter termed <i>slx9-1</i>, caused slow growth at temperatures between 20\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C, indistinguishable from <i>slx9\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top panel). Like <i>slx9\u2206</i>, <i>slx9-1</i> cells were not impaired in growth at 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Western analysis of whole cell lysates revealed that Slx9 and Slx9-1 were present at similar levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom panel), indicating that impaired growth of the <i>slx9-1</i> strain is not due to reduced levels of the mutant protein. As previously observed, Slx9-GFP localized primarily to the nucleolus, where it co-localized with the nucleolar marker Gar1-mCherry, as well as to the nucleoplasm (<a href=\"#bib17\">Faza et al., 2012</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Slx9-1-GFP displayed an identical localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating that the mutant protein is correctly targeted to the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. Slx9 maximally co-enriched with Enp1-TAP that purifies both the 90S and 40S pre-ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Faza et al., 2012</a>). A similar purification from <i>slx9-1</i> cells revealed that Enp1-TAP co-enriched at least as much Slx9-1 mutant protein as Slx9 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Together, these data show that Slx9-1 is correctly expressed, localized, and recruited to 40S pre-ribosomes."

Based on these genetic interactions, we asked whether Slx9 functions as a novel export factor for the 40S pre-ribosome. A salient feature of an export factor is that it rapidly shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. To test this, we employed the established heterokaryon assay (<a href=\"#bib2\">Altvater et al., 2014</a>). WT cells expressing Slx9-GFP were mated to <i>kar1-1</i> cells, which are deficient in nuclear fusion after cell conjugation, leading to heterokaryon formation. In order to distinguish between the two nuclei, <i>kar1-1</i> cells also contained Nup82-mCherry as a marker for nuclear pores. As controls, we used the shuttling 40S assembly factor Enp1 and the non-shuttling nucleolar protein Gar1 fused to GFP. Whereas Gar1-GFP was never seen in the nucleus of <i>kar1-1</i> cells (red signal), both Enp1-GFP and Slx9-GFP localized to both nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

However, this complex was impaired in loading Crm1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, compare lane 5 and 9). Therefore, we suggest that Slx9 promotes assembly of a Crm1-export complex on Rio2, and that this function relies on a proper interaction between Slx9 and RanGTP."

Structural analyses of the RanGTP:Crm1 complex bound to prototypic NESs suggest that any peptide can function as a NES as long as its backbone conformation permits its side chains to access the rigid hydrophobic pockets of Crm1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">G\u00fcttler et al., 2010</a>). To test whether conformational rigidity of the Rio2-NES is critical to recruit Crm1 in the presence of Ran<sup>QL</sup>GTP, three consecutive residues (399-EEN-401) proximal to the NES were mutated to glycines (Rio2<sup>3G</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, top panel). Because glycine residues lack a side chain, they allow greater conformational flexibility for the polypeptide backbone of these residues (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968</a>) as well as to the neighboring NES, thus destabilizing it. We found that, like the Rio2<sup>\u2206NES</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, lane 8), Rio2<sup>3G</sup> was unable to cooperatively recruit Crm1 in the presence of Ran<sup>QL</sup>GTP in vitro (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, bottom panel, lane 4).

Despite their low affinity in vitro, NES-containing cargos are exported efficiently in vivo (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kutay and G\u00fcttinger, 2005</a>). Because they are amongst the most abundant export cargos in a eukaryotic cell and require rapid, sustained rates of export; pre-ribosomal particles are particularly sensitive to the interactions between the NES and Crm1 (<a href=\"#bib89\">Zemp and Kutay, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Panse and Johnson, 2010</a>). Here, we identify Slx9 as a RanGTP-binding protein that stabilizes the interaction between RanGTP, Rio2, and Crm1 without promoting cooperative binding between these proteins. Instead, Slx9 overcomes the low affinity between the NES and Crm1 and drives stepwise assembly of a Crm1-export complex on the NES-containing adaptor Rio2 of the 40S pre-ribosomal cargo."

A stepwise formation of a Crm1-export complex could allow currently uncharacterized quality control surveillance steps to monitor pre-ribosome assembly and ensure that only correctly assembled particles are chosen for export.

In support of the proposed NES-conformer selection model, a destabilized NES of Rio2<sup>3G</sup> was unable to bind Crm1 in the presence of RanGTP in vitro.

This stabilization provides a mechanism to overcome the weak binding of NESs to Crm1, driving Crm1-complex assembly and guaranteeing efficient cargo export into the cytoplasm. One prediction of the NES-conformer selection model would be that NESs with favorable conformations exhibit improved affinity to Crm1. Slx9 may belong to a family of yet-unidentified RanGTP-binding proteins that induce and stabilize NES-conformers upon binding export cargos.

Whereas much is known about export of the large ribosomal subunit, export of the small subunit has remained enigmatic. It is well established that it depends on Crm1 but essential Crm1 ligands have not been identified. This has led to the suggestion that export factors for the small subunit are redundant. In this work, the authors identify Slx9 as a factor that interacts with Ran-GTP and the NES-containing pre-40S factor Rio2 to recruit Crm1. The data are clearly presented and, for the most part, support the general claims of the authors. However, there are several inconsistencies in the data and interpretation that warrant clarification. While many of these can probably be handled by additional explanations, two points are likely to require new experiments. First, the conclusion of a ternary complex of Slx9-RanGTP-Rio2 is not strongly supported.

The authors used immobilized Rio2 to pull down either RanGTP directly, or Slx9 followed by RanGTP. The fact they recover RanGTP in the latter could be due to its direct interaction with immobilized Rio2, either because Rio2 was not completely saturated with Slx9, or because RanGTP simply competed off some bound Slx9. It is therefore unclear how this result permits conclusion of a ternary complex. Indeed, in a situation where all pairwise combinations can interact, such GST-pulldowns will not be convincing and other methods are warranted (e.g., gel filtration, gel shift assays, or sequential affinity steps against two of the proteins recovering the third). Alternatively, a well-controlled and quantitative titration of Slx9 to show that it does not inhibit the binding of Ran-GTP could also argue against mutually exclusive binding."

However, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> shows that a trimeric complex containing only Rio2-Ran-GTP and Crm1 assembles efficiently in the absence of Slx9. In fact, in that complex, Crm1 appears to enhance Ran binding, suggesting cooperativity of binding. The same components appear to be present in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> lane 4 but now we do not see Crm1 binding. What accounts for this difference?

The distribution and evolutionary conservation of the Slx9 proteins has not been reported to date. Indeed, it was previously suggested that Slx9 homologs are limited to yeast species (Bax et al RNA 2006). After one referee performed some limited multiple sequence alignments between putative vertebrate FAM207A homologs and the <i>pombe</i> and <i>cerevisiae</i> Slx9 proteins, he/she did not find the level of amino acid conservation convincing. Particularly in view of the previous report (Bax et al), the authors should show evidence for the phylogenetic distribution and amino acid conservation of the Slx9 proteins beyond yeast. Related to this, the authors show that FAM207A binds Ran<sup>QL</sup>GTP in vitro. However, this observation in isolation is not convincing since cofractionation with ribosomes or requirement for 40S subunit export are not analyzed. The authors should either be more cautious about the claim that FAM207A is the functional human Slx9 homolog or more robustly support this conclusion."

Because glycine residues lack a side chain, they allow greater conformational flexibility for the polypeptide backbone of these residues (Ramachandran G N, Sasisekharan V, 1968 Adv Protein Chem) as well as to the neighboring NES, thus destabilizing it. Therefore, introduction of glycines are expected to lower the affinity of an NES for Crm1 by locally disturbing the secondary structure that is important to orient and insert the residues of the NES into the hydrophobic pockets of Crm1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">G\u00fcttler et al., 2010</a> NSMB). A short explanation has now been included in the text."
