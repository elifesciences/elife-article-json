Targeted disruption of <i>CatSper\u03b6</i> reduces CatSper current and sperm rheotactic efficiency in mice, resulting in severe male subfertility. Normally distributed in linear quadrilateral nanodomains along the flagellum, the complex lacking CatSper\u03b6 is disrupted at ~0.8 \u03bcm intervals along the flagellum. This disruption renders the proximal flagellum inflexible and alters the 3D flagellar envelope, thus preventing sperm from reorienting against fluid flow <i>in vitro</i> and efficiently migrating <i>in vivo</i>. Ejaculated <i>CatSper\u03b6</i>-null sperm cells retrieved from the mated female uterus partially rescue <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF) that failed with epididymal spermatozoa alone. Human CatSper\u03b5 is quadrilaterally arranged along the flagella, similar to the CatSper complex in mouse sperm. We speculate that the newly identified CatSper\u03b6 subunit is a late evolutionary adaptation to maximize fertilization inside the mammalian female reproductive tract."
