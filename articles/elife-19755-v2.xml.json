Here, we identified an atypical protease of the subtilase family [SBT5.2(b)] that attenuates the transcriptional activation of plant defence independently of its protease activity. The <i>SBT5.2</i> gene produces two distinct transcripts encoding a canonical secreted subtilase [SBT5.2(a)] and an intracellular protein [SBT5.2(b)]. Concomitant to <i>SBT5.2(a)</i> downregulation, <i>SBT5.2(b)</i> expression is induced after bacterial inoculation. SBT5.2(b) localizes to endosomes where it interacts with and retains the defence-related transcription factor MYB30. Nuclear exclusion of MYB30 results in its reduced transcriptional activation and, thus, suppressed resistance. <i>sbt5.2</i> mutants, with abolished <i>SBT5.2(a)</i> and <i>SBT5.2(b)</i> expression, display enhanced defence that is suppressed in a <i>myb30</i> mutant background. Moreover, overexpression of SBT5.2(b), but not SBT5.2(a), in <i>sbt5.2</i> plants reverts the phenotypes displayed by <i>sbt5.2</i> mutants. Overall, we uncover a regulatory mode of the transcriptional activation of defence responses previously undescribed in eukaryotes."

Here, we identified an atypical protease of the subtilase family [SBT5.2(b)] that attenuates the transcriptional activation of plant defence independently of its protease activity. The <i>SBT5.2</i> gene produces two distinct transcripts encoding a canonical secreted subtilase [SBT5.2(a)] and an intracellular protein [SBT5.2(b)]. Concomitant to <i>SBT5.2(a)</i> downregulation, <i>SBT5.2(b)</i> expression is induced after bacterial inoculation. SBT5.2(b) localizes to endosomes where it interacts with and retains the defence-related transcription factor MYB30. Nuclear exclusion of MYB30 results in its reduced transcriptional activation and, thus, suppressed resistance. <i>sbt5.2</i> mutants, with abolished <i>SBT5.2(a)</i> and <i>SBT5.2(b)</i> expression, display enhanced defence that is suppressed in a <i>myb30</i> mutant background. Moreover, overexpression of SBT5.2(b), but not SBT5.2(a), in <i>sbt5.2</i> plants reverts the phenotypes displayed by <i>sbt5.2</i> mutants. Overall, we uncover a regulatory mode of the transcriptional activation of defence responses previously undescribed in eukaryotes."

When a plant detects an invading microbe, it massively changes which genes it expresses to establish a defensive response.

However, triggering such a response comes at a cost, and so plants must keep their defensive response in check such that they can allocate resources in a balanced way."

The first is a classical subtilase that is indeed located outside of the cell, and so cannot interact with MYB30 and does not affect its activity. The second protein is an atypical subtilase that localises to bubble-like compartments called vesicles within the cell and is able to highjack MYB30 on its way to the nucleus. When the atypical subtilase interacts with MYB30 at vesicles, it stops MYB30 from entering the nucleus. As a result, MYB30 cannot bind to the DNA nor activate its target genes. This means that the defensive response that normally depends on MYB30 is weakened."

Indeed, proteases of different families have been shown to be involved in the control of metabolism, physiology, growth and adaptive responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli (<a href=\"#bib66\">van der Hoorn, 2008</a>). Subtilisin-like proteases (subtilases) are serine proteases featuring a catalytic triad characterized by the three amino acids aspartate, histidine and serine (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dodson\u00a0and\u00a0Wlodawer, 1998</a>). According to the MEROPS (<a href=\"http://merops.sanger.ac.uk\">http://merops.sanger.ac.uk</a>) classification, subtilases belong to the S8 family within the SB clan of serine proteases and are grouped into two subfamilies, subtilisins (S8A) and kexins (S8B). Nine subtilases have been characterized in mammals, seven of which belong to the kexin group and two others to the S8A subfamily (pyrolysins). With no representatives of the kexin type, plant subtilases exclusively belong to the pyrolysin group within the S8A subfamily. Pyrolysin-related subtilase families are largely expanded throughout the plant kingdom with a degree of complexity that exceeds that of their mammalian counterparts (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schaller et al., 2012</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis</i> the subtilase family comprises 56 members distributed in six distinct subgroups (SBT1-6) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rautengarten et al., 2005</a>). Despite their prevalence, our knowledge of the function of plant subtilases is rather poor. Subtilases are predicted to be secreted and have been involved in general protein turnover as well as in the\u00a0highly specific regulation of plant development or responses to environmental changes and, more recently, in suppression of basal immunity and immune priming (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schaller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Figueiredo et al., 2014</a>)."

Plants, unlike mammals, lack mobile defender cells and a somatic adaptive immune system. Instead, they rely on the innate immunity of each cell and on systemic signals originating from infection sites. Plant resistance to disease is a costly response, closely connected to plant physiological and developmental processes, and often associated with the so-called hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death that develops at attempted infection sites, allegedly to prevent pathogen propagation through the plant (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coll et al., 2011</a>). The sharp limit of the HR suggests the existence of tight regulatory mechanisms to restrict cell death development to the inoculated zone although the molecular actors involved in this process remain unknown for the most part. In line with the high cellular cost of triggering defence and cell death-associated responses, negative regulatory mechanisms are used by the plant to attenuate the activation of immune-related functions and allow a balanced allocation of resources upon pathogen challenge."

MYB TFs of the R2R3 type (126 members in <i>Arabidopsis</i>) mostly regulate plant-specific functions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dubos et al., 2010</a>). Among the MYB TFs regulating defence-related transcription, <i>Arabidopsis</i> MYB30 is one of the best characterized. MYB30 promotes defence and cell death-associated responses through the transcriptional activation of genes related to the lipid biosynthesis pathway that leads to the production of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Raffaele et al., 2008</a>). MYB30 is targeted by the effector protein XopD, from the bacterial pathogen <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris (Xcc</i>), leading to suppression of MYB30-mediated transcriptional activation of plant resistance and thus underlining the important role played by MYB30 in plant defence regulation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Canonne et al., 2011</a>)."

Here, we describe SBT5.2, a serine protease of the subtilisin group, as a new MYB30-interacting partner. We demonstrate that the <i>SBT5.2</i> transcript is alternatively spliced and that one of the two <i>SBT5.2</i> splice variants, SBT5.2(b), whose expression pattern follows that of <i>MYB30</i> after bacterial treatment, encodes an atypical subtilase that specifically mediates retention of MYB30 at endosomal vesicles. This phenomenon is independent of the integrity of the SBT5.2(b) catalytic triad, requires N-terminal myristoylation of SBT5.2(b) and results in attenuation of MYB30-mediated HR. Our work uncovers a novel regulatory mode for a subtilase protein and underlines the intricacy of the transcriptional regulation of plant responses to pathogen attack."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, expression of <i>SBT5.2(a)</i> was downregulated after treatment with bacteria, whereas expression of <i>SBT5.2(b)</i> was induced and displayed an expression profile highly similar to that of <i>MYB30</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>).

We focused on the study of the interaction between MYB30 and SBT5.2(b) because we were unable to detect a subcelullar co-localisation between MYB30 (nuclear) and SBT5.2(a) (secreted) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a,b</a>), which is a first requisite for the study of protein-protein interactions. The physical interaction between SBT5.2(b) and MYB30 was investigated in FRET-FLIM assays using GFP- (donor) and RFP- (acceptor) tagged MYB30 and SBT5.2(b), respectively. In order to avoid potential changes in GFP lifetime due to differences in the molecular environments of two distinct subcellular compartments [MYB30 being nuclear when expressed alone or in vesicle-like structures when co-expressed with SBT5.2(b)], the subcellular localization of GFP-tagged MYB30 when co-expressed with non-fluorescent HA-tagged, or an untagged version of SBT5.2(b), was therefore investigated. Importantly, both SBT5.2(b)-HA and untagged SBT5.2(b), which are not able to act as acceptors for GFP fluorescence, also led to MYB30 retention in intracellular vesicle-like structures (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>). A significant reduction of GFP lifetime was observed when GFP-MYB30 was co-expressed with RFP-tagged SBT5.2(b) as compared to co-expression with SBT5.2(b)-HA, both in <i>N. benthamiana</i> epidermal cells and in Arabidopsis protoplasts, thus confirming the physical interaction between the two proteins in intracellular vesicles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,d</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This interaction did not depend on the integrity of SBT5.2(b) catalytic triad, as shown by the reduced GFP lifetime of GFP-MYB30 when co-expressed with RFP-tagged SBT5.2(b)<sup>H171A</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>)."

Finally, co-expression of SBT5.2(b)<sup>162-730</sup>-RFP, RFP-SBT5.2(b) or SBT5.2(b)<sup>G2A</sup> RFP with GFP-MYB30 did not affect MYB30 nuclear targeting (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). Interestingly, MYB30 accumulation in the cytoplasm was enhanced in the presence of these SBT5.2(b) versions, consistent with the presence in the three proteins of an intact SBT5.2 C-terminal domain that mediates the interaction with MYB30 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). An HA-tagged SBT5.2(b)<sup>G2A</sup> version induced the same effect confirming that the enhanced detection of GFP-MYB30 in the cytoplasm is not an artefact due the presence of a second fluorophore.

Myristoylation of SBT5.2(b) appears to be essential to this effect, since expression of SBT5.2(b)<sup>G2A</sup> did not affect the discrete endosomal populations tagged by VHA-a1 or ARA6 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

In humans, the importance of AS is clearly highlighted by the fact that about 15% of genetic hereditary diseases are caused by mutations that affect splicing (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kornblihtt et al., 2013</a>). In plants, AS plays fundamental roles in regulating plant growth, development, and responses to environmental signals (<a href=\"#bib56\">Staiger and Brown, 2013</a>). A genome-wide transcriptomic analysis in Arabidopsis plants inoculated with bacteria uncovered a surprisingly large number of AS events (<a href=\"#bib27\">Howard et al., 2013</a>). Although we are still far from understanding the functional implications of this transcriptome complexity, the function of numerous plant resistance genes, encoding immune receptors, appears to be regulated by AS (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gassmann, 2008</a>). To our knowledge, our work represents the first described example of AS affecting the function of a protein of the subtilase family. AS of <i>SBT5.2</i> results in the production of the atypical subtilase SBT5.2(b), uncovering a novel mode of regulation of defence reactions and contributing to further our understanding of the varied roles of AS in the control of plant immunity."

This idea is reinforced by the observed co-regulation of <i>SBT5.2(b)</i> and <i>MYB30</i> expression after bacterial treatment. Despite their pervasiveness, our current understanding of the functions of plants subtilases is still limited. Different studies suggest a role in both general protein turnover and regulation of plant development or responses to environmental cues (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schaller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Figueiredo et al., 2014</a>). The first example of a plant subtilase potentially acting during plant-pathogen interactions was reported in tomato, where the\u00a0expression of the subtilases <i>P69B</i> and <i>P69C</i> was induced by pathogen infection and treatment with salycilic acid (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jord\u00e1 et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tornero et al., 1997</a>).

In addition, using mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cedzich et al., 2009</a>) and structural analyses (<a href=\"#bib41\">Murayama et al., 2012</a>), plant subtilases were shown to be glycosylated in the secretory pathway and to accumulate extracellularly (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schaller et al., 2012</a>). In agreement with the preproprotein structure, the maturation of the active enzyme from its inactive precursor requires at least two processing steps. After cleavage of the SP, subtilases are ultimately activated by cleavage of the PD producing the mature active enzyme (<a href=\"#bib60\">Taylor et al., 1997</a>). Processing of the PD, an auto-inhibitor domain of plant subtilases (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nakagawa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Meyer et al., 2016</a>), is an intramolecular autocatalytic reaction that occurs late in the ER or in the early Golgi (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cedzich et al., 2009</a>). Here, we show that AS of the <i>SBT5.2</i> gene has important implications for the subcellular localization and activity of the resulting isoforms, despite the nearly total conservation between the two protein sequences. Consistent with harbouring all canonical features of a subtilase, we confirmed that SBT5.2(a) enters the secretory pathway, where it is glycosylated, and is secreted to the extracellular space as shown before (<a href=\"#bib17\">Engineer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kaschani et al., 2012</a>). SBT5.2 was previously described as a negative regulator of stomatal density under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions through cleavage of the extracellular pro-peptide ligand EPF2 in the apoplast (<a href=\"#bib17\">Engineer et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, in agreement with its lacking a SP and the first five amino acids of the PD, SBT5.2(b) does not enter the secretory pathway, its PD is thus not cleaved and may fold onto SBT5.2(b) catalytic domain inhibiting its protease activity. Indeed, despite the presence of PGSs and catalytic residues, we were unable to detect SBT5.2(b) glycosylation or protease activity. We also showed that MYB30 accumulation <i>in planta</i> is not affected by SBT5.2(a) or SB5.2(b), indicating that these proteins do not proteolytically cleave the TF. In the case of catalytically active SBT5.2(a), this can be explained by the lack of co-localization of both proteins. Despite their subcellular co-localization and physical interaction, lack of modification of MYB30 accumulation in the presence of SBT5.2(b) is consistent with SBT5.2(b) being inactive as a protease, as underlined by the finding that both wild-type SBT5.2(b) and catalytic mutant SBT5.2(b)<sup>H171A</sup> are able to interact with and retain MYB30 at endosomal vesicles. These results suggest an alternative mode of action of SBT5.2(b) on MYB30 activity, likely related to SBT5.2(b)-mediated MYB30 nuclear exclusion. Examples of proteases playing proteolysis-independent functions have been described in mammals. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a major regulatory role in cholesterol homeostasis but does not require its catalytic activity to induce degradation of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (<a href=\"#bib38\">McNutt et al., 2007</a>). In addition, \u03b3-secretase, an aspartyl protease that performs the final proteolytic cleavage step in the processing cascade of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2APP) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vassar et al., 1999</a>), displays proteolysis-independent functions during the regulation of \u03b2APP maturation and trafficking (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wrigley et al., 2005</a>)."

Since co-expression of SBT5.2(b), but not SBT5.2(a), with both early and late endosome markers leads to colocalisation of both markers, it is tempting to speculate that SBT5.2(b) is able to interfere with endosomal trafficking leading to the formation of hybrid endosomes. In mammals, expression of constitutively active Rab5 blocks the conversion of early to late endosomes, giving rise to hybrid endosomal compartments and deregulation of autophagy (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rink et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, overexpression of Arabidopsis sorting nexin SNX2b leads to the formation of large SNX2-containing endosome aggregations, which inhibits vesicle trafficking (<a href=\"#bib46\">Phan et al., 2008</a>)."

Enhanced susceptibility of plants impaired in regulators of endosome trafficking emphasizes the importance of endocytic processes in establishing defence (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lu et al., 2012</a>). In addition, plasma membrane receptors that sense apoplastic microbes are immune-related cargos of plant trafficking pathways (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beck et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ben Khaled et al., 2015</a>), and a number of intracellular immune receptors have been shown to constitutively localize to endomembranes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Takemoto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Engelhardt et al., 2012</a>), further underlining the prominent role of endomembrane systems in determining plant resistance. Although the role of endosomes in implementing defence signalling is not yet well understood, they have been proposed as central subcellular sites for orchestration of the HR. Indeed, relocalisation of the potato resistance protein R3a from the cytoplasm to endosomal compartments is required to trigger the HR (<a href=\"#bib16\">Engelhardt et al., 2012</a>). The importance of these compartments during immunity is further underlined by the fact that both plant and animal pathogens produce inhibitory effector proteins that specifically target endomembrane trafficking. For example, the Arabidopsis ADP ribosylation factor (ARF)-Guanine exchange factor (GEF) MIN7 is targeted and degraded by the bacterial effector HopM1 altering secretory trafficking (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nomura et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2011</a>). In mammalian cells, the effector PipB2 from the bacterial pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> causes a specific redistribution of late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/Lys) compartments to the cell periphery promoting formation of <i>Salmonella</i>-induced filaments (Sifs) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Knodler and Steele-Mortimer, 2005</a>)."

Subcellular compartmentalization of the E2F TF family, either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm, is used to control cell cycle in differentiated skeletal cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gill and Hamel, 2000</a>). p53, a tightly regulated animal TF that acts as a hub for numerous signalling pathways including apoptosis, shifts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in the presence of HDM2, where it has important roles that are independent of its transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boyd et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Green and Kroemer, 2009</a>). Similarly, alternative functions for MYB30 in endosomal vesicles, other than HR regulation, cannot be excluded at this stage. In addition, nuclear import of 'dormant' TFs plays important roles in the regulation of gene expression. Upon exposure to environmental stresses, several membrane-bound TFs have been shown to be proteolytically activated by either ubiquitin-mediated proteasome activities or by specific membrane-bound proteases (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoppe et al., 2001</a>), which may facilitate triggering quick transcriptional responses to ensure plant survival under stressful conditions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Seo et al., 2010</a>). Notably, subtilases are known to be involved in the release of 'dormant' membrane-bound TFs. Arabidopsis SBT6.1 is able to cleave the ER-located TF bZIP17 that, once released, moves to the nucleus to activate transcription in response to salt stress (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2007</a>). Finally, nuclear exclusion by localization to small vesicle-like structures has been reported as a negative regulatory mechanism of TF activity. Indeed, the small interference protein MIF1, promotes nuclear exclusion of the TF ZHD5 that regulates flower architecture and leaf development. As a result, ZHD5 is relocalised into cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures, which interferes with is transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hong et al., 2011</a>)."

SBT5.2(b)-mediated nuclear exclusion of MYB30 represents an additional regulatory mode of the activity of this TF, underlining the complexity of the regulatory modes of defence-related plant cell death responses. This intricate regulation of MYB30 is reminiscent of the tight control exerted on animal TFs such as p53 that is also multi-regulated through varied modes including protein-protein interactions, ubiquitination and, notably, nuclear exclusion. This sophisticated fine-tuning, which provides an efficient means to regulate fundamental cellular processes, appears as a general feature underlying the transcriptional control in eukaryotic cells."

The detector was composed of a streak camera (Streakscope C4334, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) coupled with a fast and high sensitivity CCD camera (model C8800-53C, Hamamatsu). For each region of interest (vesicle and nucleus), average fluorescence decay profiles were plotted and lifetimes were estimated by fitting data with exponential function using a non-linear least-squares estimation procedure."

They further show that there are two splice variants, SBT5.2(a) which represents the canonical secreted subtilase, and SBT5.2(b) which lacks a signal peptide and thus fails to be secreted. SBT5.2(b) is targeted to enodosomes by N-terminal myristoylation. It interacts with MYB30 via its C-terminal domain, sequestering the transcription factor in the cytosol thus preventing nuclear localization and activation of defense. These findings are novel and highly relevant. They provide important insight into the function of subtilases and reveal a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation."

However, we failed to detect SBT5.2(b) proteins by Western blot after immunoprecipitation. Indeed, SBT5.2(b) is highly prone to degradation, likely due to lack of glycosylation (glycosylation has been described to play a role in protein stabilization and protection from degradation in both plant and animal cells). In contrast, glycosylated SBT5.2(a) is more stable both after protein extraction and in vivo (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Although we modified the incubation time and temperature to try and reduce SBT5.2(b) degradation, we did not succeed in detecting SBT5.2(b) protein (or activity) after immunoprecipitation. Under these conditions, it was thus not possible to conclude whether lack of increased fluorescence was due to lack of SBT5.2(b) protease activity or just to the fact that the protein was absent owing to degradation during immunoprecipitation. We additionally tried to express and purify the proteins in bacteria but the subtilases were systematically found in inclusion bodies, which was not compatible with activity assays."
