Here we report a novel Hif-3\u03b1 variant, Hif-3\u03b12, in zebrafish. Hif-3\u03b12 lacks the bHLH, PAS, PAC, and ODD domains and is expressed in embryonic and adult tissues independently of oxygen availability. Hif-3\u03b12 is a nuclear protein with significant hypoxia response element (HRE)-dependent transcriptional activity. Hif-3\u03b12 overexpression not only decreases embryonic growth and developmental timing but also causes left-right asymmetry defects. Genetic deletion of Hif-3\u03b12 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing increases, while Hif-3\u03b12 overexpression decreases, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. This action is independent of its HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. Mechanistically, Hif-3\u03b12 binds to \u03b2-catenin and destabilizes the nuclear \u03b2-catenin complex. This mechanism is distinct from GSK3\u03b2-mediated \u03b2-catenin degradation and is conserved in humans. These findings provide new insights into the oxygen-independent actions of HIFs and uncover a novel mechanism regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling."
