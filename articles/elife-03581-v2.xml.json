Understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying this will lead to new therapies for treating major depression. NMDARs are heteromultimeric complexes formed through association of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. We show that in vivo deletion of GluN2B, only from principal cortical neurons, mimics and occludes ketamine's actions on depression-like behavior and excitatory synaptic transmission. Furthermore, ketamine-induced increases in mTOR activation and synaptic protein synthesis were mimicked and occluded in 2B\u0394Ctx mice. We show here that cortical GluN2B-containing NMDARs are uniquely activated by ambient glutamate to regulate levels of excitatory synaptic transmission. Together these data predict a novel cellular mechanism that explains ketamine's rapid antidepressant actions. In this model, basal glutamatergic neurotransmission sensed by cortical GluN2B-containing NMDARs regulates excitatory synaptic strength in PFC determining basal levels of depression-like behavior."

Understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying this will lead to new therapies for treating major depression. NMDARs are heteromultimeric complexes formed through association of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. We show that in vivo deletion of GluN2B, only from principal cortical neurons, mimics and occludes ketamine's actions on depression-like behavior and excitatory synaptic transmission. Furthermore, ketamine-induced increases in mTOR activation and synaptic protein synthesis were mimicked and occluded in 2B\u0394Ctx mice. We show here that cortical GluN2B-containing NMDARs are uniquely activated by ambient glutamate to regulate levels of excitatory synaptic transmission. Together these data predict a novel cellular mechanism that explains ketamine's rapid antidepressant actions. In this model, basal glutamatergic neurotransmission sensed by cortical GluN2B-containing NMDARs regulates excitatory synaptic strength in PFC determining basal levels of depression-like behavior."

This allowed Miller, Yang et al. to discover that when the neurotransmitter glutamate binds to GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors, it limits the production of certain proteins that make it easier for signals to be transmitted between neurons. Suppressing the synthesis of these proteins too much may cause depressive effects by reducing communication between the neurons in the prefrontal cortex."

Understanding the cellular signaling mechanisms underlying this effect will lead to new therapeutic strategies, with the potential for enhancing beneficial actions and minimizing side effects associated with treatment regimes.

Cortical NMDARs are dominated by GluN2A and GluN2B subunits. We recently demonstrated that GluN2B-containing NMDARs act in a unique manner, distinct from GluN2A, to directly suppress mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and repress protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2011a</a>). Consistent with a role for GluN2B, selective antagonists of GluN2B-containing NMDARs are effective in producing rapid changes in behavior in both clinical patient populations and rodent models of depression (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Maeng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Preskorn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 2011</a>).

This hypothesis predicts that genetic deletion of GluN2B selectively from principal cortical neurons should mimic and occlude the actions of ketamine on depression-like behaviors and excitatory synaptic transmission. To test this, we generated animals with selective genetic knockout of GluN2B in principal cortical neurons (2B\u0394Ctx) by crossing mice with a conditional GluN2B KO allele (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brigman et al., 2010</a>) and mice expressing Cre-recombinase (Cre) under control of the NEX promoter (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goebbels et al., 2006</a>).

We also show that mTOR is present in synaptic protein fractions of cortical lysates and ketamine induces a rapid, yet transient, increase in mTOR phosphorylation, which is occluded in 2B\u0394Ctx animals. Cortical GluN2B removal also eliminated susceptibility to chronic corticosterone exposure. Furthermore, GluN2B-containing receptors can be uniquely activated by ambient glutamate, supporting a model whereby GluN2B maintains tonic suppression of protein synthesis in principal cortical neurons. In support of this, we show that modulation of glutamate transporter function, in vivo, bidirectionally regulates excitatory synaptic transmission and that enhancing glutamate transporter function suppresses depression-like behavior while increasing excitatory synaptic drive in PFC. In summary, our data suggest a novel mechanistic model for the antidepressant actions of ketamine that involves tonic activation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs in helping set basal levels of despair through regulation of protein synthesis and excitatory synaptic drive in PFC."

In PFC, 80.9 \u00b1 1.3% of neurons were GFP positive. We also noted that cre expressed strongly in both ventral and dorsal aspects of the hippocampus, in contrast to the cortex-restricted CaMKII promoter-driven cre mouse line, which lacks expression in the ventral hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib74\">Tsien et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brigman et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with previous reports characterizing this cre encoding animal (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goebbels et al., 2006</a>), we observed GFP expression in these reporter mice in pyramidal neurons in the neocortex. To confirm that this genetic manipulation resulted in loss of GluN2B-containing NMDAR-mediated current at cortical synapses, we applied whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in acute brain slices. Intra-columnar electrical stimulation in slices from PFC of control animals evoked strong synaptic currents in layer II/III pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). By voltage clamping at \u221265 mV, to maximize the Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of NMDARs and thereby isolate AMPAR-mediated current, we observed rapid onset, inward synaptic current in both genotypes confirming the presence of functional AMPAR-containing excitatory synapses. At depolarized potentials (+50 mV) these evoked synaptic responses are a mix of non-rectifying AMPAR-mediated current and slower decaying NMDAR-mediated current. Measuring the relative current carried by AMPARs to NMDARs, we observed a significant increase in this ratio in 2B\u0394Ctx animals, indicating either a decrease in NMDAR-mediated signaling, an increase in AMPAR-mediated signaling, or both (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We did not observe any differences in the decay kinetics of these AMPAR-mediated EPSCs (tau for Cont = 10.2 \u00b1 0.4 ms vs 2B\u0394Ctx = 11.4 \u00b1 3.4 ms, n.s.) nor in integrated charge transfer at \u221270 mV (Cont = 1.33 \u00b1 0.67 pC vs 2B\u0394Ctx = 1.77 \u00b1 0.53 pC, n.s.). Importantly, as predicted by the loss of GluN2B expression, sensitivity of the NMDAR-mediated current recorded at +50 mV to the GluN2B-selective antagonist ifenprodil (3 \u00b5M), which was approximately 40% in control slices, was completely lost in 2B\u0394Ctx animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Furthermore, loss in ifenprodil sensitivity was accompanied by a significant decrease in the decay tau of the receptor complex, consistent with the fact that GluN2A-containing NMDARs undergo more rapid receptor deactivation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Flint et al., 1997</a>). Together with the genetic and biochemical data, these results confirmed that GluN2B-containing NMDARs are absent in pyramidal PFC neurons in 2B\u0394Ctx mice."

To test this, we injected 2B\u0394Ctx experimental and control animals with either ketamine or saline and then measured behavior and synaptic physiology in the same animals, 30 min and 25 to 30 hr later, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consistent with our hypothesis, 2B\u0394Ctx animals exhibited a dramatic decrease in despair-like behavior when compared to littermate control animals, as measured in two behavioral tests with strong predictive ability for antidepressant effectiveness; the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Castagn\u00e9 et al., 2011</a>). In fact, the decrease in immobility scores in the FST test was so strong it precluded testing of whether or not the actions of ketamine injection were occluded in 2B\u0394Ctx animals. Suppression of immobility scores in the TST by ketamine was occluded, as predicted, in 2B\u0394Ctx mice and could be recapitulated by injection of the GluN2B-selective antagonist Ro 25\u20136981 (Ro) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We next tested the sensitivity of these animals to chronic exposure to corticosterone (25 \u00b5g/ml).

Relative to control animals, which prefer the apparent safety of the closed arms of the maze, 2B\u0394Ctx animals actually showed a reversal in this behavior, spending a significantly higher percentage of their time in the open arms of the maze, consistent with a strong reduction in anxiety in these mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Furthermore, subjecting animals to a chronic variable stress (CVS) paradigm resulted in a significant decrease in open arm time in control animals (Cont = 32.4 \u00b1 10% vs Cont + CVS = 7.2 \u00b1 1.7% p &lt; 0.05) but no change in 2B\u0394Ctx mice (2B\u0394Ctx = 86.6 \u00b1 6.7% vs 2B\u0394Ctx + CVS = 69.3 \u00b1 14.5% n.s.). Examining these mice in the open field test (OFT), we noted that changes in despair-like behavior in 2B\u0394Ctx animals could not be accounted for by increased locomotor activity. Specifically, although total baseline locomotor activity is strongly increased in these 2B\u0394Ctx animals, ketamine injection at this age caused a significant <i>suppression</i> of locomotion in both control and 2B\u0394Ctx animals, indicating a dissociation of acute NMDAR suppression from locomotor activity, and consistent with previous data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akillioglu et al., 2012</a>). At this same time point immobility scores actually decreased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Additionally, in food-restricted animals matched in age and mass to 2B\u0394Ctx animals, we observed no significant change in immobility scores showing that the smaller body mass of these animals could not account for their decreased immobility times (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We examined reward-based behavior in the sucrose preference test in these animals, interestingly we measured no significant difference in the ratio of 10% sucrose water intake to regular water by 2B\u0394Ctx mice compared to controls (Cont = 80.8 \u00b1 4.7% vs 2B\u0394Ctx = 70.5 \u00b1 7.9% n.s.). The inability to detect a difference may reflect the high basal level of sucrose consumption in control animals or could reflect a dissociation of the domains of the behavioral phenotype in 2B\u0394Ctx animals. It should be noted that cre is expressed strongly in the olfactory bulb of these conditional knockout animals, which could affect feeding behavior. Consistent with this idea, and their decreased body mass, food-deprived 2B\u0394Ctx mice showed significantly higher latency to eat in a hidden food pellet task compared to littermate food-deprived control animals (Cont = 96.1 \u00b1 19.4 s vs 2B\u0394Ctx = 309 \u00b1 74.4 s, p &lt; 0.01). Our observation that 2B\u0394Ctx mice had decreased motivation to feed based upon the hidden food pellet task as well as exhibiting longer latency to feed in non-anxiogenic, home-cage conditions (data not shown), in addition to their potentially disrupted olfactory sensitivity, complicated our ability to interpret data from a novelty suppressed feeding task (NSFT). In the NSFT, in a novel cage testing environment, we observed a strong trend to decreased latency to feed in control animals in response to ketamine injection (24 hr post-injection) as expected (Cont = 207.4 \u00b1 70.6 s vs Cont + Ket = 58.7 \u00b1 29.4 s, p = 0.17). Yet under basal conditions 2B\u0394Ctx animals actually exhibited increased latency to feed compared to littermate control animals (Cont = 40.6 \u00b1 7.1 s vs 149.1 \u00b1 45.3 s, p = 0.06). Thus, we did not further test the effect of ketamine on these animals. These data generated from FST, TST, and EPM, both under basal conditions and in response to corticosterone treatment or chronic variable stress, strongly support the idea that GluN2B-mediated signaling, in cortical pyramidal neurons, is directly involved in setting basal levels of despair-like behavior in mice. Furthermore, loss of effectiveness of ketamine in 2B\u0394Ctx animals indicates that GluN2B-mediated signaling might be required for ketamine's antidepressant actions."

                                "text": "We wondered whether or not increased synaptic activity, seen in response to ketamine injection, might be due to an increase in the number of individual excitatory synapses or modulation of the strength of existing synapses. We hypothesized that any changes observed in excitatory transmission in response to ketamine injection should be mimicked and occluded in 2B\u0394Ctx animals, if they are in fact causally related to the behavioral phenotype. We focused on the PFC due to previous observations showing antidepressant-like actions of ketamine are antagonized by local infusion of rapamycin in PFC (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2010</a>), as well as the recognized importance of this structure in major depressive disorder (MDD) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Price and Drevets, 2012</a>), and in response to behavioral challenge (<a href=\"#bib79\">Warden et al., 2012</a>). Cortical excitatory synaptic transmission was examined by preparing acute brain slices from PFC 24 hr after vehicle or ketamine injection and applying whole-cell voltage clamp recordings at a holding potential of \u221265 mV while perfusing with TTX and picrotoxin to isolate miniature AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs). These spontaneous synaptic currents result from individual neurotransmitter vesicle fusion events that are action potential independent, and therefore, allow assessment of increases or decreases in synaptic weight (amplitude) or changes in synapse number or probability of presynaptic transmitter release (frequency) under different experimental conditions. Our measurements showed that a single dose of ketamine increased excitatory synaptic neurotransmission onto layer II/III pyramidal neurons of control animals measured 24 hr after injection and this effect was mimicked and occluded in 2B\u0394Ctx animals. Increased excitatory neurotransmission was measured as an increase in the frequency (decrease in inter-event interval) of mEPSCs in ketamine-injected animals relative to saline-injected controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Importantly, this ketamine-driven increase in mEPSC frequency was occluded in 2B\u0394Ctx animals, which exhibited an increase in average baseline frequency of mEPSC events (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Behaviorally na\u00efve animals also exhibited strong increase in mEPSC events 24 hr after ketamine injection, showing that this was not an effect of the behavioral testing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In further support of a role for GluN2B signaling in ketamine's actions the selective antagonist Ro drove a similar increase in mEPSC events that correlated with decreased immobility in TST (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> c.f. 2B). The tight correlation between mEPSC frequency and immobility times in the TST strongly supports our hypothesis that excitatory synapse number in PFC contributes to setting basal levels of despair-like behavior. This prompted us to test whether or not this correlation could also be observed in corticosterone-exposed animals. Consistent with our hypothesis, we recorded a strong decrease in frequency of mEPSCs onto layer II/III pyramidal neurons in corticosterone-treated animals, compared to littermate vehicle exposed animals and this effect was absent in 2B\u0394Ctx animals, where baseline frequency of synaptic events was similar to ketamine-injected control animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Interestingly, on average, amplitude of mEPSC events in response to corticosterone treatment in either genotype were unchanged (Cont = 10.74 \u00b1 0.66 pA; Cont + Cort = 9.58 \u00b1 0.67 pA n.s.; 2B\u0394Ctx = 10.50 \u00b1 0.57 pA; 2B\u0394Ctx + Cort = 10.46 \u00b1 0.52 pA n.s.)."

Surprisingly, the dramatic increase in mEPSC event frequency in 2B\u0394Ctx animals was independent of a change in paired pulse ratio at intra-columnar II/III synapses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). While we did not test PPR at all synapses, and therefore, cannot rule out changes in presynaptic release at other contacts, our data are consistent with an increase in functional synapse number in line with previous recordings from GluN2B null neurons in hippocampal slices (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gray et al., 2011</a>). The increase in synaptic event frequency in vivo was accompanied by a decrease in average mEPSC amplitude (Cont = 11.42 \u00b1 0.97 pA vs Cont + Ket = 7.79 \u00b1 0.98 pA p &lt; 0.05). We infer this could either be due to a homeostatic down-regulation of synaptic strength in response to an increase in synapse number, or could be a reflection of insertion of young, immature synapses, which have low AMPAR content (<a href=\"#bib26\">Harris and Stevens, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zito et al., 2009</a>). In support of this latter explanation, we saw a disproportionate increase in small amplitude events when comparing saline and ketamine injected event amplitude distributions in control animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Together, these data strongly support our hypothesis that ketamine suppresses GluN2B function in pyramidal cortical neurons leading to an increase in functional excitatory synaptic number in the PFC and a decrease in despair-like behavior."

                                "text": "How are changes in synaptic physiology and behavior related to changes in protein synthesis and how does ketamine injection activate translational machinery in these cortical neurons in relation to GluN2B function? Previous results demonstrated a strong increase in cortical protein levels in response to ketamine however protein synthesis rates were not directly measured and the subunit specificity of NMDAR antagonism was not examined (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Autry et al., 2011</a>). Our hypothesis predicts that loss of tonic suppression of the translational machinery by GluN2B-containing NMDARs would increase protein synthesis rates in GluN2B null neurons. To determine whether or not GluN2B-containing NMDARs act to directly suppress protein synthesis in pyramidal cortical neurons, we prepared cultures from WT and global GluN2B KO (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kutsuwada et al., 1996</a>) cortices and analyzed rates of translation using fluorescence-based non-canonical amino acid tagging (FUNCAT) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dieterich et al., 2010</a>). Incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid AHA, which substitutes for methionine in nascent peptides during translation, was used as a measure of protein synthesis rates. After a controlled, 6-hr incubation in AHA-containing methionine-free media, neurons were fixed and AHA was fluorescently labeled. Anti-MAP2 immunostaining was used to delineate dendritic segments for analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We observed a dramatic increase in the rate of protein synthesis in GluN2B KO neurons compared to controls, consistent with our hypothesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, at these ages (11\u201314 DIV) in rodent cortical cultures both GluN2A and GluN2B protein is expressed (<a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hall et al., 2007</a>). We therefore wanted to know if the increase in protein synthesis in GluN2B KO cultures was due to loss of GluN2B <i>specifically</i>, or reduction in NMDAR-mediated current <i>generally</i>. To test this, we generated neuronal cultures from cortices of animals in which GluN2B had been genetically replaced by GluN2A (2B\u21922A) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2011a</a>). In homozygous 2B\u21922A cultures, genetic replacement of GluN2B by GluN2A was not sufficient to restore tonic suppression of translation, confirming that this is a unique function of GluN2B-containing NMDARs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These data provide direct evidence that GluN2B acts in a unique manner, under conditions of basal activity, to tonically suppress protein synthesis in cortical neurons in vitro. However, if ketamine antagonizes this cellular action, we should be able to increase protein synthesis rates by applying ketamine to control cultures. Indeed, ketamine caused a significant increase in AHA signal in dendrites of control neurons compared with non-treated cells and this increase was mimicked in 2B\u0394Ctx neurons in a manner that was sensitive to rapamycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The inability of ketamine to further increase protein synthesis rates in 2B\u0394Ctx neurons is highly suggestive that GluN2B-containing receptors are required for the effects of ketamine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Next, we asked what cellular mechanisms in vivo were responsible for these changes in protein synthesis in response to ketamine, and whether or not these changes could be mimicked by GluN2B loss of function, in vivo, in 2B\u0394Ctx animals."

Western blot analysis revealed mTOR expression in these biochemical synaptic fractions, predicting a close association between mTOR and synaptic sites (<a href=\"#bib66\">Scheetz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In response to ketamine injection, we observed a rapid yet transient increase in phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR), relative to total mTOR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Interestingly, the late-phase decrease in mTOR activation we observed coincided with decreased expression of the upstream mTOR activator Rheb, suggesting a possible negative-feedback mechanism (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,F</a>). Expression of a number of synaptic proteins in these synaptic fractions was increased, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synapse associated protein 102 (SAP-102), and the AMPAR subunit GluA1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). This is consistent with the increase in excitatory synapse number predicted by our mEPSC analysis. BDNF has been shown to regulate increases in synapse number and synapse unsilencing (<a href=\"#bib30\">Itami et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Shen and Cowan, 2010</a>) and a rapid increase in the number of immature synaptic connections is consistent with the increased expression of SAP-102 and GluA1 protein, which are associated with developmentally young synapses (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Martin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sans et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">van Zundert et al., 2004</a>). Because 2B\u0394Ctx both mimics and occludes the behavioral actions of ketamine, alterations in protein expression that are causally associated with these effects should be mimicked and occluded by GluN2B loss of function. In 2B\u0394Ctx synaptoneurosomes, we observed increased baseline levels of BDNF, SAP-102, GluA1, and p-mTOR and increased basal levels of expression of these proteins (and phosphorylation of mTOR) occluded any further increase in response to ketamine injection in 2B\u0394Ctx animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). In addition to p-mTOR, we also observed strong increases in p-P70S6K in both 2B\u0394Ctx PFC lysates and 2A\u21922B lysates from P50\u2013P70 animals compared to controls (Cont = 100 \u00b1 13.3% vs 2B\u0394Ctx = 217 \u00b1 11.4% p &lt; 0.01; WT = 100 \u00b1 34% vs 2B\u21922A = 318 \u00b1 55% p &lt; 0.05). These data strongly suggest that these increases in protein expression are driven by mTOR activation and causally related to the actions of ketamine and that these levels are regulated by GluN2B-containing NMDARs."

Despite the fact that GluN2B-selective antagonists have been shown to have antidepressant-like actions in both clinical and preclinical studies, the exact role of GluN2B-containing NMDARs has remained unclear. From our FUNCAT data, we infer that GluN2B-containing NMDARs function under non-stimulated conditions to tonically suppress protein synthesis in a manner that is not rescued by replacement with GluN2A. From these observations, we hypothesized that GluN2B-containing NMDARs might be selectively activated under basal, non-stimulated, conditions. If this receptor pool is uniquely tonically active, this would explain why either GluN2B-selective or non-selective pan-NMDAR antagonists have the same effect of promoting protein synthesis. Consistent with this idea, spontaneous, non-synchronized transmitter release has been shown to be sufficient in vitro to limit protein synthesis in cortical neurons including through suppression of mTOR (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sutton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2011a</a>). However, in addition to synaptically released glutamate, there is strong evidence supporting the presence of persistent, low-level ambient glutamate in vivo and in brain slices (<a href=\"#bib47\">Meldrum, 2000</a>).

To examine this, we first perfused WT-cultured cortical neurons with TTX, to block synchronized transmitter release, and DNQX and picrotoxin to block AMPAR and GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents, respectively, then washed in 0Mg<sup>2+</sup> ACSF. This revealed a tonic current evident as a reliable increase in the signal noise of the holding current (root mean square signal\u2014RMS) at V<sub>hold</sub> \u221265 mV. The increase in tonic current was suppressed by APV, demonstrating its dependence upon NMDAR activation, and by ifenprodil, supporting the prediction that GluN2B-containing NMDARs are selectively activated by ambient glutamate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To further verify the subunit specificity of this NMDAR-mediated response, we next examined its presence in our genetically modified neurons. Strikingly, in a manner consistent with selective activation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs, the ambient glutamate-activated tonic current was absent in GluN2B null cultures, as well as in cells where NMDARs levels have been restored but GluN2B was genetically replaced by GluN2A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This tonic current could also be evoked in acute cortical slices and was completely antagonized by ketamine application or by the GluN2B selective antagonist ifenprodil but was not suppressed by Zn<sup>2+</sup>, which is a strong and selective GluN2A antagonist at low concentrations (250 nM) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We also saw that the tonic current activated by ambient glutamate in 0Mg<sup>2+</sup> was lost in 2B\u0394Ctx slices (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Finally, we generated mosaic GluN2B knockout conditions in PFC by in vivo injection of a GFP-Cre expressing AAV virus under the CaMKII promoter into homozygous conditional GluN2B KO animals and recorded tonic current in acute brain slices. In these GluN2B null neurons, we also noted that 0Mg<sup>2+</sup> conditions generated no increase in RMS signal yet GluN2A-containing receptors could be activated under these conditions as perfusion of these slices with 25 \u00b5M NMDA in 0Mg<sup>2+</sup> saline, resulted in a strong increase in RMS signal (baseline ACSF = 1.29 \u00b1 0.18, n = 7; 0Mg<sup>2+</sup> = 1.25 \u00b1 0.15, n = 11; 0Mg<sup>2+</sup> + 25 \u00b5M NMDA = 2.88 \u00b1 0.60, n = 5; p &lt; 0.001 c.f. baseline). Furthermore, the average holding current increased to 352 \u00b1 103.9 pA (n = 3) after 100 s of continued slow perfusion with NMDA. These data confirm that ambient glutamate is sufficient (both in acute brain slices and primary neuronal cultures) to activate a uniquely sensitive population of GluN2B-containing NMDARs on cortical neurons that can be antagonized by ketamine."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, pre-treatment with the glutamate transporter antagonist dl-TBOA resulted in a significant increase in the tonic current evoked in 0Mg<sup>2+</sup>, while the EAAT enhancer nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boston-Howes et al., 2008</a>) significantly suppressed the strength of this GluN2B-mediated tonic current. Because our in vivo data predict an inverse relationship between GluN2B activation and synapse number, we then determined whether or not manipulation of this current in cultured neurons alters mEPSC frequency. We pretreated cultures with dl-TBOA, to increase ambient glutamate concentration, or with NDGA or ceftriaxone (24 hr and 1 week, respectively), to enhance EAAT function and decrease ambient glutamate (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rothstein et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rasmussen et al., 2011</a>). Unfortunately, chronic NDGA application turned out to be lethal to the cultured cells so only ceftriaxone was testable in the chronic experiments. In line with our prediction, the frequency of mEPSC events measured in pyramidal cortical neurons increased in response to 24 hr NDGA treatment and decreased dramatically in response to antagonism of glutamate re-uptake by dl-TBOA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). At this timepoint, however, ceftriaxone caused no significant increase in mEPSC frequency, perhaps owing to the mechanism of its action, which involves increasing translation and membrane insertion of EAATs, rather than direct enhancement of existing transporters. However, after 1 week of treatment ceftriaxone-treated cells showed dramatically increased mEPSC frequency. Cells treated with TBOA, which were otherwise healthy, were silenced after 7 days of treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These data show that regulation of tonic glutamate levels can affect synapse function in cortical networks and that modulation of extracellular glutamate uniquely activates GluN2B-containing NMDARs to regulate excitatory synaptic drive in cortical neurons. Based upon our in vitro results, we therefore hypothesized that enhancing glutamate transporter function should suppress depression-like behavior and increase mEPSC frequency, in vivo. To test this, we injected animals with either NDGA (acute) or Ceftriaxone (chronic) to increase EAAT function or expression, respectively (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rothstein et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mineur et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boston-Howes et al., 2008</a>). Supporting our model, we observed decreased depression-like behavior in TST in these experimental animals compared to vehicle injected control animals, as well as a corresponding increase in mEPSC frequency in PFC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Taken together these data strongly supporting a role for tonic activation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs in setting basal levels of despair-like behavior."

Our data suggest this involves regulation of mTOR downstream of GluN2B. Consistent with our hypothesis that these receptors are involved in the rapid actions of ketamine, restricted genetic removal of GluN2B from cortical pyramidal neurons decreased basal despair-like behavior, occluded the actions of ketamine, and suppressed the increase in depression-like behavior associated with chronic exposure to corticosterone. These studies extend our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the rapid anti-depressant actions of ketamine while providing a novel genetic animal model for depression studies. Importantly, they provide a novel mechanistic framework for interpreting the relationships between ambient glutamate, basal GluN2B-signaling, excitatory cortical neurotransmission, and behavioral despair."

This observation led to the \u2018initiation and adaptation\u2019 hypothesis of depression treatment (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hyman and Nestler, 1996</a>). According to this theory, treatment initiates an adaptive response leading to the delayed, yet consequential, effects of pharmacological intervention. This may involve alterations in NMDAR function. Consistent with a role for NMDARs in MDD, inescapable stress has been shown to lead to disruptions in NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity concurrent with induction of behavioral depression-like behavior (<a href=\"#bib73\">Trullas and Skolnick, 1990</a>). Moreover, SSRI treatment can lead to an adaptation of the NMDAR-mediated response (<a href=\"#bib68\">Skolnick et al., 1996</a>), decreases in expression of NMDAR subunits (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nowak et al., 1996</a>) and expression of NMDAR encoding mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Boyer et al., 1998</a>)."

A critical question is how does <i>suppression</i> of NMDAR function <i>promote</i> protein synthesis to enhance synaptic function? Previous explanations have proposed circuit-level hypotheses in which NMDAR antagonism preferentially acts upon inhibitory GABAergic neurons leading to an <i>indirect</i> increase in firing in principal neurons, release of BDNF, and increased synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stefani and Moghaddam, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Duman et al., 2012</a>). Our data suggest that ketamine acts <i>directly</i> on principal cortical neurons to remove basal suppression of mTOR-mediated protein synthesis by antagonism of GluN2B-containing NMDARs. In support of this, our data reveal strong suppression of depression-like behavior in mice lacking GluN2B specifically in pyramidal cortical neurons. These two mechanistic explanations are not mutually exclusive and could actually work together: initial increases in protein synthesis due to suppression of NMDAR function activates mTOR and promotes an increase in synapse number in PFC while increased network activity, increased glutamate release, or repeated activation of these contacts by spontaneous activity, might be required for stabilization (<a href=\"#bib49\">Moghaddam et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McKinney et al., 1999</a>). Consistent with this model, it is known that antagonism of AMPARs, which would prevent stabilization of new contacts, blocks the antidepressant actions of ketamine (<a href=\"#bib44\">Maeng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33a\">Koike et al., 2011</a>). We also have preliminary data to support this idea as we find that the AMPAR antagonist DNQX does not block the rapid increase in FUNCAT signal (i.e., increased protein synthesis) after ketamine exposure but does block the increase in spine density (i.e., stability of contacts) in, in vitro cortical cultures, 24 hr after exposure to ketamine. Also in line with this mTOR based model is the understanding that GSK-3 inhibition promotes ketamine's actions via augmentation of mTORC1 activation, while constitutively active GSK-3 mice are insensitive to ketamine's antidepressant-like actions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Beurel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). It will be interesting in future experiments, therefore, to test the relative roles of these pathways in regulating excitatory synapse number in PFC and behavior while exploring potential links between GluN2B and GSK-3-mediated signaling. In terms of additional downstream effectors, we have also shown recently that protein synthesis can be suppressed by SynGAP signaling via inhibition of mTOR and that this is unique to GluN2B-containing NMDARs (<a href=\"#bib78a\">Wang et al., 2013</a>)."

Interestingly, we also observed a decrease in the mTOR upstream activator Rheb in ketamine-treated cortex 3\u20136 hr after ketamine injection. Rheb is an immediate early gene and a strong activator of the mTOR kinase (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yamagata et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Garami et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</a>). This suggests that Rheb itself may be regulated at a translational level, which is supported by the observation that Rheb mRNA is present in forebrain neuronal dendrites (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cajigas et al., 2012</a>). Additional studies will be required to determine the full complement of proteins whose expression is altered in response to ketamine. Our data show increased levels of SAP-102 and GluR1 following ketamine injection, suggesting a rapid increase in new, excitatory synapses in layer II/III of prefrontal cortex since these proteins are associated with young synapses (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Martin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sans et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">van Zundert et al., 2004</a>).

In addition, BDNF can enhance pre-synaptic function (<a href=\"#bib27\">Henry et al., 2012</a>). Our biochemical data show mTOR is localized close to synapses, as evident by its presence in our synaptoneurosome preparations. This is in line with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib66\">Scheetz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2010</a>) and implies that protein synthesis, in response to ketamine, might be occurring locally in dendritic compartments. Local protein synthesis maintains proper levels of synaptic strength in cortical and hippocampal neurons and this regulation has been implicated in regimes of homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ju et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sutton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aoto et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2011a</a>). In light of this, other cellular regulators of dendritic protein synthesis and homeostatic synaptic plasticity need to be examined in relation to ketamine's actions, including mRNA binding proteins FMRP (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ashley et al., 1993</a>), CPEB (<a href=\"#bib61\">Richter, 2007</a>), and translational regulators retinoic acid (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wang et al., 2011b</a>), and eIF4E (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gkogkas et al., 2012</a>)."

This phenotypic discrepancy, if not due to sex, age, or mouse strain differences, is most likely due to differences in the spatial expression pattern of Cre-recombinase protein. While NEX-Cre results in developmental excision of GluN2B and CaMKII-promoter driven Cre does not (<a href=\"#bib74\">Tsien et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Goebbels et al., 2006</a>), this is unlikely to be solely responsible for the different phenotypes since the antidepressant actions of ketamine are evoked by acute treatment (<a href=\"#bib57\">Preskorn et al., 2008</a>). This suggests that the specificity of the genetic knockout in cortical structures is responsible for this discrepancy. Indeed, cortical lysates from CaMKII-driven Cre animals contain more residual GluN2B protein, supporting the interpretation of a wider distribution of Cre expression in 2B\u0394Ctx animals (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brigman et al., 2010</a>). Another notable difference is that Cre-driven gene excision is restricted to the dorsal hippocampus in the CaMKII animal (<a href=\"#bib74\">Tsien et al., 1996</a>). Suppression of GluN2B function in the ventral hippocampus of Nex-Cre based 2B\u0394Ctx animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) likely contributes to the behavioral phenotype we observe as activity in ventral dentate strongly regulates anxiety (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kheirbek et al., 2013</a>). Future experiments will require more precise targeting of specific brain regions and cell types to determine their role in aspects of the GluN2B KO phenotype. Of course, potential developmental changes induced by GluN2B knockout should not be ruled out especially in light of the importance of circuit maturation changes in vulnerability to mood disorders (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stefani and Moghaddam, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ansorge et al., 2007</a>). The absence of a positive effect on sucrose intake in the SPT in the 2B\u0394Ctx animals is also notable, as this hedonic behavior is considered a domain of the depression-like phenotype in preclinical models. Interestingly, recent elegant experiments have shown a critical and specific role for synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens in sucrose intake in SPT in mice (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lim et al., 2012</a>). The absence of any Cre expression in this nucleus in the 2B\u0394Ctx mice (data not shown) may explain this observation while also supporting the idea that these phenotypic domains can be separated in preclinical models of depression."

                        "text": "There is strong evidence supporting the presence of persistent, low-level ambient glutamate both in vivo and in brain slices (<a href=\"#bib47\">Meldrum, 2000</a>) and NMDARs can be activated by ambient glutamate in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sah et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Papouin et al., 2012</a>). Our data show that a tonic NMDAR-mediated current can be evoked in cortical neurons both in culture and acute brain slices. Strikingly, this current is absent in GluN2B null cortical neurons and in neurons in which GluN2B has been genetically replaced with GluN2A (2B\u21922A). This shows that endogenous GluN2B receptors are more sensitive to ambient glutamate than those containing GluN2A. Indeed, GluN2B-containing NMDARs have higher sensitivity to agonist, a shifted Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib52\">Mori and Mishina, 1995</a>) and higher concentrations of NMDA and d-serine are required to evoke equal current in neurons expressing only GluN2A-containing NMDARs (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2011a</a>). Furthermore, it is still unclear exactly how endogenous proteins regulate NMDAR function in situ, compared to heterologous expression studies. Levels of ambient, extracellular glutamate are tightly regulated by glutamate transporters especially EAAT2 (GLT-1), which is highly expressed on glial cells (<a href=\"#bib62\">Rothstein et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guo et al., 2003</a>). While the absolute concentration and role ambient glutamate is highly debated, our data show that basal activation of GluN2B signaling is functionally relevant and can tonically suppress protein synthesis in these neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Furthermore, in support of a role for tonic NMDAR signaling in regulating excitatory synapse function, we show that mEPSC frequency changes in a predicted manner when glutamate transporter function is chronically altered under standard Mg<sup>2+</sup> in cortical cultures maintained at 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Thus, we propose that ambient glutamate suppresses protein synthesis in a GluN2B-dependent manner in order to maintain synapse number in cortical neurons and thereby contribute to setting levels of despair-like behavior. This model is consistent with the strong association between decreased glial/glutamate transporter function and depression. This includes evidence that EAAT expression is decreased by exposure to learned-helplessness in rats (<a href=\"#bib83\">Zink et al., 2010</a>), a decrease in glial density observed in the PFC of chronically stressed animals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Banasr and Duman, 2008</a>), decreased glial density in postmortem assessment of PFC in depressed subjects (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rajkowska and Miguel-Hidalgo, 2007</a>), glial retraction from synapses induced by stress (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boudaba et al., 2003</a>), and induction of depression-like behavior through chemical ablation of glial cells in PFC in mouse (<a href=\"#bib6\">Banasr and Duman, 2008</a>). The strongest support for this hypothesis comes from experiments in which transporter function is manipulated in vivo. As our data show, acute increase in EAAT function (NDGA) and increasing EAAT expression (ceftriaxone) in vivo result in decreased immobility in TST and a corresponding increase in frequency of mEPSCs in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the PFC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). NDGA and ceftriaxone have multiple functional effects; however, since they have no published common targets (other than in enhancing EAAT2-mediated glutamate uptake), the most likely explanation we have at this time is that they are both acting through a common pathway to enhance tonic GluN2B activation and cause the resultant downstream effects we observe in behavior."

Since this receptor pool is uniquely tied to regulation of protein synthesis, it could prove to be an important target for antidepressant therapy and other disorders associated with dysregulation of protein synthesis. Recent reports have shown that NMDARs are activated by distinct co-agonists: d-serine for GluN2A and glycine for GluN2B-containing receptors (<a href=\"#bib54\">Papouin et al., 2012</a>). While our data show that GluN2B-containing NMDARs are selectively activated by ambient glutamate, they do not distinguish between potential synaptic and extra-synaptic locations of this receptor pool, in addition, we did not examine the role of triheteromeric NMDARs in regulation of protein synthesis and maintenance of excitatory synaptic strength. Regardless of their subcellular location, however, our data strongly implicate a role for NMDARs containing GluN2B in the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine, via their ability to directly suppress mTOR signaling and limit protein synthesis in principal cortical neurons."

TST was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib17\">El Yacoubi et al., 2003</a>). Mice were suspended using adhesive tape and video recorded for 6 min.

Forced swim test was carried out as described (<a href=\"#bib56\">Porsolt et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">El Yacoubi et al., 2003</a>). Mice were introduced to a cylinder filled with room temperature water. The cylinder was 20 cm in diameter and filled about 12 cm deep to prevent mice using their tails to support themselves. Two mice were tested simultaneously with a screen to separate the cylinders. Videos were recorded from a top-mounted camera for 6 min. After the testing, mice were rubbed dry and placed under an infrared lamp for about 20 min. Immobility in the last 4 min of 6 min test session was scored blind to genotype and treatment. Open field test was conducted using Accuscan open field system. Mice were introduced into the arena at a fixed corner, and they were able to explore the arena freely. Ketamine and saline were administered via i.p. injection and ketamine concentration used was 50 mg/kg, a dose we empirically found to be necessary to elicit anti-despair-like behavior in our control animals. Consistent with other results (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lindholm et al., 2012</a>), our data showed that the effectiveness of ketamine on despair-like behavior on P50\u2013P70 mice required higher doses than reported for rats and adult mice at older ages.

All food provided was soaked in the same corticosterone containing water. Exposure began between P30 and P40. After continuous treatment for 20 days, mice were assessed in TST. The same mice were then used for mEPSC recordings. For in vivo injections, ceftriaxone was dissolved in saline and mice were injected for 20 days at 200 mg/kg as per previous reports (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mineur et al., 2007</a>) and tested in the TST on day 21 which fell between P50 and P70 consistent with the ketamine experiments. NDGA was dissolved in ethanol to 100 mg/ml and then further diluted to 10 mg/ml in olive oil. Olive oil containing 10% ethanol was used as the vehicle control. P50\u2013P70 mice were injected twice 12 hr apart with 0.1 ml of either NDGA or vehicle. 12 hr after the second injection animals were tested in the TST. In chronic variable stress paradigm P30\u2013P50 group-housed male mice were stressed in a pseudo-random order for 3 weeks using the following: cold room (2 hr at 4\u00b0C); shaker, and no bedding (1 hr at 50\u201360 rmp followed by overnight in clean cage with no bedding); warm swim and single housing (30\u00b0C for 20 min followed by overnight in single-housed cage); cold swim (20\u00b0C for 10 min); wet bedding (2 hr with wet bedding)."

To chronically alter the tonic current, we pre-treated cells for 7 days before recording. Under these conditions, NDGA caused widespread cell death, and so for these recordings, we substituted a different enhancer of EAAT function, ceftriaxone (100 \u00b5M\u2013Sigma)."

Brains were removed and immediately placed into ice-cold ACSF containing high Mg<sup>2+</sup> (8 mM) and low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.25 mM) to promote slice health. 350-\u03bcm thick coronal slices from the PFC, defined as caudal to the olfactory bulb and rostral to the commissure of the corpus callosum were obtained using a Leica VT1200 vibratome. Slices were transferred to a holding chamber where they were incubated in bicarbonate buffered ACSF at room temperature for at least 45 min before transferring to a recording chamber for whole-cell voltage clamp recording. ACSF solutions were bubbled with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub> at all times to maintain consistent oxygenation and pH. Synaptic activity was recorded from acute brain slices while perfused at room temperature in ACSF. Borosilicate glass pipettes were filled with a cesium-substituted intracellular solution as previously described (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hall et al., 2007</a>). Pipette resistances ranged 4\u20137 M\u03a9. Series access resistance ranged from 7 to 15 M\u03a9 and was monitored for consistency. Recordings were discarded if leak current rose above 300 pA. In slice recordings, layer II/III pyramidal neurons were targeted for recording. Recorded cells were confined to medial cortex in the more caudal slices (to target PrL and IL cortex) and were medial and dorsal in more rostral slices, defined by appearance of forceps minor corpus callosum, observable in live differential interference contrast images. Synaptic responses were evoked using concentric bipolar-stimulating electrodes placed approximately halfway across the cortical layers in coronal orientation to evoke stimulation of intracolumnar axons. Current decay tau values were determined using a single exponential decay function in IgorPro: y = y<sub>0</sub> + a<sup>(\u2212(x \u2212 x0/tau))</sup> and fitting between the current peak and \u039450 ms."

The authors report that in vivo deletion of GluN2B from principal cortical neurons mimics and occludes the action of ketamine on depression-related behaviors and on excitatory synaptic transmission. Ketamine-induced increases in mTOR activation in synaptic protein synthesis also were mimicked and occluded in the GluN2B mutant mice. The experiments in the last section of the paper attempt to show that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors are uniquely activated by ambient glutamate to regulate excitatory synaptic transmission. Reviewer 1 was positive about the paper: \u201cThis is an outstanding paper. It is well written, thorough, and convincing illustrates the critical role of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in the fast-acting antidepressant properties of ketamine. This paper combines genetic, pharmacological, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques to demonstrate that ketamine, an NMDA antagonist, acts to suppress GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors to promote protein synthesis and produces an antidepressant behavioral response.\u201d Reviewer 1 had two concerns (#1 and #2) below. Reviewer 2, although positive about the paper, had more serious concerns about the conclusions regarding ambient glutamate and the manipulation of transporter currents (see #3 and #4) below. We anticipate that you will either need to add some additional experiments to address the issues and/or modify your conclusions"

We used in vivo viral injection of CRE:GFP in 2B homozygous floxed animals to generate null neurons in a mosaic fashion. In acute brain slices from these animals we confirmed that 0Mg<sup>2+</sup> treatment does not result in increased RMS signal in 2B null (cre-expressing) neurons, consistent with our previous data. However, additional bath application of 25 micromolar NMDA in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> did activate a tonic current in these neurons, evident as a strong increase in holding current and increased RMS signal (see Figure #3 below). This shows indeed that GluN2A-containing NMDARs can be activated by ambient glutamate and the increased RMS signal is likely due to current flux. However, they also substantiate the hypothesis that non 2B-containing NMDRs are much more sensitive to ambient agonist. We believe the difference in sensitivity could reflect differential access to agonist due to unique subcellular localizations of the receptor subtypes and/or the presence of interacting proteins in neurons that modify sensitivity of the receptor complexes. It is notable that characteristic properties of receptor physiology are different when comparing receptors in neurons with those transiently expressed in heterologous systems. For example, while 2A-containing receptors exhibit greater open channel probability in heterologous systems, measuring the progression of activity-dependent channel block does not support the same conclusion in neurons but rather data in neurons show evidence for similar open probability kinetics (Wang et al., 2011; Speed and Dobrunz, 2009; Chavis and Westbrook, 2001).

This is further evidenced by the lack of any effect of NDGA on the 2B\u0394Ctx mice, both in mini EPSC frequency and behavior, where tonic 2B activation is not possible.
