Here we test the hypothesis that the dorsal striatum receives also GABAergic projections from the cortex. We addressed this fundamental question by taking advantage of optogenetics and directly examining the functional effects of cortical GABAergic inputs to spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the mouse auditory and motor cortex. We found that the cortex, via corticostriatal somatostatin neurons (CS-SOM), has a direct inhibitory influence on the output of the striatum SPNs. Our results describe a corticostriatal long-range inhibitory circuit (CS-SOM inhibitory projections \u2192 striatal SPNs) underlying the control of spike timing/generation in SPNs and attributes a specific function to a genetically defined type of cortical interneuron in corticostriatal communication."

However, this result made it difficult to explain why electrically stimulating the cortex can sometimes reduce or inhibit the activity of the striatum. To reconcile these facts, most people assumed that inhibition must occur when excitatory cortical neurons activate networks of inhibitory cells within the striatum itself."

These inhibitory neurons project from the auditory and motor regions of the cortex, and contain a substance called somatostatin. These neurons form connections with a specific type of striatal neuron called medium spiny neurons, which in turn project to other brain regions outside the striatum. The inhibitory cortical neurons can alter the activity of the medium spiny neurons, and can therefore directly control the output of the striatum."

Using this virus, CS-SOM neurons were retrogradely labelled with GFP, and their somata were present primarily in layers 5 and 6 of the AC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, middle). This approach allowed us to visually identify and record from layer 5 and 6 CS-SOM neurons using whole-cell patch clamp. Confocal images of biocytin-filled CS-SOM neurons showed that they are similar to SOM interneurons in their morphology and send an axonal projection into the subcortical white matter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, right; Neurolucida-reconstructed CS-SOM neuron <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). We verified their identity based on the comparison with electrophysiological properties of SOM interneurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ma et al., 2006</a>). These properties include a wide action potential and low rheobase (the smallest current step evoking an action potential) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>, top; action potentials in CS-SOM neurons, shown in black, are wider than those from fast-spiking interneurons, example in red).

After 3\u20134 weeks, we recorded from the right dorsal striatum, in which ChR2-positive axons could be observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>, right). These axons have been reported to remain photoexcitable even when severed from their parent somata (<a href=\"#bib44\">Petreanu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rock and Apicella, 2015</a>). To determine the synaptic properties of CS-SOM projections onto striatal neurons, we photoactivated CS-SOM ChR2-positive axons by flashing blue light (470 nm) for 2\u20135 ms during whole-cell recordings from striatal neurons. IPSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>, red trace) were isolated by applying a command potential of 0 mV (the calculated reversal potential for glutamatergic excitatory conductance). The IPSCs onset of the photo-evoked response was 2.2 \u00b1 0.11 ms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>, left). This latency is consistent with the IPSCs being the result of a monosynaptic inhibitory input from the cortex and not a local striatal feedback inhibitory network recruited by cortical projections. Blocking excitatory neurotransmission by application of glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX and CPP did not abolish the CS-SOM-ChR2-evoked synaptic IPSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>, magenta trace). In contrast, blocking inhibitory neurotransmission by application of gabazine (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>, black trace) completely abolished the CS-SOM-ChR2-evoked synaptic IPSCs, confirming they were elicited by direct cortical inhibitory transmission. Basic biophysical properties for CS-SOM-ChR2-evoked synaptic IPSCs (<i>n</i> = 16) included (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g,h,i</a>): peak, 122 \u00b1 26\u2009pA; charge, 3.85 \u00b1 0.67 pC; rise time, 1.64 \u00b1 0.13 ms; decay time, 28.87 \u00b1 2.76 ms. Biocytin-filled neurons were morphologically identified as SPNs post-hoc by the presence of dendritic spines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>, right, white arrows). Eight out of 16 neurons were recovered after patching and were processed for imaging; all eight of these neurons showed a high density of dendritic spines at 40-63X magnification. These data reveal that a large proportion of striatal SPNs receive direct inhibitory input driven by CS-SOM neurons but does not exclude the possibility that other striatal neurons also receive inhibitory input from these projections."

To address this question we used an optogenetic approach in SOM-Cre-D1/D2 transgenic mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>) in which dSPNs and iSPNs are labeled with td-Tomato and GFP, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> left and middle). In these mice, AAV.ChR2.Flex injected in the AC induces ChR2 expression in CS-SOM neurons. Although both D1-type dopamine receptors and our ChR2 virus are tagged with tdTomato, ChR2-tdTomato-positive axons were detectable in the area of our recordings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, left and right panels, white arrows). To determine the relative strength of CS-SOM connections onto the two classes of SPNs, we recorded in coronal brain slices from a dSPN and a neighboring iSPN (~100\u2009\u03bcm) in the dorsal striatum ipsilateral to the injection site. It has been reported (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ade et al., 2011</a>) that in <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato and <i>Drd2</i>-EGFP mice, fluorescent labeling is restricted to SPNs (i.e. no fluorescent labeling of the three main classes of interneurons in the striatum: parvalbumin-expressing, somatostatin-expressing, and cholinergic). However, to ensure that the neurons we recorded from were in fact SPNs, we also identified them post-hoc by the presence of dendritic spines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, right, white arrow). Six out of fourteen neurons were recovered after patching and were processed for imaging; all six of these neurons showed a high density of dendritic spines at 40-63X magnification. All recordings were performed in the presence of NBQX and CPP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, red traces); CS-SOM-ChR2-evoked synaptic IPSCs were completely blocked by application of gabazine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, black traces). The peak and charge of the maximal IPSCs were used as measures of the strength of the CS-SOM projections to dSPNs (n = 7) and iSPNs (n = 7). IPSCs peak amplitude (dSPN: 149 \u00b1 30\u2009pA; iSPN: 130 \u00b1 21\u2009pA; p\u00a0=\u00a00.7 rank-sum test) and charge (dSPN: 6.26 \u00b1 1.03 pC; iSPN: 5.24 \u00b1 1.38 pC; p\u00a0=\u00a00.3 rank-sum test) were similar in dSPNs and iSPNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). There were no differences in IPSCs rise times (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>; example IPSCs from iSPN <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>), suggesting the CS-SOM synapses had similar somatodendritic distributions on dSPNs and iSPNs.

Our results support this hypothesis and additionally conclude that both the motor and the auditory cortices send long-range GABAergic projections to the dorsal striatum, via CS-SOM neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Because of its presence in two such disparate cortical areas, this would suggest that the corticostriatal somatostatin projection connectivity pattern is likely a general feature of the corticostriatal network. We demonstrated that a class of corticostriatal long-range inhibitory neurons in the auditory and motor cortex of the mice are somatostatin-expressing neurons. Our results suggest that CS-SOM neurons provide a major GABAergic projection to the dorsal striatum, in agreement with a recent anatomical study in the mouse frontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tomioka et al., 2015</a>). However previous results from retrospinal and somatosensory cortex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jinno and Kosaka, 2004</a>) have provided anatomical evidence for expression of parvalbumin in glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways in mice suggesting that corticostriatal long-range inhibitory neurons are characterized predominantly by parvalbumin-expressing neurons. Moreover, recent results from prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2014</a>), show that corticostriatal long-range inhibitory neurons are characterized predominantly by parvalbumin-expressing or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing but not somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Overall, these suggest that corticostriatal long-range GABAergic projections may be characterized by heterogeneous subtypes of interneurons, and that additional studies are necessary to determine the subtypes and the physiological impact of long-range corticostriatal GABAergic projections on striatal neurons."

Particularly, CS-SOM neurons target SPNs and have the ability to affect their spike timing and generation. In the cortex, interneurons target the somatodendritic compartment of pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib53\">Somogyi et al., 1998</a>). SOM cortical and striatal interneurons in particular target the dendrites of pyramidal neurons and SPNs, respectively; although not specifically tuft dendrites as is characteristic of their hippocampal analogue, OLM cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Freund and Buzsaki, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</a>). This connectivity pattern may allow the dendrites to sum incoming activity over a broader window of time (synaptic integration) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</a>). We suggest that a similar inhibitory mechanism might be applied to the corticostriatal long-range inhibitory circuit, in which CS-SOM neurons, by targeting the dendrites of SPNs, play a role in the integration of incoming cortical excitatory inputs to the striatum."

Particularly, it is suggested that dSPNs promote behaviors that have previously been rewarded while iSPNs suppress behaviors that have not previously been rewarded (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gong et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ade et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Calabresi et al., 2014</a>). It is very well established that long-range glutamatergic/excitatory projections regulate the activity of dSPNs and iSPNs. However, how activity of CS-SOM neurons influences dSPNs and iSPNs has not been established. Our results show that the cortex provides an inhibitory projection to both direct and indirect pathway neurons, influencing the output of both striatal networks involved in action selection and suppression of action. The functional role of inhibition from CS-SOM neurons might be not in separating the activity of direct and indirect striatal pathways, but rather in shaping the output of both. This is reminiscent of the finding by Kress et al. (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kress et al., 2013</a>) that long-range excitatory corticostriatal connections from intratelencephalic and pyramidal tract neurons in motor cortex are made onto both dSPNs and iSPNs in the mouse dorsal striatum."

Anatomical and physiological data have suggested that once this information reaches the dorsal striatum via the corticostriatal projection, it is either channeled into parallel functional segregated circuits (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexander et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bordi and LeDoux, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bordi et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Middleton and Strick, 2000</a>) or integrated within these circuits (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nauta and Domesick, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hoffer and Alloway, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kolomiets et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Reig and Silberberg, 2014</a>). The existence of direct inhibitory cortical inputs to the dorsal striatum is likely to have profound consequences for corticostriatal mechanisms by which the AC regulates the output of the striatum and how auditory information is transformed into motor command (<a href=\"#bib65\">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</a>). It is very well established that the dorsal striatum is characterized by activity-dependent plasticity (for review, see [<a href=\"#bib29\">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</a>]). Particularly, striatal plasticity can alter the transfer of information throughout the striatum and may serve as a neuronal substrate for the transformation of sensory information and motor planning for flexible motor actions and procedural memory. Recently, Xiong et al. (<a href=\"#bib64\">Xiong et al., 2015</a>) found that auditory corticostriatal projections are involved in the learning of an auditory frequency discrimination task. They found that neurons in the dorsal striatum of the rat are selectively potentiated by auditory corticostriatal neurons to promote the learned transformation of sounds into motor actions. Moreover, Chen et al. (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2015</a>) demonstrated that motor learning is characterized by structural rearrangements of presynaptic boutons of cortical SOM interneurons. Further experiments are needed to understand the functional significance of this direct cortical inhibition to the dorsal striatum, but in combination with the two above mentioned studies it invites speculation that CS-SOM neurons might play a role in mechanisms underlying spine dynamics by inducing a specific reorganization of dendritic excitatory synapses on SPNs and have consequences on learning and/or memory retrieval."

We have shown that the dorsal striatum receives not only glutamatergic excitatory inputs from the cortex, but also inhibitory inputs. This may suggest that the timing and ratio of excitation and inhibition, two opposing forces in the mammalian cerebral cortex, can dynamically affect the output of the dorsal striatum, providing a general mechanism for motor control driven by sensory stimuli."

We recorded IPSCs from putative spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the dorsal striatum during photoactivation of the CS-SOM ChR2-positive axon terminals.

There are too many axons though and they cross over each other too much to allow an axon reconstruction from our virus injections. Of course, intracellular staining of cells in the slice does not fill axons to their terminals in the striatum. It would be very useful to stain individual CS-SOM neurons in vivo using juxtacellular labelling, but so far we have not been successful at this technically challenging experiment."

We would like to measure the proportion of the total corticostriatal projection accounted for by SOM cells, and also the size of the component arising from other GABAergic neurons. Although it has been shown that PARV-positive neurons project to the striatum (and we have seen this ourselves), we think it is critical to characterize the labelling in the PARV-Cre animal before doing the measurement. Because the pyramidal cell projection to the striatum is so large, even a tiny expression of channelrhodopsin in pyramidal cells would invalidate the measurement. We are currently working on evaluating the selectivity of the PARV Cre mouse and resolving technical problems associated with its use in this experiment."
