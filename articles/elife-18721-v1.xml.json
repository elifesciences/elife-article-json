He or she can aim to kick the ball along a number of different trajectories, and the success of the kick will depend on a range of different factors, such as small differences in the execution of the kick and, most importantly, the response of the goalkeeper. The simplest way to think about the decision that the player has to make is to say that he or she has to decide between two options: aiming for the left half of the goal or aiming for the right half (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Most studies of the neuronal mechanisms that underlie decision-making have focused on \"target selection\" situations like this, where the available options are limited in number and clearly distinct from each other (<a href=\"#bib7\">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Romo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Thura and Cisek, 2014</a>)."

In this example there are two options (indicated by the two red arrows), and each option is associated with a specific probability of success (indicated by the numbers). A region of the brain called the dorsal premotor cortex plays an important role in making target selection decisions (also known as categorical decisions), while the primary motor cortex is responsible for executing the decision. (<b>B</b>) In a target estimation situation there is an infinite number of options (six of which are indicated by red arrows), and the probability of success can be plotted as a distribution with two peaks (yellow line). (<b>C</b>) Dekleva et al. have performed experiments on monkeys to explore the roles played by the dorsal premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex in making target estimation decisions (also known as continuous decisions). In the experiments the monkeys had to select a specific direction from a range of possible directions on the basis of incomplete visual information. Dekleva et al. measured how the level of neural activity (y-axis)\u00a0in these two regions of the brain varied as a function of the angle (x-axis)\u00a0between the preferred direction of the neurons and the chosen direction; they also varied the degree of uncertainty in the visual information provided to the monkeys about the location of the target. The range of possible directions was wide (orange arrows) when the uncertainty in the visual information provided to the monkeys was high, and the range was narrow (green arrows) when the uncertainty was low. In both regions the level of neural activity was highest when the angle between the preferred direction and the chosen direction (indicated by the vertical arrow) was zero. However, high levels of neural activity were observed over a relatively wide range of angles in the dorsal premotor cortex (left inset), and this range was higher when the degree of uncertainty was higher (orange line). In the primary motor cortex, on the other hand, high levels of neural activity were only observed for a narrow range of directions around the chosen direction, independent of the degree of uncertainty in the visual information (right inset)."

Indeed, they can aim at any point in the goal. This means that the player has to decide between an infinitely large range of possible trajectories (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To do this, he or she has to estimate the probability of success for each possible trajectory and then select the one with the highest likelihood of success.

Studies of primates suggest that a region of the brain called the dorsal premotor cortex plays an important role in making target selection decisions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2005</a>), and that the primary motor cortex is responsible for executing such decisions. Now, in eLife, Lee Miller and colleagues at Northwestern University, including Brain Dekleva as first author, report the results of experiments on monkeys that shed new light on the role of these two regions in making target estimation decisions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Dekleva et al., 2016</a>). The experiments involved simultaneously recording neural activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex as the monkeys performed a target estimation task."

The monkey received a reward every time it moved the cursor to the correct target. Neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd neurons) and the primary motor cortex have a \"preferred direction\", and the Northwestern group measured the level of neural activity as a function of the angle between the preferred direction of groups of neurons and the direction selected by the monkey (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

The Northwestern group also observed relatively high levels of activity in the PMd neurons representing directions other than the selected direction when the uncertainty was high: this suggests that, during decision making, the dorsal premotor cortex represents all directions that might be correct, each weighted by its probability of success. Again this makes sense: when the degree of uncertainty is high, there is a higher likelihood that a direction other than the chosen one is correct, so the PMd neurons representing these other directions are more active. In contrast, in the primary motor cortex, only those neurons representing the chosen direction were active (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

This was taken as evidence that the dorsal premotor cortex plays a direct role in decision making. In contrast, by showing that the PMd neurons representing all possible actions are active throughout the planning and execution of a target estimation task, the results of the Northwestern team argue strongly against a direct role for the dorsal premotor cortex in decision making because it is the M1 neurons, but not the PMd neurons, that encode the chosen direction unambiguously."

However, recent work in rodents indicates that other interpretations are possible (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ogawa et al., 2013</a>), and the results of Dekleva et al. support an implicit (rather than explicit) representation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ma et al., 2006</a>)."
