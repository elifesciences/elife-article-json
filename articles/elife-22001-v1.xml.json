Synchronisation of oscillatory activity might contribute to WM by enabling the coordination of long-range processes. However, causal evidence for the way oscillatory activity shapes network dynamics and behavior in humans is limited. Here we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports WM. Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected fMRI data reveals tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state. Specifically, synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity results indicate that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network. Overall, our findings demonstrate a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization."

Synchronisation of oscillatory activity might contribute to WM by enabling the coordination of long-range processes. However, causal evidence for the way oscillatory activity shapes network dynamics and behavior in humans is limited. Here we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports WM. Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected fMRI data reveals tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state. Specifically, synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity results indicate that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network. Overall, our findings demonstrate a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization."

Many areas in the brain that are involved in these processes are located far apart, and so performing these tasks efficiently depends on the regions being able to communicate and coordinate information. Rhythmic waves of electrical activity in the brain are considered to be essential to maintain the flow of information. These brain waves occur when many brain cells repeatedly send signals at the same time, and the precise \u2018beat\u2019 of the signals might be especially important when performing more complex tasks."

This technique can be used to investigate the importance of precise timing between brain waves and its impact on performing tasks, as well as changes in brain activity that occur when tasks are more complex. For example, is a person\u2019s behaviour affected if electrical stimulation is used to make their brain waves more or less synchronized?"

When these regions were stimulated with the same \u2018beat\u2019 to make the brain waves more synchronized, the person performed better in the more difficult tasks. In these tasks, participants had to monitor number sequences, and spot repeated patterns in the remembered information. To better understand this effect Violante et al. performed brain stimulation while collecting brain scans. The scans showed that stimulation at the same \u2018beat\u2019 increases brain activity in the regions involved in task performance and changes the pattern of how regions communicate in the brain. This finding suggests that the \u2018beat\u2019 of brain waves is important for task performance, and that stimulating the brain externally can alter how regions in the brain communicate."

The right hemisphere was stimulated because increasing demand in verbal N-back conditions was associated with stronger activity and effective connectivity within the right hemisphere WM network (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fedorenko et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dima et al., 2014</a>), as well as a more pronounced effect of tACS on WM performance (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jau\u0161ovec et al., 2014</a>).

Our fMRI-tACS experimental design used short trains of tACS that avoid aftereffects of the stimulation (<a href=\"#bib77\">Vossen et al., 2015</a>) whilst maximizing power to detect changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Functional (f) MRI is well suited to this purpose because BOLD: (1) provides a measurement of brain activity during tACS without complex artifacts that can severely contaminate traditional electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cabral-Calderin et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Vosskuhl et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Noury et al., 2016</a>); and (2) is unaffected by the phase of the applied stimulation."

We found that synchronous (in-phase) stimulation caused an improvement in performance and led to increased frontoparietal activity when cognitive demands were high.

TACS applied during the CRT task resulted in greater activity in occipito-temporal regions for both synchronous and desynchronous tACS conditions. (<b>C</b>) Increased BOLD signal for synchronous compared to desynchronous tACS conditions, for tACS stimulation relative to no tACS stimulation, was observed in the left hemisphere in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). This difference in brain activity is explained by decreased activity during desynchronous compared to synchronous tACS, right plot.

The effects depend on the relative phase of the external oscillators and also the underlying cognitive state at the time tACS is applied. In particular, we showed that imposing theta frequency synchronously across the inferior parietal lobe and middle frontal gyrus improves verbal WM performance and increases frontal and parietal brain activity. The functional connectivity of the inferior parietal lobe was also modulated by tACS in a phase dependent manner. Frontal interactions increased with synchronous theta stimulation whereas posterior interactions increased with desynchronous stimulation, suggesting that information flow through brain regions involved in WM can be differentially affected by varying the phase of external stimulation. Therefore, we provide a direct demonstration of the role of phase synchronization in cognitive demanding WM processes and we showed the neural correlates associated with this process."

This leads to the prediction that stimulation is highly dependent on the underlying network dynamics (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alagapan et al., 2016</a>). Our imaging results for the 2-back and CRT tasks strongly support these notions and show how the physiological effect of external oscillatory manipulations are highly dependent on the underlying cognitive state. While synchronous and desynchronous stimulation produced distinct activity and connectivity patterns in the 2-back task, they resulted in similar changes of activity and no effects on connectivity for the CRT task. Compared to the CRT, the 2-back task is more demanding and engages the frontoparietal network more heavily, which is observed both in terms of increased BOLD activity and theta power (<a href=\"#bib56\">Payne and Kounios, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Heinzel et al., 2014</a>)"

Our observations that tACS had no effect on less demanding 1-back or CRT tasks suggests that the behavioral effects of entraining oscillations interacts with the extent that a network is already engaged by a cognitive task. Remarkably, synchronous tACS produced sufficient improvement in response times to make 2-back performance similar to the 1-back condition, which is typically associated with much faster responses."

For example, theta synchrony between frontal and parietal brain regions increases during complex manipulations of items held in WM (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sauseng et al., 2005</a>). Importantly, our neuroimaging results show the neural correlates of this effect on network efficiency. Entraining synchronous activity across the right frontoparietal network was associated with increased activity within the inferior parietal lobe and middle frontal gyrus, regions known to play a key role in WM function. Activation in these regions increases with WM demands and its damage leads to impairments of WM (<a href=\"#bib18\">Curtis and D'Esposito, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Berryhill and Olson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fedorenko et al., 2013</a>). In keeping with these findings, we show that increased activity within the right inferior parietal lobe correlated with faster responses during the 2-back, supporting a link between neural activity and the behavioral effects of tACS. This is in agreement with the critical role of this region during WM maintenance (<a href=\"#bib16\">Constantinidis and Steinmetz, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pessoa et al., 2002</a>), and the observations that disrupting its activity through transcranial magnetic stimulation affects performance in both spatial and verbal WM tasks (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kessels et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mottaghy et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Postle et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, during maintenance of items in WM the parietal cortex is positively associated with trial-by-trial performance and inter-individual differences in WM capacity (<a href=\"#bib74\">Todd and Marois, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Xu and Chun, 2006</a>). The fact that a relationship with response times was observed for the parietal but not the frontal region might be explained by the different roles attributed to parietal and frontal cortices in verbal WM. Evidence suggests that these regions have different contributions to phonological storage and executive control (<a href=\"#bib55\">Paulesu et al., 1993</a>). Moreover, our results are congruent with findings from other studies showing correlations between BOLD activity or connectivity density and response times in similar verbal WM tasks (<a href=\"#bib35\">Honey et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tomasi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Liu et al., 2017</a>).

Interestingly, the stimulant drug methylphenidate has been shown to enhance WM performance and increase parietal activity in a similar verbal N-back task (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tomasi et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that cognitive enhancement produced pharmacologically or electrically may converge on similar neural mechanisms."

During synchronous stimulation, functional connectivity increased between the IPL-electrode region and frontal parts of the frontoparietal network, that\u00a0is, DLPFC. Increased frontoparietal functional connectivity has previously been observed during WM processing (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</a>), is associated with higher accuracy and faster RTs (<a href=\"#bib61\">Prado et al., 2011</a>), and is linked to increased theta synchrony (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liebe et al., 2012</a>). Our results extend these findings by showing how externally induced theta synchrony can increase frontoparietal interactions between the parietal cortex and DLPFC that are important for WM processing. This pattern was observed when the parietal region was used as a seed, but not for the frontal region. One possible explanation for this finding is that functional connectivity between the frontal and other brain regions was already operating at peak levels in the task periods without stimulation and could not be further modulated by tACS. A more intriguing possibility is that distinct frequency channels are responsible for carrying feedforward and feedback signalling. Such a distinction has been observed in the visual cortex, where feedforward influences are carried by theta and gamma band synchronization, while feedback influences by beta band synchronization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bastos et al., 2015</a>). In this framework, it is possible that tACS applied at the theta frequency would differentially enhance feedforward connectivity across the synchronized fronto-parietal network. Studies combining tACS with electrophysiological methods could help explore this hypothesis."

The shift in parietal functional connectivity between frontal and posterior regions shows how altering phase synchrony might control long-range network interactions and so shape information flow. One interpretation of our findings is that high WM demands are normally associated with high levels of frontoparietal connectivity, and this can be enhanced by synchronous tACS applied across the network. Disrupting interactions across the network through desynchronous tACS increases parietal connections to the occipital lobe, perhaps as a result of the restoration of a \u2018default\u2019 pattern of functional connectivity normally observed in the absence of high levels of top-down cognitive control. This idea is supported by the notion that phase relations among neuronal groups could contribute to selective routing of information and shape effective connectivity, an argument supported by computational models (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akam and Kullmann, 2014</a>) and empirical evidence (<a href=\"#bib79\">Womelsdorf et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Helfrich et al., 2014</a>). Intracortical recordings show that altered phase relations between brain regions precede changes in neural activity, providing evidence that the influence of synchronizing activity across neuronal groups can be phase dependent (<a href=\"#bib79\">Womelsdorf et al., 2007</a>). Converging evidence that this can be externally modulated is provided by the observation that in- and out-of-phase tACS applied in the gamma band modulates inter-hemispheric connectivity and shapes visual perception (<a href=\"#bib33\">Helfrich et al., 2014</a>)."

First, there is unbalanced electric field distribution between the tACS conditions (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is a consequence of using a common return electrode. Thus, when current was applied synchronously to the frontal and parietal electrodes the temporal return electrode received the sum of the applied currents to each electrode, while in the desynchronous condition the current in the return electrode is cancelled by the opposing phases of the frontal and parietal electrodes. Nevertheless, although synchronous and desynchronous tACS resulted in different current distributions in the brain, our results could not have been predicted by a current density model. Modulations of brain activity and connectivity were predominantly restricted to areas involved in task performance and no effects were observed in the cortical area underneath the temporal return electrode. These results further demonstrate that the effects of brain stimulation cannot be determined without taking into account the underlying brain dynamics (<a href=\"#bib63\">Reato et al., 2013</a>) and provide additional support for the critical neural state-dependency of tACS (<a href=\"#bib24\">Feurra et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Ruhnau et al., 2016</a>). Second, the area of stimulation was relatively large and potentially affected subregions with complex functional architecture and diverse effects on WM processing. Future work will need to use high-density multi-channel stimulators to improve the focality of the cortical effect of tACS. Third, the optimal frequency and phase is likely to suffer from inter-individual variability. However, the parameter space of possible stimulation regimes is very large and it is likely that other combinations of tACS parameters (that\u00a0is, frequency, phase, intensity, etc.) will produce greater effects on cognition. The key to unlocking the potential of this technique for clinical use will be to understand the neural mechanisms governing the cognitive effects of the stimulation. Machine-learning techniques combined with real-time imaging could help select the ideal combination of parameters to induce the desired modulation of brain activity/connectivity in a subject-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lorenz et al., 2016</a>). Finally, while our fMRI approach benefited from good spatial resolution in the absence of complex electrical artifacts, we are not able to specify which brain frequencies were modulated by our intervention, as the correspondence between brain oscillations and BOLD signal is not fully understood (<a href=\"#bib70\">Scheeringa et al., 2011</a>) and tACS might induce cross-frequency coupling (<a href=\"#bib62\">Reato et al., 2010</a>)."

The majority of these studies targeted the DLPFC and recent meta-analyses have indicated small but significant effects of tDCS on WM (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brunoni and Vanderhasselt, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hill et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mancuso et al., 2016</a>). Broadly, these findings and ours show that tES is capable of modulating the neural processes associated with WM. But are tDCS and tACS acting through similar mechanisms? Although tDCS uses direct instead of an oscillatory current to modulate cortical excitability, anodal tDCS applied to the DLPFC increased oscillatory brain activity in alpha and theta frequency bands in occipito-parietal regions during a verbal WM task (<a href=\"#bib82\">Zaehle et al., 2011</a>). This indicates that the local changes in neuronal excitability induced by tDCS produced interactive effects that resulted in the modulation of oscillatory activity in distant cortical regions. Although this shows that tDCS interacts with the neural mechanisms associated with WM, future studies should carefully consider the biological processes they aim to target, as different tES modalities impact brain excitability to different degrees (<a href=\"#bib36\">Inukai et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, a recent study elegantly demonstrated that WM performance is very sensitive to the external stimulation parameters (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alekseichuk et al., 2016</a>). A study comparing different tES modalities could help answer this question. Such a study would benefit from applying a similar methodology to the one we employed, in which blocks of short durations of different tES modalities could be combined with fMRI."

Additionally, two other participants were excluded from the CRT analysis in Experiment 2, one due to unreliable reaction times (&gt;20% of the trials had RTs\u00a0&gt;\u00a01.5 SD above the mean for the subject individual RT) and another due to a technical error with the recordings of the behavioral fMRI responses. One participant was excluded from the 2-back analysis in Experiment 2 due to low accuracy (performance at chance level). Thus, for Experiment 2 our final cohort for the CRT task was composed of twenty subjects, three left-handed, seven females, age range: 20\u201335 years, mean age \u00b1 SD: 26.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.34, and twenty-one subjects, three left-handed, seven females, age range: 20\u201335 years, mean age \u00b1 SD: 27.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.56 for the 2-back task."

Stimulation was administered for the duration of the tasks, starting at the beginning of each task and finishing when the task was over, total stimulation duration was 26.5 min. During sham sessions, tACS was applied in the synchronous condition for 30 s at the beginning of each task. In Experiment 2, tACS was applied in a pseudo-randomized order for the duration of task (30s) or fixation blocks (20s), where a fixation cross was presented centrally. The application of short trains of tACS has the advantage of allowing the measurement of many periods of neural entrainment without an increase of oscillatory power due to tACS aftereffects (<a href=\"#bib77\">Vossen et al., 2015</a>). Each participant performed one fMRI run of each task and tACS condition (that\u00a0is, 2-back synchronous tACS, 2-back desynchronous tACS, CRT synchronous tACS and CRT desynchronous tACS). The order of the runs was counterbalanced across participants.

The experimental setup for Experiment 2 is represented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. In brief, the stimulators were placed outside the MR shielded room and the current from the stimulators was delivered into the scanner room after being filtered from RF noise by two filter boxes, one placed in the operator room and another inside the scanner bore, the latter was connected to the stimulation electrodes via a Y-cable. Phantom and pilot experiments were initially conducted to ensure that the experimental setup did not introduce artifacts in the fMRI signal.

Briefly, different tissue types including white matter, grey matter, CSF, skin and skull were segmented and tetrahedral volume meshes of the head were generated using the SimNibs routine. In the case of the synchronous tACS condition three electrodes were included in the model: two anodes (F4 and P4) and one cathode (T8). In the case of the desynchronous tACS condition the current in the cathode is cancelled by the opposing flow of currents in the anodes; this condition was modeled with an anode and a cathode (P4 and F4). The localization of each electrode was defined by transforming the electrode center coordinates in MNI space to the space of the individual meshes (native FreeSurfer (<a href=\"http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/\">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</a>) RAS space).

Regressors were created by convolving a boxcar kernel with a canonical double-gamma hemodynamic response function. The GLM design matrix consisted of those regressors of interest, their first temporal derivatives and six movement regressors to account for movement-related noise, plus a nuisance regressor for stimulation perception (for subjects where this was assessed). Mixed effects analyses of group effects were performed for each task separately using FLAME 1, the FMRIB local analysis of Mixed Effects (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beckmann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Woolrich et al., 2004</a>), for the regressors of interest and the contrasts \u2018task + tACS ON\u2019 vs \u2018task + tACS OFF\u2019. Because the two tACS phase conditions were delivered in separate runs a third-level two-sample paired t-test was performed for the contrasts (\u2018task + tACS ON 0\u00b0\u201d &gt; \u2018task + tACS OFF\u2019) &gt; (\u2018task + tACS ON 180\u00b0\u201d &gt; \u2018task + tACS OFF\u2019) and the inverse contrast.

We used as seed regions the masks for P4 and F4 tACS electrodes. Time-courses for the seed regions were extracted for each participant (physiological term). Separate PPI models were created for each task and each tACS stimulation condition. Regressors included: (1) all task periods (task), to explain the variance associated with the task; (2) blocks of tACS stimulation during task; (3) blocks of tACS stimulation during fixation; (4) six movement regressors to account for movement-related noise; and (5) a nuisance regressor for stimulation perception (for subjects where this was assessed). Models were created with psychological terms for tACS stimulation during task, tACS stimulation during fixation and all task periods. For each model, the physiological term and the psychological term were used to create the PPI interaction term, the remaining regressors were also included in the model. The first-level PPIs were then entered into a group-level regression analysis for each model and tested with t-contrasts 1 or \u22121 to reveal positive or negative PPI effects, respectively. Higher-level analysis were performed for the contrasts: tACS 0\u00b0 &gt; tACS OFF, tACS 180\u00b0 &gt; tACS OFF in both directions.

RTs were normally distributed (Shapiro\u2013Wilk test) for all subjects and all conditions, with the exception of one subject for the CRT task in the sham condition. Data from this subject was included in the analysis and excluding this subject did not change the results. Analyses of behavioural data were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA and missing data handled using listwise deletion. Thus, data of nineteen participants were included for the behavioural analysis of Experiment 2. Effect sizes were measured by calculating the partial eta squared (\u03b7<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>) for repeated-measures ANOVAs and Cohen\u2019s d for post hoc t-test comparisons."

Prior evidence has suggested that oscillatory activity in these brain regions occurring the theta range (4-8 Hz) is associated with working memory tasks, and that the relative phases of these oscillations impact performance in this domain. Extending prior work in this area, the investigators applied theta (6 Hz) transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)-a technology that can exogenously manipulate neuronal oscillatory activity-to right frontal and parietal regions thought to support working memory. In their first experiment, they found that stimulation enhanced working memory performance, specifically when subjects were engaged in a task in which working memory demands were high (in this case, a 2-back N-back task). In a second experiment, the investigators applied tACS in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and found that synchronous tACS applied during the working memory task increased parietal activity, which in turn correlated with enhanced performance. Moreover, the investigators found that the phase of tACS (synchronous= 00 relative phase; asynchronous= 1800 relative phase) directly influenced functional connectivity between within the presumed right frontoparietal working memory network. Reviewers were generally enthusiastic about this manuscript, and provided comments that were both constructive in nature and readily addressable."

This means that when current was applied synchronously to the frontal and parietal electrodes the temporal return electrode received the sum of the applied currents to each electrode, while in the desynchronous condition the current in the return electrode is cancelled by the opposing phases of the frontal and parietal electrodes.

Moreover, in a recent study resting state functional connectivity density in the right parietal lobule negatively correlated with RT for the 2-back task (Liuet al., Behav Brain Res 2017; 316: 66-73). Overall these findings link activity in the parietal cortex to reaction time on working memory tasks."

It is possible that the ability to influence functional connectivity by stimulation might vary depending on the baseline state of a brain region. This is likely to vary across brain regions, which would therefore influence the effects of stimulation. For example, if frontal functional connectivity was already operating at peak levels during task periods without stimulation and could not be further modulated by tACS. A more intriguing possibility is that distinct frequency channels are responsible for carrying feedforward and feedback signalling. Such a distinction has been observed in the visual cortex, where feedforward influences are carried by theta and gamma band synchronization, while feedback influences by beta band synchronization (Bastoset al., Neuron 2015; 85(2): 390-401). In this framework it is possible that tACS applied at the theta frequency would differentially enhance feedforward connectivity across the stimulated fronto-parietal network. Further work will be needed to explore this question, for example by combining tACS with electrophysiological methods such as electrocorticography."
