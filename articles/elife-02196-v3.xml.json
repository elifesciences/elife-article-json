Here we show that the Aph1b-\u03b3-secretase is selectively involved in Nrg1 intracellular signalling. We found that Aph1b-deficient mice display a decrease in excitatory synaptic markers. Electrophysiological recordings show that Aph1b is required for excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. Furthermore, gain and loss of function and genetic rescue experiments indicate that Nrg1 intracellular signalling promotes dendritic spine formation downstream of Aph1b-\u03b3-secretase in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the physiological role of Aph1b-\u03b3-secretase in brain and provides a new mechanistic perspective on the relevance of NRG1 processing in schizophrenia."

Here we show that the Aph1b-\u03b3-secretase is selectively involved in Nrg1 intracellular signalling. We found that Aph1b-deficient mice display a decrease in excitatory synaptic markers. Electrophysiological recordings show that Aph1b is required for excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. Furthermore, gain and loss of function and genetic rescue experiments indicate that Nrg1 intracellular signalling promotes dendritic spine formation downstream of Aph1b-\u03b3-secretase in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the physiological role of Aph1b-\u03b3-secretase in brain and provides a new mechanistic perspective on the relevance of NRG1 processing in schizophrenia."

Increasing evidence suggests that different risk genes interact synergistically to contribute to SZ, mainly by affecting excitatory and/or inhibitory circuitries in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harrison and Weinberger, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lisman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lewis and Sweet, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Glausier and Lewis, 2013</a>). In particular, polymorphisms in Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) have been consistently linked to schizophrenia in different populations (<a href=\"#bib33\">Stefansson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mei and Xiong, 2008</a>). The <i>NRG1</i> gene encodes more than 30 isoforms that differ in structure, expression pattern, processing and signalling modes which complicates the study of the NRG1 family (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mei and Xiong, 2008</a>). Most Ig-Nrg1 isoforms apparently function as diffusible paracrine signals. Conversely, the cysteine-rich domain-(CRD-) containing Nrg1 isoform (also known as Type III Nrg1) is membrane bound and, in addition to canonical forward signalling via ErbB4, can also signal backward via its intracellular domain (Nrg1-ICD) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bao et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mei and Xiong, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Chen et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pedrique and Fazzari, 2010</a>). Converging studies demonstrate that Nrg1/ErbB4 forward signalling controls the establishment of cortical inhibitory circuits and is implicated in the control of neuronal synchronisation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Chen et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fazzari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Rico and Marin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cahill et al., 2012</a>).

It is known that \u03b3-secretase activity is responsible for this cleavage (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bao et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dejaegere et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Chen et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pedrique and Fazzari, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Marballi et al., 2012</a>), but it remains unclear which specific \u03b3-secretase is involved. \u03b3-secretases are a family of intramembrane proteases composed of four different subunits: presenilin (PSEN), anterior pharynx homologue 1 (APH1), nicastrin (NCT), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (<a href=\"#bib12\">De Strooper, 2003</a>). In the human genome two presenilin (<i>PSEN1</i> and <i>PSEN2</i>) and two <i>APH1</i> (<i>APH1A</i> and <i>APH1B</i>) are present; thus, at least four different \u03b3-secretase complexes can be generated. One of the major challenges in the \u03b3-secretase field is to understand whether these different \u03b3-secretase complexes have different biological or pathological functions. This question is particularly relevant for understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of SZ since indirect evidence indicates that NRG1 intracellular signalling might be involved in the risk for this disease. In this regard, a Val-to-Leu mutation in the NRG1 transmembrane domain increases the risk for development of SZ (<a href=\"#bib34\">Walss-Bass et al., 2006</a>), impairs intramembrane \u03b3-secretase cleavage of Nrg1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dejaegere et al., 2008</a>) and abnormal NRG1 processing was found in schizophrenic patients (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chong et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mei and Xiong, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Marballi et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, putative loss of function variants of APH1B, a crucial component of the \u03b3-secretase complex, were found to aggregate with <i>NRG1</i> risk alleles in schizophrenia patients (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hatzimanolis et al., 2013</a>) and Aph1b-loss of function mutations in rodents display behavioural phenotypes that are relevant for schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coolen et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dejaegere et al., 2008</a>)."

We also conditionally targeted the <i>Aph1a</i> locus, referred to as <i>Aph1a</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup>. We have found that Aph1a-\u03b3-secretase complexes are necessary to activate Notch signalling and genetic deletion of Aph1a leads to a Notch related embryonic lethality (<a href=\"#bib30\">Serneels et al., 2005</a>). Conversely, deletion of the Aph1bc-\u03b3-secretase complex does not affect Notch signalling but hampers Nrg1 processing and alters sensory motor gating, working memory and sensitivity to psychotropic drugs, thereby mimicking Nrg1 deficiency and various phenotypes related to schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coolen et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dejaegere et al., 2008</a>).

We show here that the Aph1bc-\u03b3-secretase complex controls excitatory circuitry via Nrg1 intracellular signalling. Mice mutant for <i>Aph1bc</i> display altered expression of excitatory synaptic markers, impaired synaptic transmission and decreased long term potentiation. Furthermore, single cell deletion of <i>Aph1bc</i> in vivo impaired dendritic spine formation which could be rescued by the expression of the Nrg1-ICD. Taken together, these data indicate that Nrg1 intracellular signalling downstream of Aph1bc-\u03b3-secretase complexes promotes in a cell autonomous fashion the formation of excitatory connections in cortical neurons. Hence, our study provides a cellular and molecular mechanistic explanation for the cognitive deficits observed in Aph1bc-\u03b3-secretase deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dejaegere et al., 2008</a>). More importantly, it provides unique insight into the importance of Nrg1 intracellular signalling in the establishment of functional synapses and the potential aetiological role of misprocessing of NRG1 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."

In particular, excitatory circuitry is impaired in prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lewis and Sweet, 2009</a>). Thus, we scrutinized the expression of different pre- and post-synaptic markers in control and <i>Aph1bc</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> prefrontal cortices to test if neuronal connectivity was properly established. Western blot data indicate a small but significant decrease in the expression of the presynaptic markers VGluT1 and Synaptophysin and of the postsynaptic protein PSD95 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). In addition, we carried out confocal quantitative analysis of the expression of VGluT1 and the postsynaptic marker Homer1. We found that the staining intensity of VGluT1 and Homer1 positive puncta shifted toward lower staining intensities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013H</a>). On the other hand, Aph1bc loss of function did not affect the intensity of positive puncta for VGAT, that labels all inhibitory terminals, and for PV, a specific marker for fast spiking interneurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>).

We showed that Aph1bc is expressed in CA1 and CA3 layers of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib31\">Serneels et al., 2009</a>). As it was previously reported that deletion of Presenilins in hippocampal pyramidal neurons impairs synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Saura et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>), we decided to analyse the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus, in <i>Aph1bc</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice. The Input-Output (I/O) curves, that show the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in response to stimuli of increasing strength, indicate that baseline synaptic transmission is impaired in <i>Aph1bc</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> heterozygous and <i>Aph1bc</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> homozygous mutant mice as compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Conversely, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), a presynaptic form of short term plasticity which reflects release probability, was undistinguishable in control and mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Next, we studied the relevance of Aph1bc in long-term synaptic plasticity. Induction of long term potentiation (LTP) by three trains of theta burst stimulation is impaired in both heterozygous and homozygous Aph1bc deficient mice compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Even though reduced basal transmission might in principle interfere with LTP analysis, these results suggest that synaptic plasticity is affected by Aph1bc deletion. Furthermore, we recorded miniature excitatory currents (mEPSCs) which showed normal amplitude but slightly increased inter-event intervals (IEIs) in <i>Aph1bc</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> as compared to control mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>). Since PPF analysis indicates that Aph1bc deletion does not alter release probability, the increased IEIs in mEPSCs suggest a decrease in the number of release sites that is consistent with the decreased expression of excitatory synaptic markers assessed by immunofluorescence. Altogether, Aph1bc is required for synaptic transmission and long-term synaptic plasticity."

Hence, we investigated the involvement of Aph1a in dendritic spine development in two additional experimental paradigms. First, we analysed hippocampal cultures from <i>Aph1a</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> conditional mutant mice. Aph1a deletion by GFP-<i>ires</i>-Cre expression did not alter spine formation as compared to control neurons expressing GFP, suggesting that Aph1a has a redundant function in spine formation in vitro when Aph1bc is present (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We then established primary neuronal cultures from <i>Aph1abc</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> triple conditional mutant mice to obtain complete genetic abrogation of \u03b3-secretase activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Serneels et al., 2009</a>). Deletion of all of the <i>Aph1</i> genes by GFP-<i>ires</i>-Cre expression at DIV8 decreased spine density at DIV15 similarly to Aph1bc deletion. Moreover, expression of CRD-Nrg1-FL did not rescue decreased spine density in <i>Aph1abc</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> triple mutant neurons, indicating that CRD-Nrg1-FL cleavage by the \u03b3-secretase is necessary to rescue spine formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Taken together with the conditional Aph1bc loss of function experiments, these data provide a proof of concept that specific \u03b3-secretase complexes are differentially involved in spine formation.

It should be kept in mind that both \u03b3-secretase complexes and Nrg1 isoforms impinge on multiple signalling molecules that control many facets of neuronal development and function. As several putative \u03b3-secretase substrates have been identified it is still possible that some of them may also contribute to the behavioural deficits of <i>Aph1bc</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dejaegere et al., 2008</a>). Nonetheless, we have previously shown that deletion of Aph1bc does not affect the processing of other major \u03b3-secretase substrates such as Notch and ErbB4 in vivo (<a href=\"#bib30\">Serneels et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dejaegere et al., 2008</a>). In addition, mutations of other \u03b3-secretase substrates such as APP or N-Cadherin have not been previously shown to cause schizophrenia-like behavioural deficits in mice or to be associated with schizophrenia. Hence, the biochemical and cell biological evidences from the current work, and the available genetic evidence are consistent with the conclusion that Nrg1 is the major physiological target of Aph1bc-\u03b3-secretase in vivo in the context of synapse formation. The pathological relevance of human <i>APH1B</i> and <i>NRG1</i> genetic interaction and of NRG1 processing is further supported by recent studies in Schizophrenic patients linking polymorphisms in these genes to the disease (<a href=\"#bib24\">Marballi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hatzimanolis et al., 2013</a>)."

Our in vivo experiments using Aph1bc-\u03b3-secretase deficient brains do not demonstrate neuronal loss or impaired dendritic arborisation, similar to the observations in Nrg1 transmembrane domain mutant heterozygous mice (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). We speculate that these differences may be explained by differential effects of long term abrogation of Nrg1 intracellular signalling in Nrg1 constitutive null mice which is not the case in <i>Aph1bc</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> conditional mice. On the other hand, our results show that Aph1bc-dependent Nrg1 intracellular signalling promotes dendritic spine formation. Consistent with these findings, schizophrenia-like deficits and impaired maturation of glutamatergic synapses have also been described for mice deficient in Nrg1, ErbB4 and BACE1, a protease that initiates Nrg1 processing by cleaving its extracellular domain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barros et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Del Pino et al., 2013</a>). Although these deficits were attributed to loss of ErbB4 activation in pyramidal neurons, this interpretation was challenged by the recent discovery that ErbB4 is almost exclusively expressed by cortical interneurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fazzari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wen et al., 2010</a>). More recently, it was proposed that altered glutamatergic wiring could be the result of a homeostatic response to alterations in ErbB4 expressing fast-spiking interneurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Del Pino et al., 2013</a>). Here we propose a complementary, but not mutually exclusive, mechanistic model whereby dendritic spine maturation could directly, in a cell-autonomous manner, be promoted by Aph1bc-dependent Nrg1 intracellular signalling. Notably, it has been suggested that Nrg1 could be involved in activity-dependent regulation of the structural plasticity of glutamatergic circuits since neuronal activity enhances both Nrg1 expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eilam et al., 1998</a>) and proteolytic processing by \u03b3-secretase (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bao et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ozaki et al., 2004</a>).

Antibodies: mouse anti-NeuN (MAB377; 1:500; Chemicon-Millipore); rabbit anti-CDP (Cux1) (sc-13024; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-VGluT1 (MAB5502; 1:200 in IF; Chemicon); rabbit anti-Homer1 (160003; 1:500; synaptic systems); rabbit anti-VGAT (131003; 1:500; synaptic systems); mouse anti-Parvalbumin (235; 1:500; Swant) chicken anti-GFP (GFP-1020; 1:1000; Aves). All secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae dyes (Life technologies). Conventional imaging was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan2 upright microscope with 20x Plan-Apochromat (NA = 0.5) and 100x Plan-Apochromat oil immersion (NA = 1.4) objectives. For confocal imaging we used Olympus FV1000 IX2 Inverted Confocal microscope with 60x UPlanSapo (NA = 1.35) oil immersion objective. For image analyses all pictures were processed and quantified with ImageJ software. For neuronal distribution, cortices were divided in 10 bins and NeuN fluorescence intensities in each bin were normalized for the total NeuN intensity. For VGluT1, Homer1, VGAT and PV puncta quantification confocal pictures (18 confocal planes out of three animals per condition) were taken 5 \u03bcm beneath tissue surface as described (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fazzari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Iijima et al., 2011</a>). Images received automatically thresholds with ImageJ algorithm (Yen for VGluT1 and Homer1; Intermodes for VGAT and PV) and resulting masks were redirected to the original image for automatic quantification of puncta intensity. For PV puncta we also applied a circularity filter 0.5\u20131.00 and a high size cut-off filter of 1.5 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> as previously described (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fazzari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Del Pino et al., 2013</a>). For spine quantification in neuronal cultures we took image stacks of transfected neurons (z = 0.5 \u03bcm) and we counted spines in dendritic segments at 90 to 100 \u00b5m from the soma. Morphology of Golgi stained neurons was reconstructed with ImageJ Simple neurite tracer. Spine quantification was carried out in image stacks (z = 0.5 \u03bcm) in apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons at 100 \u03bcm from pyramidal layer. In electroporated mice, we selected neurons from layer II/III and we quantified spine density in confocal stacks of basal dendrites starting from 5 \u00b5m away from the first branching point. All statistics were performed with Graph Pad Prism software."

After 90 min incubation, tungsten stimulating electrodes and glass recording electrodes were placed into the stratum radiatum of hippocampal area-CA1 to evoke field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSP). To assess basic properties of synaptic responses, I/O curves were established by stimulation with 30\u201390 \u00b5A constant currents (pulse width 0.1 ms). The stimulation strength was adjusted to evoke a fEPSP-slope of 35% of the maximum and kept constant throughout the experiment. Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) was examined by applying two pulses in rapid succession (interpulse intervals of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 ms, respectively) at 120 s intervals. 60 min thereafter, baseline recordings were started consisting of three single stimuli with 0.1 ms pulse width repeated at a 10-s interval and averaged every 5 min. LTP was induced by three TBS episodes separated by 10 min, with evoked responses monitored at 1, 4 and 7 min between TBS episodes. 10 min after the last TBS episode, evoked responses were recorded every 5 min during 4 hr.

Work was done both with constitutive Aph1BC knock-out mice, as well as in vitro using conditional single cell deletion. A very novel and interesting part of the work was the in utero electroporation to obtain single cell conditional deletion of Aph1BC, and thereby investigate the effects of abrogation under physiological conditions in a wild-type background. This manuscript also mainly uses mouse genetic approaches and many types of rescue experiments, and thus the data are largely convincing. Lastly, given the increasing demand for molecular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia, these findings may help us better understand the etiology of schizophrenia."

We observed an increase in mEPSCs inter-event intervals in Aph1BC KO mice as compared to Control mice while mEPSCs amplitude was not affected by Aph1BC deletion. These results indicate a decrease in the number of glutamate release sites that is consistent with the reduction in VGluT1 and Homer1 immunoreactivity and with the reduced spine density that we observed. In addition, we also performed recordings of mEPSCs in neuronal cultures to further corroborate the cell autonomous role of Aph1BC-gamma-secretase/Nrg1 intracellular signalling in excitatory transmission. We found that inter-event intervals and amplitude of mEPSCs are impaired by Aph1BC deletion and rescued, although not completely, by expression of Nrg1-ICD in Aph1BC deficient neurons. The experimental approach of mEPSCs recording does not allow discriminating between perisomatic, shaft, and dendritic excitatory connections, and we feel it would be too far-fetched to speculate on the reasons for this incomplete rescue. Nevertheless, these results are in line with the morphological assessment and further support the role for Aph1BC-gamma-secretase/Nrg1 intracellular signalling in excitatory synaptic function."
