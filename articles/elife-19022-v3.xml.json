Rubber transferase (RTase), the enzyme responsible for NR biosynthesis, is believed to be a member of the <i>cis</i>-prenyltransferase (cPT) family. However, none of the recombinant cPTs have shown RTase activity independently. We show that HRT1, a cPT from <i>Heveabrasiliensis</i>, exhibits distinct RTase activity in vitro only when it is introduced on detergent-washed <i>Hevea</i>RPs (WRPs) by a cell-free translation-coupled system. Using this system, a heterologous cPT from <i>Lactucasativa</i> also exhibited RTase activity, indicating proper introduction of cPT on RP is the key to reconstitute active RTase. RP proteomics and interaction network analyses revealed the formation of the protein complex consisting of HRT1, rubber elongation factor (REF) and HRT1-REF BRIDGING PROTEIN. The RTase activity enhancement observed for the complex assembled on WRPs indicates the HRT1-containing complex functions as the NR biosynthetic machinery."

Rubber transferase (RTase), the enzyme responsible for NR biosynthesis, is believed to be a member of the <i>cis</i>-prenyltransferase (cPT) family. However, none of the recombinant cPTs have shown RTase activity independently. We show that HRT1, a cPT from <i>Heveabrasiliensis</i>, exhibits distinct RTase activity in vitro only when it is introduced on detergent-washed <i>Hevea</i>RPs (WRPs) by a cell-free translation-coupled system. Using this system, a heterologous cPT from <i>Lactucasativa</i> also exhibited RTase activity, indicating proper introduction of cPT on RP is the key to reconstitute active RTase. RP proteomics and interaction network analyses revealed the formation of the protein complex consisting of HRT1, rubber elongation factor (REF) and HRT1-REF BRIDGING PROTEIN. The RTase activity enhancement observed for the complex assembled on WRPs indicates the HRT1-containing complex functions as the NR biosynthetic machinery."

In the 1960s, the enzyme responsible for NR biosynthesis from RPs was reported to be rubber transferase (RTase) [EC.2.5.1.20] (<a href=\"#bib4\">Archer, 1969</a>), although its proteinaceous components and catalytic mechanism were not elucidated. The backbone structure of NR comprises of a <i>cis</i>-1,4-polyisoprene with two or three <i>trans</i>-isoprene units at the \u03c9-terminus (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tanaka et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Eng et al., 1994</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Generally, the basic backbone structures of <i>cis,trans</i>-mixed polyisoprenoid alcohols, polyprenols and dolichols (C<sub>30</sub>\u2013C<sub>120</sub>), are biosynthesized via sequential <i>cis</i>-condensation of the C<sub>5</sub> isoprene unit, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), onto all-<i>trans</i> short-chain prenyl diphosphates such as geranyl diphosphate (GPP, C<sub>10</sub>) <i>E,E</i>-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP, C<sub>15</sub>), and <i>E,E,E</i>-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, C<sub>20</sub>).

NgBR from humans, originally identified as a receptor for the N-terminal portion of reticulon 4B/Nogo-B (<a href=\"#bib33\">Miao et al., 2006</a>), contains three predicted transmembrane domains in its N-terminal region, and a domain exhibiting low similarity to cPT in the C-terminal half, although it does not have catalytic residues conserved among cPTs. In the cPT-like domain, NgBR can also interact with a human cPT HDS/hCIT (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shridas et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Endo et al., 2003</a>) to stabilize it on the ER membrane, resulting in cPT activity enhancement (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>). Knock-down (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>) or a mutation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eng et al., 1994</a>) of <i>NgBR</i> causes defects in protein <i>N</i>-glycosylation as a consequence of a reduction in the level of dolichyl phosphates and dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, indicating that NgBR is an HDS-interacting protein and this interaction is critical for its activity. <i>NUS1</i>, a yeast homolog of NgBR, is implicated to have an important role in <i>N</i>-glycosylation and cPT activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Park et al., 2014</a>). It has also been reported that a defect in <i>LEW1</i>, a counterpart of NgBR in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, results in reduced levels of dolichol contents and protein glycosylation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Despite its importance in the eukaryotic <i>cis,trans</i>-mixed polyisoprenoid biosynthesis, a precise role of NgBR in cPT activity is still unknown owing to a lack of in vitro studies on the function of NgBR family with purified proteins. Moreover, its role as an essential subunit of a deduced cPT-containing protein complex is controversial as various eukaryotic cPTs heterologously expressed in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> have shown distinct activity without co-expression of their partner NgBR family protein (<a href=\"#bib5\">Asawatreratanakul et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Takahashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schmidt et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shridas et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Endo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cunillera et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akhtar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kera et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Surmacz et al., 2014</a>)."

This enabled de\u00a0novo synthesis of NR in vitro by the recombinant protein, providing the first direct evidence that HRT1 is an RTase in <i>H. brasiliensis.</i> In this system, a heterologous cPT from another rubber-producing plant, introduced on <i>Hevea</i> RPs, also exhibited RTase activity comparable to that of HRT1, indicating that accurate introduction of cPT on the WRPs is key to the functional expression of RTase. Reconstitution assays of HRT1 and the partner proteins on WRPs illustrated that the formation of an HRT1-containing ternary complex is important for efficient rubber production via NR biosynthesis from RPs."

Before the proteomic analyses, proteins unnecessary for RTase activity were removed from RPs by washing with CHAPS as it was the best detergent for removing protein from the RPs and had a relatively low inhibitory effect on the RTase activity among the 15 detergents tested (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Stepwise washing with buffers containing CHAPS resulted in washing-out a lot of the RP proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), whereas 80% of the RTase activity was retained on the detergent-washed RPs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Proteome analyses were conducted after removal of the protein bands corresponding to the well-studied RP-abundant hydrophobic proteins, REF (14.6\u2009kDa) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dennis and Light, 1989</a>) and small rubber particle protein (SRPP, 24\u2009kDa) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oh et al., 1999</a>), to detect low-abundance proteins. Peptides corresponding to HRT1 or HRT2 were identified among 137 proteins (115 subfamilies) assigned (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>,<a href=\"#SD2-data\">2</a>); however, this result does not allow to discriminate between these two cPTs since some detected fragments correspond to the sequences shared by both enzymes. No other prenyltransferase or enzyme in the IPP biosynthetic pathways was detected from the proteome analyses of the detergent-washed RPs, in contrast with previous proteome analyses of non-detergent-washed RPs from <i>H. brasiliensis</i>, in which several homologues of cPT (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dai et al., 2013</a>) and a homologue of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (<a href=\"#bib62\">Xiang et al., 2012</a>), one of late-limiting enzyme in the IPP biosynthetic pathway, were detected. However, we also identified a protein assigned as a homologous protein of NgBR (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>). The NgBR homologue from <i>H. brasiliensis</i> showed greater similarity to higher plant orthologues (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) that have one predicted transmembrane domain in the N-terminal region (<a href=\"#bib45\">Qu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brasher et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In parallel with the RP proteomics, we isolated the <i>Hevea</i> homologue of NgBR by screening REF-interacting proteins against normalized latex cDNA libraries using a split-ubiquitin-based yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system (see below). Several studies have suggested that REF may be involved in NR biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berthelot et al., 2014a</a>), although its precise function is unclear. Quantitative analyses of the transcript levels in various tissues showed predominant expression of the NgBR homologue in latex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), along with cPTs (<i>HRT1</i> and <i>HRT2</i>) and <i>REF</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2014a</a>), and the transcript level of the NgBR homologue in latex was comparable to those of <i>HRT1</i> and <i>HRT2</i>, but 540-fold lower than that of <i>REF</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2014a</a>). These results suggested that the NgBR homologue might possibly form a complex with HRT1/HRT2 and REF on RPs."

The assays showed that the NgBR homologue could interact with HRT1 and REF, but not with HRT2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We therefore named the NgBR homologue HRT1-REF bridging\u00a0protein (HRBP). The Y2H analyses also indicated distinct REF\u2013REF, HRBP\u2013HRBP and REF\u2013SRPP interactions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Neither homodimeric nor heterodimeric interactions for HRT1 and HRT2 were detected (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), in contrast with bacterial cPTs which function as homodimers (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fujihashi et al., 2001</a>). A bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay with split mVenus protein fragments in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf epidermal cells revealed that these interaction partnerships were also detected <i>in planta</i>, almost independent of orientations of the mVenus fragments fused in-frame with target proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig4s2\">2</a>). The subcellular localizations for each BiFC signal differed among the interaction pairs. BiFC signals indicating an HRT1\u2013HRBP interaction were observed at the Golgi, harboring or surrounding fluorescence signals for a mTurquoise2 (mTq2)-fused marker protein (XT-Golgi-mTq2), which accumulates exclusively in a medial subset of the cisternae of Golgi stacks (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pagny et al., 2003</a>). HRBP\u2013REF interactions were observed on aggregates of spherical bodies and smaller independent particles, and did not overlap with the Golgi signals, and REF\u2013REF interactions were localized mainly on oval bodies and smaller spherical particles. HRBP\u2013HRBP interactions were only observed at the perimeters of spherical particles. In contrast to the result obtained by the Y2H assay, distinct fluorescent signals indicating an HRT2\u2013HRBP interaction were observed at the plasma membrane in the BiFC assay."

                                "text": "To get information about the detailed subcellular localizations of HRT1, HRT2, HRBP and REF, these proteins fused in-frame with mTq2 or mVenus were expressed in <i>N. benthamiana</i> leaf epidermal cells. The fluorescence signals for mTq2-fused HRBP or REF showed network-like patterns, which almost overlapped with an mCherry (mChe)-HDEL ER marker (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nelson et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), indicating that these proteins were predominantly localized at the ER. HRBP:mTq2-derived signals were also observed as small dots, which did not overlap with signals for an mChe-fused Golgi marker, N-terminal 49 amino acids of GmManI (<a href=\"#bib48\">Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We could not detect distinct fluorescence signals for HRT1:mTq2 or HRT2:mTq2 when they were co-expressed with mVenus as an introduction marker. However, when HRT1:mTq2 was co-expressed with HRBP:mVenus, high HRT1:mTq2 fluorescence signals were detected at the Golgi, with weaker signals at the ER. Additionally, co-expression of HRT1:mTq2 changed the subcellular localization of fluorescent signals for HRBP:mVenus from the ER to the Golgi, which perfectly overlapped with those of the Golgi-localized HRT1:mTq2. These results indicate that HRT1 is stabilized in <i>N. benthamiana</i> cells by complex formation with the HRBP, which induces translocation of HRBP from the ER to the Golgi. In the co-expression system of HRT2:mTq2 and HRBP:mVenus, HRT2:mTq2-derived signals localized at the plasma membrane, showing a partial overlap with a marker protein mChe-AtPIP2A localized at the ER to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nelson et al., 2007</a>). These results indicate that HRT2 is also stabilized by HRBP in <i>N. benthamiana</i> cells. Surprisingly, in this co-expression system, subcellular localization of HRBP:mVenus was clearly altered from the ER to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), concordant with the BiFC signals for the HRT2\u2013HRBP interaction at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Taken together with the basic subcellular localization of HRBP on the ER, HRBP is assumed to assist incorporation or stabilization of HRT2 on the ER membrane and to be co-translocated to the plasma membrane with HRT2. Additionally, the different subcellular localization of HRT1 and HRT2 co-expressed with HRBP indicates that they have different roles. Considering that RPs are speculated to originate from the ER or Golgi apparatus (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chrispeels and Herman, 2000</a>), HRT1 may be more important in NR biosynthesis than HRT2. By contrast, the subcellular localizations of REF and HRBP were not influenced by co-expression (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although the fluorescence patterns of REF:mTq2 and HRBP:mVenus matched almost completely, formation of the REF\u2013HRBP complex is considered to be limited to specific particles, possibly derived from the ER (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The formation of homomeric complexes of REF and HRBP only on small bodies and/or particles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) suggests that physical interactions among HRT1, HRBP and REF might correlate with the protein topology on the membrane of specified compartments derived from the ER or the Golgi."

When REF:mCherry was co-expressed, BiFC signals for the HRT1-HRBP interaction were not observed at the Golgi, but overlapped with the network-like REF:mCherry signals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating REF-oriented translocation of the HRT1-HRBP complex to the ER. As expected from the Y2H assay results (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we could not detect a distinct BiFC signal indicating an HRT1-REF interaction, but could observe weak BiFC signals on aggregates of spherical bodies and smaller independent particles when HRBP without fluorescent tag was co-introduced (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting an HRBP-mediated interaction between HRT1 and REF. Co-expression of three proteins, HRT1:mTq2, HRBP:mVenus and REF:mCherry, revealed that the fluorescent signals for each protein were almost overlapped, showing network-like patterns (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), contrasting with the fluorescent signals on the Golgi and small spherical bodies in the cells co-expressing HRT1:mTq2 and HRBP:mVenus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). On the other hands, the plasma membrane localizations of HRT2:mTq2 and HRBP:mVenus were not influenced by the co-expression of REF:mCherry localized at the ER (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Most of the expressed HRT1 was incorporated into liposomes regardless of the co-existence of HRBP and REF (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, no RTase activity was detected from any proteoliposomes (data not shown). Therefore, we developed a method for cell-free translation-coupled protein introduction onto RPs to investigate the importance of the target membrane architecture and/or supplemental protein factors. To prepare RPs with minimal endogenous proteins, 50kRPs were washed with 8\u2009mM CHAPS for 1\u2009hr (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), which was optimized to suppress irreversible coagulation of the resulting detergent-washed RPs (WRPs) during the cell-free translation reaction, probably caused by a loss of membrane-bound proteins important for RP stability. Washing in this condition resulted in removal of a lot of RP proteins, including REF and SRPP (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), whereas 89% of the RTase activity was retained on the WRPs (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). After the cell-free translation reaction with WRPs, the WRP with exogenously expressed proteins can be easily separated by ultracentrifugation into the top layer (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Localizations of the exogenously expressed proteins on WRP were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and Western blot (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Similar to the case of proteoliposomes, most expressed proteins tested were incorporated into WRPs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). When these target proteins were expressed alone, some HRT1 proteins existed in the soluble fraction, whereas HRBP and REF were incorporated almost completely into WRP. However, the amount of HRT1 not incorporated on WRPs was decreased by co-expression of HRBP and REF, indicating that these proteins promotes the incorporation of HRT1 into WRPs, but are not necessary for anchoring HRT1 on WRPs. In this system, the WRP stability was influenced by introduction of exogenously expressed proteins. Detergent washing induced RP coagulation and increased the apparent average diameter; the average diameter of RPs before the detergent treatment was 222 nm whereas that of WRPs was 1244 nm (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This effect was escalated by the in vitro expression of HRBP, HRT1 and a His-tag-containing peptide from the control vector. Interestingly, however, REF expression resulted in decreased WRP coagulation, lowering the apparent average diameter towards that of the non-detergent-washed RPs, indicating that REF stabilizes WRP by preventing aggregation. This effect was dominant for the coagulation-inducible proteins, HRBP and HRT1; coagulation of WRPs was inhibited when three proteins, HRT1, HRBP and REF, were co-expressed."

The HRT1-derived RTase activity was enhanced by co-expression of HRBP and was markedly activated by additional introduction of REF. <sup>14</sup>C-IPP incorporation in the assays of WRPs carrying three proteins was increasing linearly during 20\u2009hr of the reaction time, whereas for WRPs carrying HRT1 only or two proteins, HRT1 and HRBP, the incorporation was weakened after 8\u2009hr, suggesting that co-expression of REF and HRBP stabilized HRT1 on WRPs. The RTase activity of WRPs carrying three proteins depended on the HRT1 and HRBP protein levels, and the activity reached a plateau when the HRT1 and HRBP levels were apparently equivalent (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The RTase activity of the triple components showed a strict allylic substrate dependency; the RTase was most active with FPP (C<sub>15</sub>) while the activity was low in the absence of an allylic substrate (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Other allylic substrates showed comparable activities when the triple components were used for the reactions (e.g., GPP and GGPP showed 83% and 93% activities, respectively), and the patterns of allylic substrate dependency were quite similar to those of the control reactions using WRPs expressing REF only (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>) and WRPs alone as reported elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rojruthai et al., 2010</a>). Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) of the <sup>14</sup>C-IPP-derived reaction products revealed that the size distributions of polyisoprenoids synthesized in vitro with WRPs carrying HRT1 were similar to those with control WRPs, showing unimodal size distributions with a peak at &gt;10<sup>6</sup> as endogenous NR in WRPs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>), concordant with previous reports for small rubber particles (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rojruthai et al., 2010</a>)\u00a0that corresponds to the 50kRP in this study. The size distributions of the HRT1-derived polyisoprenoids were not influenced by co-expression of HRBP and REF, suggesting that complex formation on the WRPs does not affect the product chain-length regulation mechanism of HRT1. These results, together with the allylic primer requirement for the RTase reaction (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>), suggest a possibility that HRT1 on WRP catalyzes a de\u00a0novo rubber formation using allylic primer substrates, GPP, FPP and GGPP, rather than addition of IPP onto the \u03b1-terminus of pre-existing rubber molecules in WRPs, which is concordant with the backbone structure of NR, a <i>cis</i>-1,4-polyisoprene with several <i>trans</i>-isoprene units at the \u03c9-terminus (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tanaka et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Eng et al., 1994</a>)."

However, practical, functional identification of RTase was not accomplished to date, owing to the absence of in vitro RTase activity distinctly exhibited by recombinant cPTs. In a previous study to elucidate activation mechanism of cPT as RTase, we showed that the refolded HRT2, which was heterologously expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and purified from its insoluble membrane fraction under denaturing conditions, was significantly activated by the addition of washed-bottom fraction (BF) of <i>H. brasiliensis</i> latex. This resulted in the formation of polyisoprenes with similar molecular size distributions as that of the NR in <i>Hevea</i> latex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Asawatreratanakul et al., 2003</a>). Whereas the refolded recombinant HRT1 was not activated. BF is the sediment fraction separated by ultracentrifugation of latex and consists mainly of membrane-bound polydisperse particles called lutoids and contaminated RPs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moir, 1959</a>), with lower RTase activity compared to that of RPs (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tangpakdee et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wititsuwannakul et al., 2003</a>). Therefore, it was suggested that HRT2 might function as a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of natural rubber, correlating with essential co-factor(s) included in the washed-BF. Likewise, eukaryotic long-chain cPTs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Takahashi and Koyama, 2006</a>), responsible for formation of dolichols and/or long-chain (C<sub>&gt;70</sub>) polyprenols, such as Rer2p and Srt1p from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sato et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sato et al., 2001</a>), DPS from <i>A. thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cunillera et al., 2000</a>), and HDS from humans (<a href=\"#bib17\">Endo et al., 2003</a>), do not exhibit cPT activity in vitro when expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. These eukaryotic cPTs were functionally identified by an in vitro assay with crude membrane or microsomal proteins from an yeast mutant strain of <i>RER2</i> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sato et al., 1999</a>), expressing a heterologous cPT. This can be described as an almost solo authorised approach for the functional identification to date. In this yeast system, both HRT2 and HRT1 show distinct cPT activity, producing polyisoprenoids with chain-lengths ranging from C<sub>80</sub> to C<sub>100</sub> as general eukaryotic long-chain cPTs. However, their catalytic properties have never been successfully modified into RTase by the addition of any latex fractions (<a href=\"#bib57\">Takahashi et al., 2012</a>). These facts suggest that both, HRT1 and HRT2 may require additional factor(s) present within the eukaryotic cell to exhibit cPT activity and other latex-specific factor(s) to exhibit RTase activity. Additionally, HRT1/HRT2 incorporated into the yeast microsome or membrane fraction may be established as a long-chain cPT even in the presence of latex-derived factor(s). Eukaryotic post-translational modifications such as glycosylations in the ER were considered to be potential candidates for a key activation factor of eukaryotic cPTs generally localised to the ER (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shridas et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sato et al., 2001</a>). However, this is unlikely since in this study, recombinant HRT1 and LsCPT3 showed distinct RTase activity in vitro (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figures 9</a> and <a href=\"#fig10\">10</a>) when they were introduced on RPs by means of the wheat germ cell-free system, in which no post-translational modifications occur without supplementation of donor substrates and cofactors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harbers, 2014</a>)."

Recently, NgBR homologs on RPs were identified from other NR producing plants, lettuce, and Russian dandelion, using an RP proteomics approach, although no cPT homolog was detected in these proteomics analyses (<a href=\"#bib45\">Qu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Janina, 2015</a>). These NgBR homologs were shown to interact with cPT(s) exclusively expressed in latex. A knockdown of these NgBR homologs results in significant decrease of rubber content, suggesting involvement of the NgBR homologs in the NR biosynthesis of these NR-producing plants. These observations correlate with former reports (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Park et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yu et al., 2006</a>), in which knockdown or mutation of the NgBR family proteins from humans and <i>A. thaliana</i> resulted in severe <i>N</i>-glycosylation defects, owing to decrease in contents of dolichyl phosphates, <i>cis,trans</i>-mixed polyisoprenoids formed by the action of long-chain cPTs. While cPT is encoded by one or two genes in yeasts and animals, in higher plats it is generally encoded by a multigene family, resulting in generation of the short-, middle-, and long-chain cPTs. Short- or middle-chain cPTs from <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, heterologously expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, exhibit a distinct cPT activity independently in vitro, producing polyisoprenoids shorter than C<sub>60</sub> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akhtar et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, the recombinant protein of a <i>cis,trans</i>-mixed heptaprenyl diphosphate (C<sub>35</sub>) synthase from <i>A. thalina</i>, also exhibits a cPT activity independently without corresponding NgBR family protein (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kera et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Surmacz et al., 2014</a>). Taken together, the NgBR family protein is considered to be a subunit protein of a long-chain cPT on the ER, responsible for the dolichol or NR formations, resulting in enhancement of cPT activity. However, it is unclear whether involvement of the NgBR family protein is a stringent requirement for cPT activation since various eukaryotic long-chain cPTs, including HRT1 and HRT2, expressed in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> show distinct activity without co-expression of a partner NgBR family protein. In vitro results in the present study emphasize that an NgBR family protein is not necessary for the catalytic activity of cPT to produce polyisoprenoids that correspond to NR; HRT1 and LsCPT3 showed a significant rubber-producing activity when introduced into WRPs (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figures 9</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">10</a>). Due to low amino acid sequence identities between HRT1/HRT2, and LsCPT3 and between HRBP and LsCPTL2 (53% and 45%, respectively), it is unlikely that the small amount of HRBP retained on RPs after the detergent wash could have interacted with LsCPT3 as a surrogate partner for its activation. In practice, we have analysed cross-species interaction partnerships between cPT and NgBR family proteins from different plant species by BiFC in the <i>N. benthamiana</i> system, but no distinct interaction between LsCPT3 and HRBP can be detected (unpublished data). It is interesting that coexpression of LsCPT3-LsCPTL2 on WRPs caused a slight increase in efficiency of rubber production, whereas that of HRT1-HRBP did not produce such an effect (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Whether similar phenomena are observed using other cPTs and NgBR homologs from NR-producing plants remains to be determined. Taken together with the observation that distinct fluorescent signals for mTq2-fused HRT1 or HRT2 in <i>N. benthamiana</i> cells were detected only when they were co-expressed with mVanus-fused HRBP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), the NgBR family protein may play an important role in proper introduction and folding of cPT or its stabilization on the ER membrane, especially in a heterologous cell expression system, which may be conserved in the RTase in NR-producing plants."

It has been demonstrated that appropriate interactions between lipids and the proteins are required to facilitate accurate folding of membrane proteins during translation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cymer et al., 2015</a>). To date, various methods for cell-free protein synthesis supplemented with biological membranes or membrane-mimicking structures, such as microsomes, micelles, liposomes, bicelles and nanodiscs, have been developed as a promising strategy to obtain functional membrane proteins. However, it has been pointed out that function and activity of the resulting proteins depend critically on properties of the membrane applied, such as lipid composition, phase, tension, fluidity and curvature (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cymer et al., 2015</a>). Although neither HRT1 nor HRT2 have any deduced transmembrane domains (predicted by TMHMM; <a href=\"http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/\">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/</a>), these cPTs may require the membrane environment of RPs or the ER for accurate and functional folding, which is considered to correlate with incorporation of HRT1 into WRPs after cell-free synthesis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In our previous study, the refolded HRT2, heterologously expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and purified under a denaturing condition, was significantly activated by the addition of washed BF (<a href=\"#bib5\">Asawatreratanakul et al., 2003</a>). In this case, the partially unfolded HRT2 might be introduced into some membrane systems in BF, microsomal membranes or contaminated RPs, and refolded to exhibit RTase activity. In the present study, we tested a reconstitution of HRT2 in the WRP-based in vitro translation system. However, the protein level was very low compared to that of HRT1 for unknown reason. Also, the WRPs with recombinantly expressed HRT2 did not show distinct RTase activity (data not shown)."

The architecture of RP is considered to be favourable for accommodation of extraordinarily long polyprenyl products formed by sequential condensation of IPP by an RP-localized RTase (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Whereas non-NR-producing eukaryotes also have organelles with a similar structural property, i.e., an ER-derived lipid droplet consists of a hydrophobic core of lipids, triacylglycerols and steryl esters, surrounded by a lipid monolayer (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chrispeels and Herman, 2000</a>). Srt1p was reported to be localized on lipid droplets in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sato et al., 2001</a>), and Nus1p was also detected on lipid droplets using a proteomic approach (<a href=\"#bib21\">Grillitsch et al., 2011</a>), suggesting co-localization or interaction of these proteins on lipid droplets. The fact that yeast does not show RTase activity suggests that arrangement of a cPT with an NgBR family protein on an organelle with a hydrophobic core to accommodate extraordinarily long polyprenyl products may not be a determinant for modification of the cPT into active RTase."

While subcellular localizations of HRT1 and HRBP are altered from the Golgi to the ER by co-expression of REF, HRT2 is translocated to the plasma membrane, accompanied by HRBP regardless of REF co-expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), suggesting failure of REF to retain the HRT2-HRBP complex in the ER. These results suggest that cell biological roles of HRT2 in laticifer may be different from those of HRT1. Cell biological roles of cPT on the plasma membrane remain to be elucidated and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the identification of a plasma membrane-localised eukaryotic cPT. In addition, <i>HRT1</i> expression is severely restricted in the latex of <i>H. brasiliensis</i>, while <i>HRT2</i> transcripts are detected in various tissues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2014a</a>). According to the functional characterizations of HRT2 heterologously expressed in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Asawatreratanakul et al., 2003</a>) and yeast (<a href=\"#bib57\">Takahashi et al., 2012</a>), HRT2 essentially possess catalytic function as cPT or possibly as RTase. Nevertheless, above-mentioned evidences suggest a possibility that HRT1 may be the principal catalytic component of RTase responsible for NR biosynthesis in <i>H. brasiliensis</i>, although we still consider a possible involvement of other cPTs including HRT2 in the NR biosynthesis. Two mechanisms for the NR biosynthesis have been proposed so far (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rojruthai et al., 2010</a>): the first one is de\u00a0novo formation of NR via sequential <i>cis</i>-1,4-condensation of IPP onto short-chain allylic diphosphates as primer substrates; the second one is elongation or addition of IPP at the \u03b1-terminal reactive moiety of pre-exiting rubber molecules or polyprenyl diphosphates in RPs. The allylic diphosphate primer requirement for the RTase reaction (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>) and no detectable proteins responsible for the short-chain allylic diphosphate biosynthesis on the detergent-washed RPs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a><a href=\"#SD1-data\">)</a> suggest a possibility that HRT1 on WRP catalyzes a de\u00a0novo rubber formation using allylic diphosphate as primer substrates. However, an alternative scenario that HRT2 on the WRPs functions as cPT to form polyprenyl diphosphates, which might be utilised by HRT1 as acceptor substrates in the latter NR biosynthetic mechanism, can not be ruled out."

The amino acid sequence of HRBP shows some similarity to that of HRT1 (sequence identity: 10.9%), although only HRBP is predicted to have a membrane-spanning region at its N-terminus. As the three-dimensional structure of HRT1 is not yet available, the most suitable templates for predicting the structure of HRBP are bacterial cPTs, which are shown to form homodimers within their crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fujihashi et al., 2001</a>). The results from the Y2H and BiFC assays show that HRBP interacts with HRT1, whereas HRT1 does not interact with itself; i.e., HRT1 may form a heteromeric complex with HRBP rather than form a homomultimeric structure on RPs, although HRBP also exhibited self-interaction in the Y2H and BiFC assays. Reconstitution experiments with the two components on WRPs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) support this hypothesis: the reconstituted RTase activity is highest when these two components are expressed. Further experiments are needed to elucidate more precise stoichiometry of the complex."

The results of this study also revealed the function of REF as a module of the RTase machinery. Although we have no data for the stoichiometry of an HRBP-REF complex, specific interaction partnerships, HRT1-HRBP and HRBP-REF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>), and probable formation of the ternary complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) indicate that HRBP functions as a mediating protein between REF and HRT1 to form the ternary complex on RP. Additionally, only when REF was co-expressed with HRT1 and HRBP, the reconstituted RTase activity showed a significant increase. Taken together, the ternary complex including HRT1 may function as rubber-producing machinery on RPs (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of SRPP, another RP-abundant protein in <i>H. brasiliensis</i>, contains a REF-homology domain (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oh et al., 1999</a>). To date, several homologous proteins of SRPP have been identified not only from rubber-producing plants but also non-rubber producing plants, designated as the SRPP family or stress-related protein family (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berthelot et al., 2014a</a>). However, no counterpart of REF, a shorter protein than SRPP family, has been found from other species. <a href=\"#bib31\">Laibach et al. (2015)</a> reported that silencing of a <i>REF</i>-related gene <i>TbREF</i> affected the rubber production in the RP of Russian dandelion, even though this gene is rather homologous to SRPP. It is unknown whether TbREF interacts with other component(s) such as an NgBR homologue of Russian dandelion. The system for in vitro translation-coupled introduction of hydrophobic proteins on RPs, developed in this study, also enables us to shed light on molecular function of REF and SRPP on RPs. Our observations of REF in modulating diameters of WRPs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) represents the first direct evidence of REF being an important protein in the WRP stability. <a href=\"#bib8\">Berthelot et al. (2014b)</a> reported different behaviors of REF and SRPP on model membrane systems, where REF inserts into membranes and disrupts their integrity, whereas SRPP weakly interacts with membranes without any disruption. Since REF is likely to insert itself into RP, it is expected to interact with rubber molecules in RP. Our future plans include study of whether REF controls the turnover of RTase by interacting with the rubber molecule produced by HRT1 in a deeper region of the RP membrane."

This speculation was bolstered by identification of various proteins homologous to vesicular trafficking-related proteins in the ER or Golgi apparatus, on WRPs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). For example, Rab GTPases, RabB (ER to Golgi), RabD (ER to Golgi) and RabH (the Golgi), a Sar1-type coat GTPase (ER to Golgi), a YKT6 type R-SNARE (trans-Golgi network, TGN), and clathrins (TGN) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nielsen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bassham et al., 2008</a>). However, the co-existence of marker proteins for other vesicles involved in different phases of membrane trafficking pathways, e.g. the endocytic/endosomal compartments (RabA, RabC, RabE, RabF, an ArfB-type coat GTPase and clathrins), vacuoles (RabG) and lipid-bodies (\u03b2-1,3-glucase [<a href=\"#bib43\">Paul et al., 2014</a>]), on RPs suggests that RP formation and maturation may be complicated by fusion of multiple vesicles. Different subcellular localization of the protein complexes HRT1\u2013HRBP and HRBP\u2013REF may partly reflect the stepwise formation of the HRT1\u2013HRBP\u2013REF complex on RPs (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). In addition, proteomics of the detergent-washed RPs did not identify any major lipid droplet proteins such as seipin, perilipins or oleosins (<a href=\"#bib35\">Murphy, 2012</a>), consistent with a previous proteomics study of RPs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dai et al., 2013</a>).

Identification of the two partner proteins of HRT1 provides suggestions for possible formation of a ternary complex that functions as the RTase. Although the interactions between cPTs and NgBR homologs are generally assumed in other organisms, HRBP-REF interaction discovered in this study is specific to NR production. Cell biological analyses of the localization of the three components suggest that RPs can be generated by a fusion of various cellular vesicles. We demonstrated in vitro rubber production on WRP for the first time by heterologously expressing cPTs from the Para rubber tree and lettuce, although the assay system developed in this study still included a small amount of endogenous proteins sustained on WRPs. We also showed that HRBP and REF promoted efficient rubber synthesis in the same system when these two proteins were co-expressed with HRT1. Future work will include investigating the structures and functions of the two partner proteins of HRT1. In particular, the effect of REF on the alterations of specific membrane systems is a noteworthy observation. The in vitro translation-coupled protein reconstitution on WRPs is a versatile system for total elucidation of NR biosynthesis and may lead to molecular breeding of transgenic plants with enhanced NR biosynthetic activity."

The 50-\u00b5l portions of the solubilized proteins were then mixed with the custom polyclonal antibody, anti-HRT1/HRT antibody or anti-HRBP antibody, which was prepared from a rabbit injected with two conjugated peptides with specific sequences for HRBP, NH<sub>2</sub>-C+YDSKGVLKTNK-COOH and NH<sub>2</sub>-C+EAVEKDVLLDQKQM-COOH (Eurofins Genomics, Tokyo, Japan), and incubated on ice for 1\u2009hr. Then 10-\u00b5l potion of nProtein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) was added to the solution and incubated on ice for 1\u2009hr with gentle agitations in every 15\u2009min. After the incubations, the solution mixture was centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7g for 2\u2009min followed by removal of the supernatant. Then a precipitated Sepharose gel was washed by 1\u2009ml of phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7g for 2\u2009min. This wash step was repeated at least three times. After the wash, the Sepharose gel was mixed with a sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and heated at 98\u02daC for 5\u2009min. The heated solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7g for 2\u2009min, and the supernatant was analyzed by Western blotting described in above section."

However, the description of WRP is not detailed enough to follow the results perfectly. This could be explained more clearly and precisely in the manuscript; what was the actual compositions of WRP other than RP, discriminating possible contamination of the components HRT1, HRBP and REF in the assay, including comment on other possible <i>cis</i>-preyltransferase such as HRT2. It would be very helpful for the discussion if the authors could indicate the levels of the proteins (and preferably Rase activity) retained on WRPs used for the enzyme assay."

I consider that information about WRPs is too limited in the manuscript, just describing, for example, \"prepared by incubating 50kRP with 8 mM CHAPS for 1 h at 4<sup>o</sup>C\" and \"80% of the RTase activity was retained\".
