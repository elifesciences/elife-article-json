However, we still know little about gene regulation in natural primate populations. We conducted an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based study of baboons from an intensively studied wild population. We performed complementary expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping and allele-specific expression analyses, discovering substantial evidence for, and surprising power to detect, genetic effects on gene expression levels in the baboons. eQTL were most likely to be identified for lineage-specific, rapidly evolving genes; interestingly, genes with eQTL significantly overlapped between baboons and a comparable human eQTL data set. Our results suggest that genes vary in their tolerance of genetic perturbation, and that this property may be conserved across species. Further, they establish the feasibility of eQTL mapping using RNA-seq data alone, and represent an important step towards understanding the genetic architecture of gene expression in primates."

All behavioral, environmental, and demographic data are gathered as part of noninvasive observational monitoring of known individuals within the study population. This research is conducted under the authority of the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), the Kenyan governmental body that oversees wildlife (permit number NCST/5/002/R/777 to SCA and NCST/RCD/12B/012/57 to JT). As the animals are members of a wild population, KWS requires that we do not interfere with injuries to study subjects inflicted by predators, conspecifics, or through other naturally occurring events (e.g., falling out of trees). To collect blood samples, we perform temporary immobilizations using the anesthetic Telazol, delivered via a handheld blowgun. Permission to perform this procedure was granted through KWS, and was performed under the supervision of a KWS-approved Kenyan veterinarian, who monitored anesthetized animals for hypothermia, hyperthermia, and trauma (no such events occurred during our sample collection efforts). Observational and sample collection protocols were approved though IACUC committees at Duke University (current protocol is A028-12-02 to SCA and JT) and the University of Chicago (ACUP 72080 to YG)."

However, we still know little about gene regulation in natural primate populations. We conducted an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based study of baboons from an intensively studied wild population. We performed complementary expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping and allele-specific expression analyses, discovering substantial evidence for, and surprising power to detect, genetic effects on gene expression levels in the baboons. eQTL were most likely to be identified for lineage-specific, rapidly evolving genes; interestingly, genes with eQTL significantly overlapped between baboons and a comparable human eQTL data set. Our results suggest that genes vary in their tolerance of genetic perturbation, and that this property may be conserved across species. Further, they establish the feasibility of eQTL mapping using RNA-seq data alone, and represent an important step towards understanding the genetic architecture of gene expression in primates."

All behavioral, environmental, and demographic data are gathered as part of noninvasive observational monitoring of known individuals within the study population. This research is conducted under the authority of the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), the Kenyan governmental body that oversees wildlife (permit number NCST/5/002/R/777 to SCA and NCST/RCD/12B/012/57 to JT). As the animals are members of a wild population, KWS requires that we do not interfere with injuries to study subjects inflicted by predators, conspecifics, or through other naturally occurring events (e.g., falling out of trees). To collect blood samples, we perform temporary immobilizations using the anesthetic Telazol, delivered via a handheld blowgun. Permission to perform this procedure was granted through KWS, and was performed under the supervision of a KWS-approved Kenyan veterinarian, who monitored anesthetized animals for hypothermia, hyperthermia, and trauma (no such events occurred during our sample collection efforts). Observational and sample collection protocols were approved though IACUC committees at Duke University (current protocol is A028-12-02 to SCA and JT) and the University of Chicago (ACUP 72080 to YG)."

Variation in gene expression levels has been linked to fitness-related morphological, physiological, and behavioral variation in both lab settings and natural populations (e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Abzhanov et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hammock and Young, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Tishkoff et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chan et al., 2010</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib80\">Wray, 2007</a>), and is a robust biomarker of disease in humans (e.g., <a href=\"#bib33\">Golub et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Borovecki et al., 2005</a>). In addition, patterns of gene expression are often associated with signatures of natural selection (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rifkin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Denver et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gilad et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Blekhman et al., 2008</a>), suggesting their functional importance even when their phenotypic significance remains unknown."

For example, gene expression patterns associated with neurological development appear to have experienced an accelerated rate of change in primates relative to other mammals, with axonogenesis-related and cell adhesion-related genes accelerated specifically in the human lineage (<a href=\"#bib16\">Brawand et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, differentially expressed genes in human liver are enriched for metabolic function (<a href=\"#bib14\">Blekhman et al., 2008</a>), suggesting a potential molecular basis for arguments implicating dietary shifts in the emergence of modern humans (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kaplan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Ungar and Teaford, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wrangham, 2009</a>)."

However, in contrast to cross species comparisons, we still know little about the genetic architecture of gene expression levels in natural nonhuman primate populations. No estimates of the heritability of gene expression traits are available, even for populations that have been intensively studied for many decades. We also do not know whether segregating genetic variation that affects gene expression is common or rare, how the effect sizes of such variants are distributed, or whether they carry a signature indicative of natural selection. If gene regulatory variation has indeed been key to primate evolution, as classic arguments suggest (<a href=\"#bib45\">King and Wilson, 1975</a>), then large gaps therefore remain in our understanding of this process."

First, until relatively recently, the only feasible approach for measuring genome-wide gene expression levels on a population scale was microarray technology. This constraint limited the diversity of systems that could be assessed because cost-effective, commercially available arrays have only been developed for a handful of taxa. Second, genomic resources, especially detailed catalogs of known genetic variants (e.g., <a href=\"#bib1\">1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">International HapMap Consortium, 2005</a>), are also limited to a small set of species. The lack of such resources creates major barriers to genome-scale studies of the genetics of gene expression in other organisms, which rely on complementary gene expression and genotype data. Finally, for many taxa, samples suitable for gene expression profiling can be challenging to collect. In nonhuman primates, for example, RNA samples are rarely available even for the most intensively studied natural populations."

Importantly, because fragments of expressed genes are resequenced many times in RNA-seq studies, data on genetic variation are also generated in the process. Although these data can be affected by technical biases, several studies have demonstrated the generally high reliability of genotypes inferred from RNA-seq reads (<a href=\"#bib56\">Perry et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Piskol et al., 2013</a>). Such data can provide important insight into genetic diversity in species for which little other information exists (<a href=\"#bib56\">Perry et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, they provide the two ingredients necessary for mapping gene expression traits to genotype, at moderate cost and without the requirement for previously ascertained genetic variants."

We generated RNA-seq data for 63 individually recognized members of the Amboseli study population. We used these data to explore the frequency, impact, and potential selective relevance of variants associated with variation in gene expression levels, using complementary expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping and allele-specific expression (ASE) approaches. We found evidence for abundant functional regulatory variation in the Amboseli baboons, and a surprising amount of power to detect these variants even with a modest sample size. We also found that functional variants are depleted in highly conserved genes, consistent with constraint on gene expression patterns. However, among genes with eQTL, we did not find strong support for a relationship between effect size and minor allele frequency. Such a relationship would be consistent with pervasive negative selection on gene expression phenotypes (i.e., selection against variants that produce large perturbations in gene expression levels) and has been suggested by work in humans (<a href=\"#bib12\">Battle et al., 2014</a>). Finally, we used our data set to provide the first estimates of the heritability of gene expression levels in wild primates, including the relative contributions of <i>cis</i>-acting and <i>trans</i>-acting genetic variation."

On average, 67.2% of reads mapped to the most recent release of the baboon genome (<i>Panu2</i>.<i>0</i>), 69.2% of which could be assigned to a unique location.

To identify cases of allele-specific expression, which provides independent but complementary evidence for functional <i>cis</i>-regulatory variation, we focused on genes for which multiple heterozygotes were identified for variants in the exonic regions of expressed genes. We also required a minimum total read depth at exonic heterozygous sites of 300 reads (which should provide high power to detect modest ASE: <a href=\"#bib29\">Fontanillas et al., 2010</a>), resulting in a total set of 2280 genes tested for ASE."

At a 10% false discovery rate, we identified eQTL for 1787 (17.2%) of the genes we analyzed, and evidence for ASE for 510 (23.4%) of tested genes. Consistent with reports in humans (e.g., <a href=\"#bib76\">Veyrieras et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pickrell et al., 2010a</a>), eQTL were strongly enriched near gene transcription start sites and in gene bodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; controlling for the background distribution of sites tested, which were also enriched in and around genes). Within gene bodies, eQTL were particularly likely to be detected near transcription end sites; this potentially reflects enrichment in 3\u2032 untranslated regions, which are poorly annotated in baboon. Also as expected, genes with eQTL were more likely to exhibit significant ASE and vice-versa (hypergeometric test: p &lt; 10<sup>\u221225</sup>; <a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). The magnitude and direction of ASE and eQTL were significantly correlated when an eQTL SNP could also be assessed for ASE (n = 123 genes; <i>r</i> = 0.719, p &lt; 10<sup>\u221220</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), and when ASE SNPs were assessed as eQTL (n = 510 genes; <i>r</i> = 0.575, p &lt; 10<sup>\u221245</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Detection of ASE was most strongly favored for highly expressed genes (i.e., higher RPKM: Wilcoxon test: p &lt; 10<sup>\u2212208</sup>; <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>), whereas detection of eQTL was most strongly favored for genes with high local SNP density (p &lt; 10<sup>\u221272</sup>; <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>)."

Further, while thousands of <i>cis</i>-eQTL have been mapped in single human populations, doing so has generally required sample sizes several fold larger than ours (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lappalainen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Battle et al., 2014</a>)."

Using our approach for estimating and modeling the gene expression data, but obtaining the genotype data from an independent array platform, we could identify 700 genes with significant eQTL in the YRI data set at a 10% FDR. Approximately half (51%) could be recovered if we only focused on SNPs in transcribed regions. This number (n = 357) therefore reflects the likely theoretical limit of detection for performing eQTL mapping in which SNPs are called based on RNA-seq data. Indeed, when eQTL mapping for the YRI was conducted using genotype data obtained from RNA-seq reads (i.e., the same pipeline used for the baboons), we identified 290 genes with eQTL (41.4% of those identified using independently collected genotype data). eQTL identified in the RNA-seq pipeline do not differ from those identified only in the conventional pipeline in either effect size or in surrounding sequence conservation, but do tend to fall in more highly expressed genes (Wilcoxon test on RPKM values: p = 6.53 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup>; <a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9</a>), suggesting that sequencing coverage considerations reduce the number of identifiable eQTL below the theoretical maximum. The RNA-seq-based pipeline therefore reduces the number of genes with detectable eQTL by 50\u201360%, suggesting that if genotyping array data had been available for the baboons, we might have identified eQTL for \u223c3500\u20134000 genes, comparable to results from human data sets with more than 350 samples (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lappalainen et al., 2013</a>).

First, we simulated the effect size of the eQTL, with possible effect sizes ranging from 0.25 to 2.5, in intervals of 0.25 (effect sizes are relative to a standard normal distribution). The power to detect an eQTL of a given effect size is contingent on the relative representation of different genotype classes in a population, and hence MAF (larger MAFs produce a more balanced set of alternative genotypes, and thus more power). Second, we simulated the proportion of variance in gene expression levels (PVE) explained by the eQTL, with possible PVE values ranging from 5% to 50%, in intervals of 5%. In this case, power to detect an eQTL does not depend on MAF because simulating the PVE directly integrates across the combined impact of effect size and MAF (a simulated high PVE eQTL with low MAF implies a large effect size variant). Thus, the impact of the MAF spectrum on the power to detect eQTL is reflected in the differences in power between the baboon data set and the YRI data set in the effect size-based vs the PVE-based simulations. In all cases, we calculated power as the proportion of genes with simulated eQTL recovered at a 10% FDR."

To quantify the power to detect eQTL under this scenario, we again simulated eQTL among genes in the baboon and YRI data sets, but masked the causal sites. Doing so revealed much greater power to identify eQTL in baboons than in humans, across all values of simulated PVE or effect size (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). One possible explanation for this observation stems from increased genetic diversity in the baboons compared to the YRI. Indeed, in baboons we tested an average of 45.4 (\u00b157.0 s.d.) genetic variants for each gene, whereas applying the same pipeline in YRI yielded an average of 20.3 (\u00b121.4 s.d.) testable variants per gene. An alternative explanation relates to patterns of LD, which we estimate to decay somewhat more slowly in the baboons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, inset). Higher SNP density in baboons increases the likelihood that, when a causal SNP is not typed, a nearby SNP will be available that tags it. Longer range LD suggests that a given SNP could also tag distant causal variants more effectively."

Further, considering that the effect size estimates in baboons tended to be larger than in the YRI (mean of 0.96 in baboons vs mean of 0.80 in YRI), the actual fold increase estimated from simulations is approximately 6-fold (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>: ratio of purple vs orange lines at these effect sizes). This estimate is remarkably consistent with empirical results from our comparison of the real baboon and YRI data, in which we identified 6.16-fold the number of eQTL in the baboons. One possibility is that this difference arises from a history of known admixture in Amboseli between the dominant yellow baboon population and immigrant anubis baboons (<i>Papio anubis</i>: <a href=\"#bib3\">Alberts and Altmann, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Tung et al., 2008</a>). Thus, it might reflect the difference between an admixed population and an unadmixed population rather than a difference between species. However, this explanation seems unlikely because evidence for ASE does not extend further from tested genes in baboons compared to YRI (<a href=\"#fig1s10\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 10</a>), and because adding controls for local (chromosome-specific) structure when testing for eQTL still results in a large excess of eQTL detected in the baboon data set (\u223c7\u00d7 higher than in YRI: \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig1s11\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 11</a>)"

More conserved genes also tend to have slightly lower average minor allele frequencies (p = 0.002), which might reduce the power to detect eQTL (although the effect size is small: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.001). However, genes with eQTL in both species were also less likely to have orthologues in deeply diverged species, based on conservation in Homologene (<i>\u03b2</i> = \u22120.036, p = 1.78 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Genetic diversity within the baboons is very weakly correlated with Homologene conservation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.004) and uncorrelated with average minor allele frequency (p = 0.38). Thus, sequence-level conservation scores and depth of homology across species combine to suggest that eQTL\u2014or at least those with relatively large effect sizes\u2014are least likely to be detected for strongly conserved loci, and most likely to be detected for lineage-specific, rapidly evolving genes. Consistent with this idea, genes involved in basic cellular metabolic processes were under-enriched among the set of genes with eQTL in both species, and enriched among the set of genes for which no eQTL were detected in either species (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B\u2013C</a>). The set of genes with eQTL in either or both species, on the other hand, were enriched for loci involved in antigen processing, catalytic activity, and interaction with the extracellular environment (e.g., receptors, membrane-associated proteins)."

This pattern could arise if selection acts against large genetic perturbations, such that variants of large effect would be present only at low frequencies. Consistent with this idea, plotting eQTL effect size vs MAF in the baboons results in a very strong, highly significant negative correlation (r = \u22120.723, p &lt; 10<sup>\u2212280</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), with no large effect eQTL detected at higher MAFs. However, such a relationship could also be a consequence of the so-called winner's curse (in which sampling variance leads to upwardly biased effect size estimates: <a href=\"#bib84\">Z\u00f6llner and Pritchard, 2007</a>) because the degree of bias in effect size estimation is itself negatively correlated with MAF. Indeed, when we simulated sets of eQTL with constant small effect sizes (<i>\u03b2</i> = 0.75, close to the mean effect size detected for SNPs with MAF \u22650.4), we found that the relationship between estimated effect size and MAF among detected eQTL almost perfectly recapitulated the observed negative correlation. Hence, the correlation between estimated eQTL effect size and MAF in the baboons does not provide strong support for widespread negative selection on gene expression phenotypes within species. We note, however, that our sample size of individuals is much smaller than that used for a similar analysis in humans (<a href=\"#bib12\">Battle et al., 2014</a>: n = 922 individuals), and larger sample sizes should attenuate winner's curse effects."

We focused specifically on three social environmental variables of known importance in this population, all of which have been extensively investigated as models for human social environments. These were: (i) early life social status, which predicts growth and maturation rates (<a href=\"#bib5\">Altmann and Alberts, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Charpentier et al., 2008</a>); (ii) maternal social connectedness to other females, which predicts both adult lifespan and the survival of a female's infants (<a href=\"#bib65\">Silk et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Archie et al., 2014</a>); and (iii) maternal social connectedness to males, based on recent evidence that heterosexual relationships have strong effects on survival as well (<a href=\"#bib7\">Archie et al., 2014</a>)."

Again similar to humans (<a href=\"#bib62\">Price et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wright et al., 2014</a>), we found that more of the additive genetic PVE is explained by the <i>trans</i> component (median PVE = 23.8%) than the <i>cis</i> component (median PVE = 2.9%) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

However, increasing evidence indicates that humans are demographically unusual: compared to other primates, humans exhibit low levels of neutral genetic diversity and a low long-term effective population size (<a href=\"#bib21\">Chen and Li, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hernandez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Perry et al., 2012</a>). Further, humans are distinguished from other primates by recent explosive population growth (<a href=\"#bib43\">Keinan and Clark, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tennessen et al., 2012</a>). While late Pleistocene population expansion has been suggested for some nonhuman primates, including chimpanzees and Chinese-origin rhesus macaques (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hernandez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wegmann and Excoffier, 2010</a>), none have undergone the extreme levels of population increase that characterized humans. Indeed, evidence from microsatellite data suggests that the long-term effective population size of baboons actually may have contracted during this period (<a href=\"#bib70\">Storz et al., 2002</a>)."

Differences in demographic history not only affect overall levels of genetic variation and the minor allele frequency spectrum, but also the mean effect size of sites that contribute to phenotypic variation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lohmueller, 2014</a>). Interestingly, demographic history does not impact overall trait heritability (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lohmueller, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Simons et al., 2014</a>), perhaps explaining why we estimated mean additive genetic PVEs for gene expression levels in baboons that are similar to those estimated for humans. However, demographic history can influence the power to detect individual genetic contributions to phenotypic variation. Large-scale population expansion of the type that occurred in human history appears to reduce power to identify genotype-phenotype correlations for fitness-related traits (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lohmueller, 2014</a>). This observation may account, in part, for our ability to identify many more functional regulatory variants in the baboons than we expected based on previous studies in humans."

Specifically, within the baboons alone, we found that the negative relationship between eQTL effect size and minor allele frequency was explicable based on winner's curse effects alone. Thus, increased power to identify functional regulatory variants in the baboons is probably not due to pervasive associations between gene expression levels and fitness. In contrast, stronger evidence for selection on gene expression patterns stems from our cross species comparisons. In particular, we observed that genes with eQTL in baboons significantly overlapped with genes with eQTL in humans, and that these genes as a class also tended to be less constrained at the sequence-level (consistent with observations for analyses of <i>cis-</i>eQTL in humans alone: <a href=\"#bib61\">Popadin et al., 2014</a>). This result suggests that genes vary in their tolerance of functional regulatory genetic variation, and, intriguingly, that gene-specific robustness to genetic perturbation may be a conserved property across species."

In particular, the population has experienced recent admixture between yellow baboons, the dominant taxon, and closely related anubis baboons (<i>P. anubis</i>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alberts and Altmann, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Tung et al., 2008</a>). Admixture, which appears to be relatively common in natural populations (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mallet, 2005</a>), can have important consequences for genetic diversity and LD patterns. While it appears to have had a modest impact on the relative ability to map gene expression phenotypes in baboons vs the YRI data set, comparison to a non-admixed baboon population could help resolve this question further. More generally, our results encourage further investigation of the relationship between demography and trait genetic architecture in other populations, as has been suggested for humans (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lohmueller, 2014</a>) but could also be profitably extended to nonhuman model systems. Such comparisons would provide an empirical basis for testing predicted relationships between demographic history and the power to identify genotype-phenotype associations. From an applied perspective, they could also help identify animal models that favor more highly powered association mapping studies, a strategy that has already been heavily exploited in domestic dogs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Karlsson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Karlsson and Lindblad-Toh, 2008</a>) and suggested for rhesus macaques (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hernandez et al., 2007</a>). While the same sites will probably rarely be associated with the same traits across species, this strategy could help identify molecular mechanisms that are conserved across humans and animal models (e.g., <a href=\"#bib46\">Lamason et al., 2005</a>). Comparisons that use matched sample types will be particularly informative: our study compared eQTL detection in whole blood (from the baboons) with eQTL from lymphoblastoid cell lines (YRI), which exhibit highly correlated, but not identical, patterns of overall gene expression (Spearman's rho = 0.645, p &lt; 1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>)\u2014these differences could affect rates of eQTL detection as well."

Intensively studied natural primate populations\u2014some of which have been studied continuously for 30 or more years\u2014have emerged as important phenotypic models for human behavior, health, and aging. The approach we used here provides a way to leverage these models for complementary genetic studies as well, especially if eQTL prove to be strongly enriched for sites associated with other traits, as in humans (<a href=\"#bib55\">Nicolae et al., 2010</a>). Although preliminary, our results highlight the increasing feasibility of integrating functional genomic data with phenotypic data on known individuals in the wild. For example, our data set revealed a number of genes in which variation in gene expression levels could be mapped to an identifiable eQTL, validated using an ASE approach, and also linked to early life environmental variation. Such cases suggest the potential for future investigations of the molecular basis of persistent environmental effects, including whether genetic and environmental effects act additively or interact."

Study subjects were darted opportunistically between 2009 and 2011, avoiding females with dependent infants and pregnant females beyond the first trimester of pregnancy (female reproductive status is closely monitored in this population, and conception dates can be estimated with a high degree of accuracy). Following anesthetization, animals were quickly transferred to a processing site distant from the rest of the group. Blood samples for RNA-seq analysis were collected by drawing 2.5 ml of whole blood into PaxGene Vacutainer tubes (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), which contain a lysis buffer that stabilizes RNA for downstream use. Following sample collection, study subjects were allowed to regain consciousness in a covered holding cage until fully recovered from the effects of the anesthetic.

To recover reads that spanned putative exon\u2013exon junctions, and therefore could not be mapped directly to the genome, we used the program <i>jfinder</i> on reads that did not initially map (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pickrell et al., 2010b</a>). Finally, we filtered the resulting mapped reads data for low quality reads (quality score &lt;10) and for reads that did not map to a unique position in the genome. To assign reads to genes, we used the RefSeq exon annotations for <i>Panu</i> 2.0 (<i>ref_Panu_2.0_top_level.gff3</i>, downloaded September 6, 2012).

Because no validated reference set of known genetic variants are available for baboon, we performed an iterative bootstrapping procedure for base quality score recalibration. Specifically, we performed an initial round of base quality score recalibration and identified a set of variants using GATK's UnifiedGenotyper and VariantFiltration walker. From this call set, we constructed a set of high confidence variants with quality score \u2265100 that passed all filters for variant confidence (variants failed if QD &lt; 2.0), mapping quality (variants failed if MQ &lt; 35.0), strand bias (variants failed if FS &gt; 60.0), haplotype score (variants failed if HaplotypeScore &gt;13.0), mapping quality (variants failed if MQRankSum &lt; \u221212.5) and read position bias (variants failed if ReadPosRankSum &lt; \u22128.0). We used this high confidence set as the set of \u2018known sites\u2019 in a second round of base quality score recalibration, repeating this procedure until the number of variants identified in consecutive rounds of recalibration stabilized. In the final call set, we removed all sites (i) that were monomorphic in the Amboseli samples; (ii) for which genotype data were missing for more than 12 individuals (19%) in the data set; (iii) that deviated from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium; and (iv) that failed the above quality control filters. We further filtered the data set to contain only sites with a minimum quality score of 100 that were located within 200 kb of a gene of interest, and that were sequenced at a mean coverage \u22655\u00d7 across all samples. We validated our quality control and filtering steps by performing the same procedure on an RNA-seq data set from the HapMap Yoruba population (see below). These steps resulted in a set of 64,432 single nucleotide polymorphisms carried forward into downstream analysis (30,938 for the YRI).

If so, heterozygotes might be mistakenly genotyped as homozygotes for the high expressing allele, resulting in an underrepresentation of heterozygous genotypes relative to neutral expectations. To control for this possibility, we eliminated sites that violated Hardy-Weinberg expectations (n = 2386) from our analyses. We note, however, that this scenario would not introduce false positives. Instead, it would lead to more conservative detection of additive eQTL effects, with the direction of an estimated eQTL effect still consistent with the true effect."

This bias would result in higher apparent expression levels for alternate allele homozygotes and lower expression levels for reference allele homozygotes, which could create false positive eQTLs. However, we observe no evidence for this scenario in our data set. For all tested SNPs (n = 64,432) and for eQTL SNPs only (n = 1693), alternate allele homozygotes tend to have slightly lower coverage than reference allele homozygotes, and heterozygotes tend to have the highest coverage (because more reads are required to support inference of heterozygosity) (<a href=\"#fig1s13\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 13</a>). Thus, coverage and genotype do not covary additively, and this potential confound is unlikely to produce false positive eQTLs."

This possibility is consistent with our observation that alternate allele homozygotes tend to have slightly less coverage than reference allele homozygotes (<a href=\"#fig1s13\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 13</a>). While this difference in coverage is significant (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup> for all SNPs; p = 3.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup> for eQTL SNPs), the magnitude of the effect itself is modest (<a href=\"#fig1s13\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 13</a>), probably because we allowed reads to map with up to three mismatches: Wittkopp and colleagues have shown that reference allele mapping bias is largely obviated by allowing reads to map with more mismatches (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stevenson et al., 2013</a>). Further, systematic calling of false positive eQTLs due to biased read mapping would predict a bias towards negative effect sizes (i.e., eQTL effects suggesting that the alternate allele is associated with lower expression levels). Our data are not consistent with such a pattern: 47% of eQTL betas are negative, whereas 53% are positive. Reference allele mapping biases are, however, more likely to affect ASE analysis, producing a pattern of greater expression in the reference allele. Indeed, we do observe a bias towards negative betas in the ASE analysis (67.2% of n = 510 genes), although the overall magnitude and direction of ASE data agree well with eQTL evidence."

To test this possibility, we recoded eQTL effects to reflect the effect of the major allele instead of the effect of the alternate allele (i.e., a genotype of 0 = homozygous minor and a genotype of 2 = homozygous major). We observed a modest excess of eQTL for which the major allele was associated with lower gene expression levels (56%, binomial test p = 1.15 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22127</sup>). This bias did not differ depending on whether the major allele was the reference allele or the alternate allele (Fisher's Exact Test, p = 0.28), supporting minimal read mapping biases in our data. Instead, it appears to be primarily driven by SNPs with low minor allele frequencies (proportion of negative betas for the lowest quartile of MAFs = 62.8%, p = 7.49 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>; highest quartile of MAFs = 48.6%, p = 0.602). At these sites, eQTL inference relies primarily on two genotype classes (the major allele homozygotes and heterozygotes) rather than three genotype classes. Because heterozygotes tend to have slightly higher coverage than homozygotes of both classes, spurious relationships between genotype and gene expression levels are much less likely to be observed when both types of homozygotes are well represented (i.e., MAFs are larger)."

The eQTL identified in YRI in the conventional pipeline vs the RNA-seq pipeline offer a further source of comparison. We find that eQTL identified through the RNA-seq pipeline tend to be associated with more highly expressed genes (providing greater power to call genotypes: Wilcoxon test p = 6.53<sup>\u22129</sup>), but otherwise do not differ in sequence conservation (phyloP scores: p = 0.707; Homologene scores: p = 0.603) or in estimated effect size (p = 0.137) (<a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9</a>). Further, effect size magnitude is highly correlated across pipelines when eQTL are discovered in both pipelines (r = 0.874, p &lt; 10<sup>\u221257</sup>). When eQTL were discovered only in the RNA-seq pipeline (n = 104), they tended to be high on the ranked list of eQTL evidence in the conventional pipeline as well (median rank of 1395, where the top 700 were significant and 10,615 genes were tested), suggesting that many of them did not pass the threshold for eQTL detection in that analysis. Thus, the most salient source of error stems from low MAF sites, which are also the cases most vulnerable to sampling error and winner's curse effects more generally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)\u2014a problem that is not confined to RNA-seq-based eQTL mapping. Taken together, these analyses argue that, as a general rule, eQTL associated with lower MAF SNPs should be treated with increased caution."

We used different priors for <i>cis</i>-acting effects and <i>trans</i>-acting effects to capture different properties for the two components. Specifically, the spike-slab prior on the <i>cis</i> effects \u03b2<sub>cis</sub> captures our prior belief that only a small proportion of local SNPs has <i>cis</i> effects and these effects are relatively large. The normal prior on the <i>trans</i> effects captures our prior knowledge that <i>trans</i>-acting SNPs tend to be relatively difficult to find and have relatively small effects. In addition, because p<sub>cis</sub> is small and p<sub>trans</sub> approximately equals p, the number of total SNPs, we used p instead of p<sub>trans</sub> to facilitate computation (i.e., p<sub>trans</sub> was based on all genotyped sites used in our analyses, n = 64,432). Results are qualitatively similar if p<sub>trans</sub> is calculated based on sites that must act in <i>trans</i> (i.e., sites located on a different chromosome than the chromosome containing the gene of interest: <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to fit the model with 1000 burn-in and 10,000 sampling steps. We obtained posterior samples of \u03b2<sub>cis</sub> and \u03b2<sub>trans</sub> to calculate the PVE attributed by each of the two components, as well as the total additive genetic PVE contributed by both components."

Sex was known from direct observation of the study subjects. Ages were known to within a few days' error for 52 of the 63 individuals in the data set; six animals had birth dates estimated to be accurate within 1 year, four animals had birth dates estimated to be accurate within 2 years, and one had a birth date estimated to be less accurate than 2 years. Early social status was measured using the proportional dominance rank of the individual's mother, at the time of that individual's conception. Dominance ranks are assigned monthly using <i>ad libitum</i> observations of dyadic agonistic (aggressive or competitive) encounters within social groups (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hausfater, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Alberts et al., 2003</a>). Maternal social connectedness values were defined as the social connectedness of the individual's mother, in the year of that female's life during which the focal individual was born. Social connectedness is calculated on a yearly basis as the frequency with which a female was involved in affiliative interactions, relative to the median for all females in the population at the same time and controlling for observer effort (see <a href=\"#bib64\">Runcie et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Archie et al., 2014</a>). Social connectedness is measured for females, but can focus on either female\u2013female relationships (SCI-F) or a female's relationship with adult males (SCI-M), which have independent effects on longevity in this population (<a href=\"#bib7\">Archie et al., 2014</a>). For SCI-F, affiliative interactions included both grooming interactions and close spatial proximity to other females. For SCI-M, only grooming interactions were used."

For (ii), we used a maximum likelihood approach to estimate both the alpha and beta parameters in the beta component of the beta-binomial model; we have clarified this point in the same subsection of the Materials and methods of the revised manuscript. To address point (iii), we have now tested whether ASE is more likely to be detected for sites with more heterozygous individuals, conditional on total read depth (overall, number of hets and total read depth are correlated: r = 0.266, p &lt; 10<sup>-100</sup>).

We have now calculated the correlation between levels of conservation and average minor allele frequency for each gene, for SNPs used in our analysis. The correlation between a gene\u2019s average phyloP score (from the 46-way primate comparison) and the average MAF of all SNPs tested in association with that gene is nominally significant (p = 0.002) but explains a very small fraction of the variance (r = -0.037). Thus, while more conserved genes do tend to have lower average MAFs (among SNPs tested), this relationship is weak, probably because we filter out sites with very low MAFs and because many sites occur in non-protein coding regions of the transcript or in the transcribed regions of other genes. Further, we observe no significant correlation between a gene\u2019s Homologene score and average minor allele frequency among SNPs tested (p = 0.38). These analyses suggest that the relationship between conservation and eQTL discovery is probably not driven by a relationship between conservation and MAF (at least within the data set we ultimately analyzed). We have discussed this point in the revised manuscript (under the heading \u201cMixed evidence for nature selectin of gene expression levels\u201d, in the Results section). We also cite a recent paper by Popadin et al. (third paragraph of the Discussion) that also suggests that fewer <i>cis</i>-eQTL are found in older genes, similar to our findings for the Homologene analysis."
