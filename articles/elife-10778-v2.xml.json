An important question about the brain is how much information can be stored at a synapse through synaptic plasticity, which depends on the history of probabilistic synaptic activity. The strong correlation between size and efficacy of a synapse allowed us to estimate the variability of synaptic plasticity. In an EM reconstruction of hippocampal neuropil we found single axons making two or more synaptic contacts onto the same dendrites, having shared histories of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. The spine heads and neck diameters, but not neck lengths, of these pairs were nearly identical in size. We found that there is a minimum of 26 distinguishable synaptic strengths, corresponding to storing 4.7 bits of information at each synapse. Because of stochastic variability of synaptic activation the observed precision requires averaging activity over several minutes."

An important question about the brain is how much information can be stored at a synapse through synaptic plasticity, which depends on the history of probabilistic synaptic activity. The strong correlation between size and efficacy of a synapse allowed us to estimate the variability of synaptic plasticity. In an EM reconstruction of hippocampal neuropil we found single axons making two or more synaptic contacts onto the same dendrites, having shared histories of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. The spine heads and neck diameters, but not neck lengths, of these pairs were nearly identical in size. We found that there is a minimum of 26 distinguishable synaptic strengths, corresponding to storing 4.7 bits of information at each synapse. Because of stochastic variability of synaptic activation the observed precision requires averaging activity over several minutes."

In the brain, information is stored in the form of synaptic strength, a measure of how strongly activity in one neuron influences another neuron to which it is connected. The number of different strengths can be measured in bits. The total storage capacity of the brain therefore depends on both the number of synapses and the number of distinguishable synaptic strengths."

The cell body bears numerous short branches called dendrites, which are covered in tiny protrusions, or \u201cspines\u201d. Most excitatory synapses are formed between the axon of one neuron and a dendritic spine on another. When two neurons on either side of a synapse are active simultaneously, that synapse becomes stronger, a form of memory. The dendritic spine also becomes larger to accommodate the extra molecular machinery needed to support a stronger synapse."

These synapses should be the same strength because they will have experienced the same history of neural activity. Bartol et al. used a technique called serial section electron microscopy to create a 3D reconstruction of part of the brain that allowed the sizes of the dendritic spines these synapses form on to be compared. This revealed that the synaptic areas and volumes of the spine heads were nearly identical. This remarkable similarity can be used to estimate the number of bits of information that a single synapse can store, since the size of dendritic spines and their synapses can be used as proxies for synaptic strength."

It implies that the total memory capacity of the brain \u2013 with its many trillions of synapses \u2013 may have been underestimated by an order of magnitude. Additional measurements in the same and other brain regions are needed to confirm this possibility."

Synapses in the hippocampus are involved in the formation of new declarative memories. Understanding how and why synaptic strengths undergo changes in the hippocampus is important for understanding how we remember facts about the world. A fundamental question is the degree of precision in the adjustment of synaptic strengths in view of the many sources of variability at synapses. In this study we provide an upper bound on the variability of synaptic plasticity and quantify a lower bound on the amount of information that can be stored at a single synapse."

Anatomical measurements of the spine size, the area of the postsynaptic density (PSD), the number of AMPA receptors, the area of the presynaptic active zone and the number of docked vesicles in the presynaptic terminal are all highly correlated with each other and with physiological measurements of the release probability and the efficacy of the synapse (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harris and Stevens, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lisman and Harris, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Harris and Sultan, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Murthy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Branco et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bourne et al., 2013</a>). Thus, each of these individual characteristics is a correlate of synaptic strength.

Due to the high failure rate and other sources of stochastic variability at synapses one might expect that the precision of changes in the strengths of these synapses <i>in vivo</i> to be low. The failure rate at synapses depends inversely on the strength, and therefore the size, of the synapse. On this basis the strengths of weaker, and therefore smaller and less reliable synapses, would be expected to be less precisely controlled than the larger and stronger synapses, which have a lower failure rate."

Prior work suggests that such pairs of spines are more similar in size than those from the same axon on different dendrites (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sorra and Harris, 1993</a>). Here we evaluated this axon-spine coupling in a complete nanoconnectomic three-dimensional reconstruction from serial electron microscopy (3DEM)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Harris et al., 2015</a>) of hippocampal neuropil. We determined the similarity of synapses among pairs of spines and set an upper bound on the variability and the time window over which pre- and postsynaptic histories would need to be averaged to achieve the observed precision."

We identified 449 synapses, 446 axons and 149 dendrites, which except for one identified branch point, are likely to originate from different neurons based on the size of the reconstructed volume and the obtuse branching angles of dendrites from these neurons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ishizuka et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Meg\u0131\u0301as et al., 1997</a>). We measured spine head volume and surface area, surface area of the postsynaptic density (PSD) adjacent to the presynaptic active zone, and spine neck volume, neck length and neck diameter at the 287 spines that were fully contained within the volume. We also quantified the number of vesicles at the 236 spines and presynaptic boutons that were fully contained within the volume. The strong correlations between these metrics, the skewed shape of the frequency histograms, and the number of synapses per unit of volume (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>), are consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harris and Stevens, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sorra et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bourne and Harris, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bourne et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bell et al., 2014</a>). To reduce error, we averaged over multiple independent spine volume measurements for each spine (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We determined that the relationship between PSD area and spine head volume did not differ significantly across different dendrites (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The correlation between spine head area and spine head volume accounted for 99% of the variance, despite the wide range in spine head shapes and dimensions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which suggests that the accuracy of our measurements matched the precision of the spine. We also measured spine neck length, diameter, and volume and found a\u00a0weak\u00a0trend between the neck diameter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and spine head volume but no correlation between neck length (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and spine head volume, consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harris and Stevens, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">T\u00f8nnesen et al., 2014</a>)."

A larger central spine between two similar in size (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, \u2018k, l, m\u2019) produces one same size pair (\u2018k\u2019 ) and two different size pairs (\u2018 l\u2019, \u2018m\u2019). This unusual configuration is probably driven by processes, such as competition for available resources, that differ from the other pairs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sorra and Harris, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sorra et al., 1998</a>). As one possibility, perhaps the the size of the larger postsynaptic spine was influenced by the larger size of the available pool of presynaptic vesicles in close proximity to its active zone. Excluding this triple synapse, the median value of the coefficient of variation of volume differences between pairs was CV = 0.083 and was as precise for small synapses as it was for large ones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This precision (i.e. low CV) suggests that accurately maintaining the size of every synapse, regardless of size and strength, could be important for the function, flexibility and computational power of the hippocampus."

Signal detection theory holds that at a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 1, a common detection threshold used in psychophysical experiments, an ideal observer can correctly detect whether a signal is higher or lower than some threshold 69% of the time (<a href=\"#bib19\">Green and Swets, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schultz, 2007</a>). Put another way, if random samples are drawn from two Gaussian distributions whose areas overlap by 31%, an ideal observer will correctly assign a given sample to the correct distribution 69% of the time. Using this logic, we found that ~26 different mean synaptic strengths could span the entire range, assuming CV = 0.083 for each strength level, and a 69% discrimination threshold (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, see Materials and methods). These 26 distinct strength levels can be represented with 4.7 bits of information (i.e. 2<sup>4.7</sup> \u2248 26) which means 4.7 bits of information that can be stored at each synapse as synaptic strength.

Let us first consider release caused by single action potentials, ignoring short-term plasticity. Release of this type can be analyzed using a binomial model in which n presynaptic action potentials, each with a probability p<sub>r</sub> of releasing one or more vesicles, leads to a mean number of releases <i>\u03bc</i> = <i>n</i>*<i>p<sub>r</sub></i> having variance <i>\u03c3</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>n</i>*<i>p<sub>r</sub></i>*(1\u2212<i>p<sub>r</sub></i>).

Our dense reconstruction included a complete inventory of every synapse in the reconstructed volume and in this respect was unbiased. Additional pairs of synapses from two other rats confirmed that this finding is not confined to a single brain. Of course, additional measurements in the hippocampus and other brain regions would be needed to confirm and extend this finding. The very high statistical significance of the finding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, KS test p=0.0002) despite a relatively small number of pairs in our sample implies a large effect magnitude, which would be much smaller if many more samples were needed to reach the same level of significance.

Since the correlations between the head sizes of axon-coupled pairs of spines is high, the high correlation between the PSD areas and numbers of docked vesicles observed in axon-coupled spines is not surprising (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E and 4F</a>). However, it was unexpected to find that the spine neck diameters were also highly correlated between axon-coupled pairs of spines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>\u00a0r<sup>2</sup>=0.70), since the correlation between spine head volumes and spine neck diameters is not statistically significant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Thus, there are at least two geometric aspects of the spine geometry that are under tight control of synaptic plasticity, which may reflect different aspects of synaptic function. The diameter of the spine neck may reflect the need for trafficking of materials between the spine shaft and spine head, which is known to be regulated by LTP and LTD (<a href=\"#bib1\">Araki et al., 2015</a>)."

In a recent connectomic reconstruction of the mouse cortex, the similarity in the volumes of axon-coupled pairs of dendritic spines were statistically significant (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kasthuri et al., 2015</a>).

Related to this question, two synapses from the same axon on two different dendrites of the same neuron might not share the same postsynaptic history. These questions cannot be answered with our current data due to the small dimensions and the fact that the position in the neuropil from which our reconstruction was taken makes it highly unlikely that any of the dendrites, other than the one branch point captured in the volume, belong to the same neuron (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ishizuka et al., 1995</a>).

It is possible that the large, central spine had an effectively larger pool of vesicles by virtue of proximity, whereas the two synapses on the outside had a more limited population to draw from, and the size of the postsynaptic spine was influenced by the size of the available pool. More examples are needed before we can reach any conclusions.

Long-term changes in the structure of the synapse and the efficacy of synaptic transmission are triggered by the entry of calcium into the spine. A strategy for identifying the time-averaging mechanism is to follow the calcium. Phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), required for spike-timing dependent plasticity processes, integrates calcium signals over minutes to hours and is a critical step in enzyme cascades leading to structural changes induced by long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kennedy et al., 2005</a>), including rearrangements of the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kram\u00e1r et al., 2012</a>). The time window over which CaMKII integrates calcium signals is within the range of time windows we predict would be needed to achieve the observed precision (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Similar time windows occur in synaptic tagging and capture, which also requires CaMKII (<a href=\"#bib44\">Redondo and Morris, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de Carvalho Myskiw et al., 2014</a>). These observations suggest that biochemical pathways within the postsynaptic spine have the long time scales required to record and maintain the history of activity patterns leading to structural changes in the size of the spine heads."

But due to the many sources of variability, this information cannot be read out with a single input spike. This apparent limitation may have several advantages. First, the stochastic variability might reflect a sampling strategy designed for energetic efficiency since it is the physical substrate that must be stable for long-term memory retention, not the read out of individual spikes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Laughlin and Sejnowski, 2003</a>). Second, some algorithms depend on stochastic sampling, such as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves estimates by sampling from probability distributions, and can be used for Bayesian inference (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gamerman and Lopes, 2006</a>). Each synapse in essence samples from a probability distribution with a highly accurate mean, which collectively produces a sample from the joint probability distribution across all synapses. A final advantage derives from the problem of overfitting, which occurs when the number of parameters in a model is very large. This problem can be ameliorated by \u2018drop out\u2019, a procedure in which only a random fraction of the elements in the model are used on any given trial (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Srivastava et al., 2014</a>). Drop out regularizes the learning since a different network is being used on every learning trial, which reduces co-adaptation and overfitting."

Much can be learned about the computational resources of synapses by exploring axon-coupled synaptic pairs in other brain regions and in other species."

To accomplish this, contours were hand-drawn on each serial section micrograph closely encompassing, as a single closed contour, the pre- and post-synaptic extent of the electron dense region. Taken together, the stack of contours for a given PSD-AZ forms a 3D capsule which encloses the entire feature. VolRoverN (<a href=\"#bib14\">Edwards et al., 2014</a>) was used to reconstruct the 3D surface of the capsule enclosing each PSD-AZ pair in 3D. Because these capsules enclose the intracellular domain of both the PSD and AZ they also overlap with the pre- and post-synaptic membrane associated with these subcellular features. Each of these closed capsules was then used as a \u20183D lasso\u2019 to tag mesh triangles of the pre- and post-synaptic membrane contained within the lasso, marking the enclosed membrane area as a synaptic contact region\u2014PSD postsynaptically and AZ presynaptically. <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> shows a postsynaptic contact area labeled in red on a dendritic spine."

By completely reconstructing a small volume of hippocampus, the authors demonstrate that pairs of synapses between the same dendrite and axon have highly correlated sizes (and therefore from earlier work) strength. The finding, that synapses that share an axon and a dendritic branch are very similar in size, is a very important confirmation of the notion that it is the history of correlated pre- and post-synaptic activity that determines synapse size and strength. The data were carefully and creatively analyzed. The results are convincing because they have been reproduced in three animals (a very time consuming task) and because of the high p values."
