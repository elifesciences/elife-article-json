However, the mechanisms by which receptors enable this concerted cellular response remain unclear. To investigate the effect of cellular tension on cell surface receptors, we combined novel high-resolution imaging and single particle tracking with established biochemical assays to examine TGF\u03b2 signaling. We find that TGF\u03b2 receptors are discretely organized to segregated spatial domains at the cell surface. Integrin-rich focal adhesions organize T\u03b2RII around T\u03b2RI, limiting the integration of T\u03b2RII while sequestering T\u03b2RI at these sites. Disruption of cellular tension leads to a collapse of this spatial organization and drives formation of heteromeric T\u03b2RI/T\u03b2RII complexes and Smad activation. This work details a novel mechanism by which cellular tension regulates TGF\u03b2 receptor organization, multimerization, and function, providing new insight into the mechanisms that integrate biochemical and physical cues."
