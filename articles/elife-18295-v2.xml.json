Even though, there has been no evidence of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in <i>Drosophila</i>, the larval lymph gland with its Hedgehog dependent progenitors served as an invertebrate model of progenitor biology. Employing lineage-tracing analyses, we have now identified <i>Notch</i> expressing HSCs in the first instar larval lymph gland. Our studies clearly establish the hierarchical relationship between <i>Notch</i> expressing HSCs and the previously described <i>Domeless</i> expressing progenitors. These HSCs require Decapentapelagic (Dpp) signal from the hematopoietic niche for their maintenance in an identical manner to vertebrate aorta-gonadal-mesonephros (AGM) HSCs. Thus, this study not only extends the conservation across these divergent taxa, but also provides a new model that can be exploited to gain better insight into the AGM related Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)."
