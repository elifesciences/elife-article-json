Referees ask for too many revisions, and editors let them get away with it. Authors are obsessed with impact factors, and the peer review process\u2014the process that is meant to keep standards high\u2014seems close to breaking point. A letter published in <i>Science</i> in 2008 said it all: \u2018The stress associated with publishing experimental results\u2014a process that can take as long as obtaining the results in the first place\u2014can drain much of the joy from practicing science\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Raff et al., 2008</a>). <i>eLife</i> was set up to address many of these issues and now, one year after we published our first papers, is a good time to reflect on the progress we have made."

The review process at any journal begins with editors who initially assess the work. Compared to academic editors, professional editors have fewer distractions, but they also often lack the in-depth knowledge that is needed to properly assess many of the manuscripts that they handle. This has four major drawbacks. First, simply deciding whether a manuscript should be sent to external referees for in-depth peer review can take weeks. Second, after all the referee reports have been received, they are often passed on to the author with relatively little guidance from the editor on how the manuscript needs to be revised to maximize its chances of acceptance. Third, revised manuscripts are automatically sent back to the referees in many cases, regardless of whether or not the referees have indicated that they are willing to take part in a second round of review. Finally, it is not unusual for more than one round of revision to be required: this means that the process can drag on for months and months, with no guarantee that the manuscript will be accepted (<a href=\"#bib4\">Snyder, 2013</a>). In the meantime, publication of similar results by other authors, often in journals with less strict standards, may lead to rejection of the original manuscript, despite all the efforts made by the original authors to address the criticisms levelled by the referees."

Each manuscript submitted to the journal is assigned to a Senior Editor who decides\u2014often after consultation with one or more members of the Board of Reviewing Editors\u2014whether or not it merits in-depth peer review. On average, we tell authors within just three days whether we are interested in sending their manuscript to referees for detailed review. With 20 leading researchers working as <a href=\"http://elife.elifesciences.org/editorial-leadership\">Senior Editors</a>, and another 170 serving as <a href=\"http://elife.elifesciences.org/reviewing-editors\">Reviewing Editors</a>, <i>eLife</i> has access to expertise in almost every area of the life sciences, from systems neurobiology and structural biology to medical genetics and ecological genomics."

After all the referee reports have been received, the Reviewing Editor, with support from a Senior Editor, oversees an online discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the manuscript under review. This happens in a blog-like format on a secure website where the referees are identified to each other and communicate as peers over the course of a day or more; in some cases there have been more than 30 discussion comments! This open process ensures that a referee will be held accountable in a discussion with known colleagues. If the consensus is that the work should be published in <i>eLife</i>, the main points of the referee reports are distilled into a single decision letter that clearly spells out what additional analysis, if any, is required before the manuscript can be accepted: in general we only ask for essential revisions that will not unduly delay publication. Even with this additional back-and-forth between the referees, on average it takes only 28 days to return a decision to the authors. However, the real benefits of this extra work are seen at the next stage of the process: most manuscripts that are accepted have undergone just one round of revision, with the process of revision and re-evaluation taking an average of just six weeks. All these figures are on our <a href=\"http://elife.elifesciences.org/review-process\">website</a>."

This is complemented by <a href=\"http://lens.elifesciences.org/\">eLife Lens</a>, a new way of dynamically displaying scientific articles online, instead of merely replicating the print version (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Based on ideas developed by Ivan Grubisic, a graduate student at UC Berkeley, <i>eLife Lens</i> allows readers to move between the text, figures and references in a way that is more intuitive and flexible than existing approaches to online journals. We have also dispensed with the artificial separation between Printed figures and supplementary figures, and are pleased that we are no longer alone with these efforts."

The acceptance rates of many other journals, on the other hand, still seem to be influenced by page budgets that date back to the print era: such page budgets are an artificially restricted commodity in the age of electronic publication. This problem is particularly acute at some of the most highly competitive print journals. Submitting manuscripts to these journals can be likened to applying for a job at Google: because so many excellent candidates apply, Google does not worry about how many of these excellent candidates are rejected. Its main concern is that everyone who makes it through the interview process should fit the Google mould. Scientific journals should not work in this way, with only a limited number of vacancies. At <i>eLife</i> we aim to publish work of a certain standard, and we accept all manuscripts that reach or exceed this standard. Taking the Google approach, on the other hand, inevitably leads to too many excellent papers being rejected by the most selective journals. Related to this we helped to draft the <a href=\"http://am.ascb.org/dora/\">San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment</a> because we feel strongly that research needs to be assessed on its own merits, not on where it was published (<a href=\"#bib5\">Vale, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Vosshall, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Schekman and Patterson, 2013</a>)."

In the first twelve months, we have already published more than 180 research articles on a wide range of subjects, from the <a href=\"http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/1/e00013\">origins of multicellularity</a> in animals (which was literally our first paper) and <a href=\"http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/2/e00669\">plants performing arithmetic</a> so that they do not run out of starch by morning, to the <a href=\"http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/2/e00747\">evolution of cancer</a> after targeted combination therapy and the discovery of the <a href=\"http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/1/e00049\">Hepatitis B receptor</a>. Notably, from the very beginning, the average quality of submissions has been very high, with only a small minority not meriting any discussion at all among the editors."

We were not alone in this view, and were able to recruit a fantastic team of editors. Our combined efforts are being richly rewarded by the great manuscripts that researchers are submitting to <i>eLife</i> and by the enthusiastic feedback we are receiving from authors, referees and readers. Our publishing activities are only the beginning of a great journey: please join us in making <i>eLife</i> a journal that is truly designed for science at its very best."
