Here we show the clinical significance and metastatic mechanism of NIFK in lung cancer. NIFK expression is clinically associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Furthermore, NIFK enhances Ki-67-dependent proliferation, and promotes migration, invasion <i>in vitro</i> and metastasis <i>in vivo</i> via downregulation of casein kinase 1\u03b1 (CK1\u03b1), a suppressor of pro-metastatic TCF4/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Inversely, CK1\u03b1 is upregulated upon NIFK knockdown. The silencing of CK1\u03b1 expression in NIFK-silenced cells restores TCF4/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity, cell migration, and metastasis. Furthermore, RUNX1 is identified as a transcription factor of <i>CSNK1A1</i> (CK1\u03b1) that is negatively regulated by NIFK. Our results demonstrate the prognostic value of NIFK, and suggest that NIFK is required for lung cancer progression via the RUNX1-dependent CK1\u03b1 repression, which activates TCF4/\u03b2-catenin signaling in metastasis and the Ki-67-dependent regulation in cell proliferation."

Here we show the clinical significance and metastatic mechanism of NIFK in lung cancer. NIFK expression is clinically associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Furthermore, NIFK enhances Ki-67-dependent proliferation, and promotes migration, invasion <i>in vitro</i> and metastasis <i>in vivo</i> via downregulation of casein kinase 1\u03b1 (CK1\u03b1), a suppressor of pro-metastatic TCF4/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Inversely, CK1\u03b1 is upregulated upon NIFK knockdown. The silencing of CK1\u03b1 expression in NIFK-silenced cells restores TCF4/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity, cell migration, and metastasis. Furthermore, RUNX1 is identified as a transcription factor of <i>CSNK1A1</i> (CK1\u03b1) that is negatively regulated by NIFK. Our results demonstrate the prognostic value of NIFK, and suggest that NIFK is required for lung cancer progression via the RUNX1-dependent CK1\u03b1 repression, which activates TCF4/\u03b2-catenin signaling in metastasis and the Ki-67-dependent regulation in cell proliferation."

Since its discovery as an antigen for a monoclonal antibody against a Hodgkin lymphoma cell line more than 30 years ago (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gerdes et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gerdes et al., 1984</a>), Ki-67 serves as the most useful biomarker of cancer in clinical practice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown and Gatter, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yerushalmi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Martin et al., 2004</a>). The finding that Ki-67 is exclusively expressed in the nucleus during all active cell cycle phases (G1, S, G2, and mitosis) in actively proliferating cells but not in quiescent cells renders it a reliable marker for proliferation fraction assessment (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gerdes et al., 1984</a>). In many cancer types including breast (<a href=\"#bib28\">Luporsi et al., 2012</a>), lung (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jakobsen and Sorensen, 2013</a>), brain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abry et al., 2010</a>), and prostate cancer (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fisher et al., 2013</a>), the Ki-67 expression level represents a proliferation index, and Ki-67 overexpression predicts poor prognosis. Moreover, Ki-67 has also been used to determine cancer treatment strategies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dowsett et al., 2011</a>). Ki-67 silencing was recently reported to elicit the disappearance of perichromosomal layers in mitosis and the smaller nuclei of daughter cells leading to the problem in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Booth et al., 2014</a>). However, although Ki-67 is known to play an important role in cell proliferation, the mechanism by which Ki-67 regulates cancer progression remains unclear."

NIFK binds to the FHA domain of Ki-67 by two key regulators of mitosis: cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and glycogen synthase kinase GSK-3 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Byeon et al., 2005</a>), and the NIFK sequential phosphorylation at Thr238 and Thr234 is required for the Ki-67 interaction (<a href=\"#bib5\">Byeon et al., 2005</a>). During mitosis, both NIFK and Ki-67 are recruited to the chromosome periphery, and the localization of NIFK at the peripheral of mitotic chromosome is disrupted in the absence of Ki-67 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Booth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Van Hooser et al., 2005</a>). This critical role of the NIFK-Ki-67 interaction in regulating mitosis renders NIFK as a promising target of cancer research. However, to date, studies focused on the importance of NIFK in cancer are lacking, and no clear evidence has emerged to elucidate whether and how NIFK regulates cancer progression."

Stabilization and nuclear import of \u03b2-catenin activates downstream transcriptional targets, <i>MMP7, MYC, TCF4, CCND1</i> and <i>CD44</i> which are related to cell cycle, differentiation and metastasis regulation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schwartz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cho et al., 2011</a>). \u03b2-catenin is constantly synthesized but is normally controlled at restricted low concentration by proteasome-mediated degradation. Degradation of \u03b2-catenin is shown to be regulated via sequential phosphorylation by casein kinase 1\u03b1 (CK1\u03b1) first, and then by GSK-3, which facilitates the\u00a0formation of the destruction complex (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2012</a>). CK1 family members including CK1\u03b1 are constitutively active in cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Price MA, 2006</a>). Therefore, CK1\u03b1 function is determined by its intracellular level.

We focused our study on lung cancer due to the strongest prognostic value of NIFK for lung cancer. Surprisingly, our results revealed NIFK significantly promotes cancer migration and invasion <i>in vitro</i> and tumor metastasis <i>in vivo</i> in addition to its ability to regulate cancer proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NIFK modulates lung cancer metastasis by regulating TCF4/\u03b2-catenin signaling via the alternation of Casein kinase 1\u03b1 (CK1\u03b1) expression. Our study indicates that NIFK expression promotes cancer metastasis and proliferation leading to poor clinical outcomes; thus, NIFK may represent a prognostic indicator and a promising therapeutic target for lung cancer patients."

A significantly positive correlation between <i>MKI67IP</i> (NIFK) and <i>MKI67</i> (Ki-67) was observed in almost all cancer types (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). High <i>MKI67IP</i> expression was observed in lung, colorectal, breast, uterine, bladder, head and neck, melanoma, cervical, and ovarian cancer. In these high <i>MKI67IP</i>-expressing cancer types, the most significant positive correlation between <i>MKI67IP</i> and <i>MKI67</i> expression was detected in lung cancer (\u03c1 = 0.488, p&lt;0.001). Based on the heat map, we also observed that the normal tissue group tended to display low <i>MKI67IP</i> expression. IHC analysis revealed significantly higher expression of NIFK in the samples from our patient cohort than in the paired normal tissue for lung and colorectal cancer but not breast cancer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To identify the cancer types in which NIFK exerts the most significant impact on cancer progression, we examined the prognostic value of NIFK for various cancer types using the PrognoScan database. High <i>MKI67IP</i> expression was associated with poor survival in several cancer types, including lung, breast, and blood cancer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). By ranking the hazard ratios from the Cox proportional hazards survival model, we determined that high <i>MKI67IP</i> expression corresponded to the highest hazard ratio in lung cancer patients (hazard ratio = 4.71, Cox p value = 0.000308). Based on clinicopathological analysis of lung cancer, the patients displaying high NIFK protein expression exhibited more frequent nodal involvement (p = 0.032) and distant metastasis (p = 0.036), as well as a higher pathological stage (p = 0.059) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Similar results were observed in a lung cancer cohort from the TCGA database (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). According to the above results, NIFK displayed the greatest clinical significance for lung cancer and may be associated with lung cancer progression by regulating tumor metastasis."

The NIFK-regulated cell proliferation was Ki-67-dependent that Ki-67 silencing decreased cell growth in both A549 and PC13 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In addition, the effect of NIFK Ki-FHA binding, RNA recognition motif (RRM) truncation and T234A/T238A point mutation on cell proliferation was compared with ectopic expression of wild type (WT) NIFK (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013F</a>). Based on <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, both RRM and Ki-FHA binding domain were involved in tumor proliferation, but the latter was more significant. In lung cancer cohort, we observed positive correlation of high NIFK/Ki-67 with poor survival at protein level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, p\u00a0= 0.004) and significant expression coefficient (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, p&lt;0.001).

                                "text": "The importance of NIFK in clinical patients motivated us to explore the molecular mechanism underlying NIFK-mediated lung cancer metastasis. Knocking down Ki-67 expression by shRNA1 in NIFK-overexpressing PC13 cells and H1299 cells did not impact NIFK-induced cell migration or invasion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). Therefore, we performed microarray analysis of PC13 cells overexpressing NIFK. The signature of genes displaying a\u22651.5-fold change in expression upon NIFK overexpression was subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and MetaCore database analysis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Based on the MetaCore enrichment analysis, Wnt signaling, a previously identified pivotal pathway in regulating cancer metastasis was most strongly affected by NIFK overexpression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>). The levels of CK1\u03b1 and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-AXIN-CK1\u03b1-CTNN\u03b2-GSK3\u03b2 complex were decreased following NIFK overexpression, indicating that CK1\u03b1 is a key molecule in the NIFK-regulated Wnt signaling pathway (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Based on these bioinformatics results, we hypothesized that NIFK overexpression downregulates CK1\u03b1, thereby decreasing the levels of the APC-AXIN-CK1\u03b1-CTNN\u03b2-GSK3\u03b2 complex, which in turn increases intracellular \u03b2-catenin protein stability. The increased nuclear fraction of \u03b2-catenin was observed upon NIFK overexpression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>) as well as the reduced \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, we determined whether TCF/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity is affected by the NIFK/CK1\u03b1 axis. The results of TCF/\u03b2-catenin reporter assay revealed the decreased luciferase activity in the NIFK-silenced cells. Additional knockdown of CK1\u03b1 restored TCF/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity in both NIFK-silenced H661 and H1299 cells (p&lt;0.01, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). In addition, the downstream transcriptional targets of TCF/\u03b2-catenin, including <i>TCF4, CD44, CCND1</i> and <i>MMP7</i>, were regulated by the NIFK-CK1\u03b1 axis (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The upregulated downstream transcriptional targets were further confirmed by another microarray analysis of PC13 cells with lentiviral-based stable NIFK overexpression (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>, labeled in red). These data indicated that NIFK might regulate TCF/\u03b2-catenin-mediated transcriptional events via CK1\u03b1."

                                "text": "Knocking down NIFK expression elicited CK1\u03b1 upregulation, which decreased the downstream inhibitory target \u03b2-catenin in the H661 and H1299 cell lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, Left). In addition, NIFK overexpression using a lentivirus decreased CK1\u03b1 expression and increased \u03b2-catenin level in A549 and PC13 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, Right). A similar result was observed following transient overexpression of NIFK (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To investigate the potential mechanism underlying the NIFK-mediated regulation of <i>CSNK1A1</i> (CK1\u03b1) transcription, we performed a search using the TFSEARCH website to identify putative transcription factors that may bind to the promoter. Several potential transcription factors were identified according to the matched consensus binding sequences of each candidate transcription factor to the <i>CSNK1A1</i> (Ensembl:ENSG00000113712) promoter region (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). RUNX1 and SRY scored 100 with respect to the matched sequences. The promoter region from -969 to -127 bp was found to be important for transcriptional activation, indicating the potential involvement of SRY and RUNX1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Thus, we determined the involvement of these transcription factors in regulating the expression level of CK1\u03b1. Silencing of RUNX1 and SRY expression in H1299 cells using shRNA decreased the CK1\u03b1 expression levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), whereas no change in CK1\u03b1 expression was detected following knockdown of another putative transcription factor, CdxA (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, The ChIP assay was performed on NS H1299 cells and the NIFK-silenced H1299 cell clone sh6 to explore whether the binding of the predicted transcription factors to the promoter region is regulated by NIFK. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, increased promoter binding of RUNX1 was observed in the NIFK-silenced H1299 cell clone sh6 compared with the NS control clone (Top panel). In a complementary experiment, the overexpression of NIFK in PC13 cells decreased the promoter binding of RUNX1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, Bottom panel). However, this regulation was not significantly observed for SRY based on the ChIP experiment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Thus, we ruled out the involvement of SRY in the NIFK/CK1\u03b1 axis. To further determine whether RUNX1 affects CK1 promoter activity, we performed the reporter assay. Our results revealed increased CK1 reporter activity after NIFK knockdown in H1299 cells, which was decreased by RUNX1 knockdown (p&lt;0.001, Left, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). In addition, the relative luciferase activity was dose-dependently decreased by NIFK overexpression in PC13 cells (p&lt;0.001, Right, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Furthermore, <i>RUNX1</i> mRNA level was found to be destabilized upon NIFK overexpression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and the promoter activity was decreased by NIFK (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Inversely, RUNX1 was increased upon NIFK silencing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). In addition, the NIFK-mediated RUNX1 repression might be relevant to its FHA and RRM domain (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). However, the binding of NIFK with <i>RUNX1</i> mRNA and with RUNX1 protein were not detected (RNA binding protein IP and protein IP data not shown). Therefore, the mechanism needs further to be investigated. In the lung cancer cohort, the NIFK and RUNX1 or CK1\u03b1 RNA levels were inversely correlated, whereas the RUNX1 and CK1\u03b1 RNA expression levels were positively correlated (p&lt;0.001, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). These results suggested that RUNX1 is a potential transcriptional factor of <i>CSNK1A1</i> (CK1\u03b1) that is negatively regulated by NIFK to decrease CK1\u03b1 expression."

CK1\u03b1 expression was reduced in H661 and H1299 cells via lentivirus-based shRNA-mediated knockdown in conjunction with NIFK silencing using sh6 to determine the functional role of CK1\u03b1 (CK1\u03b1 sh1-3, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Knocking down CK1\u03b1 expression restored cell migration compared with the NIFK knockdown-only group, although the effects on clones sh1 and sh2 were clearer than those on clone sh3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggested that the effect of NIFK on cell migration may be regulated by CK1\u03b1. Next, we performed animal experiments to examine whether CK1\u03b1 is involved in NIFK-regulated tumor metastasis. The formation of surface lung nodules was significantly restored due to CK1\u03b1 knockdown in the H661 and H1299 sh6 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>, upper left). This restoration of tumor metastasis was further confirmed via HE staining of the lung tissue (Lower left, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>). The quantifications for the number of metastatic lung nodules in each group are presented (Right, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>).

In support of this hypothesis, we observed that high levels of CK1\u03b1 correlated with a favorable prognosis in lung cancer patients (p = 0.051) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Furthermore, the combination of NIFK (<i>MKI67IP</i>) and CK1\u03b1 (<i>CSNK1A1</i>) may represent a superior prognostic indicator for lung cancer (p = 0.01) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a> represents the model that NIFK promotes lung cancer progression by (1) downregulating CK1\u03b1 expression through the destabilization of its novel transcription factor, RUNX1, to promote lung cancer metastasis as well as (2) increasing the Ki-67-dependent cell proliferation."

Lung cancer patients displaying high NIFK expression exhibited poor prognosis and frequent lymph node and distant metastasis. Although Ki-67 has been a research emphasis of cancer, Ki-67-interacting proteins have not been given the attention that they merit and are generally considered to regulate cancer proliferation via their physiological roles in mitosis and the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib3\">Booth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Byeon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Florian and Mayer, 2011</a>). Hklp2/KIF15, another Ki-67 interacting protein, plays a critical role in the maintenance of spindle bipolarity during cell division and was reported to serve as a breast cancer tumor antigen (<a href=\"#bib15\">Florian and Mayer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rath and Kozielski, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Scanlan et al., 2001</a>). NIFK was previously implicated as a c-Myc-responsive gene in breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib32\">Musgrove et al., 2008</a>). The significant cancer metastasis-promoting characteristics of NIFK demonstrated by our results provide novel insight into the role of NIFK in cancer. Furthermore, aside from its role as a proliferation marker, Ki-67 has been demonstrated to be associated with metastasis and lymphovascular invasion in cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pollack et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Inwald et al., 2013</a>).

Ki-67 was reported as a key factor organizing chromosomal periphery during cell mitosis, and silence of Ki-67 might elicit cell death (<a href=\"#bib3\">Booth et al., 2014</a>). NIFK interacts with Ki-67 in mitotic phase, and whether the interaction is critical in nuclear organization remains to be explored. Our previous study characterized the role of NIFK in U2OS cell proliferation as well as the requirement of its RRM for rRNA maturation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pan et al., 2015</a>). However, Ki-67 interacting motif of NIFK also plays a role in regulating cell proliferation especially after long-term incubation as compared with the immediate response of RRM deletion in U2OS cell (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pan et al., 2015</a>). Both results evidently point on NIFK as a gatekeeper in the maintenance of well-regulated cell cycle. The discrepancy of RRM efficacy in proliferation among two studies might potentially due to the difference in cell type-specific mechanism."

In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, the level of intracellular \u03b2-catenin is modulated by proteasomal degradation mediated by destruction complex, which is composed of APC, Axin, CK1\u03b1, and GSK3\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib29\">MacDonald et al., 2009</a>). Given that \u03b2-catenin and APC mutation is less commonly observed in lung cancer than in other cancer types such as colon cancer, understanding the mechanism by which these Wnt signaling inhibitors regulate the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex is crucial (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stewart, 2014</a>). Many studies have demonstrated that the downregulation of the members of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex, including CK1\u03b1, is commonly observed in lung cancer cell lines and cancer tissue and correlates with poor prognosis or poor clinicopathological characteristics (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Srivastava et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). In our study, we found that NIFK acts as a critical regulator that prevents CK1\u03b1-mediated \u03b2-catenin degradation, which in turn leads to cancer metastasis.

Recently, a negative feedback loop of Wnt signaling activation was reported via the Huwe-1-dependent ubiquitylation of Dishevelled (Dvl) (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Groot et al., 2014</a>). Upon Wnt signaling activation, Dvl recruits Axin and GSK3-\u03b2 away from the destruction complex, thereby inhibiting \u03b2-catenin destruction complex formation and, subsequently, \u03b2-catenin degradation (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Groot et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stambolic et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Behrens et al., 1998</a>). Correspondingly, we detected significant Huwe-1 upregulation based on the microarray data of NIFK overexpression, suggesting the activation of an alternative negative feedback loop via the decrease in Dvl activity (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Although this negative feedback might serve to regulate lung cancer progression via GSK-3\u03b2, CK1\u03b1, as the downstream rate-determining enzyme that sequentially phosphorylates \u03b2-catenin prior to GSK3\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>), remains to play a significant role in NIFK regulated \u03b2-catenin degradation."

These results implicated the critical role of the NIFK-CK1\u03b1-\u03b2-catenin pathway in p53-deficient lung cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated that CK1\u03b1 plays a role as a tumor suppressor in p53-inactivated cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Elyada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huart et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2005</a>). The loss of heterozygosity of CK1\u03b1 results in highly invasive carcinoma in a p53-deficient mouse model (<a href=\"#bib12\">Elyada et al., 2011</a>). Because p53 inactivation is a major pathogenic event in lung cancer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Herbst et al., 2008</a>), further research is necessary to determine the role of NIFK-mediated CK1\u03b1 expression in p53-deficient lung cancer."

The loss of RUNX1 from intestinal epithelial cells significantly induced tumorigenesis in a conditional knockout mouse model (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fijneman et al., 2012</a>), and the knockdown of RUNX1 in breast cancer cells resulted in hyperproliferation and abnormal morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Janes, 2011</a>).
