The recent discovery of prevalent ESR1 mutations in relapsed tumors underscores a sustained reliance of advanced tumors on ER\u03b1 signaling, and provides a strong rationale for continued targeting of ER\u03b1. Here we describe GDC-0810, a novel, non-steroidal, orally bioavailable selective ER downregulator (SERD), which was identified by prospectively optimizing ER\u03b1 degradation, antagonism and pharmacokinetic properties. GDC-0810 induces a distinct ER\u03b1 conformation, relative to that induced by currently approved therapeutics, suggesting a unique mechanism of action. GDC-0810 has robust in vitro and in vivo activity against a variety of human breast cancer cell lines and patient derived xenografts, including a tamoxifen-resistant model and those that harbor ER\u03b1 mutations. GDC-0810 is currently being evaluated in Phase II clinical studies in women with ER+ breast cancer."

The recent discovery of prevalent ESR1 mutations in relapsed tumors underscores a sustained reliance of advanced tumors on ER\u03b1 signaling, and provides a strong rationale for continued targeting of ER\u03b1. Here we describe GDC-0810, a novel, non-steroidal, orally bioavailable selective ER downregulator (SERD), which was identified by prospectively optimizing ER\u03b1 degradation, antagonism and pharmacokinetic properties. GDC-0810 induces a distinct ER\u03b1 conformation, relative to that induced by currently approved therapeutics, suggesting a unique mechanism of action. GDC-0810 has robust in vitro and in vivo activity against a variety of human breast cancer cell lines and patient derived xenografts, including a tamoxifen-resistant model and those that harbor ER\u03b1 mutations. GDC-0810 is currently being evaluated in Phase II clinical studies in women with ER+ breast cancer."

About 75% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), a hormone-regulated transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dunnwald et al., 2007</a>). ER\u03b1-positive breast cancers typically respond well to therapy that attenuates ER\u03b1\u00a0signaling, either by blocking the production of estrogens via aromatase inhibitors, or antagonizing the activity of estrogens through competitive binding of ER antagonists such as tamoxifen (<a href=\"#bib39\">Puhalla et al., 2012</a>). While estrogen disrupting therapies are often effective both in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, patients frequently relapse after prolonged therapy (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dowsett et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Davies et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mauri et al., 2006</a>)."

ER signaling re-activation in the relapsed setting can occur due to changes in ligand sensitivity and specificity, for example, resistance to tamoxifen has been proposed to be a result of the selection of tumor cells that recognize the ER:tamoxifen complex as agonistic (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gottardis and Jordan, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">McDonnell and Wardell, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Takimoto et al., 1999</a>). More recently however, a series of mutations in the ligand binding domain of ER\u03b1 have been found at a high prevalence (25\u201340%) in relapsed, metastatic patients, though are very rare in untreated populations (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jeselsohn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Merenbakh-Lamin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Robinson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Toy et al., 2013</a>). These mutations have been shown in overexpression experiments to confer estrogen-independent activity to the receptor, and to reduce the potency of, for example, tamoxifen. The continued dependence of breast cancer tumors on ER\u03b1 provides a strong rationale to continue to target ER in both first line and relapsed/advanced settings."

                        "text": "Selective ER Downregulators (SERDs) are competitive ER\u03b1 antagonists that also induce a conformational shift of the receptor that results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ER\u03b1, via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<a href=\"#bib1\">Berry et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wijayaratne and McDonnell, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wijayaratne et al., 1999</a>). The unique dual-function of SERDs (ER antagonism and depletion) may enable them to block ER signaling in cellular settings where other endocrine agents, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors have failed. Indeed, the clinical impact of fulvestrant as a treatment of recurrent, endocrine resistant disease, supports this notion (<a href=\"#bib37\">Perey et al., 2007</a>).Though fulvestrant has served as an important proof of concept for the SERD approach [see also (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ellis et al., 2015</a>)], it is limited by its poor pharmaceutical properties, which necessitates administration by intramuscular injection and limits the applied dose, exposure, and receptor engagement (<a href=\"#bib40\">Robertson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">van Kruchten et al., 2015</a>). The fulvestrant 500 mg regimen (500 mg on day 1, 14, 28; monthly thereafter) exhibited improvement in progression free survival and overall survival over the initially approved and marketed 250 mg regimen (<a href=\"#bib7\">Di Leo et al., 2010</a>). The 500 mg regimen achieves higher plasma concentrations and a more rapid ascent to steady-state drug levels, which in turn is thought to result in superior modulation of ER signaling (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kuter et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ohno et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pritchard et al., 2010</a>). However, the 500\u00a0mg dose does not fully saturate ER binding in patients, as inhibition of [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroestradiol uptake was incomplete in 38% (6/16) of patients analyzed. Importantly, this lack of receptor occupancy was associated with lack of clinical benefit (<a href=\"#bib46\">van Kruchten et al., 2015</a>). Together, these data demonstrate that SERDs have the potential to provide effective and well-tolerated therapy for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, and highlight the need for the development of SERDs with optimized bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. Here we describe a novel, potent non-steroidal ER antagonist and degrader, GDC-0810, that is orally bioavailable and has strong anti-tumor activity in endocrine-sensitive and -resistant models of ER+ breast cancer."

These efforts resulted in the identification of an indazole series of SERDs, including GDC-0810 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Compounds were assessed for their ability to modulate ER\u03b1 protein levels in MCF7 breast cancer cells using a quantitative In-Cell Western (ICW) immunofluorescence assay, which enabled determination of compound potency and maximal activity in a high throughput format. GDC-0810 was prioritized for further characterization based on its ability to robustly reduce cellular ER\u03b1 levels within 4\u2009hr, to levels approaching that observed with fulvestrant, with sub-nanomolar potency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The active metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OH-tamoxifen), exhibited some activity in this assay, though it failed to reduce ER\u03b1 signal to the level achieved by fulvestrant or GDC-0810. The ability of GDC-0810 to reduce steady-state levels of ER\u03b1 was confirmed using a Western Blot assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We further demonstrated that GDC-0810-mediated ER\u03b1 depletion is dependent on the 26S proteasome, since addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, fully blocked GDC-0810 depletion of ER\u03b1, similar to the effect of MG132 treatment in preventing fulvestrant-mediated ER turnover (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>)."

To assess the ER\u03b1 conformation induced by GDC-0810 relative to other SERMs and SERDs, we utilized a mammalian 2-hybrid based peptide interaction assay. This assay, run in the presence of saturating concentrations of ER ligands, differentiates ligand-induced ER conformations based on the ability of the ligand-bound receptor to interact with discriminatory peptide probes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iannone et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Norris et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Paige et al., 1999</a>). We included in our analysis fulvestrant, 4OH-tamoxifen, a number of additional clinically approved ER ligands, such as bazedoxifene, and also GW7604. GW7604 is an active metabolite of GW5638, an ER ligand that entered Phase I clinical trials for breast cancer, but is not currently in further clinical development. Like GDC-0810, GW5638 is a non-steroidal dual function ER antagonist and degrader (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lai et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Willson et al., 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">1997</a>). The GDC-0810:ER complex recruits a distinct set of peptides relative to the other ER:ligand complexes profiled here, with the exception of GW7604 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lai et al., 2015</a>). GDC-0810 thus induces an ER conformational profile that is different from that induced by 4OH-tamoxifen, fulvestrant and other marketed SERMs and similar to GW7604 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Since the biological activity of ER\u03b1 is determined by the conformation of the receptor and its ability to interact with other regulatory proteins, this result implies differences in the response of ER\u03b1 to GDC-0810 and the clinically approved ER\u03b1 therapeutics."

Though 4OH-tamoxifen primarily antagonizes estrogen-dependent ER signaling in breast cancer cells, its partial agonistic activity has been revealed through gene expression profiling in the absence of estrogen, in MCF7 cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wardell et al., 2013</a>). To assess the potential agonistic activity of GDC-0810 we evaluated the consequence of GDC-0810 treatment on a previously described SERM discriminatory gene set, likewise, in the absence of estrogen in MCF7 cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wardell et al., 2013</a>). In line with earlier observations, 4OH-tamoxifen induces a strong up-regulation of a gene set that includes the estrogen-responsive genes, <i>AGR2</i> and <i>RASGRP</i>, while fulvestrant fails to do so (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). GDC-0810 most closely resembled fulvestrant and GW7604 in this analysis, displaying little of the transcriptional agonist activity observed with the SERMs 4OH-tamoxifen, lasofoxifene, arzoxifene or endoxifene and often demonstrating inverse agonist activity on estradiol responsive genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These findings are consistent with ER-ChIP analysis demonstrating that GDC-0810 treatment, similar to fulvestrant, can reduce the levels\u00a0of ER\u03b1 associated with chromatin on ER\u03b1 target genes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This was demonstrated using an experimental system whereby ER was over-expressed in an attempt to saturate the degradation machinery, enabling an uncoupling of ER degradation from ER antagonism. Likewise, we sought to determine if GDC-0810 can inhibit ER signaling in the absence ER degradation, using a similar strategy (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wardell et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2013</a>). Over-expression of ER in doxycycline-inducible MCF7 cells resulted in the induction of the ER target gene, PR, consistent with ligand-independent activation of the pathway. Treating these cells with fulvestrant resulted in both depletion of ER, as well as suppression of PR. In the case of GDC-0810 treatment, PR was likewise suppressed, though ER levels remained high (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Cell viability assays demonstrated that both fulvestrant and GDC-0810 suppress proliferation of MCF7 cells over-expressing ER, with EC50s and IC50s similar to cells expressing endogenous levels of ER, despite the retention of high ER levels in the over-expressing cells treated with GDC-0810 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). These data imply that GDC-0810 has the ability to antagonize ER function independent from its degradation activity, consistent with the demonstration that GDC-0810 displaces the co-activator PGC1\u03b1 in cell free biochemical assays, in which ER degradation does not occur (see below, Figure 6A)."

In line with previous reports, 4OH-tamoxifen robustly increases alkaline phosphatase activity, while fulvestrant shows no such effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). GDC-0810 modestly increases alkaline phosphatase activity, though plateaus at low concentrations, below the level stimulated by 4OH-tamoxifen (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To follow up on this observation we next assessed the consequences of GDC-0810 administration on the uterus of juvenile rats. Tamoxifen at 60 mg/kg, dosed orally, once a day for 3 days, increases uterine wet weight, though not to the extent driven by the administration of 0.1 mg/kg 17\u03b1 estradiol over the same time period (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In contrast, Fulvestrant at 50 mg/kg acts as an inverse agonist, resulting in a significant decrease in uterine weight relative to the control group. GDC-0810 dosed at 0.1 or 10 mg/kg did not significantly alter uterine wet relative to the vehicle control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Importantly though, histological analysis and quantification of endometrial cell height showed that, like estradiol and tamoxifen, GDC-0810 induced a cuboidal to columnar morphological change in the epithelial cells, while the epithelia from fulvestrant-treated animals remained cuboidal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). In line with the observed morphological changes to the endometrial epithelium, gene expression analysis demonstrated that GDC-0810 induces ER target genes, including C3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These in vivo phenotypes were observed at a GDC-0810 dose of 0.1 mg/kg and were not significantly different at the 10 mg/kg dose, suggesting saturation of the effect at low doses. Together, these data demonstrate that GDC-0810 mildly stimulates ER signaling in the uterus, similar to the recently described SERD AZD9496 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Weir et al., 2016</a>). Intriguingly, IHC analysis of ER in the uterus showed that GDC-0810 only modestly reduces ER levels in this context, similar to estradiol, while fulvestrant robustly depletes ER."

To determine the ability of GDC-0810 to inhibit E2 stimulated tumor growth in vivo, we treated MCF7 tumor bearing nu/nu mice orthotopically implanted with 0.36 mg/60 day release E2 pellets (Innovative Research) with GDC-0810, ranging from 1 to 100 mg/kg/day p.o. Fulvestrant was delivered by sub-cutaneous injection, with an initial loading dose of 50 mg/kg on days 1, 3 and 8, and subsequent dosing of 25 mg/kg twice per week to achieve exposures similar to those achieved in the clinic. In the MCF7 xenograft model, GDC-0810 displayed dose dependent efficacy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The 100 mg/kg/day dose caused tumor regressions; an effect similar to withdrawal of estrogen pellets at the start of dosing. In contrast, fulvestrant, at a clinically relevant dose as well as at a considerably higher dose (200 mg/kg, 3 times per week), yielded only modest tumor growth inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). It is important to note that the restriction of the fulvestrant response to tumor growth inhibition, rather than stasis or tumor regression, was not a function of low exposure, as the plasma concentrations at the 200 mg/kg dose were on average 12\u201314 \u00b5g*hr/mL, approximately 30-fold above the clinical exposure of the fulvestrant 500 mg clinical regimen (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ohno et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pritchard et al., 2010</a>).

Indeed, the gene expression changes induced by GDC-0810 are similar to, and in some cases even more pronounced than, those induced by withdrawal of the estrogen pellet at the beginning of the study, highlighting that GDC-0810 actively and efficiently attenuates ER signaling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

To determine the ability of GDC-0810 to effectively bind tumor-localized ER in vivo, FES-PET imaging was performed on mice bearing MCF7 xenograft tumors following a 7-day treatment with GDC-0810. Prior to GDC-0810 administration FES-PET signal was detectable in both the vehicle and pre-treatment groups (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, when assayed after the seventh consecutive oral daily dose, GDC-0810 at 10 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day reduced FES uptake by 45 and 63 percent respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). At study termination on day 9, the GDC-0810 treatment groups displayed a dose dependent decrease in tumor volume and in ER\u03b1 and PR immunohistochemical staining (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). While the difference in reduction of FES uptake between the 10 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day treatment groups did not reach statistical significance, each dose resulted in a statistically lower FES uptake compared to that in vehicle-treated animals. This would suggest that maximal GDC-0810-mediated ER antagonism, as a result of receptor occupancy and/or degradation, is achieved with a dose of \u226510 and \u2264100 mg/kg/day in this model system."

Consistent with other reported xenograft models of tamoxifen resistance, treatment of the TamR1 xenografts with tamoxifen stimulated tumor growth, relative to the E2 pellet harboring vehicle controls [<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, and (<a href=\"#bib4\">Connor et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gottardis and Jordan, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lai et al., 2015</a>)]. Our earlier work showed that treatment with GDC-0810 p.o. at 100\u00a0mg/kg/day induced tumor regressions in this model, while fulvestrant SC at 200 mg/kg (3x/week) exhibited only modest tumor growth inhibition (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lai et al., 2015</a>). These experiments were conducted in mice with relatively high levels of circulating estradiol, with estradiol being delivered via 0.72 mg 60 day release E2 pellets that are reported by the manufacturer (Innovative Research) to deliver between 300 and 400 pg/ml estradiol. Under these conditions the high E2 reduces the steady state ER\u03b1 protein levels, thus confounding the readout of ER\u03b1 protein as a pharmacodynamic endpoint (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given this limitation of the 'high E2' models, the anti-tumor and pharmacodynamic response to GDC-0810 treatment was evaluated in the TamR1 model grown in mice implanted with pellets designed to release lower concentrations of estradiol (0.18 mg 60 day E2 pellets, reported to deliver 75\u2013100 pg/mL estradiol).

Based on overexpression studies, these mutations have been proposed to confer estrogen-independent activity to ER\u03b1 and are thought to contribute to endocrine resistant disease (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jeselsohn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Merenbakh-Lamin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Robinson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Toy et al., 2013</a>). We focused on the two most commonly occurring mutations, ER.Y537S and ER.D538G, and addressed how these mutations might influence the activity of GDC-0810. In cell-free E2 competitive binding assays, GDC-0810 retains its ability to potently displace E2 from the ligand binding domain, albeit with a slightly increased IC50 (WT: 2.6 nM vs. ER.Y537S: 5.5 nM and ER.D538G: 5.4 nM) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We next determined that GDC-0810 can compete the PGC1\u03b1 co-activator peptide off the mutated ligand binding domain, implying that GDC-0810 is capable of driving an 'active' to 'inactive' conformational shift of mutant ER, though with a ~five\u2013seven fold reduction in biochemical potency compared to wild-type ER (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

Twenty-four clonal lines were generated and their mutant allele frequencies, at the DNA level, were evaluated using mutant-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We selected 7 clones that contained the highest mutant allele frequency for further characterization. These clones were assessed for the expression of the mutant allele using ddPCR on cDNA, in cells grown in either standard media, or hormone-depleted charcoal stripped media. The mutant allele was expressed at ~33% of total mRNA, in all clones examined regardless of growth conditions. One of these clonal lines (clone 6) was selected for subsequent studies (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Despite expressing only 33% mutant RNA, ER.Y537S cells display a high level of estrogen-independent ER pathway activity, as demonstrated by high expression of the ER-target genes, TFF1, GREB1 and PGR, in the absence of estrogen, although these genes can be further stimulated with the addition of estrogen (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We then performed cell viability experiments, assessing the anti-proliferative activity of GDC-0810 in ER.WT and ER.Y537S cells. When the viability assay is conducted in the absence of E2, GDC-0810 displays a marked reduction in potency in the mutant versus wild-type setting, with 22 fold higher concentration being required to achieve 50% maximal inhibition of growth in the ER.Y537S versus ER.WT cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, solid black line vs. solid blue line). In the presence of low E2 concentration (0.1\u00a0nM), this potency shift is less apparent, with only four fold increased compound concentration being required to achieve the same growth inhibition as in the ER.WT cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, dashed black line vs. dashed blue line). The patterns are similar in the case of fulvestrant, with greater potency shifts occurring in the absence of estrogen versus the presence of estrogen (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

Consistent with previous reports, estrogen itself reduces steady-state levels of ER, while simultaneously increasing PR expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, lane 1 vs. lane 7). GDC-0810 reduces steady-state levels of ER protein, in both ER.WT and ER.Y537S cells, demonstrating that the presence of ER.Y537S does not preclude GDC-0810-mediated ER-degradation, though due to a mixed population of ER.WT and ER.Y537S we cannot directly determine if GDC-0810 induced degradation of ER.Y537S is any more or less efficient than that of ER.WT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). The presence of ER.Y537S elevates PR protein levels in the absence of estrogen, consistent with the gene expression data, and this is further induced with the addition of estrogen. The absolute levels of PR achieved in mutant expressing cells are elevated compared to the levels seen in estrogen-treated wild-type ER cells, though this may be a feature of less than saturating/low E2 concentration. GDC-0810 reduces both estrogen-driven, and mutant-driven PR protein levels, athough residual PR is still detected in the mutant cells at 24\u2009hr post compound addition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Like PR, cyclin D1 levels are increased by both estrogen stimulation and by the presence of the ER.Y537S mutation; in both cases treatment with GDC-0810 blocks this increase, with cyclin D1 levels being comparable to un-stimulated cells. In contrast to the robust ER-depletion mediated by GDC-0810 and fulvestrant, tamoxifen does not deplete ER in either ER.WT or ER.Y537S cells, and robustly stabilizes ER in the presence of estrogen, in a dose dependent manner, while simultaneously decreasing levels of PR (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F,H</a>). These data highlight the different consequences of the SERDs versus tamoxifen on ER levels, but demonstrate that GDC-0810, fulvestrant, and 4OH-tamoxifen are all mechanistically, and in principle, capable of suppressing ER signaling driven by the expression of ER.Y537S in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F,H</a>)."

T47D ER.D538G cells, expressing WT:D538G mRNA at a 1:1 ratio (data not shown) express endogenous levels of total ER, though very high levels of PR relative to WT cells, even in the absence of estrogen, implying robust estrogen-independent pathway activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Stimulation with estrogen results in depletion of ER in WT and D538G cells, as expected, though does not further induce PR in the mutant cells. In cell viability assays, GDC-0810 suppresses the proliferation of both ER.WT cells and ER.D538G cells, with modest differences in potency (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We next fluorescently labeled the T47D ER.WT (with RFP) and ER.D538G cells (with GFP) and performed cell-cell competition assays, to further evaluate the conditions under which ER mutant cells have a competitive growth advantage relative to wild-type cells, and the effect of mutant ER\u03b1 on response to GDC-0810. When mixed at a 1:1 ratio at day 0, and grown in the absence of estrogen, ER.D538G cells robustly outcompete ER.WT cells, with WT cells representing only 7.8% (\u00b1 1%) of the total population on day 15 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). In the presence of 0.1 nM estrogen however, much of this competitive advantage is lost, with WT cells representing 40% \u00b1 0.2% of the total population at day 15 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). GDC-0810 attenuates both the estrogen-dependent growth of ER.WT cells, as well as estrogen-independent growth of the ER.D538G cells, though both cell types continue to proliferate at low levels in the presence of drug. In the case of the ER.WT cells, this rate of proliferation is equivalent to cells grown in the absence of estrogen, suggesting that ER-independent mechanisms may support low-level proliferation in these cells. These cell labeling/cell competition experiments further indicate that ER mutant cells do not confer a non-cell autonomous growth signal to ER.WT cells grown in the absence of estrogen, since ER.WT cells grow at the same rate, regardless of whether they are grown alone, or co-cultured with estrogen-independent ER.D538G cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>)."

Therefore, GDC-0810 was tested in a xenograft derived from MCF7 cells overexpressing amino-terminal HA-tagged ER.Y537S (HA-ER.Y537S), which formed rapidly growing tumors in ovariectomized mice without estradiol supplementation. Strikingly, GDC-0810 100 mg/kg/day p.o. induced tumor regressions in the HA-ER.Y537S overexpressing model, while tamoxifen 60 mg/kg/day p.o. and fulvestrant 200\u00a0mg/kg SC (3x/week) resulted in tumor stasis at exposures higher than those achieved in clinic (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>).

A pharmacodynamic (PD) experiment showed that GDC-0810, dosed orally at 100 mg/kg, and fulvestrant dosed intramuscularly at the high dose of 200 mg/kg for 4 days, both modulate a collection of known ER regulated targets, including robust suppression of RASGRP1 and AREG, as examples (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Western blot analysis, quantitative reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and IHC of ER and PR, in the same 4-day PD experiment, demonstrated that GDC-0810 and fulvestrant treatment resulted in modest decreases in ER and PR protein levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). Importantly, in a separate efficacy study, GDC-0810 100 mg/kg/day treatment and tamoxifen 60 mg/kg/day induced tumor stasis, while fulvestrant at at a dose that roughly achieves plasma levels similar to those achieved with the 500-mg dose in humans (50 mg/kg days 1, 3 and 7, 25 mg/kg weekly thereafter; 0.015 mg/mL at trough on day 21, AUC ~0.36\u2009\u03bcg*hr/mL) did not induce regression but resulted in tumor growth inhibition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2B</a>)."

The observations that 1) saturation of the GDC-0810 and the fulvestrant ER degradation machinery occur differentially in our doxycycline-inducible ER-over-expressing MCF7 cell line (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and 2) that fulvestrant, but not GDC-0810, drives degradation of ER in the rat uterus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F</a>), further supports the notion that these compounds have distinct mechanisms by which they induce ER degradation, and potentially require differing co-factors or distinct sets of E3 ligases. The observation that activation of the ER pathway occurs concomitantly with lack of robust ER degradation upon GDC-0810 treatment in the rat uterus suggests that although ER degradation is not absolutely required for direct ER antagonism, it may be associated with preventing ER agonism, at least in this context."

GW5P2 was experimentally derived from efforts to identify unique, selective conformation-sensing peptides using a random 10-residue peptide phage display library in the presence of GW5638 or its metabolite GW7604 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iannone et al., 2004</a>). 47P3 was subsequently generated as an attempt to make a second generation, higher affinity, more specific peptide for the GW7604:ER complex. Notably, the binding of the GW5P2 and 47P3 peptides to various ER:ligand complexes was highly correlated with the presence of an acrylic or carboxylic acid head group in ligand structures (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iannone et al., 2004</a>). The binding of GW5P2 and 47P3 to the ER:GDC-0810 complex thus likely reflects the presence of this acrylic acid side chain in GDC-0810. It was speculated that these selective peptides may be affinity-optimized versions of naturally occurring co-repressor peptides which are yet to be discovered (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iannone et al., 2004</a>).

Despite expressing 50% or less of the mutant allele, these cells display robust estrogen-independent ER signaling and estrogen-independent cell proliferation. Cell competition assays further highlight that much of the competitive advantage of the mutant cells occurs in the absence of estrogen, mimicking AI-treatment, and that this competitive advantage is lost both in the presence of estrogen and in the presence of GDC-0810. These data are consistent with recent retrospective clinical studies showing that ESR1 mutations in plasma DNA predict relative resistance to AIs but not to fulvestrant (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fribbens et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Schiavon et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Spoerke et al., 2016</a>).

Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations of ER mutants have demonstrated that the Y537S and D538G substitutions shift ER, and particularly helix 12 (H12), into a conformation that resembles an active/liganded ER wild-type conformation, providing a molecular explanation for the constitutive activity of these mutations (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nettles et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Toy et al., 2013</a>). A recent biophysical analysis of these mutants has provided an important extension of those findings, demonstrating that this 'pre-organized agonist state' restricts access to the ligand binding domain, which influences binding of both estrogen and tamoxifen, and presumably other ligands, including GDC-0810, which is consistent with what we show here (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fanning et al., 2016</a>). Fanning et al. further demonstrate that tamoxifen fails to fully restore H12 as well as the H11-12 loop back to the wild-type antagonist state, providing a further explanation for reduced tamoxifen potency in the mutant context. They hypothesize that highly potent, next generation SERDs, including GDC-0810, may have an increased ability to destabilize H12 and thereby drive efficacy in the ER mutant setting. Our observations that despite the somewhat reduced potency in vitro, GDC-0810 displays robust activity in mutant models in vivo, are in line with this hypothesis, although we acknowledge that tamoxifen likewise exhibits robust in vivo efficacy in the WHIM20 ER.Y537S model. The data demonstrating in vivo activity for GDC-0810 in ER mutant models is consistent with: 1) the in vivo exposures of GDC-0810 being sufficient to overcome the potency shifts caused by ER.Y537S in vitro, and 2) the level of ER pathway suppression driven by GDC-0810 in the mutant context being sufficient for in vivo anti-tumor activity. How these pre-clinical studies will relate to clinical observations is an ongoing question; the activity of GDC-0810 in ER mutant versus wild-type patients is being carefully monitored in clinical studies."

However, the question still remains as to how much advantage SERDs will have relative to ER ligands that function as potent antagonists in the absence of ER degradation. Indeed, our data shows that despite differences in activity in vitro, tamoxifen, like GDC-0810 is efficacious in ER.WT and mutant models in vivo, and it could be argued that the superior activity of GDC-0810 could in some cases be due to its potent antagonistic effects coupled together with good bioavailability and PK properties, rather than its ability to lower ER protein levels. Along these lines, we show that GDC-0810\u2019s ER degradation activity can be uncoupled from its antagonistic activity in MCF7 cells. A recent study likewise highlighted the activity of bazedoxifene, a SERD/SERM hybrid that displays only modest ER degradation activity relative to fulvestrant and GDC-0810, as having robust efficacy against ER.WT and mutant models both in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wardell et al., 2015</a>). It stands to reason that in many cases, antagonism of the ER signaling pathway should be sufficient to drive anti-tumor activity. We argue that the benefit of SERDs vs. non-degrader antagonists will be most apparent in those contexts where ER becomes reactivated in the presence of drug, such as is observed in the TamR1 xenograft, in which tamoxifen behaves as a strong agonist. Since the relatively limited number of pre-clinical in vivo models fails to recapitulate the multiple potential mechanisms of ER-dependent resistance, nor the profound heterogeneity that exists across ER+ breast cancer patients, we feel that this is a question that will ultimately be addressed in the clinic, as we gain additional experience with GDC-0810 and other SERDs."

Following emergence of tamoxifen resistant tumor growth the daily tamoxifen dose was increased to 120 mg/kg/day. The tumors which continued to grow under these conditions were serially passaged and evaluated for continued tamoxifen resistance.

Exogenous estradiol is required for robust growth of this patient derived tumor line, and is supplied in the form of estradiol impregnated beeswax pellets.

The right mammary fat pad of recipient animals was exposed by a 1\u00a0cm incision on the ventral mid-line at the level of the fourth mammary. The blood vessels were cauterized and the fat pad blunt dissected from the abdominal wall and skin. Tumor fragments were excised from donor animals, chopped into fragments approximately 8\u00a0mm<sup>3</sup> (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2\u00a0mm), implanted in the region of the cleared mammary fat pad, and the incision was closed with wound clips. Estradiol impregnated beeswax pellets were implanted subcutaneously into the interscapular space of recipient animals on the day of tumor implant. Recipient animals were ovariectomized 19 days after tumor fragment implant. One group of animals was designated as a control for estradiol independent tumor growth (Vehicle-E2) and the estradiol impregnated pellets were excised on the first day of dosing.

Second, a point of considerable discussion among reviewers involved the need to analyze the relationship between ER SERD and ER antagonist activity. This needs to be done in the context of the work by others in the field, but more importantly in the context of the in vitro vs. in vivo results presented in the manuscript itself: It is notable that GDC-0810, a SERD, and tamoxifen, an antagonist with no SERD activity, show comparable efficacy in suppressing xenograft growth. Hence, the statement, \"Together, these in vitro results support the discovery strategy of optimizing ER\u03b1 degradation in addition to ER\u03b1 antagonism.\" appears to be contradicted by your results from the in vivo models. From what you present, one could conclude that beyond its superior PK and oral availability (which are clearly significant advances allowing higher dosing), GDC-0810 does not have mechanistic superiority over other SERDs and ER antagonists. This whole issue requires careful clarification and could benefit from additional work."

Their strategy is based on first identifying compounds that work as estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) that were then studied further in a variety of ways to examine their efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability. There is a clear need for such drugs, since currently used agents that also degrade ER (Fulvestrant) have poor pharmacokinetic properties and must be given to breast cancer patients by intramuscular injection, a route that is painful and probably still gives an insufficient exposure of the tumors to the drug."

Work by other investigators using other SERDs and ER antagonists in these types of resistance models should be cited and discussed (Wardell, Ellis et al. 2015 in Clinical Cancer Research; Couillard et al. 1998 in Cancer Research). In particular, Discussion should address in some detail the Wardell paper as well as previous work by those authors (Wardell et al. 2013 Clinical Cancer Research, Wardell et al. 2011 Biochemical Pharmacology) regarding the question of whether degradation of ER by GDC-0810 is necessary for the drug's antitumor effects."

It would be valuable if you could show a context (e.g., resistance due to Y537S) where the degradation matters in vivo.

Second, a point of considerable discussion among reviewers involved the need to analyze the relationship between ER SERD and ER antagonist activity. This needs to be done in the context of the work by others in the field, but more importantly in the context of the in vitro vs. in vivo results presented in the manuscript itself: It is notable that GDC-0810, a SERD, and tamoxifen, an antagonist with no SERD activity, show comparable efficacy in suppressing xenograft growth. Hence, the statement, \"Together, these in vitro results support the discovery strategy of optimizing ER\u03b1 degradation in addition to ER\u03b1 antagonism.\" appears to be contradicted by your results from the in vivo models. From what you present, one could conclude that beyond its superior PK and oral availability (which are clearly significant advances allowing higher dosing), GDC-0810 does not have mechanistic superiority over other SERDs and ER antagonists. This whole issue requires careful clarification and could benefit from additional work.</i>"

We have made significant investments in addressing the relationship between ER degradation and antagonist activity, including experimentally, by removing some data to de-emphasize some points, and by better placing our data and discussion in context of what has been previously reported. We demonstrate, using additional experimental data, that GDC-0810\u2019s ability to suppress ER signaling can be uncoupled from its ability to deplete ER, and acknowledge here, and in the Discussion that its potent ER antagonism coupled with good PK and bioavailability are likely all major contributing factors to robust in vivo efficacy, potentially independent of degradation. We also note though, in the context of newly included uterus data, that ER degradation may be associated with preventing ER agonism, which may be more relevant for long-term/acquired resistance in vivo. We believe the manuscript has greatly benefited from clarification surrounding this important issue (specific details below)."

Work by other investigators using other SERDs and ER antagonists in these types of resistance models should be cited and discussed (Wardell, Ellis et al. 2015 in Clinical Cancer Research; Couillard et al. 1998 in Cancer Research). In particular, Discussion should address in some detail the Wardell paper as well as previous work by those authors (Wardell et al. 2013 Clinical Cancer Research, Wardell et al. 2011 Biochemical Pharmacology) regarding the question of whether degradation of ER by GDC-0810 is necessary for the drug's antitumor effects.</i>"

We find, similar to what had previously been reported for fulvestrant and bazedoxifene, that the depletion of ER is neither required for the ability of GDC-0810 to suppress the expression of PR, as a read-out for ER pathway activity, nor for its ability to suppress the proliferation of MCF7 cells. This is entirely consistent with the demonstration that GDC-0810 acts directly as an ER antagonist, by outcompeting E2 and changing the ER conformation such that the PGC1\u03b1 co-activator, for example, is displaced, in cell free assays where degradation does not occur. We note here that while over-expression of ER had previously been seen to block ER degradation mediated by fulvestrant, in our experiment fulvestrant retained its degradation activity. We speculate that the overexpression of ER in our doxycycline-inducible cells may not be as high as what was reported previously \u2013 though these levels are sufficient to prevent GDC-0810\u2019s ability to deplete ER, consistent with distinct mechanisms of degradation driven by fulvestrant versus GDC-0810."

We propose that the advantage of the SERD approach will be most clearly highlighted in cases that represent re-activation of ER signaling in the presence of therapeutics, illustrated by the TamR1 model for example. It has been argued that clinically, ER-dependent resistance mechanisms to both AI\u2019s and SERMs account for a high fraction of resistant and relapsing disease. Unfortunately, our pre-clinical models do not represent this scenario, and are far from representative of the enormous heterogeneity of ER-dependent resistance mechanisms likely to be found in the clinic. We argue that truly understanding whether the SERD approach will drive meaningful benefit over what can be achieved with antagonist/tamoxifen-like approaches will be unveiled only through rigorous clinical testing in that heterogeneous population. Recent clinical trial results indicate that fulvestrant is superior to aromatase inhibitor (FALCON) and prior trials indicate that aromatase inhibitors and equal to or superior to tamoxifen. Since these points provide important context for this manuscript we have now tried to be considerably more direct, clear and balanced in this respect, in particular in our revised Discussion (last paragraph)."
