While these models have been extremely powerful in interpreting dopamine activity, they typically do not use value derived through inference in computing errors. This is important because much real world behavior \u2013 and thus many opportunities for error-driven learning \u2013 is based on such predictions. Here, we show that error-signaling rat dopamine neurons respond to the inferred, model-based value of cues that have not been paired with reward and do so in the same framework as they track the putative cached value of cues previously paired with reward. This suggests that dopamine neurons access a wider variety of information than contemplated by standard TD models and that, while their firing conforms to predictions of TD models in some cases, they may not be restricted to signaling errors from TD predictions."

In some cases, the cues directly predicted rewards based on the rats\u2019 previous experience; in other cases, the cues predicted rewards only indirectly and based on inference. Sadacca et al. found that the dopamine neurons fired in similar ways in response to the cues in both of these situations. This result is consistent with the proposal that dopamine neurons use both types of information to calculate errors in predictions. These findings provide a mechanism by which dopamine neurons could support a much broader and more complex range of learning than previously thought."

This proposal was initially based on observations that these neurons fired more strongly to unpredicted than to predicted reward, suppressed firing on omission of a predicted reward, and developed firing to reward-paired cues with learning (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1994</a>). Further work has shown that phasic activity in dopamine neurons obeys formal predictions for such TD error signals under more complex conditions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Waelti et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tobler et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lak et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hart et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</a>), including in tasks such as blocking and conditioned inhibition, in which experimental conditions are arranged to precisely distinguish between prediction error signals and other possible explanations of such activity. These studies have confirmed that the neural correlates correspond closely to the theoretical accounts. Indeed careful work in monkeys has shown that the activity provides a quantitative match with the error signal described in the TD model (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</a>). With the advent of optogenetic techniques and Cre-driver lines in rats, it has also been shown in rats that artificially stimulating or inhibiting likely dopamine neurons for very brief periods is sufficient to restore the associative learning driven by endogenous positive or negative prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib47\">Steinberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2016</a>), suggesting that phasic activity in dopamine neurons can act like a prediction error, at least in some downstream targets and behavioral paradigms (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glimcher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schultz, 2002</a>)."

The errors in TD models, at least as they have been applied to interpret the firing of dopamine neurons, are based on the value that has been assigned to events based on direct experience (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glimcher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schultz, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Niv and Schoenbaum, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Clark et al., 2012</a>). This so-called <i>cached</i> value is pre-computed and resides in the predictive event, be it a primary reward or reward-predicting cue. The value is calculated free of any other predictive information about the environment, defining this class of algorithms as <i>model-free</i>. While these TD models have been extremely powerful in interpreting the activity of dopamine neurons in tasks in which value is based on experienced reward, they are unable to compute prediction errors elicited in situations in which value is derived through inference rather than through direct experience. Deriving a value (or a prediction) based on inference \u2013 meaning to deduce from an understanding of the relationships amongst environmental stimuli and events - is a hallmark of a second class of algorithms, termed <i>model-based</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Daw et al., 2005</a>)."

Rarely does one engage in value-based behavior that is simply a pure repetition of prior learning; typically moderating or mitigating information acquired in other situations, separate from the original learning, influences our decision-making. This basic concept is operationalized (and the effect of such <i>inferred</i> or <i>model-based</i> value, isolated) in sensory pre-conditioning (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brogden, 1939</a>). In this task, animals first learn that one innocuous cue (cue A) predicts another (cue B), in the absence of reward, and then later learn that the second cue (B) is a reliable predictor of reward. Cue A has not been directly paired with reward and thus it has not had any opportunity to acquire any cached value (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glimcher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Niv and Schoenbaum, 2008</a>). As a result, cue A cannot elicit a TD prediction error, despite the fact that it has value as defined by the animal\u2019s responding and its ability to modulate error-driven learning (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jones et al., 2012</a>). If TD models are an accurate and complete description of the information contained in dopamine neuron activity, then cue A should not elicit dopamine neuron firing, at least not above the level of a control cue."

In the second phase, rats learned that the second cue of one pair (B) predicted reward and the other (D) did not; learning was reflected in an increase in responding at the food cup during presentation of B (ANOVA, main effect of cue: F <sub>1, 163</sub> = 280.1, p&lt;0.001, main effect of session: F <sub>5, 163</sub> = 9.7, interaction: F <sub>5, 163</sub> = 10.81, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Finally, in the third phase, the rats were presented again with the four cues, first a reminder of cue B and D\u2019s reward contingency followed by an unrewarded probe test of responding to cues A and C. As expected, the rats responded at the food cup significantly more during presentation of A, the cue that predicted B, than during presentation of C, the cue that predicted D (ANOVA, main effect of cue: F <sub>1, 167</sub> = 8.7, p&lt;0.001, main effect of trial: F <sub>5, 167</sub> = 6.08, p&lt;0.001, interaction: F <sub>5, 167</sub> = 2.07, p=0.07; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

To identify putative dopamine neurons, we used a recently developed, optogenetically-validated strategy that classifies VTA neurons on the basis of their response dynamics during Pavlovian conditioning. In published work (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Eshel et al., 2015</a>), this strategy identified VTA dopamine neurons (i.e. neurons expressing Cre under the control of the promoter for the dopamine transporter) with near perfect fidelity. Here we applied this same analysis to the mean normalized responses of all VTA neurons recorded during conditioning and reminder sessions (n = 632; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We extracted the major modes of variation among the neurons with principal components analysis (PCA; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and then performed hierarchical clustering on those PCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This analysis successfully extracted the 3 previously described VTA response types from our data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>): neurons with sustained excitation to cues and reward (putative GABAergic), neurons with phasic excitation to cue onset and reward onset (putative dopaminergic), and neurons with sustained inhibition to cue and reward (unknown). We then assessed the responses of the putative dopamine neurons (n = 304) to the cue and reward over the course of conditioning. Consistent with their classification, we found changes in firing during conditioning that were in accord with signaling of reward prediction errors. Specifically, early in conditioning, these neurons\u2019 maximal response occurred just after reward delivery (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, top trace), whereas late in conditioning, the maximal response occurred just after onset of the cue predicting that reward (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, lower traces). As a result, the difference in activity at the time of cue onset versus reward increased significantly from the start to the end of conditioning (r <sub>302</sub> = 0.24, p&lt;0.01; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), consistent with signaling of TD prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glimcher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schultz, 2002</a>)."

While the common element of these responses could reflect novelty or salience, since these cues had not been presented for a number of days, or perhaps generalization from conditioning to B, the actual phasic neural response was significantly stronger for A, the cue that predicted the reward-paired cue, than for C, the preconditioned control cue (t <sub>51</sub> = 5.02, p&lt;0.001). This difference cannot be explained on the basis of novelty, salience, or generalization, since A and C were treated similarly. Nor can it be explained by direct experience with reward, because A was never paired with reward, and it was only paired with B before conditioning. Thus, the phasic response in these putative dopamine neurons appeared to be influenced by inferred value of cue A. Interestingly, the neural response was perhaps somewhat better at discriminating A from C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, bottom panel) than B from D (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, top panel), perhaps reflecting the differences in training between A and C, which were only presented a few times in unrewarded sessions, versus B and D, which were presented many times across several days of conditioning. Despite this, the influence of the inferred value of cue A on the firing of these neurons during the first second of their cue response was strongly and significantly correlated with the influence of value on these neurons firing at the onset of B, the cue directly paired with reward (r <sub>50</sub> = 0.63, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Notably this was also true for a handful of neurons (n = 4) that exhibited the classic wide, polyphasic waveforms traditionally used to identify dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, filled circles, see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for PSTH\u2019s). This relationship in the initial phasic response to the cues did not reach significance in the other two neural subtypes identified by the clustering analysis (see <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a> for analyses of tonically-modulated neurons)."

This elevated firing may be a sign of dopamine\u2019s reported ability to anticipate proximity to reward or to signal state value (<a href=\"#bib23\">Howe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hamid et al., 2016</a>), if our rats\u2019 expectation of reward delivery is based on knowing that progression to the offset of cue A should lead to the subsequent presentation of cue B and then reward. Importantly, in our design, reward is presented during B rather than at its termination. This would explain why this pattern of sustained firing is not present throughout cue B (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, t<sub>51</sub>= 1.09, p=0.278). Interestingly this pattern of sustained and differential firing to A (vs C) and not to B (vs D) in the putative dopamine neurons is the mirror image of firing in neurons classified as tonically excited, which showed relatively modest changes in sustained firing to A and C and much larger increases in firing to B (see <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This relationship would be consistent with recent proposals that these neurons, thought to be GABAergic (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>), exert tonic inhibition to suppress the firing of dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eshel et al., 2015</a>)."

In addition, they were greater than responses to a control cue that was treated similarly and thus had similar levels of salience or novelty or generalized value, all variables that have been proposed to explain phasic activity in other settings that appeared to be at odds with the standard explanation of phasic dopamine activity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</a>).

While this result does not require the use of inference in calculating errors, merely access to state information, it suggests that dopamine neurons have access to a major source of this information, given the central role of the orbitofrontal cortex in inference-based behavior (<a href=\"#bib46\">Stalnaker et al., 2015</a>)."

We used a carefully designed behavioral preparation in which our critical cue of interest has no prior history of association with reward, thus unique firing to this cue cannot be explained as any sort of cached value (see \u2018<i>A comment on the basis of responding to the preconditioned cue\u2019 in the behavioral Methods for further information)</i>. Further this appetitive task includes two important control cues: one designed to rule out explanations based on generalization and salience (cue C) and another designed to reveal cached value prediction errors (cue B). The inclusion of this cue in particular is important because it allows us to assess the relationship between traditional error signals and any influence of inferred value on the firing of the dopamine neurons."

While this might be explained as error signaling to B, calculated from TD models, and error signaling to A, calculated from something beyond TD models, this solution is cumbersome, particularly given that inferred and experienced value are actually confounded for a cue directly paired with reward (a fact illustrated by the normal efficacy of reinforcer devaluation at changing conditioned responding [<a href=\"#bib20\">Holland and Straub, 1979</a>]). A more parsimonious explanation is that dopamine neurons, unlike standard TD models, have access to a wide variety of information when computing expected value. And that while their firing may conform to what is expected for errors calculated from TD models in some special cases, they may not be signaling TD derived errors. Such a suggestion aligns nicely with recent proposals that dopamine neurons signal errors based on changes in economic utility (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schultz et al., 2015</a>), and it would be consistent with data presented in abstract form suggesting that cue-evoked dopamine release in nucleus accumbens is sensitive to devaluation of a paired reward (<a href=\"#bib32\">Martinez et al., 2008</a>), though it contradicts data only just published from a similar study in which cue-evoked release was not immediately altered when reward value was manipulated via salt depletion (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cone et al., 2016</a>). This variability in correspondence between our unit data and evidence from studies of dopamine efflux in accumbens may reflect to the different dynamics of the two processes or it may indicate some specificity with regard to the information content of the dopaminergic afferents in accumbens versus other areas."

One set, most relevant to the single unit correlates that form the basis of this hypothesis, concerns the information used to construct the error signals. This is obviously the part of the question we have addressed in the current study. That is, do dopaminergic errors reflect only model-free information derived from TD systems or do they also incorporate the predictions of non-TD, model-based systems? We believe our data favor the latter position."

Do they act only to stamp in the so-called cached values that are acquired through learning in TD models or do they act more broadly to facilitate increases in the strength of associative representations in a way that is orthogonal to distinctions between the systems, model-free or model based, in which those representations reside? The latter role would be more in accord with earlier learning theory accounts that viewed prediction errors as acting on the strength of associative representations (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glimcher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bush and Mosteller, 1951</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rescorla et al., 1972</a>). Importantly the answer to the second question is formally separate from the answer to the first. In other words, phasic changes in dopamine may reflect model-based information and yet only act to support model-free, cached-value learning. Or phasic changes in dopamine could act more broadly, supporting both model-free and model-based learning, even if they only reflected value predictions from the former system."

In support of dopamine\u2019s role in supporting model-based learning, prediction errors observed in ventral striatal target regions seem to reflect both model based and model free information (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daw et al., 2011</a>). Further studies have shown that elevated dopamine levels, either observed (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deserno et al., 2015</a>) or directly manipulated (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wunderlich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sharp et al., 2016</a>), bias subjects towards making model-based decisions, as do changes to dopaminergic gene expression (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doll et al., 2016</a>). While suggestive, these studies do not directly distinguish the effects of phasic changes in dopamine neuron firing or release from the effects of slower tonic changes. Such tonic changes may play a very different role from the phasic error signals observed in single unit activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hamid et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Niv et al., 2007</a>). Further these studies do not isolate the effects of errors themselves, independent from other confounding variables. Such isolation and specificity can be achieved using Cre-driver lines in rodent species, and as noted earlier, there is now strong evidence from such studies that brief, phasic changes in dopamine neuron firing can act like a prediction error, at least in some downstream targets and behavioral paradigms (<a href=\"#bib47\">Steinberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2016</a>). However the behavior supported by the artificially induced prediction errors in these experiments may be either model-based or model-free (or a mixture). A more definitive answer to this question will require these approaches to be married to paradigms that distinguish these two types of learning."

Briefly, this account suggests that following the initial pairings of A and B, subsequent presentations of B for conditioning activate a representation of A in memory within a relatively close temporal contiguity with the delivery of sucrose, resulting in the representation of A becoming directly associated with this reward. If this were to occur, then at test, the subsequent conditioned responding to A might reflect the cue\u2019s direct association with sucrose, rather than requiring B to bridge the experiences of A and sucrose."

We first performed principal components analysis on a matrix of neural responses during cue B and reward presentation (neuron-by-time) to simplify the neural dynamics to the 3 most descriptive ways in which neurons differed. We then classified this description of the neural population (first 3 principal components) with a simple unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm, finding the similarity (Euclidean distance) between all pairs of neurons in principal components space, and iteratively grouping the neurons them into larger and larger clusters on the basis of their similarity (i.e. agglomerative complete-linkage clustering).

This paper, however, uses \"inferred value\" in a different way apparently synonymous with model-based value. This un-discussed difference in terminology makes it sound like the authors are (perhaps unintentionally) dismissing the previous work as invalid. The authors seem to state that study was merely \"suggestive\" of inferred prediction errors because it was subject to \"confounding\" issues, but it would be more accurate to say that both studies had valid results and were simply studying different forms of inference, or were defining \"inference\" in different ways."

In my view, a \"TD error\" is a Bellman residual, the temporal difference between the reward predicted at times t vs t+1, which is precisely consistent with these responses. The issue is where the predictions themselves come from, i.e. whether they can have themselves been learned by caching simple adjustments driven by previous TD errors, vs. some more complicated inference (a computational distinction due to Daw et al., 2005). TD *errors*, in short, need not only arise (only) from TD *learning*, even though the former drive the latter. This was perhaps first pointed out in the context of a human imaging study (Daw et al. 2011) which somewhat presaged these results and their interpretation."

(An alternative \u2013 suggested in more human work by Gershman et al., 2012, and computationally by Sutton's, 1991, DYNA \u2013 is that replay between the conditioning and transfer phases, driving regular TD updating, would integrate the information.) The former possibility directly instantiates the suggestion, dismissed briefly in the discussion of Bromberg-Martin's (2010) similar result, that this result might be due to simple TD plus some altered state representation (here that state B and A are combined; in general \u2013 Dayan 1991 \u2013 that states are represented by their successors). I agree that this study is a cleaner and more stripped down test of integrative prediction than Bromberg-Martin's serial reversal, but it is just wrong to distinguish them in the way described here."

However, it is possible that this difference could relate to features other than the reward contingency. Selection criteria for putative dopamine neurons include the responsiveness to a reward-associated cue, specifically stimulus B and so, by design, there is a systematic selection bias towards neurons that respond to stimulus B. Therefore, it is feasible that the increased firing to stimulus B over stimulus D is due to the sensory properties of stimulus B since regardless of which auditory stimulus was designated as stimulus B in a particular subject, neurons were selected that responded to that stimulus. The authors need to address this potential confound, especially given that the mode response of the putative dopamine neurons did not discriminate between stimuli B and D (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

The concern is that if all the stimuli that were not directly paired with reward (A, C and D) were compared, significance would be lost. The authors should test whether the differences between responses to A and C are still significant if the analysis includes the responses to all of the stimuli (two-way ANOVA or comprehensive one-way ANOVA).

For instance, suppose something about the reminder treatment (e.g. the presentations of B/D or the deliveries of rewards) put the animals in a state of generalized enhanced responsiveness to the A/C cues, a state which slowly waned with time or habituated with repeated presentation of A/C cues.

To make sure, we designed our task to limit the possibility of associative retrieval during conditioning \u2013 so called mediated learning. This was done both by forward pre-conditioning the two cues (ie A-&gt;B rather that AB in parallel or even worse, B-&gt;A) and also by giving several days of conditioning in which B is presented but A is not. Both choices should in theory minimize mediated learning. We believe this conjecture is strongly supported by data showing that inactivation of the OFC in the probe test abolishes responding to the preconditioned cue in this paradigm without affecting responding to the cue paired directly with reward (1). If responding to the preconditioned cue were due to learning \u2013 whether mediated or not \u2013 in the second phase, we think we would not see effects of OFC inactivation on subsequent responding, since there is no evidence that OFC is necessary for recalling previously acquired independent bits of information like this (5-8).
