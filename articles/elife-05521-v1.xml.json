Here we systematically assessed the expression and function of <i>Angiopoietin-1</i> (<i>Angpt1</i>) in bone marrow. <i>Angpt1</i> was not expressed by osteoblasts. <i>Angpt1</i> was most highly expressed by HSCs, and at lower levels by c-kit<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors, megakaryocytes, and Leptin Receptor<sup>+</sup> (LepR<sup>+</sup>) stromal cells. Global conditional deletion of <i>Angpt1</i>, or deletion from osteoblasts, LepR<i>+</i> cells, <i>Nes-cre</i>-expressing cells, megakaryocytes, endothelial cells or hematopoietic cells in normal mice did not affect hematopoiesis, HSC maintenance, or HSC quiescence. Deletion of <i>Angpt1</i> from hematopoietic cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> cells had little effect on vasculature or HSC frequency under steady-state conditions but accelerated vascular and hematopoietic recovery after irradiation while increasing vascular leakiness. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> stromal cells regulate niche regeneration by secreting Angpt1, reducing vascular leakiness but slowing niche recovery."
