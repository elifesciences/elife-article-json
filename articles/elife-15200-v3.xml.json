Understanding how connections form during evolution, in disease and across individuals requires knowledge of the basic tenets that govern kinase-substrate interactions. We identify criteria sufficient for establishing regulatory links between a MAPK and a non-native substrate. The yeast MAPK Fus3 and human MAPK ERK2 can be functionally redirected if only two conditions are met: the kinase and substrate contain matching interaction domains and the substrate includes a phospho-motif that can be phosphorylated by the kinase and recruit a downstream effector. We used a panel of interaction domains and phosphorylation-activated degradation motifs to demonstrate modular and scalable retargeting. We applied our approach to reshape the signaling behavior of an existing kinase pathway. Together, our results demonstrate that a MAPK can be largely defined by its interaction domains and compatible phospho-motifs and provide insight into how MAPK-substrate connections form."

Understanding how connections form during evolution, in disease and across individuals requires knowledge of the basic tenets that govern kinase-substrate interactions. We identify criteria sufficient for establishing regulatory links between a MAPK and a non-native substrate. The yeast MAPK Fus3 and human MAPK ERK2 can be functionally redirected if only two conditions are met: the kinase and substrate contain matching interaction domains and the substrate includes a phospho-motif that can be phosphorylated by the kinase and recruit a downstream effector. We used a panel of interaction domains and phosphorylation-activated degradation motifs to demonstrate modular and scalable retargeting. We applied our approach to reshape the signaling behavior of an existing kinase pathway. Together, our results demonstrate that a MAPK can be largely defined by its interaction domains and compatible phospho-motifs and provide insight into how MAPK-substrate connections form."

Experiments with budding yeast showed that a MAPK could only achieve this if two conditions are met. First, the target protein and kinase need to bind to each other.

This suggests that connections between kinases and their targets can be rewired simple by mixing together parts of other existing proteins.

For the expansion of the MAPK signaling module to have been feasible, it needed to be amenable to forming new kinase-substrate regulatory links, while at the same time having the capacity to avoid unwanted crosstalk. However, it still remains unclear what information is sufficient to create an entirely new set of regulatory interactions. One way to understand how potentially large numbers of novel regulatory links can be established is by developing a scalable method to create such links ourselves (<a href=\"#bib21\">Elowitz and Lim, 2010</a>)."

However, it is the site that is phosphorylated \u2013 rather than the kinase itself \u2013 that mediates the functional outcome of kinase regulation. In particular, the phosphorylated phospho-motif can be recognized by a regulatory protein bearing a phospho-motif binding domain and control protein localization or degradation among many other effects (<a href=\"#bib65\">Seet et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</a>)."

Regulation of a modified native substrate by a kinase can also be rescued using a pair of completely heterologous interaction domains (<a href=\"#bib79\">Yadav et al., 2009</a>). These studies show that by controlling the colocalization of a kinase with a native \u2013 or closely related \u2013 substrate allows the functional regulation of that target. Taking it a step further, two groups have recently used native MAPK-interacting motifs \u2013 \u2018docking domains\u2019 \u2013 to allow several types of MAPKs in mammalian cells and yeast to regulate the nuclear localization of fluorescent reporters (<a href=\"#bib56\">Regot et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Durandau et al., 2015</a>). Although it is generally accepted that docking domains primarily control colocalization (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sharrocks et al., 2000</a>), several studies suggest that binding may also serve to allosterically regulate the MAPK (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Heo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Zhou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Tokunaga et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</a>).

However, the number of naturally occurring kinase-substrate docking interactions inherently limits the scalability of the approach. For example, a given kinase \u2018module\u2019 cannot be reused in parallel signaling pathways, because it would not be able to distinguish between downstream targets in one pathway versus another. To overcome this limitation, it would be useful to be able to tease apart the \u2018targeting\u2019 module of the kinase from the \u2018enzymatic\u2019 module\u2014and likewise, the \u2018targeting\u2019 and \u2018effector\u2019 modules of the substrate.

Upon phosphorylation, the phosphodegron interacts with a specialized F-box protein \u2013 Cdc4 \u2013 to recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase machinery (the SCF complex), which then marks the substrate for degradation by covalently attaching a poly-ubiquitin chain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>). A phosphodegron has the added benefit of making a functional phosphorylation event easy to observe: if the substrate protein is a fluorescent reporter, such as YFP, phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination is followed by a decrease in YFP fluorescence. Thus, this approach is amenable to high-throughput measurements in a way that changes in localization may not be."

The transcription factor Tec1 fulfills these criteria, as it has been shown to be both a substrate for Fus3 and Cdc4 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chou et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bao et al., 2010</a>)\u2014thus, we chose a region of Tec1 that encompassed several residues up and downstream of the Cdc4 consensus sequence (37 residues, total) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nash et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Orlicky et al., 2003</a>). Also, since Cdc4 primarily acts in the nucleus, we added a nuclear localization signal derived from SV40 large T-antigen to the N-terminus of the protein (<a href=\"#bib10\">Blondel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kalderon et al., 1984</a>). To complete our synthetic substrate, we needed to control its interaction with an engineered kinase. To this end, we added the mPDZ domain to the YFP-degron fusion, a modular protein interaction domain that has been used in a variety of different contexts (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dueber et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Moon et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ryu and Park, 2015</a>). To target Fus3 to the new substrate, we fused the complementary interaction domain, the PDZ ligand, to its C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As in all the following experiments, these constructs were integrated as a single copy into the haploid yeast genome. Moreover, since we were only concerned with whether our modified Fus3 construct was able to functionally target our new YFP substrate \u2013 and not the behavior of other effectors downstream of the mating pathway \u2013 we did not remove the native <i>FUS3</i> gene\u2014thus, our modified Fus3 construct operated in parallel with the native Fus3."

We observed a ~3.7-fold drop in the yeast strain containing both the Fus3-mPDZ ligand fusion and our new YFP-degron-mPDZ construct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). On the other hand, the drop in fluorescence was not observed when the phospho-acceptor residues in the degron (two threonine residues) were changed to methionine and alanine (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bao et al., 2010</a>), when the catalytic site of the targeted kinase was inactivated with a K42R mutation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gartner et al., 1992</a>), or when the interaction domain fused to YFP was changed to an SH3 domain. The latter suggests that the Tec1 degron is not able to directly recruit Fus3 to the YFP construct on its own. Finally, we also found that the drop in YFP fusion protein level was sensitive to the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, strongly suggesting that the construct was indeed being tagged and actively degraded (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Following induction of the mating pathway with \u03b1-factor, we measured the YFP fluorescence of the cells using flow cytometry and observed qualitatively similar substrate degradation. However, the fold change observed three hours post induction for the swapped domains was approximately half that of the original orientation (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This is likely due to the fusions affecting either protein expression or sterically interfering with the function of one of the involved enzymes.

The association of the protein domains PYL and ABI can be controlled using the small-molecule plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, right side) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liang et al., 2011</a>). When we fused these domains to Fus3 and our YFP-phosphodegron reporter, we\u00a0observed\u00a0a change in the fluorescent signal\u00a0only when the concentration of ABA was 1\u2009\u03bcM\u00a0or\u00a0higher (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These results provide additional evidence both that the kinase and substrate are indifferent as to the nature of their interaction, and that the targeting of the kinase to the substrate directly triggers the observed degradation, as the decrease in the\u00a0YFP\u00a0signal is correlated with ABA dose. However, it is important to note that the identity of the interaction domain fused to the YFP-phosphodegron target influenced the steady-state fluorescence of the reporter (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, even interaction domains with similar affinities may not have equivalent behaviors when used inside of cells."

In the presence of \u03b1-factor alone only the mCherry signal was reduced, while the YFP value remained unchanged. Only when both \u03b1-factor and ABA\u00a0were\u00a0added, did we see a drop in the YFP signal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). From this perspective, the two Fus3 variants are analogous to orthologous MAPKs, with each targeting its own substrate."

We tested whether this decrease in efficiency was due to competition\u2014either between the two copies of Fus3 for the pool of the\u00a0activated upstream MAPK kinase, Ste7, or between the substrates for the ubiquitination/degradation machinery. To examine this question we constructed strains that expressed our standard system \u2013 one kinase targeting one substrate \u2013 and added either a competing copy of Fus3 or a competing substrate. In both experiments we observed a diminished response in YFP degradation in the presence of the competitor (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>).

We constructed two additional variants of the phosphodegron motif that more closely mimicked the amino acid sequence of the published \u2018consensus motif\u2019 for the WD40 domain of Cdc4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nash et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Orlicky et al., 2003</a>). The sequences of the two variants only differ at one site \u2014 two residues N-terminal of the phosphorylated threonine \u2014 where the Cdc4 consensus leucine was changed to a proline, an amino acid that is supposed to be preferred by Fus3 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mok et al., 2010</a>). Both variants had similar behaviors, with a similarly decreased rate of degradation relative to the phosphodegron derived from Tec1. (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These results suggest that phosphodegron design is flexible, and with more study it may become feasible to rationally tune their degradation dynamics. Moreover, the number of phosphodegrons is not limited to those found in nature. Taken together, these results demonstrate that our approach is applicable to several different phosphodegrons, and lays out a framework for how phosphodegrons may be used to alter degradation dynamics of a protein of interest."

We focused on the human MAPK, ERK2\u2014a widely studied kinase implicated in several pathologies, which has also been previously studied in the context of yeast (<a href=\"#bib52\">O'Shaughnessy et al., 2011</a>). Native ERK2 has been shown to regulate protein stability via phosphodegrons; for example, a phosphodegron found in the protein MKP1 is targeted by ERK2 and subsequently tagged by the ubiquitin machinery and degraded (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin and Yang, 2006</a>). Our engineered substrate consisted of a 64 residue region surrounding the phosphodegron of MKP-1 fused to a YFP reporter. Rather than port the entire ERK2 signaling cascade into yeast, we used a constitutively active version of the MAPK created by fusing the upstream MAPK kinase \u2013 MEK1 \u2013 to ERK2 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Robinson et al., 1998</a>). To enable the kinase-substrate interaction we fused the mPDZ domain and PDZ ligand to the substrate and MAPK, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We also included a construct missing the heterologous targeting domains to make sure that targeting was not simply due to direct interactions mediated by sequence elements surrounding the phosphodegron. Since the strains constitutively expressed both the engineered kinase and target, we measured the steady-state YFP fluorescence via flow cytometry. In strains with the active kinase targeting the functional YFP reporter, fluorescence did not rise above background levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)\u2014suggesting that the substrate is actively targeted, phosphorylated and then degraded. Fluorescence was significantly higher in control strains where the interaction domain, the phosphodegron or both were missing or inactivated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These results indicate that the interaction domains and the phosphodegron are necessary and sufficient for retargeting the regulation of ERK2. Importantly, these results also strongly suggest that this rewiring approach is potentially applicable to a wide range of MAPKs."

To answer these questions, we targeted Fus3 to up- and downstream elements in the yeast mating cascade, including the kinase Ste7, the scaffold protein Ste5, and the transcription factor Ste12. We built a total of six yeast strains containing the synthetic kinase-substrate pairs.

However, we also note different fusion proteins are required for each experiment and that these protein modifications alone can result in changes of the pathway sensitivity\u2014e.g. by changing the concentrations of pathway components (<a href=\"#bib52\">O'Shaughnessy et al., 2011</a>). For example, the non-feedback controls in the three experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> have apparent Hill coefficients of n<sub>H</sub> =1.5, 1.6 and 2.1."

By putting the YFP-phosphodegron-mPDZ domain fusion protein under the control of the mating pathway-controllable promoter \u2013 pFUS1 \u2013\u00a0we created a simple incoherent feed-forward circuit regulated at the level of both transcription and translation. Such a \u2018type 3\u2019 incoherent feed-forward loop design can produce pulses and other behaviors, depending on the design parameters (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mangan and Alon, 2003</a>). A phenomenological model of a hybrid incoherent feed-forward loop is included in Appendix 1. We performed time-course experiments over a range of \u03b1-factor concentrations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In cells containing the feed-forward loop the fluorescent signal initially increased sharply as the \u03b1-factor concentration was increased from 0.1\u2009\u03bcM to ~1\u2009\u03bcM\u2014however, induction with concentrations of \u03b1-factor higher than 1\u2009\u03bcM resulted in decreasing levels of YFP fluorescence. The incoherent feed-forward loop thus created a concentration-based band-pass filter for the \u03b1-factor input. In a control where the phosphodegron fused to YFP was broken we observe the normal signal amplification behavior of the mating cascade (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>)\u2014thus, it is the targeted regulation of YFP by Fus3 that caused the band-pass-like behavior."

The addition of sets of two modular components is sufficient to rewire a MAPK to regulate any protein of interest\u2014a complementary set of protein interaction domains and a phosphodegron. Natively, MAPKs are co-localized with their substrates via an interaction between the docking peptide of a substrate and a set of residues on the surface of the MAPK; it has been hypothesized that this interaction may be necessary to catalytically unlock the kinase (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Heo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Zhou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Tokunaga et al., 2014</a>).

The proteomes of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and humans have ~3500 and &gt;50,000 phosphorylation sites, respectively (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hornbeck et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Beltrao et al., 2009</a>). The amino acid composition of the surrounding phospho-motifs is constrained by the residues in and around the kinase active site; as such their length is generally fairly short\u2014on the order of four amino acids on either side of the phosphorylated residue (<a href=\"#bib74\">Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007</a>). With such a short length, and given the degeneracy of the recognition requirements (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mok et al., 2010</a>), the probability that new phospho-motifs will appear by chance is high. Indeed, many human SNPs \u2013 both those associated with disease as well as apparently healthy individual variation \u2013 have been observed to create and destroy verified phospho-motifs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hornbeck et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Reimand and Bader, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ryu et al., 2009</a>)."

Given that both phospho-motifs and short, linear interaction peptides are degenerate, common and short it is interesting to consider what constrains the formation of a new, functional connection between a kinase and a substrate\u2014i.e. whether it is the formation of phospho-motifs or of protein-protein interactions that is rate limiting.

However, while our approach is a powerful tool it does have certain limitations. For instance, our system requires that a phosphodegron be known, and its cognate F-box be expressed for ubiquitination to occur. We demonstrate one way in which this problem may be addressed, i.e. by the design of new phosphodegrons based on the consensus sequences of the MAPK and F-box. Another consideration in any protein-engineering endeavor is the effect that various protein fusions have on expression\u2014indeed we noted in our experiments that fusion of additional domains to MAPKs or their substrates altered the expression levels. These altered expression levels affect the behavior of kinase cascades, and so a sufficiently diverse set of modules need to be defined and characterized to make the desired behavior(s) achievable. Thus, the scalability afforded by the use of modular interaction domains comes at the potential price of altered protein expression. In contrast, using docking domains for co-localization obviates engineering the kinase, but is not a scalable rewiring approach. Finally, more work is necessary to render other kinase families \u2018engineerable\u2019. Still the flexibility and scalability of kinase-substrate interactions demonstrated through our work lays a comprehensive foundation for future attempts to understand and re-engineer the signaling behavior of cells."

Here, we present a simple analytical model of the specific type 3 IFFL introduced in the main text, following an approach outlined by <a href=\"#bib67\">Shvartsman and Baker (2012)</a>. The purpose of this model is to provide an intuition for the origin of the bandpass behavior that we observed in our experiments, rather than to give a detailed mechanistic study of the actual signaling cascade. We only consider three species in our model, namely Fus3, Ste12 and GFP. Fus3 is activated (indirectly) by \u03b1-factor and phosphorylates Ste12. Phosphorylated Ste12 acts as a transcriptional activator for GFP. Through a synthetic interaction Fus3 also directly phosphorylates the Tec1 phosphodegron fused to GFP, triggering the degradation of GFP."

We use saturating functions to describe the phosphorylation and hence activation of Fus3 by \u03b1-factor and of Ste12 by Fus3. A similar function is used to model the production of GFP in response to Ste12. Degradation of GFP can be due to\u00a0the interaction with Fus3 or due to other causes and the two processes are modeled independently. The full model is given by:"

Here, the authors developed a new technique based on target phosphorylation motifs and protein interaction domains to engineer post-translational interactions between MAPK kinases and protein substrates. Using engineered pathways in yeast where a MAP kinase (Fus3 or Erk2) is targeted to artificial substrate protein through fusion of both the kinase and substrate to compatible interaction domains, they determine that this mode of interaction and the presence of the cognate phosphorylation motif (in this case a phosphodegron) is sufficient to confer MAPK regulation of the substrate (in this case leading to degradation). They used this technique to control ubiquitin-dependent degradation of fluorescent reporters (such as YFP) and to rewire signaling circuits in yeast both transcriptionally and post-translationally. The key findings include: 1) substrate phosphorylation by a MAPK kinase can be engineered in a highly modular fashion by combining two distinct modules (protein-protein interaction and phosphorylation motif); 2) the engineered phosphorylation can enable new signaling capabilities through feedback/feedforward loops. The technique is novel and is useful for dissecting natural signaling pathways as well as for synthesizing new signaling behaviors. In particular, it represents an exciting example of engineering a fully post-translational feedback loop in a signaling system, which makes this a major step forward from a synthetic biology point of view. The manuscript could be strengthened by consideration (and integration) of known mechanisms for docking interactions involving Fus3, and their role in regulating signal output (Remenyi et al. Mol Cell 2005)."

As discussed above, Regot et al. and Durandau et al. have described an approach wherein a kinase-specific docking domain can be used to direct a particular kinase to a new substrate\u2014a powerful tool for interrogating natural kinase signaling systems. However, the number of naturally occurring kinase-substrate docking interactions inherently limits the scalability of the approach. For example, a given kinase \u2018module\u2019 cannot be reused in parallel signaling pathways, because it would not be able to distinguish between downstream targets in 2 one pathway versus another. To overcome this limitation, it would be useful to be able to tease apart the \u2018targeting\u2019 module of the kinase from the \u2018enzymatic\u2019 module\u2014and likewise, the \u2018targeting\u2019 and \u2018effector\u2019 modules of the substrate.

There are two points where components of our system might compete for limiting resources. Since the two copies of Fus3 are overexpressed, they may compete for access to the endogenously expressed upstream MAPKK, Ste7. Likewise, the YFP and mCherry substrates might compete for access to the ubiquitin/proteasomal machinery. To test this we constructed strains that expressed our standard system \u2013 one kinase targeting one substrate \u2013 and added either a competing copy of Fus3 or a competing substrate (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). In both experiments we observed a diminished response in YFP degradation in the presence of the competitor. It should also be noted that the ABA-inducible interaction domains elicit a weaker degradation response compared to the mPDZ-PDZ ligand interaction (compare data in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). Thus, it is likely that a confluence of all these factors \u2013 saturation points as well as the less efficient ABA-induced interaction \u2013 contribute to the different levels of degradation observed for the mCherry and YFP reporters in this dual-targeting system."
