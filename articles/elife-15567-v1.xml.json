RESOLFT nanoscopy is particularly suited for live cell imaging because it requires relatively low light levels to overcome the diffraction barrier. Previously, we introduced the reversibly switchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2, which facilitated fast RESOLFT nanoscopy (<a href=\"#bib10\">Grotjohann et al., 2012</a>). In that study, as in most other nanoscopy studies, only cultivated single cells were analyzed. Here, we report on the use of rsEGFP2 for live-cell RESOLFT nanoscopy of sub-cellular structures of intact <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae and of resected tissues. We generated flies expressing fusion proteins of alpha-tubulin and rsEGFP2 highlighting the microtubule cytoskeleton in all cells. By focusing through the intact larval cuticle, we achieved lateral resolution of &lt;60 nm. RESOLFT nanoscopy enabled time-lapse recordings comprising 40 images and facilitated recordings 40 \u00b5m deep within fly tissues."

RESOLFT nanoscopy is particularly suited for live cell imaging because it requires relatively low light levels to overcome the diffraction barrier. Previously, we introduced the reversibly switchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2, which facilitated fast RESOLFT nanoscopy (<a href=\"#bib10\">Grotjohann et al., 2012</a>). In that study, as in most other nanoscopy studies, only cultivated single cells were analyzed. Here, we report on the use of rsEGFP2 for live-cell RESOLFT nanoscopy of sub-cellular structures of intact <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae and of resected tissues. We generated flies expressing fusion proteins of alpha-tubulin and rsEGFP2 highlighting the microtubule cytoskeleton in all cells. By focusing through the intact larval cuticle, we achieved lateral resolution of &lt;60 nm. RESOLFT nanoscopy enabled time-lapse recordings comprising 40 images and facilitated recordings 40 \u00b5m deep within fly tissues."

Indeed, nanoscopy of thick specimen is mostly performed on optically transparent samples such as cleared and fixed tissue (<a href=\"#bib20\">Stelzer, 2015</a>). The relatively few reported examples of nanoscopy in living tissues typically relied on specimen in which individual cells overexpressed a fluorescent protein (<a href=\"#bib19\">N\u00e4gerl et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Ch\u00e9reau et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berning et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Testa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">T\u00f8nnesen et al., 2014</a>)."

The green fluorescent rsEGFP2 can be reversible photo-switched between a fluorescent 'On-'\u00a0and a non-fluorescent 'Off-'state with light of ~405 nm and ~488 nm. rsEGFP2 was designed to be used within the framework of live-cell RESOLFT (reversible saturable optical fluorescence transition) nanoscopy (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brakemann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Grotjohann et al., 2011</a>).

Several variations of RESOLFT microscopy have been established, including single-beam and parallelized scanning approaches (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brakemann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chmyrov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Grotjohann et al., 2011</a>). The RESOLFT principle using RSFPs has also been extended to nonlinear structured illumination microscopy (PA NL-SIM) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Li et al., 2015</a>) and light sheet microscopy (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hoyer et al., 2016</a>). In RESOLFT, the scanned light pattern typically induces the transition into the Off-state, so that the On-state molecules are confined to a sub-diffraction volume. RESOLFT nanoscopy stands out from all other far-field super-resolution microscopies that overcome the diffraction barrier by the relatively low light dose that is required to achieve nanoscale resolution. The light intensities used are up to six orders of magnitude lower than those in STED-microscopy (<a href=\"#bib15\">Klar et al., 2000</a>) and are comparable to those typically applied in live-cell confocal fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#bib24\">W\u00e4ldchen et al., 2015</a>). Likewise, the total light dose impinging on the sample is lower by 3\u20134 orders of magnitude compared to stochastic single-molecule based nanoscopy approaches (<a href=\"#bib10\">Grotjohann et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, when implemented in a beam scanning approach, RESOLFT can be combined with confocal detection, which is particularly suitable for the imaging of highly fluorescent tissues because it rejects the out-of-focus fluorescence. Altogether, this suggests that RESOLFT microscopy is particularly suitable for live-cell imaging of complex samples such as tissues."

Confocal images of resected tissues from transgenic adult flies revealed a large variation of the arrangement of the microtubule cytoskeleton depending on the cell type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013J</a>). At 25\u00b0C, the half-time of the life span of these flies was ~41 days, similar to the isogenic wild type strain. The flies were propagated for more than 50 generations without detecting any loss in fitness. The fact that even during oogenesis and spermatogenesis the microtubule network was labelled (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>) suggests no adverse effects of the ubiquitous expression of rsEGFP2-\u03b1-tubulin on the embryogenesis and demonstrates the versatility of rsEGFP2 as a live-cell label. Western blots of larval protein extracts probed with antiserum against \u03b1-tubulin demonstrated that the fusion protein was expressed at moderate levels, so that the ratio of endogenous \u03b1-tubulin to rsEGFP2-\u03b1-tubulin was about 3:1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Images were recorded using a beam-scanning RESOLFT microscope. To unambiguously report the potential and current limitations of beam scanning RESOLFT, all microscopic images display only raw data with linear color maps and no background subtraction throughout the manuscript. All color maps including the actual photon counts are given in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. Deconvolution or any other mathematical image processing was not applied. To fairly compare a RESOLFT image with the best possible corresponding diffraction-limited image, we recorded the confocal image together with the RESOLFT image using the same pixel sizes and recording times by just omitting the switching off-step. We recorded RESOLFT images of various tissues including body wall muscles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>) and salivary glands (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), demonstrating a distinct improvement in resolution compared to the corresponding confocal images. The increased resolution is well exemplified in body wall muscle cells, where microtubules are frequently co-aligned over relatively long distances (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>)."

The confocal detection allows optical sectioning of the tissue. To make use of this property, we recorded 14 RESOLFT images of resected body wall muscle tissue with 250 nm axial distance between each image. Thereby one can track individual microtubules in the tissue volume (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), albeit at relatively poor axial resolution. In order to track the microtubules more reliably in 3D, we replaced the 2D-doughnut by a 3D-doughnut, which confines the On-state rsEGFP2 molcules in all room directions, thus increasing the resolution along the x,y, and z-axes.

In order to evaluate the strength of 2D-RESOLFT microscopy for imaging of sub-cellular structures buried in a highly fluorescent and scattering tissue, a wandering third instar larvae ubiquitously expressing rsEGFP2-\u03b1-tubulin was cut into half and the inverted front half of the larva was mounted in physiological Schneider\u2019s cell culture medium. We equipped the microscope with a silicone oil immersion objective in order to match the refractive index of the tissue. Still, the confocal images exhibited reduced signal-to-noise ratios already at an imaging depth of 10 \u00b5m due to the pronounced scattering in the tissue. This undesirable effect strengthened with increasing imaging depths such that at an imaging depth of 42 \u00b5m the rsEGFP2-\u03b1-tubulin labeled microtubules were barely discernible when imaged in the confocal mode (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

However, also at deeper cell layers, we resolved individual microtubule filaments with a substantially better signal-to-noise ratio than in the confocal case. We attribute this advantage of RESOLFT to the beneficial effect of transferring the rsEGFP2 molecules outside of the focus to a non-fluorescent state before probing the fluorescence, thus improving the contrast.\u00a0The resolution decreased with the penetration depth, but was always better than in the corresponding confocal images. Hence the RESOLFT mode allows retrieving image information deep within scattering and highly fluorescent tissue that is inaccessible by confocal microscopy."

Moreover, in samples that express the fusion proteins in all cells, very pronounced out-of-focus fluorescence may occur. To enable RESOLFT microscopy in intact larvae, living rsEGFP2-\u03b1-tubulin expressing second instar larvae were placed between two spacers that separated the object slide and the cover glass, forming a cavity filled with Schneider\u2019s cell culture media (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). By this, the overall movements of the larvae were largely restrained, although movements of body muscles still occurred. For RESOLFT imaging, we focused through the intact larval cuticle into the underlying tissue without any further treatment of the larvae. Despite the occasional movements of the larvae, we could reliably record RESOLFT images of the microtubule network in these intact animals. Co-aligned microtubules that were fully blurred in the corresponding confocal images could be resolved (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). As in resected tissues, the measured resolution in the intact larvae was also \u226460 nm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), despite the fact that we were focusing through the opaque cuticle into tissue. We conclude that RESOLFT imaging is feasible even on living larvae expressing rsEGFP2-fusion proteins without removing the cuticle and thus leaving the larvae entirely intact."

Importantly, we also did not observe phototoxic effects during imaging. We attribute this to the relatively low light intensities required in RESOLFT nanoscopy to overcome the diffraction barrier. Moreover, because of the utilized scanning approach, the individual irradiation times are short and consequently the overall light dose deposited in the imaged volume is small. Nonetheless, the light intensities in RESOLFT microscopy are still higher than what is sometimes regarded as critical intensity threshold in long-term imaging to follow developmental processes over hours or even days <a href=\"#bib20\">(Stelzer, 2015</a>). It should be noted, however, that in in vivo RESOLFT microscopy, typically only a very small part of the sample organism is imaged, whereas the remaining parts are not illuminated. Generally, the phototoxic effects that manifest themselves after the actual experiment are irrelevant as long as the cellular dynamics during the imaging are not disturbed."

Although in this manuscript we only show raw image data, the RESOLFT data could be deconvolved to increase the contrast and resolution even further if required. As shown here, the RESOLFT modality offers the benefit of allowing to image deeper in tissue. This observation relys on the fact that fluorescence from outside the focal region is precluded because the molecules located in that region are transferred into a non-fluorescent state; their signal cannot perturb the image."

Also organic dyes were used in this concept (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kwon et al., 2015</a>). Still, for the applications shown in this manuscript, namely beam scanning RESOLFT nanoscopy in tissues, rsEGFP2 seems to unite the necessary properties in the most suitable combination. Although rsEGFP2 dramatically outperforms earlier RSFPs such as Dronpa (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ando et al., 2004</a>) or rsEGFP (<a href=\"#bib9\">Grotjohann et al., 2011</a>), we expect generation of superior RSFPs in the future that are even more photostable, brighter, and exhibit better contrast."

For RESOLFT imaging of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the following switching scheme was applied to the sample at each scanning position: First, rsEGFP2 proteins were switched into the on-state with light of 405 nm. Second, rsEGFP2 proteins in the periphery of the focal spot were switched off using a 488 nm doughnut-shaped beam. The 2D-doughnut was realized by using a phase plate, whereas the 3D-doughnut was generated by using a spatial light modulator. Third, on-state fluorophores at the center of the spot were read out with a Gaussian shaped beam of 488 nm light. We introduced a short 5 \u00b5s break between each step. The RESOLFT images were recorded with or without line accumulation depending on the signal intensity. A detailed listing of the laser powers, switching times, line accumulations and scanning step sizes of all RESOLFT images shown are provided in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>.

However, in vivo fluorescence nanoscopy has been challenging because it requires fast imaging speed and minimal photodamage. In this aspect, RESOLFT nanoscopy is a very promising tool due to its low dosage of illumination although its imaging speed is somewhat slower than STED microscopy. RESOLFT uses lower doses than STED as well as PALM/STORM techniques and filters out out-of-focus light with the pinhole of the confocal scanning geometry. This combination, in concert with fluorescent proteins, makes it the best-suited super-resolution technique for in vivo imaging. In this manuscript, the authors present significant advances over their 2012 <i>eLife</i> publication on the development of rsEGFP2 as a genetically encodable RESOLFT probe and its application in live-cell RESOLFT nanoscopy."

To this end, we imaged a tissue volume of 4.2 \u00b5m x 3.9 \u00b5m x 3.5 \u00b5m and took 14 xy RESOLFT images, each separated by 250 nm.

Of these, the rsEGFP/rsEGFP2 variants rsFolder (El Khatib et al. 2016), rsGreen (Duwe et al. 2015), and rsEGFP-N205S (Chmyrov et al. 2013), the red fluorescent rsCherryRev1.4 (Lavoie-Cardinal et al. 2014), and the positive switching Kohinoor (Tiwari et al. 2015) have been successfully used in RESOLFT nanoscopy. Also organic dyes were used in this concept (Kwon et al. 2015). Still, for the applications shown in this manuscript, namely beam scanning RESOLFT nanoscopy in tissues, rsEGFP2 seems to unite the necessary properties in the most suitable combination. Although rsEGFP2 dramatically outperforms earlier RSFPs such as Dronpa (Ando, Mizuno, and Miyawaki 2004) or rsEGFP (Grotjohann et al. 2011), we expect generation of superior RSFPs in the future that are even more photostable, brighter, and exhibit better contrast.\u201d"

How would you compare the current RESOLFT nanoscopy with PA NL-SIM microscopy for in vivo imaging? It would be great to briefly address it in the main text.</i> "

Indeed, the shown RESOLFT microscopy and PA NL-SIM are highly related as both approaches rely on the reversible switching of RSFPs to overcome the diffraction barrier. However, the technical implementations are different, as PA NL-SIM relies on structured illumination and widefield detection and our RESOLFT approach on focused excitation and confocal detection. Therefore, we think that it would be rather challenging to implement PA NL-SIM for highly fluorescent tissues."
