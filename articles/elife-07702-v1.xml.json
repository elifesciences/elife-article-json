To directly test that premise, we humanized the zebrafish p53 pathway by introducing regulatory and coding sequences of the human tumor suppressor <i>ARF</i> into the zebrafish genome. <i>ARF</i> was dormant during development, in uninjured adult fins, and during wound healing, but was highly expressed in the blastema during epimorphic fin regeneration after amputation. Regenerative, but not developmental signals resulted in binding of zebrafish E2f to the human <i>ARF</i> promoter and activated conserved ARF-dependent Tp53 functions. The context-dependent activation of ARF did not affect growth and development but inhibited regeneration, an unexpected distinct tumor suppressor response to regenerative versus developmental environments. The antagonistic pleiotropic characteristics of <i>ARF</i> as both tumor and regeneration suppressor imply that inducing epimorphic regeneration clinically would require modulation of ARF \u2013p53 axis activation."

To directly test that premise, we humanized the zebrafish p53 pathway by introducing regulatory and coding sequences of the human tumor suppressor <i>ARF</i> into the zebrafish genome. <i>ARF</i> was dormant during development, in uninjured adult fins, and during wound healing, but was highly expressed in the blastema during epimorphic fin regeneration after amputation. Regenerative, but not developmental signals resulted in binding of zebrafish E2f to the human <i>ARF</i> promoter and activated conserved ARF-dependent Tp53 functions. The context-dependent activation of ARF did not affect growth and development but inhibited regeneration, an unexpected distinct tumor suppressor response to regenerative versus developmental environments. The antagonistic pleiotropic characteristics of <i>ARF</i> as both tumor and regeneration suppressor imply that inducing epimorphic regeneration clinically would require modulation of ARF \u2013p53 axis activation."

Hesse et al. introduced the human <i>ARF</i> gene into zebrafish to investigate whether it has any effect on tissue regeneration. The experiments show that <i>ARF</i> is silent in growing and uninjured fish, but it is activated when it detects regeneration occurring after an injury. <i>ARF</i> drastically inhibits this process to the point that fish with the <i>ARF</i> gene cannot regenerate damaged tissue. The findings suggest that <i>ARF</i> mistakenly identifies regeneration as the formation of a tumor; therefore therapies that aim to induce regeneration in people may need to control the activity of this gene."

For example, zebrafish fin regeneration proceeds through steps that include wound healing, blastema formation, and regenerative outgrowth to faithfully restore preinjury structures and size of the fin (<a href=\"#bib10\">Poss et al., 2003</a>). In such highly regenerative species, the blastema consists of a heterogeneous pool of highly proliferative mesenchymal cells that gives rise to the large amount of new tissue in the regenerate (<a href=\"#bib57\">Knopf et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Tu and Johnson, 2011</a>). In contrast, absence of a proliferative blastema is a prominent feature of most mammalian solid tissue injury responses (<a href=\"#bib22\">Muneoka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Straube and Tanaka, 2006</a>). An open question in biology is how cellular mechanisms controlling proliferation affect the blastema and whether they have evolved to contribute to divergent regenerative capacities among vertebrate species."

                        "text": "Tumor suppressor genes control the proliferative and differentiated state of cells, and many are also developmental regulators critical for normal formation of tissues (<a href=\"#bib55\">Jacks et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Berman et al., 2008</a>). The complex and precisely controlled proliferation and differentiation that occurs during epimorphic regeneration likely requires similar machinery, and as a group, tumor suppressors are probably necessary for well-orchestrated regeneration to occur (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pomerantz and Blau, 2013</a>). For example, in eukaryotes the retinoblastoma gene <i>Rb1</i> regulates the G1/S transition by sequestering E2f transcription factors, and it controls cellular differentiation by associating with chromatin modifiers to regulate activity of tissue-specific transcription factors. Therefore, the role of <i>Rb1 </i>in tumor suppression is likely less important from an evolutionary standpoint than its ancient broad functions in regulating cellular differentiation and tissue formation. In contrast, the mammalian gene <i>Cdkn2a</i> is an essential tumor suppressor in mice and humans, but it is dispensable for mammalian development and tissue formation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Serrano et al., 1996</a>). In mammals, <i>Cdkn2a </i>encodes two structurally unrelated proteins translated via alternate reading frames, p16Ink4a and Arf, each of which is a tumor suppressor (<a href=\"#bib40\">Chin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Sherr, 2006</a>). While p16Ink4a is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) that functions upstream of Rb1, Arf exerts its tumor suppressor function by responding to inappropriate Rb pathway signaling above a presumed threshold (<a href=\"#bib8\">Lowe and Sherr, 2003</a>). When induced, it stabilizes and activates Tp53 by binding and sequestering Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and negative regulator of Tp53 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pomerantz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Weber et al., 1999</a>). Depending on the context, stabilized Tp53 either promotes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In addition to canonical Tp53-dependent functions, Arf has other important functions including controlling ribosome biogenesis and responding to oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib17\">Sherr, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Weber et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Damalas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Menendez et al., 2003</a>). The resulting general function of Arf is to maintain the postmitotic state, and we have previously shown that suppression of Arf in the context of compromise of the Rb pathway results in dedifferentiation and proliferation of mammalian muscle cells in culture (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pajcini et al., 2010</a>). Unlike in development or in regeneration of epithelial and hematopoietic tissues, reversal of the postmitotic state and dedifferentiation also occur in lower vertebrate epimorphic regeneration scenarios that involve a blastema. Regulation of Tp53 has recently been shown to be important during epimorphic regeneration, where it is downregulated during blastema formation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Yun et al., 2013</a>). Although cell cycle reentry of postmitotic cells and dedifferentiation are characteristics of malignant transformation which tumor suppressor mechanisms oppose, why these two processes are permitted to occur in the context of intact tumor suppressor mechanisms during epimorphic regeneration is unknown."

The advent of somatic stem cells in metazoans is thought to have enabled the formation of new types of cancer, thus requiring advanced tumor suppressor mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib35\">Belyi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Pearson and Sanchez Alvarado, 2008</a>). Among metazoan species, including vertebrates, selective pressures such as different physiologies and environmental exposures undoubtedly continue to apply pressure to generate species-specific tumor suppressor repertoires. For some tumor suppressor genes such as <i>Tp53</i>, multiple family members have evolved to carry out certain differentiation functions separately from tumor suppression. For others, such as <i>Arf</i>, a single member has evolved and exists in a limited number of species. Whether such differences in turn relate to distinct regenerative capacities remains unknown."

The <i>Cdkn2a/b</i> locus of teleost fish, including zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) and fugu (<i>Takifugu rubripes</i>) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Gilley and Fried, 2001</a>), exists as a single protein-producing unit that only encodes for a CKI. During evolution, <i>Cdkn2a</i> and <i>Cdkn2b</i> developed into two separate but related genes encoding for biochemically related CKIs. Arf is not a CKI and is not closely related to either Cdkn2a or Cdkn2b. Arf is thought to be the product of a genetic duplication caused by either an insertion or transposition into the <i>Cdkn2a/b</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib50\">Gil and Peters, 2006</a>). Of the highly regenerative species for which genomes have been completely sequenced, none possess an ortholog of <i>Arf </i>(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Flicek et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Karolchik et al., 2014</a>).

In mammals, ARF expression is regulated by a promoter that contains several putative E2F binding sites, and <i>ARF</i> expression can be regulated by free E2F levels above a threshold (<a href=\"#bib50\">Gil and Peters, 2006</a>). The ARF promoter has previously been empirically defined (<a href=\"#bib60\">del Arroyo et al., 2007</a>) and no other regulatory sequences or enhancers have been described to date. We first confirmed that the human <i>ARF</i> promoter can function in zebrafish cells <i></i><i>in vitro</i> in transfection experiments using previously described firefly luciferase reporter constructs (<a href=\"#bib60\">del Arroyo et al., 2007</a>). Experiments were performed with ZF4 and zebrafish kidney stromal (ZKS) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Stachura et al., 2009</a>) cells with HeLa cells used as a positive control since they express high levels of endogenous ARF (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These assays confirmed that the 736 base pair (bp) promoter is active in HeLa cells and in zebrafish lines. Therefore, we chose the 736\u00a0bp genomic fragment encompassing the human <i>ARF</i> promoter to generate <i>ARF </i>transgenics that mimic regulation of the human <i>ARF</i> gene. Tol2-mediated transgenesis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kwan et al., 2007</a>) was used to generate <i>ARF</i>:GFP fish, and transgenic fish were detected using cardiac GFP expression driven by a separate <i>cmlc2</i>:GFP cassette on the transgene."

To investigate the specific factors that activate <i>ARF</i> during zebrafish fin regeneration, but not during development, we assessed Rb pathway inhibition by Western blot analysis of E2f1, Rb1, and hyperphosophorylated-Rb1 (p-Rb1) in developing embryos (72 hpf), in adult uninjured fin tissue (uninj.) and at 2 days postamputation (dpa). Whereas p-Rb1 levels were relatively low in uninjured adult fins, a modest increase was detected in 72 hpf embryos. However, 2 dpa regenerates contained a dramatic increase in p-Rb1 levels despite stable levels of total Rb1 and total E2f1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This reflects a high level of pro-proliferation signaling resulting in inactivation of Rb1 by phosphorylation, as occurs commonly in tumors. To further investigate where in the regenerating fin the changes in p-Rb1 phosphorylation occurred, immunostaining of regenerating and uninjured fins was performed. Similar to Western blot analysis, immunostaining revealed a dramatic increase in p-Rb1 staining during regeneration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). A small amount of p-Rb1 staining was observed in uninjured fins, which is most likely the result of homeostatic proliferation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wills et al., 2008</a>).

The ChIP assay showed that binding of the <i>ARF </i>promoter by E2f1 was enriched over sixfold relative to non-amputated controls and the <i>tk1-</i> control. The <i>ARF</i> promoter was even more highly enriched than the <i>tk1+ </i> control. Despite the modestly increased p-Rb1 levels in 72 hpf embryos, which correlated with enrichment of E2f1 at the <i>tk1</i> promoter, no increase in E2f1 binding of the <i>ARF</i> promoter was observed. This finding suggests that the <i>ARF </i>promoter responds strongly and specifically to suprathreshold free E2f1 levels present during regeneration as opposed to other physiological contexts.

The induction and stabilization of p53 and induction of <i>cdkn1a</i> transcripts by ARF showed that ARF impacts p53 functions <i></i><i>in vivo</i> in fish regenerates. To assess the Tp53-dependence of ARF, we first crossed <i>hs</i>:ARF fish with <i>tp53<sup>M214K</sup></i> mutant fish to generate <i>hs</i>:ARF fish that are homozygous for the tp53<sup>M214K</sup> allele (<i>hs</i>:ARF; <i>tp53<sup>M214K/M214K</sup></i>). The tp53<sup>M214K</sup> mutation abrogates Tp53 transactivation functions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Berghmans et al., 2005</a>). Using the same amputation and heat shock regimen, we analyzed fin regeneration and found no difference in regenerate length or area despite ARF expression in <i>tp53</i> mutant fish (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We also tested Tp53-dependence of ARF regeneration suppression by treating zebrafish with either pifithrin-\u03b1 (PFT\u03b1Sigma, St. Louis, MO), an inhibitor of Tp53 transactivation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Komarov et al., 1999</a>), or nutlin3a, a molecule that disrupts the Mdm2\u2013Tp53 interaction, thereby stabilizing Tp53 levels (<a href=\"#bib32\">Yun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Vassilev et al., 2004</a>). Treatment of <i>hs</i>:ARF and WT fish with 5 \u03bcM PFT\u03b1 and heat shock increased <i>hs</i>:ARF regenerate length from 0.44 \u00b1 0.04 mm to 0.66 \u00b1 0.08 mm, an increase of 50% (p&lt;0.01), and area from 1.8 \u00b1 0.7 mm<sup>2</sup> to 3.2 \u00b1 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, an increase of approximately 75% (p&lt;0.05), compared with carrier-treated controls. Fin regeneration of WT fish was not affected by PFT\u03b1 treatments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Treatment of WT fish with 5 \u03bcM nutlin3a reduced fin regenerate length from approximately 0.65 \u00b1 0.1 mm to 0.45 \u00b1 0.1 mm, a decrease of 30% (p&lt;0.01), and area from 4.7 \u00b1 1.2 mm<sup>2</sup> to 2.8 \u00b1 0.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, a reduction of 40% (p&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, left), phenocopying the fin regeneration inhibition phenotype of induced <i>hs</i>:ARF fish (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, right). Together, these experiments show that ARF functions through Tp53-dependent mechanisms to inhibit fin regeneration, and also demonstrate the importance of active suppression of Tp53 by Mdm2."

To do so, we generated zebrafish lines from independent transgenic insertions that utilize the human <i>ARF</i> promoter to drive ARF expression (Tg (<i>ARF</i>:ARF) or <i>ARF</i>:ARF) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, left). ARF expression during development would be expected to adversely affect <i>ARF</i>:ARF fish. We observed, however, that <i>ARF</i>:ARF transgenic fish are viable, develop normally, and have no overt size or morphological differences when compared with age- and sex-matched WT counterparts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, right). Furthermore, examination of <i>ARF</i>:ARF embryos confirmed our findings in <i>ARF</i>:GFP transgenics. In agreement with the predictions of <i>ARF</i>:GFP experiments, there was no effect of the <i>ARF</i>:ARF transgene on survival during early embryogenesis compared with WT fish (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also did not detect ARF expression in embryos, as expected given our findings with <i>ARF</i>:GFP fish (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To assess whether ARF, if expressed, would interfere with organogenesis or development, we evaluated the effects of induced ARF expression using <i>hs</i>:ARF fish. Upon heat shock, <i>hs</i>:ARF, but not WT clutches, exhibited drastically reduced survival that was associated with high levels of ARF expression throughout the embryo (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This finding indicates that ARF expression is very poorly tolerated by developing embryos and clearly implies that in <i>ARF</i>:ARF fish, ARF is not activated significantly during development to affect normal developmental growth and organogenesis."

This new example of antagonistic pleiotropy adds to previously recognized trade-off characteristics of tumor suppressor genes affecting mammalian stem cell function (<a href=\"#bib14\">Pardal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Greaves, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pomerantz and Blau, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Rodier et al., 2007</a>) and shows that <i>ARF</i> antagonistic properties also manifest in the context of the blastema. The evidence that ARF is a critical tumor suppressor in mammals (<a href=\"#bib17\">Sherr, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">Sharpless, 2005</a>), but opposes regeneration functions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sharpless and DePinho, 2007</a>), suggests that the selective pressure that has driven the evolution of <i>ARF</i> has primarily enhanced tumor suppression either at the expense of or in the absence of regeneration pressures. Although our experiments and those of others (<a href=\"#bib49\">Gemberling et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Poss et al., 2003</a>) show that the regenerative capacity of zebrafish is vulnerable to single gene alterations, whether altering function of a single gene in mammals would induce the emergence of robust epimorphic regenerative capacity is a much more complex issue. Indeed, the multifactorial genetic differences of highly and less regenerative vertebrates make it unlikely that manipulation of a single gene could enable regeneration. It is notable, however, that <i>Cdkn1a (p21</i>) knockout mice do possess a somewhat enhanced ability to regenerate solid structures (<a href=\"#bib54\">Heber-Katz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Clark et al., 1998</a>) such as pinnae, which lack the complex tissue structure of a digit, but nonetheless, demonstrate that alteration of cellular growth control mechanisms can impact regeneration. Moreover, the importance of active repression of <i>ARF</i> to maintain stem cell function (<a href=\"#bib13\">Molofsky et al., 2005</a>), and of <i>ARF</i> reduction to facilitate dedifferentiation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pajcini et al., 2010</a>) have been documented."

By contrast, <i>Tp53, Pten, </i>and<i> Ink4a </i>have distant orthologs, present in invertebrates and vertebrates alike. The transgenesis approach we used to study ARF in fin regeneration made it possible for us to study ARF with its human regulatory components but without increasing <i>CDKN2A</i> CKI gene dosage, which could have been a complicating factor in a transgenic harboring the entire <i>CDKN2A (INK4A/ARF)</i> locus. This study extends our previous observations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pajcini et al., 2010</a>) that ARF prevents dedifferentiation in muscle cells in culture and provides new evidence that ARF functions <i></i><i>in vivo</i> to oppose tissue regeneration. Future experiments will determine whether ARF prevents dedifferentiation <i></i><i>in vivo</i>, such as the dedifferentiation of osteoblasts in regenerating fins, or whether it acts on proliferating blastema cells after they have dedifferentiated. Combined, our findings suggest that zebrafish cells are more promiscuous in terms of tolerance to high levels of mitogenic activity, thus permitting the cellular processes required for epimorphic regeneration. It follows that regenerating cells in organisms that have an <i>ARF</i> gene would need to prevent ARF activation or would be inherently more restricted in these activities."

                        "text": "We found that ARF recapitulates its core mammalian mechanistic functions in zebrafish cells and tissues. As in mammals, when ARF is overexpressed in zebrafish cells, it associates with Mdm2, stabilizes Tp53, and induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. This functional conservation over an evolutionary distance demonstrates that cross-species genetic variations can be experimentally examined in the study of regeneration. When ARF expression is driven by its endogenous human promoter in zebrafish cells, activation of the p53 axis occurs specifically in the blastema-regeneration scenario. Remarkably, the inhibitory effect on regeneration by <i>ARF</i>:ARF was stronger than with the heat shock promoter, probably reflecting ongoing surveillance of regenerative signals by the <i>ARF</i> promoter in contrast to fluctuating ARF levels obtained with intermittent heat shock induction of a short half-life protein. In the developing or adult uninjured state, E2f1 is sequestered and inhibited by Rb1, and <i>ARF</i> is inactive. However, during blastema formation and regeneration, Rb1 hyperphosphorylation is associated with sufficient free E2f1 to activate <i>ARF</i>, which inhibits fin regeneration via a Tp53-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Our findings and model are in agreement with the recent proposal that in salamanders the absence of ARF permits downregulation of Tp53 during blastema formation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Yun et al., 2013</a>). The responsiveness of <i>ARF</i> to the Rb pathway proliferative signaling characteristic of zebrafish fin regeneration implies that similar mitogenic signaling occurring in a mammalian context would be detected as aberrant, activate ARF\u2013MDM2\u2013TP53 tumor suppressor mechanisms, and oppose regeneration. Our findings are compatible with previous mouse studies showing that ARF is a potent tumor suppressor that is dispensable for normal development (<a href=\"#bib59\">Serrano et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Kamijo et al., 1997</a>). Moreover, prior observations that <i>ARF</i> is not developmentally expressed in the majority of tissues in the mouse (<a href=\"#bib52\">Gromley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Zindy et al., 2003</a>) support the fidelity of the promoter used in this study. Although the majority of tumor suppressors probably function in regeneration as they do in normal development, the findings of the present study indicate that <i>ARF</i> represents an unusual departure from that paradigm in that the properties that cause it to respond specifically to tumorigenesis also cause it to distinguish regeneration contexts from developmental ones."

Fin regenerate length was calculated by averaging the length of the longest dorsal and ventral fin ray from the amputation plane. Caudal fin wounding experiments were performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib47\">Gauron et al., 2013</a>)."

They showed that a 735 bp ARF promoter fragment drives transgene expression during fin regeneration, but not noticeably during development. Their analysis suggests that E2F1, which might be de-repressed by hyperphosphorylated-Rb1, binds ARF promoter. Next, they examined ARF protein function during fin regeneration, using a heat-shock-inducible ARF overexpression transgenic line. ARF introduction slowed fin regeneration, an effect that is partially suppressed by p53 loss-of-function mutation or inhibition of p53 activity. Furthermore, they find that ectopic expression of ARF driven by the human ARF promoter fragment inhibits fin regeneration. Overall, they provide evidence that a tumor suppressor gene ARF that is not present in zebrafish can impact regeneration, and that the Rb-E2F-ARF-p53 axis is functionally conserved among vertebrate species."

Since ARF does not normally exist in fish, it was unclear whether the Rb/p53 pathway is mechanistically conserved to the degree required to recapitulate ARF functions when introduced into that species. Therefore, in contrast to most other tumor suppressors, which have conserved orthologues in fish and other vertebrates, the possibility of studying the impact of ARF on regenerative capacity over evolutionary distances was unclear and turned out to be feasible. We agree that driving other tumor suppressors using strong inducible or constitutive promoters during regeneration would in general be expected to inhibit the proliferation dependent aspects of the process. However, some tumor suppressors such as Rb or Hippo, which are essential for tissue formation and differentiation are probably required for effective regeneration, and modulation could conceivably enhance regeneration, a line of experimentation which merits investigation in our opinion.
