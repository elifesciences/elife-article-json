Mutant huntingtin is known to aggregate, a process that can be inhibited by the eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (TCP1-ring complex) in vitro and in vivo. A structural understanding of the genesis of aggregates and their modulation by cellular chaperones could facilitate the development of therapies but has been hindered by the heterogeneity of amyloid aggregates. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and single particle cryo-electron tomography (SPT) we characterize the growth of fibrillar aggregates of mutant huntingtin exon 1 containing an expanded polyglutamine tract with 51 residues (mhttQ51), and resolve 3-D structures of the chaperonin TRiC interacting with mhttQ51. We find that TRiC caps mhttQ51 fibril tips via the apical domains of its subunits, and also encapsulates smaller mhtt oligomers within its chamber. These two complementary mechanisms provide a structural description for TRiC\u2019s inhibition of mhttQ51 aggregation in vitro."

Mutant huntingtin is known to aggregate, a process that can be inhibited by the eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (TCP1-ring complex) in vitro and in vivo. A structural understanding of the genesis of aggregates and their modulation by cellular chaperones could facilitate the development of therapies but has been hindered by the heterogeneity of amyloid aggregates. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and single particle cryo-electron tomography (SPT) we characterize the growth of fibrillar aggregates of mutant huntingtin exon 1 containing an expanded polyglutamine tract with 51 residues (mhttQ51), and resolve 3-D structures of the chaperonin TRiC interacting with mhttQ51. We find that TRiC caps mhttQ51 fibril tips via the apical domains of its subunits, and also encapsulates smaller mhtt oligomers within its chamber. These two complementary mechanisms provide a structural description for TRiC\u2019s inhibition of mhttQ51 aggregation in vitro."

These aggregates originate from a mutation in the huntingtin gene that causes an expansion of glutamine (Q) repeats in the huntingtin protein (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zoghbi and Orr, 2009</a>). This polyglutamine expansion (Q&gt;36) contributes to mutant huntingtin\u2019s (mhtt) tendency to aggregate within the cell (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nekooki-Machida et al., 2009</a>). Variants of mhtt exon1 containing an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract greater than 36 residues are commonly used as models to investigate mutant huntingtin\u2019s properties in vitro and in vivo. Understanding how polyQ aggregation is modulated by cellular factors, including molecular chaperones, might lead to therapeutic strategies to treat polyQ pathogenesis. Some chaperones, such as the eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC, are key regulators of protein aggregation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Muchowski and Wacker, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Liebman and Meredith, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Voisine et al., 2010</a>). In fact, TRiC modulates and suppresses polyglutamine aggregation, including that of mhtt variants having polyQ tracts of different length. TRiCs inhibition of mhtt aggregation has been biochemically characterized for several variants both in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kitamura et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tam et al., 2006</a>)."

However, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) can preserve specimens in close-to-solution conformations because the samples remain frozen-hydrated without chemical fixation or staining during the entire microscopy session (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dubochet et al., 1988</a>). Additionally, cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) allows for visualization of entire protein aggregates in 3-D. Furthermore, 3-D subtomogram processing approaches (<a href=\"#bib40\">Walz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00f6hm et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartesaghi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">F\u00f6rster et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Schmid and Booth, 2008</a>), also known as single particle tomography (SPT), have facilitated the determination of the structure of heterogeneous specimens by classifying and averaging subvolumes containing a 3-D view of individual macromolecular complexes, potentially with different conformations and compositions. Indeed, SPT is an emerging technique in structural biology that can resolve the structure of heterogeneous macromolecular complexes at nanometer resolution."

Conversely, about half of the distinguishable fibril tips seem clearly capped by TRiC, but many tips (capped or uncapped) might be obscured by the dense tangles, or may exist as short stubs budding from the side of thicker fibers, which might not be discernible. In fact, given the low signal to noise ratio (S/N) of individual tomograms, their inherently anisotropic resolution, and \u2018missing wedge\u2019 distortions present in all cryoET data, it is challenging to visually discern all TRiC molecules and mhtt fibril tips that might be present in our crowded fibrillar tangles.

This represented about one quarter of 1216 TRiC subvolumes extracted from all our mhtt-TRiC tomograms combined. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> shows examples of fibril-bound TRiC averages using subvolumes from separate tomograms. Although the heterogeneity of our fibril-bound TRiC sets precluded them from converging to a single structure and thwarted the determination of specific binding sites between TRiC and mhttQ51 fibrils, all our datasets yielded consistent barrel-shaped averages clearly resembling TRiC, with extra mass at the ends of the barrel. These extra densities are attributable to conformational averages of heterogeneous mhttQ51 fibrils. A few averages suggest a mode in which the fibrils might bind predominantly to the tip of a single CCT subunit, while others show mass splayed across the ring, making additional contacts."

Our aggregation and suppression of aggregation reactions followed well characterized conditions, previously described using filter trap assays that detect mhttQ51 amyloid aggregates (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tam et al., 2006</a>). The mhtt concentration in our experiments was chosen to allow mhtt aggregation to occur in a reasonably short time in the absence of TRiC (<a href=\"#bib31\">Scherzinger et al., 1999</a>), and the ratio of TRiC to mhtt was chosen to yield initial-stage fibril aggregates and yet thwart large-aggregate growth (<a href=\"#bib3\">Behrends et al., 2006</a>). It is worth noting however that the TRiC:mhtt ratio under normal physiological conditions has not been carefully explored. Nonetheless, increasing cellular levels of TRiC has a beneficial effect in suppressing mhtt toxicity and aggregation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Behrends et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kitamura et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tam et al., 2006</a>)."

It is therefore likely that the binding we demonstrate here between mhttQ51 fibrils and TRiC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1\u20133</a>), which thwarts the progression of fibers into sheaves, may involve mhttQ51 hydrophobic moieties that include the N17 domain. Interestingly, this domain has been proposed to function as a \u2018molecular switch\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Greiner and Yang, 2011</a>) controlled by multiple post-translational modifications that can determine the fate of mhtt exon-1 either by rendering it innocuous or enhancing its pathogenicity.

On the other hand, internalization of smaller mhttQ51 oligomers would also contribute to inhibition of sheaf formation by decreasing the effective concentration of oligomers in the reaction mixture. Our freestanding TRiC averages, free from template and symmetry bias (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), reveal a subpopulation with extra density inside the chaperonin\u2019s cavity. Although other substrates have also been shown to bind deep inside the cavity of apo-TRiC (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2011</a>), the finding that mhtt exon-1 might also be encapsulated is unprecedented. While it is conceivable for native substrates to be copurified with apo-TRiC, their presence within the chaperonin\u2019s cavity is rare. For instance, our controls show that extra density is only detectable in \u223c10% of the particles in the absence of added mhtt. On the other hand, we see significant extra density in \u223c40\u201350% of the freestanding TRiC particles from our TRiC + mhtt tomograms. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that TRiC does not bind GST (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feldman et al., 2003</a>). Therefore, it is unlikely that either native substrates or the GST moiety that is cleaved from mhttQ51 to initiate aggregation could account for the internalized mass we observe (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5B and 8</a>).

For fibril-bound TRiC, we visually inspected the new averages generated in each iteration to find representative examples of structures with extra density at the ends of the chaperonin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For each freestanding TRiC population (cavity-empty and cavity-occupied) as well as control TRiCs, we allowed HAC to converge to one final average of all the particles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>).

The average from each of the two highest quintiles had an empty cavity, while the cavity for each average from the two lowest quintiles contained a large density. The average from the middle quintile was neither clearly empty nor significantly occupied; therefore, we did not subject those subtomograms to further analysis. We made a final cavity-empty set from the two top quintiles and a final cavity-occupied set from the two bottom quintiles, each with 356 subtomograms. That is, each freestanding set (cavity-empty and cavity-occupied) was comprised of 40% of all freestanding TRiCs.

The displacement between the histograms using mask B is also statistically significant beyond a 99.9% confidence interval (CI), and the difference is much larger according to the <i>t</i>-value. This means that the difference between the particles in each group is very large when only the cavity is considered. Lastly, there was no significant displacement between the histograms using mask C, as confirmed by its low <i>t</i>-value, far below the 95% CI value. This means that when the cavity is excluded, the particles in each group are not significantly different. Therefore, our analyses show that the statistically significant differences between the cavity-empty and cavity-occupied TRiC sets are due to the central chamber of the chaperonin rather than the chaperonin itself. This validated our classification and justified further processing the cavity-empty group independently from the cavity-occupied one."

Therefore, we applied a hollow-template-guided approach to further localize the inner mass within the chamber of the cavity-occupied TRiC average. This consisted of aligning the raw cavity-occupied TRiCs to a hollow D8 symmetric apo-TRiC reference (<a href=\"#bib5\">Booth et al., 2008</a>) to generate an initial average. We then seeded iterative refinement of the raw subtomograms using this initial average. During all the iterations, the particles were masked to include only the cavity and were allowed only to visit D8 related orientations. Since the first round of alignment was against the D8 reference, restricting subsequent iterations to visit D8-related positions preserved the initial alignment of the particles against the reference while allowing the internal density to converge within the frame of TRiC after 17 iterations. While this procedure localized the internalized density in our cavity-occupied average, it had little effect on the cavity of the cavity-empty set. Of note, the \u2018dip\u2019 in the overall shape of the rotational correlation plot for the cavity-occupied average with the localized density can be explained by the presence of a large mass inside (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Applying the same classification and processing strategy to fibril-bound and control TRiCs as applied to freestanding TRiC did not yield any averages with comparable density inside the cavity."

We calculated the mean density inside this mask and multiplied this value by the volume of the mask. This yielded the final total mass of TRiC (without the cavity) in arbitrary units. Then we applied a mask to the difference map between the final cavity-empty average (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and the final cavity-occupied average (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) that would include the region of the cavity only.

The average density of the histogram from the cavity-empty group (blue) was considered to be \u2018background\u2019, in arbitrary units. Therefore, we subtracted this value from the average of the cavity-occupied histogram (green). This final value for average density in the cavity region in arbitrary units should be proportional to the average mass of encapsulated oligomers. Knowing the actual mass of TRiC (\u223c950 kDa) allowed for the scaling of masses in arbitrary units, yielding a value of \u223c65 kDa for the mass within the cavity.

On the other hand, the plot dips at azimuth equal to 180\u00b0 for the cavity-occupied average (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The first peak is bound to be higher in any rotational correlation plot because self-correlation will always be at its maximum when no rotations have occurred (all voxels in the volume correlate well; even those beyond the molecule but within the box). The difference in height (or correlation) between the next two highest peaks (two and eight) with the middle peak (five) in the rotational correlation plot of the cavity-occupied average arises from the mass of the encapsulated density: when the mass coincides perfectly with its copy, there is high correlation; when it is in opposite alignment to itself, the correlation dips. Therefore, using the mass of TRiC (\u223c950 kDa) to scale this difference indicates a substrate size of \u223c50 kDA. This is slightly underestimated, since the difference would ideally be calculated between the first and the middle peaks, but the first peak is unusable due to the perfect correlation of all voxels at the default position before any rotations occur."

However, these can vary widely depending on many factors such as polyQ length, tissue of expression, and stage of the disease, etc. Furthermore, in the cell TRiC and htt (and mhtt) interact with additional partners, which would change the effective concentrations available for their interaction. The ratio we used in this study yields the same beneficial effects of TRiC over-expression in mhtt transfected cells, i.e., the growth of aggregates is inhibited. Importantly, the TRiC and mhtt conditions used here reproduce the chaperonin-mediated inhibition of mhtt aggregation observed in reconstituted systems, which is what we set out to characterize structurally. We have clarified this point in the revised text."
