We report that hemocytes in the caterpillar, <i>Pieris rapae</i> are able to synthesize 5-HT following activation by lipopolysaccharide. The inhibition of a serotonin-generating enzyme with either pharmacological blockade or RNAi knock-down impaired hemocyte phagocytosis. Biochemical and functional experiments showed that naive hemocytes primarily express 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. The blockade of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> significantly reduced phagocytic ability, however the blockade of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> increased hemocyte phagocytosis. The 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>-null <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> mutants showed higher mortality than controls when infected with bacteria, due to their decreased phagocytotic ability. Flies expressing 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> or 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> RNAi in hemocytes also showed similar sensitivity to infection. Combined, these data demonstrate that 5-HT mediates hemocyte phagocytosis through 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors and serotonergic signaling performs critical modulatory functions in immune systems of animals separated by 500 million years of evolution."
