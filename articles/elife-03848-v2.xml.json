The existence of a multipotent progenitor for all anatomic and cellular components of the heart has been predicted but its identity and contribution to the two cardiac progenitor \u2018fields\u2019 has remained undefined. Here we show, using clonal genetic fate mapping, that <i>Mesp1+</i> cells in gastrulating mesoderm are rapidly specified into committed cardiac precursors fated for distinct anatomic regions of the heart. We identify <i>Smarcd3</i> as a marker of early specified cardiac precursors and identify within these precursors a compartment boundary at the future junction of the left and right ventricles that arises prior to morphogenesis. Our studies define the timing and hierarchy of cardiac progenitor specification and demonstrate that the cellular and anatomical fate of mesoderm-derived cardiac cells is specified very early. These findings will be important to understand the basis of congenital heart defects and to derive cardiac regeneration strategies."

The existence of a multipotent progenitor for all anatomic and cellular components of the heart has been predicted but its identity and contribution to the two cardiac progenitor \u2018fields\u2019 has remained undefined. Here we show, using clonal genetic fate mapping, that <i>Mesp1+</i> cells in gastrulating mesoderm are rapidly specified into committed cardiac precursors fated for distinct anatomic regions of the heart. We identify <i>Smarcd3</i> as a marker of early specified cardiac precursors and identify within these precursors a compartment boundary at the future junction of the left and right ventricles that arises prior to morphogenesis. Our studies define the timing and hierarchy of cardiac progenitor specification and demonstrate that the cellular and anatomical fate of mesoderm-derived cardiac cells is specified very early. These findings will be important to understand the basis of congenital heart defects and to derive cardiac regeneration strategies."

This means that if there is a single pool of heart precursor cells, it specializes into different populations very early in the development of an embryo."

These two populations are separated by a boundary, which Devine et al. suggest is established very early on, and will go on to form the septum that separates the left and right ventricles in the developed heart. As defects in the septum are the source of many congenital heart defects, a better understanding of the heart cell precursor populations and how they interact could help develop treatments for these conditions."

Understanding the identity and regulation of these progenitors is critical to understanding the origins of congenital heart defects and may lead to novel cell-based regenerative therapies for heart disease (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bruneau, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Xin et al., 2013</a>). The existence of an early and specific multipotent progenitor for all anatomic and cellular components of the heart has been predicted (<a href=\"#bib36\">Parameswaran and Tam 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tam et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Meilhac et al., 2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kinder et al., 2001</a>), but the identity of this progenitor and when it arises in embryonic development has remained undefined. At least two sets of molecularly and morphologically distinct cardiac precursors have been identified in the mammalian embryo, referred to as the first and second heart fields; these populations contribute to distinct anatomical structures within the heart (<a href=\"#bib16\">Evans et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buckingham et al., 2005</a>). Separation of the left and right ventricles is dependent on a single structure, the interventricular septum (IVS) and it has been postulated that the IVS myocardium has a dual contribution from these two heart fields (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bruneau et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Takeuchi et al., 2003</a>). The existence of these two cardiac progenitor \u2018fields\u2019 raises the question of when cardiac precursors are allocated to these populations and their contributions to mature structures in the heart, such as the IVS."

However it is clear that <i>Mesp1</i>+ cells can also contribute to a broad range of mesodermal derivatives that include, but are not restricted to, the developing heart (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yoshida et al., 2008</a>). A population of mesoderm labeled by <i>Eomesodermin</i> has also been shown to contribute to the developing heart, but again these cells have broad contributions in the embryo (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</a>). Retrospective lineage analysis supports the distinct origins of segments of the heart from individual precursor pools (<a href=\"#bib32\">Meilhac et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buckingham et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Meilhac et al., 2004b</a>), but several questions remain regarding the timing and molecular progression of cardiac specification (<a href=\"#bib31\">Meilhac et al., 2004b</a>). For example, do early mesodermal cells become \u2018locked into\u2019 a cardiac fate early on and when do they become \u2018assigned\u2019 to an anatomical location? Is there a multipotent, specified cardiac progenitor that anticipates the currently understood heart fields?"

Clonal labeling of early cardiac precursors highlights the heterogeneity among Mesp1+ progenitors, including the existence of precursors that are restricted in their anatomical contribution, especially to distinct ventricular chambers. Finally, inducible genetic marking of early <i>Tbx5</i>+ and <i>Mef2c</i>-<i>AHF</i> + populations highlights this early segregation of cardiac progenitors and suggests that the compartment boundary that exists between the right and left ventricles arises from an early clonal boundary, prior to the onset of septum morphogenesis.

We reasoned that among this diverse mesodermal population, a more specific population destined for the cardiac lineage exists. To test this model, we performed in vivo clonal analysis by generating mosaic mice in which very few <i>Mesp1</i>+ cells were labeled at isolated clonal density via the mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) system (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hippenmeyer et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). This approach is particularly advantageous because labeling events are rare, labeling is permanent, and one can identify labeled daughter cells (twin spots) based on color (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We analyzed in fetuses (E12.5-E14.5) the anatomic distribution and cellular constituents of clones induced by <i>Mesp1</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> (which is active in mesoderm from \u223cE6.0 to E7.5) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Saga et al., 1999</a>). While we did not use a conditional Cre allele to control the timing of Cre activity, we confirmed the timing of <i>Cre</i> expression by in situ hybridization (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). By the late head fold stage (LHF), we see a downregulation of <i>Cre</i> mRNA and localization to the base of the allantois. We see no expression in the area of forming cardiogenic mesoderm. In addition, we counted the number of labeling events in embryos at E8.5 and E14.5 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E</a> and Statistical Analysis) and saw no change in the distribution of labeled clusters, suggesting that no additional recombination events have occurred over this time interval. Finally, a complementary lineage labeling approach using a <i>Mesp1-rtTA</i> transgenic allele (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lescroart et al., 2014</a>) defines a functional window of Mesp1 activity based on the timing of doxycycline administration between E6.25-E7.5, again supporting the narrow timing of <i>Mesp1</i> activity."

In contrast to previous retrospective clonal analysis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Meilhac et al., 2004b</a>), we did not observe twin spots that populated anatomic structures classically thought to derive from first and second heart field progenitors, for example spanning the left and right ventricles, or contributing to the left ventricle and outflow tract. Rather, we saw twin spots that populated discreet anatomic locations including the left ventricle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>), right ventricle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013D</a>), outflow tract (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1N\u2013O</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E\u2013F</a>), atria-left ventricle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L\u2013M</a>), and interventricular septum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Notably absent from our clonal analysis were twin spots that spanned the right and left ventricles. Based on the total number of clonal observations made (n = 96), the probability that a common progenitor for the left and right ventricles does not exist, assuming a binomial distribution (success, or 1, = the progenitor is observed; failure, or 0 = the progenitor is not observed), can be calculated using Jeffreys interval. The upper and lower limits of a 95% confidence interval was calculated such that the upper limit is 0.019 (See Statistical Methods). Thus, we can be quite confident given the number of observations made that such a common progenitor does not exist within the <i>Mesp1</i>+ population. An explanation for the discrepancy between our <i>Mesp1</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup>-MADM clonal analysis and prior retrospective clonal analyses lies with the timing of the labeling events. <i>Mesp1</i> is transiently expressed ((<a href=\"#bib38\">Saga et al., 1999</a>) and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), thus all of our clones are induced over a narrow window of time during gastrulation. The retrospective clonal analysis employed a cardiomyocyte-specific promoter, so an early labeling event (in the epiblast for example) that would contribute broadly throughout the embryo would only be visualized in the heart, giving the impression of a specific common progenitor cell. Indeed, when we perform MADM clonal analysis using the epiblast-specific Cre line <i>Sox2::Cre</i>, we see many clones in the embryos, including large, dispersed clones throughout the looping heart tube (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) that could be interpreted as a labeling event in a single, common cardiac progenitor. We cannot definitively conclude, however, that these labeled cells within the heart are all clonally related because of the large number of labeling events outside of the heart. In summary, our results suggest that soon after a heart field progenitor is specified, shortly after the initiation of gastrulation, the anatomic destiny of daughter cells quickly diverge, especially those destined to occupy /contribute to the left or right ventricle, and these fates remain fixed."

To define the order and timing of early cardiac gene expression in vivo, we examined by in situ hybridization and by <i>\u00df-galactosidase</i> reporter activity early markers of cardiac differentiation (<i>Mef2c, Tbx5, Isl1, Mesp1, and Smarcd3</i>) at the late streak (LS) and early head fold (EHF) stages. We find that <i>Smarcd3</i> expression precedes <i>Isl1</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> in a domain that lies at the anterior-proximal region of the embryo and extends into the extraembryonic tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D\u2013E</a>). This expression domain appears coincident temporally but non-overlapping with <i>Mesp1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but is within the <i>Mesp1</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup><i>-</i>derived lineage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4O\u2013P</a>). Activity of the <i>Mef2cAHF</i> enhancer (<a href=\"#bib50\">Verzi et al., 2005</a>) is also detected at the LS stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) prior to the expression of <i>Tbx5</i> and <i>Isl1</i>. Previous studies have shown that activity of this enhancer is dependent on <i>Isl1</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dodou et al., 2004</a>). In order to confirm an absence of <i>Isl1</i> expression at the LS stage, we used a reporter allele where a nuclear lacZ (<i>Isl1</i><sup><i>nLacZ</i></sup>) has replaced a short segment of the coding sequence, including the endogenous start codon (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2007</a>). While there was robust <i>\u00df-galactosidase</i> reporter activity at the cardiac crescent stage, no detectable staining was seen in LS stage embryos (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>), suggesting that initiation of <i>Mef2cAHF</i> enhancer expression precedes <i>Isl1</i> expression and its initiation may be independent of <i>Isl1</i>. Several hours later (EHF stage), weak <i>Isl1</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> expression is detectable, <i>Mef2cAHF</i> activity remains, and <i>Smarcd3</i> expression restricts to the embryo proper (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013J</a>). The VEGF-A receptor Flk1 labels multipotent progenitors that can differentiate into hematopoietic, endothelial, smooth muscle and cardiac lineages (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ishitobi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kattman et al., 2006</a>), thus we looked at co-localization of <i>Mesp1</i>, Flk1, and <i>Smarcd3</i> in late streak embryos. While we find minimal overlap between <i>Mesp1</i> and Flk1 and <i>Mesp1</i> and a reporter of early <i>Smarcd3</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,C\u2013D</a>), there is significant overlap of Flk1 with this same reporter of early <i>Smarcd3 expression</i> (see below) in late streak stage embryos. Taken together, we see an orderly progression of gene expression that follows the progressive commitment of nascent mesoderm, from early expression of <i>Mesp1</i> to the intermediate expression of <i>Smarcd3</i>, Flk1, and the <i>Mef2cAHF enhancer,</i> and finally the later cardiac lineage-specific expression of <i>Tbx5</i> and <i>Isl1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>)."

To define the lineage potential of <i>Smarcd3</i>+ cells and to compare the lineage potential of the cell populations marked by our two enhancer elements, we performed temporally regulated genetic fate-mapping using mice expressing a tamoxifen inducible CreERT2 under control of the <i>Smarcd3-</i>F1 and <i>Smarcd3-</i>F6 sequences (<i>Smarcd3-</i>F1CreERT2 and <i>Smarcd3-</i>F6CreERT2 mice; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013H</a>). Lineage labeling of <i>Smarcd3-</i>F1CreERT2; <i>Rosa</i><sup><i>R26R</i></sup> at E5.5 and observation at E10.5 marked cells that contribute predominantly to the heart and anterior forelimb (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>), with scattered cells in the trunk and cranial mesoderm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and data not shown); observation at earlier time points revealed significant labeling in extraembryonic tissues (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). Within the heart, labeled cells contribute to cardiomyocyte, endocardial, and pericardial layers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Labeling one day earlier (E4.5) marks a similar distribution of cells but with reduced labeling (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F</a>). Earlier induction (E3.5) and non-injected animals have minimal to no detectable labeling (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2G\u2013K</a> and data not shown). Given the restricted expression pattern of the <i>Smarcd-</i>F6 enhancer, we hypothesized that marking these cells early on would label a more restricted population of cells later in the embryo. Indeed, lineage tracing with <i>Smarcd3-</i>F6CreERT2 labeled a much smaller number of more spatially defined cells, including the heart and a small group of cells in the anterior forelimb (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>). There was minimal to no labeling in head/trunk mesoderm or in extraembryonic tissues, and within the heart <i>Smarcd3-</i>F6CreERT2 labeled primarily the myocardial layer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>), consistent with this enhancer labeling a more restricted population of cells. We addressed the clonal potential of early <i>Smarcd3</i>+ cells with limiting doses of tamoxifen to induce small numbers of well-isolated labeled cells in <i>Smarcd3</i>-F1CreERT2;<i>Rosa</i><sup><i>R26R</i></sup> embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>). The shape and distribution of the labeled patches is reminiscent of previous work describing the oriented clonal cell growth throughout the myocardium (<a href=\"#bib30\">Meilhac et al., 2004a</a>). In order to confirm the clonal nature of these patches induced with our <i>Smarcd3</i>-F1CreERT2 allele, we attempted to perform MADM analysis with this particular allele. Unfortunately, the recombination frequency was too low to identify any clones in several litters of embryos and we proceeded with using the <i>Rosa</i><sup><i>Confetti</i></sup> multicolor reporter (<a href=\"#bib39\">Snippert et al., 2010</a>). We identified 6 <i>Smarcd3</i>-F1CreERT2;<i>Rosa</i><sup><i>Confetti</i></sup> embryos from several litters where tamoxifen was administered at E5.5, which contained rare or infrequent labeling events; none of these examples showed a labeling pattern that would support a common progenitor contributing to both right and left ventricles. Instead, we saw isolated, single-color clones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>) that contributed to a single chamber. While the number of embryos we examined is not sufficient to reach statistical significance, the results are highly supportive of our conclusions from the Mesp1Cre-MADM analysis. We conclude that <i>Smarcd3</i> expression in the late gastrulating embryo labels a defined population of specified cardiac precursors that are fated to occupy unique anatomic structures within the mature heart."

We generated a mouse ES cell line with a targeted insertion of the <i>Smarcd3-</i>F6 enhancer driving expression of a fluorescent reporter and we differentiated these cells into cardiomyocytes using an established directed differentiation protocol (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wamstad et al., 2012</a>). In this system, we find expression of <i>Mesp1</i> is rapidly induced at early mesoderm stage (Day 3-Day 4) while expression of the cardiac precursor markers <i>Nkx2-5</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> initiate about a day later (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Expression of <i>Smarcd3</i> as well as the <i>Smarcd3-</i>F6 reporter are detectable in ES cells and gradually decline until both are sharply induced at Day 4. At the same time, <i>Mesp1</i> expression is rapidly downregulated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). As a result, <i>Mesp1</i> and <i>Smarcd3</i> mRNA are largely non-overlapping, temporally. We isolated total RNA from three biological replicates of sorted cells shortly after the initiation of reporter activity at the mesoderm stage (D4.75) and compared the gene expression profiles of GFP + to GFP- cells by RNA-seq (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). GFP + cells expressed genes associated with early cardiovascular progenitors (e.g. <i>Hand2, Gata4, and Meis1</i>), while GFP- cells expressed genes associated with hematopoietic and other lineages. Among the GFP + population, we attempted to identify markers that were unique to either cardiomyocyte or endocardial progenitors. While cell type-specific markers for differentiated cells are well documented (eg. contractile proteins for cardiomyocytes vs <i>Nfatc1</i> for endocardial cells) such markers are less well defined at the early stages when we are isolating mRNA. In addition, our differentiation protocol pushes cells towards a cardiomyocyte fate, thus we may not expect to see any endocardial cell markers. One gene of interest that appears to be depleted in our GFP + population/enriched in our GFP- population is <i>Tal1/Scl</i>. This gene had been implicated as a critical component of endocardial morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bussmann et al., 2007</a>) and more recently has been shown to repress cardiomyogenesis in yolk sac vasculature and endocardium (<a href=\"#bib49\">Van Handel et al., 2012</a>). A complete list of differentially expressed genes meeting a strict false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.02 (2%) is presented in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 6\u2014Source data 1</a>. Overall, these results indicate that cells labeled by the <i>Smarcd3</i>-F6 enhancer, both in vivo and in vitro, represent an early cardiac progenitor population."

                        "text": "One class of clones identified in our <i>Mesp1</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup>-MADM clonal analysis included twin spots within the interventricular septum (IVS) between the left and right ventricles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). These twin spots formed a sharp boundary within the IVS, reminiscent of compartment boundaries classically defined in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc and mammalian midbrain-hindbrain boundary (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lawrence and Struhl, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dahmann and Basler, 1999</a>). To determine if and when this boundary between the right ventricle and left ventricle is established, we performed temporally regulated genetic fate-mapping to mark early cardiac progenitors and followed their contribution later in the mature IVS. In order to mark cells that would contribute to the right ventricle, we used the <i>Mef2c-AHF</i> enhancer (<a href=\"#bib50\">Verzi et al., 2005</a>) to drive expression of a fusion of the Dre recombinase (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anastassiadis et al., 2009</a>) to the tamoxifen inducible ERT2 protein (<i>Mef2cAHF</i><sup><i>DreERT2</i></sup>). We found that this enhancer element is expressed very early in the embryo, in a domain that appeared to partially overlap with that of <i>Smarcd3</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,H</a>). Previous work using a constitutive Cre recombinase expressed under the control of the <i>Mef2cAHF</i> enhancer suggested that endothelial and myocardial components of the outflow tract, right ventricle, and IVS are derived from this population (<a href=\"#bib50\">Verzi et al., 2005</a>). To label the complementary population of progenitors that contribute predominantly to the left ventricle, we targeted a tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase to the <i>Tbx5</i> locus (<i>Tbx5</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). In the looped heart, expression of <i>Tbx5</i> is restricted to the left ventricle and atria with very little expression in the right ventricle or outflow tract (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bruneau et al., 1999</a>). Early labeling of <i>Tbx5+</i> cells marked cells that were predominantly restricted to the left ventricle and atria (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013F and 7I\u2013L</a>); scattered surface labeling on the right ventricle (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1I\u2013J</a>) was also seen with early tamoxifen injection, but myocardial labeling was limited to the LV up to the junction with the RV at the IVS. Earlier observation at E8.5 following a pulse of tamoxifen at E6.5 revealed labeling in a restricted population of cells within the presumptive left ventricle (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that the Tbx5 lineage restriction arises early and is not a consequence of later sorting out of cells. Labeling <i>Mef2cAHF</i> + cells at E6.5 marked a complementary population of cells that were largely restricted to the right ventricle and outflow tract (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Using an intersectional reporter that responds to the combined activity of Cre and Dre we confirmed that these early <i>Mef2cAHF</i> + cells are also within the <i>Smarcd3-</i>F1 lineage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7M</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013C</a>). The expression of <i>Tbx5</i> and the <i>Mef2AHF</i> enhancer appears to label complementary populations that are established prior to morphogenesis, which correspond, in part, to left and right ventricular precursors, respectively."

Our results, and those of <a href=\"#bib28\">Lescroart et al.

Whether these mesodermal cells retain plasticity and could adopt different fates if transplanted elsewhere in the embryo is not clear. We also cannot at this point distinguish between a scenario where <i>Mesp1</i>+ cells are pre-patterned or the gradual restriction of <i>Mesp1</i>+ cells to different lineage fates during gastrulation in response to signaling cues. Understanding which molecular cues induce the emergence and patterning of this population of early cardiac precursors will be of considerable interest, particularly in the context of regenerative cell therapy, and especially given the apparent heterogeneity of early cardiac progenitors."

These results are consistent with genetic tracing of cardiac precursors expressing <i>Hcn4</i>, which contribute to the left ventricle and conduction system (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sp\u00e4ter et al., 2013</a>), and we additionally show, at both a population and single cell level, that both left and right ventricular progenitors are independently established early in development and are separated by a compartment boundary. This compartment boundary is derived from a unique population of early progenitors that express <i>Tbx5</i> as well as a subpopulation of cells co-expressing the <i>Mef2cAHF</i> enhancer, suggesting that a relatively small number of cells may be important in establishing and/or maintaining this border between the left and right ventricles. Understanding the molecular and cellular basis of this compartment boundary, and its importance in ventricular septation, will be of great relevance to congenital heart defects.

Indeed, fate mapping in the chick embryo suggests distinct origins of the outflow tract vs the remainder of the heart, but does not indicate a compartmentalization of left and right ventricular progenitors, nor what molecular identity early cardiac precursors adopt (<a href=\"#bib11\">Camp et al., 2012</a>). Our data suggest that the mouse embryo, despite the complexity of its developing heart, has a very early patterning and allocation of mesodermal cells to specific cardiac fates and anatomical derivatives. In addition, it has been hypothesized that simpler organisms have integrated cardiac and pharyngeal mesoderm into a single lineage, the so-called cardiopharyngeal mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stolfi et al., 2010</a>). Retrospective clonal analysis in the mouse (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lescroart et al., 2010</a>) suggests a conservation of shared cardiac and pharyngeal lineages; caveats applicable to chamber-specific lineage allocation, including the timing of clone induction and the promoter used to visualize clones, remain. Lescroart and colleagues more recently reported rare instances of <i>Mesp1</i>+ clones co-labeling head muscles and the heart (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lescroart et al., 2014</a>). In our lineage labeling experiments, using the MADM system, we do not see convincing evidence for a common heart and head muscle progenitor. Additionally, <i>Smarcd3</i>+ precursors contribute to heart but not facial muscle.

The pWHERE plasmid (InvivoGen) was digested using a blunt cutter (SmaI) and an RFA \u2018C\u2019 Gateway cassette (Invitrogen) was inserted 5\u2032 to the promoterless nls-LacZ reporter gene to make a destination vector (pWHERE-DV). For construction of pWHERE-DV-CreERT2, a Gateway RFA \u2018B\u2019 cassette was amplified by PCR and cloned into the AvrII site of pWHERE using Cold Fusion cloning (System Biosciences Inc.). The resulting plasmid was digested with XhoI and NheI to remove the nls-LacZ reporter and a cassette encoding CreERT2 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Feil et al., 1997</a>) was amplified and inserted using Cold Fusion Cloning. Construction of the <i>Mef2cAHF</i><sup><i>DreERT2</i></sup> allele will be described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the CAGEN-DV plasmid (Devine and Bruneau, unpublished) was digested with SpeI and XbaI to remove the CAGGS (Chicken Beta-Actin promoter with CMV enhancer) promoter and the resulting ends blunted. The Mef2c-F6/frag3 plasmid (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dodou et al., 2004</a>) was digested with XhoI and SalI to isolate the 3970 bp cardiac enhancer fragment. The resulting ends were blunted and the two blunt-ended fragments ligated together to make the destination vector (Mef2c-F6-DV). A Gateway compatible entry clone for DreERT2 was constructed by PCR stitching of Dre (minus the nls) from plasmid DNA containing a codon-improved version of Dre (a generous gift of Francis Stewart, Biotechnology Center TU, Dresden, Germany) and ERT2 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Feil et al., 1997</a>) separated by a short linker se quence (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hunter et al., 2005</a>) to generate DreERT2. Upon LR recombination with entry clones and destination reporter plasmids, the final vectors were restriction mapped and verified by DNA sequencing. Multiple founders were examined for each transgene. All experiments using mice were reviewed and approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with all institutional and federal guidelines."

Importantly, this translocation event does not happen in the absence of Cre-recombinase (our observations and previously published (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tasic et al., 2012</a>)) and there is no visible labeling prior to translocation. We have empirically defined the frequency of this event by measuring two different variables: (1) the total number of cells that can undergo this translocation and (2) the observed frequency of labeled clones. The total number of cells that could undergo translocation was determined by counting the number of cells that had recombined a Cre-dependent reporter (<i>Rosa</i><sup><i>td-Tomato</i></sup>) at the end of gastrulation (E7.5). FACS analysis determined that this number was \u223c850 cells (\u223c1/3 of the total number of cells in the embryo at this time (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>))."

Thus a rare subpopulation, such as a common progenitor for both the right and left ventricles, would be missed only if it represented less than 10% of the total Mesp1 population."

For example, clone MM2 could be interpreted as one recombination event that gave rise to two clusters: one in the right ventricle and one in the left ventricle. However the color combinations seen (red/green twin spots in right ventricle and yellow/blank twin spots in left ventricle) exclude the possibility that these two clusters are derived from the same event. Likewise, for clone MM26, only two labeled patches are seen in the entire embryo (red twin spot in left ventricle and green twin spot in right atrium). Assuming there is no selective loss of twin spots (as we have determined above by measuring the clonal frequency at two different time points) we can conclude that these two clusters are derived from a single event."

Utilizing the mesodermal germ layer marking Mesp1 in conjunction with transcriptional elements from Smarcd3, which is expressed within the Mesp1 cell population, the authors make a compelling case that specification of cardiac progenitors occurs early, that this specification is concurrent for each heart field, and that there is not a common progenitor for primary and secondary heart fields. This is an important topic, as these stages are difficult to access technically and there are outstanding questions about the heterogeneity of cardiac progenitors. The number and variety of mouse strains employed for lineage tracing, some of which are generated for this manuscript, and the number of experiments performed, are impressive. The results suggest that the mammalian heart is compartmentalized at early life stages. Overall, this is an interesting and well executed study; however, a few of the conclusions need further support or clarification."

While we have not used a conditional Cre allele to control the timing of Cre activity, we believe there are several lines of evidence that support the conclusion that <i>Mesp1</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> is active (and thus clones are induced) over a very narrow temporal window (from \u223cE6.0-E7.5). First, we have performed <i>in situ</i> hybridization for <i>Cre</i> mRNA in <i>Mesp1</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> embryos at multiple stages and find that by the late head fold stage (LHF) expression of Cre mRNA is largely restricted to the allantoic base and allantoic membrane with minimal expression in area of the forming cardiogenic mesoderm (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>), supporting the idea that <i>Cre</i> mRNA and thus Cre activity is extinguished after E7.5."

Second, in the original reference describing the expression and requirement of <i>Mesp1</i> in early gastrulating mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib38\">Saga et al. 1999</a>) they look both at <i>Mesp1</i> mRNA (their <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G-3L</a>) as well as <i>beta</i>-galactosidase activity in a knock-in allele (their <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-3F</a>). Even with the perdurance of <i>beta</i>-galactosidase enzyme activity, the authors see minimal X-gal staining after E7.75. If we assume that <i>beta</i>-galactosidase activity likely persists as long or longer than Cre protein activity, it is unlikely that clones are induced after \u223cE7.5. Third, we have counted the number of clones in embryos at E8.5 and at E14.5 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1C-D</a> and Statistical Analysis) and we see a similar distribution, suggesting that no additional clones are induced over this time window. Finally, a recent paper (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lescroart et al. 2014</a>) describes a complementary lineage labeling approach using a <i>Mesp1</i>-rtTA transgenic allele. Based on the timing of doxycycline administration, they define a functional window of Mesp1 activity between E6.25-E7.5, consistent with what we and others have shown."

Nonetheless, we crossed our <i>Smarcd3</i>-F1<sup>CreERT2</sup> allele with the <i>ROSA</i><sup><i>Confetti</i></sup> allele and induced recombination early (E6.5) and identified 6 embryos from several litters that contained rare or infrequent labeling events and none of these examples showed a labeling pattern that would support a common progenitor contributing to both right and left ventricles.
