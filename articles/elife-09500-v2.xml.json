Sister kinetochores bind bundles of dynamic microtubules and are physically connected through centromeric chromatin. A crucial question is to understand how sister kinetochores are coordinated to generate motility and directional switches. Here, we combine super-resolution tracking of kinetochores with automated switching-point detection to analyse sister switching dynamics over thousands of events. We discover that switching is initiated by both the leading (microtubules depolymerising) or trailing (microtubules polymerising) kinetochore. Surprisingly, trail-driven switching generates an overstretch of the chromatin that relaxes over the following half-period. This rules out the involvement of a tension sensor, the central premise of the long-standing tension-model. Instead, our data support a model in which clocks set the intrinsic-switching time of the two kinetochore-attached microtubule fibres, with the centromeric spring tension operating as a feedback to slow or accelerate the clocks."

Before a cell divides it copies its entire set of chromosomes to make paired chomosomes known as sister chromatids. Then, the sister chromatids are separated to ensure that each new daughter cell contains a full set of chromosomes. A structure called the spindle is responsible for separating the sister chromatids. It is made of long filaments called microtubules that grow out from 'poles' at opposite sides of a cell. The two sister chromatids in each pair attach to microtubules that originate from opposite ends of the cell. This attachment is achieved by a protein machine called the kinetochore, which can move along microtubules as they grow or shrink."

For the majority of the time, one sister kinetochore moves towards the pole it is attached to (called the lead sister), while the other sister moves away from the pole it is attached to (the trailing sister). Then, the kinetochores swap roles and move in the opposite direction. In most cells, the pairs of sister kinetochores repeatedly switch between moving backwards and forwards giving rise to oscillations in the positions of the sister chromatids."

Using computational techniques to analyse kinetochore movements in living cells, the experiments reveal that the trailing sister kinetochore can sometimes change direction before the lead sister. When this happens the sisters start to move apart until the previously leading sister switches direction, so that the sisters then movingve together in the same direction. The distance between the sisters remains high until the next time the sisters change direction, which means that 'tension' cannot solely be responsible for the communication between sister kinetochores."

Bi-orientation begins immediately after nuclear envelope breakdown during prometaphase\u00a0when scattered chromosomes engage the nascent mitotic spindle, and concludes with the formation of the metaphase plate \u2013 a state where all sister kinetochores are bi-orientated and aligned on the equator of a bipolar spindle\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">McIntosh et al., 2012</a>). To achieve this bi-orientation, sister kinetochores must be able to undergo directed movements to the equator (this is termed congression) and then maintain their position prior to anaphase onset \u2013 a feature of this latter phase is oscillations of the chromosomes along the spindle axis. Directed motility is possible because one sister\u00a0adopts a poleward (P) moving state (the lead sister) while the other is\u00a0in an away-from-the-pole (AP) moving state (the trailing sister). These two movement states reflect the balance of microtubule polymerisation/depolymerisation within the kinetochore-fibre (K-fibre), which is typically 20\u201325 microtubules in human cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Compton, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Rieder, 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">Wendell et al., 1993</a>). While such\u00a0K-fibres are rarely coherent, there is a small polymerisation bias between sister kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armond et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">VandenBeldt et al., 2006</a>) and they can be thought of as being in either a net polymerising or depolymerising state. The adaptive switching between these AP and P states then defines the directionality\u00a0of chromosome motion and can give rise to the quasi-periodic oscillations that are observed in the majority of vertebrate cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Skibbens et al., 1993</a>). An outstanding question is to understand the mechanisms by which the two sister kinetochores are able to communicate in order to coordinate their P/AP states and thereby generate chromosome movements."

Kinetochores were shown to undergo periods of relatively constant velocity separated by abrupt changes in direction \u2013 a behaviour termed \u2018directional instability\u2019. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that weakening the centromeric chromatin which links the sisters (with a laser) uncoupled the normally coordinated motility of sister kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib11\">Skibbens et al., 1995</a>).\u00a0These experiments led to a model (also see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib9\">Rieder and Salmon, 1994</a>) in which tension in the centromeric chromatin\u00a0triggers a lead sister switch (P-to-AP) at a certain threshold, the loss of tension then triggering a directional switch in the second sister (AP-to-P). More recent kinetochore-tracking experiments in PtK1 cells are consistent with this model and show that switching initiates at maximum inter-kinetochore stretch\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Wan et al., 2012)</a>, schematic shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>.\u00a0The polar ejection force, which increases with proximity to the pole,\u00a0pushes the chromosomes towards the metaphase plate.\u00a0When chromosomes stray far from the equator, this anti-poleward force increases the load on the leading (P) kinetochore and promotes switching \u2013 an idea supported by experiments in newt and human cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Ke et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Stumpff et al., 2012</a>).\u00a0The standard\u00a0tension\u00a0model thus predicts a fixed sequence of sister kinetochore-switching\u00a0events during a directional reversal \u2013 lead switch first, followed by trail. However, the timeframe for these events is short (several seconds), requiring\u00a0a sampling rate that avoids temporal aliasing. Existing kinetochore-tracking assays have a frame\u00a0rate in the 7.5\u201315\u2009s range (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dumont et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Jaqaman et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib18\">Wan et al., 2012),</a> meaning that detailed analysis of the switching mechanism has not been possible to date."

As the leading, poleward-moving, kinetochore (P; black) moves to the right, the centromeric chromatin (blue) \u2013\u00a0which functions as a compliant linkage between sisters \u2013 becomes progressively more stretched (steps i,\u00a0ii). Stretching occurs because the trailing, away-from-the-pole, kinetochore (AP; red) is moving more slowly than the lead. Once sisters are at maximum stretch, the tension in the chromatin is thought to trigger the lead sister kinetochore to switch into an AP state. This results in a rapid loss of tension as both sisters are then in an AP state and moving towards each other (step iii). This relaxation is thought to trigger switching of the initially trailing sister into a P-moving state (step iv). Adapted from <a href=\"#bib18\">Wan et al., 2012</a>."

To improve resolution, we used spinning disk confocal microscopy to capture 3D image stacks every 2\u2009s over 150 time steps in HeLa-K cells expressing a marker for the kinetochores (either eGFP-CENP-A or eGFP-CENP-A eGFP-Centrin1; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Phototoxicity was minimal, as &gt;90% of cells successfully underwent anaphase. Sister kinetochores were tracked as previously described (<a href=\"#bib5\">Jaqaman et al., 2010)</a>, except that\u00a0we implemented 3D Gaussian mixture model fitting for determining sub-pixel spot locations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Thomann et al., 2002</a> see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, C</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media5\">5</a>)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0important here because our faster time sampling results in a smaller inter-frame spot displacement requiring higher localisation accuracy. This sub-pixel (super-resolution) tracking gives high theoretical positional accuracy (<i>x,y</i> = \u00b1 2.8\u00a0nm; <i>z</i> = \u00b1 5.7\u00a0nm; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and\u00a0reveals kinetochore dynamics in exquisite detail (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib5\">Jaqaman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Vladimirou et al., 2013</a>), sister kinetochores had a mean inter-kinetochore distance of ~910\u00a0nm and underwent quasi-periodic oscillations normal to the metaphase plate with a half-period of 35\u2009s (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement\u00a01A,B</a>). Finally, we constructed a Bayesian switching point inference algorithm that estimates from an observed sister pair trajectory the switching times\u00a0for each sister (most probable frame) and the directional switching events by assignment of a direction of movement to each sister\u00a0(see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Here, we focus on <i>coherent runs</i> (periods when the sisters are\u00a0moving in the same direction) and the switching events that end runs. We tested this algorithm on simulated data where the true switch time is known giving accuracies of 94% (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This switching point algorithm determined whether the leading or trailing sister\u00a0switches first in a directional reversal of the sister pair and by how many frames."

The LIDS event leaves the two K-fibres in a polymerising state, which decreases the inter-sister distance; this is in line with the standard model where the inter-sister distance will then undergo extension over the following coherent run\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).\u00a0The relaxation of the spring immediately prior to the first sister switch appears to be the result of the lead sister slowing down (data not shown). This would be in\u00a0line with experiments in Ptk1 cells in which the velocity slows at maximal inter-sister stretch\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). Finally, the switching of the second (trailing) sister correlates with the reduction in spring extension to near zero\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure\u00a04A</a>), possibly suggesting that switching is the result of a loss of tension in accord with the standard tension\u00a0model (<a href=\"#bib9\">Rieder et al., 1994</a>)."

The maximum stretch (25%) is only reached 4\u2009s after the switch has occurred. This indicates that the TIDS itself is necessary to build up tension in the centromeric chromatin while the maximum inter-sister stretch is higher than that seen during LIDS (average 200\u00a0nm spring extension).\u00a0The LIDS and TIDS signatures are also present if we condition on the previous event type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), showing that although the previous event type does affect the inter-sister distance prior to the next event, the qualitative form is similar close to the switching event. The high overstretch of the centromeric chromatin\u00a0during a TIDS raises a fundamental challenge to the standard tension model of kinetochore oscillations which states that the spring tension rises during a run of the sister pair\u00a0(to the left or right) triggering a leading sister\u00a0switch and relaxes during a directional switching event which triggers switching of the second sister (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). As illustrated above, this describes\u00a0a repeated LIDS choreography. However, following a\u00a0TIDS event, the\u00a0centromeric\u00a0spring tension escalates during the directional switch and starts to relax\u00a04\u2009s after the directional switch (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure\u00a04A</a>), suggesting that the tension remains high over the following run."

For runs with a preceding switch that was either a LIDS or a TIDS, the inter-sister distance\u00a0rose (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) or relaxed\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) over the following run, respectively.\u00a0At the end of the run, the spring profile had the LIDS or\u00a0TIDS signature depending on the next event type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure\u00a04C,D</a>).\u00a0Crucially, for runs starting after a TIDS the subsequent directional switch still has a LIDS bias (1.53\u00a0compared to a bias of 1.64\u00a0for a preceding\u00a0LIDS), while the (median) time of the coherent run is identical to that following a LIDS\u00a0(27.1 \u00b1 0.21\u2009s for TIDS, 26.7 \u00b1 0.29\u2009s for LIDS, p=5.5%).

In essence, kinetochore oscillations are robust to sister switching order and the dynamics of the kinetochores\u00a0is nearly identical after a TIDS and LIDS, except that the inter-sister distance decreases instead of increases, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure\u00a04C,D</a>). Our observations suggest that the classic choreography (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) represents half of the dynamic with the inter-sister distance relaxing under a LIDS then increasing over the subsequent coherent run \u2013 depolymerising K-fibres pulling kinetochores with greater force than polymerising fibres push. However, under a TIDS the inter-sister distance is overstretched and relaxes during the subsequent coherent run \u2013 the\u00a0centromeric spring force increasing the velocity of the trailing sister so that it exceeds that of the lead sister. This TIDS choreography implies that directional switching cannot be triggered by a threshold on the spring tension as overstretching and subsequent relaxation of the spring tension prior to a directional switch are a natural part of metaphase kinetochore oscillations."

The average twist increase seen at a LIDS relaxes over the following coherent run (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), similar to the relaxation in the spring extension seen after a TIDS.\u00a0This can be explained mechanistically since a high inter-sister stretch, indicative of a high inter-sister tension, aligns the sisters, reducing the twist, while a low stretch, with low tension, allows the twist angle to increase under thermal and mechanical fluctuations.\u00a0Thus, a negative correlation between twist and inter-sister distance is predicted if there is mechanical compliance in the attachment of the kinetochore to the K-fibres and the centromeric spring."

This could be a mechanical timing mechanism associated with the attached K-fibre, and thus force sensitive. In this way,\u00a0the trailing sister is kept in a polymerising state by the pulling force from the stretched centromeric chromatin (see model in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This may reflect the ability of the kinetochore to inhibit catastrophe when under tension \u2013 as shown by biophysical experiments using purified budding yeast kinetochores\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</a>). If that tension falls too low (or fails to build up), a TIDS occurs (as microtubules in the K-fibre undergo catastrophe; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The same stabilisation mechanism can be invoked to explain switching resolution \u2013 during a LIDS the second sister (previously trailing), switches under the loss of the tension in the centromeric chromatin.\u00a0When tension remains high enough to stabilise the trailing\u00a0sister, then the lead sister switches because of its clock. The escalating force during a TIDS (after the trailing sister switches)\u00a0could accelerate the lead sister clock triggering switching of the second sister. Again, this reflects the increase in the rescue rate of in vitro microtubules attached to kinetochores as shown in <a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</a>, while it emphasises that the two sisters are not symmetrical and the time since their last switch event determines which sister switches."

Our data are consistent with the presence of a clock on both the leading (black) and trailing (red) sister kinetochores that sets the time at which a directional switch will occur. We propose that the molecular mechanism for the clock is the rescue/catastrophe frequency of the microtubules (green) within the K-fibre. We note that the kinetics of microtubule dynamic instability in vitro cannot alone explain the timing of events (oscillation period); hence, regulation of the dynamics from the kinetochore/K-fibre structure is key. The clock on the trailing sister kinetochore is force-sensitive, such that tension from stretching the centromeric chromatin results in a slow\u00a0down, thereby reducing the probability that the K-fibre will drive a trail initiated directional switch (TIDS). (<b>B</b>) This mechanism can explain the observed relationship between tension dynamics (in centromeric chromatin) and sequences of lead and/or trail initiated directional switches. Following a LIDS (upper half), the spring extension is low and then stretches over the following run. If tension increases quickly enough, then the trailing K-fibre is stabilised (the clock slows down) and the lead kinetochore switches as the clock runs down. If tension does not build up sufficiently, then the trailing K-fibre will not be stabilised and it\u00a0will therefore switch because of its clock. Following a TIDS,\u00a0(lower half), the spring extension is high. The run thus starts with high tension which stabilises the trailing K-fibre. Spring tension relaxes over the run, and if it drops sufficiently, trailing K-fibre stabilisation is lost and the trailing sister switches (TIDS). If tension remains sufficiently high, then the clock on the leading kinetochore initiates the switching event (LIDS). Thus, lead sister initiated switches can occur with falling tension ruling out the standard model (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). (<b>C</b>) This model can also account for why the second sister switches: following a LIDS, both sisters are in an AP state, reducing the spring tension to a near-zero tension state.\u00a0This rapidly destabilises the previously trailing sister leading to a switch (AP to P). We suspect that the new lead sister does not switch in this situation because its clock has been re-set (i.e. the K-fibre is new). When a TIDS occurs, we propose that the very high tension generated during the directional switch accelerates the clock on the sister attached to the older K-fibre (previously the lead sister) causing the second sister to switch."

                        "text": "Although we have detected clear signatures in the switching choreographies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), these reflect regulatory and mechanical processes of a highly stochastic system. This stochasticity is evident on many scales. First, kinetochores are known to display a range of stochasticity in their trajectories, from near deterministic oscillations to the near random (<a href=\"#bib5\">Jaqaman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Magidson et al., 2011</a>). Second, the switching times are stochastic; the duration of a coherent run has a large variability with a coefficient of variation (standard deviation [SD]/mean) of 0.45, similar for both runs terminated by an LIDS (mean time and SD 29.6 \u00b1 12.7\u2009s) or a TIDS (29.2 \u00b1 13.6\u2009s, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, although we have invoked a clock mechanism as a switching time regulator, it is inherently stochastic. This stochasticity could stem from both the number and depolymerisation/polymerisation state of individual microtubules that make up the K-fibre. The fraction of microtubules that are in a polymerising state within a K-fibre is highly variable among kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armond et al., 2015),</a> indicating that growing and shrinking K-fibres are unlikely to be composed of fully coherent microtubules. Third, the signatures in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> are a mean behaviour, while variability in the inter-sister stretch throughout the dynamics is in fact large. This can be seen at the population level of trajectories, where the inter-sister distance distributions for LIDS and TIDS only show marginal separation before the switching event (\u20134\u2009s), are hardly separated at the event, while separation increases after the event (+4\u2009s) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). The inter-sister distance distribution over a switching event is in fact far from bimodal; a mixture of two Gaussian distributions requires the respective means to be separated by at least 2 SDs to be bimodal, the largest we observe is 70% at 4\u2009s post event (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). The separation of these distributions does not improve even on further categorising by the prior event (i.e. prior LIDS or TIDS; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F</a>). Therefore, we have to conclude that the signatures shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> are not a universal behaviour but only detectable on averaging; that is, the actual switching process is highly stochastic. It may be that analysis of the most deterministic trajectories will reduce this stochasticity in the switching dynamics and signatures. However, directional switching may be a composite process that integrates over multiple signals, that is, tension may not be the only determinant; the stochasticity in our signatures would then be due to measuring only one of these determinants. It remains unknown to what extent the stochasticity in switching time and switching type explains the observed diversity in kinetochore trajectory dynamics, or whether other sources of variability exist."

By classifying switching order events, we were able to demonstrate clear stereotypical behaviour associated with these events, with both prior (potentially causal) and post-event signatures in the inter-sister distance dynamics. This confirms that event classification is physical and not due\u00a0to noisy fluctuations in switching times coming from localisation measurement noise."

The first term (c<sub>0</sub>+c(\u03c3<sup>k</sup>)), k=1,2 are the driving terms with a component that switches between two possible values, positive, c<sub>+</sub> corresponding to polymerisation of the K-fibre, or negative, c<sub>-</sub> corresponding to depolymerisation. The direction sequence \u03c3<sup>k</sup>\u00a0(+,- valued for polymerisation, depolymerisation respectively, with k=1,2 identifying the sister) determines which value is used. Driving terms are of opposite sign between sisters 1 and 2 because the K-fibres lie in opposite directions. If (de)polymerisation is turned off, the sisters relax towards the metaphase plate with an inter-sister separation of 2c<sub>0</sub>/(b+a) which must be positive, thereby constraining the sign of these parameters.\u00a0The third/fourth terms are relaxation terms allowing kinetochore positions to adjust to the driving term, that is, the relaxation of the inter-sister distance and distance from the metaphase plate.\u00a0Finally, Gaussian noise is added to model trajectory\u00a0stochasticity; this will comprise measurement noise, thermal noise and non-thermal ATP-dependent fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib19\">Weber et al., 2012</a>). In this model, sisters switch independently (states\u00a0encoded in \u03c3<sup>k</sup>)\u00a0from <i>polymerisation</i> (+) to <i>depolymerisation</i> (-)\u00a0states (states of their associated K-fibres),\u00a0and vice versa; the waiting time is exponentially distributed, that is, there is no memory, location or history dependence assumed. The average waiting time to a switch event is dependent on the direction of the other sister; let p be the matrix of switching rates between the 4 sister states ++, +-, -+, -- parametrised by a switching rate out of coherence, p(+-\u2192 ++ or -\u00a0-)= p(-+\u2192 ++ or -\u00a0-) and out of incoherence, p(++ \u2192 +- or -+)= p(-\u00a0-\u2192 +- or -+), the sister who switches being chosen at random. There is, therefore, no switching bias intrinsic in the algorithm; biases in the experimental data can thus be detected. This model can produce stochastic saw-tooth oscillations under certain parameter regimes (b,c<sub>0</sub>&gt;0 and a&gt;b are necessary) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement\u00a01</a>), qualitatively similar to those observed for sister kinetochores. Crucially if the rate of switching out of incoherence is higher than switching out of coherence (coherence of sister movement [same direction] is thus restored quickly), the model produces pseudo-periodic saw-tooth oscillations qualitatively similar to those observed. This model is thus appropriate for detecting switching times as it has the correct type of behaviour."

The MCMC algorithm is based on standard Gibbs and Metropolis\u2013Hastings proposals, and recovered the true values on simulated data (not shown). We used a prior on the relaxed inter-sister separation of 2c<sub>0</sub>/(b+a) inferred from a nocodazole experiment (fully depolymerised microtubules) while all other priors are uninformative. Convergence was assessed using multiple runs; a proportion of runs failed to converge despite extending the run time (19%). These trajectories were excluded from the analysis and by visual assessment were typically highly stochastic, suggesting the oscillatory signal was weak and thus lack of convergence was not unlikely. This left a database of 1529 processed paired sister tracks in the eGFP-CENP-A cell line. Each trajectory had sufficient information to fit all the parameters using uninformative priors."

Also Guassian noise is added to the position of kinetochores. In the previous submission this was Brownian motion of the kinetochore. In this version, it was unspecified. In living systems, there are considerably greater \"random\" fluctuations than just Brownian. A good citation for this can be found in Weber et al., (2012) Nonthermal ATP-dependent fluctuations contribute to the in vivo motion of chromosomal loci. The non-thermal fluctuations come from the motors, chaperones, ATP machines etc. that are constantly jiggling everything in the cell. Thus the kinetochore is most likely being jostled with a magnitude much greater than Brownian, but with random trajectory. Just examining the trajectory is insufficient to distinguish whether the motion is truly random (Brownian) or these non-thermal energy-dependent events that appear to be randomly orientated."

In particular, a discussion of how much individual traces might depart from this average behavior is absent and could be added. At the very least the spread of data should be indicated (see point 2 below). I think that a discussion of this issue would really add to the results here, right now the model put forward at the end in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> is one of a clock that runs and determines the switching dynamics, leaving the reader with the impression that this is a rather deterministic process. In reality switching is governed by stochastic events, the 'clock' probably is the characteristic timescale of some biochemical reaction and the variance will be as large as the characteristic timescale. Thus, the variance in the behavior of individual switching events will be large, (probably) consistent with the data here. In other words you need to clearly highlight the stochastic nature of the entire process (after all, the switching order is highly stochastic)."

It would be interesting if you commented on the standard deviation of the curves. In particular, it would be interesting if the standard deviation after a switching event is very small after a TIDS or LIDS switching event. This would further support your claim that the behavior after a switch is very similar. Moreover, an examination of the spread in the data may indicate variables that could be of importance. For instance, is the spread Gaussian or does it show a bi-modal distribution. If the behavior after a TIDS or a LIDS is different, you may expect the distribution of curves to be bi-modal with a peak centered at each type of behavior."

In particular, a discussion of how much individual traces might depart from this average behavior is absent and could be added. At the very least the spread of data should be indicated (see point 2 below). I think that a discussion of this issue would really add to the results here, right now the model put forward at the end in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> is one of a clock that runs and determines the switching dynamics, leaving the reader with the impression that this is a rather deterministic process. In reality switching is governed by stochastic events, the 'clock' probably is the characteristic timescale of some biochemical reaction and the variance will be as large as the characteristic timescale. Thus, the variance in the behavior of individual switching events will be large, (probably) consistent with the data here. In other words you need to clearly highlight the stochastic nature of the entire process (after all, the switching order is highly stochastic).</i> "

This shows that the distributions have a large variance and are approximately Gaussian. Unfortunately, there is no bimodality apparent in these distributions.

It would be interesting if you commented on the standard deviation of the curves. In particular, it would be interesting if the standard deviation after a switching event is very small after a TIDS or LIDS switching event. This would further support your claim that the behavior after a switch is very similar. Moreover, an examination of the spread in the data may indicate variables that could be of importance. For instance, is the spread Gaussian or does it show a bi-modal distribution. If the behavior after a TIDS or a LIDS is different, you may expect the distribution of curves to be bi-modal with a peak centered at each type of behavior.</i> "
