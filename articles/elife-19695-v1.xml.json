To investigate the network-level mechanisms that underlie these dynamics, we developed novel computational techniques to fit a deterministic spiking network model directly to multi-neuron recordings from different rodent species, sensory modalities, and behavioral states. The model generated correlated variability without external noise and accurately reproduced the diverse activity patterns in our recordings. Analysis of the model parameters suggested that differences in noise correlations across recordings were due primarily to differences in the strength of feedback inhibition. Further analysis of our recordings confirmed that putative inhibitory neurons were indeed more active during desynchronized cortical states with weak noise correlations. Our results demonstrate that network models with intrinsically-generated variability can accurately reproduce the activity patterns observed in multi-neuron recordings and suggest that inhibition modulates the interactions between intrinsic dynamics and sensory inputs to control the strength of noise correlations."

To investigate the network-level mechanisms that underlie these dynamics, we developed novel computational techniques to fit a deterministic spiking network model directly to multi-neuron recordings from different rodent species, sensory modalities, and behavioral states. The model generated correlated variability without external noise and accurately reproduced the diverse activity patterns in our recordings. Analysis of the model parameters suggested that differences in noise correlations across recordings were due primarily to differences in the strength of feedback inhibition. Further analysis of our recordings confirmed that putative inhibitory neurons were indeed more active during desynchronized cortical states with weak noise correlations. Our results demonstrate that network models with intrinsically-generated variability can accurately reproduce the activity patterns observed in multi-neuron recordings and suggest that inhibition modulates the interactions between intrinsic dynamics and sensory inputs to control the strength of noise correlations."

Yet most of our knowledge of how the brain works comes from studying the activity of one neuron at a time. Recently, studies of multiple neurons have shown that they tend to be active together in short bursts called \u201cup\u201d states, which are followed by periods in which they are less active called \u201cdown\u201d states. When we are sleeping or under a general anesthetic, the neurons may be completely silent during down states, but when we are awake the difference in activity between the two states is usually less extreme. However, it is still not clear how the neurons generate these patterns of activity."

The experiments recorded electrical activity from many neurons at the same time and found a wide range of different activity patterns. A computational model based on these data suggests that differences in the degree to which some neurons suppress the activity of other neurons may account for this variety. Increasing the strength of these inhibitory signals in the model decreased the fluctuations in electrical activity across entire areas of the brain. Further analysis of the experimental data supported the model\u2019s predictions by showing that inhibitory neurons \u2013 which act to reduce electrical activity in other neurons \u2013 were more active when there were fewer fluctuations in activity across the brain."

However, these patterns are driven not only by sensory inputs, but also by the intrinsic dynamics of the underlying cortical network. These dynamics can create correlations in the activity of neuronal populations with important consequences for coding and computation (<a href=\"#bib93\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott and Dayan, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Averbeck et al., 2006</a>). The correlations between pairs of neurons have been studied extensively (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ecker et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Averbeck et al., 2006</a>), and recent studies have demonstrated that they are driven by dynamics involving coordinated, large-scale fluctuations in the activity of many cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib85\">Sakata and Harris, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Pachitariu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Okun et al., 2015</a>). Inactivation of the cortical circuit suppresses these synchronized fluctuations at the level of the membrane potential, in both awake and anesthetized animals, suggesting that this synchronization is cortical in origin (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen-Kashi Malina et al., 2016</a>). Importantly, the nature of these dynamics and the correlations that they create are dependent on the state of the underlying network; it has been shown that various factors modulate the strength of correlations, such as anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib40\">Harris and Thiele, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Sch\u00f6lvinck et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Constantinople and Bruno, 2011</a>), attention (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Mitchell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buran et al., 2014</a>), locomotion (<a href=\"#bib90\">Schneider et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Erisken et al., 2014</a>), and alertness (<a href=\"#bib101\">Vinck et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">McGinley et al., 2015a</a>). In light of these findings, it is critical that we develop a deeper understanding of the origin and coding consequences of correlations at the biophysical network level."

Models that use external noise to create correlations have been used in theoretical investigations of how network dynamics can transform correlations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Doiron et al., 2016</a>), but no physiological source for the external noise used in these models has yet been identified. However, no external noise is needed to generate the correlated activity that is observed in vivo; in vitro experimental studies have shown that cortical networks are capable of generating large-scale fluctuations intrinsically (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</a>), and in vivo results suggest that the majority of cortical fluctuations arise locally (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen-Kashi Malina et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Shapcott et al., 2016</a>).

No existing model satisfies all of these criteria; the only network models that have been fit directly to multi-neuron recordings have relied on either abstract dynamical systems (<a href=\"#bib23\">Curto et al., 2009</a>) or probabilistic frameworks in which variability is modelled as stochastic and correlated variability arises through abstract latent variables whose origin is assumed to lie either in unspecified circuit processes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ecker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Macke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Pachitariu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Pillow et al., 2008</a>) or elsewhere in the brain (<a href=\"#bib36\">Goris et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">de la Rocha et al., 2007</a>).

These networks can be designed to have interpretable parameters, but have not been shown to internally generate large-scale fluctuations and noise correlations of the kind routinely seen in multi-neuron recordings. Networks with structured connectivity have been shown to generate correlated activity in small groups containing less than 5% of all neurons (<a href=\"#bib52\">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</a>), but not in the entire network. Furthermore, large-scale neural network models have not yet been fit directly to multi-neuron recordings and, thus, their use has been limited to attempts to explain qualitative features of cortical dynamics through manual tuning of network parameters. This inability to fit the networks directly to recordings has made it difficult to identify which of these network features, if any, play an important role in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we used a novel computational approach that allowed us to fit spiking networks directly to individual multi-neuron recordings. By taking advantage of the computational power of graphics processing units (GPUs), we were able to simulate the network with millions of different parameter values for 900 seconds each to find those that best reproduced the structure of the activity in a given recording."

Our results suggest that weak inhibition allows activity to be dominated by coordinated, large-scale fluctuations that cause the state of the network to vary over time and, thus, create variability in the responses to successive stimuli that is correlated across neurons. In contrast, when inhibition is strong, these fluctuations are suppressed and the network state remains constant over time, allowing the network to respond reliably to successive stimuli and eliminating noise correlations."

The autocorrelation function of the MUA decayed quickly to zero for recordings with weak large-scale fluctuations, but had oscillations that decayed slowly for recordings with stronger fluctuations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). The activity patterns in recordings with strong large-scale fluctuations were characterized by clear transitions between up states, where most of the population was active, and down states, where the entire population was silent. These up and down state dynamics were reflected in the distribution of the MUA across time bins; recordings with strong large-scale fluctuations had a large percentage of time bins with zero spikes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>)."

While there were some dependencies in the values of these quantities across different recordings (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>), there was also considerable scatter both within and across recording types. This scatter suggests that there is no single dimension in the space of cortical dynamics along which the overall level of activity and the spatial and temporal structure of the activity patterns all covary, but rather that cortical dynamics span a multi-dimensional continuum (<a href=\"#bib40\">Harris and Thiele, 2011</a>). This was confirmed by principal component analysis; even in the already reduced space described by our summary statistics, three principal components were required to account for the differences in spike patterns across recordings (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>)."

We constructed a minimal deterministic network of excitatory spiking integrate-and-fire neurons with non-selective feedback inhibition and single-neuron adaptation currents (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Each neuron receives constant tonic input, and the neurons are connected randomly and sparsely with 5% probability. The neurons are also coupled indirectly through global, supralinear inhibitory feedback driven by the spiking of the entire network (<a href=\"#bib83\">Rubin et al., 2015</a>), reflecting the near-complete interconnectivity between pyramidal neurons and interneurons in local populations (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hofer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Fino and Yuste, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Packer and Yuste, 2011</a>). The supralinearity of the inhibitory feedback is a critical feature of the network, as it shifts the balance of excitation and inhibition in favor of inhibition when the network is strongly driven, as has been observed in awake animals (<a href=\"#bib38\">Haider et al., 2013</a>)."

The variability in the model arises through chaotic amplification of small changes in initial conditions or small perturbations to the network that cause independent simulations to diverge. In some parameter regimes, the instability of the network is such that the structure of the spike patterns generated by the model is sensitive to changes in the spike times of individual neurons. In fact, a single spike added randomly to a single neuron during simulated activity is capable of changing the time course of large-scale fluctuations, in some cases triggering immediate population-wide spiking (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>, top rows). Similar phenomena have been observed in vivo previously (<a href=\"#bib54\">London et al., 2010</a>) and were also evident in our recordings when comparing different extracts of cortical activity; spike patterns that were similar for several seconds often then began to diverge almost immediately (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>, bottom rows)."

The results of these parameter sweeps clearly demonstrate that each of the five parameters can exert strong control over the dynamics of the network, as both the overall level of activity and the spatial and temporal structure of the patterns in simulated activity varied widely with changes in each parameter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013d</a>)."

In this regime, the amplification of a small perturbation results in a sustained, prolonged burst of activity (up state), which, in turn, drives a build-up of adaptation currents that ultimately silences the network for hundreds of milliseconds (down state) until the cycle repeats. These fluctuations can be suppressed by an increase in the strength of feedback inhibition, which eliminates slow fluctuations and shifts the network into a regime with weak, tonic spiking and weak correlations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013d</a>, first column); in this regime, small perturbations are immediately offset by the strong inhibition and activity is returned to baseline. Strong inhibition also offsets externally-induced perturbations in balanced networks (<a href=\"#bib81\">Renart et al., 2010</a>), but in our model such perturbations are internally-generated and would result in runaway excitation in the absence of inhibitory stabilization. The fluctuations between up and down states can also be suppressed by decreasing adaptation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013d</a>, second column); without adaptation currents to create slow, synchronous fluctuations across the network, neurons exhibit strong, tonic spiking."

Increasing the strength of excitation results in increased activity and stronger fluctuations, as inhibition is unable to compensate for the increased amplification of small perturbations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013d</a>, third column). Increasing the spread or baseline level of tonic input also results in increased activity, but with suppression, rather than enhancement, of slow fluctuations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013d</a>, fourth and fifth column). As either the spread or baseline level of tonic input is increased, more neurons begin to receive tonic input that is sufficient to overcome their adaptation current and, thus, begin to quickly reinitiate up states after only brief down states and, eventually, transition to tonic spiking."

To mitigate this problem, we designed our model to have a very small number of parameters and we fit three different functions of the recordings, two of which varied as a function of time or rank. To confirm that the analysis of parameter combinations other than those corresponding to the global minimum of the cost function for each recording would not lead to a different interpretation of our results, we also considered local minima in regions of parameter space that were distant from the global minimum. It is possible that such local minima correspond to parameter regimes that are qualitatively different from the global minimum, yet still capture the statistics of the recordings relatively well. We found the parameters corresponding to local minima did not consistently emphasize the role of any parameter other than inhibition; the strength of inhibitory feedback remained the dominant influence on noise correlations, even for local minima far removed from the global minimum.

The network parametrization is fundamentally nonlinear, and the statistics used in the cost function are themselves nonlinear functions of a dynamical system with discontinuous integrate-and-fire mechanisms. Thus, as no gradient information was available to guide the optimization, we used Monte Carlo simulations to generate activity and measure the relevant statistics with different parameter values. By using GPU computing resources, we were able to design and implement network simulations that ran 10000x faster than real time, making it feasible to sample the cost function with high resolution and locate its global minimum to identify the parameter configuration that resulted in activity patterns that best matched those of each recording. We also verified that the global minimum of the cost function could be identified with 10x fewer samples of simulated activity using a Gibbs sampling optimizer with simulated annealing (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but the results presented below are based on the global minima identified by the complete sampling of parameter space."

To estimate selectivity, we drove the model network that was fit to each cortical recording with external inputs constructed from IC responses to tones, and used the simulated responses to measure the width of the frequency tuning curves of each model neuron. Although each model network received the same external inputs, the selectivity of the neurons in the different networks varied widely. The average tuning width of the neurons in each network varied most strongly with the strength of the inhibitory feedback in the network (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>; partial <math id=\"inf19\"><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math> for inhibition: 0.74, excitation: 0.06, adaptation: 0.48, tonic input spread: 0.01, and tonic input baseline: 0.37), and varying the strength of inhibition alone was sufficient to drive large changes in tuning width (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>).

In particular, our results predict that inhibition should be strong in dynamical regimes with weak noise correlations. To test this prediction, we performed further analysis of our recordings to estimate the strength of inhibition in each recorded population. We classified the neurons in each recording based on the width of their spike waveforms (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The waveforms for all recording types fell into two distinct clusters, allowing us to separate fast-spiking (FS) neurons from regular-spiking (RS) neurons. In general, more than 90% of FS cortical neurons have been reported to be parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib69\">Nowak et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barth\u00f3 et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cho et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Madisen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Stark et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen and Mizrahi, 2015</a>), and this value approaches 100% in the deep cortical layers where we recorded (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cardin et al., 2009</a>). While the separation of putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons based on spike waveforms is imperfect (nearly all FS neurons are inhibitory, but a small fraction (less than 20%) of RS neurons are also inhibitory [<a href=\"#bib61\">Markram et al., 2004</a>]), it is still effective for approximating the overall levels of inhibitory and excitatory activity in a population."

It has been observed in vitro that population-wide fluctuations in neural activity persist without external input (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</a>). Such fluctuations also arise in vivo in localized cortical networks, in both awake and anesthetized animals, without feedforward inputs (<a href=\"#bib94\">Shapcott et al., 2016</a>) or any external inputs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen-Kashi Malina et al., 2016</a>). However, no previous models have been able to reproduce such large-scale coordinated activity in a deterministic network of connected neurons; previous models only reproduced single-neuron variability (<a href=\"#bib102\">Vogels and Abbott, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</a>). By fitting our spiking network model with adaptation currents directly to experimental recordings, we demonstrated that the model is able to reproduce the wide variety of multi-neuron cortical activity patterns observed in vivo without the need for external noise. Through chaotic amplification of small perturbations, the model generates activity with both trial-to-trial variability in the spike times of individual neurons and coordinated, large-scale fluctuations of the entire network. These fluctuations continue in the presence of sensory stimulation, thus creating noise correlations in a deterministic neural network."

In our network model, the coordinated, large-scale fluctuations that underlie this global dimension of variability are generated primarily by the interaction between recurrent excitation and adaptation. When inhibition is weak, small deviations from the mean spike rate can be amplified by strong, non-specific, recurrent excitation into population-wide events (up states). These events produce strong adaptation currents in each activated neuron, which, in turn, result in periods of reduced spiking (down states) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Latham et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Destexhe, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Curto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Mochol et al., 2015</a>). The alternations between up states and down states have an intrinsic periodicity given by the timescale of the adaptation currents, but the chaotic nature of the network adds an apparent randomness to the timing of individual events, thus creating intrinsic temporal variability. Several previous studies (<a href=\"#bib99\">Tsodyks et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Loebel et al., 2007</a>) have modelled alternations between up states and down states using synaptic depression rather than spike-frequency adaptation.

This history dependence creates a trial-to-trial variability in the total number of stimulus-evoked spikes that is propagated and reinforced across consecutive stimulus presentations to create noise correlations. However, when the strength of the inhibition in the network is increased, the inhibitory feedback is able to suppress some of the amplification by the recurrent excitation, and the transitions between clear up and down states are replaced by weaker fluctuations of spike rate that vary more smoothly over time. If the strength of the inhibition is increased even further, such that it becomes sufficient to counteract the effects of the recurrent excitation entirely, then the large-scale fluctuations in the network disappear, weakening the history dependence of evoked responses and eliminating noise correlations."

When inhibition is weak, every external input will eventually excite every neuron in the network because those neurons that receive the input directly will relay indirect excitation to the rest of the network. When inhibition is strong, however, the indirect excitation is largely suppressed, allowing each neuron to respond selectively to only those external inputs that it receives either directly or from one of the few other neurons to which it is strongly coupled. Thus, when inhibition is weak and the network is unstable, different external inputs will trigger similar population-wide events (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bathellier et al., 2012</a>), so the selectivity of the network in this regime is weak and its ability to encode differences between sensory stimuli is poor. In contrast, when inhibition is strong and the network is stable, different external inputs will reliably drive different subsets of neurons, and the activity patterns in the network will encode different stimuli with high selectivity and enable accurate decoding."

However, other experiments have shown that the membrane potential of cortical neurons in behaving animals can also be strongly hyperpolarized with clear fluctuations between up and down states (<a href=\"#bib84\">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Tan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">McGinley et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Polack et al., 2013</a>) (for a table listing the species and brain area investigated in each of these studies, see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

Locomotion in particular tends to depolarizate cortical neurons, and in some cases increases tonic spiking (<a href=\"#bib68\">Niell and Stryker, 2010</a>). In contrast, task-engagement in stationary animals has been associated with hyperpolarization and suppression of activity (<a href=\"#bib62\">McGinley et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Otazu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buran et al., 2014</a>) (but not all studies find a decrease in membrane potential during task engagement [<a href=\"#bib84\">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</a>]). The existence of two different dynamical regimes with weak noise correlations was also apparent in our recordings; while some recordings with weak noise correlations resembled the classical asynchronous state with spontaneous activity consisting of strong, tonic spiking (e.g. desynchronized urethane recordings and some awake recordings), other recordings with weak noise correlations exhibited a suppressed state with relatively low spontaneous activity that contained clear, albeit weak, up and down states (e.g. FMM recordings and other awake recordings). Our model was able to accurately reproduce spontaneous activity patterns and generate evoked responses with weak noise correlations in both of these distinct regimes."

Since large-scale fluctuations arise from the synchronization of adaptation currents across the population, reducing the strength of adaptation diminishes the fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib25\">Destexhe, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Curto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Mochol et al., 2015</a>). Increasing tonic input also diminishes large-scale fluctuations, but in a different way (<a href=\"#bib48\">Latham et al., 2000</a>); when a subset of neurons receive increased tonic input, their adaptation currents may no longer be sufficient to silence them for prolonged periods, and the activity of these neurons during what would otherwise be a down state prevents the entire population from synchronizing. When the network in the asynchronous state is driven by an external input, it responds reliably and selectively to different inputs. Because the fluctuations in the network are suppressed and its overall level of activity remains relatively constant, every input arrives with the network in the same moderately-adapted state, so there is no history dependence to create noise correlations in evoked responses."

The fluctuations in the hyperpolarized network are only suppressed when the network is driven by external input. In our model, this suppression of the correlated variability in evoked responses is caused by the supralinearity of the feedback inhibition (<a href=\"#bib83\">Rubin et al., 2015</a>). The level of spontaneous activity driven by the tonic input to each neuron results in feedback inhibition with a relatively low gain, which is insufficient to suppress the fluctuations created by the interaction between recurrent excitation and adaptation. However, when the network is strongly driven by external input, the increased activity results in feedback inhibition with a much higher gain, which stabilizes the network and allows it to respond reliably and selectively to different inputs. This increase in the inhibitory gain of the driven network provides a possible mechanistic explanation for the recent observation that the onset of a stimulus quenches variability (<a href=\"#bib14\">Churchland et al., 2010</a>) and switches the cortex from a synchronized to a desynchronized state (<a href=\"#bib97\">Tan et al., 2014</a>), as well as for\u00a0the suppression of responses to high-contrast stimuli in alert animals (<a href=\"#bib110\">Zhuang et al., 2014</a>)."

In vitro studies have shown that pharmacologically reducing inhibition increases the strength of the correlations between excitatory neurons in a graded manner (<a href=\"#bib95\">Sippy and Yuste, 2013</a>). In vivo whole-cell recordings in awake animals have demonstrated that the stimulus-evoked inhibitory conductance, measured at the soma, is much larger than the corresponding excitatory conductance (<a href=\"#bib38\">Haider et al., 2013</a>). This strong inhibition in awake animals quickly shunts the excitatory drive and results in sharper tuning and sparser firing than the balanced excitatory and inhibitory conductances observed under anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib103\">Wehr and Zador, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Haider et al., 2013</a>). During locomotion, fluctuations in activity are reduced and both inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons increase their firing, but inhibitory neurons are modulated more strongly in our recordings (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

Any interneuron population that exerts a net inhibitory effect on pyramidal neurons could act to suppress large-scale fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib78\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>).

In addition, optogenetic activation of cholinergic projections to cortex resulted in increased firing of SOM+ inhibitory neurons and reduced slow fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). The release of NE in cortex through microdialysis had similar effects, increasing fast-spiking activity and reducing spontaneous spike rates (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castro-Alamancos and Gulati, 2014</a>), while blocking NE receptors strengthened slow fluctuations in membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib20\">Constantinople and Bruno, 2011</a>).

However, while such complex simulations may be able to capture the relevant properties of a circuit and replicate features of its neural activity in detail, they may not necessarily provide direct insight into the general mechanisms that underlie the circuit's function. Thus, a complementary stream of research is needed to seek minimal functional, yet physiologically-based, models that are capable of reproducing relevant phenomena. The model we have investigated here includes only a very restricted set of physiological properties, yet is able to reproduce a wide range of dynamics observed across different species, brain areas, and behavioral states. This simple model provides a compact and intuitive description of the circuit mechanisms that are capable of coordinated dynamics in networks with intrinsic variability. We have already shown that the same mechanisms can also control the dynamics of more complex functional models, but further work is needed to develop methods to bridge the gap between functional models and large-scale digital reconstructions."

A small metal rod was mounted on the skull and used to secure the head of the animal in a stereotaxic device in a sound-attenuated chamber. A craniotomy was made over the primary auditory cortex, an incision was made in the dura mater, and a 32-channel silicon multi-tetrode array was inserted into the brain. Only recordings from A1 were analyzed. Recordings were made between 1 and 1.5 mm from the cortical surface (most likely in layer V). All gerbils recorded were used in this study, except for one gerbil under FMM which exhibited little to no neural activity during the recording period."

A separate network was simulated on each of the 8 or 15 multiprocesssors available (video cards were GTX 690 or Titan Black). Low-level CUDA code was interfaced with Matlab via mex routines."

Briefly, the sampling-based optimization is based on defining the energy landscape as the negative of the cost function, and thus defining a probability distribution over parameters <math id=\"inf83\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mtext>P</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo>\u2212</mo><mtext>Cost</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mrow><mo>/</mo></mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mstyle></math>, where <math id=\"inf84\"><mi>T</mi></math> is the temperature.

The stimulus was either human speech (as presented during our gerbil A1 recordings) or pure tones. The external input to the network was constructed using recordings from 563 neurons from the inferior colliculus (IC). For all recordings in the IC the mean pairwise noise correlations were near-zero and the Fano Factors of individual neurons were close to 1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Garcia-Lazaro et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that responses of IC neurons on a trial-by-trial basis are fully determined by the stimulus alone, up to Poisson-like variability. Thus, we averaged the responses of IC neurons over trials and drove the cortical network with this trial-averaged IC activity. We binned IC neurons by their preferred frequency in response to pure tones, and drove each model cortical neuron with a randomly chosen subset of 10 neurons from the same preferred-frequency bin. We rescaled the IC activity so that the input to the network had a mean value of 0.06 and a maximum value of 0.32, which was three times greater than the average tonic input."

The classifier was built on training data using a linear discriminant formulation in which the Gaussian noise term was replaced by Poisson likelihoods. Specifically, the activity of a neuron for each 15 ms bin during the response to each token was fit as a Poisson distribution with the empirically-observed mean. To decode the response to a test trial, the likelihood of each candidate token was computed and the token with the highest likelihood was assigned as the decoded class. This classifier was chosen because it is very fast and can be used to model Poisson-like variables, but we also verified that it produced decoding performance as good as or better than classical high-performance classifiers like support vector machines."

The distribution of synchrony values was not clearly bimodal, but varied across a continuum of relatively synchronized and desynchronized states. To examine the effect of synchrony on noise correlations, we sorted all trials by their synchrony value, classified the 50% of trials with the lowest values as desynchronized and the 50% of trials with the highest values as synchronized, and computed the noise correlations for each set of trials for each recording. To examine the effect of synchrony on FS and RS activity, we pooled all trials from all recordings, divided them into quintiles by their synchrony value, and computed the average spike rates of FS and RS neurons for each set of trials. For <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, noise correlations were computed aligned to the stimulus onsets in windows of 500 ms, to match the window used for measuring FS and RS activity as well as LFP power."

In order to discard extremely small speeds that may be noise, we discarded all points less than one hundredth of the standard deviation of the running speed. Using the processed running speed, we divided the data into periods of stationary and running behavior. We found periods of at least five seconds in which all bins were either zero or non-zero. We then excluded the first and last second of each of these segments from our computations, considering them to be periods of transition between stationary and running. We took all of the spiking in these segments and binned it into 15 ms bins for all further computations."

We computed the mean evoked response to each stimulus (10 stimuli total) for each neuron by computing the mean response across all trials and then subtracting the spontaneous spike rate. We then subtracted this mean evoked response from each neurons response on each trial. Because the spike rates of neurons varied from 0.1 Hz (our cutoff for inclusion) to 150 Hz, we divided each neuron's binned spike rate by its average spike rate and then multiplied by the overall mean spike rate of the population. We then computed each of our statistics on these normalized population activity patterns. We fit the models to the statistics of the stationary periods in each of the recordings, and then changed one or two parameters of the stationary fits in order to best fit the running periods. We simulated evoked activity by driving the model with the mean evoked responses described above, scaled so that the overall spike rate of the model responses matched the overall spike rate in each recording."

They construct a spiking network model that can generate Up/Down dynamics internally (the mechanism is that neurons' afterhyperpolarizations chaotically synchronize) by systematically varying a handful of key parameters of the model. They predict that the main feature determining whether Up/Down dynamics are prominent is the strength of feedback inhibition. They then test this prediction by comparing activity of fast-spiking versus broad-spiking units in the original data, and they see that FS units are indeed more responsive during desynchronized trials or under fentanyl, versus on synchronized trials or under ketamine."

Fanselow/Connors 2008 showed that the states in which somatostatin cells were active tended to be those in which parvalbumin cells were least active, and in fact Tan/Agmon 2008 suggest that non-FS inhibitory cells (somatostatin cells) are the ones most specialized to provide the kind of stabilizing influence the authors' models require."

Many factors can influence how many units/clusters are recovered from a recording and how well spikes are assigned to their underlying sources, including physical/pulsatile instability of the brain caused by breathing and heart rate, overall activity level of nearby neurons (which influences both cluster quality and SD-based spike thresholds), and correlation/synchrony (most sorters don't properly handle \"collisions\" between spikes in neighboring cells). Anesthesia could change any of these. Even though the physical configuration of the tetrode was the same, it is unclear how one could control for all of these issues when comparing two extracellular recordings."

Short-term synaptic plasticity is an equally important factor in determining a neuron's ability to affect firing in its targets. This could even be a mechanism for maintaining the supralinearity of inhibition; if inhibitory synapses don't depress as much as excitatory synapses do, they'll still be capable of stabilizing the network even when the network is very active, producing an inhibition-stabilized network in which the number of inhibitory spikes doesn't increase faster than the number of excitatory spikes (see e.g. Tan/Agmon 2008). In the converse case, in a network in which excitatory synapses depress less than inhibitory synapses, the network could appear inhibition-stabilized in its spike count and yet not be inhibition-stabilized in terms of the overall magnitude of the inhibitory conductances. Either way, STSP is a key factor and spike rates are only half the story. The question is whether <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> really locks down the issue of whether cortical networks are actually inhibition-stabilized. It seems that the relationship between inhibition-stabilized networks and STSP is worth mentioning, even if only briefly."

Thus, the model approaches the upper limit for the explained variance in both the autocorrelation function of the MUA and the mean pairwise correlations. The small amount of variance in the distribution of MUA values across time bins that is unexplained by the model is due primarily to outliers in the distribution in the recordings corresponding to bursting activity.

In the revised manuscript, we now include analysis of new multi-neuron recordings from awake head-fixed mice that were able to run on a treadmill. It has been shown previously that locomotory behavior induces a more desynchronized cortical state (Polack et al., 2013), which we also verified in our new data. We separated these recordings into stationary and running epochs and asked which mechanisms in our model best explained the differences in cortical dynamics between these two behavioral states. The results were consistent with the rest of our analyses: we found that increases in inhibition best explained the change in dynamics, although an even better model of the transition between stationary and running periods was obtained by changes in both inhibition and adaptation. We also verified in these recordings that the relative increase in fast-spiking neuron activity that accompanied the desynchronization caused by running (87%) was significantly larger than the relative increase in regular-spiking activity (28%)."

Our analysis starts from the observation that feedback inhibition can be used to stabilize an otherwise oscillatory chaotic neural network. In real cortical networks, the overall level of feedback inhibition is likely to depend on multiple interneuron classes, perhaps with different interneuron classes playing more or less important roles in different situations. We found that the behavior of fast-spiking neurons in our data is at least consistent with a stabilization role in several situations, but our data do not enable us to assess the degree to which other interneuron classes may also be involved. We have revised the Discussion to propose the study of the roles of different interneuron classes in network stabilization as a topic for future work."

Note that these results are similar to those reported for the transition from synchronized to desynchronized states under urethane in the original manuscript. Desynchronization under urethane is similar to desynchronization during running in that the spike rates of both FS and RS neurons increase, with the increase in FS activity being proportionally larger. In the case of urethane, the increase in RS activity despite increased FS activity appears to be due to an increase in tonic input."

This disinhibition may occur through a reduction in inhibitory activity: ketamine has been shown to reduce the immunoreactivity of GABAergic neurons in cortical slices (Kinney et al., 2006; Behrens et al., 2007). The Moore/Wehr 2013 study does not really speak directly to this question. In that study, the authors made no attempt to make an unbiased measurement of the overall level of inhibitory activity in the population under ketamine relative to any other state (or, indeed, at all). The same is true of Cohen/Mizrahi 2013: they may have randomly patched neurons, but they pre-selected cells for inclusion in their study based on a number of very specific criteria. This is also true of the more recent study from the same lab (Maor et al., Cer Cortex, 2016) in which they made targeted recordings from PV+ cells with visual guidance, but included only those cells with evoked responses in their analysis. So, in summary, neither existing data nor our own provide a reliable measurement of the overall level of inhibitory activity under ketamine relative to other states."

Their <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> suggests that their classification would have been more successful if they had used trough-to-peak. Moreover, Moore and Wehr also did not have a bimodal distribution of spike widths after filtering, which we reliably find in all 70+ of our recordings for trough-to-peak distributions."

This could even be a mechanism for maintaining the supralinearity of inhibition; if inhibitory synapses don't depress as much as excitatory synapses do, they'll still be capable of stabilizing the network even when the network is very active, producing an inhibition-stabilized network in which the number of inhibitory spikes doesn't increase faster than the number of excitatory spikes (see e.g. Tan/Agmon 2008). In the converse case, in a network in which excitatory synapses depress less than inhibitory synapses, the network could appear inhibition-stabilized in its spike count and yet not be inhibition-stabilized in terms of the overall magnitude of the inhibitory conductances. Either way, STSP is a key factor and spike rates are only half the story.

But in a simplistic EI model, none of the potentially adapting synapses would have the effects that we observed on network activity and FS interneurons. The first possibility suggested by the reviewers is that inhibitory synapses might not depress as much as excitatory synapses. If this was true, then during desynchronization, the spike rates of inhibitory neurons would increase/decrease together with those of excitatory neurons, while the IE synapses would dominate over EE synapses, thus stabilizing the network. But in all cases, we observed that desynchronization caused a relative increase in FS activity that was larger than the corresponding relative increase in RS activity. The second possibility suggested by the reviewers is that excitatory synapses depress less than inhibitory synapses, thereby making the activity of inhibitory neurons large, even though their synapses are weak and unable to stabilize the dynamics. But we observe the opposite: the dynamics appear to be most stabilized in our recordings when FS activity is particularly high (desynchronized states)."
