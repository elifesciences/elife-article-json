Antigenic phenotype is often assessed through pairwise measurement of cross-reactivity between influenza strains using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Here, we extend previous approaches to antigenic cartography, and simultaneously characterize antigenic and genetic evolution by modeling the diffusion of antigenic phenotype over a shared virus phylogeny. Using HI data from influenza lineages A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, we determine patterns of antigenic drift across viral lineages, showing that A/H3N2 evolves faster and in a more punctuated fashion than other influenza lineages. We also show that year-to-year antigenic drift appears to drive incidence patterns within each influenza lineage. This work makes possible substantial future advances in investigating the dynamics of influenza and other antigenically-variable pathogens by providing a model that intimately combines molecular and antigenic evolution."

Antigenic phenotype is often assessed through pairwise measurement of cross-reactivity between influenza strains using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Here, we extend previous approaches to antigenic cartography, and simultaneously characterize antigenic and genetic evolution by modeling the diffusion of antigenic phenotype over a shared virus phylogeny. Using HI data from influenza lineages A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, we determine patterns of antigenic drift across viral lineages, showing that A/H3N2 evolves faster and in a more punctuated fashion than other influenza lineages. We also show that year-to-year antigenic drift appears to drive incidence patterns within each influenza lineage. This work makes possible substantial future advances in investigating the dynamics of influenza and other antigenically-variable pathogens by providing a model that intimately combines molecular and antigenic evolution."

Further, a correlation was observed between antigenic drift and the number of new influenza cases per year for each flu strain.

Although individuals develop long-lasting immunity to particular influenza strains after infection, antigenic mutations to the influenza virus genome result in proteins that are recognized to a lesser degree by the human immune system, leaving individuals susceptible to future infection. The influenza virus population continually evolves in antigenic phenotype in a process known as antigenic drift. A large proportion of the disease burden of influenza stems from antigenic drift, which allows individuals to be infected multiple times throughout their lives. Although influenza vaccines may lack efficacy for a variety of reasons (<a href=\"#bib69\">Osterholm et al., 2012</a>), antigenic drift causes efficacy of a fixed vaccine formulation against circulating viruses to decline over time. A thorough understanding of the process of antigenic drift is essential to public health efforts to control mortality and morbidity through the use of a seasonal influenza vaccine."

In the case of influenza A, subtypes A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 refer to the genes, hemagglutinin (H or HA) and neuraminidase (N or NA), that are primarily responsible for the antigenic character of a strain. In the case of influenza B, Victoria (B/Vic) and Yamagata (B/Yam) refer to antigenically distinct lineages which diverged from a single lineage prior to 1980 (<a href=\"#bib75\">Rota et al., 1990</a>). Mutations to the HA1 region of the hemagglutinin protein are thought to drive the majority of antigenic drift in the influenza virus (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wiley et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Nelson and Holmes, 2007</a>). Experimental characterization of antigenic phenotype is possible through the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (<a href=\"#bib42\">Hirst, 1943</a>), which measures the cross-reactivity of one virus strain to serum raised against another strain through challenge or vaccination. Sera raised against older strains react poorly to more recent viruses resulting in new strains having a selective advantage over previously established strains."

The antigenic map of influenza A/H3N2 has shown substantial evolution of the influenza virus population since its emergence in 1968. Evolution of antigenic phenotype appears punctuated with episodes of more rapid innovation interspersed by periods of relative stasis, whereas genetic evolution appears more continuous (<a href=\"#bib79\">Smith et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that a relatively small number of genetic changes or combinations of genetic changes may drive changes in antigenic phenotype (<a href=\"#bib47\">Koel et al., 2013</a>). The process of antigenic drift results in the rapid turnover of the virus population, so that despite mutation, genetic diversity among contemporaneous viruses remains low. Such population turnover is supported by phylogenetic analysis that shows a characteristically \u2018spindly\u2019 tree with a single predominant trunk lineage and transitory side branches that persist for only 1\u20135 years (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fitch et al., 1997</a>)."

An antigenic map is constructed from a panel of HI measurements, and a phylogenetic tree is constructed from sequence data. However, the opportunity for a combined approach exists as both the antigenic map and the phylogenetic tree often contain many of the same isolates. Here, we implement a flexible Bayesian approach to jointly characterize the antigenic and genetic evolution of the influenza virus population. We apply this approach to investigate the dynamics of A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Vic and B/Yam viruses, and, for the first time, present detailed reconstructions of the antigenic dynamics of all four circulating influenza lineages."

In the BMDS model, a map distance of one antigenic unit translates to an expectation of a twofold drop in HI titer between virus and sera. Maps that produce pairwise distances most congruent with the observed titers will have a high likelihood and will be favored by the BMDS model. We integrate over sources of uncertainty, such as antigenic locations, in a flexible Bayesian fashion. We apply this model to HI measurements of virus isolates against post-infection ferret antisera for influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Vic and B/Yam."

In this case, \u2018serum potencies\u2019 are fixed to the maximum titers exhibited by particular ferret sera and give the baseline expectation for titer when virus and serum are antigenically identical. Potency differs between serum isolates due to experimental noise (e.g., variation in serum concentration), but also due to differential ferret immune responses, causing some serum isolates to inhibit hemagglutination at generally higher titers than other isolates. In this model, virus and serum locations follow an uninformative diffuse normal prior. After comparing models of differing dimensions, <a href=\"#bib79\">Smith et al.

The phylogenetic diffusion process acts as a prior on virus locations, so that genetically similar viruses are expected to share similar antigenic locations. The antigenic diffusion process includes both systematic drift with time and covariance induced by phylogenetic proximity. We examine the effects of including only systematic drift (model 6; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and systematic drift plus phylogenetic diffusion (model 7; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), finding a small increase in predictive accuracy of between 0.02 and 0.08 log<sub>2</sub> HI titers when both processes are included. The systematic drift process informs virus and serum locations by dates of isolation and the phylogenetic diffusion process informs virus locations by genetic sequences. Thus, in these models, antigenic locations are inferred using both genetic data and HI data and will differ from locations inferred from HI data alone. If HI data is rich, then we expect minor differences in antigenic locations with the inclusion of genetic data (as may be the case for A/H3N2), while if HI data is spare, then we expect genetic data to play a larger role in determining antigenic locations (as may be the case for B/Vic and B/Yam)."

However, if serum potency is fixed to the serum\u2019s maximum titer, this will often not be the case, as the virus giving the maximum titer may be antigenically distinct from the serum. Thus, fixing serum potencies will tend to under-estimate effect size; we observe a mean effect of 10.42 log<sub>2</sub> HI titers for A/H3N2 when fixing serum potencies and a mean of 10.94 when estimating serum potencies.

To solve this problem of identifiability, we assumed a weak prior that favors linear movement in the 2D antigenic space (present in models 6 through 9; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), with the slope of the linear relationship and the precision of the relationship incorporated into the Bayesian model (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

Cartographic methods allow complex HI datasets to be compressed to more approachable location-based summaries that quantify antigenic relationships between strains, including relationships not directly measured via HI. In this study, we provide a foundation for evolutionary antigenic cartography, which seeks to simultaneously assess antigenic phenotype and antigenic evolution. We use this approach to characterize competitive dynamics across influenza lineages A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Vic and B/Yam and show that antigenic evolution within each lineage drives strain replacement and contributes to seasonal incidence patterns. We find that influenza A/H3N2 evolves faster in antigenic phenotype than A/H1N1, which in turn evolves faster than B/Vic or B/Yam. Consequently, the influenza A/H3N2 virus population turns over more quickly than A/H1N1 or influenza B, exhibiting a smaller effective population size and a \u2018spindlier\u2019 phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, we observe a correlation between antigenic drift and viral incidence both across and within influenza lineages. The finding that antigenic evolution correlates with subsequent increased incidence within a lineage suggests a causal role for antigenic drift driving influenza incidence patterns. The correlation between incidence and drift further suggests the possibility of using HI data at the start of an influenza season to predict which lineage will subsequently predominate."

For example, our likelihood-based model facilitates the inclusion of possible covariates affecting immunological titer, which could include experimental factors such as red blood cell type used in the HI assay (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lin et al., 2012</a>) and whether oseltamivir is included in the HI reaction (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lin et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, this framework should be ideally suited to uncovering genetic determinants of antigenic change, as both the sequence state and antigenic location of internal nodes in the phylogeny may be estimated. In this fashion, it should be possible to correlate sequence substitutions directly to antigenic diffusion. Identifying viruses that will come to predominate in the global virus population while they are still at low frequency remains an enormous challenge. However, combining evolutionary and antigenic information may eventually prove useful in identifying low-frequency, but expanding, lineages of antigenically novel viruses that represent ideal targets for vaccine strain selection."

At heart, these assays compare the reactivity of one virus strain to antibodies raised against another virus strain via challenge or vaccination. In the case of HI, the measurement of cross-reactivity takes the form of a titer representing the dilution factor at which serum raised against a particular virus ceases to be effective at inhibiting the binding of another virus to red blood cells. These factors are commonly assessed by serial dilution, so that HI titers will form a log series, 40, 80, 160, etc\u2026.

Rather than taking the HI titer as 160, we can instead treat this as an interval measurement, assuming that the exact titer for inhibition would occur somewhere between 160 and 320.

If a strain had multiple sequences in the databases, we preferentially kept the IRD sequence and preferentially kept the longest sequence in IRD. Many strains had full length HA sequences, while other strains only possessed HA1 sequences. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.7 under default parameters (<a href=\"#bib21\">Edgar, 2004</a>). This dataset had 2051 influenza isolates (present as either virus or serum in HI comparisons) dating from 1968 to 2011. However, the majority of isolates were present from 2002 to 2007. Because we are interested in longer-term antigenic evolution, we subsampled the data to have at most 20 virus isolates per year, preferentially keeping those isolates with more antigenic comparisons. We then kept only those serum isolates that are relatively informative to the antigenic placement of viruses, dropping serum isolates that are compared to four or fewer different virus isolates. This censoring left 402 virus isolates, 519 serum isolates and 10,059 HI measurements. Each virus isolate was compared to an average of 21.9 serum isolates, and each serum isolate was compared to an average of 18.0 virus isolates."

Our prior on virus and serum locations remove much of this issue, orienting the antigenic map along dimension 1 and fixing it to begin at the origin. However, local isometries are often still a problem. For example, in A/H3N2 the HK/68, EN/72 and VI/75 clusters may rotate in relation to other clusters. Consequently, it may be difficult to fully align MCMC samples using Procrustes analysis. For the present study, we take a simple approach and sample a single MCMC step and visualize the antigenic locations at this state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Then, for specific quantities of interest, like rate of antigenic drift and rate of diffusion at different points along the phylogeny, we calculate the quantity across MCMC samples to yield an expectation and a credible interval.

Thus, after the MCMC is finished, we have a posterior sample of 2000 trees each tagged with estimated tip locations and internal node locations. We post-processed each posterior tree by conducting a linear interpolation between parent\u2013child node locations to arrive at <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values at intervals of 0.05 years for each virus.

To bring models into further alignment, we use a Uniform (\u2212100, 100) distribution over virus locations and serum locations. Unsurprisingly, we find that this BMDS model produces results that are strongly congruent with MDS results (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 10\u2014source data 1</a>). Antigenic cluster locations are consistent between methods (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013B</a>) and antigenic distances between pairs of viruses are consistent between temporally similar and temporally divergent viruses (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C\u2013E</a>), suggesting that the resulting maps are consistent at both local and global scales.

Because of this issue, and to more easily estimate rates of antigenic drift, we include a model of systematic drift in antigenic location that favors linear movement in the antigenic map. We find that including this drift prior on antigenic locations removes the problem of identifiability. Antigenic locations produced by this model remain locally consistent with MDS results between viruses \u223c15 years divergent, but global comparisons show that this BMDS model has partitioned more variance to the first antigenic dimension (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 12\u2014source data 1</a>). We additionally find that including the drift prior on antigenic locations often results in greater predictive power, with a slight improvement of test error for the A/H1N1, B/Vic, and B/Yam datasets (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Here, we investigate the impact on antigenic locations of estimating virus avidity and serum potency in the BMDS model. To isolate this difference, we use a Uniform (\u2212100, 100) prior on antigenic locations. Surprisingly, estimating virus avidity and serum potency results in a more linear antigenic map (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 13\u2014source data 1</a>), resembling the appearance of the map incorporating the antigenic drift prior, while preserving local consistency. We generally observe congruence between MDS and BMDS antigenic locations for viruses less than \u223c10 years divergent (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13E</a>). However, specific viruses may be affected, for instance A/Bilthoven/16,190/1968 (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C</a>), which appears more distant from all other viruses when serum and virus avidities are included."

The central issue, however, is that we are not convinced of a causal link between drift and incidence. The correlation between clades could simply be driven by the fact that H3N2 has more drift and higher incidence. Secondly, the correlation across years within a given clade could be driven by sampling biases. For example, if H1N1 is reported more than usual in a given year, it will typically have more isolates subjected to HI assays, which by itself might make it appear to have drifted more. (We note, however, that this issue might be addressable if the authors were to draw a random sample of the isolates such that the number per year were equal.)"

They also find that relative incidence is correlated with the rate of antigenic drift. However, this does not imply causality in terms of the higher average drift driving the higher average incidence. The authors do not claim any causality in this correlation between average drift and incidence in the four clades, and I am therefore fine with this part of the analysis. The problems arise in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>. The authors find a significant correlation between drift and incidence taken over all years and clades, and then use this to argue that drift drives incidence. I would agree with this conclusion if higher drift was associated with higher incidence with a correlation that is better than that obtained simply by comparing the averages of the four clades. But I don't think this is true. In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, the authors are averaging over all clades, making the correlation in 5A a trivial consequence of the fact that H3N2 has higher average incidence and drift. Even if the rate of drift and incidence were constant year-over-year for each clade (and simply differed among clades), the authors would observe the correlation that they report. Put another way; imagine that every year the drift and incidence in each clade was equal to its average. Then <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> would in effect correspond to simply recalculating the correlation between average drift and incidence in a scenario where each point is included as many times as there are years being examined. The more years that were included the higher the P-value would get because the number of data points would increase, but really the single actual trend (that H3N2 is higher in average drift and incidence) is just being counted multiple times. In order to draw a conclusion stronger that drift drives incidence, the authors need to show that incidence and drift are correlated within each clade individually, or else standardize the incidence so that the mean and variance for each individual clade is zero and one. It is not clear to me that there is any correlation between the drift and incidence within any of the individual clades. A similar problem affects <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> - for example, since H3N2 has the highest drift, it will always tend to be associated with lower drift in other clades since the other clades inherently have lower average drift. But this does not imply direct interference between clades. I am open to further discussion about this point, but I do not see how <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> implies that antigenic drift drives incidence, or that there is dynamical interference across clades. By the way, I do not think that a lack of correlation would be a disqualifying concern in terms of publication. Finding no evidence that antigenic drift drives incidence is just as important as finding that it does. But the claim needs to be correct."

In either case, what are the justifications for using absolute versus relative incidence? Also, why do they not analyze incidence prior to 1998/1999? Finally, because each influenza season spans two calendar years, why do they not break up the data by season rather than year?"

It suggests that there may be systematic differences between the sera. Can this be attributed to the serum itself (such as whether it is goat versus ferret), or to the particular lab or study? Could the authors correlate the estimated serum effects back to the originating source for that serum to check? As a related point, I was surprised that inclusion of the virus effects led to only minor improvement, since prior work (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19900932) suggests that some viruses are generally more resistant to HI than others. However, the virus effects are only included in a model (#9 in Table 1) where the serum effects are already included, and it is possible to imagine that including just one of these terms somehow helps correct for both effects. Can the authors include a tenth model in Table 1 that includes the virus effects but not the serum effects? This would clarify if serum effects are actually more important than virus effects, or simply whether inclusion of either one individually is more helpful than both together."

The authors also introduce a phenomonological model of antigenic variation based on diffusion, and interpret antigenic drift in terms of fitted diffusion coefficiants.

Indeed, the authors themselves note that the average predictive error of this new methods is comparable to that of Smith et al. (2004). What might be more valuable, perhaps, are the results relating inferred antigenic drift and influenza incidence each season, by clade. But these results are quite possibly driven by sampling biases (see below), and I am not really convinced of their validity \u2014 at least not without serious efforts to remove such sampling biases. Finally, the discussion of a \u201cdiffusion\u201d model of drift was extremely confusing to me, and the fitted diffusion coefficients do not have a clear meaning or interpretation."

They also find that relative incidence is correlated with the rate of antigenic drift. However, this does not imply causality in terms of the higher average drift driving the higher average incidence. The authors do not claim any causality in this correlation between average drift and incidence in the four clades, and I am therefore fine with this part of the analysis. The problems arise in</i> <a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5A</i></a><i>. The authors find a significant correlation between drift and incidence taken over all years and clades, and then use this to argue that drift drives incidence. I would agree with this conclusion if higher drift was associated with higher incidence with a correlation that is better than that obtained simply by comparing the averages of the four clades. But I don't think this is true. In</i> <a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5A</i></a><i>, the authors are averaging over all clades, making the correlation in 5A a trivial consequence of the fact that H3N2 has higher average incidence and drift. Even if the rate of drift and incidence were constant year-over-year for each clade (and simply differed among clades), the authors would observe the correlation that they report. Put another way; imagine that every year the drift and incidence in each clade was equal to its average. Then</i> <a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5A</i></a> <i>would in effect correspond to simply recalculating the correlation between average drift and incidence in a scenario where each point is included as many times as there are years being examined. The more years that were included the higher the P-value would get because the number of data points would increase, but really the single actual trend (that H3N2 is higher in average drift and incidence) is just being counted multiple times. In order to draw a conclusion stronger that drift drives incidence, the authors need to show that incidence and drift are correlated within each clade individually, or else standardize the incidence so that the mean and variance for each individual clade is zero and one. It is not clear to me that there is any correlation between the drift and incidence within any of the individual clades. A similar problem affects</i> <a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5B</i></a> <i>- for example, since H3N2 has the highest drift, it will always tend to be associated with lower drift in other clades since the other clades inherently have lower average drift. But this does not imply direct interference between clades. I am open to further discussion about this point, but I do not see how</i> <a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5</i></a> <i>implies that antigenic drift drives incidence, or that there is dynamical interference across clades. By the way, I do not think that a lack of correlation would be a disqualifying concern in terms of publication. Finding no evidence that antigenic drift drives incidence is just as important as finding that it does. But the claim needs to be correct</i>."

We see how differing overall incidence between clades could have given an artifactual signal in our previous year-to-year drift vs incidence comparisons. In this revision, we have reanalyzed the data in the way suggested; we show that year-to-year antigenic drift and incidence are correlated within each clade individually, arriving at correlation coefficients of 0.51, 0.29, 0.44 and 0.14 for A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Vic and B/Yam respectively. None of these correlations are significant on their own, however observing four correlation coefficients of this magnitude is highly unlikely under a null model derived from bootstrap permutations (p = 0.018). Because the increase in incidence tends to follow periods of pronounced antigenic drift, we conclude that there appears to be a causal relationship between antigenic change and increased incidence."
