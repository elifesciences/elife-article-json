                    "text": "Epithelial cells that lose attachment to the extracellular matrix undergo a specialized form of apoptosis called anoikis. Here, using large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screening, we find that KDM3A, a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) mono- and di-demethylase, plays a pivotal role in anoikis induction. In attached breast epithelial cells, <i>KDM3A</i> expression is maintained at low levels by integrin signaling. Following detachment, integrin signaling is decreased resulting in increased <i>KDM3A</i> expression. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>KDM3A</i> substantially reduces apoptosis following detachment and, conversely, ectopic expression of <i>KDM3A</i> induces cell death in attached cells. We find that KDM3A promotes anoikis through transcriptional activation of <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i>, which encode pro-apoptotic proteins. Using mouse models of breast cancer metastasis we show that knockdown of <i>Kdm3a</i> enhances metastatic potential. Finally, we find defective <i>KDM3A</i> expression in human breast cancer cell lines and tumors. Collectively, our results reveal a novel transcriptional regulatory program that mediates anoikis."

Here, using large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screening, we find that KDM3A, a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) mono- and di-demethylase, plays a pivotal role in anoikis induction. In attached breast epithelial cells, <i>KDM3A</i> expression is maintained at low levels by integrin signaling. Following detachment, integrin signaling is decreased resulting in increased <i>KDM3A</i> expression. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>KDM3A</i> substantially reduces apoptosis following detachment and, conversely, ectopic expression of <i>KDM3A</i> induces cell death in attached cells. We find that KDM3A promotes anoikis through transcriptional activation of <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i>, which encode pro-apoptotic proteins. Using mouse models of breast cancer metastasis we show that knockdown of <i>Kdm3a</i> enhances metastatic potential. Finally, we find defective <i>KDM3A</i> expression in human breast cancer cell lines and tumors. Collectively, our results reveal a novel transcriptional regulatory program that mediates anoikis."

Any epithelial cells that become detached from their natural surroundings die by a process called anoikis (a Greek word meaning \u201cbeing without a home\u201d). This process has an important role in preventing cancer from spreading around the body because it eliminates cells that are not in their proper environment. However, some cancers that start from epithelial cells, such as breast cancer, develop resistance to anoikis. Gaining a better understanding of the cellular factors that regulate anoikis, and how resistance develops, may reveal new drug targets for the treatment of breast cancer."

One of the factors Pedanou et al. identified is a protein called KDM3A that can remove small chemical groups (known as methyl groups) from histones \u2013 a process that is known to switch on genes. Further experiments show that epithelial cells in their natural surroundings only produce low levels of KDM3A, but that the levels of this protein increase if these cells become detached. This promotes anoikis by activating two genes called <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i> that induce cell suicide. However, KDM3A levels are low in human breast cancers, which suggests that these cancers become resistant to anoikis by preventing increases in KDM3A production."

Collectively, these findings reveal a new mechanism that triggers anoikis in normal breast epithelial cells and is disabled during breast cancer development. Future challenges are to identify factors that directly regulate the production of KDM3A, and to understand how these factors are manipulated in breast cancer cells to cause anoikis resistance."

Anoikis has an important role in preventing oncogenesis, particularly metastasis, by eliminating cells that lack proper ECM cues (<a href=\"#bib26\">Simpson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zhu et al., 2001</a>). Anoikis also functions to prevent the invasion of tumor cells into the luminal space, which is a hallmark of epithelial tumors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Debnath et al., 2002</a>). In general, epithelial-derived cancers, such as breast cancer, develop resistance to anoikis (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib23\">Schwartz, 1997</a>). Several signaling pathways have been shown to regulate anoikis (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib18\">Paoli et al., 2013</a>). In particular, anoikis is suppressed by integrin signaling, which functions through focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an activator of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (<a href=\"#bib13\">King et al., 1997</a>). FAK signaling is active in attached cells and is inactive following detachment (<a href=\"#bib9\">Frisch et al., 1996</a>). Anoikis is also suppressed by integrin-mediated, ligand independent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib17\">Moro et al., 1998</a>), which, like FAK, also stimulates RAF/MEK/ERK activity."

However, depletion of BIM or BMF diminishes but does not completely prevent anoikis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Reginato et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Schmelzle et al., 2007</a>), suggesting the existence of other factors and regulatory pathways that can promote anoikis. Moreover, the basis of anoikis resistance remains to be determined and to date has not been linked to alterations in expression or activity of BIM or BMF."

The screen was performed in MCF10A cells, an immortalized but non-transformed human breast epithelial cell line that has been frequently used to study anoikis (see, for example, <a href=\"#bib11\">Huang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Reginato et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Schmelzle et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Taube et al., 2006</a>). A genome-wide human small hairpin RNA (shRNA) library comprising ~62,400 shRNAs directed against ~28,000 genes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Silva et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Silva et al., 2005</a>) was divided into 10 pools, which were packaged into retroviral particles and used to stably transduce MCF10A cells. Following selection, the cells were divided into two populations, one of which was plated on poly-2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA)-coated plates for 10 days to inhibit cell attachment to matrix, and another that was cultured attached to matrix for 10 days as a control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Surviving cells were selected and shRNAs identified by deep sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of the two populations identified 26 shRNAs whose abundance was significantly enriched &gt;500-fold following detachment (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>); such shRNAs presumably confer upon MCF10A cells a selective advantage by protecting them from undergoing anoikis."

Detachment causes a disruption in integrin\u2013ECM contacts, resulting in a loss of FAK signaling in the detached cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Frisch and Francis, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Frisch et al., 1996</a>), which we observed have elevated KDM3A levels (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A and B</a>). We therefore tested whether restoration of integrin signaling in detached cells would block the increase in KDM3A levels. The results of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> show that the addition of Matrigel basement membrane-like matrix, which restores integrin signaling, to detached cells markedly blocked the elevated levels of the BIM isoform BIM<sub>EL</sub>, as expected, and KDM3A. Treatment of MCF10A cells with a FAK inhibitor increased the levels of KDM3A protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and mRNA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, the increase in KDM3A levels upon detachment of MCF10A cells is due, at least in part, to the loss of integrin/FAK signaling."

Consistent with these previous results, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> shows that in detached MCF10A cells, expression of either EGFR or MEK2DD substantially decreased the level of BIM<sub>EL</sub> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Reginato et al., 2003</a>). Expression of either EGFR or MEK2DD also decreased the levels of KDM3A in detached MCF10A cells. Conversely, KDM3A protein levels were increased in attached MCF10A cells treated with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barker et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ward et al., 1994</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) or the MEK inhibitor U0126 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Favata et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>).

To test this model and identify pro-apoptotic KDM3A target genes, we took a candidate-based approach and analyzed expression of a panel of genes encoding pro-apoptotic BCL2 proteins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boyd et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Lomonosova and Chinnadurai, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Matsushima et al., 1998</a>) in attached MCF10A cells and detached cells expressing a NS or <i>KDM3A</i> shRNA. We sought to identify genes whose expression increased following detachment in control but not in <i>KDM3A</i> knockdown cells. We found that expression of the vast majority of genes encoding pro-apoptotic BCL2 proteins were unaffected by detachment in MCF10A cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib19\">Reginato et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Schmelzle et al., 2007</a>), expression of <i>BIM</i> and <i>BMF</i> were increased upon detachment. However, knockdown of <i>KDM3A</i> did not decrease expression of either <i>BIM</i> or <i>BMF</i>. By contrast, following detachment, expression of <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i> increased, and were the only genes whose expression was diminished more than 2-fold by <i>KDM3A</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Moreover, the levels of H3K9me2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and H3K9me1 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) on the <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i> promoters were greatly diminished following detachment, which was counteracted by knockdown of <i>KDM3A</i>. Conversely, overexpression of KDM3A but not KDM3A(H1120G/D1122N) in attached MCF10A cells resulted in decreased levels of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 on the <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i> promoters and increased expression of <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Finally, knockdown of <i>BNIP3</i> or <i>BNIP3L</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) resulted in decreased apoptosis following detachment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). To further establish the pro-apoptotic role of BNIP3 and BNIP3L in MCF10A cells, we ectopically expressed BNIP3, BNIP3L or both in attached cells (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> shows that moderate cell death was observed upon ectopic expression of either BNIP3 or BNIP3L, but substantial cell death occurred in cells ectopically expressing both BNIP3 and BNIP3L. Collectively, these results establish <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i> as critical KDM3A target genes that mediate anoikis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>)."

We first analyzed a panel of human breast cancer cell lines (BT549, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, SUM149 and T47D) comparing, as a control, anoikis-sensitive MCF10A cells. As expected, detachment-induced apoptosis was significantly diminished in breast cancer cell lines compared to MCF10A cells, indicative of anoikis resistance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, following detachment of the breast cancer cell lines, induction of KDM3A at both the protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) levels was much lower than that observed in MCF10A cells. However, ectopic expression of KDM3A was sufficient to induce apoptosis in each of the five breast cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Collectively, these results indicate that anoikis-resistance of human breast cancer cells is due, at least in part, to inefficient induction of KDM3A following detachment."

Following detachment of non-transformed cells, integrin signaling is decreased leading to transcriptional induction of <i>KDM3A</i>. The increased levels of KDM3A results in its recruitment to the pro-apoptotic genes <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L,</i> where it promotes demethylation of inhibitory H3K9me1/2 marks and transcriptional activation of the two genes, resulting in anoikis induction. Consistent with this model, previous studies have shown that hypoxia results in transcriptional activation of <i>KDM3A, BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Sowter et al., 2001</a>). We have found that in anoikis-resistant human breast cancer cell lines and tumors, <i>KDM3A</i> expression is defective, highlighting the importance of this pathway in promoting anoikis. Collectively, our results reveal a novel transcriptional regulatory program that mediates anoikis in non-transformed cells and is disabled during cancer development."

However, we have found that unlike BNIP3 and BNIP3L, BIM and BMF are not regulated by KDM3A. Thus, our results reveal that anoikis is promoted by multiple non-redundant pathways, which may help prevent the development of anoikis resistance."

Animals that did not develop a primary tumor were excluded from the study. Tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: <i>\u03c0LW</i><sup>2</sup>/6, where <i>L</i> is the length and <i>W</i> is the width of the tumor. Tumors were surgically removed, using a cautery unit, once they reached a volume around 500 mm<sup>3</sup>, approximately 3 weeks post injection. Lungs were collected 8 weeks post-injection. Tumor burden in the lungs was quantified from four H&amp;E; stained step sections (200 \u00b5m/step). The number of lesions per section were counted using Imagescope software (Aperio, Vista, CA)."

KDM3A is transcriptionally induced upon cell detachment as a result of reduced integrin signaling through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the EGFR pathway via RAF/MEK/ERK and demethylates H3K9me2 on the promoters of the proapoptotic genes BNIP3 and BNIP3L resulting in their transcriptional induction and apoptosis. Further experiments provide clear evidence that KDM3A mRNA levels are generally kept lower in metastatic cell lines/tumors versus non-metastatic cell lines/tumors suggesting a mechanism by which detached cancer cells can avoid apoptosis and invade other tissues."

The experiments seem to carefully build on each other and delineate a clear mechanistic pathway from the beginning of cell detachment to apoptosis. Furthermore, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> provides relevant data highlighting the importance of the KDM3A/anoikis axis for the clinical setting.

There was also increased occupancy of KDM3A(H1120G/D1122N) on the <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i> promoters, which is not unexpected because the mutations are in the catalytic domain and should not affect the DNA-binding activity (Yamane et al. 2006, <i>Cell</i> 125:483-495; Beyer et al. 2008, <i>J Biol Chem</i> 283:36542-36552).
