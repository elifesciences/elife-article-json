Here, we show that <i>TP53</i> exon-6 truncating mutations occur at higher than expected frequencies and produce proteins that lack canonical p53 tumor suppressor activities but promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Functionally and molecularly, these p53 mutants resemble the naturally occurring alternative p53 splice variant, p53-psi. Accordingly, these mutants can localize to the mitochondria where they promote tumor phenotypes by binding and activating the mitochondria inner pore permeability regulator, Cyclophilin D (CypD). Together, our studies reveal that <i>TP53</i> exon-6 truncating mutations, contrary to current beliefs, act beyond p53 loss to promote tumorigenesis, and could inform the development of strategies to target cancers driven by these prevalent mutations."

Here, we show that <i>TP53</i> exon-6 truncating mutations occur at higher than expected frequencies and produce proteins that lack canonical p53 tumor suppressor activities but promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Functionally and molecularly, these p53 mutants resemble the naturally occurring alternative p53 splice variant, p53-psi. Accordingly, these mutants can localize to the mitochondria where they promote tumor phenotypes by binding and activating the mitochondria inner pore permeability regulator, Cyclophilin D (CypD). Together, our studies reveal that <i>TP53</i> exon-6 truncating mutations, contrary to current beliefs, act beyond p53 loss to promote tumorigenesis, and could inform the development of strategies to target cancers driven by these prevalent mutations."

Genetic studies show that, in most tumors, <i>TP53</i> point mutations co-occur with the loss of one copy of the <i>TP53</i> gene (LOH) due to deletions in chromosome 17 where the <i>TP53</i> locus is located (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Menon et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Olivier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rivlin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2016</a>).

Knudson, experimental evidences have led to the description of <i>TP53</i> as a tumor suppressor gene (<a href=\"#bib18\">Knudson, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Finlay et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Donehower et al., 1992</a>)."

The high frequency of these mutations led to the hypothesis that these hotspot mutations could not only result in loss of function activities, but also could confer an advantage of growth to cancer cells. Indeed, many lines of evidence have now demonstrated that certain p53 missense mutants could exhibit a\u00a0gain of function activities during tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brosh and Rotter, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Oren and Rotter, 2010</a>). For instance, some of the gain of function mutations, including R175H, R248Q, R273H, resulted in an increase in cell invasion, cell migration, cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in different in-vitro models (<a href=\"#bib27\">Muller and Vousden, 2014</a>). Additionally, mice expressing <i>TP53</i> R172H (human R175H) and R270H (human R273H) mutations manifest a broad spectrum of aggressive tumors that are more metastatic in nature when compared to p53-null mice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Olive et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Doyle et al., 2010</a>). Though different gain of function mutants exhibit various pro-tumorigenic phenotypes, their mechanism of function mostly relies on alterations to the p53 transcription program (<a href=\"#bib12\">Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012</a>)."

In fact, we observed that <i>TP53</i> exon-6 truncating mutations occur at higher than expected frequencies and, when ectopically expressed in cells, induce the acquisition of pro-metastatic features. In contrast to <i>TP53</i> missense gain of function mutations, we found that <i>TP53</i> exon-6 truncating mutations are necessary for cell survival in normal 2-D cell growing conditions. These <i>TP53</i> truncating mutations also different from a\u00a0canonical p53 missense gain of function mutants in regards to their mode of action. As we have shown in this study, these p53 mutants lack transcriptional activity and, instead, have phenotypes that depend on their molecular and functional interactions with Cyclophilin D in the mitochondria."

As indicated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, we found that in the case of missense mutations the relative expected frequency was 0.34, while the relative observed frequency was 0.64, based on the analysis of the TCGA cohort. This finding suggests that missense mutations are observed at a frequency that is 1.9 fold higher than expected. In the case of nonsense mutations, we observed a slight difference between the expected frequency (i.e., 0.054) and observed frequency (i.e., 0.084) of mutations. Interestingly, when we limited our analysis only to exon-6 nonsense mutations we found a 4\u20135 fold increase in the observed frequency compared to the expected frequency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This finding indicates that nonsense mutations in exon-6 occur nearly 5 times more frequently than all <i>TP53</i> mutations (p=3.869e-11) and 2\u20133 times more frequently than either missense mutations or nonsense mutations outside of exon-6 (p=3.71e-4 and p=8e-5, respectively).

The authors claim that p53 mutants lacking the DNA binding domain regulate mitochondrial membrane permeability (through MPTP activity) in a CypD-dependent manner. The data show that mutant p53 R213* binds to CypD but it is unclear whether this interaction occurs in the mitochondria or in the cytoplasm (if in the cytoplasm, it would imply that mutant p53 inhibits localization of CypD to the mitochondria which would explain its reduced mitochondrial localization in H1299 cells overexpressing R213* or R196*). Furthermore, it is unclear whether overexpression of CypD abolishes MPTP closure promoted by depletion of mutant p53 R213*. Therefore, the mechanistic and epistatic relationship between p53 truncated mutants and CypD must be explored in greater detail. Specific questions that must be answered experimentally are:"

Panel D \u2013 are these lentivirus-transduced cell lines or are they transiently transfected cells? If the latter, how were the transfected cells identified? The resolution of fluorescent images is poor, making it hard to see any morphological changes as described (subsection 'p53 exon-6 truncating mutants reprogram cells towards the acquisition of prometastatic Features', paragraph 2). Also, the DAPI stain cannot be seen properly in the R196*and R213* merges. Why is this? These images need to be improved or replaced. Why were A549 cells used rather than the H1299 p53 null cells? The null background avoids the confounder of p53 and its isoforms. Panel E \u2013 if the cells in D were transiently transfected, at which times were they assayed for EMT transcripts and were they always elevated? Panel F \u2013 it is hard to follow with the NS being on all box and whisper plots. Displaying this needs to be thought about more carefully. Also, again, why was the experiment not done in H1299 cells? Panel H \u2013 this does not measure metastasis; it measures colonization. The conclusions need to be altered.

The authors claim that p53 mutants lacking the DNA binding domain regulate mitochondrial membrane permeability (through MPTP activity) in a CypD-dependent manner. The data show that mutant p53 R213* binds to CypD but it is unclear whether this interaction occurs in the mitochondria or in the cytoplasm (if in the cytoplasm, it would imply that mutant p53 inhibits localization of CypD to the mitochondria which would explain its reduced mitochondrial localization in H1299 cells overexpressing R213* or R196*). Furthermore, it is unclear whether overexpression of CypD abolishes MPTP closure promoted by depletion of mutant p53R213*. Therefore, the mechanistic and epistatic relationship between p53 truncated mutants and CypD must be explored in greater detail. Specific questions that must be answered experimentally are:</i>"
