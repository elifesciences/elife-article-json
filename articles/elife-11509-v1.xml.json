This process \u2013 which is also used to regulate the expression of a plant\u2019s own genes \u2013 can be used to halt virus replication by directly modifying the way DNA is packaged in the cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Such packing is essential to fit all the genetic material inside the cell nucleus. However, a gene that is in a region of tightly wrapped DNA cannot be expressed. DNA and histones are often modified by the addition of chemical groups known as methyl groups. The pattern of \u201cmethylation\u201d in a region of the chromatin influences how tightly it is condensed. Therefore, it rules how highly the genes in that region are expressed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). To activate particular genes, the structure of the chromatin can be relaxed by altering the methylation pattern of its associated histones. However, unlike post-transcriptional gene silencing, researchers do not fully understand how plants use transcriptional gene silencing to defend themselves against viruses."

These viruses use host plant histones to pack their DNA and form structures called minichromosomes. Plants control Geminivirus infections by depositing repressive methylation marks into these minichromosomes. It is known that both the Geminivirus DNA and the associated histones are methylated in infected cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Raja et al., 2008</a>). Remarkably, Castillo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. show that an enzyme called KRYPTONITE binds to the minichromosomes in the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. This enzyme \u2013 which belongs to the SET domain family of methyltransferases \u2013 methylates the virus-associated histones and promotes DNA methylation: the end result is to condense the viral minichromosomes and stop virus replication."

Thus, it was thought that Geminiviruses avoid transcriptional gene silencing by reducing the cell\u2019s pool of methyl groups (<a href=\"#bib7\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). Using cleverly designed in vivo and in vitro experiments Castillo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. found that TrAP interacts with KRYPTONITE and blocks its enzymatic activity to relax the viral chromatin and allow the virus DNA to replicate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

However, plants that lack a working KRYPTONITE enzyme do not present those physical features, which suggest that TrAP may also block other enzymes belonging to the SET domain family in <i>A. thaliana</i>."

If that turns to be the case, the findings would be of great help to unravel the interactions between plants and viruses and how they have co-evolved. Some Geminiviruses, such as the Maize streak virus infect crops and can cause serious economical losses. The work from Castillo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. might point biotechnologists into new ways to create resistant plants."

This leads to the production of double stranded RNA molecules, which are processed by a DCL enzyme to produce virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs). These, in turn, trigger two defense mechanisms (black arrows) that aim to block virus replication. The vsiRNAs could be loaded into AGO1 and AGO2 enzymes to silence target viral mRNAs (known as post-transcriptional gene silencing), or could be loaded into AGO4 enzymes to direct DNA methylation (process called transcriptional gene silencing). KRYPTONITE (KYP), or another methyltranserase (MTase), methylates the histones in the viral minichromosome, which also promotes methylation of virus DNA. This results in the minichromosome becoming condensed, which blocks virus replication. However, many viruses produce suppressor proteins, such as TrAP, to counteract these defenses. TrAP blocks transcriptional gene silencing in two ways (red arrows): it inhibits the activity of the ADK enzyme leading to the accumulation of SAH (a molecule that blocks MTase activity) and a reduction in SAM (which is needed for methylation); TrAP can also directly bind to and inhibit the activity of KYP (and perhaps other MTases). Together these two process lead to the de-methylation of the minichromosome, which allows the virus to replicate.
