In the complex, Pol \u03b1 and primase cooperate in the production of RNA-DNA oligonucleotides that prime synthesis of new DNA. Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic core of yeast Pol \u03b1 in unliganded form, bound to an RNA primer/DNA template and extending an RNA primer with deoxynucleotides. We combine the structural analysis with biochemical and computational data to demonstrate that Pol \u03b1 specifically recognizes the A-form RNA/DNA helix and that the ensuing synthesis of B-form DNA terminates primer synthesis. The spontaneous release of the completed RNA-DNA primer by the Pol \u03b1/primase complex simplifies current models of primer transfer to leading- and lagging strand polymerases. The proposed mechanism of nucleotide polymerization by Pol \u03b1 might contribute to genomic stability by limiting the amount of inaccurate DNA to be corrected at the start of each Okazaki fragment."

In the complex, Pol \u03b1 and primase cooperate in the production of RNA-DNA oligonucleotides that prime synthesis of new DNA. Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic core of yeast Pol \u03b1 in unliganded form, bound to an RNA primer/DNA template and extending an RNA primer with deoxynucleotides. We combine the structural analysis with biochemical and computational data to demonstrate that Pol \u03b1 specifically recognizes the A-form RNA/DNA helix and that the ensuing synthesis of B-form DNA terminates primer synthesis. The spontaneous release of the completed RNA-DNA primer by the Pol \u03b1/primase complex simplifies current models of primer transfer to leading- and lagging strand polymerases. The proposed mechanism of nucleotide polymerization by Pol \u03b1 might contribute to genomic stability by limiting the amount of inaccurate DNA to be corrected at the start of each Okazaki fragment."

In eukaryotes, the process of DNA duplication occurs at multiple sites throughout the genome: at each site, the antiparallel strands of the parental DNA separate and provide a template for DNA polymerase (Pol), the enzyme that synthesizes the two new DNA strands. Duplication of the DNA proceeds in both directions from each site through the polymerization of nucleotides to form new strands of DNA that are complementary to the template strands. However, since DNA polymerases can only polymerize nucleotides in one direction, the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, synthesis of the so-called leading strand proceeds continuously, whereas the other, lagging strand is synthesized in fragments."

Production of the primers requires the concerted action of two more enzymes: an RNA polymerase known as primase, and another DNA polymerase called Pol \u03b1. It is known that completion of the RNA-DNA primer requires Pol \u03b1 to increase the length of the RNA segment by adding extra nucleotides, but the details of this process are poorly understood."

The RNA primers are extended in an obligate 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction by the replicative DNA polymerases that synthesize the bulk of chromosomal DNA. The initiation of DNA synthesis is made more complicated by the concurrent duplication of the antiparallel strands of parental DNA (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hamdan and van Oijen, 2010</a>). The repeated priming events necessary for the discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand require the constant activity of primase at the replication fork."

The molecular apparatus responsible for initiation of DNA synthesis in eukaryotic replication is more complex. The eukaryotic primase is a heterodimer of catalytic and regulatory subunits that is associated with the catalytic subunit of Pol \u03b1 and its accessory B subunit in a constitutive heterotetrameric assembly, the Pol \u03b1/primase complex (<a href=\"#bib34\">Loeb et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kaguni and Lehman, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Foiani et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lao-Sirieix et al., 2005b</a>).

The constitutive association of Pol \u03b1 and primase in the cell reflects presumably their tight functional coordination, demanded by the frequent priming necessary for lagging strand synthesis. Detailed knowledge of the mechanism of primer synthesis is lacking, but it must involves initiation, extension and completion of RNA synthesis by primase, intramolecular hand-off of the RNA oligonucleotide to Pol \u03b1 and limited RNA extension with deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brooks and Dumas, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kuchta et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Copeland and Wang, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sheaff and Kuchta, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sheaff et al., 1994</a>).

Before ligation of the completed Okazaki fragments, the RNA portion of the primer is excised by specific nucleases such as Fen1 and Dna2 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burgers, 2009</a>). The composite nature of the RNA-DNA primers poses a special challenge to the eukaryotic replication apparatus, that must further correct the DNA segment synthesized by Pol \u03b1, which lacks proofreading activity; current evidence indicates that the DNA portion of the primer might be corrected by Pol \u03b4 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pavlov et al., 2006</a>)."

We demonstrate that Pol \u03b1 recognizes the intrinsic and induced conformation of the A-form RNA primer/DNA template helix and that the resulting synthesis of B-form DNA forms the basis for a feedback mechanism of primer termination. Our findings provide a new paradigm for a critical step in the complex choreography of events that ultimately lead to replication of the lagging DNA strand."

The result of the structural study prompted us to investigate whether the polymerase activity of Pol \u03b1 reflected such specificity. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of the polymerase domain of yeast Pol \u03b1 to extend with deoxynucleotides a templated primer made of either RNA or DNA. Whereas Pol \u03b1 displayed only weak activity and limited processivity when extending a DNA primer, extension of an RNA primer resulted in much higher levels of polymerization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Strikingly, the profile of RNA-dependent extension products showed a pronounced peak at between 10 to 12 nucleotides, indicating strong processivity limited to a full-turn of double helix (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Such characteristics of the catalytic activity of Pol \u03b1 were observed for the isolated polymerase core as well as the Pol \u03b1 /primase complex and are independent of primer size (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

Elongation of the RNA primer with deoxynucleotides would cause translocation of the polymerase beyond the RNA/DNA duplex region and onto B-DNA, with loss of the RNA-specific contacts, eventually causing Pol \u03b1 to stall and terminate primer synthesis. We sought to test this mechanism of primer termination by design of DNA primer sequences with altered conformational properties. It is known that, although double-stranded DNA normally adopts a B-DNA conformation, its structure can display pronounced conformational variation depending on the local sequence of bases. Short runs of consecutive deoxyguanosine nucleotides can induce A-like DNA conformation in double-stranded DNA (<a href=\"#bib52\">Svozil et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Marathe et al., 2009</a>). We examined the ability of Pol \u03b1 to extend a templated oligo(dA) primer with increasing deoxyguanylate content, introduced incrementally as di- and tri-nucleotides. Indeed, as the deoxyguanosine content of the DNA primer increased, the size profile of the extension products synthesized by Pol \u03b1 changed from that expected of a DNA primer to that of an RNA primer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Further insight as to the possible structural basis for a termination mechanism can be obtained by comparing the structures of isolated and actively copying Pol \u03b1, which reveals a striking difference in the position of the thumb domain. In order to adopt the conformation observed in ternary complex, the thumb domain of Pol \u03b1 must rotate inwards by about 20\u00b0, a large conformational rearrangement compared for instance with the limited movement of the thumb domain observed in structures of isolated and copying RB69 Pol (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The large difference in the position of the thumb domain in the ternary complex and in the isolated polymerase suggests a molecular basis for the release of the completed primer-template by Pol \u03b1: loss of the interactions with the primer-template duplex would allow the thumb domain to rotate away from the DNA, terminating the productive engagement of the polymerase with its substrate."

The two copies of binary complex present in the asymmetric unit of the crystals capture intermediate states of the transition, as in one binary complex the conformation of region II is apo-like, whereas in the second copy region II adopts a conformation akin to that observed in the ternary complex. The range of positions adopted by the palm domain in the apo, binary and ternary complex structures suggests that adoption of an active conformation by Pol \u03b1 might require a wider set of conformational rearrangements than predicted by current models of DNA polymerase activity. The observed movement of the palm domain could participate in a \u2018ratchet' mechanism for unidirectional translocation of Pol \u03b1, as return of the palm domain to the apo conformation after catalysis would propel the polymerase forward onto the next templating base. Interestingly, site-specific mutations of Ser863 in region II of human Pol \u03b1 (Ser867 of yeast Pol \u03b1), which acts as the pivot during rotation of the palm domain, cause a drastic reduction in the specific activity of the polymerase without changing its kinetic parameters, in agreement with a potential structural role of this serine residue in DNA polymerisation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 1993</a>)."

Such a mechanism provides a straightforward model of primer hand-off in eukaryotic replication, by removing the need for molecular transactions between primer-bound Pol \u03b1 and the replicative apparatus deputed to leading and lagging strand synthesis. We note that, although the molecular details differ, the mechanism of primer release by Pol \u03b1 described here is conceptually similar to the mechanism of polymerase switching proposed for Pol \u03b7 after lesion by-pass (<a href=\"#bib3\">Biertumpfel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Silverstein et al., 2010</a>): for both polymerases, termination of DNA synthesis appears to be a direct consequence of the specific way in which they interact with their nucleic acid substrate."

Our work has highlighted a previously unappreciated functional similarity between primase and Pol \u03b1, as extension of an RNA primer by Pol \u03b1 leads to controlled termination of synthesis, in a functionally analogous manner to the known counting ability of primase. This functional symmetry in the behavior of the two polymerases responsible for priming DNA synthesis seems logical, as the lack of proof-reading ability by Pol \u03b1 poses a potential threat to genomic stability. Thus, in addition to excising the RNA portion of the primer, eukaryotic replication faces the additional challenge of correcting possible mismatches introduced by Pol \u03b1 in the DNA segment of the primer. How mistakes made by Pol \u03b1 are corrected by the replication apparatus has not been fully elucidated yet but current evidence points to a proofreading role of Pol \u03b4 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pavlov et al., 2006</a>).

The manuscript describes X-ray crystal structures of the catalytic subunit of yeast DNA polymerase alpha in three states (apo, bound to RNA-primed DNA, and a complete catalytic complex). The polymerase is shown to bind to an RNA/DNA helix containing a turn of A-form base pairs in the duplex upstream of the active site. Biochemical and computational results are presented that lead the authors to suggest a mechanism for the termination of primer synthesis by polymerase alpha after one helical turn, allowing transfer of the primer-template to the DNA polymerases that perform most of nuclear DNA replication. The enzyme binds selectively to the A-form helix embodied by the RNA-DNA substrate. Primer extension with deoxynucletides is expected to change the conformation of the primer-template towards a B-form helix, which would not be optimal for the observed contacts seen with the A-form primer-template in the crystal structure. Release of Pol \u03b1 enables Pol \u03b4 to proceed to complete the faithful synthesis of Okazaki fragments."

The crystallographic data presented are impressive and are technically sound, and the structures are novel. The observations presented here are consistent with the authors' hypothesis about DNA release from Pol \u03b1, which is logical and elegant in its simplicity. This manuscript elucidates a fundamental mechanism of eukaryotic replication and will therefore be of general interest to a large group of biologists.

Indeed, the crystallisation experiment with the shorter RNA primer was successful and we were able to solve the structure of the active complex, albeit at the lower resolution of 3.6 \u00c5 (Perera and Pellegrini, unpublished data).

The superposition shows that the geometry of Pol \u03b1's active site is very closely related to that of Pol \u03b4; therefore, we believe that nucleotide polymerization by Pol \u03b1 proceeds via the same two-metal ion catalysis demonstrated previously for other DNA polymerases.
