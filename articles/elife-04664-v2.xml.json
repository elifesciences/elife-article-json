This activation normally occurs just before the gene that produces Nodal is turned on. If the <i>hbox12</i> gene function is impaired, the Nodal protein is produced in both the front and the back sections of the embryo.

As opposite, only fuzzy clues are known as to the early steps that trigger the DV gene regulatory network. According to the current models, at the early blastula stage a maternally related anisotropy in redox gradient would transiently inactivate the p38 kinase in the future dorsal ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bradham and McClay, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Coffman, 2009</a>), somehow leading to activation of the maternal bZIP and Oct1/2 factors on the ventral side (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nam et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Range et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Range and Lepage, 2011</a>). The <i>cis</i>-regulatory apparatus of <i>nodal</i> responds to these factors, as well as to the maternal positive inputs of SoxB1 and Univin (<a href=\"#bib53\">Range et al., 2007</a>), directing the expression of the gene within a discrete sector of the ectoderm that corresponds to the presumptive oral ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib32\">Duboc et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Flowers et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Saudemont et al., 2010</a>).

In strict accordance with this possibility, it has been shown that the transcription repressor FoxQ2 contributes, together with Lefty, to suppress <i>nodal</i> expression in the apical neurogenic ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yaguchi et al., 2008</a>). On the other hand, a similar negative function acting on <i>nodal</i> within the presumptive dorsal ectoderm cells has not yet been uncovered. An extremely interesting candidate for this role is the zygotically-expressed <i>hbox12</i> homeobox-containing gene. In <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i>, <i>hbox12</i> expression precedes the onset of <i>nodal</i> transcription, then declines after the 60-cell stage and is no longer detectable by hatching (<a href=\"#bib28\">Di Bernardo et al., 1995</a>; this paper). Intriguingly, <i>hbox12</i> transcripts are asymmetrically distributed along the DV axis, being confined in cells that become aboral ectoderm, as revealed by <i>cis</i>-regulatory analysis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cavalieri et al., 2008</a>). The observed pattern of expression is so far unique in sea urchin development, and suggests that the Hbox12 transcription factor could act as a precocious input within the gene regulatory network that directs DV patterning. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have previously shown that disrupting the function of the Otx activator, a driver of <i>hbox12</i>, downregulates <i>hbox12</i> transcription and dramatically affects embryo polarization along the DV axis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cavalieri et al., 2008</a>). Here we extend these findings providing more direct evidence indicating that <i>hbox12</i> is a key upstream gene in the symmetry-breaking sequence of events, functioning to prevent the ectopic activation of <i>nodal</i> transcription within the prospective dorsal side of the early sea urchin embryo."

This is further supported by directly comparing the dynamic temporal and spatial patterns of <i>hbox12</i> and <i>nodal</i> transcription during very early development. As expected, <i>hbox12</i> expression begins at least two cell divisions earlier with respect to that of <i>nodal</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Double-labeling whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) at the early blastula stage showed that the spatial domains of expression of the two genes occupy opposite sectors of the embryo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These results, coupled with those of the <i>cis</i>-regulatory analysis reported previously (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cavalieri et al., 2008</a>), lead us to definitively conclude that <i>hbox12</i> is expressed in the prospective dorsal ectoderm of the early embryo.

Indeed, microinjection of equal amounts of either <i>hbox12</i> or <i>hd-En</i> mRNA caused a dose-dependent attenuation in the level of <i>nodal</i> transcript at a very similar extent, as revealed by qPCR analysis from <i>hbox12</i>-injected embryos at morula stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Expression of the additional oral ectoderm marker <i>goosecoid</i> (<i>gsc</i>) as well as the aboral ectoderm marker <i>tbx2/3</i> was also reduced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), as expected from the perturbed expression of <i>nodal</i> normally necessary for the establishment of the entire DV axis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Duboc et al., 2004</a>). The variations in transcript abundance shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a> could appear somewhat modest, although they are of the same order of magnitude as those reported by other authors (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agca et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bergeron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Coffman et al., 2004</a>). A possible explanation is that the qPCR data refer to the whole embryo population, affected and not affected. In fact, in our experiments only about half of the <i>hbox12</i>-injected embryos developed as aberrant larvae that, unfortunately, could not be isolated at early stages because they were virtually indistinguishable from the unaffected ones. In addition, the phenotype exhibited by the affected embryos was broadly similar but not perfectly identical to that obtained following knock down of <i>nodal</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Duboc et al., 2004</a>), leading us to speculate that <i>nodal</i> expression was decreased to some extent in the overtly affected embryos. In close agreement with this hypothesis, WMISH showed that the expression of <i>nodal</i>, <i>gsc</i>, and <i>tbx2/3</i> genes was apparently reduced (n = 36/93; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013G</a>) or even nullified (n = 8/93; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2I\u2013K</a>) in roughly 47% (n = 93) of <i>hbox12</i>-injected embryos. Although we were not able to quantify subtle differences, if any, in gene expression between control- and <i>hbox12</i>-injected embryos by a mere analysis of Dig-probe staining, the overall fraction of embryos showing defective expression of <i>nodal</i>, <i>gsc</i>, and <i>tbx2/3</i> was somewhat consistent with that of embryos that ultimately displayed unambiguous loss of DV polarization at later stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). These findings substantially override the lack of significance in of qPCR expression data, that although showed less than threefold difference, are strengthened by the WMISH results. Altogether, our findings indicate that ectopic expression of <i>hbox12</i> disrupted the patterning of the ectodermal domains along the DV axis."

In addition, these findings indicate that skeletogenic disorders originate not in PMCs, but are due to a failure in the overlying ectoderm to provide adequate patterning information."

Old and new intriguing experiments suggest that a respiratory gradient in the early sea urchin embryo could bias DV axis orientation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pease, 1941</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Child, 1948</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Czihak, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Coffman and Davidson, 2001</a>). As an additional clue, the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase has higher activity in the presumptive ventral side of the early embryo (<a href=\"#bib25\">Czihak, 1963</a>), probably due to a local enrichment in mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib24\">Coffman et al., 2004</a>). A possible link between the redox gradient and the initiation of <i>nodal</i> transcription is represented by the stress activated kinase p38, which is responsive to reactive-oxygen-species in the sea urchin embryo (<a href=\"#bib22\">Coffman et al., 2009</a>) and is required for <i>nodal</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bradham and McClay, 2006</a>). In agreement with this hypothesis, we show that Hbox12 is functionally upstream of p38. This conclusion is firstly supported by the fact that impairing Hbox12 function, by injection of the <i>hd</i> RNA, efficiently supplanted the anisotropic inactivation of a GFP-tagged p38 in the prospective dorsal side of the 60-cell stage embryo. By contrast, and in accordance with the previous result, either the ectopic or clonal expression of the <i>hbox12</i> mRNA specifically prevents p38-GFP nuclear translocation.

The mechanism by which Hbox12 suppresses p38 function remains an open question. As the functional status of p38 depends upon the balance between specific kinase and phosphatase activities, Hbox12 might switch such a balance in dorsal cells. For instance, this could be accomplished by suppressing locally the expression of the kinase involved in p38 activation. In a distinct scenario, Hbox12 might work in a regulatory tandem together with a downstream repressor, constituting a so-called double-negative gate which in turn would allow the dorsal-restricted expression of the phosphatase acting on p38. Such an exclusion effect is not uncommon, especially during early embryogenesis, and numerous examples have been described across metazoans (<a href=\"#bib51\">Oliveri and Davidson, 2007</a>). Another fascinating possibility will require learning whether p38 directly interacts with the Hbox12 regulator as it does with other homeodomain-containing transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib38\">Houde et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). Whatever is the mechanism, our results shed new light on the understanding of symmetry breaking events acting upstream of Nodal signaling for the establishment of the DV organizer activity during early embryogenesis of the sea urchin. This makes <i>hbox12</i> the earliest regulatory gene integrated in the molecular circuit that initiate DV axis formation in the embryo. The identification and characterization of potential asymmetric input drivers involved in the control of <i>hbox12</i> transcription might further improve our understanding of the nature of DV polarization. On this basis, an intriguing issue to be elucidated would be to know whether maternal redox information somehow integrates at the level of the <i>cis</i>-regulatory apparatus of the <i>hbox12</i> gene. Experiments are currently underway to explore this possibility."

Classical studies in <i>P. lividus</i> embryos instead demonstrate that DV axis is randomly oriented with respect to the first cleavage plane, and that it is established between the fifth and eighth cleavage stage (<a href=\"#bib37\">Horstadius and Wolsky, 1936</a>), which broadly corresponds to the peak of <i>hbox12</i> expression."

This manuscript presents generally compelling experimental evidence that the sea urchin Hbox12 gene encodes a transcriptional repressor whose early expression in the dorsal animal domain of the embryo is required for the proper dorsal-ventral patterning of the embryo by restricting Nodal to the ventral domain. The work contributes to our understanding of early symmetry breaking events in embryonic development and because Nodal has an important role in patterning of other deuterostome embryos this study should be of interest to the broader research community. However there are several important points which need to be addressed in a revised version of the paper before making a final decision on acceptance for publication."

Conventional loss of function experiments are not provided data, presumably because there are multiple genes. The RNA overexpression only partly overcomes this problem and the overexpression phenotype is not fully described. For instance, there is a description in the text, and a figure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), but the only substantiation of changes in tissue distribution is a low quality in situ RNA hybridization for a mesenchyme gene. If the contention is that there is a change in the distribution of ectodermal domains, this really should be substantiated with tissue specific gene or antibody localizations with specific markers."
