VZV reactivation is subject to the opposing mechanisms of declining and boosted VZV-specific cellular mediated immunity (CMI). A reduction in exogenous re-exposure \u2018opportunities\u2019 through universal chickenpox vaccination could therefore lead to an increase in HZ incidence. We present the first individual-based model that integrates within-host data on VZV-CMI and between-host transmission data to simulate HZ incidence. This model allows estimating currently unknown pivotal biomedical parameters, including the duration of exogenous boosting at 2 years, with a peak threefold to fourfold increase of VZV-CMI; the VZV weekly reactivation probability at 5% and VZV subclinical reactivation having no effect on VZV-CMI. A 100% effective chickenpox vaccine given to 1 year olds would cause a 1.75 times peak increase in HZ 31 years after implementation. This increase is predicted to occur mainly in younger age groups than is currently assumed."

VZV reactivation is subject to the opposing mechanisms of declining and boosted VZV-specific cellular mediated immunity (CMI). A reduction in exogenous re-exposure \u2018opportunities\u2019 through universal chickenpox vaccination could therefore lead to an increase in HZ incidence. We present the first individual-based model that integrates within-host data on VZV-CMI and between-host transmission data to simulate HZ incidence. This model allows estimating currently unknown pivotal biomedical parameters, including the duration of exogenous boosting at 2 years, with a peak threefold to fourfold increase of VZV-CMI; the VZV weekly reactivation probability at 5% and VZV subclinical reactivation having no effect on VZV-CMI. A 100% effective chickenpox vaccine given to 1 year olds would cause a 1.75 times peak increase in HZ 31 years after implementation. This increase is predicted to occur mainly in younger age groups than is currently assumed."

But some countries have hesitated. One reason for this hesitation is that exposure to individuals with a chickenpox infection helps boost the immunity of individuals who have previously been infected. This may help reduce the likelihood of these people developing shingles later in life. So, some countries have worried that chickenpox vaccinations might inadvertently increase the number of shingles cases. To assess this risk, many scientists have created computer models, but the models have some limitations."

The model suggests that re-exposure to the varicella virus through contact with infected people would only provide extra protection for about two years; this is much shorter than previous predictions that suggested it might last 20 years. The model also predicts that implementing a varicella vaccination program for children would almost double the number of shingles cases 31 years later. But this increase would be temporary."

This is unexpected because most previous models predict that older age groups would bear the brunt of a rise in shingles, but this younger population would be less likely to develop lasting complications of shingles. Together, these findings may allay some fears about implementing childhood varicella vaccination programs by showing that the benefits of re-exposure are limited."

Latency can then be interrupted by episodes of (primarily subclinical) reactivation of VZV as shown by the detection of VZV in saliva or blood from otherwise healthy individuals (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sch\u00fcnemann et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Nagel et al., 2011</a>). VZV reactivations may also cause herpes zoster (HZ), which presents clinically as a painful dermatomal rash. HZ occurs most frequently in individuals with a drastically declined cellular immune status (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dolin et al., 1978</a>), but ageing itself is often assumed to substantially reduce resilience of the VZV-specific immune response (<a href=\"#bib23\">Miller, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berger et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Levin et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>). Recent research supports the hypothesis that waning of VZV cellular mediated immunity (CMI) by age is also influenced by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ogunjimi et al., 2014</a>)."

However, in many other countries policy makers have been hesitant to introduce childhood VZV vaccination due to the general population's perception of varicella as a relatively mild disease, as well as the so-called exogenous boosting hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hope-Simpson, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ogunjimi et al., 2013</a>). This hypothesis is based on the concept of the secondary immune response and assumes that boosting of VZV-CMI occurs upon re-exposure to varicella. Boosted VZV-specific cellular immunity would subsequently reduce the risk of VZV reactivation and thence HZ. The introduction of widespread childhood VZV vaccination would reduce opportunities for varicella re-exposure and could therefore increase HZ incidence, as shown in model-based projections (<a href=\"#bib32\">Schuette and Hethcote, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brisson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bilcke et al., 2013</a>). Although current data on HZ-incidence post introduction of childhood VZV vaccination has caused controversy, a systematic review rating the quality of the evidence, concluded that exogenous boosting exists, but that its population-wide effect after widespread childhood VZV vaccination remains highly uncertain (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ogunjimi et al., 2013</a>). One of the main points of criticism on current predictions by deterministic VZV simulation models is the entanglement of exogenous boosting, waning of immunity, immunosenescence and reactivation undermining the possibility of estimating the magnitude and duration of exogenous boosting accurately. A concern is that these entangled parameters can be chosen to fit these models well to observed HZ incidence data, but that they are too artificial to allow real and verifiable biological interpretations. This leads to currently unverifiable and potentially poor predictions of VZV dynamics beyond the fitted equilibrium states. An additional, hitherto ignored uncertainty, is the potential occurrence of endogenous boosting by subclinical VZV reactivation. Indeed, some studies have shown VZV to reactivate subclinically both in healthy individuals, immunocompromised and stressed individuals (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sch\u00fcnemann et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mehta et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Nagel et al., 2011</a>). However, the effect on VZV-CMI has not yet been quantified."

All best-fitting parameter sets were based on boosting scenario 3 (predefined exponential loss of boosted VZV-CMI). Seven of these models include exogenous boosting (defined as an exponential decay) with a peak value of 1.3, a boosting duration ranging between 2 and 15 years, no endogenous boosting, a weekly VZV reactivation probability and an annual VZV-CMI loss (= waning) estimated to be 1\u20131.5% and 1\u20132%, respectively. We note that although the fits are excellent for the most relevant age groups, 25 years and older, they are less suited to predict HZ incidence for younger ages. One model predicted a peak boosting value of 2.5, a boosting duration of only 1 year and no endogenous boosting. Although this model was less suited to fit to HZ data for older age groups, it fitted much better to HZ data for younger age groups. In additional analyses relaxing on some parameter constraints, we obtained final parameter sets that led to excellent predictions across all age groups (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The two best fitting parameter sets predicted peak boosting values between 2.8 and 4 (maximum allowable value), a duration of boosting limited to 1 or 2 years and, as before, no endogenous boosting.

Our predictions (averaged per parameter set) showed a net increase in HZ incidence during approximately 50 years (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The peak increase in HZ incidence was reached approximately 31 years after programme initiation and was 1.75 (1.64\u20131.87) (100% CI) times higher than the HZ incidence prior to varicella vaccination. The CI is constructed by using three runs per parameter set and normalizing each run by means of the run-specific averaged equilibrium HZ incidence between 100 and 300 years since the beginning of the simulation. This means that per 1,000,000 person-years the total number of HZ cases would increase on average from 3219 to 5313 (set 9) or from 3209 to 5955 (set 13). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> shows that the relative contribution of different age groups to HZ incidence changes in the time period after introduction of varicella vaccination.

This natural consequence of the secondary immune response will reduce an individual's risk for HZ. When the probability of contact per unit-time between currently infectious and previously recovered varicella patients reduces, through a reduction in varicella incidence, it can be expected that HZ incidence temporarily increases due to a lack of exogenous boosting (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hope-Simpson, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ogunjimi et al., 2013</a>)."

This model allowed us to combine immunological and virological data to estimate key parameters in VZV population dynamics, such as the peak CMI response following re-exposure, duration of boosting and VZV subclinical reactivation characteristics. This means that in contrast to the deterministic models where abstract and ad hoc compartments are created to define the transition between different epidemiological states (for example the transition of a varicella recovered state to a zoster susceptible state), we can actually work with true biological, and verifiable, concepts such as VZV-CMI. Our best fitting parameter sets for Belgium suggest the effective duration of exogenous boosting to last only between 1 and 2 years. These predictions are significantly lower than those from the highly cited deterministic VZV model by Brisson et al., in which the average duration was predicted to be 20 years ([7\u201341 years] 95%CI) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brisson et al., 2002</a>). Our peak immunological response was estimated to be 2.8\u20134.0 times larger than the pre-re-exposure value. These predictions are consistent with those experimentally found in adults re-exposed to VZV by varicella contacts in the household (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arvin et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Vossen et al., 2004</a>) or by vaccination (<a href=\"#bib18\">Levin et al., 2008</a>). A possible limitation of our study was that all close contacts with varicella patients were assumed to exert an equal \u2018average\u2019 boosting effect on the exposed individual.

The observed weekly VZV reactivation probability is a topic of discussion in the literature and varies between 0 and 71%. As such it is difficult to compare our estimates with the range of observed values. We also note that VZV reactivation in our model might only be detectable at the neural ganglia at not (always) necessarily in peripheral tissues. In order for HZ to occur, we assumed that VZV-CMI should be below a relative threshold (following a specific distribution) during VZV reactivation. None of our best fitting parameter sets predicted a significant effect of VZV reactivation on VZV-CMI, implying that endogenous boosting most likely does not have an impact on the occurrence of HZ. This finding is important since the existence of endogenous boosting has been proposed to have an effect in reducing the negative effects of varicella vaccination on HZ incidence. Future experimental studies should focus on confirming our predicted VZV reactivation probability and the lack of endogenous boosting."

This result is lower than the 2.7\u20133.9% experimentally observed by Levin et al. for individuals older than 60 years (<a href=\"#bib18\">Levin et al., 2008</a>). The twofold difference in waning rate can be explained by the explicit disentanglement of waning and boosting (with younger age groups having\u2014on average\u2014higher probabilities of being boosted recently thereby actually increasing the observed waning rate). A limitation in our study is the use of a fixed waning rate for all ages. Our results might be interpreted as an averaged result of lower waning rates for younger age groups and higher waning rates for older age groups (as documented by <a href=\"#bib18\">Levin et al. (2008)</a>). A higher waning rate in older age groups could for example be caused by chronic CMV infection (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ogunjimi et al., 2014</a>). Although different types of waning (both in model specification and age dependency) can be used in this kind of simulation models, we believe that further experimental data documenting VZV specific cellular memory as a function of age is needed so that new waning models can be appropriately formulated. One future avenue of research could be the fitting of our predicted VZV-CMI to observed VZV-CMI data, as this will be a mixture of waning, immunosenescence and boosting. Better VZV-CMI datasets than those currently available are needed to be able to do this. These datasets could and should contain immune responses against different VZV peptides and could differentiate between the different cellular immunity compartments (CD4 vs CD8 and central vs effector memory cells). The use of our VZV IBM could help us identify which VZV-CMI compartment is of importance in controlling HZ."

We predicted a net increase in HZ incidence during 50 years and a 1.75 peak fold increase 31 years after introduction of the vaccination program. This delay in the HZ peak incidence is caused by cohorts born close to the time varicella vaccination was introduced experiencing less repeated boosting instances during their childhood than previously born cohorts (a mechanism that is similar to the progressive immunity model proposed in the deterministic VZV model by <a href=\"#bib13\">Guzzetta et al. (2013)</a>). Although increases in HZ incidences following universal childhood varicella vaccination have been noticed, some authors have attributed these increases to a background evolution that was already present prior to CP vaccination (see discussion in <a href=\"#bib26\">Ogunjimi et al. (2013)</a>). However, our analysis shows that proper documentation of significant increases in HZ incidence might not be possible during the first 10 years, even if a 100% effective vaccine would be used. For instance, during the first 10 years of the US program, both uptake and efficacy with the initial single dose vaccination programme were far below 100%. Although our model predicts a much lower duration of boosting than used hitherto in compartmental models (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ogunjimi et al., 2013</a>), some of our overall HZ projections are qualitatively similar. However, in contrast to earlier model estimates our VZV IBM predicts that 31\u201340 year olds contribute the most to the peak in HZ incidence following varicella vaccination. Some observational studies found no effect of varicella vaccination on HZ incidence for those aged 60 years and older (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hales et al., 2013</a>). This could be compatible with an overall HZ incidence increase due to rising HZ incidence among 31\u201340 year olds. Importantly, younger adults have been shown to be less likely to develop post-herpetic neuralgia (<a href=\"#bib30\">Opstelten et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Drolet et al., 2010</a>). Thus although our aggregated predictions regarding the increase in HZ incidence following varicella vaccination may appear similar to those published using deterministic models, cost-effectiveness analyses using our VZV IBM would be more in favor of universal childhood varicella vaccination."

For example, if a new experimental study would prove the existence of endogenous boosting, this could be readily implemented in our VZV IBM so that parameter sets could be estimated, conditional on the existence of endogenous boosting. Although our IBM has given us valuable insights into between-host and within-host VZV dynamics, other influential factors could be introduced in future versions. These factors could relate to CMV-immunosenescence (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ogunjimi et al., 2014</a>), maternal antibodies, reduced VZV-CMI induction if infected during the first year of life as this might improve the prediction of the teenage group (<a href=\"#bib34\">Terada et al., 1994</a>), co-infection with other viruses (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ogunjimi et al., 2015</a>), risk groups (for e.g., immunosuppressed individuals) and HLA types (<a href=\"#bib22\">Meysman et al., 2015</a>). Although current deterministic compartmental models should be able to partially account for these effects, a VZV IBM seems better suited to directly model the influence of these immunity-perturbing factors. Future VZV IBM should also explore more realistic vaccination scenarios as well as inter-country variability (<a href=\"#bib31\">Poletti et al., 2013</a>)."

In contrast to classical deterministic epidemiological models, our model is not explicitly compartmentalized by means of ad hoc defined epidemiological groups. Instead the main \u2018flow diagram\u2019 represents the evolution of VZV-CMI with time and under several events (for more details see the next paragraphs). Briefly, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> illustrates that individuals are born susceptible and that VZV-CMI is equal to zero during this time period. After exposure to chickenpox or HZ, VZV-CMI receives an initial value. Next, VZV-CMI is expected to undergo waning and several events can occur. The first event depicted (but the reader should realize that the timing of the events are interchangeable) is exogenous boosting after re-exposure to either chickenpox or HZ. Exogenous boosting is assumed to increase VZV-CMI temporary, after which decay towards \u2018the original trajectory of VZV-CMI\u2019 is assumed to occur. Next, we depicted unsuccessful reactivation of VZV that is assumed to cause endogenous boosting of VZV-CMI (again followed by a decay). However, if the FoR is relatively higher than VZV-CMI, VZV reactivation will be successful and will cause HZ (followed by a reinstatement of VZV-CMI)."

The reader should imagine the FoR to represent independent reactivation behavior of VZV and whether this reactivation will lead to HZ or endogenous boosting will depend on the value of VZV-CMI. The FoR deviates per time step and individual by means of a gamma probability density function. This gamma function is chosen as it represents the summation of unknown biological phenomena that are assumed to have an exponential distribution. The parameter set includes four different gamma distributions (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). HZ individuals are assumed to be infectious for 1 week and receive a VZV-CMI reset to 1 \u00b1 random factor (normally distributed, cf. primary infection). There exists no data on the relative infectiousness of HZ patients nor is it likely that this can be estimated through experiments. We chose to approximate the relative infectiousness of HZ patients by the relative infectiousness of breakthrough CP patients (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernstein et al., 1993</a>). This has previously been estimated at 0.17 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brisson et al., 2002</a>). Although HZ infectiousness was needed to maintain circulation of VZV in our model, the relative effects on overall VZV transmission are\u2014compared to CP\u2014marginal. <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> shows the results of a sensitivity analysis in which we varied HZ infectiousness from 0.03 to 0.45 for the 13 best fitting parameter. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> our results are quite robust. Reinstallation of VZV-specific immunity after HZ is based on experimental data showing that a second case of HZ only occurs in about 5% of individuals (<a href=\"#bib40\">Yawn et al., 2011</a>) and that VZV-CMI is higher in recovered HZ patients than in age-matched controls (<a href=\"#bib37\">Weinberg et al., 2009</a>)."

Simulations ran for 320 years and model output was obtained by averaging the age-specific results over the last 80 years. The main outputs were CP incidence, HZ incidence, VZV serology and VZV-CMI. In order to optimize the fitting procedure, we performed a two-step parameter set analysis. The following 7 parameters were estimated by means of the fitting procedure: VZV-CMI waning rate, type of boosting scenario, duration of exogenous boosting, peak fold increase following exogenous boosting, VZV reactivation probability, FoR distribution and the peak fold increase following endogenous boosting."

Natural deaths are selected based on the age-dependent mortality rate. Per time step, the number of newborns equals the number of deaths to obtain a constant population size. To conduct predictions over many years, a stationary demographic structure is required throughout the simulated period. The Belgian population from 2012 has an overrepresentation of people from age 40 to 60 years (see Figure 7). Applying a fixed age-dependent mortality rate in combination with the replacement by newborns would results in an oscillating population distribution over time with respect to age. Therefore, the initial age distribution is not based on the Belgian population count from 2012 but on the survivor function estimated from data on the number of deaths per capita.
