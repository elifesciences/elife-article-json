                    "text": "During infection chlamydial pathogens form an intracellular membrane-bound replicative niche termed the inclusion, which is enriched with bacterial transmembrane proteins called Incs. Incs bind and manipulate host cell proteins to promote inclusion expansion and provide camouflage against innate immune responses. Sorting nexin (SNX) proteins that normally function in endosomal membrane trafficking are a major class of inclusion-associated host proteins, and are recruited by IncE/CT116. Crystal structures of the SNX5 phox-homology (PX) domain in complex with IncE define the precise molecular basis for these interactions. The binding site is unique to SNX5 and related family members SNX6 and SNX32. Intriguingly the site is also conserved in SNX5 homologues throughout evolution, suggesting that IncE captures SNX5-related proteins by mimicking a native host protein interaction. These findings thus provide the first mechanistic insights both into how chlamydial Incs hijack host proteins, and how SNX5-related PX domains function as scaffolds in protein complex assembly."

Incs bind and manipulate host cell proteins to promote inclusion expansion and provide camouflage against innate immune responses. Sorting nexin (SNX) proteins that normally function in endosomal membrane trafficking are a major class of inclusion-associated host proteins, and are recruited by IncE/CT116. Crystal structures of the SNX5 phox-homology (PX) domain in complex with IncE define the precise molecular basis for these interactions. The binding site is unique to SNX5 and related family members SNX6 and SNX32. Intriguingly the site is also conserved in SNX5 homologues throughout evolution, suggesting that IncE captures SNX5-related proteins by mimicking a native host protein interaction. These findings thus provide the first mechanistic insights both into how chlamydial Incs hijack host proteins, and how SNX5-related PX domains function as scaffolds in protein complex assembly."

The bacteria must directly enter the cells of its human host to grow and multiply. Inside a human cell, the bacteria form and then develop within specialized compartments called inclusions that are surrounded by membrane. The outside of the inclusion membrane becomes coated with dozens of unique bacterial proteins. The major role of these bacterial proteins is to hijack other proteins in the human cell to generate and maintain the membrane of the inclusion compartments."

The structure shows that the part of SNX5 that associates with IncE is the part of the protein normally thought to interact with specific fatty molecules rather than proteins. Further experiments showed that SNX5 was still recruited to the inclusion compartment when the amount of these fatty molecules in human cells was reduced. However, this was not the case if SNX5 was prevented from interaction with the IncE protein."

The findings also show how studying bacteria that live within host cells, like chlamydia, can provide insight into how other molecules are normally transported within cells: a process that is fundamental to all living cells."

Many pathogens manipulate endocytic pathways to gain entry into host cells and generate a membrane-enclosed replicative niche. This frequently involves hijacking or inhibiting the host cell trafficking machinery, first to generate the pathogen containing vacuole (PCV) and subsequently to prevent fusion with lysosomal degradative compartments. Concomitantly the pathogen often endeavors to decorate the PCV with host proteins and lipids that mimic other host cell organelles in order to circumvent innate immune detection, expand the replicative niche and acquire nutrients to support intracellular replication (<a href=\"#bib15\">Di Russo Case and Samuel, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Personnic et al., 2016</a>).

Both reports confirmed that membrane trafficking proteins are major components of the inclusion proteome; and in particular members of the endosomal sorting nexin (SNX) family are highly enriched. Specifically it was shown that the <i>C. trachomatis</i> IncE/CT116 protein could recruit SNX proteins containing bin-amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domains SNX1, SNX2, SNX5 and SNX6 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). SNX1 and SNX2 are highly homologous and form heterodimeric assemblies with either SNX5 or SNX6 to promote endosomal membrane tubulation and trafficking (<a href=\"#bib54\">van Weering et al., 2012</a>). A fifth protein SNX32 is highly similar to SNX5 and SNX6 but is almost exclusively expressed in the brain and has not yet been characterized. SNX recruitment to the inclusion occurs via the C-terminal region of IncE interacting with the phox-homology (PX) domains of SNX5 or SNX6 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Interestingly, RNAi-mediated depletion of SNX5/SNX6 does not slow infection but rather increases the production of infectious <i>C. trachomatis</i> progeny suggesting that the SNX recruitment is not done to enable bacterial infection. Instead it was proposed that because SNX proteins regulate endocytic and lysosomal degradation, the manipulation by IncE could be an attempt to circumvent SNX-enhanced bacterial destruction (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aeberhard et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>)."

When bound to SNX5, IncE adopts an elongated \u03b2-hairpin structure, with key hydrophobic residues docked into a complementary binding groove encompassing a helix-turn-helix structural extension that is unique to SNX5, SNX6, and the brain-specific homologue SNX32. A striking degree of evolutionary conservation in the IncE-binding groove suggests that IncE co-opts the SNX5-related molecules by displacing a host protein (as yet unidentified) that normally binds to this site. Our work thus provides both the first mechanistic insights into how protein hijacking is mediated by inclusion membrane proteins, and also sheds light on the functional role of the SNX5-related PX domains as scaffolds for protein complex assembly."

We first confirmed this for myc-tagged SNX1, SNX2 and SNX5 in HeLa cells infected with <i>C. trachomatis</i> serovar L2 (MOI\u00a0~0.5) for 18 hr. All three proteins were recruited to the inclusion membrane as assessed by co-localisation with the inclusion marker mCherry-Rab25 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Teo et al., 2016</a>), as were GFP-tagged SNX1 and SNX5 but not the more distantly homologous GFP-SNX8 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also observed localization of the SNX proteins to extensive inclusion-associated membrane tubules in a subset of infected cells as described previously (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aeberhard et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, when infected cells are treated with wortmannin, a pan-specific inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) activity, we see a loss of the SNX proteins from punctate endosomes, but not from the inclusion membrane (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). A similar result is seen for specific inhibition of PtdIns3<i>P</i> production by Vps34 using Vps34-IN1 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This offers two possibilities; that either SNX recruitment to the inclusion occurs via protein-protein interactions, and does not depend on the presence of 3-phosphoinositide lipids that typically recruit SNX proteins to endosomal membranes, or alternatively that PI3Ks are not present at the inclusion and therefore wortmannin treatment has no effect at this particular compartment. Given our structural and mutagenesis studies below we favor the former explanation."

To confirm their direct association we assessed the binding affinities using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Initial experiments with the human SNX5 and SNX6 PX domains showed robust interactions with the IncE C-terminal domain (residues 107\u2013132). The affinities (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) for SNX5 and SNX6 were essentially indistinguishable (0.9 and 1.1 \u00b5M respectively), but we detected no interaction with the PX domain of SNX1 confirming the binding specificity. The PX domains of SNX5 and SNX6 possess a helix-turn-helix structural insert (<a href=\"#bib29\">Koharudin et al., 2009</a>), which is not found in any other SNX family members except for SNX32 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), a homologue expressed primarily in neurons (BioGPS (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wu et al., 2009</a>)). Confirming a common recruitment motif in the SNX5-related proteins, ITC showed a strong interaction between IncE and the SNX32 PX domain similar to SNX5 and SNX6 (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.0 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), and SNX32 was robustly recruited to inclusion membranes in infected cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Synthetic peptides were used with single amino acids removed sequentially from the N and C-terminus to determine the minimal sequence required for binding. These experiments showed that the shortest region of IncE able to support full binding to SNX5 encompasses residues 110\u2013131 (GPAVQFFKGKNGSADQVILVT), while a shorter fragment containing residues 113\u2013130 (VQFFKGKNGSADQVILV) can bind to SNX5 with a slightly reduced affinity. While variations are observed across the different <i>C. trachomatis</i> serovars (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harris et al., 2012</a>) the SNX5-binding sequence appears to be preserved in all detected variants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). A comparison with other chlamydial species suggests that IncE is not very widely conserved in this Genus, being clearly identifiable only in the closely related mouse pathogen <i>C. muridarum</i> and swine pathogen <i>C. suis</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Residues required for binding to SNX5 are preserved in these IncE homologues, but whether SNX proteins are also recruited during infection by these other chlamydial species remains to be determined."

At the N-terminus of the \u03b2A strand Val114 of IncE inserts into a pocket formed primarily by Tyr132 and Phe136 on the SNX5 \u03b1\u2019\u2019 helix (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). A major contribution comes from IncE Phe116, with \u03c0-stacking occurring with the Phe136 side-chain and hydrophobic docking with Val140 of SNX5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Adjacent to IncE Phe116 at the end of the \u03b2A strand Lys118 makes an electrostatic contact with SNX5 Glu144. Finally, at the C-terminal end of the IncE \u03b2B strand Val127 and Leu129 contact an extended SNX5 surface composed of Leu133, Tyr132 and Met106 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>)."

At the interface between SNX5 and IncE several side chains make key contributions to peptide recognition. Because Leu133 and Phe136 residues in SNX5 are located at the core of the IncE-binding interface, and also due to the structural rearrangements these residues make on binding (see below), we reasoned that L133D and F136A mutations would inhibit the interaction. Indeed these mutants abolished association with the IncE peptide (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The reciprocal mutations in IncE residues F116A and V127D also abolished binding to the SNX5 PX domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and the SNX6 and SNX32 PX domains (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), demonstrating the importance of these hydrophobic and \u03c0-stacking interactions for stable complex formation. In contrast mutations predicted to disrupt an observed electrostatic contact (IncE K118A or SNX5 E144A) had little effect on binding. Thus the core hydrophobic interactions are critical for IncE binding but the peripheral electrostatic contact is not essential."

Cells expressing the GFP-SNX5 protein showed clear and uniform recruitment to the limiting membrane of the inclusion as defined by mCherry-Rab25 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), which is consistent with the localisation observed by others (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aeberhard et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, the GFP-SNX5 (F136A) mutant protein showed no recruitment to the chlamydial inclusion. The change in relative distribution of these GFP-SNX5 proteins on the inclusion was quantified for wildtype SNX5 (Mander\u2019s coefficient 0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14) and GFP-SNX5 (F136A) (0.041\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.051) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Like wild-type GFP-SNX5 the GFP-SNX5 (F136A) mutant was recruited to punctate endosomal structures throughout the cytoplasm of these cells, and in addition was able to co-immunoprecipate endogenous SNX1 in heterodimeric complexes identically to the wild-type GFP-SNX5 protein (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This implies that BAR-domain mediated heterodimer formation with SNX1 or SNX2 is required for endosomal recruitment, and is not perturbed by the IncE-binding mutation in the PX domain. Lastly, we tested the importance of IncE residues for SNX interaction in situ by expressing the GFP-tagged IncE C-terminal domain. The wild-type GFP-IncE(91-132) was recruited to endosomal structures via its interaction with SNX5-related proteins in both uninfected and infected HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In contrast however, GFP-IncE(91-132)(F116D), a SNX5-binding mutant, was exclusively cytosolic. Note that neither IncE construct is localised to the inclusion, as expected due to lack of signal peptides and transmembrane domains (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

These residues are conserved in most PX domains including in SNX1 and SNX2, but are entirely absent in SNX5, SNX6 and SNX32. Although there is evidence for the weak association of the SNX5 PX domain with the lipid PtdIns(4,5)<i>P</i><sub>2</sub> from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments (<a href=\"#bib29\">Koharudin et al., 2009</a>), the crystal structure does not point to a clear binding mechanism. A second feature that sets SNX5-related proteins apart from the rest of the SNX family is the presence of an extended \u03b1-helical insertion. Our work confirms the central importance of this unique insert for the binding of the IncE inclusion protein, and provides the first clear description of how a PX domain can function as a protein-protein interaction scaffold as opposed to a lipid-binding domain."

Previously, the expression of a GFP-tagged IncE C-terminal domain was shown to interfere with the SNX5/SNX6-dependent retrograde trafficking of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). Combined with our structural data, this infers that IncE is mimicking and interfering with SNX5/SNX6-mediated protein interactions, with a ligand(s) required for normal endosomal trafficking that remains to be discovered. Once recruited to the inclusion, SNX-BAR proteins are localized to the bulk membrane and dynamic tubules. While it is logical to imagine they could play a positive role in the sculpting of the inclusion, this is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the effect of SNX5 and SNX6 knockdown, which results in an increased production of <i>C. trachomatis</i> infectious progeny. Alternatively, although a pool of SNX5/SNX6 and associated SNX1/SNX2 proteins remain on endosomes in <i>C. trachomatis</i> infected cells, their sequestering by the chlamydial inclusion may interfere with normal endosomal trafficking (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). It was thus proposed that the role of IncE could be to compete for SNX-retromer endosomal interactions, resulting in the breakdown of normal trafficking of the CI-MPR and lysosomal hydrolases and hence perturbation of the endolysosomal system\u2019s capacity for bacterial destruction (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aeberhard et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>).

Punctate structures were automatically counted using ImageJ analyse particle tool across total of 10 cells from two biological replicates. To quantify the effect of PI3K inhibitors on SNX recruitment (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), Z-stacks were captured with a Zeiss 710 confocal laser scanning microscope using a 40x objective. Maximum projections were generated with FIJI (<a href=\"https://fiji.sc/\">https://fiji.sc/</a>) and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients for individual cells determined using the FIJI \u2018Coloc 2\u2019 function with Costes threshold regression and 100 Costes randomisations. Co-localization analyses were conducted on two independent experiments from five images per condition each containing at least 20 cells (&gt;100 cells analysed per condition)."

The PX domain of the SNX5 model generated using this structural template was missing the extended \u03b1-helical insert, so to complete the model the SNX5 PX domain-IncE complex was substituted and a dimer of SNX5 and SNX1 PX-BAR domains generated by overlaying with the SNX9 dimer in the PtdIns3<i>P</i>-bound state (PDB ID 2RAK) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pylypenko et al., 2007</a>).

Engel and colleagues reported similar findings and more specifically, that the C-terminal portion of IncE binds to sorting nexins (SNXs) 5/6 of the retromer. Both reports showed that depletion of retromer components enhances progeny production, indicating that <i>Chlamydia</i> may hijack retromer to avoid degradative trafficking."

Comparable binding affinity is seen for SNX 5, 6 and 32 PX domains but not that of SNX1. The story is compact and of high quality; it is an interesting variation on a theme of Chlamydial hijacking and the reviewers support presentation in <i>eLife</i> because it highlights an interesting biological interaction of medical importance: the elucidation of the molecular basis for hijacking of endosomal SNX5/6 and possibly 32 by bacterial IncE is important and of interest to the readers of <i>eLife</i>. Overall, the data support the main conclusions of the paper, however a few aspects should be strengthened by a few straightforward, additional experiments."

The staining in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> is hard to see and quantitative image analysis from multiple experiments will greatly strengthen the present story. The presence of endogenous endosomal SNX proteins that may interfere with recruitment and result in additional effects (e.g. as they may heterodimerize) that make the results difficult to interpret. Thus it would be worth testing IncE-mediated recruitment of SNX5 to bacterial inclusions using quantitative image analysis in HeLa cells depleted of endogenous SNX5/6/32 that express wt or mutant versions of SNX5 to verify the conclusions from transient overexpression and qualitative imaging. Moreover, do the mutations in the IncE binding interface equally hamper recruitment of SNX6 and SNX32, similar to what is seen for SNX5? Are other endogenous SNX proteins co-recruited to the inclusion in this case?"

All they have done is adding some Mander's colocalization coefficient, but it is unclear from how many cells and how many independent experiments these are derived. More importantly, I would still like to see formal proof that the F136A mutation does not impair SNX5-SNX1 (or 2) heterodimer formation in vitro and its localization at endosomes in mammalian cells assayed quantitatively. This in my view is required to support the corresponding statement in the text. Also, some better high mag colocalization images illustrating SNX5 WT and mutant targeting to endosomes would help to convince readers of the paper."

Comparable binding affinity is seen for SNX 5, 6 and 32 PX domains but not that of SNX1. The story is compact and of high quality; it is an interesting variation on a theme of Chlamydial hijacking and the reviewers support presentation in eLife because it highlights an interesting biological interaction of medical importance: the elucidation of the molecular basis for hijacking of endosomal SNX5/6 and possibly 32 by bacterial IncE is important and of interest to the readers of eLife. Overall, the data support the main conclusions of the paper, however a few aspects should be strengthened by a few straightforward, additional experiments.</i>"

Firstly, the correlation of the IF signal for EEA1 and IncE is relatively low. They tend to be proximal to each other presumably as they are located on distinct subdomains of same endosomes (EEA1 \u2013 body; IncE/SNX5 \u2013 tubular domains). Secondly, the dramatic change of the mutant proteins to the cytoplasm results in a low level of correlation between endosome-associated proteins and the surrounding cytoplasm. We did calculate the number of punctate structures/per cell positive for GFP-IncE in an attempt to quantify any change in endosome association. For example, 29.556 +/- 4.558 punctate structures per cell were observed for IncE 91-132 while 0 +/- 0 for IncE 91-132 (F116D). However, as the analysis of the mutant proteins showed no punctate structures we felt documentation of this obvious difference provided little additional insight."

In addition, in unpublished results we recently determined a crystal structure of the SNX32 PX domain in complex with the peptide from IncE (see image showing an overlay of SNX32 and SNX5 complexes). In this case the structure was solved with a co-complex including a synthetic peptide rather than a fusion protein as done for SNX5 (resolution, 2.3 \u00c5; <i>R/R<sub>free</sub></i> 0.19/0.23). We have not included this data in the manuscript, but it clearly confirms for the referees that the binding site is essentially identical in both proteins.

We altered the text to emphasise wortmannin\u2019s broad inhibitory effect to avoid confusion: \u201cInterestingly, when infected cells are treated with wortmannin, a pan-specific inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) activity, we see a loss of the SNX proteins from punctate endosomes, but not from the inclusion membrane\u201d. The reviewers suggest that we perform additional experiments using a specific inhibitor such as the Class III PI3K inhibitor Vps34-IN1, which will block specific formation of PtdIns3P.
