Its essentiality may favor the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation (CGV) that has no effect in the wild-type but that enhances or suppresses the effects of rare disruptions to gene function. Here, we adapted a classical modifier screen to interrogate the alleles segregating in natural populations of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>: we induced gene knockdowns and used quantitative genetic methodology to examine how segregating variants modify the penetrance of embryonic lethality. Each perturbation revealed CGV, indicating that wild-type genomes harbor myriad genetic modifiers that may have little effect individually but which in aggregate can dramatically influence penetrance. Phenotypes were mediated by many modifiers, indicating high polygenicity, but the alleles tend to act very specifically, indicating low pleiotropy. Our findings demonstrate the extent of conditional functionality in complex trait architecture."

Its essentiality may favor the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation (CGV) that has no effect in the wild-type but that enhances or suppresses the effects of rare disruptions to gene function. Here, we adapted a classical modifier screen to interrogate the alleles segregating in natural populations of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>: we induced gene knockdowns and used quantitative genetic methodology to examine how segregating variants modify the penetrance of embryonic lethality. Each perturbation revealed CGV, indicating that wild-type genomes harbor myriad genetic modifiers that may have little effect individually but which in aggregate can dramatically influence penetrance. Phenotypes were mediated by many modifiers, indicating high polygenicity, but the alleles tend to act very specifically, indicating low pleiotropy. Our findings demonstrate the extent of conditional functionality in complex trait architecture."

Unlike mutations that are always silent with respect to phenotype, or mutations that always affect phenotype, CGV is invisible until a perturbation changes the molecular, cellular, or developmental processes that govern its phenotypic expression. In addition to genetic perturbations, CGV may be \u2018released\u2019 by environmental exposure, like the modern changes to diet that have been hypothesized to underlie the emergence of complex metabolic diseases in humans (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gibson, 2009</a>). The concept of CGV has been of longstanding interest to evolutionary theorists because it explains how populations might store alleles that enable adaptation when conditions change (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dobzhansky, 1941</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Waddington, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">McGuigan et al., 2011</a>), but its extent, architecture, and role in nature is largely unknown. Most of our empirical knowledge of CGV arises from studies that inhibited the heat shock chaperone protein HSP90 to reveal previously-silent mutational effects across many taxa, which probably represents a general mechanism that buffers genome-wide functional variation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Queitsch et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yeyati et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jarosz and Lindquist, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Wagner, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rohner et al., 2013</a>)."

These two classes of variation represent two general mechanisms of modifier action. Informational modifiers (such as suppressors of nonsense mutations in classical screens [e.g., <a href=\"#bib25\">Hodgkin et al., 1989</a>], and modifiers of germline RNAi sensitivity in this experiment) alter the effect of the initial perturbation in a non-gene-specific manner, while gene-specific modifiers reveal functional features of the targeted locus. By screening for modifiers of many different perturbations, we are able to quantitatively partition the effects of these mechanisms. Of the variation attributable to heritable modifier variation among worms, half is explained by non-gene-specific informational modifiers and half by gene-specific modifier effects (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

For example, despite high interaction within the <i>par</i> network, which underlies polarization of the zygote, the average pairwise <i>par</i> gene correlation was no higher than the average correlation across all genes (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Coefficients for <i>par-3</i> and <i>par-6</i> were correlated (correlation = 0.40, p = 0.003), but not for <i>par-3</i> and <i>pkc-3</i> (correlation = \u22120.17, p = 0.24) or <i>par-6</i> and <i>pkc-3</i> (correlation = 0.12, p = 0.41), even though their proteins together comprise the anterior polarity complex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Munro et al., 2004</a>). This indicates that the cryptic genetic modifiers have low developmental pleiotropy (<a href=\"#bib42\">Paaby and Rockman, 2013</a>). That is, variation at these loci must influence a very restricted suite of developmental events, since only specific perturbations uncover evidence of their phenotypic effects. For those associated with polarization of the zygote, this may be explained by the high degree of redundancy observed in the process (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beatty et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fievet et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Motegi and Seydoux, 2013</a>), as redundancy allows shared function of some factors and specificity of others. Exceptions to the overall trend of low correlation between gene perturbations are discussed below, in the context of genome-wide associations. The low pleiotropy of cryptic alleles may be a result of purifying selection, which over evolutionary time should deplete populations of pleiotropic alleles as they may be more likely to be deleterious (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stern, 2000</a>)."

In contrast, RNAi against 28 induced significant gene-specific variation in embryonic lethality among the five strains. Overall, both for genes with significant variation and for the whole set, lower expression of the target gene was usually correlated with less severe RNAi phenotypes (20 of 29 genes, p = 0.06), though the correlations are weak.

The haplotype, which spans approximately 10 kb, was also significantly associated with lethality phenotypes for <i>car-1</i>, <i>mom-5</i>, and <i>skn-1</i>; <i>skn-1</i> has a role in proteasome-mediated protein homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2011</a>).

Because the co-associations occur twice, with unlinked SNPs (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.26), they implicate the presence of at least two interacting cryptic alleles and provide independent lines of evidence for a relationship between <i>pkc-3</i> and <i>rfc-3</i>, genes with no reported interactions or shared functions."

In each of these cases, multiple RAD-sequenced strains collapse into groups of strains that are also identical at the 1454 SNPs, suggesting that this procedure is reliable. Only in the case of JU366 do we encounter uncertainty. At the 1454 SNP markers, this strain is identical to JU360, JU363, and JU368 (and three others not RAD-sequenced). JU360 and JU368 have identical RAD-seq haplotypes, but JU363 is different at 224 sites (of which 164 were tested for association with phenotype). We substituted both JU360 and JU363 as proxies for JU366 and ran the full GWAS pipeline twice; the differences in outcome were negligible, with extremely tight correlation among SNP p-values across all tests and no differences in the set of statistically significant SNPs."

Unfortunately, the myriad and complex ways in which gene-specific knockdown might vary across strains, including by mechanisms that are just beginning to be elucidated (e.g. transcriptional licensing), preclude us from easily distinguishing between different classes of CGV mechanism. The review points to one class of mechanism, variation in wild-type expression level, that we can explicitly test. A very recently published paper (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vu et al. 2015</a>) has shown that, across four strains with perturbations to genes involved in the electron transport chain, a strain with a more severe RNAi phenotype tends to have lower wild-type expression of the targeted gene. We acquired embryonic transcriptome data from the work of <a href=\"#bib23\">Grishkevich et al. (2012)</a> and tested for a correlation between gene expression level and our estimates of embryonic lethality. These results do not address whether variation in expression is, for example, via a trans effect that elevates overall pathway activity and compensates for knockdown of a particular member (i.e., the gene expression and RNAi phenotype share a common cause), or a cis- or trans-acting effect specific to the targeted gene, revealing pre-existing dosage variation that is tolerated under unperturbed conditions but causal of the RNAi phenotype under perturbation (cf. <a href=\"#bib39\">Milloz et al. 2008</a>). Nevertheless, this analysis adds a valuable component to our manuscript and a useful step forward in the larger exploration of the problem."
