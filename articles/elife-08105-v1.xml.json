Sequential reactivation of the hippocampal place cells along familiar paths while the animal pauses is well suited to such a memory retrieval process. It is, however, unknown whether this awake replay represents events occurring along the path. Using a subtask switching protocol in which the animal experienced three subtasks as \u2018what\u2019 information in a maze, I here show that the replay represents a trial type, consisting of path and subtask, in terms of neuronal firing timings and rates. The actual trial type to be rewarded could only be reliably predicted from replays that occurred at the decision point. This trial-type representation implies that not only \u2018where and when\u2019 but also \u2018what\u2019 information is contained in the replay. This result supports the view that awake replay is an episodic-like memory retrieval process."

Episodic memory retrieval is important not only for remembering recent events but also for imagining future ones (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hassabis et al., 2007</a>). The hippocampus is critically involved in episodic memory retrieval, and within this structure reside place cells\u2014principal cells exhibiting place-specific firing patterns in particular locations. The presence of such cells has led to the hypothesis that the hippocampus is the locus of the \u201cwhere\u201d element of episodic memory (<a href=\"#bib27\">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</a>). Following on from this seminal finding, more recent studies have demonstrated that hippocampal place cell activity simultaneously represents a broad range of aspects of memory, including odors and their match/non-match status in a particular location, called the \u201cplace field\u201d, as well as elapsed time (<a href=\"#bib30\">Otto and Eichenbaum, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sakurai, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wood et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pastalkova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">MacDonald et al., 2011</a>). In the place field, both firing rate and location can change independently and are affected by external factors, such as spatial environment and task demand, and internal factors such as prospective and retrospective memory (<a href=\"#bib25\">Markus et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Frank et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wood et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson and Jeffery, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferbinteanu and Shapiro, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Smith and Mizumori, 2006</a>). During maze running, place cell activity sequences in rodents convey information on both familiar paths and accompanying subtasks (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Takahashi, 2013</a>)."

During brief periods of immobility, pivotal paths to a remembered goal can be predicted, regardless of the location in which the SWRs have previously occurred (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>). Such \u201creplay\u201d is thus considered a neuronal substrate for retrieving memories on familiar paths (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carr et al., 2011</a>). However, previous studies investigating the content of replays have primarily focused on the geography and timeline of the animals' running path as experienced in the environment. It is therefore unclear whether the replay conveys information on events (i.e., \u201cwhat\u201d information) occurring along the reactivated path."

This task design allowed for comparison of hippocampal neuronal activity between and within different journeys and subtasks. I found that while the animal is running in the maze, differences between individual journeys and between subtasks in the maze are independently encoded in the firing locations and rates of place cells, respectively. Furthermore, all trial types (i.e., journey type and subtask) experienced in the maze could be decoded from the ensemble activity of place cells. Since the rats ran along similar spatial paths while performing different subtasks throughout this task, differences between subtasks can be interpreted as non-spatial \u201cwhat\u201d information. Provided that the mechanisms are preserved in temporally compressed replays that occur during brief periods of immobility, the subtask as \u201cwhat\u201d information occurring along the path in the maze might be examined in the replay. Building on this previous study (<a href=\"#bib36\">Takahashi, 2013</a>), I accordingly investigated whether \u201cwhat\u201d information is contained in the replay of place cell activity sequences during the brief immobility periods that occur while the animal is engaging in the task."

For each trial type, the rats' paths could be accurately decoded from the place cell activity sequences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, top) using a memoryless Bayesian decoder (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, middle; median error: 6.0\u201313.5 cm). Since similar paths could be decoded from the place cell activity sequences during trial types with the same journey but different subtasks (e.g., VD<sub>LR</sub>, NA<sub>LR</sub>, and DA<sub>LR</sub>), the Bayesian decoder cannot per se identify trial types. As my previous study reported (<a href=\"#bib36\">Takahashi, 2013</a>), differences between subtasks are encoded in firing rates across place cells. Therefore, using a prediction method based on these firing rates (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen et al., 2012</a>), I predicted trial type from the firing rate pattern across place cells in conjunction with the decoded path. The bottom portion of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows trial types predicted from rat I in a single trial. In the visually guided VD<sub>RR</sub> and VD<sub>LL</sub> trials, some mismatches occurred because the rats could not accurately predict the trial type until they reached the junction. The predictions were most accurate for the spatial alternation trials. Confusion matrices between predicted and actual trial types for each rat during the entire session (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) show that a similar pattern was observed for all rats (overall mean, 74.3\u201384.5% (leave-one-out estimate), chance = 12.5%; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The Bayesian decoder and the prediction method together are sufficient for interpreting the representation of path and trial type in place cell activity sequences."

Specifically, I assessed the directions in which the rats' heads were pointing at these times. In correct trials, the rats' heads pointed towards a goal in the opposite direction from the respective start zone (Watson\u2013Williams test, <i>P</i>: 1.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>, n = 588 (left), 1305 (right); Rayleigh test; <i>P</i>: left, 1.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221256</sup>, right, 4.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u2212324</sup>) and stem (Watson\u2013Williams test, <i>P</i>: 1.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>, n = 257 (left), 395 (right); Rayleigh test; <i>P</i>: left, 1.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u2212235</sup>, right, 5.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u2212125</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This suggests that the rats sampled a memory-guided goal in preparation for switching to either the NA or the DA subtask. In this experiment, head direction is therefore considered a behavioral sign indicating expected future choice. In erroneous trials, however, head direction was ambiguous only in the maze stem (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>; Watson\u2013Williams test, (2C) <i>P</i>: 4.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>, n = 29 (left), 30 (right), (2D) <i>P</i>: 0.29, n = 26 (left), 10 (right); Rayleigh test, <i>P</i>: (2C) left, 3.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>, right, 8.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221218</sup>, (2D) left, 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221214</sup>, right, 5.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22127</sup>). Considering that the barrier in the maze stem would have been an indication to the rats of the ongoing DA subtask, this suggests that the spatial memory demand in preparation for NA/DA subtasks decreased within the maze stem. In addition, prior to making erroneous choices, the rats did not make a decision at the behavioral level within the maze stem."

To avoid confusing replay and sequential activation during movement-related phase precession, population bursts of spiking activity during periods of awake immobility, when rats were moving less than 2 cm/s, were identified as candidate replays (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Of a total of 2820 candidates, 552 were identified as statistically significant replays with a continuous path, whose length and duration satisfied several criteria (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davidson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>) (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). LFPs during the path replays were largely coincident with the SWRs (99.8%; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), and their theta power (4\u201312 Hz) was significantly smaller than during running (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This confirms that the path replays identified here were similar to those reported previously (<a href=\"#bib13\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Davidson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>) and did not include low-speed replay events associated with theta oscillation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Johnson and Redish, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jezek et al., 2011</a>)."

The middle portions of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> show nine representative decoded paths from the spiking activity shown in the raster plots during candidate replays. As the spike raster plots suggest, the decoded paths also began where the rats paused and moved forward toward a goal in the corresponding trial type. In addition, despite the fact that the actual goal in the VD<sub>RR</sub> trial was on the right side, the decoded path ended on the left side (green arrow), suggesting that the replay represents an upcoming path to a memory-guided goal (i.e., opposite to the previous goal). Across all replays, the posterior probability of decoded locations was spatially concentrated around the vicinity of the goal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To statistically compare the strength of path representation in the replays between selected regions, path representation strength was defined as the sum total of the posterior probability. Path representation in the vicinity of both goals was significantly greater than in the remainder of the maze area (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 3.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u2212106</sup>, n = 552). As awake replay often begins at the animal's current location (<a href=\"#bib13\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2007</a>) and is enhanced by rewarding outcomes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Singer and Frank, 2009</a>), the replay may be initiated at the goal. Although reward expectation increases occupancy time and place-field representation around the goals, such initiation bias was not correlated with either occupancy time (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>) or spatial distribution of place-field representation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B,D</a>). This suggests that the path replays were not a simple consequence of either reward expectation or place-specific firings in the location where they occurred (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gupta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Carr et al., 2011</a>). Rather, they may represent paths on a memory-guided journey towards an upcoming goal (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>), or on the immediately preceding journey (<a href=\"#bib28\">O'Neill et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</a>)."

The path replays predominantly occurred in the start zone and in the maze stem (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Unlike the start zones, the maze stem was common to all journeys. There were therefore two types of path replays: path-start and path-stem. I centered the posterior probability of decoded locations on the start position and rotated it according to the direction of the memory-guided goal. As expected from the initiation bias, the rats' current location was strongly represented in the posterior probability of decoded locations in path-start replays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To statistically test the difference between future and past journeys, I defined future and past regions as those from the start position to memory-guided and previous goals, respectively. It is worth noting that the memory-guided goal was always opposite to the previous goal even in visually guided trials (VD<sub>LL</sub>, VD<sub>RR</sub>), because the task design did not allow the rats to identify the subtask until they reached the junction (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Path representation (i.e., the sum total of the posterior probabilities of decoded locations) of future regions was significantly greater than that of past regions in the correct spatial alternation trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.0037, n = 345). Similarly, future regions were strongly and statistically significantly represented in the correct visually guided trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>; p = 0.0078, n = 52). In erroneous trials, path representation of future regions was slightly greater than that of past regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), but the difference was not significant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>; p = 0.73, n = 9). However, due to the physically different start zones of different journeys, these characteristics may be affected by the place-specificity of the locations in which the replays occurred."

Path representation was similar to that in the replays that occurred in the start zones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,I</a>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>: p = 9.8 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, n = 190; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>: p = 0.034, n = 38). Surprisingly, however, path representation in path-stem replays on journeys toward an erroneous goal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>) was significantly different from that on journeys toward a correct goal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L</a>; p = 0.0078, n = 8), despite the fact that the rats sampled both goal sides evenly. Similar to the findings of a previous study (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>), this suggests that in the maze stem, where spatial memory retrieval is a prerequisite for predicting a future goal, path representation in the replay is directly linked to the animal's future path."

I therefore reanalyzed the path replays using point estimates of locations based on a posteriori probability. Similar to the posterior probability analyses, the decoded locations in the replays tended to represent an upcoming journey to a memory-guided goal (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To corroborate the results from the Bayesian decoder, I furthermore applied a simple spatial reconstruction algorithm, based on place fields during running, to the path replays. To estimate path representation in the replay, the place maps of the maze in neurons participating in the replay were simply summed up in response to the number of spikes (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Similarly to the results obtained using the Bayesian decoder, the path representation estimated using the simple spatial reconstruction algorithm also largely predicted an upcoming path to a memory-guided goal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). A previous study (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>) reported that the awake replays represent an upcoming path to a memory-guided goal, but did not examine erroneous behaviors. My findings strongly support this view, with the additional finding that the upcoming path encoded in the awake replay can be linked to the animal's future actions."

For instance, consider the firing rate histograms for participating neurons in replays occurring in the start zone, central stem, or junction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). As expected from the timing of temporally compressed firings across place cells, the maximum firing rates of place cells during replays (\u223c80 Hz) were about 10 times faster than typical maximum firing rates during running (\u223c8 Hz). To estimate the exact temporal compression rate of place cell firing during replays, I divided the average interspike interval during candidate replays by that during the entire rest of the session. The median of the estimated compression rate was 9.0 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that similarly to the timing of firing, place cell firing rates were also temporally compressed during replays. During replays occurring at the junction, the raster plots of spiking activity in DA<sub>RL</sub> and VD<sub>RL</sub> trials recorded from rat II showed a similar activity sequence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, rightmost, arrows). The replays also depicted a similar decoded path. However, the firing rates during DA<sub>RL</sub> trials were substantially greater than during VD<sub>RL</sub> trials, suggesting that the firing rates of neurons participating in the replay may contain information on the differences between subtasks."

To address this question, episodic replays were divided into two types according to the occurrence location of the replay: episodic-start and episodic-stem replays. This was done because the head direction analyses suggested that spatial memory demand at the behavioral level was lower within the maze stem. The partitioning showed that the subtask bias occurred in episodic-start replays (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; VD vs DA: p = 3.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup>; NA vs DA: p = 5.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22127</sup>), but not in episodic-stem replays (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Similarly, in the path-start replays, all candidates and SWR events showed such a bias (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). This bias may be accounted for by occupancy time while the rats paused. However, since the rats specifically spent more time pausing in the DA subtask in both the start zones and the maze stem (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), the bias cannot be explained by the time spent pausing. Combined with behavioral signs of decreased spatial memory demand within the maze stem, these results suggest that the occurrence rate of replays is enhanced by upcoming spatial working memory demand. In contrast, the subtasks predicted from the episodic replays did not show such a bias, and instead the prediction rates reflected the ratio of subtasks experienced throughout the entire session (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This suggests that the enhancement is not specifically due to the reactivated DA subtask, but instead due to the reactivation of all previously experienced subtasks."

Even if the replay can represent an upcoming path, disambiguation of the subtasks is still required for identifying the actual trial type. I therefore investigated the relationship between the actual trial type to be rewarded and trial-type representation in the episodic replays. Since the path representation suggested that the replay encodes an upcoming path to a memory-guided goal, I only examined the memory-guided trial types (i.e., VD<sub>LR</sub>, VD<sub>RL</sub>, NA<sub>LR</sub>, NA<sub>RL</sub>, DA<sub>LR</sub>, and DA<sub>RL</sub>).

Trial-type representation matched actual trial type moderately well in replays at the junction (i.e., the decision point) where the rats could evidently identify the actual trial type based on the visual cue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>; Choen's \u03ba = 0.58; p = 3.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, n = 17), but not at the center of the stem (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>; Choen's \u03ba = 0.022; p = 0.93, n = 17). To corroborate these results, the Bayesian decoder in the trial-type prediction method was replaced by the simple spatial reconstruction algorithm. Similarly, trial types predicted using this method matched actual trial types moderately well only in replays at the junction (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To further check whether the predicted and actual trial types were coincidently matched, the probability of trial-type prediction across all replays occurring at the junction was analyzed on a time-window basis. There was a significant effect of the probability of trial-type prediction for five trial types (NA<sub>LR</sub>, DA<sub>LR</sub>, VD<sub>RL</sub>, NA<sub>RL</sub>, and DA<sub>RL</sub>) in episodic replays (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.01; <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

The number of visual cues showing did not account for VD representation, even at the junction (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test, p = 0.20). The barrier that appeared at the center of the stem only in DA trials may also represent a sensory cue, which would distinguish NA from DA trials.

However, such episodic-like memory traces are present across time-scales similar to those during the actual experience, and are thus distinct from the rapid, temporally compressed replays reported here. Although numerous previous reports have concluded that place cell activity sequences are reactivated in a temporally compressed manner in the awake state (<a href=\"#bib13\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">O'Neill et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Singer and Frank, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gupta et al., 2010</a>) as well as during slow-wave sleep (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</a>), they have shown only that replays encode familiar paths. Until now, the possibility that replays simultaneously represent both spatial and non-spatial information has been purely conjectural. It is well known that spatial information is encoded in temporally compressed firing timings across place cells in replays. I have now shown that replays also encode non-spatial information in temporally compressed firing rates, revealing that global and rate remapping mechanisms during running (<a href=\"#bib23\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Takahashi, 2013</a>) are preserved in the temporally compressed replays that occur during brief periods of immobility."

Contradicting with this hypothesis, growing evidence suggests that replays are not a simple function of experience (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gupta et al., 2010</a>), but rather that reward outcomes enhance the reactivation of experiences (<a href=\"#bib34\">Singer and Frank, 2009</a>) and that replays can depict future paths to remembered goals (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</a>). In addition, awake replays often begin at the animal's current location (<a href=\"#bib8\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2007</a>). The relationship between replay content and experience therefore does not seem to be straightforward. Some previous reports suggest that awake replay is similar to vicarious trial-and-error (VTE) events (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hu and Amsel, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Johnson and Redish, 2007</a>), because it can represent possible future paths even in completely unfamiliar places (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gupta et al., 2010</a>). Although VTE events are reported to occur outside of SWRs, a subsequent study suggested that awake replay associated with SWRs is seen frequently at the choice point in a similar task, where animals must make a memory-guided decision between two journeys (<a href=\"#bib22\">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</a>). Consistent with activity observed in VTE events, these awake replays extend out to the left or right arms of the track, as would be expected if the animal were playing out possible upcoming choices. Frank et al. therefore proposed a unified interpretation in which replays provide information on possible upcoming paths to downstream brain structures such as the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, which can assess the value of different paths and make a decision about future actions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carr et al., 2011</a>)."

However, the task design did not allow prediction of the subtask until the animal had entered the decision point. This suggests that not only the path but also the subtask representation in the replay is similar to VTE events. By extending the unified interpretation to include non-spatial memory in the retrieved memory, the fact that replays in the present study reflected all previously experienced trial types (except at the decision point) suggests that replays prepare the brain for unforeseen changes, which would allow continuous switching between subtasks."

Since the initiation of an awake replay is often related to external spatial input at the animal's location (<a href=\"#bib22\">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</a>), this enhancement of replays suggests that the internal demand of the hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory is another factor. Considering that this is similar to a cued memory retrieval process, my findings strongly support the hypothesis that awake replay plays a key role in episodic-like memory retrieval, which contributes to memory-based navigational planning and decision making (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carr et al., 2011</a>)."

As a result, a fairly large proportion of events representing different and multiple experiences can spontaneously occur, even in naive animals. I speculate that the reason why paths and subtasks were encoded in temporally compressed firing timings and rates, respectively, in the replays may be to arrange such multiple preplayed episodes into a single replay event to easily recall and imagine an upcoming episode based on prior experience. In the present study, the rats were sequentially trained in the VD, NA, and DA subtasks. Together with the preplay mechanism, this training protocol might have helped to recruit a consistent path representation across the three subtasks. Until now, previous studies investigating the content of preplays have primarily focused on the geography and timeline of the animals' running. Non-spatial information in the preplay may provide further insight into memory encoding and retrieval."

A custom-made microdrive with 10 independently movable dodecatrodes was then fixed to the skull above the left hippocampus (AP 3.8, ML 3.0, DV 0.5). A week after surgery, the electrodes were individually lowered into the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal CA1. The extracellular signals were unity-gain buffered, filtered (600 Hz\u20136 kHz), amplified (gain = 5000), and continuously sampled at 25 kHz. One channel of each electrode was duplicated for detecting LFPs and was filtered (0.1 Hz\u20136 kHz) and amplified (gain = 500). The LFP recordings were further band-pass filtered (150\u2013250 Hz) using the Hilbert transform. Data recorded during the MFB stimulation were removed prior to analysis. Local peaks in the power of this filtered signal of magnitude &gt;mean + 3SD were identified and extracted as periods. The boundaries for each period were defined as the point at which the amplitude crossed the mean. Periods during which running speed was &lt;2 cm/s were identified as SWR events. For theta-wave detection, the z-score power of a band-pass filtered (4\u201312 Hz) signal was calculated. After spike sorting as previously described (<a href=\"#bib37\">Takahashi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Takahashi and Sakurai, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Takahashi, 2013</a>), putative principal cells were distinguished from putative fast-spiking cells based on spike width (0.4 ms) and average firing rate (5 Hz). Cells whose firing rate was &lt;0.1 Hz were excluded. Only the putative principal cells were used in the analyses described below. Spikes during delay periods in the DA subtask, when hippocampal activity was not place-specific (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pastalkova et al., 2008</a>), were excluded."

A candidate replay was defined as a period where the smoothed (Gaussian kernel; SD: 10 ms) population activity was greater than the mean and the peak was above the defined threshold (mean + 3SD). To minimize ambiguous detections, periods were decreased based on the following criteria. Time windows were reduced as much as possible such that at least 10% of all detected cells were detected within the time window, each cell included at least two spikes, and the duration was at least 30 ms. Secondly, for each period, the rat's location was decoded using the Bayesian decoder, for 20-ms time windows advanced in 5-ms increments. Periods were concatenated when the distance between neighboring decoded locations was less than 25 cm. Thirdly, concatenated periods whose sequence of decoded locations covered a total distance greater than that covered during four time windows were classified as candidate replays. Fourthly, two significance tests were conducted for every candidate, using a Monte Carlo method with two different random shuffling modes: cell identity and cell place field (5000 times each). Finally, candidates with p &lt; 0.05 for both shuffle modes were defined as path replays."

As a result, a fairly large proportion of events representing different and multiple experiences can spontaneously occur, even in na\u00efve animals. I speculate that the reason why paths and subtasks were encoded in temporally compressed firing timings and rates, respectively, in the replays may be to arrange such multiple preplayed episodes into a single replay event to easily recall and imagine an upcoming episode based on prior experience. In the present study, the rats were sequentially trained in the VD, NA and DA subtasks. Together with the preplay mechanism, this training protocol might have helped to recruit a consistent path representation across the three subtasks.

In the visually guided trials, only one of the visual cues was present at the junction. I then investigated whether the trial type encoded in the replay was just a representation of the available sensory cues. To this end, I examined whether the difference in the number of visual cues (one or both) could be used to distinguish VD from the other subtasks encoded in replays occurring at the junction, which was not the case (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; Cohen's \u03ba = 0. 22, P = 0.35, n =18). I also investigated whether the barrier that appeared at the center of the stem in the DA trials could be a sensory cue that distinguishes NA from DA. However, the subtask predicted at the center of the stem did not match the actual NA and DA subtasks (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>; Cohen's \u03ba = 0. 27, P = 0.615, n=9). These results suggest that the trial type representation in the replay is more than just a representation of external cues. I have added these results to <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>."

There was a significant effect of probability of trial type prediction for five trial types (NALR, DALR, VDRL, NARL and DARL) in episodic replays (ANOVA, P &lt; 0.01). Predicted trial types that showed the highest probability in replays matched the actual ones for NALR, VDRL, NARL and DARL trials. Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that the predicted trial types with the highest probabilities were significantly different from most of the others, suggesting that matches were not coincidental.

As my previous study reported (<a href=\"#bib36\">Takahashi 2013</a>), differences between subtasks are encoded in firing rates across place cells. Therefore, using a prediction method based on these firing rates (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen et al. 2012</a>), I predicted trial type from the firing rate pattern across place cells in conjunction with the decoded path. The bottom portion of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows trial types predicted from rat I in a single trial. In the visually guided VDRR and VDLL trials, some mismatches occurred because the rats could not accurately predict the trial type until they reached the junction. The predictions were most accurate for the spatial alternation trials. Confusion matrices between predicted and actual trial types for each rat during the entire session (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) show that a similar pattern was observed for all rats.\u201d"
