                    "text": "In fission yeast, the <i>ste11</i> gene encodes the master regulator initiating the switch from vegetative growth to gametogenesis. In a previous paper, we showed that the methylation of H3K4 and consequent promoter nucleosome deacetylation repress <i>ste11</i> induction and cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Materne et al., 2015</a>) but the regulatory steps remain poorly understood. Here we report a genetic screen that highlighted H2B deubiquitylation and the RSC remodeling complex as activators of <i>ste11</i> expression. Mechanistic analyses revealed more complex, opposite roles of H2Bubi at the promoter where it represses expression, and over the transcribed region where it sustains it. By promoting H3K4 methylation at the promoter, H2Bubi initiates the deacetylation process, which decreases chromatin remodeling by RSC. Upon induction, this process is reversed and efficient NDR (<span class=\"underline\">n</span>ucleosome <span class=\"underline\">d</span>epleted <span class=\"underline\">r</span>egion) formation leads to high expression. Therefore, H2Bubi represses gametogenesis by opposing the recruitment of RSC at the promoter of the master regulator <i>ste11</i> gene."

In a previous paper, we showed that the methylation of H3K4 and consequent promoter nucleosome deacetylation repress <i>ste11</i> induction and cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Materne et al., 2015</a>) but the regulatory steps remain poorly understood. Here we report a genetic screen that highlighted H2B deubiquitylation and the RSC remodeling complex as activators of <i>ste11</i> expression. Mechanistic analyses revealed more complex, opposite roles of H2Bubi at the promoter where it represses expression, and over the transcribed region where it sustains it. By promoting H3K4 methylation at the promoter, H2Bubi initiates the deacetylation process, which decreases chromatin remodeling by RSC. Upon induction, this process is reversed and efficient NDR (<span class=\"underline\">n</span>ucleosome <span class=\"underline\">d</span>epleted <span class=\"underline\">r</span>egion) formation leads to high expression. Therefore, H2Bubi represses gametogenesis by opposing the recruitment of RSC at the promoter of the master regulator <i>ste11</i> gene."

The distribution of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) mirrors S5P due to the direct recruitment of the H3 methyltransferase Set1-COMPASS by the S5P of PolII (<a href=\"#bib32\">Keogh et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ng et al., 2003</a>). In budding yeast, Set1 is the only H3K4 methyltransferase and plays a repressive role on <i>PHO5, PHO84</i> and <i>GAL1</i> expression, suggesting that H3K4me creates a repressive chromatin configuration (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvin and Kladde, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Most genes are also upregulated in fission yeast when Set1 is absent (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lorenz et al., 2014</a>). The PHD finger protein Set3, which is part of the SET3C HDAC complex, binds H3K4me2 to mediate deacetylation of histones in the 5\u2019 regions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, the PHD domain of the HDAC-associated ING2 protein mediates its binding to the di- and trimethylated H3K4 at the promoters of proliferation genes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pena et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shi et al., 2006</a>)."

In yeast, Rad6 and Bre1 function as conjugating enzyme (E2) or ligase (E3) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hwang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Robzyk et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wood et al., 2003</a>). The pathway is conserved in fission yeast with the Rhp6 E2 and two Bre1 homologues, Brl1 and Brl2, a situation closer to higher eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tanny et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zofall and Grewal, 2007</a>). The presence of the Ubp8 deubiquitylase, which is part of the SAGA co-activator complex, underlies the dynamic nature of H2Bubi (<a href=\"#bib13\">Daniel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Henry et al., 2003</a>). A second deubiquitylase, Ubp10, modulates the pool of H2Bubi (<a href=\"#bib18\">Emre et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gardner et al., 2005</a>). H2Bubi functions in a trans-tail regulation of H3K4 and H3K79 methylation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Briggs et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dover et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ng et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sun and Allis, 2002</a>). The Set1-COMPASS subunit Swd2 is required for the crosstalk by mechanisms implying its direct ubiquitylation by Rad6-Bre1 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Vitaliano-Prunier et al., 2008</a>) or its recruitment by H2B-ub1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2007</a>). H2Bubi is spread uniformly across transcribed units and at promoters (<a href=\"#bib3\">Batta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schulze et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">2009</a>). Ubp8 acts at the 5\u2019 region where H3K4me3 is also high while Ubp10 targets the H3K79me3 decorated nucleosomes more typical of 3\u2019 regions, which suggests different, maybe opposite, roles of H2Bubi over the length of genes and spatial regulation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schulze et al., 2011</a>). Nucleosome occupancy (<a href=\"#bib3\">Batta et al., 2011</a>) in a strain lacking H2Bubi revealed a role in promoting nucleosome assembly leading to repression at promoters and a positive role during elongation by facilitating the eviction of the H2A-H2B dimer and nucleosome reassembly following the passage of the polymerase. However, how H2Bubi represses transcription at the promoter is not clear."

RSC recognizes acetylated nucleosomes through tandem bromodomains (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kasten et al., 2004</a>), which links its recruitment to acetylation of histone H3 lysine 14."

A H2B K119R mutant results in decreased nucleosome occupancy at the <i>ste11</i> promoter and derepression of the gene, while the absence of RSC has the opposite effect.

It is therefore likely that the efficient transcription of one or several genes controlling cytokinesis requires S2P. Testing the LatA sensitivity of the genes we have previously identified (<a href=\"#bib12\">Coudreuse et al., 2010</a>) as downregulated in a S2A mutant identified the essential SIN (Septation Initiation Network) component encoding gene <i>cdc14</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fankhauser and Simanis, 1993</a>) as a potential transcriptional target of Lsk1. The overexpression of <i>cdc14</i> significantly suppresses the LatA sensitivity of a strain deleted for <i>lsk1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), supporting that the LatA sensitivity of the <i>lsk1</i> mutant relates to the downregulation of <i>cdc14</i>."

We therefore screened the entire <i>S. pombe</i> deletion library for sensitivity to the presence of 0.5\u2009\u03bcM LatA. The screen is not expected to be very specific as many regulators of the actomyosin ring and cytokinesis were already shown to be sensitive to LatA but transcriptional regulators should easily be extracted from that group based on annotation. The sensitivity of the S2A mutation within the CTD is specific as an S7A mutant behaves as wild type (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The screening appeared to be consistent as the three kinases (Pmk1, Pek1 and Mkh1) forming the MAPK cell integrity transduction pathway were isolated. In addition, we identified the SAGA-associated Ubp8 H2B ubiquitin protease and several components of the RSC and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes.

Similarly to <i>cdc14</i>, we observed that the abolition of H2Bubi led to an increase of <i>ste11</i>, including at the basal, non-induced state, supporting that ubiquitylation of H2B represses <i>ste11</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

We tested the specificity of a new monoclonal antibody in fission yeast to avoid the caveats of using a tagged version. Despite two amino acid changes in the predicted epitope (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), the antibody specifically recognized the ubiquitylated version of H2B as no signal was observed in a K119R mutant (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Humanizing the fission yeast gene (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) in order to generate the exact epitope did not improve recognition, indicating that the antibody could be used on a wild type strain. The H2Bubi signal appeared increased in the <i>ubp8</i> deletion strain but not in the absence of <i>ubp16</i> that encodes the closest fission yeast orthologue to <i>ScUBP10</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kouranti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sadeghi et al., 2014</a>). The double <i>ubp8 ubp16</i> mutant had similar level of H2Bubi to the single <i>ubp8</i> mutant, suggesting that Ubp8 is the genuine H2B deubiquitylase in fission yeast as previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sadeghi et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

A reverse pattern was observed at the promoter and 3\u2019-distal region with H2Bubi occupancy decreasing at the promoter and increasing along the transcribed unit during gene induction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, left panel). Considering the dependency of H3K4me to H2Bubi, we also followed the trimethyl mark (H3K4me3) that behaved similarly to H2Bubi at the promoter but was very low in the 3\u2019 region of <i>ste11</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, right panel). Therefore, the use of the <i>htb1 K119R</i> mutant confirmed that the deposition of H3K4me3 requires previous H2B ubiquitylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, right panel). We reasoned that the opposite dynamic of H2Bubi at the promoter and 3\u2019 region could reflect that the ubiquitylation represses transcription at the promoter while it promotes it during elongation, which could explain why both the <i>htb1 K119R</i> and the <i>ubp8</i> deletion mutant lead to increased expression of <i>ste11</i>. In addition, our recent work indicated that H3K4me3 represses <i>ste11</i> expression by recruiting the SET3C HDAC, which is counteracted by Lsk1-dependent S2P (<a href=\"#bib39\">Materne et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, in the <i>htb1 K119R</i> strain where H3K4me3 is downregulated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, right panel), Lsk1 and S2P would not be required, which is what we observe both genetically (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and by RT-Q-PCR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We further tested this model by measuring the level of H3 at the promoter of various strains. Confirming our previous data, the deletion of <i>lsk1</i> or the mutation of H3 lysine 14 to arginine (Htt2 K14R) led to an elevated level of H3 onto the promoter region while the <i>htb1 K119R</i> mutant, or a strain lacking <i>hos2</i> (encoding the catalytic subunit of the SET3C HDAC) had a reduction of histone occupancy at the <i>ste11</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Importantly, the level of histone observed in the absence of <i>ubp8</i> was very similar to the wild type, indicating that the upregulation of <i>ste11</i> expression proceeds through a different mechanism, as already suggested above."

The absence of either <i>rsc1</i> or <i>arp9</i> clearly affected the expression of <i>ste11</i> while <i>snf22</i> had no effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), pointing to a more prominent role of RSC for <i>ste11</i> expression, which was confirmed by a gametogenesis assay (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

However, available data from other systems support that H3K4me3 rather correlates with high turnover nucleosomes near the transcription initiation site and this mark is recognized by the histone acetyltransferase complexes NuA3 and NuA4 via the PHD domain of the ING proteins Yng1 and Yng2 (Png1 and Png2 in fission yeast). We therefore tested the effect of inactivating NuA3 and NuA4 by combining a deletion of <i>mst2,</i> encoding the catalytic subunit of NuA3 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gomez et al., 2005</a>), with a <i>ts</i> allele of <i>mst1,</i> encoding the catalytic subunit of NuA3 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gomez et al., 2008</a>).

A meta-gene analysis of the nucleosome occupancy signal for all protein-coding genes revealed higher occupancy upstream of the TSS in the <i>rsc1</i> mutant, and an average 13 bp shift of the \u22121 nucleosome toward the TSS was noted (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>) when selecting the 10% protein-coding genes whose promoter nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) shrinks the most in the absence of Rsc1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, right panel).

Remarkably, these genes also showed higher nucleosome occupancy close to their TSS in the absence of Rsc1, indicating a mechanistic connection between the abolition of CTD S2P and the absence of Rsc1. Comparing the subset of genes whose promoter nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) shrinks the most in the absence of either Rsc1 or in the absence of S2P revealed a significant overlap (p<i>=3.416e-06</i>).

A recent study proposed that Set1 represses the transcriptome independently of H3K4 methylation and is recruited by the Atf1 transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lorenz et al., 2014</a>). However, three previous studies have shown that Atf1 functions as an activator, rather than a repressor at the <i>ste11</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kanoh et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shiozaki and Russell, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Takeda et al., 1995</a>) and a H3K4R mutant also derepresses <i>ste11</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Materne et al., 2015</a>).

This is at first sight hard to explain as removal of histone modifications are expected to oppose the effect of their addition, such as in the acetylation/deacetylation process. However, a similar case was reported at the <i>GAL1</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib27\">Henry et al., 2003</a>), already underlying the complex dynamic of H2Bubi where the sequential addition and removal of the mark is required for proper induction. Although the <i>ubp8</i> and <i>htb1 K119R</i> both result in elevated <i>ste11</i> expression, only the <i>htb1 K119R</i> suppresses the requirement of the S2 kinase Lsk1, which indicates that the positive effects of the addition and removal of the mark may operate through unrelated mechanisms. This is backed up by the spatially opposite behaviour of the H2Bubi mark over the <i>ste11</i> locus. The fact that the double <i>lsk1 ubp8</i> mutant behaves as the single <i>lsk1</i> mutant suggests that the function of <i>lsk1</i> is required upstream of <i>ubp8</i>. Indeed if Ubp8 positively affects elongation by facilitating the eviction of the H2A-H2B dimer and nucleosome reassembly in the wake of the polymerase (<a href=\"#bib3\">Batta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pavri et al., 2006</a>), it is expected that this effect will be masked by the strong defect in polymerase occupancy at the promoter observed when <i>lsk1</i> is absent. The positive effect of <i>ubp8</i> on elongation is likely to occur independently of H3K4 methylation as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tanny et al., 2007</a>) and maybe related to the positive role of H2Bubi in non-coding transcription at heterochromatic loci (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sadeghi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zofall and Grewal, 2007</a>)."

Upon transcriptional induction, the recruitment of SAGA-associated Ubp8 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Helmlinger et al., 2008</a>) removes the ubiquitin mark, and concomitantly, the MAP kinase-dependent recruitment of Lsk1 deposits higher level of S2P. These two unrelated processes impede the Set1-dependent recruitment and/or activation of the SET3C HDAC, which provides access of the transcription machinery to the larger NDR that is formed. From the genetic analyses, as <i>ste11</i> is highly transcribed in the <i>ubp8</i> mutant, it appears that the S2P-dependent induction of transcription can bypass the requirement of de-ubiquitylation dependent on Ubp8."

The crosslink was stopped by the addition of 27\u2009ml of Glycine and cells were pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in preincubation solution (Citric acid 20\u2009mM, Na2HPO4 20\u2009mM, EDTA pH 8 40\u2009mM) supplemented with 100 \u00b5l \u03b2 mercaptoethanol/50ml and incubated 10 min at 30\u00b0C. The cells were centrifugated and resuspended in 10\u2009ml of Sorbitol 1\u2009M / Tris pH 7.4 50\u2009mM buffer containing 200 \u00b5l Zymolase (0,01g/200\u00a0\u00b5l water) and incubated 20 min at 30\u00b0C (40 min when EMM medium was used).

Add 50\u00a0\u00b5l MNase (32 units) to one tube and incubate 20 min at 37\u00b0C without agitation. Add 500\u00a0\u00b5l Stop buffer, 200 \u00b5l RNase A (0.4 mg/ml) and 225\u00a0\u00b5l proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubate at 65\u00b0C overnight. Potassium Acetate was added (1.25\u2009ml of a 3M solution) and the mix was incubated 5 min on ice. After phenol extraction, 200\u00a0\u00b5l NaCl 5\u00a0M, 1.7\u00a0\u00b5l Glycogene (20\u00a0mg/ml), and 3.5\u2009ml of isopropanol were added. After precipitation and ethanol wash, the pellet was resuspended in 200 \u00b5l of TE buffer. The samples were run on agarose gel (1.5%) and the bands corresponding to the mononucleosomes were cut and purify with Qiagen. Q-PCR with the primer pairs of the set of overlapping amplicons were performed. Nucleosomal DNA enrichment calculated as the ratio between the amounts of PCR product obtained from DNA samples generated from the mononucleosomal gel purification to that of the input (total) DNA."

Clonal reads (determined by their very high coverage compared to the mean coverage across the genome based on a Poisson P-value cutoff) were removed from the reads previously mapped on the <i>S.pombe</i> genome with BWA (bio-bwa.sourceforge.net). Variation in size resulting from MNase treatment were compensated by shifting each read toward the 3\u2019 direction for half of the estimated fragment size. Nucleosome occupancy was then calculated as the quantile-normalized count of adjusted reads covering each base pair in the genome. Afer this processing, DANPOS calculates the differential signal at single nucleotide position based on a Poisson test. Dynamic nucleosomes are then identified by peak calling on these signals. TSS associated NDR lengths were quantified as the length of the longest DNA segment whose proximal border is located closer than 65 bp from the TSS with nucleosome occupancy levels lower than an arbitrary treshold (mean(occupancy<sub>genome</sub>) \u2013 standard_deviation(occupancy<sub>genome</sub>)) at any point."

However, they also felt that you needed to go beyond investigating <i>ste11</i> as a model locus to broaden the general appeal of the work, by incorporating new MNase and ChIP-seq data sets. There are other examples where the H3K4me3 has been shown to be repressive because it recruits a complex containing HDAC activity and a PHD-containing subunit that reads the histone mark. For example, at PHO5, H3K4me3 is both positive during activation in S/G2/M and repressive during mitotic exit when the Rpd3L HDAC is recruited via two PHD-containing subunits. The step forward in your paper is the identification of RSC in the genetic screen and its placement at the end of the pathway identified in the previous <i>eLife</i> paper. It could be argued, though, that reduced acetylation would be expected to impair recruitment of RSC. Given that one could question how big a step the present manuscript is, I would also support requesting the genome-wide datasets to broaden general appeal beyond <i>ste11</i>."

H2B ubiquitin protease Ubp8 and some components of RSC and SWI/SNF complex were identified, which suggests potential link between H2B-ub1/chromatin remodeling and S2P pathway. In fission yeast gametogenesis, <i>ste11</i> is a key transcriptional master regulator. The authors focus on <i>ste11</i> transcription, as their previous recent paper showed that <i>ste11</i> is regulated by S2P and by Set1 K4me-repression. Here they show that <i>ste11</i> is repressed by H2Bub and activated by RSC. It is proposed that, via Set1-H3K4me3-HDAC pathway, H2Bub lowers RSC recruitment to ste11 promoter and regulates local nucleosomal occupancy and therefore transcription. These results may explain how H2B-ub at the promoter represses <i>ste11</i> transcription."

In that study, they presented genome-wide nucleosome mapping data in fission yeast, <i>S. pombe</i>, showing that the absence of phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) on serine 2 (S2) led to increased nucleosome occupancy and repositioning in the promoters of a subset of yeast genes. The affected promoters generally had a larger nucleosome depleted region (NDR) than the majority of genes, and included the <i>ste11</i> gene, which the authors previously found had a peak of S2 phosporylation (S2P) near the promoter during its activation. They showed that the peak of S2P at <i>ste11</i> and a second promoter reduced nucleosome occupancy and increased histone acetylation during gene activation. The take home message from these and other studies in this first manuscript was that during activation S2P counteracts repressive histone deacetylation by SET3C, which is targeted to promoters via its interaction with RNAP II-S5P/Set1-mediated H3K4 methylated histones. The dual presence of S2P and S5P was also found to block Set1 interaction with the CTD."

Their examination was restricted to H2B monoubiquitylation (H2B-ub1) and the RSC nucleosome-remodeling complex, which were identified in a screen for mutants that relieved the drug sensitivity of lsk1, the fission yeast S2 CTD kinase. By analyzing loss of function mutations coupled with RNA analysis and ChIP, the authors report that an htb1KR mutation suppressed the transcription defect of a lsk1 deletion and that H2B-ub1 was localized to the <i>ste11</i> promoter under basal (repressed) conditions. As expected, its promoter occupancy positively correlated with the occupancy of H3K4me3. Consistent with a role in promoter repression through its trans-regulation of H3K4me3, an htb1-KR mutant showed reduced nucleosome occupancy in the ste11 promoter. In contrast, mutations that decreased RSC expression had the opposite phenotype \u2013 <i>ste11</i> transcription was reduced and nucleosome occupancy was increased in the promoter. The authors propose that H2B-ub1 represses transcription of <i>ste11</i> by opposing RSC-dependent nucleosome remodeling."

The screen identified SAGA-associated Ubp8, a ubiquitin (ub) protease that removes monoubiquitin from H2B, as well as shared and non-shared subunits of the chromatin remodelers RSC and SWI/SNF (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The identification of Ubp8 is not unexpected as it is well documented that H2Bub is required for trans-modification of H3 and promoter accumulation of H3K4me3, which recruits SET3C HDAC activity to <i>ste11</i>. Nevertheless, using ChIP (using a newly available monoclonal antibody) the authors convincingly show that the level of H2Bub1 at the <i>ste11</i> correlates with the presence of H3K4me3, and both histone marks decrease on activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Consistent with this, a H2BK119R mutation, which abolishes H2Bub1 and hence H3K4me3 at the <i>ste11</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), decreased H3 occupancy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and increased both basal and induced levels of ste11 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Loss of SWI/SNF and RSC subunits demonstrated that RSC, but not SWI/SNF, is required for nucleosome depletion of the <i>ste11</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-B</a>) and its activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B-F</a>). As shown by ChIP, RSC is recruited specifically to the <i>ste11</i> promoter as opposed to the gene body, and this recruitment increases when H2Bub1 is abolished by H2BK119R (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A-B</a>). Conversely, RSC recruitment is decreased in the absence of H3K14ac (H3K14R mutant) and lsk1\u2206 cells, which lack S2P that is needed to inhibit H2B ubiquitylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C-D</a>). Genetic (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and RT-Q-PCR (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, evidence is also presented indicating that Cdc14 is a downstream target of Lsk1 and thus requires S2P as well as the remodelers Rsc and SWI/SNF for activation."
