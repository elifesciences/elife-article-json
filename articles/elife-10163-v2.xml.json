Critical differences may reside in the mean strength of responses to visual stimuli, as reflected in bulk signals detectable in functional magnetic resonance imaging, electro-encephalogram, or magnetoencephalography studies, or may be more subtly composed of differentiated activity of individual sensory neurons. Quantifying single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to visual stimuli recorded with in vivo two-photon imaging, we found that visual detection correlates more strongly with population response heterogeneity rather than overall response strength. Moreover, neuronal populations showed consistencies in activation patterns across temporally spaced trials in association with hit responses, but not during nondetections. Contrary to models relying on temporally stable networks or bulk signaling, these results suggest that detection depends on transient differentiation in neuronal activity within cortical populations."

Quantifying single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to visual stimuli recorded with in vivo two-photon imaging, we found that visual detection correlates more strongly with population response heterogeneity rather than overall response strength. Moreover, neuronal populations showed consistencies in activation patterns across temporally spaced trials in association with hit responses, but not during nondetections. Contrary to models relying on temporally stable networks or bulk signaling, these results suggest that detection depends on transient differentiation in neuronal activity within cortical populations."

To investigate this, Montijn et al. trained mice to lick a reward spout that gave out sugar water when they perceived a particular image. A technique called two-photon calcium imaging was then used to simultaneously record the activity of tens to hundreds of neurons in part of the brain called the visual cortex as the mice performed the perception task."

However, differences in the strength of the responses of the individual neurons in the group reflected perception more strongly: when a mouse perceived the image and licked in response, a heterogeneous (non-uniform) set of neuronal responses occurred. The diversity of the neuronal responses could also be used to predict how quickly a mouse would respond to an image. These activity differences would not be picked up by techniques that detect the average activity of many neurons, explaining why these effects had not previously been seen."

Visual perception has been proposed to arise from interactions between stimulus-specific processing in V1 and neural activity in higher visual and frontoparietal areas, involving both feed-forward propagation of activity and recurrent, top-down feedback (<a href=\"#bib75\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Britten and van Wezel, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lamme et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Haynes et al., 2005</a>). Critical in unraveling neural correlates of vision is how detected and undetected stimuli are processed differently, especially when these stimuli are physically identical. For instance, it has been suggested that the intensity, duration, and reproducibility of sensory neural activity may provide signatures critical for visual perception (e.g. <a href=\"#bib54\">Moutoussis and Zeki, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schurger et al., 2010</a>). In addition, it has been proposed that neural activity in V1 does not correlate with visual perception because stimuli that were seen or not seen evoked similar V1 blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signals (<a href=\"#bib80\">Vuilleumier et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Rees, 2000</a>), but this remains an area of substantial controversy (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ress and Heeger, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Palmer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Nienborg and Cumming, 2014</a>). In this context, it is important to recall that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electro-encephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalography\u00a0(MEG) rely on a mean-field approach, leaving open the possibility that neural correlates of perception may be coded in more subtle ways that take into account the local differentiation present in populations of sensory neurons."

Our first aim was to examine whether visual detection correlates with the mean visual response strength of V1 neurons or rather with other metrics of population responses, such as noise correlation or variance. This led us to develop a novel population metric\u2014response heterogeneity\u2014that correlates better with stimulus detection performance, and particularly with the animal\u2019s reaction time, than traditional measures by capturing the dissimilarity of neuronal responses within a population. Second, an assumption in many computational models of vision is that neurons in distributed cortical architectures have relatively fixed roles in encoding visual features, but modulate their activation in a temporally dynamic manner based on attentional needs that can influence perception (e.g. <a href=\"#bib40\">Jones and Palmer, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Itti et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Desimone, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Deco and Rolls, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</a>). To study whether modulations of neuronal activity that influence stimulus perception show temporally recurring patterns, we asked whether population activation patterns are more similar across trials that repeat the same stimulus presentation when the stimulus is successfully detected. We report that (1) visual stimulus detection does not correlate well with mean response strength, but is significantly correlated with population heterogeneity; (2) neuronal populations show consistencies in activation patterns across temporally spaced trials in association with hit responses, but not when the animal fails to report a stimulus; and (3) in addition to heterogeneity, multidimensional structures in neuronal population responses provide information on visual detection."

To acquire a sufficient range of hit/miss ratios, we presented test stimuli with different luminance contrasts: 0.5%, 2%, 8%, and 32%.

Hit\u00a0modulation was explained to a small but significant extent by neuronal identity [R<sup>2</sup>=0.059; p&lt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e,f</a>], and to a larger extent by population fluctuations across trials [R<sup>2</sup>=0.248; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>(III)] or both processes together [R<sup>2</sup>=0.281; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>(IV)]. The number of consistently hit-modulated neurons (which could be either up- or downregulated) was significantly above\u00a0chance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>; p&lt;0.05). This pattern was robust over animals as hit\u00a0modulations could be explained with above-chance accuracy by neuron identity, population fluctuations, or both in 7/8, 8/8, and 8/8 animals, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>). The fraction of significantly hit-modulated neurons was above\u00a0chance (at p&lt;0.05) for 7/8 animals. Although significant for most subjects, the variance explained by the consistency of neuronal responses was fairly low (always R<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.1), and even the combination of trial-by-trial population fluctuations and neuronal identity never exceeded R<sup>2</sup>=0.35. This could indicate either that detection-related neural correlates in V1 are minor or that a simple enhancement of mean activity is an index ill-suited to describe potentially strong, but more complex changes in neuronal population dynamics. In particular, we hypothesized that correlates of stimulus detection may be unfolding by multineuron interactions at the single trial level and rely on the relative contrast in activation between neurons."

However, such metrics are rarely studied in the context of behavioral relevance, and in the few cases where they are, their ability to predict behavior appeared modest (<a href=\"#bib29\">Froudarakis et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, we developed an alternative measure of population heterogeneity that aims to capture the spread in normalized population activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a>; see also \u2018Materials and methods\u2019): by subtracting the z-scored response (each trial being a single data point per neuron, see <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>) of each neuron from that of all other neurons in that same trial, we obtained a \u0394z-score matrix where high values indicate high pairwise dissimilarity in neuronal activation. Taking the mean over all pairwise \u0394z-scores provides a measure of population heterogeneity that can in theory be computed over an arbitrarily small time interval (but note that for all analyses, except those shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, we used a single trial as time unit). This way, similarly strongly activated as well as similarly weakly activated pairs of neurons will decrease heterogeneity. By contrast, dissimilarly activated neuronal pairs (i.e. one strong, one weak) will increase it. Therefore, population heterogeneity incorporates both trial-by-trial fluctuations and intra-population differences in a neuronal pairwise manner. Its dependence on z-scored activity means that a neuron\u2019s contribution to heterogeneity is scaled to its relative level of activation\u2014and because highly active neurons are often highly variable (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baddeley et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Montijn et al., 2014</a>) also to its signal-to-noise ratio."

The two panels below show a live updated summary of mean dF/F<sub>0</sub> (left) and heterogeneity (right) during each trial. Green indicates a licking response, and red indicates no response. The two lower panels show a live trace of mean population dF/F<sub>0</sub> and heterogeneity. Licking responses are shown as red dotted lines, and stimulus presentations are shown as a gray shaded area. Note that the recording is very stable, except during periods of heavy licking, such as after hit responses, when reward is delivered. Also note that neural data acquired during licking are not used for any of our analyses and do, therefore, not influence our results. The mouse is licking vigorously during the initial period of the recording, but more typical behavior sets in less than 2 min after start of the recording. Near the end of the video, it can be seen that hits and misses are more easily separable using heterogeneity than dF/F<sub>0</sub> (although this difference is stronger in the example video than in the entire data set as a whole)."

Behavioral reaction time is often used as a proxy for salience, attention, and readiness (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beck et al., 2008</a>), so we hypothesized that similar dissociations for fast/slow responses may be found as for hit/miss trials. We performed linear regressions per animal for dF/F<sub>0</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) and heterogeneity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>) as a function of reaction time. Similarly to hit/miss differences, the preferred population dF/F<sub>0</sub> was not significantly associated with behavioral performance (regression slopes vs. 0, FDR-corrected one-sample t-test, n.s.), nor were preferred population z-scored activity, variance, sparseness, instantaneous Pearson-like correlations (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), whole-population (raw and z-scored) dF/F<sub>0</sub>, and sliding-window based correlations (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Based on our current observations, this led us to hypothesize that a high heterogeneity in V1 populations reflects a brain state conducive to stimulus detection. If correct, heterogeneity immediately prior to stimulus presentation should be predictive of reaction time. To test this, we split all hit trials into the slowest 50% and fastest 50% per contrast (e.g. see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013d</a>) and calculated a measure of predictability of slow versus fast responses based on the 3 s preceding stimulus presentation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using pre-stimulus-onset heterogeneity, fast response trials were highly predictable (FDR-corrected one-sample t-tests, p&lt;0.01), while slow versus miss trials were not (p=0.799). Behavioral responses were not predictable based on population dF/F<sub>0</sub> (slow-miss, p=0.157; slow-fast, p=0.811; fast-miss, p=0.924), and the difference in predictability between heterogeneity and dF/F<sub>0</sub> was significant for slow-fast (p&lt;0.01) and fast-miss (p&lt;0.05), but not for slow-miss (p=0.477) trials."

For direct quantification, our current data set is unfortunately insufficiently large. Therefore, in order to estimate multidimensional symmetry around the main diagonal, we decided to study the effect of mirroring points across this diagonal. First, we calculated the distribution of pairwise inter-point distances in neural response space without mirroring (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7e</a>). In this case, each point again represents the population response during a single trial. The data show that the inter-point distance was slightly, but significantly larger for hit than miss trials (paired t-test, p&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7f</a>). This indicates that population responses during hits encompass a larger volume of neural response space than during misses, which will increase heterogeneity values and allows more information to be encoded with the same number of neurons."

If the population responses are distributed asymmetrically around the diagonal, then mirroring will increase the pairwise distance, while if they are distributed symmetrically no change should be observed. There was a small but significant increase in inter-point distance for both hits and misses, and mirroring increased the inter-point distance more for hits than misses (p&lt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7f</a>, inset). Although the effect sizes are small, they are significant, and we can therefore\u2014at least based on this analysis\u2014not (yet) conclude that heterogeneity is more than an epiphenomenon. In fact, the difference between hits and misses suggests that population responses during hit trials are more asymmetrical (i.e. more clustered in discrete states of neural activity) than during miss trials (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7f</a>, inset). Considering that inter-trial population pattern consistencies were lower during miss trials (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we can conclude that neuronal populations during miss trials show more random behavior within a limited neural space, while neuronal populations during hit trials show more structured behavior in a more extended neural space."

To test the effect of these removals on hit/miss differences, we performed a decoding procedure of hit versus miss trials (i.e. we decoded the animal\u2019s response) on the original data, and on data with the mean, the heterogeneity or both aspects removed. The results show no difference between the original data and the mean-removed data, but removing heterogeneity (or both heterogeneity and the mean) led to a small but significant decrease in decoding performance (heterogeneity-removed vs. original data, p&lt;0.05; heterogeneity-removed vs. mean-removed, p&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7h</a>).

While neural response heterogeneity may be an important factor and useful metric for its strong correlation with especially reaction times, further research is required to discover which other neural properties may be important for visual stimulus detection."

Using a novel measure of population heterogeneity, we show that the differentiation in activation within these populations predicts visual detection, and particularly behavioral reaction time, and is associated with an increased accuracy of stimulus presence and feature representation by the population (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). High heterogeneity prior to stimuli correlated with fast hit responses, but also showed a dissociation between detection and nondetection behavior, indicating that detection-related population activity may be gated by arousal mechanisms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Neuronal population activation patterns are more similar during accurate task performance upon repetition of the same stimulus, but not when the animal fails to respond, suggesting that specific population patterns may recur when the animal is well engaged in the task (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that neural processing of information related to detection behavior depends on transient differentiation in neuronal activity within cortical populations rather than on temporally stable ensembles or on gain\u00a0modulation of population activity as a whole (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

However, in principle, the observed differences could be subject to a number of confounds that might limit their interpretability. First, the relatively mild water restriction led to a behavioral performance at the 100% probe trials that is lower compared to other studies using similar tasks (<a href=\"#bib30\">Glickfeld et al., 2013</a>). This could mean that the observed differences in heterogeneity between hit and miss trials are due to changes in motivation rather than visual detection. If this were the case, however, hit\u2013miss differences should be as large during 100% probe trials as during test contrast trials. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1f</a>,<a href=\"#fig3s1\">2</a> shows that this is not the case; during intermediate test contrasts (2% and 8%), the hit\u2013miss difference in heterogeneity is largest. A similar reasoning applies to 0% contrast probe trials, where a heterogeneity difference between (false alarm) responses and correct rejections was lacking, which strongly argues against heterogeneity being due to response emissions per se. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the neural correlates of behavioral responses as reported in this study are due to differences in motivation. Given this caveat on suboptimal performance, one may predict that a better behavioral performance would have only increased the hit\u2013miss effect sizes we report in this study."

Previous research has shown that extensive differences exist between superficial and deep layers: whereas L2/3 neurons often show relatively low peak firing rates and sparse responses to sensory stimulation, L5 neurons show denser response patterns with on average higher peak firing rates (<a href=\"#bib22\">De Kock and Sakmann, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</a>). In somatosensory cortex, it has been shown that hits and correct rejections in a go-no-go object localization task can be better separated using mean spiking rates in L5 than in L2/3 (<a href=\"#bib58\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>). Our result that L2/3 populations show only a small differentiation between hit and miss responses in mean activation should therefore not be taken as proof for a canonical principle also applicable to other cortical layers. Future validation of our results in deep layers is necessary for a decisive answer whether our results are indeed applicable to different layers of primary sensory cortex."

Our observation that stimulus features are represented more accurately (as quantified by decoding accuracy) during hit than miss trials may therefore be somewhat surprising (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). This suggests that mechanisms that increase the likelihood of stimulus detection may be acting through a general enhancement of stimulus processing intensity, corroborating previous research in monkey showing that attention can lead to horizontal shifts in contrast response curves, as if the stimulus were of higher contrast (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Trujillo and Treue, 2002</a>). It is interesting to ask whether our results on heterogeneity can be cast in terms of dynamic range effects. Neurons are expected to climb in this dynamic range when visual contrast increases, which is confirmed by the rise in dF/F<sub>0</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). However, if heterogeneity would be primarily determined by neurons being able to operate along the steep slope of their dynamic range, then the large difference in heterogeneity between hits and misses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>) along the test contrasts (0.5\u201332%) would not be expected."

Although in our analysis sparseness and variance explained more behavioral variability in reaction time than (z-scored) mean population activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>), these measures perform much worse than heterogeneity and the spread of instantaneous Pearson-like correlations. Possibly, a sample of ~60\u201370 tuned neurons is insufficient to estimate instantaneous sparseness accurately. An alternative explanation for this poor correlation could be that sparseness of L2/3 populations results from anatomical wiring required for efficient stimulus coding and to enable locally selective synaptic plasticity without immediately changing the coding of stimulus features within the population response (<a href=\"#bib65\">Rao and Ballard, 1999</a>). Correlates of visual detection that depend on accurate stimulus feature representation might then be better captured by a maximization of Mahalanobis distances in neural activity between pairs of neurons within this already sparse network. This latter interpretation is in line with the data we recorded and suggests that sparse stimulus representation by L2/3 neurons reflects a structural optimization of the population code to represent stimulus features, while heterogeneity captures more temporally dynamic modulations related to perception."

Without such neuromodulators, neurons within the same preferred population would randomly participate in representing the current stimulus. This interpretation is compatible with previous work; for instance, ACh has been observed to influence burst spiking, membrane potential fluctuations, cortical oscillations, and desynchronization. These processes have been implicated in modulating competitive inhibition effects within neuronal populations and may very well influence the consistency of specific neuronal subnetworks being activated (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borgers et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fries, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bosman et al., 2014</a>).

During the first five days of training, we conditioned licking in response to visual stimulation by pairing passive stimulation with reward delivery (~9 \u00b5l of water with 15% sucrose with 1% vanilla extract) (stage 1). After the conditioning phase, visual stimuli (100% contrast drifting gratings as described in the previous paragraph) were presented indefinitely until mice made a licking response that was monitored using a custom-built infrared LED-based lick detector. When animals made a response, the visual stimulus presentation terminated and reward was available for 5 s. This shaping phase (stage 2) lasted for a maximum of 5 days or less if the animals were often making clear lick responses. After this ~2-week initial phase, we started training the animals on a simple version of the final task (stage 3); maximum stimulus presentation was reduced to 5 s and subsequent trials would only start if the mice did not make any lick responses for at least a random interval of 1\u20133 s. During this stage, reward size was gradually reduced to ~3 \u00b5l per trial. When animals would consistently perform at least 80 trials within a period of 45 min, they would be moved to the next stage. In stage 4, we introduced 0% contrast probe trials to monitor the behavioral performance of animals by testing for false-alarm responses and calculating if they showed statistically significant above-chance performance. In this stage, we also lengthened the inter-trial interval to any random duration between 6 and 8 s. Once mice attained a sufficient ratio of hit/miss trials, we moved them to training stage 5, where we increased the inter-trial interval to 10\u201312 seconds and presented mild air puffs as a negative reinforcer whenever mice would lick outside the stimulus presentation or reward delivery period. At this stage, animals were required to not lick for a random interval of 1\u20133 s in order to gain access to the next stimulus presentation. Stage 5 lasted until the mice had been trained for 8\u201310 weeks in total. Finally, if mice performed consistently and significantly above chance during stage 5 (n = 12 / 21 animals), then in the 2-week period preceding the imaging experiment mice were trained on the microscope setup, and our setup\u2019s resonant mirrors were activated to produce the characteristic 8000 Hz sound that would also be present during calcium imaging. In this final stage, all possible efforts were made to simulate surroundings of the eventual calcium imaging experiment as closely as possible to habituate the mice to the two-photon laser lab\u2019s environment. Mice were always allowed to take up to 3 s after stimulus onset to respond and were thus not explicitly trained to make fast behavioral responses."

We used an in vivo two-photon laser scanning microscopy setup (modified Leica SP5 confocal system) with a Spectra-Physics Mai-Tai HP laser set at a wavelength of 810 nm to simultaneously excite OGB and SR101 molecules, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib53\">Montijn et al., 2014</a>) in cortical layer 2/3 at depths from the pia mater ranging from 140 to 170 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). During data acquisition, mice were performing a go/no-go stimulus detection task where the animals had to lick whenever a visual stimulus was presented. Stimulus parameters were equal to those described above. We varied the contrast of the drifting grating (0%, 0.5%, 2%, 8%, 32%, and 100%) to elicit a wide range of hit/miss ratios. Responses to 0% contrast probe trials were not rewarded, but responses to all other contrasts were. We did not explicitly aim for very high detection performance (high hit rates and low miss rates) to avoid overtraining and associated habitual or automated responding (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998</a>). A complete set of visual stimuli, therefore, consisted of 48 trials (6 contrasts times 8 directions). The order of presentation of these 48 trials was randomized independently for each repetition block. After the experiment was completed, we tested for statistically significant stimulus detection performance by calculating the binomial 2.5th\u201397.5th percentile intervals (henceforth 95% CI) of response proportion to the two probe trial types\u2014100% and 0% contrast stimuli\u2014using the CP method. Of the 10 animals from which we recorded calcium imaging data during task performance, one was rejected because of excessive variability in responses due to brain movement and one was rejected due to insufficient discriminability between the two types of probe trials (overlapping CIs). All data we present in this paper are from the remaining eight animals. The number of repetitions per stimulus type (unique orientation x contrast) ranged from 6 to 16. For most analyses, we took the mean over all orientations (n=4), so each contrast was presented 24\u201364 times. For all analyses of single-animal data, each trial was taken as a single data point, where its value was the mean dF/F<sub>0</sub> over all recorded frames during stimulus presentation (which was dependent on the reaction time of the mouse). To avoid the confound of having higher signal-to-noise ratios for miss than hit trials due to longer data acquisition, within each contrast group we randomly assigned to all miss trials a duration randomly selected from the reaction time distribution of hit trials."

This decoder was based on a previously published maximum-likelihood-naive Bayes decoding algorithm (for a more complete description, see <a href=\"#bib53\">Montijn et al., 2014</a>). For each neuron and stimulus orientation, we computed the mean and standard deviation of mean dF/F<sub>0</sub> during presentation of a 100% contrast stimulus as well as the mean and standard deviation during 0% probe trials. For each test trial and neuron with the preferred orientation as the trial\u2019s stimulus orientation, we calculated the probability a stimulus was present by reading out the likelihood density function for 0% and 100% contrast trials. The product over neurons in the preferred population for each trial then yields a population posterior probability value for stimulus absence (0% likelihood) and presence (100% likelihood). The decoder\u2019s read-out was the posterior with the highest probability. Because the likelihood was only based on 0% and 100% contrast responses, automatic cross-validation was ensured for decoding test contrast stimuli. After decoding stimulus presence for all trials, we split the trials into hits and misses and calculated the percentage for which the decoder indicated a stimulus was present per response type and contrast, averaging over repetitions and orientations. This yielded two curves per animal (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). We tested for statistically significant differences between response and no-response trials by performing a paired t-test over animals on the intermediate contrasts (0.5\u201332%)."

We again separated fast, slow, and miss trials, and for each stimulus orientation calculated the correlation of the dF/F<sub>0</sub> response vector between pairs of trials with the same type of behavioral response (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). We separated the neuronal responses for that orientation\u2019s preferred and nonpreferred population of neurons, also to address whether consistency across trials might be restricted to the preferred population or would also occur in the nonpreferred population (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d\u2013d</a>). Note that because we calculated the correlations separately for preferred and nonpreferred populations, the relative contribution of the orientation signal is fairly low, which explains the relatively low correlation values. To assess above-chance similarities, we compared these values to correlations obtained from shuffled data. By shuffling within each stimulus orientation all trial identities randomly for each neuron, the orientation signal is preserved, but other similarities across trials are destroyed. We repeated this shuffling procedure 100 iterations and took the mean of these 100 iterations as shuffled correlation value per animal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b\u2013d</a>). To test for statistically significant consistencies in population activation patterns, we performed FDR-corrected paired t-tests between the real and shuffled correlation values over animals for the different response types and the two neuronal population types.

Although this definition is computationally different from our pairwise definition of heterogeneity, it also captures the overall dissimilarity of responses within a population of neurons.

This also seems unlikely; because 0% contrast probe trials did not induce neuronal activity during false alarms (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>, green line). Theoretically, however, such signals could still be present and influence population activity only when occurring concurrently with visual stimulation. To control for this, we re-performed our analyses shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>, but now used data only from the first 0.4\u00a0s after stimulus onset; approximately 0.8\u00a0s before the mean reaction time. Leaving a window of 0.8\u00a0s between the latest frame included in the data analysis and the licking response should also eliminate potential modulatory activity from motor cortex related to the preparation of licking. The results from this control analysis were slightly noisier due to the shorter data acquisition duration per trial, but showed no qualitative differences to the original analysis regarding heterogeneity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1i,j</a>). The intermediate contrasts still showed significant enhancements in heterogeneity (p&lt;0.01) during hit trials, but we found no significant differences for mean population dF/F<sub>0</sub> (p=0.543). We, therefore, conclude that our results regarding heterogeneity are not confounded by motor-related modulations due to running or licking, nor by reward-expectation prior to licking responses, and confirm that the mean population dF/F<sub>0</sub> is not or less useful as a measure of neural correlates of perception."

We defined all combinations of orientations and contrasts as different stimulus types, yielding a total of 21 different stimulus types (four orientations times five contrasts plus probe trials).

We used a similar leave-one-out cross-validated naive Bayes decoder as described above for fast, slow, and miss trials, and calculated per trial the relative likelihood that the subsequent stimulus presentation would lead to a miss, fast, or slow response. We then split the predictive decoding results per actual behavioral response group and averaged the relative prediction likelihood per animal. This yields three relative probability values per actual response type per animal. Assigning an angle to each of these behavioral responses that are separated by 2/3\u03c0 on the unit circle and taking the relative likelihood as the vector magnitude, it is then possible to calculate a resultant prediction vector per actual response type per animal. To quantify statistical significance, we multiplied an angle-based correctness index (+1 when the resultant prediction vector angle is perfectly aligned to the actual response angle and \u20131 when they are separated by 1\u03c0) with the vector magnitude, giving a normalized decoding accuracy index between \u20131.0 and +1.0, where chance level is 0. Lastly, we performed one-sample t-tests on the normalized decoding accuracy indices over animals and response types for heterogeneity and dF/F<sub>0</sub>, and a paired t-test between dF/F<sub>0</sub> and heterogeneity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In this paper, Montijn and collaborators compared neuronal fluorescence signals from L2/3 mouse V1 with behavioral responses in a detection visual task. The reviewers think that there are interesting results but it is not clear up to what point the observed correlation between behavior and the heterogeneity measure supports the authors' claim. An important issue is that authors neglect many previous developments on the neuronal correlates in other early primary cortical areas (somatosensory cortex and auditory cortex). The paper focuses on the neuronal correlates of V1 with visual detection performance, but this is a general problem and the authors should mention this."

This practice is extremely dubious. First, it is totally unclear how it affects subsequent analysis. Were Z-scores calculated once over all orientations or calculated for separately each orientation for those neurons that preferred it? When examining the relationship between behavior and heterogeneity, was a correlation calculated for each orientation or over all orientations?"

In essence, this becomes a matter of responding to a change in light level. Thus analyzing responses to oriented stimuli may result in a bias towards those neurons with inherent responses to the stimuli which obscures or masks the responses from the neurons actually involved in the discrimination of the change in intensity. Nonetheless, the authors, on the basis of Ca<sup>2</sup> -transient measurements from ~100 L2 neurons in monocular V1, conclude that \"visual perception does not correlate well with mean response strength, but is significantly correlated with population heterogeneity.\" This statement ought to be drastically revised to reflect that it is contingent on the ad-hoc procedures chosen by the authors, and how the correlation is calculated using data-selection procedures based on orientation, which was not part of the behavioral task."

If one were designing an experiment to test for a correlation between mean response strength and visual perception, surely it would be wise to do one's best to ensure that the neurons from which responses were recorded had response properties that were at least to some degree related to the discrimination target? While it would be equally unwise to assume that orientation selective neurons in V1 do not play a role in visual discriminations not involving oriented stimuli at their preferred orientation, the failure on the authors' side to discuss in any way the caveats associated with their experimental design and simultaneously to draw the conclusions that they do and state them as strongly as they do is remarkable."

For example, if all neurons respond to a given stimulus with the same fluorescence increase, the heterogeneity of that stimulus will not be zero but will depend on their responses to other stimuli. Even a trial that elicits no fluorescence change in any neuron the heterogeneity will not be zero. Since the measure is based on z-scores, it will amplify fluorescence noise in neurons that are less frequently active so that for sparse activity noise can dominate the measure, but this issue is never discussed. While it does indeed seem to correlate better than some other measures with behavior, the manuscript does not adequately explain how this measure was calculated and in any case this measure would not tell us what is going on the brain."

The mean population response is only one particular projection of the population activity (let's say, described by the vector [1 1 \u2026 1]). If detecting the stimulus activates the neural population in any other direction in neural space, this measure of heterogeneity will increase (because some neurons increase activity while others decrease).

His concern is that, if this is the case, it is not heterogeneity per se that is relevant, but the presence of complex population patterns of activity that are not visible at the level of the mean response.

The reviewer\u2019s issue therefore comes down to whether z-scoring of neuronal responses is an acceptable practice. As the ability to separate two classes (which can also be the absence and presence of a stimulus) depends on the relative distance in standard deviations between the two distributions representing the responses to their respective stimulus conditions, z-scoring is a natural and widely used way to study information content in neuronal spike trains. As the reviewer noted, this indeed changes neuronal output properties at face value, because it is a non-linear transformation. For sparsely active neurons it will enhance the relative variability in z-score values for trials where the neuron shows low activity, but it will also similarly enhance the relative neural response when the neuron is in fact active. As highly active neurons (i.e. non-sparsely responding) are likely to also be highly variable (i.e. neurons generally have Fano factors higher than one), neural signals can often be better separated using normalized neuronal activity rather than absolute spiking rates or calcium fluorescence dF/F0 (Baddeley et al. 1997 as cited (subsection \u201cResponse dissimilarity within neuronal populations correlates with detection\u201d, third paragraph); Montijn, Vinck, and Pennartz 2014). We agree with the reviewer that neuronal response variability and normalization procedures thereof are important and interesting topics to discuss, but we believe this is beyond the scope of our current manuscript (also considering the already substantial size of the manuscript). We trust that the clarifications of the heterogeneity calculation in combination with the additional analyses in the revised manuscript (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) will sufficiently address the reviewer\u2019s concerns and better explain how to interpret heterogeneity, and its relevance for the brain."

Mice placed on Styrofoam balls tend to run spontaneously because they are placed on a non-level surface, while all of our animals were trained for several months on a level-surface treadmill.

Within-frame image warping depends directly on the frame acquisition speed, because for low acquisition speeds there is more time for spatial movements in the brain to distort the image. As acquisition speed increases, brain tissue movement leads to displacement between frames rather than warping within frames. Such between-frame image displacement can still greatly influence data quality if left uncorrected, but these movements can be corrected using affine x-y registration algorithms, as we have done in our study (see our response to the previous comment for issues related to z-shifts and potential fidgeting behavior). We would also like to note that Greenberg and Kerr performed experiments on rats, where the dura was removed, which probably leads to significantly larger motion artifacts than in a mouse brain with intact dura. Still, these arguments provide only circumstantial proof that our data would show fewer and less strong motion artifacts. Therefore, to test for contamination by running-induced artifacts, we performed control analyses where we removed all trials during which the animals were running and found that this did not influence our results (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1g\u2013h</a>). Therefore the within-frame image warping artifacts the reviewer mentions are unlikely to influence our data to a significant degree (see also <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

We presented drifting gratings of 8 different directions to the mice, and thus they were spaced around the unit circle in steps of 45 degrees.

In any case, this potential confound would not influence our main result (the hit/miss and RT prediction of heterogeneity), because this does not depend on analyzing different orientations separately. Potential ocular torsion effects would influence our analyses based on explicit differential treatment of stimulus orientations (for example, the difference between preferred and non-preferred populations in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e,f</a>, and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), where its effect would not be to totally invalidate them, but to inject some extra noise into the results.

In summary, in order to study multidimensional aspects of population responses and their relation to heterogeneity, we had to develop an alternative definition of multidimensional heterogeneity. We argue that within a multidimensional neural response space (where each neuron represents a single dimension), heterogeneity within a population response corresponds to the distance from this response to the main diagonal, which represents the gradient along which the mean of the response changes. Here, the mean and heterogeneity are two complementary features of population responses with gradients in orthogonal directions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We studied whether population responses were distributed symmetrically around the main diagonal (i.e. no complex multidimensional patterns are present, other than captured by heterogeneity) or rather asymmetrically, which would show that heterogeneity is most likely an epiphenomenon. Population responses showed a modest, but significant asymmetry, for hit as well as miss trials, but interestingly hits were more asymmetrically distributed than misses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7f</a>). We provide further analyses where we removed either the mean or the heterogeneity of population responses (but preserved all other response structures) and quantify the effect of their removal on decoding the animal\u2019s behavioral response. Removal of the mean had little effect, but removal of heterogeneity significantly impaired decoding performance (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7g,h</a>). We thus can confirm that heterogeneity is an important factor that is contributing more to the differentiation between detected and non-detected stimuli than the mean of the population response, but that other, more complex population response properties contribute even more to the detection of visual stimuli than heterogeneity. We describe these results in more detail in the revised manuscript (subsection \u201cAnalysis of heterogeneity in multidimensional space\u201d)."

Moreover, we performed an additional control analysis where we shuffled trials randomly across neurons, but kept the stimulus types intact. This way, we kept the stimulus response properties the same for each individual neuron, but destroyed temporal inter- relations between the activity of neurons.

I do not see the relationship between the author's response to my question and the question. Why is it reasonably assumed that L2/3 is involved in the task that is presented?</i> We agree with the reviewer, as we also stated in our initial reply, that we cannot claim to have shown causal involvement of V1 L2/3 neurons in detecting stimuli. In our manuscript we therefore only discuss our results in terms of correlation, rather than causation. However, the results presented by Glickfeld and colleagues also show that their effects of optogenetic stimulation were stronger for superficial than deep layers (reduction of firing rate: -66.7% for units in superficial layers, vs. -33.9% for units in deep layers), as the channelrhodopsin-exciting blue light was shone unto the cortical surface and was therefore less intense when it reached deeper layers. Arguably, the reduction in behavioral performance could therefore be due mostly to the stronger neural effect in superficial layers. This is of course hypothetical, as Glickfeld et al. did not explicitly quantify the dependence of their behavioral effect on the reduction in firing rate in superficial vs. deep layers. However, we believe that correlational rather than causational research is still valuable in itself, as it may provide new insights and ideas on how the visual cortex could be involved in the detection of visual stimuli. Moreover, it has been reported that superficial layers (L2/3) in visual cortex correlate with the perception of visual stimuli (e.g. Ito and Gilbert 1999; van der Togt et al., 2006). In summary, although there is no proof yet for the causal involvement of L2/3 in visual detection, we believe these considerations offer sufficient justification for examining L2/3 population behavior.
