Here we characterize the role of <i>Ddb1</i>, a component of the CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex. <i>Ddb1</i> is highly expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and its deletion leads to abrogation of both adult and fetal hematopoiesis, targeting specifically transiently amplifying progenitor subsets. However, <i>Ddb1</i> deletion in non-dividing lymphocytes has no discernible phenotypes. <i>Ddb1</i> silencing activates Trp53 pathway and leads to significant effects on cell cycle progression and rapid apoptosis. The abrogation of hematopoietic progenitor cells can be partially rescued by simultaneous deletion of Trp53. Conversely, depletion of DDB1 in embryonic stem cell (ESC) leads to differentiation albeit negative effects on cell cycle and apoptosis. Mass spectrometry reveals differing protein interactions between DDB1 and distinct DCAFs, the substrate recognizing components of the E3 complex, between cell types. Our studies identify CUL4-DDB1 complex as a novel post-translational regulator of stem and progenitor maintenance and differentiation."

Here we characterize the role of <i>Ddb1</i>, a component of the CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex. <i>Ddb1</i> is highly expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and its deletion leads to abrogation of both adult and fetal hematopoiesis, targeting specifically transiently amplifying progenitor subsets. However, <i>Ddb1</i> deletion in non-dividing lymphocytes has no discernible phenotypes. <i>Ddb1</i> silencing activates Trp53 pathway and leads to significant effects on cell cycle progression and rapid apoptosis. The abrogation of hematopoietic progenitor cells can be partially rescued by simultaneous deletion of Trp53. Conversely, depletion of DDB1 in embryonic stem cell (ESC) leads to differentiation albeit negative effects on cell cycle and apoptosis. Mass spectrometry reveals differing protein interactions between DDB1 and distinct DCAFs, the substrate recognizing components of the E3 complex, between cell types. Our studies identify CUL4-DDB1 complex as a novel post-translational regulator of stem and progenitor maintenance and differentiation."

When a stem cell divides in two, it typically produces another stem cell and a cell that goes on to differentiate. Hematopoietic stem cells (or HSCs) are found in the bone marrow and give rise to all blood cells throughout the life of an organism. It is therefore crucial that they divide correctly to maintain the balance between renewing their numbers and making new types of cells."

Recent research suggested that the cell\u2019s \u201cubiquitin-proteasome system\u201d might be important for regulating stem cell division. This system rapidly degrades proteins, thereby regulating protein abundance in cells. Enzymes known as E3 ligases form part of this system, and recognize proteins to be marked for destruction with a small protein tag."

Further experiments revealed that genetically engineered mice that lack DDB1 in their population of blood cells die soon after they are born and have fewer blood cells. Gao et al. next inhibited the production of DDB1 in adult mice. This stopped the adult mice\u2019s hematopoietic stem cells from dividing, and the mice died because their bone marrow couldn\u2019t produce new blood cells. These results show that DDB1 is necessary for stem cells to renew their numbers and differentiate into blood cells in both developing and adult animals."

In the case of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) they are rare and specialized cells, which are able to give rise to all blood lineages. The balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation needs to be tightly regulated in order to keep the HSC pool size as well as to constantly replenish mature blood cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Orkin and Zon, 2008</a>).

The ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation system (UPS) is a primary mechanism that controls protein turnover and activation. UPS acts via three sequential enzymes: an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (<a href=\"#bib12\">Crusio et al., 2010</a>). Among these three enzymes, E3 ubiquitin ligases confer substrate specificity. An E3 ubiquitin ligase is a multi-subunit complex that recognizes and binds specific target proteins via substrate recognizing subunits. In HSCs, it has been shown that <i>Fbw7</i>, an E3 ubiquitin ligase member, governs quiescence of HSCs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Matsuoka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Thompson et al., 2008</a>). <i>Itch</i> and <i>c-Cbl</i>, other two E3 ubiquitin ligases, have been reported to negatively regulate HSC homeostasis and function (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rathinam et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rathinam et al., 2011</a>). In other stem cell systems, it has been shown that <i>Huwe1</i>, a HECT domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulates proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells as well as embryonic stem cells (ESC) (<a href=\"#bib13\">D'Arca et al., 2010</a>). Protein levels of OCT4 and NANOG, transcription factors required for pluripotency, are modulated in an ubiquitin-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib48\">Xu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ramakrishna et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buckley et al., 2012</a>), suggesting key roles of E3 ligase complexes for ESC differentiation.

DDB1 heterodimerizes with DDB2 and shows high affinity for UV-induced DNA damage sites (<a href=\"#bib4\">Batty et al., 2000</a>). Once bound to a damaged site, the CUL4-DDB1 complex ubiquitinates DDB2 and targets it for degradation, facilitating subsequent repair events (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sugasawa et al., 2005</a>). The CUL4-DDB1ligase is a multi-component complex. Through its C-terminus, CUL4A or CUL4B binds to the RING finger protein to interact with the E2 conjugating enzyme. On its N-terminus, CUL4A or CUL4B binds to DDB1 to recruit CUL4-DDB1\u00a0associated factors (DCAF), a family of WD40 repeat proteins which confer substrate specificity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Angers et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Higa et al., 2006</a>). The CUL4-DDB1 ligase has been shown to target several substrates for ubiquitin dependent degradation. The list of substrates include the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Higa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al., 2004</a>), the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bondar et al., 2006</a>) and Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nishitani et al., 2008</a>), the histone methyltransferase PR-Set7 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oda et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tardat et al., 2010</a>), and Epe1, a JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase in fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braun et al., 2011</a>). More recently it has been found that the CUL4-DDB1 complex can be modulated by binding of the drug, lenalidomide leading to degradation of lymphoid transcription factors IKZF1 and IKF3 in multiple myeloma cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fischer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kronke et al., 2014</a>). These findings suggest that the CUL4-DDB1 ligase complex has numerous substrates that it affects a variety of cellular functions, and that the complex can be altered with targeted therapeutics. Intriguingly, germline <i>Cul4a</i> deleted mice are viable and display no gross abnormality (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2009</a>), possibly due to redundancy with <i>Cul4b</i>, whereas <i>Ddb1</i> deletion is embryonic lethal and embryos are not seen past E12.5 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cang et al., 2006</a>). Conditional inactivation of <i>Cul4a</i> in the skin leads to resistance to UV-induced skin carcinogenesis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). Specific deletion of <i>Ddb1</i> in brain results in elimination of neuronal progenitor cells, hemorrhages in brain, and neonatal lethality (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cang et al., 2006</a>). DDB1 also plays a role in ESC self-renewal, and silencing of <i>Ddb1</i> led ESC to differentiate (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buckley et al., 2012</a>)."

Efficient deletion of Ddb1 in bone marrow was confirmed by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). <i>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Vav1Cre<sup>+</sup></i> mice were born at normal frequencies and were indistinguishable from littermates.

Peripheral blood analysis at day 7 showed that <i>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Vav1Cre<sup>+</sup></i> mice had significantly decreased counts of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets compared to littermates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c,d</a>). Moreover, the cellularity and size of thymus and spleen were significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e,f</a>).

In <i>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Mx1Cre<sup>+</sup></i>mice, <i>Ddb1</i> was deleted in hematopoietic compartment of adult mice by injecting polyinosine-polycytidine (polyI:C) to induce interferon \u03b1 response. The floxed allele of <i>Ddb1</i> was recombined efficiently after polyI:C injection in all hematopoietic tissues including the bone marrow (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). As a result, the Ddb1 protein was undetectable in polyI:C injected <i>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Mx1Cre<sup>+</sup></i> bone marrow (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Strikingly, all <i>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Mx1Cre<sup>+</sup></i> animals died within 3 weeks post <i>Ddb1</i> deletion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). To investigate the cause of the lethality, we analyzed <i>Ddb1</i> deficient mice 7 days after polyI:C injection. Peripheral blood counts showed that the <i>Ddb1</i> loss resulted in significant reduction in the total number of white blood cells and platelets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). No reduction was found in red blood cells, however enucleated red blood cells have a half-life of approximately 40 days suggesting DDB1 deficient mice succumb to hematopoietic failure prior to red blood cell turnover. <i>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Mx1Cre<sup>+</sup></i> bone marrow hypo-cellularity was evident from histological examination (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>), which was mostly accounted by cellularity decrease of myeloid lineage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f,g</a>). To understand the kinetics of <i>Ddb1</i> deletion effects, we analyzed HSC and progenitor cells at different time points after <i>Ddb1</i> deletion. cKit+ progenitors (both MP and LSK) were decreased in cell number at day 5 and further more at day 7 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h,i</a>).

It was found that the frequencies of LT-HSC, ST-HSC and MPP subsets were distorted upon <i>Ddb1</i> deletion, as there was a significant relative over-representation of LT-HSCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h</a>), similar to the findings in fetal hematopoiesis. In terms of cell number, MPPs, but not ST- and LT-HSCs, were decreased at day5, which was followed by the decrease of all HSPCs subsets at day7 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h</a>). This data suggest that <i>Ddb1</i> deletion has a greater impact on proliferative populations, in agreement to the expression analysis presented earlier. Together, these results demonstrate that the deletion of <i>Ddb1</i> leads to acute loss of proliferating HSPCs and their downstream progeny, resulting in bone marrow failure and lethality."

To this end, <i>Ddb1</i> was conditionally deleted in mature T cells using the <i>Cd4Cre<sup>+</sup></i> strain. In this mouse model, Cre recombinase expression initiates at the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>T-lymphocyte\u00a0stage of development, a population characterized by minimal cell proliferation. DDB1 was efficiently deleted at protein and mRNA levels in total thymocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a,b</a>). The residual <i>Ddb1</i> expression in total thymocytes could be attributed to the existence of DN cells in which the Cre recombinase was not expressed. We then examined T cell profiles in thymi and peripheral lymphoid tissue of <i>Ddb1<sup>F/F</sup>::Cd4Cre</i><sup>+</sup> mice. We found that these mice had normal thymocyte numbers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>), and normal CD4/CD8 cell profiles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>), confirming our hypothesis that <i>Ddb1</i> deletion in mature/resting T cells did not affect T cell development. To test this hypothesis further, we stimulated peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> cells using anti-CD3/CD28 treatment in vitro. When activated, the control T cells entered cell cycle, incorporated BrdU, an analogue of thymidine which is incorporated during DNA synthesis, and underwent several rounds of cell division as shown by the dilution of CFSE labeling. Strikingly, the DDB1 deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> cells failed to proliferate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>). Instead, more AnnexinV positive cells were found in the culture of DDB1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6f</a>), suggesting induction of cell death. Furthermore, we labeled anti-CD3/CD28 treated cells with EdU, an alternative of BrdU and easier for detection by immunoflourescence, and found that there were once more significantly fewer cells incorporating EdU when <i>Ddb1</i> was deleted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6g,h</a>), suggesting <i>Ddb1</i> deletion interferes with cell cycle progression. Combination of BrdU and DAPI labeling clearly showed that, when stimulated to proliferate, DDB1 deficient resting cells were unable to enter S phase of the cell cycle. Consistent with this result, the Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> protein, a potent CDK and cell cycle inhibitor, was accumulated in DDB1-deficient cells at the protein level, but not mRNA level (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6i,j</a>). When proteasome-dependent protein degradation was inhibited by MG132, Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> was significantly accumulated in control cells, however less protein accumulation following proteasome inhibition was seen in DDB1-deficient cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6i</a>), demonstrating that Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> degradation is dependent on DDB1 function. To prove direct interaction, Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> was co-immunoprecipitated with Cul4 and DDB1 complex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>), suggesting that Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> is indeed a substrate of Cul4a<sup>DDB1</sup>. In contrary, p27<sup>kip1</sup>, another cell cycle inhibitor and suggested DDB1 substrate (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bondar et al., 2006</a>), was not co-immuno-precipitated with the CUL4<sup>DDB1</sup> complex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). The above observation led us to test the hypothesis whether DDB1-deficiect phenotype in HSPCs can be restored by silencing Cdkn1a<sup>cip</sup>. To this end, <i>Cdkn1a<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice were crossed to <i>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Mx1Cre<sup>+</sup></i> and polyI:C was administered. We did not observe the restoration of stem or progenitor cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). Overall, these data demonstrate that DDB1 function is dispensable for resting T-lymphocyte homeostasis but becomes pivotal when cells enter S phase of the cell cycle."

ESC are highly proliferative and can differentiate into cell lineages of all three germ layers. We recently reported that pluripotency and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) are regulated at the post-translational level by the ubiquitin-proteasome systems (UPS). <i>Ddb1</i> was identified as one of the regulators essential for ESC self-renewal in a large interference RNA (siRNA) screen against USP members. Depletion of <i>Ddb1</i> resulted in loss of ESC self-renewal and pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buckley et al., 2012</a>). Here, we further validated the loss-of-function effects of <i>Ddb1</i> on ESC using two distinct shRNAs. Consistent with our previous findings, silencing <i>Ddb1</i> by shRNAs led to loss of ESC colony morphology (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>) and down-regulation of pluripotency factors <i>Nanog</i> and <i>Oct4</i>, and up-regulation of genes associated with mesoderm (<i>Meox1</i>), ectoderm (<i>Gfap</i>), and endoderm (<i>Sox17</i>) early differentiation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b,c</a>). However, we did not observe aberrant cell cycle or significant change in rates of apoptosis in these cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d,e</a>). Similar to ESC differentiated in the presence of retinoic acid, total Trp53 protein increased following silencing of <i>Ddb1</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). These data demonstrate that DDB1 is essential for ESC pluripotency and self-renewal without being accompanied by increased apoptosis or defects in cell cycle kinetics."

                                "text": "The different roles of DDB1 in distinct cell types suggested that cellular contexts are important for DDB1 function. One possibility is that the CUL4-DDB1 complex utilizes distinct DCAFs in different cells. To this end, we sought to identify DDB1-interacting proteins. We identified interacting proteins in three distinct cell types. The\u00a0different cell types expressed DDB1 protein at similar levels (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>). First, DDB1-interacting proteins were identified in ESC by targeting DDB1 in tandem with StrepII/Flag tags in the Col1A locus and generating a doxycycline-inducible ESC cell line (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b,d</a>). We also transiently expressed DDB1 in tandem with HA/Flag tags in 293T cells, and stably transduced DDB1 in tandem with Strep/Flag tags in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line capable of hematopoietic differentiation (HL60) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9c</a>). Interacting proteins were identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified 140 proteins in ESC, 110 proteins in 293T, and 128 in HL60 cells (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Interestingly very little overlap was found between subsets except CUL4A and proteins that make up the 26S proteasome. Another subset of proteins identified in ESC and 293T analyses were known proteins found in CUL4<sup>DDB1</sup> complexes (CUL4B, CUL4B, VprBP, DDA1) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10a,b</a>). Interaction of VprBP and DDB1 was validated in 293T cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10d</a>). One subset of proteins that was of importance was the DCAF proteins since they are the substrate recognizing proteins in the CUL4<sup>DDB1</sup> complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee and Zhou, 2007</a>). In ESC we identified DCAF11, DCAF15, DCAF4, DCAF8, whereas in the hematopoietic cell line HL60 only DCAF7 was identified suggesting that differing complexes between cell types maybe responsible for the loss of DDB1 phenotype in different cell types (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a,c</a>). To determine the DCAF proteins that responsible for the ESC DDB1-loss phenotype, we performed an RNAi screen targeting 15 known protein-members of the Cul4<sup>DDB1</sup> complex in ESC. Utilizing a reporter Nanog-GFP cell line as a marker of pluripotency we identified that of the DDB1-interacting DCAF proteins found in ESC silencing of DBA1, VprBP, and DCAF11 led to ESC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10e</a>). Furthermore, depletion of DDA1, VprBP, and DCAF11 led to down-regulation of transcripts associated with ESC pluripotency (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10g</a>) and lead to morphology changes consistent with differentiation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10f</a>). To determine if silencing of these DCAFs (DDA1, VprBP or DCAF11) in HSPC is also able to affect differentiation and/or maintenance, we transduced bone marrow-purified HSPC (LSK) cells with retroviruses expressing shRNAs against the selected DCAF genes. Interestingly, DDA1 silencing had no effect on colony formation in methylcellulose cultures, whereas a mild reduction in colonies was seen when VprBP was silenced. On the other hand, silencing of DCAF11 lead to a significant (greater than 50%) reduction in colony formation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10h</a>). shRNA silencing was confirmed to be greater than 60% with all shRNAs (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10i</a>). These findings are consistent with the levels of DCAF11 expression in both LSK and Lineage<sup>neg</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> HSPC (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10j</a>). These findings suggest that different phenotypes in ESC, HSPC, and T-lymphocytes could be attributed to distinct substrate recognition by DDB1-associated DCAFs."

Conditional ablation of <i>Ddb1</i> in adult and fetal HSPCs, using the Mx1Cre and Vav1Cre strains respectively, led to a complete loss of progenitors and stem cells, cytopenia, and acute lethality. Furthermore, increased levels of apoptosis and DNA damages were associated with acute <i>Ddb1</i> inactivation in HSPCs, suggesting that <i>Ddb1</i> regulates a wide range of cellular functions essential for the maintenance of hematopoiesis. Strikingly, inactivation of <i>Ddb1</i> in resting lymphocytes (using the CD4Cre strain) had no significant effects. Whereas, silencing DDB1 in embryonic stem cells leads to loss of pluripotency and self-renewal devoid of alterations in cell cycle or cell survival. These observations demonstrate that Ddb1 is essential for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in both HSPC and ESC. Previous studies demonstrate that the mechanism of CUL4-DDB1 differs depending on the cell type (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bondar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tardat et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kronke et al., 2014</a>). Our studies suggest that Ddb1 deletion affects hematopoietic progenitors by triggering DNA damage and Trp53 response, leading to the rapid induction of apoptosis. Knockdown of DDB1 in ESC by shRNA is not as efficient as Cre- mediated genetic deletion. However, the DDB1 knockdown clearly is sufficient to affect ES cell pluripotency and lead to differentiation (with no effects on apoptosis). At the same time, when DDB1 was silenced (by the same shRNAs) in 293T cells these cells underwent rapid apoptosis, even if the knockdown was not 100% (data not shown). Similarly, silencing of DDB1 in Lineage<sup>neg</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> progenitors also lead to cell death and absence of colony formation in CFU assays (data not shown). Additionally, deleting DDB1 in the early embryo is lethal, however the embryos survive till around E12.5 far past the point of the proliferation of the inner cell mass, suggesting proliferation and differentiation during early embryogenesis could be DDB1-independent (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cang et al., 2006</a>)."

It is one of the highest expressed genes in the multipotent progenitor (MPP) fraction, and is induced as the quiescent HSCs differentiate. It is expressed in all progenitor populations with the highest levels in progenitors of T cells. Several substrates of CUL4-DDB1 complex have been reported. Interestingly, it appears that there is tissue specificity for the various CUL4-DDB1 substrates. CDT1 and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> appear to be targeted by the complex in both brain and fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bondar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cang et al., 2006</a>). c-JUN and Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> are degraded by the CUL4-DDB1 complex in skin cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cang et al., 2007</a>). More recently, PR-set7, a methyltransferase regulating replication origins, was found to be also a substrate for the CUL4-DDB1 ligase (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tardat et al., 2010</a>). Ddb1 deletion resulted in accumulation of the Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup>, a CDK and cell cycle inhibitor, protein in bone marrow progenitor populations and T lymphocytes. On the other hand, we failed to demonstrate p27<sup>kip1</sup> stabilization in Ddb1-deleted hematopoietic cells (data not shown). Moreover, there was no detectable interaction between p27<sup>kip1</sup> and the CUL4-DDB1 complex. In addition, we failed to detect in <i>Ddb1</i>-deleted progenitor cells accumulation of CDT1, a licensing factor of DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al., 2004</a>), or PR-set7 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tardat et al., 2010</a>). However, co-silencing <i>Cdkn1a</i> with <i>Ddb1</i> did not rescue HSPC homeostasis, which suggests it is unlikely that DDB1 exerts its function solely by regulating Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> turnover in HSPC. Indeed DNA damage and acute induction of cell death were observed upon <i>Ddb1</i> deletion. Trp53 pathway silencing partially restored HSPC cell number in <i>Ddb1</i>-deleted animals. It is likely that DDB1 controls a broader spectrum of cellular functions, through its interaction with additional novel protein substrates and the proteasome itself (data not shown). However, it should be noted that mice with mixed background were used for Trp53 and Cdkn1a rescue experiments. The phenotype could be strain-dependent due to variation in MHC alleles. More conclusive results would require crossing mice into pure background."

However, DDB1 mainly functions as an adapter protein for the CUL4-DDB1 complex. The specificity of the complex comes from the DCAF family of proteins that recognize specific substrates. Expression of DCAF proteins is cell-type specific and as we have shown pluripotent and adult stem cell populations vary in expression. Mass spectrometry analysis of DDB1 interacting proteins in ESC, 293T, and HL60 cell lines demonstrate differential binding to specific DCAF proteins suggesting different substrates in these different cellular contents that may correlate with the different phenotypes. Some of the previous identified substrates have been associated with cell cycle control and DNA damage, however Kronke et al. demonstrates that two lymphoid transcription factors (IKZF1 and IKZF3) are also targeted for degradation by CUL4-DDB1 complexes utilizing CRBN, a member of the DCAF family, as the substrate recognizing protein of the complex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kronke et al., 2014</a>). Although in our mass spectrometry analysis we did not identify CRBN as an interacting partner, we found in hematopoietic (primitive myeloid) cells that DCAF7 interacted with the CUL4-DDB1 complex whereas Vprbp and DCAF11 were found to interact with DDB1 and silencing in ESC mimicked the loss of DDB1 phenotype. Interestingly, in multiple myeloma cells treatment with lenalidomide increased ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3, demonstrating that small molecules can modulate the CUL4-DDB1-DCAF complex."

The authors provide evidence supporting cell context dependent functions and binding partners of DDB1 and discrete roles for this protein in the maintenance of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic progenitor cells, as well as the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Reviewers agreed that the work on fetal and adult hematopoiesis is comprehensive and of high quality, although one reviewer found the T cell and ES cell work to be a bit more superficial, with conclusions drawn in the first part of the study that were in some cases inconsistent with those in the latter half. It would be useful if the authors worked towards a more unified analysis and discussion, and included specific mention of hematopoietic stem cells in the title (as this would give a more accurate representation of the majority of the data in the paper). In addition, reviewers raised several issues related to the interpretation of experimental data that should be addressed in the revised manuscript."

If cellular context is a key determinant of substrate interactions, then it may be misleading to extrapolate interactions in 293 and HL60 to T lymphocytes and HSPCs. It would be nice to see, at least, in vitro studies in HSPCs of the factors the authors implicated in ESCs (DDA1, VprBP, and DCAF11), some of which are also expressed in HSCs (i.e., VprBP and DCAF11).

In this breeding scheme, even littermates can differ with respect to histocompatibility alleles, so it is critical to have a clear explanation from the authors for why the experiments were not confounded by such a difference. For example, comment on whether there might be any linkage between the targeted alleles and histocompatibility alleles, and whether MHC alleles differ among the backgrounds of the mice used in the breeding.

If cellular context is a key determinant of substrate interactions, then it may be misleading to extrapolate interactions in 293 and HL60 to T lymphocytes and HSPCs. It would be nice to see, at least, in vitro studies in HSPCs of the factors the authors implicated in ESCs (DDA1, VprBP, and DCAF11), some of which are also expressed in HSCs (i.e., VprBP and DCAF11).

DDA1, Vprbp, and DCAF11 are all expressed at the transcript level in LSK progenitors, however due to obvious limitations in mass spectrometry we are unable to look at DDB1 interacting proteins in LSK (we usually get 50,000 LSK from each mouse). To address this question in HSPCs (LSK), we silenced Dda1, Vprbp, and Dcaf11 using RNAi (shRNAs) in colony forming (CFU) assays. I wanted to remind you here that deletion or silencing of DDB1 leads to a profound loss of colony forming ability of stem and progenitor cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Interestingly, silencing of the specific DCAF genes (that showed strong phenotypes in ES cell differentiation, see <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) in LSK led to varying and relatively mild effects on colony unit formation. For example, Ddda1 silencing had no effects on LSK differentiation, however, it was one of the strongest modulators of ES cell differentiation. Similarly, the effects of Vprbp silencing were negligible in LSKs but very significant in ES cells. We actually have studied hematopoiesis in Vprbp animals and found that its deletion does not significantly affects overall HSC differentiation (our unpublished data) supporting our CFU analysis demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10h</a>. On the other hand, Dcaf11 silencing appears to affect both LSK and ES cell differentiation. These results are now presented in subheading \u201cDDB1 interacts with distinct DCAF proteins in a cell type specific manner\u201d and can be found in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>."

As you see, in ES cells we achieve very mild \u2013 almost at wild-type levels \u2013 expression of exogenous DDB1. Despite this low expression, ESC-expressed DDB1 was found to interact with a significant number of DCAF proteins, even more that the DCAF proteins identified in HL60 cells where exogenous expression was higher. So we believe that it is unlikely that we simply had more DCAFs because we express DDB1 at higher levels. Moreover, the overall number of DDB1-interacting proteins identified by mass spec was very similar in all three populations (ESC=140, 293T=110, and HL-60=128)."

As different inheritance of histocompatibility or other alleles could confound experimental outcomes with such a breeding scheme, it is very important to be explicit about the background of the breeders and progeny, and to state clearly how many times each experiment was performed and with how many independent donor mice. In this breeding scheme, even littermates can differ with respect to histocompatibility alleles, so it is critical to have a clear explanation from the authors for why the experiments were not confounded by such a difference. For example, comment on whether there might be any linkage between the targeted alleles and histocompatibility alleles, and whether MHC alleles differ among the backgrounds of the mice used in the breeding. This information should be added to the Methods section, and the note in the legend \"mice were mixed background\" should explicitly state the backgrounds represented in the experimental mice, and the number of independent experiments performed for each assay.</i>"
