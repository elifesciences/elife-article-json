The structure of many insect pheromones typically consists of a hydrocarbon backbone, occasionally modified with various functional oxygen groups. Here we show that sex-specific triacylclyerides (TAGs) are broadly conserved across the subgenus <i>Drosophila</i> in 11 species and represent a novel class of pheromones that has been largely overlooked. In desert-adapted drosophilids, 13 different TAGs are secreted exclusively by males from the ejaculatory bulb, transferred to females during mating, and function synergistically to inhibit courtship from other males. Sex-specific TAGs are comprised of at least one short branched tiglic acid and a long linear fatty acyl component, an unusual structural motif that has not been reported before in other natural products. The diversification of chemical cues used by desert-adapted <i>Drosophila</i> as pheromones may be related to their specialized diet of fermenting cacti."

The structure of many insect pheromones typically consists of a hydrocarbon backbone, occasionally modified with various functional oxygen groups. Here we show that sex-specific triacylclyerides (TAGs) are broadly conserved across the subgenus <i>Drosophila</i> in 11 species and represent a novel class of pheromones that has been largely overlooked. In desert-adapted drosophilids, 13 different TAGs are secreted exclusively by males from the ejaculatory bulb, transferred to females during mating, and function synergistically to inhibit courtship from other males. Sex-specific TAGs are comprised of at least one short branched tiglic acid and a long linear fatty acyl component, an unusual structural motif that has not been reported before in other natural products. The diversification of chemical cues used by desert-adapted <i>Drosophila</i> as pheromones may be related to their specialized diet of fermenting cacti."

Plants and animals release pheromones to influence the behavior of other plants and animals, often without the recipient being aware of it."

Now, Chin et al. have discovered that male flies belonging to several species of fruit fly that live in the desert release chemicals called triacylglycerides (TAGs), which are commonly used for energy storage by many organisms as pheromones. During sex, the male fly rubs the TAGs onto the body of the female, which makes her less attractive to other male flies for several hours, thus increasing his chances of parenthood and passing his genes to future generations."

Chemical derivatization of the long OAc fraction confirmed the presence of an acetyl group (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Gas chromatography MS (GCMS) analysis of transesterified TLC fractions indicated tiglic acid, a 5-carbon branched unsaturated acid, as one of the fatty acyl moieties (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). No other 5-carbon fatty acid methyl esters were detected. Tandem MS with low energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) analysis provided the chain length and degree of unsaturation of each of the acyl chains present in each TAG. A similar motif was revealed among each of the molecules: a single long-chain fatty acyl component, 16\u201318 carbons in length, together with 2 short-chain fatty acyl side chains, each 2\u20135 carbons in length (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). For several of the more abundant TAG molecules, the position of the acyl chains on the glycerol backbone could be deduced based on the relative abundance of the product ions in the CID spectra. As described by <a href=\"#bib25 bib26\">Hsu and Turk (1999 and 2010)</a>, fragments reflecting the loss of substituent at the <i>sn</i>-2 carbon (middle of the glycerol backbone) are less abundant than ions reflecting losses at either the <i>sn</i>-1 or <i>sn</i>-3 carbons. Based on this observation, long-chain fatty acids are predominantly located at either <i>sn</i>-1 or <i>sn</i>-3 for the major TAGs at [M + Na]<sup>+</sup> 543 and 541 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and [M + Li]<sup>+</sup> 499, 501, and 527 (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). It was not possible to distinguish between <i>sn</i>-1 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions. The position assignments on the backbone are supported by analysis of synthetic standards in which a long-chain fatty acid is placed at <i>sn</i>-1. The relative abundances of fragment ions are similar to those observed from crude extract (<a href=\"#fig3s6 fig3s7 fig3s8\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6\u20138</a>). Notably, CID analysis of a fourth major TAG at [M + Li]<sup>+</sup> 487 resulted in low-intensity signals corresponding to loss of the C18:1 fatty acyl substituent, suggesting that this component is likely to reside at the <i>sn</i>-2 position (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Low-abundance signals for isobaric TAGs containing C18:2 and C18:1 fatty acids were also observed at [M + Li]<sup>+</sup> 501, 499, and 487 and are likely to represent minor components. In these cases, it was not possible to assign substituent positions."

The glycerol backbone positions for several TAGs are assigned based on the comparison with synthetic standards and ion product abundance patterns (dark gray boxes). Ambiguous backbone positions are in light gray."

                                "text": "To determine the double bond positions within each fatty acid, we used ozone-induced dissociation (OzID) mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#bib60\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brown et al., 2011</a>). Individual TAG species were mass-selected within an ion-trap mass spectrometer where they were exposed to ozone vapor. The resulting gas-phase ion\u2013molecule reaction facilitates targeted oxidative dissociation of carbon\u2013carbon double bonds present in the acyl chains. Fragmentation of the ozonide leads to formation of characteristic aldehyde and Criegee ions with a mass indicative of the positions of each double bond. OzID analysis of the TAG fraction revealed numerous positional isomers, with double bond positions between C9-C10 (<i>n</i>-9) and C11-C12 (<i>n</i>-7), indicating oleic and palmitoleic acid side chains, and between C2-C3 (<i>n</i>-2), consistent with tiglic acid (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Spectra from OzID analysis of TAG standards synthesized with oleic acid (C18:1, <i>n</i>-9) or linoleic acid (C18:2, <i>n</i>-6,9) support the double bond position assignments (<a href=\"#fig3s6 fig3s8\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6 and 8</a>). Double-bond geometry could also be deduced for two of the more abundant TAGs. <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-alkenes exhibit differential reactivity to ozone, resulting in differences in the overall abundances of the fragment ions and the relative abundance of the Criegee and aldehyde product ions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Poad et al., 2010</a>). The relative abundance of the aldehyde and Criegee ions for the molecules at [M + Na]<sup>+</sup> 543 and 541 are consistent with those of synthetic TAG standards synthesized with oleic acid and linoleic acid, both of which contain <i>cis-</i> double bonds (<a href=\"#fig3s6 fig3s8\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6 and 8</a>). In summary, MS analysis revealed considerable variation in the carbon chain length, degree of unsaturation, positions of fatty acyl chains, and double bond positions of both the short chain and long chain fatty acyl components (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). All of the analyzed TAGs contained tiglic acid. The unusual combination of short odd-branched chain fatty acids with a single linear long-chain component has not been reported before in natural products."

We hypothesized that sex-specific TAGs may play a similar role based on the sexually dimorphic pattern of expression and localization to a male sex organ. To test this prediction, a mate choice assay was used in which a na\u00efve male was given a choice to court either a virgin female or a recently mated female (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Male <i>Drosophila</i> courtship behavior consists of a sequence of stereotyped, quantifiable features, including wing vibration (\u2018singing\u2019), foreleg tapping, proboscis extension, and copulation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Spieth, 1974</a>). Courtship initiation and copulation preferences were measured since both indicate male choice while the latter is also influenced by female rejection behavior. Males from <i>D. arizonae</i> and <i>D. mojavensis</i> were significantly more attracted to virgin females than recently mated females (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Notably, significant levels of both TAGs and long OAcs were found on the anogenital regions of <i>D. arizonae</i> females shortly after mating but decreased by approximately 80% at 2\u20134 hr post-mating and were almost negligible at 8 hr post-mating (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Mated <i>D. arizonae</i> females became increasingly attractive over time, correlating with a decrease of the levels of TAGs and long OAcs on the cuticle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). From 4 hr onwards, males showed no significant preference between mated and virgin females. Female remating was observed starting only at 8 hr post-mating (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Taken together, these results show that the presence of male-transferred lipids on female cuticles is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in female attractiveness."

In these species, fewer males chose to initiate courtship with extract-perfumed females (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). <i>D. arizonae</i> was also significantly less likely to copulate with bulb-perfumed females, whereas <i>D. mojavensis</i> showed a tendency to avoid perfumed females (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). <i>D. navojoa</i> only rarely copulated under these experimental conditions, likely because males prefer to court in the presence of more flies.

Both combinations also inhibited courtship initiation (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Additionally, courtship initiation was affected by the combination of long OAcs with 1-palmitoleyl-2,3-ditiglyol and 1-oleyl-2,3-ditiglyol (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Thus, low amounts of several TAG species, inactive on their own, can act in synergy with each other to suppress male courtship and copulation. It is notable that none of the TAG combinations tested were effective without long OAcs despite our finding that a mixture of TAGs purified from extract was by itself sufficient to deter male attraction. It may be the case that a combination of several different TAG species is needed for courtship inhibition without the presence of long OAcs."

Earlier studies of <i>D. arizonae</i> and <i>D. mojavensis</i> cuticular lipids using GCMS found mostly linear and branched long-chain hydrocarbons, including dienes, trienes, and methyl-branched alkenes, 29\u201338 carbons in length (<a href=\"#bib62\">Toolson et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Etges and Jackson, 2001</a>). TAGs were not previously observed likely due to analytical limitations; under standard GCMS conditions, heavier molecules such as TAGs are not detected. The presence of TAGs in cuticular extracts is usually attributed to fat leaking from internal stores due to cuticular rupture. However, several indicators make it clear that sex-specific TAGs are exogenously secreted. First, signals for specialized TAGs were detected only from the ejaculatory bulb housed in the anogenital region of males but not virgin females, indicating a discrete, sexually dimorphic site of secretion. Second, sex-specific TAGs are structurally distinct from conventional TAGs found in other <i>Drosophila</i> tissues (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carvalho et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guan et al., 2013</a>). Last, short UV-LDI MS analysis times (below 30 s, corresponding to 1200 laser shots) causes minimal perturbation of the cuticle; breakdown of the outer layers appear only after 2000 laser shots (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yew et al., 2011</a>)."

Famously, the honey bee queen uses a blend of least nine different fatty acids and alcohols secreted by multiple glands (<a href=\"#bib30\">Keeling et al., 2003</a>) The parasitic wasp <i>Lariophagus distinguendus</i> was recently reported to use TAGs together with a branched alkane to promote mating behavior (<a href=\"#bib32\">K\u00fchbandner et al., 2012</a>). Food odors are also known to synergize with aggregation pheromones in beetles (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lin et al., 1992</a>) and with sex pheromones in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grosjean et al., 2011</a>). Pheromonal synergism between completely different classes of molecules is rare and may be a mechanism to increase combinatorial complexity. Interestingly, only some of the <i>D. arizonae</i> TAGs appear to play a role as an anti-aphrodisiac. The quiescent stereoisomers could be used as potential future chemical cues (<a href=\"#bib44\">Niehuis et al., 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "Sex-specific TAGs found on desert-adapted drosophilids are the first examples of natural products bearing combinations of branched and linear fatty acyl side chains. Conventional naturally occurring TAGs found in plant oils and animal fat typically consist of linear fatty acyl moieties that have 16, 18, or 20 carbons (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nelson et al., 2008</a>). Although medium and short chain fatty acyls have been found in TAGs from, respectively, whale blubber (<a href=\"#bib37\">Litchfield et al., 1971</a>) and bovine milk fat (<a href=\"#bib7\">Breckenridge and Kuksis, 1968</a>), they are only in combination with linear and even-numbered carbon acyls. In contrast, sex-specific TAGs from flies exhibit an unusual combination of short and long chain acyl components with odd and even numbers of carbons. To what extent can these unconventional structures be attributed to diet? Previous and current work has shown that altering the diet of desert-adapted flies results in a quantitative change in hydrocarbons and sex-specific triglycerides (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Toolson et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Etges et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Etges et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yew et al., 2011</a>). Notably, many of the substrates on which the drosophilids subsist and oviposit contain compounds that can be toxic for other animals. For example, desert-adapted <i>D. arizonae</i> and <i>D. mojavensis</i> feed on fermenting cacti, which have high levels of triterpene glycosides, medium chain fatty acids, and sterol diols, compounds which can serve as toxic plant defense chemicals (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fogleman and Danielson, 2001</a>). Similarly, <i>Drosophila subquinaria</i> and <i>Drosophila recens</i> are found exclusively on mushrooms that are rich in secondary metabolites such as isoprenoids and fatty acids in a variety of lengths, from 4 to 26 carbons (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wandati et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Pedneault et al., 2008</a>) but also contain high levels of toxic compounds like alpha-amanitin (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jaenike et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Courtney et al., 1990</a>). Slime fluxes, on which <i>D. virilis</i> and <i>D. robusta</i> can be found, have large bacterial communities that can be inhospitable to other drosophilids (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carson and Stalker, 1951</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Powell, 1997</a>). Bacterial wetwood infections have been shown to produce acetate, butyrate, valerate, hexanoate, and propionate (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ward and Zeikus, 1980</a>), which could be directly incorporated into the TAGs or serve as precursors for branched or linear fatty acids, as has been observed for nitidulid beetles (<i>Carpophilus</i> spp) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bartelt and Weisleder, 1996</a>). The ability of drosophilids that produce sex-specific TAGs to thrive on these specialized substrates alludes to the possibility that enzymes used for detoxification may have been adapted for TAG synthesis. Notably, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases have been identified in other insects as playing a crucial role in detoxification and cuticular lipid synthesis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Qiu et al., 2012</a>). In bark beetles, it has been suggested that a key cytochrome P450 enzyme used in pheromone synthesis was previously used for detoxification (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blomquist et al., 2010</a>). Alternatively, conservation of TAG expression may be more related to phylogenetic effects than functional adaptation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Oliveira et al., 2011</a>)."

Each of the desert-adapted drosophilids tested in this study are still able to produce TAGs despite being raised on standard laboratory fly media. Thus, desert-adapted drosophilids are capable of using precursors from the environment and synthesizing the components de novo though significant quantitative differences are found for some TAG molecules. Based on these observations, we expect that lab-raised flies are likely to have quantitative differences in lipid profiles compared to natural populations because of the differences between the natural diet and a highly simplified lab diet. Both pathways for precursor synthesis are used by numerous Coleoptera beetle species for the production of aggregation pheromones (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tillman et al., 1999</a>). The ability to utilize different production pathways may enable insects to switch host plants while preserving conspecific signaling. Elucidation of the biochemical pathways underlying TAG synthesis is needed to better understand whether dietary sequestration or de novo production is preferentially used by desert-adapted drosophlids and to determine the ancestral state of TAG production."

Specialized TAGs were prevalent across other <i>Drosophila</i> species and may also be found in other insect orders and have other functions. For example, triolein in the fire ant, <i>Solenopsis invicta</i>, acts as a brood pheromone and has application as bait when combined with toxicants (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bigley and Vinson, 1975</a>). The chiral 1,2-dioleyl-3-palmitolyl glycerol is also a brood pheromone in the honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Koeniger and Veith, 1984</a>). Taken together, triacylglycerides represent a broadly conserved and largely overlooked class of pheromones. Ultimately, to understand the evolutionary origin of these unusual molecules, it will be important to determine the behavioral function of sex-specific TAGs in other species and the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Using a broad range of analytical methods for chemical profiling will expand the detectable range of chemical classes used in communication. Correlating gene expression in the ejaculatory bulb across multiple TAG-expressing species will enable us to identify candidate biosynthetic enzymes and to provide molecular markers that will allow the evolution and function of this surprising chemical phenotype to be traced."

The resulting gas-phase ion\u2013molecule reaction facilitates targeted oxidative dissociation of carbon\u2013carbon double bonds present in the acyl chains. Fragmentation of the ozonide leads to formation of characteristic aldehyhde and Criegee ions with a mass indicative of the positions of each double bond. To determine the carbon\u2013carbon double bond positions within TAGs, alkali metal adduct ions were mass-selected within the modified linear ion trap mass spectrometer (see above) and allowed to react with ozone seeded in the helium buffer gas (<a href=\"#bib60\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>). To acquire OzID spectra, ions were isolated in the absence of collision energy and the reaction time (set by adjusting the activation time parameter within the XCalibr instrument control software) was typically 5\u201310 s per scan. OzID spectra reported here correspond to the average of at least 50 scans. Reaction of ozone with carbon\u2013carbon double bonds in the TAG acyl chains produces fragment ions that identify their position within the chain. Location of each double bond is indicated by the traditional nomenclature \u2018<i>n-x</i>\u2019 where \u2018<i>n</i>\u2019 refers to the number of carbon atoms in the chain and subtracting \u2018<i>x</i>\u2019 provides the location of the double bond (i.e., <i>x</i> represents the position of the double bond with respect to the methyl terminus)."

(2010)</a> observed that <i>cis</i> vs <i>trans</i> double bonds differed in terms of overall abundance and relative abundances of OzID product ions since trans-alkenes react faster with ozone. OzID analysis of the natural TAG and a synthetic version (synthesized with <i>cis</i> double bond geometry) produced similar spectra in terms of fragment ion abundances, supporting the <i>cis</i> assignment. In all other cases, we have placed a wavy line to illustrate ambiguity of the double bond configuration. We agree that synthesis of TAGs with variant substitution positions will be highly valuable for structural elucidation. The Mori laboratory is currently in the process of synthesizing TAGs with different substitution patterns of the glycerol, a procedure that is likely to require between 2-3 months. Once completed, we intend to perform the CID analysis and publish the results in a separate paper. However, for the current paper, we believe that the substitution patterns for the major TAG species (particularly ones that appear to have functional significance) that we have established should be sufficient."

Thin-layer chromatography was performed on dissected ejaculatory bulbs from 10 flies for each condition. TAGs were quantified according to the intensity of the primuline-stained TLC band. The results indicate a significant reduction in several, but not all, of the sex-specific TAGs when flies are raised on standard media. We conclude that a laboratory diet has an effect on TAG production and likely contributes precursors or makes precursors more readily available for incorporation.
