However, growing evidence suggests that a core endogenous role is to promote flexible adaptation to changes in the causal structure of the environment, through behavioral inhibition and enhanced plasticity. We used long-term photometric recordings in mice to study a population of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons, whose activity we could link to normal reversal learning using pharmacogenetics. We found that these neurons are activated by both positive and negative prediction errors, and thus report signals similar to those proposed to promote learning in conditions of uncertainty. Furthermore, by comparing the cue responses of serotonin and dopamine neurons, we found differences in learning rates that could explain the importance of serotonin in inhibiting perseverative responding. Our findings show how the activity patterns of serotonin neurons support a role in cognitive flexibility, and suggest a revised model of dopamine\u2013serotonin opponency with potential clinical implications."

However, growing evidence suggests that a core endogenous role is to promote flexible adaptation to changes in the causal structure of the environment, through behavioral inhibition and enhanced plasticity. We used long-term photometric recordings in mice to study a population of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons, whose activity we could link to normal reversal learning using pharmacogenetics. We found that these neurons are activated by both positive and negative prediction errors, and thus report signals similar to those proposed to promote learning in conditions of uncertainty. Furthermore, by comparing the cue responses of serotonin and dopamine neurons, we found differences in learning rates that could explain the importance of serotonin in inhibiting perseverative responding. Our findings show how the activity patterns of serotonin neurons support a role in cognitive flexibility, and suggest a revised model of dopamine\u2013serotonin opponency with potential clinical implications."

The results showed that when the activity in serotonin neurons was experimentally blocked, the mice tended to keep looking for a reward that was no longer available. Then, by recording the activity of serotonin neurons, Matias et al. found that it was the surprise of discovering a change in a previously familiar environment that activates serotonin neurons. It did not matter whether the change was better or worse than expected. The findings suggest that together with dopamine, another molecule involved in learning from rewards, serotonin could play an important role during reversal learning."

These studies have shown that 5-HT depletion, particularly in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of primates, causes perseverative errors, that\u00a0is, difficulties in stopping responses to previously rewarded stimuli which are no longer reinforced, without affecting learning of new associations or retention of learned associations (<a href=\"#bib16\">Clarke et al., 2007</a>). Such results seem to stem from two functions of endogenous 5-HT activation: inhibiting learned responses that are not currently adaptive (<a href=\"#bib72\">Soubri\u00e9, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bari and Robbins, 2013</a>) and driving plasticity to reconfigure them (<a href=\"#bib54\">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jitsuki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">He et al., 2015</a>). These mirror dual functions of dopamine (DA) in invigorating reward-related responses (<a href=\"#bib59\">Niv et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Panigrahi et al., 2015</a>) and promoting plasticity that reinforces new ones (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Steinberg et al., 2013</a>). However, while DA neurons are known to be activated by reward prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Eshel et al., 2015</a>), consistent with theories of reinforcement learning (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sutton and Barto, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>), the reported firing patterns of 5-HT neurons (<a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2016</a>) do not accord with any existing theories (<a href=\"#bib22\">Daw et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cools et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Nakamura, 2013</a>). Indeed, 5-HT neurons have been proposed to signal worse-than-expected outcomes by being activated by negative reward prediction errors in the reinforcement learning framework (<a href=\"#bib22\">Daw et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</a>), but there is little experimental evidence for such a signal in 5-HT neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hayashi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2016</a>) and 5-HT activation does not appear to drive aversive learning processes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Dugu\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">McDevitt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Qi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Miyazaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Fonseca et al., 2015</a>) the way DA drives appetitive learning (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Steinberg et al., 2013</a>)."

We reasoned that the scarcity of prediction error\u2013like responses in previous recordings of identified 5-HT neurons (<a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2016</a>) or unidentified raphe neurons (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hayashi et al., 2015</a>) might be due to inadequately strong prediction errors. In these studies, the omission of rewards in a small fraction of trials was used to generate prediction errors. While increasing the variability of the outcome, this results in <i>expected uncertainty.</i> In contrast, in a reversal task, there is an abrupt violation of previously stable predictions and a step increase in the frequency of the\u00a0prediction errors, termed <i>unexpected uncertainty</i>. Expected and unexpected uncertainty may differentially activate neuromodulatory systems (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yu and Dayan, 2005</a>)."

For two odors the US was a water reward, and for the other two it was nothing (that\u00a0is, only the tone was played). After training, mice showed learning of the odor\u2013outcome contingencies, as indicated by differences in the\u00a0anticipatory lick rate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> bottom)."

After approximately two weeks of training, mice showed robust CS-triggered anticipatory licking correlated to the reward value of the associated USs (large water &gt; small water &gt; neutral \u2248 air puff) and eye-blink responses to the delivery of air puffs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Thus, 5-HT neurons showed an excitatory response to a better-than-expected outcome, or positive reward prediction error (RPE). The response to the small reward was also modulated by reward expectation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), although to a lesser degree, perhaps due to the presence of a small response even after extensive training (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Like 5-HT neurons, DA neurons also showed stronger excitatory responses to water rewards immediately after reversal\u00a0when they violated cue-based predictions, as opposed to before reversal when they occurred as predicted (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

For this, five days after reversal,\u00a0on a small fraction (20%) of trials, a randomly-selected US was delivered at the time that a CS was normally presented (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We found that water rewards produced larger 5-HT responses when they were presented in this way, compared to when preceded by a well-learned cue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Of particular interest was that even neutral tones produced an excitatory response when an odor was expected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, 5-HT neurons were activated by the substitution of one neutral stimulus with another. DA neurons also responded strongly to uncued rewards, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>), but little to other uncued USs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Matsumoto et al., 2016</a>). Thus, consistent with the responses following CS\u2013US reversal, this experiment also showed that, with respect to water rewards and reward omissions, 5-HT neurons respond in the same manner to unexpected events, whether negative, neutral or positive, whereas DA neurons are primarily sensitive to unexpected events that have some reward value."

Moreover, during such negative reversals the time constant of DRN 5-HT responses was slower than that of anticipatory licking for all animals (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>; see <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for DA). We note that, while we expected that the adaptation of 5-HT CS responses to the reversal should be at least as slow as that of anticipatory licking for the two to be causally related, the fact that it was much slower (around eight times as slow) requires an\u00a0explanation. One possibility is that our behavioral readout (that\u00a0is, tongue protrusions long enough to be detected by our sensor) is just a \u2018tip-of-the-iceberg\u2019 of motor responses to appetitive cues, and that other, covert, movements also need to be suppressed by 5-HT during relearning, and thus 5-HT neurons need to be active until all motor responses to appetitive cues have disappeared. Alternatively, it may be the case that 5-HT CS responses could serve more than a mere motor suppression function during reversal learning, and contribute to the longer-lasting learning processes required for reversal learning (<a href=\"#bib37\">He et al., 2015</a>), such as those that prevent spontaneous recovery following extinction training (<a href=\"#bib39\">Karpova et al., 2011</a>)."

Midbrain DA neurons, on the other hand, responded oppositely to better-than-expected and worse-than-expected outcomes. Thus, whereas DA neurons could be described as reporting a signed RPE, 5-HT neurons appeared to report, in part, an unsigned RPE (but see below for discussion of responses to aversive events). That is, 5-HT neurons were sensitive not to the direction of error but to its magnitude.

Supporting this idea, we found that 5-HT neurons were also sensitive to substitution of one neutral cue for a cue of another modality (sound for odor).

By reporting such signals, 5-HT US responses would be suitable to drive plasticity and re-learning during reversal of contingencies. The strong excitatory response of the 5-HT system to negative RPEs, caused by reward omissions, provides a possible explanation for why inhibiting this system impairs negative reversal learning (<a href=\"#bib16\">Clarke et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bari et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). That is, during negative reversals or extinction learning, the 5-HT system, either directly or through an interaction with the DA system (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</a>), could facilitate trial-by-trial undoing of DA-dependent learning. Since 5-HT neurons also respond during positive prediction errors, such as during positive reversal or initial learning, such activation might compete with co-occurring DA signals, slowing positive learning, as has been described (<a href=\"#bib31\">Fletcher et al., 1999</a>). The preferential involvement of 5-HT in \u2018unlearning\u2019 responses could be explained by the relative effects of 5-HT release on downstream targets, where 5-HT may favor long-term depression (LTD) and DA long term potentiation (LTP) (<a href=\"#bib37\">He et al., 2015</a>)."

One possible explanation is that mice failed to learn the predictive relationship between the CS and the air puff. Indeed, mice showed air puff\u2013triggered blink responses, but failed to learn <i>anticipatory</i> blinking responses despite extensive training. This result likely depends on the relatively long duration of the CS\u2013US trace period, here 2 s (<a href=\"#bib67\">Reynolds, 1945</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boneau, 1958</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Caro-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015</a>; cf. <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsumoto et al., 2016</a>). This is consistent with the idea that mice did not learn the CS\u2013air puff association. If mice formed no CS-dependent predictions about the air puff, then they might have experienced each air puff as \u2018unpredicted\u2019, whether before or after reversal. In this case, the presence of robust air puff US responses would be consistent with an unsigned value prediction error. However, since we have no explanation for how mice could succeed in learning a CS\u2013reward association while failing to learn the CS\u2013air puff association, other explanations should also be considered."

In principle, following a reversal from large reward to air puff, one would have expected a contribution of the reward omission response to the US response, as seen in the small reward to neutral reversal. The lack of such a response could indicate either simple saturation or a suppressive influence of the air puff on the reward omission signal. A distinction between the encoding of rewarding vs. aversive events by the DA system has been proposed (<a href=\"#bib30\">Fiorillo, 2013</a>). The presence of dual signals might reflect the inclusion of multiple 5-HT neuronal populations within our photometric recordings. In future experiments, these could be distinguished using a\u00a0pathway-specific labeling, as has been done in the DA system (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lerner et al., 2015</a>; see further discussion below). On the other hand, VTA DA neurons have been reported to integrate reward and aversive outcome values, but with aversive responses being strongly modulated by the rate of reward available in the current context (<a href=\"#bib52\">Matsumoto et al., 2016</a>). In future experiments, it will be important to understand how individual 5-HT neurons integrate information from combinations of outcomes, and in different reward contexts."

Whereas mice can control the consumption of available water, they cannot control the delivery of air puffs; they are afforded no means to escape in the head-fixed configuration. It is therefore interesting to consider the possibility that 5-HT neurons might report errors of <i>control</i> rather than errors of prediction. Under this hypothesis, an aversive outcome such as the air puff continues to generate a response in 5-HT neurons because the organism has not managed to control this aspect of its environment. If the mouse were offered a means to escape, we would expect to see the air puff response diminish. Conversely, because the 5-HT US response is also sensitive to errors of a positive nature, we would also expect to see continued responses to a non-controllable reward, for\u00a0example, direct oral infusion of sucrose (<a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2016</a>). Such \u2018unsigned control errors\u2019 could provide the organism with a signal of the magnitude of cognitive or behavioral effort required to adapt to a given situation, a signal that could be read out for the purpose of energizing or deenergizing actions."

Indeed, 5-HT has been strongly associated with suppressing both impulsive and perseverative responses through \u2018behavioral inhibition\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Clarke et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cools et al., 2011</a>). In addition to US signals that could explain the contribution of 5-HT to uncertainty-driven learning, we also found CS or cue responses that could explain a direct and immediate contribution to behavioral control during environmental change. We found that 5-HT CS responses, like DA CS responses, were strongly positively correlated with CS value, consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hayashi et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, 5-HT and DA CS signals were qualitatively extremely similar, both after initial training and after relearning. Given that 5-HT and DA are thought to drive opposing processes of behavioral inhibition and invigoration, respectively (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cools et al., 2011</a>), this would suggest that the two systems effectively cancel one another out. However, surprisingly, we found that the CS responses of 5-HT neurons were not only much slower than DA neurons to adapt to new associations after the reversal, but were also maintained throughout the extinction of the maladaptive perseverative response, as would be needed to prevent interference of the old appetitive response. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation across animals in the post-reversal learning rates of trial-by-trial 5-HT activity and that of anticipatory licking (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

Specifically, because DA cue responses are quicker to establish, cues undergoing positive changes in outcome value will temporarily favor DA signals. Conversely, because DA cue responses are also quicker to withdraw, cues undergoing negative changes in outcome value will temporarily favor 5-HT signals. Thus, positive changes will favor DA and behavioral invigoration, and negative changes will favor 5-HT and behavioral suppression. This may explain why 5-HT is specifically critical in preventing responses to cues that were previously rewarding, which is observed experimentally (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Clarke et al., 2007</a>). The origins of the differences in 5-HT and DA learning dynamics will be important to uncover, and might arise from differences in the systems feeding into the two neuromodulators. Interestingly, neural responses in the caudate nucleus, a major recipient of DA projections (<a href=\"#bib15\">Clarke et al., 2011</a>), adapt faster during reversal learning, while the PFC, a major target of 5-HT projections (<a href=\"#bib57\">Muzerelle et al., 2016</a>), adapts more slowly (<a href=\"#bib61\">Pasupathy and Miller, 2005</a>)."

First, importantly, we established that the population from which we are recording contributes to reversal learning, and it is therefore a relevant population. Second, activity patterns were consistent across mice (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s2\">2</a>), despite inevitable small variations in infections and fiber placements (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the findings are robust to the precise population monitored. Third, single-unit recordings (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hayashi et al., 2015</a>) show that rewarding and aversive events activate the same individual DRN neurons (including identified 5-HT neurons), and are therefore not generated by distinct populations. Finally, because individual 5-HT neurons have broad projection fields (<a href=\"#bib57\">Muzerelle et al., 2016</a>) and transmit primarily by volume conduction (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dankoski and Wightman, 2013</a>), heterogeneity will tend to be averaged out through pooling by downstream targets."

While it has good genetic specificity, its spatial resolution is limited by the spread of the viral particles containing the hM4Di receptor in the DRN, and its temporal resolution is on the order of dozens of minutes. Additionally, although we know this approach should inhibit 5-HT neurons in vivo (<a href=\"#bib77\">Teissier et al., 2015</a>), we did not test the efficacy of this inhibition in our animals. The limited temporal resolution of this approach makes it impossible to distinguish the contribution of CS and US 5-HT signals to behavioral flexibility. Still, we have an indication that CS responses might play a role in behavioral inhibition of perseverative responding. This could potentially be resolved in future experiments using optogenetic inhibition."

Rather than carrying the positive and negative sides of a single-signed prediction error (<a href=\"#bib22\">Daw et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cools et al., 2011</a>), DA\u20135-HT opponency seems to be more complex and subtle. As has been classically described, the activity of DA neurons which we recorded closely resembled a so-called signed RPE (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>). The US-related 5-HT signals, on the other hand, resemble in important respects, but don\u2019t perfectly match, the concept of an \u2018unsigned RPE\u2019 signal. Thus, 5-HT neurons responded not to an opposing class of events, but to an overlapping and broader range of events compared to DA. In this respect, they might be acting as a kind of inhibitory \u2018surround\u2019 to DA\u2019s excitatory \u2018center\u2019, helping to sharpen the focus of behavioral attention. Nevertheless, just as DA signaling is increasingly acknowledged to be more complex than classically described (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Eshel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsumoto et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wise, 2004</a>), attributing a single function to 5-HT neurons is also clearly an oversimplification."

                                "text": "With respect to CS responses, 5-HT neurons showed a remarkably similar pattern of activity to that of DA neurons, scaling closely with the value of the stimuli. A possible explanation for this observation is that 5-HT CS responses could be learned by the same DA-dependent process that generates DA CS responses. If this were the entire story, then 5-HT and DA CS responses might simply balance and nullify one another. However, the fact that 5-HT CS responses evolved much more slowly than did DA CS responses means that such a balance will not hold in dynamic environments. This dynamic balance between positive and negative forces resembles the balance of excitation and inhibition in the cortex (for\u00a0example, <a href=\"#bib79\">Wehr and Zador, 2003</a>), albeit on a much slower time scale. Such a temporal asymmetry between opponent processes endows the joint system with novel and potentially important dynamics, which may be an important substrate in the dynamics of learning, as previously proposed (Solomon and Corbit, 1974). CS and US responses of a similar nature to those observed in 5-HT and DA neurons also appear to be observed in other neuromodulatory systems as well (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yu and Dayan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Dayan and Yu, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sara and Bouret, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hangya et al., 2015</a>). This suggests that, contrary to the notion that each neuromodulator reports a completely distinct signal (<a href=\"#bib22\">Daw et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Doya, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dayan, 2012</a>), they have highly overlapping signals, presumably derived from partly overlapping inputs, but with more subtle differences through which their joint actions are orchestrated."

Moreover, the results also suggest the need for a refinement in conventional conceptions of 5-HT\u2019s function in the regulation of mood, with implications for understanding its role in depression and other psychiatric disorders. More than reporting the affective value of the environment (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Luo et al., 2016</a>), we suggest that 5-HT facilitates the ability of an organism to adapt flexibly to dynamic environments through plasticity and behavioral control. The clinical benefits of an enhancement of 5-HT function would therefore stem not from directly biasing affective states toward the positive, but by preventing the negative consequences of maladaptive world views and facilitating adaptive change (<a href=\"#bib10\">Branchi, 2011</a>)."

During water deprivation each mouse\u2019s weight was maintained above 80% of its original value. Following infection and implantation surgery, mice were habituated to the head-fixed setup by receiving water every 4 s (6 \u00b5l drops) for three days, after which training in the odor-guided task started. A mouse nose poke (007120.0002, Island Motion Corporation) using an IR photoemitter-photodetector was adapted to measure licking as IR beam breaks. To deliver air puffs, a pulse of air was delivered through a tube to the right eye of the mouse. Sounds signaling the beginning of the trial and the outcomes were amplified (PCA1, PYLE Audio Inc.) and presented through speakers (Neo3 PDRW W/BC, Bohlender-Graebener). Water valves (LHDA1233115H, The Lee Company) were calibrated and a custom made olfactometer designed by Z.F.M. (Island Motion) was used for odor delivery. The behavioral control system (Bcontrol) was developed by Carlos Brody (Princeton University) in collaboration with Calin Culianu, Tony Zador (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) and Z.F.M. Odors were diluted in mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:10 and 25 \u00b5l of each diluted odor was placed inside a syringe filter (2.7 \u00b5m pore size, 6823\u20131327, GE Healthcare) to be used in two sessions (~100 trials for each odor). Odorized air was delivered at 1000 ml/min. Odors used were carvone (R)-(-), 2-octanol (S)-(+), amyl acetate and cuminaldehyde. For the behavioral task used in the hM4D experiment, these odors were associated with reward, reward, nothing and nothing, respectively. For the behavioral task used in the GCaMP6s experiment, they were associated with a large reward (4 \u00b5l water drop), small reward (2 \u00b5l water drop), neutral (no outcome) and punishment (air puff to the eye) before reversal, and with punishment, neutral, small reward and large reward after the\u00a0reversal\u00a0of the cue\u2013outcome associations, respectively. In each trial, white noise was played to signal the beginning of the trial and to mask odor valve sounds. A randomly selected odor was presented for 1 s. Following a 2 s trace period, the corresponding outcome was available. Mice completed one session per day. For hM4D experiments, odors were introduced in pairs. For photometry experiments, training started by presenting only the large and small reward trials to the mice, followed by the introduction of the neutral type of trial in the next session, and finally the punishment trial in the following one. Punishment trials were presented gradually until all four types of trials had the same probability of occurrence and each session consisted of 140\u2013346 trials (minimum to maximum, 223\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030, mean \u00b1 SD). Time to odor (foreperiod), trace period and inter-trial interval (ITI) were also gradually increased during training until mice could do the task with their final values: foreperiod was 3 to 4 s, taken from a uniform distribution, trace was fixed at 2 s, ITI was 4 to 8 s taken from a uniform distribution."

On the reversal day and the two following days, for experimental mice, CNO was diluted in the vehicle solution and delivered at a concentration of 3 mg/kg. In both reversal learning tasks used, we ensured that mice could correctly perform the task on at least three consecutive days before reversing the odor\u2013outcome contingency for the first time. On the reversal day, mice started the session as before and the contingencies were reversed at trial 50 in the hM4D experiment, and between the 32th and the 100th trial (73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012, mean \u00b1 SD) in the GCaMP6s experiments. One SERT-Cre mouse was excluded from the hM4D analysis for not showing a differential lick rate within 1.5 s of US delivery, between odors 1 and 2 (rewards) and odors 3 and 4 (nothing). Two mice were excluded from the GCaMP6s data analysis for bad fiber placement assessed after histology analysis (more than 400 \u00b5m away from the infection area): one SERT-Cre and one TH-Cre mouse. Additionally, another SERT-Cre mouse was discarded from the reversal data analysis because of experimental problems with the fiber during the reversal session. In four SERT-Cre mice and in all TH-Cre mice, at five to six days after the\u00a0reversal, we introduced uncued US trials during the task. These trials represented approximately 20% of the total number of trials in a session during which no odor cue was presented; the typical white noise of the foreperiod was immediately followed by one of the four possible outcomes, randomly selected (11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 uncued vs 44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 cued trials per session, mean \u00b1 SD). To analyze these data, four sessions with cued and uncued outcomes were pooled together for each mouse.

Beamsplitters (BS007, Thorlabs) and photodiodes (SM1PD1A, Thorlabs) were used to monitor the output of each laser. The laser beams were attenuated with absorptive neutral density filters (Thorlabs), and each was aligned to one of the two entrances of the three-stage tabletop black case (Doric Lenses). At the corresponding entrances the excitation filters used were 473 nm (LD01-473/10-25 Semrock) and 561 nm (LL02-561-25 Semrock). Inside the black case three interchangeable/stackable cubes (Doric Lenses) with dichroic mirrors were used: one to separate the 473 nm excitation light from longer wavelengths (Chroma T495LP), one to collect the emission light of GCaMP6s (FF552-Di02\u221225 \u00d7 36 Semrock), and one to separate the 561 nm excitation light from tdTomato\u2019s fluorescence (Di01-R561\u221225 \u00d7 36). A collimator (F\u00a0=\u00a012 mm, NA\u00a0=\u00a00.50, Doric Lenses) focused the laser beams in a single multimode silica optical fiber with 300 \u00b5m core and 0.22 NA (MFP_300/330/900\u20130.22_2.5m-FC_CM3, Doric Lenses), which was used for transmission of all excitation and emission wavelengths. The three-stage tabletop black case had two exits, one for each fluorophore emission, at which we placed the corresponding emission filters (Chroma ET525/50m for GCaMP6s and Semrock LP02-568RS-25 for tdTomato), and convergent lenses (F\u00a0=\u00a040 mm and F\u00a0=\u00a050 mm, Thorlabs) before the photodetectors (photomultiplier tube module H7422-02, Hamamatsu Photonics). The output signals of the PMTs were amplified by a preamplifier (C7319, Hamamatsu), acquired in a Micro1401-3 unit at 5000 Hz and visualized in Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design)."

For the behavioral experiments, lick rate was acquired at 1 KHz and smoothed using convolution with a Gaussian filter of 50 ms standard deviation. Mean anticipatory licking was calculated for each trial as the mean lick rate in the period of 500\u20132800 ms after odor onset, after subtracting the mean lick rate over a baseline period of \u2212500 to 500 ms around odor onset. To evaluate the aversiveness of the air puff delivered to the mice in the photometry experiment, we used a CCD camera (Point Grey) to record the right eye of six mice during several sessions at 60 Hz. To quantify blinking in video data, we manually selected the eye area in each session and calculated the mean pixel value for that area; then, for each frame, we subtracted this value from the previous frame to obtain a measure of movement. The start and end of blinking created a sudden increase and decrease, respectively, in the difference between the mean pixel value of consecutive video frames. In the time course analysis of the licking\u00a0behavior in the hM4D experiment, trials of sessions around reversal were concatenated and smoothing over three trials was performed along the\u00a0trials. For each reversed odor and each mouse, the last 50 trials before reversal were fit by a constant function of the form (A+B); the first 200 trials after the\u00a0reversal were fit by an exponential function of the form (A+B*exp(-t/\u03c4)) using <i>fminsearch</i> in MATLAB. The\u00a0conditions for this fitting to be done were: the last 100 trials before reversal had to be statistically different from trials 100\u2013200 after the\u00a0reversal (<i>t</i>-test), the change in licking pattern had to follow the correct trend of the reversal (increase in licking for positive reversals and decrease in licking for negative ones), and the time constant obtained had to be larger than 1. Mouse\u2013odor pairs that did not fulfill this condition were excluded (that\u00a0is, odor 4 of mice M#4 and M#5). Time constants were grouped according to the type of reversal and genotype with drug treatment, and compared using one-way ANOVA. Then, for each SERT-Cre mouse, the time constant of the reversal with the vehicle\u00a0was subtracted from the reversal with CNO. The same was done for WT mice, but subtracting the time constant of reversal two from that of reversal 1 (since CNO was delivered in both). <i>t</i>-tests were used to determine whether these differences had means significantly different from zero."

Statistical analysis was done by comparing each day with pre-reversal days \u22121 and \u22122. For each mouse, mean amplitude of response to each US on the reversal day was also compared to the day before the\u00a0reversal.

Images for DAPI, GFP and Alexa Fluor 592 were acquired, and cells expressing GCaMP6s and cells stained with 5-HT antibody were quantified in a 200 \u00d7 200 \u00b5m window in the center of the DRN.

To evaluate fiber location in relation to infection, images for DAPI, YFP or GFP and tdTomato were acquired with an upright fluorescence scanning microscope (Axio Imager M2, Zeiss) equipped with a digital CCD camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss) with a 10X objective. The location of the fiber tip was determined by the most anterior brain damage made by the optical fiber subtracted by its radius. The center of infection was estimated through visual inspection of slices as the location where there were most infected cells. The distance between the fiber tip location and center of infection was calculated as an anterior\u2013posterior distance, which was estimated by comparing each corresponding location in the mouse brain atlas (<a href=\"#bib62\">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</a>).

The argument that this difference involves a difference in control is interesting, but not tested directly. Also, what about blinks, which presumably could reduce the aversiveness of the air puffs. And what is the evidence that rodents learned to predict the air puffs as well as the positive rewards? Moreover, consider the reversals between the large reward and air puff. In theory, both unexpected outcomes should generate equal unsigned prediction errors. However, only the response to the large reward is higher when unpredicted. Response to the air puff is unchanged, with a trend to being lower. Even if animals failed to respond to air puffs appropriately (as the authors suggest in the Discussion), they should still detect that on unexpected air puff trials there is an omission of big reward. We know they have detected this omission and learned from it because they rapidly reduced licking to the CS. This should entail a large unsigned prediction error to omission of big reward at least as large as the clear response to omission of small reward. Indeed, DA had similar inhibitory responses to unexpected neutral and air puff USs. However 5-HT's air puff expectation effect was non-significant and the response actually trended to be larger for expected air puff, which is the opposite effect from what it should have. It seems like the most parsimonious account is that 5-HT reports unsigned prediction error except when an air puff is present, in which case it ignores the unsigned prediction error and has a stereotyped excitation. This would be a very interesting wrinkle on the conclusions, because the authors argue throughout the paper that 5-HT is important for learning, so there should be a big difference in reward learning when air puff is present versus absent. However, the present experiments don't provide evidence of this."

However, it is not tested directly, but perhaps could be with the existing data. Were correlations between 5-HT activity and behavioral flexibility? 5-HT responds more to positive than negative CSs but animals seem to learn about both with similar speed (at least in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). 5-HT responds more to unexpected neutral than unexpected small reward, and more to unexpected large reward than unexpected air puff, so if the authors were correct animals should learn at different rates from those outcomes. This could be tested. Also, the authors measure learning rates for CS but not US responses. Are their learning rates consistent? This seems highly relevant to their interpretations. For instance 5-HT CS responses are slow to learn but <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> makes US learning seem very fast. Does this mean that the US \"surprise\" response and CS \"value\" response are based on different expectations? If so this would be further evidence that the 5-HT responses obey different rules, and may not be explained by a single umbrella concept like \"surprise\" or \"unsigned prediction error\"."

This is especially salient in the context of electrophysiological recordings of individual DR neurons (including work from the senior author's lab [Ranade and Mainen, 2009]), that show a high degree of heterogeneity of individual DR (and identified 5-HT) neuronal responses. This is treated in the Discussion, but the limitations need to be more clearly defined. Indeed, Muzerelle et al., cited here to support the idea of diffuse projection targets of individual 5-HT neurons, actually shows quite a bit of target specificity, and agrees with work from Gagnon and Parent (PLoS ONE, 2014). Also, I strongly suggest changing the title, as firing patterns were not measured in this study."
