However, the particles of carbon that dye the lung black have received relatively little attention from researchers because they appear to be rapidly taken up by immune cells, are relatively insoluble, and seem rather inert. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Farrah Kheradmand, David Corry, James Tour and colleagues\u2014including Ran You as first author\u2014reveal important mechanisms by which these particles are able to trigger and sustain a permanent inflammatory process in the lungs (<a href=\"#bib6\">You et al., 2015</a>)."

These processes are driven by local inflammation that leads to the release of enzymes that digest the thin connective tissue between alveoli in a process called emphysema (<a href=\"#bib3\">Djekic et al., 2009</a>). This decreases the surface area over which oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged, and it also compromises the \u2018springiness\u2019 of the lungs. As the lungs become floppier and less springy, the airways inside them (themselves already inflamed by the smoke) become more prone to collapse, which makes it difficult for the patient to blow air back out of the lung. As this process progresses, patients develop increasing shortness of breath and respiratory failure."

They found that the staining in the lungs of smokers was localized within populations of immune cells called myeloid-derived dendritic cells. These cells consume pathogens and foreign materials in a process called phagocytosis, and then present the digested fragments to other immune cells so that the body can learn to recognize and attack them. You et al. found that the pigment within these cells is composed of clumps of spherical carbon particles: the particles had diameters in the range of 20\u201350 nanometers, hence the name nanocarbon black. The researchers also found the same material in the equivalent cells of mice that had been exposed to cigarette smoke."

Together, these cytokines enable immune cells called T cells to become T helper 17 cells, which promote inflammation and inhibit another type of T cell that normally act to constrain immune responses (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bettelli et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Benwell and Lee, 2010</a>). The tendency to cause DNA damage appears to depend on the size of the particles and their solubility in oil: this has important implications both for potential regulations governing the emission of carbon black and for further research on the biological effects of these pollutants."

This, in turn, initiates the activation of a complex of proteins called the inflammasome, which includes the Caspase-1 protein (<a href=\"#bib5\">Taniguchi and Sagara, 2007</a>). The activated inflammasome leads to the cleavage of Pro-IL1\u03b2 to make a mature signal protein called IL-1\u03b2, while also initiating processes that will lead to the death of the cell. The mature IL-1\u03b2 causes upregulation of several inflammatory pathways, including the increased transcription of IL-6. These cytokines then act together to trigger T lymphocytes to become T helper 17 (TH17) cells. These cells produce the inflammatory cytokine IL-17, which has been implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. When the antigen-presenting cell dies, the nanoparticles are released to be taken up by another generation of antigen-presenting cells, which lead to another cycle of inflammation. IL = interleukin; ASC = Adaptor Protein Apoptosis-Associated Speck-Like Protein Containing CARD."

As they die, these cells release their toxic contents, which can then be eaten by another generation of immune cells: this sets up a cycle of inflammation that gradually dissolves connective tissue in the lung."

They will also help us to understand the effects of other sources of air pollution and particulates. Since every human on earth is exposed to at least one form of carbon-based pollution, such as wood-burning stoves, petroleum fumes or even electronic cigarette vapor, this research has major implications both for future scientific inquiry and for public health policy."
