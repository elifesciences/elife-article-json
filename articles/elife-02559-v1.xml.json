Here, we report that the orphan TBP-associated factor TAF9B is selectively up-regulated upon in vitro motor neuron differentiation, and is required for the transcriptional induction of specific neuronal genes, while dispensable for global gene expression in murine ES cells. TAF9B binds to both promoters and distal enhancers of neuronal genes, partially co-localizing at binding sites of OLIG2, a key activator of motor neuron differentiation. Surprisingly, in this neuronal context TAF9B becomes preferentially associated with PCAF rather than the canonical TFIID complex. Analysis of dissected spinal column from <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice confirmed that TAF9B also regulates neuronal gene transcription in vivo. Our findings suggest that alternative core promoter complexes may provide a key mechanism to lock in and maintain specific transcriptional programs in terminally differentiated cell types."

Here, we report that the orphan TBP-associated factor TAF9B is selectively up-regulated upon in vitro motor neuron differentiation, and is required for the transcriptional induction of specific neuronal genes, while dispensable for global gene expression in murine ES cells. TAF9B binds to both promoters and distal enhancers of neuronal genes, partially co-localizing at binding sites of OLIG2, a key activator of motor neuron differentiation. Surprisingly, in this neuronal context TAF9B becomes preferentially associated with PCAF rather than the canonical TFIID complex. Analysis of dissected spinal column from <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice confirmed that TAF9B also regulates neuronal gene transcription in vivo. Our findings suggest that alternative core promoter complexes may provide a key mechanism to lock in and maintain specific transcriptional programs in terminally differentiated cell types."

The TAF9B protein works together with an enzyme (called PCAF) to help to switch on the genes that control the development of these cells. Without this regulatory protein, mouse stem cells grown in the lab fail to properly switch on the genes that are necessary to become motor neurons. These mutant stem cells also fail to efficiently switch off genes that stop stem cells from becoming more specialized. High levels of TAF9B were also found in the spinal cord of newborn mice and when Herrera et al. engineered mice that lack TAF9B, these mice did not properly regulate the expression of neuronal genes in their spines."

These factors play key roles in establishing gene expression patterns that dictate cell-type specific functions and characteristics. Cellular reprogramming and de-differentiation leading to the formation of induced pluripotent stem cells offer dramatic examples of how targeted expression of particular sets of transcription factors can control cell fate (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib13\">Graf, 2011</a>). Sequence-specific transcription factors work in concert with a cohort of co-activator complexes and core promoter recognition factors to execute transcriptional activation. These core promoter factors often called \u2018basal\u2019 or \u2018general\u2019 transcription factors have traditionally been considered invariant and universally required for the expression of all protein-coding genes. However, recent studies suggest that at least some components of this large and diverse group of factors necessary to form the transcriptional pre-initiation complex (PIC) can exhibit both promoter and enhancer targeting activities that are cell-type specific. This specificity depends on the variegated composition of the components in the PIC (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib7\">D'Alessio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">M\u00fcller et al., 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "The first evidence of tissue-specific functions of core PIC factors came from studies of TAF (TBP-associated factors) subunits in the core promoter recognition factor TFIID. A paralog of TAF4, called TAF4B, was found to control oocyte-specific activation of transcription in mouse ovaries (<a href=\"#bib11\">Freiman et al., 2001</a>). In <i>Drosophila,</i> a group of five TAF paralogs (No hitter/TAF4; Cannonball/TAF5; Meiois I arrest/TAF6; Spermatocyte arrest/TAF8; and Ryan express/TAF12) all play specific roles in spermatogenesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hiller et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, another orphan TAF, TAF7L, cooperates with TBP-related factor 2 (TRF2) to regulate spermatogenesis in mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cheng et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Zhou et al., 2013a</a>). Tissue-specific functions of TAF7L were also found in adipocytes where it acts in conjunction with PPAR<b>\u03b3</b> to control the transcription necessary for adipogenesis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zhou et al., 2013b</a>). In mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, TAF3 pairs up with CTCF to drive the expression of endoderm specific genes while in myoblasts TAF3 works with TRF3 in the differentiation of myotubes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). Collectively these experiments suggest that combinations of different subunits of the multi-protein core promoter factors can be enlisted to participate in gene- and tissue-specific regulatory functions. Thus, mouse ES cells and other progenitor cells very likely have quite different requirements for such factors compared to terminally differentiated mature cell-types. Dissecting the various diversified mechanisms that control gene transcription in terminally differentiated cells should contribute to our still rudimentary understanding of the gene regulatory processes that modulate homeostasis in somatic cells and those that could lead to degeneration of adult tissue in disease states. A more detailed analysis of these critical molecular mechanisms may also help improve new strategies to achieve efficient cellular reprogramming and stem cell differentiation."

In this study we explore whether TAFs or other core promoter recognition factors become engaged in neuronal specific functions to regulate the expression of neuronal genes. To address this question we used an in vitro differentiation protocol to induce murine ES cells to form spinal cord motor neurons (MN), which control muscle movement. Loss of motor neurons gives rise to devastating diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib33\">Robberecht and Philips, 2013</a>). Consequently, motor neurons have been the focus of intense study and several key classical sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors regulating the expression of motor neuron-specific genes have been identified (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib9\">di Sanguinetto et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kanning et al., 2010</a>). However, there was scant information regarding the role, if any, of core promoter factors in directing the network of gene transcription necessary to form neurons. In this report, we have combined genomics, biochemical assays, and gene knockout strategies to dissect the transcriptional mechanism used to generate motor neurons from murine ES cells in vitro as well as to uncover novel in vivo neuronal-specific changes in core promoter factor involvement and previously undetected co-activator functions."

We confirmed the generation of motor neurons in embryoid bodies (EBs) by immunostaining for motor neuron-specific markers LHX3 and ISL1/2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) as well as by RNA-seq analysis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To obtain enriched populations of motor neurons, we differentiated a murine ES cell line containing a motor neuron-specific promoter (<i>Mnx1</i>) fused to GFP as a means of isolating post-mitotic motor neurons present in these EBs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wichterle et al., 2002</a>). Using this highly enriched motor neuron cell population, we compared the mRNA expression levels of genes coding for canonical TAF subunits in TFIID as well as various TAF paralogs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). As seen in other differentiated cell types, several TAFs are down-regulated upon motor neuron differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">D'Alessio et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zhou et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Guermah et al., 2003</a>). Intriguingly, one TAF paralog (<i>Taf9b</i>) was significantly up-regulated in GFP expressing (GFP+) motor neurons but not in the GFP negative (GFP\u2212) cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We confirmed that the up-regulation of TAF9B and down-regulation of several other TAFs occur at the level of both mRNA and protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), and follows the kinetics of post-mitotic neuronal marker <i>Tubb3</i> but not the progenitor cell markers <i>Pax6</i> and <i>Olig2</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We next dissected spinal cord tissue from newborn mice and performed RNA-seq to measure in vivo <i>Taf</i> expression levels and compare them to those observed for mouse ES cells in culture. As expected, most <i>Taf</i> subunits of TFIID in newborn spinal cord are expressed at lower levels than in mouse ES cells, while <i>Taf9b</i> is up-regulated more than 10-fold, consistent with the results obtained with the in vitro differentiated motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Notably, changes in the expression levels of <i>Tafs</i> in newborn spinal cord are more pronounced than what we observed for the in vitro differentiated motor neurons. We also found that many components of the PIC and selected co-activators were down-regulated upon neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D and 1E</a>). These results strongly suggest that induction of TAF9B upon neuronal differentiation is specific and distinct from regulated expression of most other subunits of the PIC."

In these cells, all protein-coding exons of <i>Taf9b</i> have been replaced with the <i>LacZ-Neo</i> cassette (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As expected, the induction of <i>Taf9b</i> upon motor neuron differentiation was detected only in wild type (WT) cells but not in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). We found that <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells have a normal mouse ES cell morphology and can be grown in the presence of LIF without displaying any obvious cell growth or cell cycle defects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and data not shown). To determine the role of TAF9B in regulating transcription in murine ES cells, we performed RNA-seq analysis to compare global gene expression patterns in WT and <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells. The results show that TAF9B is largely dispensable for global gene expression with only a small number of genes deregulated under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Interestingly, whereas the core TAF components of TFIID have recently been reported to be critical for murine ES cell pluripotency and in controlling genes such as <i>Pou5f1</i>, <i>Nanog</i> and <i>Klf4</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pijnappel et al., 2013</a>), the absence of TAF9B did not affect expression of pluripotency markers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). These results suggest that, unlike other TAFs present in the canonical TFIID complex, TAF9B is dispensable for global gene expression and pluripotency of murine ES cells."

ES cells were differentiated as described previously and motor neuron markers <i>Isl1</i>, <i>Mnx1</i>, and <i>Lhx3</i> were measured by qRT-PCR. We observed a significant reduction in all motor neuron markers in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells upon differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Immunostaining for motor neuron marker ISL1/2 as well as western blot analysis for TUBB3 further confirmed that motor neuron differentiation was compromised in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). We next measured the down-regulation of ES specific markers <i>Pou5f1</i> and <i>Nanog</i> upon differentiation and found that <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells failed to efficiently down-regulate these ES cell markers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Immunostaining of OCT4 and NANOG confirmed that a fraction of cells in these neuralized EBs derived from <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells continue to express pluripotency markers, whereas few or no cells expressing OCT4 and NANOG were detected in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Consistent with the maintenance of an undifferentiated state, a higher number of dividing cells persisted in <i>Taf9b</i> KO EBs as determined by the marker for cellular proliferation Ki67 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We also found an increase in apoptosis in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells compared to WT controls during early stages of differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These differences in apoptosis were particularly prominent at day 4 when progenitor cells are most enriched. This is consistent with previous observations implicating TAF9B in cell survival and control of apoptosis in human HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen and Manley, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Frontini et al., 2005</a>). Taken in aggregate, our findings suggest that TAF9B is required for the efficient in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells into motor neurons, and that the absence of TAF9B causes the persistent expression of pluripotency markers under differentiation conditions."

We found that as motor neuron differentiation progressed there was a concomitant increase in the number of genes deregulated by the loss of TAF9B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Striking deregulation of genes in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells was observed at the time point at which progenitor cells are most enriched in these cultures (day 4). Genes known to be important for neuronal progenitor identity such as <i>Olig2</i>, <i>Pax6</i>, <i>Sox1</i>, <i>Nkx6-1</i>, <i>Nkx6-2, Gli1,</i> and genes controlled by the Notch signaling pathway were among the most down-regulated by the loss of TAF9B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Gene ontology (GO) terms analysis of down-regulated genes showed categories such as neuron differentiation and anterior/posterior pattern formation among the most enriched terms (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Among up-regulated genes we found genes involved in apoptosis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), which is consistent with the increase in apoptosis levels we observed in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells at this time point. By day 6, when post-mitotic motor neurons are normally present in these cultures, approximately 10% of all expressed genes were down-regulated and another 10% were up-regulated in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells. This finding suggests that TAF9B is specifically required for the appropriate expression of a subset of genes, rather than for global gene expression in these differentiated EBs. The most significant GO term categories of genes down-regulated by the loss of TAF9B in this time point included genes involved in neuron differentiation, axogenesis, and neuron projection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Moreover, the specific motor neuron markers <i>Lhx3</i>, <i>Lhx4, Isl1</i>, <i>Mnx1</i>, and pan-neuronal marker <i>Tubb3</i> were among the most down-regulated genes in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast, genes up-regulated in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells were enriched in categories such as vascular development, stem cell maintenance, and other non-neuronal developmental categories (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Contrary to the large number of genes deregulated in neuralized EB samples, we found that samples differentiated for 2 days have a relatively small number of genes affected in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells. Interestingly, genes involved in differentiation were still found among these early down-regulated genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). These results indicate that TAF9B controls the expression of specific genes required at least for the in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells into motor neurons."

                                "text": "To determine whether TAF9B acts directly to regulate neuronal genes we mapped its binding sites genome-wide by ChIP-seq. Because most TAFs are expected to bind to promoters as part of TFIID in the PIC, we compared ChIP-seq peaks of TAF9B with those of RNA POL2. Approximately a third of all detected TAF9B binding regions overlapped with RNA POL2 occupancy (TAF9B-POL2) and mapped generally near transcription start sites (TSS) of protein coding genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). However, TAF9B peaks located at TSS were not enriched at promoters of neuronal specific genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Intriguingly, approximately two thirds of all TAF9B binding regions showed little or no overlap with regions of high RNA POL2 occupancy (TAF9B-only) and were generally located distal to annotated TSS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B, 1C</a>). Importantly, genes with TAF9B bound to regions distal to their TSS were significantly enriched in neuronal genes categories, including GO terms such as midbrain-hindbrain boundary development, rostrocaudal neural tube patterning and dorsal spinal cord development (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Several of the most down-regulated genes in the absence of TAF9B detected by RNA-seq (e.g., <i>Neurog2</i> and <i>Lhx4</i>) were associated with TAF9B distal binding sites (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,E</a>). Moreover, genes bearing distal TAF9B peaks (e.g., 500\u20135000 bp from TSS) showed a higher percentage of genes down-regulated in <i>Taf9b</i> KO neuralized EBs than control gene sets (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that distal TAF9B binding sites are likely functional regulatory elements controlling neuronal genes. We subsequently compared the binding sites of TAF9B to the binding sites of OLIG2, a key transcriptional activator involved in motor neuron differentiation mapped previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mazzoni et al., 2011</a>). We found co-localization between TAF9B and OLIG2 at both the TAF9B distal peaks and at the TAF9B TSS peaks, suggesting that TAF9B and OLIG2 act in concert at a subset of neuronal genes to regulate gene expression during motor neuron development (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The incomplete overlap of TAF9B and OLIG2 peaks may in part represent intrinsic differences between progenitor cells and post-mitotic neurons, since the OLIG2 binding was performed with neuralized EBs enriched for progenitor cells while TAF9B mapping was done with EBs enriched for post-mitotic motor neurons. In addition, it is likely that TAF9B co-localizes with activators other than OLIG2 in this developmental pathway."

In human HeLa cells, TAF9B had previously been reported to be a component of both the TFIID and SAGA complexes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frontini et al., 2005</a>). To test whether TAF9B in mouse neurons is primarily associated with TFIID or SAGA-like complexes, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments with antibodies against TAF9B using in vitro differentiated motor neurons. We observed little detectable association of TAF9B with TAF4 and TAF7, core components of the TFIID complex, while TBP antibodies co-IP'ed those TFIID components efficiently. In contrast, we observed an association between TAF9B and PCAF, a histone acetyltransferase present in the mammalian SAGA complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Immunoprecipitations of 293T cells transfected with flag-tagged versions of TAF9B or TAF9 confirmed that these IPs are specific for TAF9B and not the closely related TAF9 subunit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We also performed TAF9B co-IP experiments on dissected spinal column tissue samples from WT and <i>Taf9b</i> KO newborn mice, confirming that the interactions between TAF9B and PCAF occur in vivo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Thus, TAF9B primarily associates with PCAF likely in a SAGA-like complex rather than the canonical TFIID in murine neurons."

As expected, spinal cord isolated from newborn KO animals did not express TAF9B (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Given that <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells in vitro showed clear de-regulation of genes in both progenitor cells and post-mitotic motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we surmised that loss of TAF9B in vivo may affect not only motor neuron formation but perhaps also proper differentiation of other cell types present in the spinal cord. To test whether neuronal gene expression in vivo is specifically affected in the absence of TAF9B, we carried out RNA-seq analysis to compare whole lumbar spinal column tissue dissected from newborn WT and KO littermates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Our data indicate that genes down-regulated in the absence of TAF9B are enriched for neuronal genes including gene categories such as neuron projection, synapse and axonogenesis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Among the down-regulated genes identified by RNA-seq were neuronal genes such as <i>Map1b</i>, <i>L1cam</i>, <i>Nefm, Nefh</i>, and <i>Isl2</i>. Gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR of lumbar spinal column tissues confirmed that those neuronal genes are consistently down-regulated in KO compared to WT littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Several different markers of specific neuronal populations, as well as the general marker <i>Tubb3,</i> were also affected in the absence of TAF9B, suggesting a global defect in neuronal gene expression in the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). These results are also consistent with a global reduction in neuronal tissue compared to surrounding non-neuronal tissue in the dissected spinal column preparations. Our data suggest that the observed pan-neuronal down-regulation and loss of neuronal tissue may be due to problems in the control of gene expression that coordinates the precise differentiation of progenitor cells during neuronal development. These in vivo results taken together with our in vitro differentiation studies strongly support the notion that TAF9B is specifically required for the regulation of neuronal genes during neuronal development in the spinal cord."

                        "text": "The control of tissue-specific gene expression has been largely attributed to the combinatorial action of transcriptional activators and repressors. These regulatory factors are thought to interact in concert with a highly conserved and prototypic set of core promoter recognition proteins and co-activators that form the PIC at gene promoters. However, this model has been challenged by different studies demonstrating changes that occur in the core promoter machinery in a tissue-specific manner (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib7\">D'Alessio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</a>). Despite the emerging roles that these core promoter components play in regulating cell-type specific gene expression, relatively little was known about possible changes that may occur in the composition of core promoter factors during neuronal differentiation. In this study, we screened for changes in the expression of core promoter factors including TAFs, general transcript factors (GTFs), and mediator subunits (MEDs) upon neuronal differentiation. We found that most of the components in the mammalian PIC are expressed at relatively low levels in dissected spinal cord tissue compared to ES cells. Likewise, we observed down-regulation of several of these core promoter recognition components during in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells into motor neurons. By contrast, one orphan TAF, TAF9B, becomes highly up-regulated during motor neuron formation. Using a loss-of-function approach, we found that TAF9B is required for the efficient expression of neuronal genes upon in vitro motor neuron differentiation. Importantly, we found that TAF9B is dispensable for global gene expression in undifferentiated ES cells in contrast to the critical role that other TAFs in TFIID play in these cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pijnappel et al., 2013</a>). Using ChIP-seq, we found that TAF9B binds promoter and distal regulatory regions of neuronal genes co-localizing in a subset of regions with OLIG2, a key regulator of motor neuron differentiation. Strikingly, <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice showed defects in the expression of neuronal genes examined by transcriptome analysis of whole spinal column tissues. Importantly, the mechanism by which TAF9B mediates neuronal-specific transcription programs is unlike all previous TAF involvement in cell specific function: rather than operating through TFIID or distal enhancer complexes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Freiman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zhou et al., 2013b</a>), it associates with a SAGA/PCAF co-activator complex."

Different cell types employ distinct combinations of activators that must engage in specific protein\u2013protein interactions with core promoter factors. We speculate that rather than existing as a static complex awaiting recruitment by these transcription factors, core promoter complexes themselves must undergo compositional changes using cell type-specific components such as TAF9B. These alternative promoter complexes expand the diversity and number of possible protein\u2013protein transactions necessary to achieve proper fine-tuned control of gene expression. Furthermore, we speculate that such diversified core machineries might provide a mechanism to help lock down and maintain the functions and identity of differentiated cell types. We imagine that in a given cell type, if the silencing of an undesirable activator or repressor is imperfect, their specific interacting partners in the targeted core machinery may nevertheless not be present, thus serving as a fail safe mechanism to prevent unscheduled alterations in programs of gene transcription. We suspect that such core promoter complex dependent control and maintenance of cell identity would likely be accompanied by activator selectivity and integrated with changes in chromatin structure and other layers of regulation that must work coordinately to keep expression patterns stable yet responsive to different stimuli in terminally differentiated cells. We anticipate that further analysis of adult neuronal cell-types as well as other differentiated somatic cells will bring new insights regarding the use of alternative core machineries that regulate gene expression in normal and disease states."

We found that mice lacking TAF9B are viable, indicating that this orphan TAF is either not critical for normal development of cell-types other than neurons or its function is partly redundant with the closely related TAF9 homolog. We established that indeed <i>Taf9</i> is highly expressed in both mouse ES cells and neurons (as detected by RNA-seq). It is possible that TAF9 partially compensates for the loss of TAF9B thus blunting further global gene expression defects in <i>Taf9b</i> KO cells. In human HeLa and chicken DT40 cells partially redundant functions have been observed for these paralogs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen and Manley, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Frontini et al., 2005</a>). It will be interesting to test whether <i>Taf9</i> KO mouse are viable and whether the double KO of these two related genes (<i>Taf9</i> and <i>Taf9b</i>) results in more pronounced phenotypes. No <i>Taf9</i> KO mice have been reported to date. <i>Taf4b</i> and <i>Taf7l</i> KO mice are also viable, but unlike <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice, they are infertile (<a href=\"#bib11\">Freiman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Falender, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Zhou et al., 2013a</a>). Our results suggest that TAF9B is not critical for gametogenesis, in contrast to what has been observed for these two other orphan TAFs. Instead, our results point to a model where TAF9B is involved in the activation of neuronal genes by binding to distal and promoter proximal DNA regulatory elements associated with the histone acetyltransferase PCAF that, like its paralog GCN5, are subunits of the SAGA/STAGA/TFTC complex. This complex contains several TAFs shared with TFIID including TAF6, TAF9, TAF5, TAF10, TAF12, and a de-ubiquitinase (DUB) module that removes ubiquitin from histone H2B (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib34\">Spedale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Weake and Workman, 2012</a>). Because TAFs are structural components of both SAGA and TFIID complexes, it is possible that TAF9B is affecting the competitive recruitment or activity of a SAGA-like complex in place of TFIID."

Interestingly, several lines of evidence connect the activation of Notch dependent genes with the PCAF-containing complex providing a potential link between PCAF, TAF9B, and activation of these genes. For example, PCAF has been shown to cooperate with another co-activator protein, p300, in Notch intracellular domain-dependent transcription assays using chromatin templates in vitro, as well as in transfection/reporter assays (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kurooka and Honjo, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wallberg et al., 2002</a>). Other components of the SAGA complex have been linked to the specific control of gene expression in cells of the central nervous system. Mutations in two subunits of the <i>Drosophila</i> DUB complex, Nonstop and Sgf11, lead to defects in neural development in the optic lobe (<a href=\"#bib39\">Weake et al., 2008</a>). In mice, mutations in the HAT domain of GCN5 result in defects in cranial neural tube closure and embryonic lethality (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bu et al., 2007</a>). In humans, mutations in the DUB subunit ATXN7 are associated with the development of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7, a disease characterized by the loss of motor control as well as retinal defects (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib21\">Koutelou et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, we observed that <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice display defects in eye development including microphthalmia and cataracts-like phenotypes albeit with modest penetrance (data not shown). The type of neuronal-specific role performed by TAF9B is reminiscent of the cell-type specific roles of particular subunits of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex BAF. This complex undergoes changes in composition upon neuronal differentiation as specific BAF subunits are incorporated in neuronal progenitors cells as well as in post-mitotic neurons (<a href=\"#bib30\">Olave et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lessard et al., 2007</a>)."

It is also possible that the down-regulation of neuronal genes observed in whole spinal column tissues in <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice may represent a specific loss of neuronal tissue relative to the surrounding vertebrae due perhaps to defects in neuronal progenitor cells during embryonic development. In future experiments, we hope to address the extent of potential neurological defects in <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice, including deficits in motor skills as well as other potential neurological defects due to the role that TAF9B may be playing in other neuronal populations besides motor neurons. Preliminary experiments using <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice carrying the <i>LacZ</i> reporter gene suggest that <i>Taf9b</i> is highly expressed in the developing hypothalamus at mid-gestation (data now shown). In a recent study describing neuronal activity-dependent ribosome profiling in the adult mouse hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib20\">Knight et al., 2012</a>), <i>Taf9b</i> can be identified in the genomic data set as highly expressed in this tissue compared to several other TAFs. Moreover, the levels of <i>Taf9b</i> mRNA associated with ribosomes increased when neurons in the hypothalamus were activated, while several other TAFs were expressed at low levels or not enriched in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. These results suggest that TAF9B may be involved in setting up transcriptional responses in at least certain neuronal circuits in the hypothalamus. In the future, it will be interesting to directly test the role of TAF9B in the adult hypothalamus and to extend the analysis to other adult neuronal types."

The authors report here that the TBP-related factor TAF9B is strongly and selectively induced upon motor neuron differentiation, and is required for the expression of a subset of neuronal-lineage genes. Taf9b mutant ESCs do not show a gross perturbation in their gene expression profile but neuronal gene marker transcription is selectively disrupted and their ability to be differentiated into MN is compromised. In agreement with the central hypothesis of this work, ChIP-seq analysis reveals that Taf9b associates with not only proximal elements but also to distal presumptive regulatory regions that are engaged by the sequence and lineage specific transcription factor Olig2. Moreover, Taf9b associates poorly with Taf4 and Taf7 but strongly with PCAF. Gene expression analysis of the spinal cord of Taf9b mutant mice reveals an altered expression profile where some genes expressed in neurons are down-regulated. Overall, the identification of TAF9B as a lineage-specific transcriptional regulator important for neuronal differentiation in cell culture and mice is an important contribution. There will clearly be strong interest in TAF9B going forward as a modulator/regulator of ESC differentiation and potentially also in hypothalamus function, for which this paper will be an important resource."

To address this question, we have analyzed the expression of different neuronal markers in the dissected lumbar spinal column tissue as suggested by the reviewers. We analyzed in our RNA-seq data all the markers for post-mitotic neuronal populations, as described by Alaynick et al<i>.</i> 2011, and the results are presented in the new Supplementary file 2. We observed the down-regulation, to various degrees, of most neuronal specific markers without a clear pattern of deregulation specific for any particular neuronal type. We also performed qRT-PCR analysis for selected marker genes using several WT and <i>Taf9b</i> KO littermates and observed the down-regulation, to different extents, of most of the markers tested (New <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7-figure supplement 1E</a>). There is a strong linear correlation between the RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis using different littermates (WT: n=6, KO: n=8) for the 27 genes tested, further validating our genomic data and conclusions. These results suggest that the defects in gene expression observed in <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice are likely pan-neuronal, affecting most neuronal cell types, rather than specific neuronal populations. We have included a few sentences describing these findings in the Result section. As mentioned in the Discussion section, a global defect in neuronal gene expression may also be consistent with a specific loss of neuronal tissue relative to other non-neuronal tissues in the lumbar spinal column, perhaps due to defects controlling gene expression in the absence of TAF9B during neuronal development. These results are consistent with our <i>in vitro</i> MN differentiation experiments showing that neuronal gene expression is clearly affected at neuronal progenitor as well as post-mitotic MN stage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Although our expression data are more consistent with a global defect in neuronal expression in <i>Taf9b</i> KO mice, the lack of spatial information for the defects in gene expression in the spinal cord in our experiments does not allow us to completely rule out that certain neuronal types may be more severely affected than others. We think that further experiments that are beyond the scope of this paper will be necessary to unambiguously address this interesting question. However, the inclusion of several gene markers in our qRT-PCR analysis as well as the detailed analysis of the RNA-seq data presented in Supplementary file 2 strengthens the conclusion that neuronal genes are controlled by TAF9B <i>in vivo</i>."

Several genes regulated by the Notch signaling pathway (e.g. <i>Neurog2</i> and <i>Hes5</i>) were among the most down-regulated genes in our <i>in vitro</i> MN differentiation assays in the absence of TAF9B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

(iii) Mutations in subunits of the SAGA complex (DUB submodule) are associated with defects in neural development in the optic lobe in <i>Drosophila</i>.

It is likely that other subunits of this complex, including PCAF, will have a strong co-localization with TAF9B in ChIP-seq assays as suggested by the reviewers, but more experiments will be necessary to address this issue. As for OLIG2, we observed a total co-localization with TAF9B peaks of close to 40% in our data. The \u223c23% of co-localization mentioned by the reviewers is for only one category of TAF9B peaks (TAF9B-only), another \u223c16% of TAF9B peaks co-localized with OLIG2 in the TAF9B-POL2 category. In our new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> showing TAF9B classified as TAF9B at TSS and TAF9B distal peaks, the same total co-localization with OLIG2 is observed. As mentioned in the discussion, the incomplete co-localization may be due in part to differences in the binding of these factors between progenitor cells and post-mitotic cells, as OLIG2 binding sites were mapped on EB enriched in progenitor cells and TAF9B in post-mitotic MNs.
