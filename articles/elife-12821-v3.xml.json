Yet, mutations in apoptosis regulators cause only minor defects in vertebrate development, suggesting that another developmental cell death mechanism exists. While some non-apoptotic programs have been molecularly characterized, none appear to control developmental cell culling. Linker-cell-type death (LCD) is a morphologically conserved non-apoptotic cell death process operating in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and vertebrate development, and is therefore a compelling candidate process complementing apoptosis. However, the details of LCD execution are not known. Here we delineate a molecular-genetic pathway governing LCD in <i>C. elegans</i>. Redundant activities of antagonistic Wnt signals, a temporal control pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase signaling control heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), a conserved stress-activated transcription factor. Rather than protecting cells, HSF-1 promotes their demise by activating components of the ubiquitin proteasome system, including the E2 ligase LET-70/UBE2D2 functioning with E3 components CUL-3, RBX-1, BTBD-2, and SIAH-1. Our studies uncover design similarities between LCD and developmental apoptosis, and provide testable predictions for analyzing LCD in vertebrates."

Yet, mutations in apoptosis regulators cause only minor defects in vertebrate development, suggesting that another developmental cell death mechanism exists. While some non-apoptotic programs have been molecularly characterized, none appear to control developmental cell culling. Linker-cell-type death (LCD) is a morphologically conserved non-apoptotic cell death process operating in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and vertebrate development, and is therefore a compelling candidate process complementing apoptosis. However, the details of LCD execution are not known. Here we delineate a molecular-genetic pathway governing LCD in <i>C. elegans</i>. Redundant activities of antagonistic Wnt signals, a temporal control pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase signaling control heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), a conserved stress-activated transcription factor. Rather than protecting cells, HSF-1 promotes their demise by activating components of the ubiquitin proteasome system, including the E2 ligase LET-70/UBE2D2 functioning with E3 components CUL-3, RBX-1, BTBD-2, and SIAH-1. Our studies uncover design similarities between LCD and developmental apoptosis, and provide testable predictions for analyzing LCD in vertebrates."

Cell death not only counters cell production, but also supports morphogenesis and tissue sculpting, and destroys cells that could be harmful, such as autoreactive cells in the immune system or genetically abnormal cells that may promote tumorigenesis. Developmental and homeostatic cell elimination are not passive processes but rather follow a highly coordinated, genetically encoded program (<a href=\"#bib16\">Green, 2011</a>). A major goal has been to identify the molecular basis of the programs controlling regulated cell demise in development. One such program, apoptosis, has been studied extensively over the past four decades. Some proteins that promote apoptosis, such as BCL2 and FAS, are mutated in human disease (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fisher et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rieux-Laucat et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tsujimoto et al., 1985</a>), indicating that apoptosis contributes to normal human physiology."

Similarly, mice homozygous for knockout alleles of key apoptotic genes, including caspase-3, caspase-9, Apaf-1, or Bax and Bak, can survive to adulthood (<a href=\"#bib23\">Honarpour et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kuida et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lindsten et al., 2000</a>), a surprising observation given the prevalence of cell death in murine development. Indeed, nearly half of spinal cord motor neurons generated during vertebrate development are normally deleted, and this process occurs unabated in the absence of caspase-3 or caspase-9 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oppenheim et al., 2001</a>). While caspase-independent non-apoptotic processes may play key roles in developmental cell death, little is known about their molecular underpinnings.

Our functional, genetic, and molecular studies demonstrate that HSF-1 adopts a specific role, distinct from its well-described protective role in the heat-shock response, to promote LCD. We show that <i>let-70</i>, encoding a conserved E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is an important transcriptional target of this pro-death developmental activity of HSF-1, but not of the HSF-1 stress-response function. LET-70 expression, as well as expression of ubiquitin and some proteasome components, increases just before LCD onset, and this increase requires the Wnt, LIN-29, SEK-1/MAPKK pathways, and HSF-1. CUL-3/cullin, RBX-1, BTBD-2, and SIAH-1 E3-ubiquitin ligase components function in the same pathway as LET-70 and promote LCD."

Thus, linker cell position might, in part, dictate cell death onset. We considered the possibility that secreted ligands of the Wnt pathway, which are expressed in restricted spatial domains in <i>C. elegans</i>, contribute to LCD. We examined animals carrying lesions in each of the five <i>C. elegans</i> Wnt genes and found that in <i>egl-20</i>/Wnt mutants, the linker cell survives inappropriately (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), and surviving cells are not engulfed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, linker cell migration, a complex multi-step process dependent on many genes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schwarz et al., 2012</a>), is unaffected in <i>egl-20</i> single mutants. Likewise, expression of reporter genes, including <i>lag-2</i> promoter::GFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), appears unaffected. Thus, <i>egl-20</i> mutations do not generally perturb linker cell fate, suggesting that the gene has a specific role in LCD control."

This raises the possibility that the role of HSF-1 in LCD may be different from its role in the canonical heat-shock response. To test this idea directly, we examined expression of GFP reporters for HSF-1 target genes normally induced during heat shock and found that they are not induced in the linker cell during LCD (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>).

However, no rescue is evident without heat exposure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), suggesting that the <i>hsp-16.2</i> promoter is not normally induced during LCD.

A prediction arising from these data is that the LCD and heat-shock functions of HSF-1 might compete with each other. To test this, we first observed that while the linker cell of wild-type males raised at 20\u00b0C always dies, some wild-type adult males raised at 25\u00b0C harbor a surviving linker cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), suggesting that the heat-shock role of HSF-1 might compete with its LCD role. To test this more directly, we subjected males to a 37\u00b0C heat shock 4\u00a0hr prior to LCD onset and found that these animals also exhibit a surviving linker cell. Importantly, males heat-shocked 6\u00a0hr before LCD onset exhibit fewer surviving linker cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These results are consistent with the idea that heat-shock functionally sequesters HSF-1 away from its LCD role, and that activity of HSF-1 just before the cell dies is required to promote LCD. These results also explain why we were able to rescue <i>bar-1</i> mutants with the <i>hsp-16.2</i> promoter::\u0394N-<i>bar-1</i> transgene, as heat shock was performed 10\u2009hr before LCD onset, well before the activity of HSF-1 is required."

As RNAi can induce off-target effects, we confirmed our results by examining two non-overlapping RNAi targeting fragments and obtained similar results (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,E</a>). <i>let-70</i>(RNAi) animals exhibit surviving linker cells with normal ultrastructure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), indicating that <i>let-70</i> likely acts in promoting LCD and not in corpse degradation. Consistent with this observation, surviving linker cells are unengulfed (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Similar induction is seen with a fosmid recombineered to contain 18.9 kb surrounding the genomic <i>let-70</i> locus fused to GFP (n&gt;25). We wondered whether the expression of other components of the UPS might also be induced in the linker cell with similar kinetics.

The antagonistic Wnt pathways we describe may provide positional information to the linker cell, as the relevant ligands are expressed only near the region where the linker cell dies. The LIN-29 pathway, which controls timing decisions during the L4-adult molt, may ensure that LCD takes place only at the right time. Finally, while the TIR-1/SEK-1 pathway could act constitutively in the linker cell, it may also respond to specific cues from neighboring cells. Indeed, MAPK pathways are often induced by extracellular ligands. We propose that these three pathways, together, trigger activation of HSF-1. Our data support a model in which HSF-1 is present in two forms, HSF-1<sup>LC</sup>, promoting LCD, and HSF-1<sup>HS</sup>, protecting cells from stresses, including heat shock. We postulate that the redundant LCD initiation pathways tip the balance in favor of HSF-1<sup>LC</sup>, allowing this activity to bind to promoters and induce transcription of key LCD effectors, including LET-70/UBE2D2 and other components of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), functioning through E3 ligase complexes consisting of CUL-3, RBX-1, BTBD-2, and SIAH-1."

Heat-shock factors are thought to be protective proteins, orchestrating the response to protein misfolding induced by a variety of stressors, including elevated temperature. Although a role for HSF1 has been proposed in promoting apoptosis of mouse spermatocytes following elevated temperatures (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nakai et al., 2000</a>), it is not clear whether this function is physiological. In this context, HSF1 induces expression of the gene Tdag51 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hayashida et al., 2006</a>). Both pro- and anti-apoptotic activities have been attributed to Tdag51 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Toyoshima et al., 2004</a>), and which is activated in sperm is not clear. Recently, pathological roles for HSF1 in cancer have been detailed (e.g. <a href=\"#bib35\">Mendillo et al., 2012</a>), but in these capacities HSF1 still supports cell survival."

Here, we have shown that HSF-1 has at least partially non-overlapping sets of stress-induced and developmental targets. Indeed, typical stress targets of HSF-1, such as the small heat-shock gene <i>hsp-16.49</i> as well as genes encoding larger chaperones, like <i>hsp-1</i>, are not expressed during LCD, whereas <i>let-70</i>, a direct transcriptional target for LCD, is not induced by heat shock. Interestingly, the yeast <i>let-70</i> homologs <i>ubc4</i> and <i>ubc5</i> are induced by heat shock (<a href=\"#bib47\">Seufert and Jentsch, 1990</a>), supporting a conserved connection between HSF and UBE2D2-family proteins. However, the distinction between developmental and stress functions is clearly absent in this single-celled organism, raising the possibility that this separation of function may be a metazoan innovation."

One possibility is that whereas the stress response appears to be mediated by HSF-1 trimerization, HSF-1 monomers or dimers might promote LCD roles. Although this model would nicely account for the differential activities in stress responses and LCD of the HSF-1(R145A) transgenic protein, which would be predicted to favor inactivation of a larger proportion of higher order HSF-1 complexes, the identification of conserved tripartite HSEs in the <i>let-70</i> and <i>rpn-3</i> regulatory regions argues against this possibility. Alternatively, selective post-translational modification of HSF-1 could account for these differences. In mammals, HSF1 undergoes a variety of modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), which, depending on the site and modification, stimulate or repress HSF1 activity. In this context, it is of note that p38/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of HSF1 represses its stress-related activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chu et al., 1996</a>), and the LCD regulator SEK-1 encodes a MAPKK. However, no single MAPK has been identified that promotes LCD (E.S.B., M.J.K. unpublished results), suggesting that other mechanisms may be at play."

Remarkably, we showed that chromatin regulators play a key role in <i>let-70</i> induction and LCD (J.A.M., M.J.K and S.S., manuscript in preparation), suggesting, perhaps, that differences in HSF-1 access to different loci may play a role in distinguishing its two functions."

Nuclear crenellation is evident in dying linker cells and in degenerating cells in polyQ disease (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham et al., 2007</a>) and the TIR-1/Sarm adapter protein promotes LCD in <i>C. elegans</i> as well as degeneration of distal axonal segments following axotomy in <i>Drosophila</i> and vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib40\">Osterloh et al., 2012</a>). The studies we present here, implicating the UPS and heat-shock factor in LCD, also support a connection with neurodegeneration. Indeed, protein aggregates found in cells of patients with polyQ diseases are heavily ubiquitylated (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kalchman et al., 1996</a>). Chaperones also colocalize with protein aggregates in brain slices from SCA patients, and HSF1 has been shown to alleviate polyQ aggregation and cellular demise in both polyQ-overexpressing flies and in neuronal precursor cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Neef et al., 2010</a>). While the failure of proteostatic mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases is generally thought to be a secondary event in their pathogenesis, it is possible that this failure reflects the involvement of a LCD-like process, in which attempts to engage protective measures instead result in activation of a specific cell death program."

Briefly, worms were synchronized by treating gravid hermaphrodites with alkaline bleach and allowing the eggs to hatch in M9 medium overnight. Synchronized L1s were released onto fresh NGM plates seeded with OP50 or HT115 <i>E. coli</i> containing the RNAi clone of interest, and maintained at 20\u00b0C. Animals were picked to a new plate as late L4s with a fully retracted tail tip with rays visible under the unshed L4 cuticle. Two hours later, newly molted adults were mounted on slides on 2% agarose-water pads, anaesthetized in 30\u2009mM sodium azide or 5\u2009mM tetramisole, and examined on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 or AxioScope A1 under Nomarski optics and widefield fluorescence at 40x or 63x. Images were acquired through a Zeiss AxioCam and the Axiovision software. The linker cell was identified by green fluorescence (from reporter transgenes) as well as by its location and morphology. A linker cell was scored as surviving if its nucleus was circular with an intact nucleolus, if the cell shape was not rounded, and if the cell had not shed any large blebs. All other cells were scored as dead or dying. Rescuing extrachromosomal arrays contained a <i>lag-2</i>p::mCherry construct, and, in an effort to prevent selection bias towards survival, males with mCherry-expressing linker cells were picked as L3s for scoring the following day as young adults, as above. Some Wnt pathway mutants exhibited two linker cells. For these strains, animals with only one visible linker cell were picked as L3s to score the following day.
