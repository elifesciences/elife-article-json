Here, we used a loss-of-function genetic screen in human haploid KBM7 cells to discover the mechanism of action of the anticancer natural product ophiobolin A (OPA). We found that genetic inactivation of de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) mitigates OPA cytotoxicity by reducing cellular PE levels. OPA reacts with the ethanolamine head group of PE in human cells to form pyrrole-containing covalent cytotoxic adducts and these adducts lead to lipid bilayer destabilization. Our characterization of this unusual cytotoxicity mechanism, made possible by unbiased genetic screening in human cells, suggests that the selective antitumor activity displayed by OPA may be due to altered membrane PE levels in cancer cells."

Here, we used a loss-of-function genetic screen in human haploid KBM7 cells to discover the mechanism of action of the anticancer natural product ophiobolin A (OPA). We found that genetic inactivation of de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) mitigates OPA cytotoxicity by reducing cellular PE levels. OPA reacts with the ethanolamine head group of PE in human cells to form pyrrole-containing covalent cytotoxic adducts and these adducts lead to lipid bilayer destabilization. Our characterization of this unusual cytotoxicity mechanism, made possible by unbiased genetic screening in human cells, suggests that the selective antitumor activity displayed by OPA may be due to altered membrane PE levels in cancer cells."

The method revealed that ophiobolin A was less able to kill cancer cells if the cells had lower levels of a molecule called phosphatidylethanolamine in their surface membranes. This observation led Chidley et al. to show that ophiobolin A enters the membrane of human cancer cells and combines chemically with phosphatidylethanolamine to form a new composite molecule. Further experiments showed that the formation of this composite molecule disrupted a model membrane, which suggests that ophiobolin A kills cancer cells by breaking their membranes."

Compounds with anticancer activity can be readily identified in cytotoxicity assays and other phenotypic screens\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Harvey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eggert, 2013</a>). To use these small molecules as anticancer drug leads or to identify new chemotherapy molecular targets, it is essential to characterize the molecular mechanism of action (MOA) that underlies cytotoxicity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Schenone et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bunnage et al., 2015</a>). However, as\u00a0unraveling the MOA of bioactive small molecules remains challenging and time consuming\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Schenone et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ziegler et al., 2013</a>), the MOA of many natural products that display promising anticancer activities in phenotypic screens remains uncharacterized\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib51\">Shoemaker, 2006</a>). An example of such a natural product is ophiobolin A (OPA), a plant toxin isolated from pathogenic fungi of the <i>Bipolaris</i> genus which displays cytotoxicity at nanomolar concentrations against a range of cancer cell lines\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Au et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Bury et al., 2013</a>). OPA induces paraptosis, a form of non-apoptotic cell death, in glioblastoma cells and displays antitumor activity in a mouse glioblastoma model\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Bury et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dasari et al., 2015</a>). The toxicity of OPA to plants is believed to involve calmodulin inhibition via formation of a covalent adduct between OPA and specific lysine side chains\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib36\">Leung et al., 1984</a>). More recently, it has been shown in synthetic studies that primary amines react with the 1,4-dicarbonyl moiety of OPA to form covalent adducts and that this moiety is critical for animal cell cytotoxicity, leading the authors to suggest that the MOA of OPA in animal cells is through covalent modification of an unknown intracellular target protein\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Dasari et al., 2015</a>). In conclusion, OPA represents an interesting candidate for the treatment of glioblastomas that are resistant to classical pro-apoptotic therapeutic approaches, but the lack of information on cellular targets of OPA impedes any further development."

We discovered that inactivation of the pathway for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), also named the Kennedy pathway, confers resistance to OPA. Increased OPA resistance was correlated with decreased cellular PE levels. Surprisingly, we determined that the molecular target of OPA is PE itself; OPA forms a covalent adduct with PE in human cells. This work illustrates the power of unbiased genetic screens in human cells in discovering novel MOAs of compounds identified in phenotypic screens."

Before applying the screen to studies of compounds of unknown MOA displaying anticancer activity, we first determined whether such screens can robustly identify genes involved in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs with well-characterized MOAs. Briefly, we used a retroviral gene-trap approach to generate approximately 75 million insertions in the near-haploid human cell line KBM7, covering more than 95% of all expressed genes\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Carette et al., 2011</a>). This library of loss-of-function cell lines was treated with a toxic dose of anticancer drug and resistant mutants were allowed to grow over 3 weeks. Retroviral insertion sites were identified by amplification of the genomic sequence flanking the insertion site, high-throughput sequencing, and mapping to the human genome. Insertions in exonic regions or in the sense orientation of intronic regions are typically expected to cause gene inactivation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Carette et al., 2009</a>). For each gene locus, we calculated an enrichment p-value by comparing the number of inactivating insertions in the pooled drug-resistant cells to the number of such insertions in mutagenized cells before selection. This enrichment p-value allows the identification of genes whose inactivation renders cells resistant to the toxic effects of the small molecule tested (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As expected, we observed enrichment of inactivating insertions in genes known to play a role in the MOA of these anticancer compounds (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For instance, doxorubicin and etoposide induce cytotoxicity by forming a ternary complex with DNA and the enzyme topoisomerase IIA\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib43\">Pommier et al., 2010</a>). In both screens, we detected a significant enrichment of inactivating insertions in gene <i>TOP2A</i>, which encodes topoisomerase IIA (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013b</a>). Bortezomib kills cancer cells by proteasome inhibition\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams, 2004</a>) and, accordingly, we observed a significant enrichment of inactivating insertions in genes encoding proteasome subunits (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2d</a>). In addition to targets of anticancer drugs, the screens also identified transporters and genes known to metabolize the drug tested (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, loss-of-function screens in KBM7 cells are a powerful way to initiate MOA studies of anticancer compounds."

There is precedent for small molecules that target the Kennedy pathway: the antihistamine and antiemetic drug meclizine directly inhibits PCYT2, reducing the average flux through the Kennedy pathway\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Gohil et al., 2013</a>). To explore the possibility that OPA exerts cytotoxicity by inhibiting or activating one of the enzymes in the Kennedy pathway, we measured the activity of the pathway after OPA treatment in the two commonly used human cell lines, HEK293T and HCT116. Cells were treated with OPA (or vehicle) and then incubated with ethanolamine\u00a0[1,2-<sup>14</sup>C], the substrate of the first enzyme in the Kennedy pathway. Interestingly, when either cell line was treated with concentrations of OPA that induced mild cytotoxicity, both the average flux through the Kennedy pathway (measured by accumulation of the radiolabel into PE) and the steady state level of PE were <i>increased</i> compared to vehicle-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). In contrast, when we treated cells with meclizine we observed the expected decrease in the flux through the pathway and reduced PE content (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). Since the change in enzyme activity induced by OPA treatment is small, we do not believe that OPA acts directly on an enzyme in the Kennedy pathway to cause cytotoxicity."

If this hypothesis is correct, adding exogenous PE along with OPA to the growth medium of cells should result in the formation of PE-OPA covalent adducts in the medium. The majority of these adducts should not partition efficiently into cells due to limited aqueous solubility, and thereby adding exogenous PE should reduce the number of OPA molecules available to react with endogenous PE and kill cells. In agreement with this prediction, addition of a commercial preparation of PE to cells treated with a cytotoxic amount of OPA rescued cell viability, whereas addition of the phospholipids phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylserine (PS) had no effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). PE extracts from diverse sources were all similarly able to rescue cellular viability, suggesting that small quantities of impurities in these preparations are not likely responsible for OPA inactivation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement\u00a01a</a>). To provide additional evidence that the difference in the effects of PE and PC on OPA toxicity derive solely from differences in the head group (and not differences in fatty acid composition or impurities), we assayed a pair of commercial lipid preparations: one that consists of an extract of PC, and an identical PC extract in which the choline head group of PC has been exchanged for ethanolamine to yield a transphosphatidylated PE extract. When tested in the OPA inactivation assays, transphosphatidylated PE rescued cell viability whereas PC did not, substantiating the claim that PE is the molecule responsible for OPA inactivation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement\u00a01a</a>). In addition, we observed that constituents of the head group of PE, ethanolamine and <i>O</i>-phosphorylethanolamine, could inactivate OPA, although much less potently than PE, and that\u00a0triethanolamine (lacking a primary amine) had no effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement\u00a01b</a>)."

Based on the mechanism of the Paal-Knorr reaction and the specific reactivity of OPA, the reaction between PE and OPA is believed to proceed through two potential mechanisms: (i) elimination of a water molecule leading to formation of an imine and subsequent rearrangement to an enamine. Cyclization of the enamine followed by dehydration yields the final pyrrole-containing adduct. (ii) Cyclization of the hemiaminal leads to formation of a dihydroxypyrrolidine. A double elimination of water and double bond shift leads to the final pyrrole-containing adduct. In studies involving the formation of pyrrole adducts from the reaction of 4-oxohexanal and a primary amine, the reaction is known to proceed through the mechanism involving cyclization of the hemiaminal\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Amarnath et al., 1995</a>). Under certain conditions, pyrrole adducts are known to be oxidized and the two main expected products are the lactam and hydroxylactam derivatives\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib55\">Sullivan et al., 2010</a>). In addition, OPA contains an unsaturated aldehyde moiety which is known to readily react with thiols in a Michael addition reaction\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Grimsrud et al., 2008</a>). 4-Oxo-2-nonenal, a product of cellular lipid oxidation which has similar reactive functionalities as OPA, has been shown to readily react with <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Amarnath and Amarnath, 2015</a>). Interestingly, initial Michael adduct formation of OPA with a thiol would not prevent a subsequent Paal-Knorr reaction with PE and furthermore these two sequential reactions could lead to protein-lipid crosslinking, a potential cause of cytotoxicity."

In contrast to ethanolamine, adding serine to the growth medium of cells does not lead to OPA inactivation, suggesting that the primary amine in the serine head group is less reactive with OPA than that in the ethanolamine head group (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement\u00a01d</a>).

To test the hypothesis that OPA also reacts with PE through its primary amine, we explored the product of the reaction between OPA and ethanolamine. Incubation of OPA with an excess of ethanolamine abolished cytotoxicity and analysis by LC-MS/MS revealed that the main product of this reaction is consistent with formation of a covalent adduct with two dehydration reactions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c\u2013d</a>). Incubation of the reaction product of OPA and ethanolamine with Ehrlich's reagent\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Amarnath et al., 2004</a>) yielded a purple solution (A<sub>max</sub> = 580 nm), characteristic of pyrroles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). Addition of salicylamine and pentyl-pyridoxamine, potent scavengers of 1,4-dicarbonyls, to OPA led to its inactivation at concentrations 30- and 300-fold lower than for ethanolamine, consistent with the known kinetics of these scavengers in Paal-Knorr reactions\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Amarnath et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement\u00a01e</a>).

We first confirmed the efficacy of this approach by synthesizing PE-OPA covalent adducts in vitro and hydrolyzing these adducts with PLD to release ethanolamine-OPA (Etn-OPA) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Etn-OPA was unequivocally characterized by its exact mass, retention time, and MS/MS fragmentation pattern using the reaction product of OPA with ethanolamine as a standard (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). The detection of Etn-OPA was dependent on the presence of PE and OPA, and PLD treatment, demonstrating that OPA forms a pyrrole-containing covalent adduct with PE which PLD is able to hydrolyze into Etn-OPA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>)."

We thus hypothesized that PE-OPA adduct formation could lead to destabilization of cellular lipid bilayers and be the main cause of OPA cytotoxicity. To determine whether OPA induces membrane leakiness due to adduct formation, we used artificial liposomes whose PE content we could modulate. We prepared large unilamellar lipid vesicles (LUVs) composed of a variable ratio of dioleoyl-PE to dioleoyl-PC and loaded with the fluorescent probe calcein\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen and Cleland, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2001</a>). As calcein fluorescence becomes dequenched upon release from LUVs, an increase in fluorescence can be used as an indicator of liposome leakage. We observed that OPA treatment caused extensive liposome leakage, and that the extent of leakage is directly dependent on both the PE content of the liposomes and on the OPA concentration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Importantly, we observed that liposomes composed only of PC or with very low PE content remain intact even at high OPA concentration, indicating that the leakage is likely specifically due to the formation of PE-OPA adducts. These results clearly show that OPA destabilizes lipid bilayers, supporting our hypothesis that membrane permeabilization is the main cause of OPA cytotoxicity."

Leakage assays were initiated by addition of OPA and were monitored by quantification of the fluorescence of calcein, which dequenches upon release from liposomes.

When applied to cells, OPA accumulates in the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane as it is a lipophilic compound.

The Kennedy pathway genes identified in the screen of OPA led to the identification of a phospholipid molecule as the cellular target of OPA. This discovery was possible due to the unbiased nature of the screen and would have been difficult to achieve using alternative methods such as affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. Few studies have yet taken advantage of the recent development of novel genetic tools in human cells to identify the target of small molecules, and this is the first study to uncover a non-protein based target\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib42\">Nijman, 2015</a>). Here we show that OPA forms a pyrrole-containing covalent adduct with PE in human cells. Reduction of PE levels through inactivation of the Kennedy pathway results in a reduction in OPA cytotoxicity. We also show that PE-OPA adduct formation leads to destabilization of lipid bilayers in vitro. Collectively, this study indicates that PE is the main target of OPA in human cells and leads to the hypothesis that formation of PE-OPA adducts directly causes the observed cytotoxicity of OPA through membrane destabilization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>)."

While we cannot exclude the possibility that covalent modification of cellular proteins contributes to the observed toxicity of OPA,\u00a0our experimental results show that the concentration of PE required to inactivate OPA in vitro is at least 2000-fold lower than that of ethanolamine or lysine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This selectivity may arise because, at the concentrations tested, ethanolamine and lysine are freely soluble in aqueous buffers whereas PE forms insoluble lipid aggregates. Considering the lipophilic nature of OPA, it is likely that OPA accumulates in the lipid aggregates and efficiently reacts with PE due to high local concentrations or to the hydrophobic environment, or both. In a comparable way, we believe that the selectivity in living cells is the result of accumulation of OPA in lipid bilayers and efficient reaction with PE, the most abundant primary amine in human lipid bilayers\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib58\">Vance and Tasseva, 2013</a>). The observation that OPA does not react with ethanolamine in human cells, despite efficient reaction with PE, supports this claim (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c\u2013d</a>)."

We surmise that the observed cytotoxicity of OPA reflects the amount of covalent PE-OPA adducts formed in cells, which, based on the mechanism of the Paal-Knorr reaction, should be dependent on the concentrations of both OPA and PE. Accordingly, we observed that a mild reduction in PE levels (16\u201324%) was accompanied by a mild increase in OPA resistance (IC<sub>50</sub> from 43 nM in wild-type cells to 70\u201385 nM in the mutants) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement\u00a04a</a>).

Notably, the C-6 epimer of OPA (6-<i>epi</i>-OPA) is 40-fold less cytotoxic than OPA\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Dasari et al., 2015</a>), although both compounds would form the same pyrrole adduct upon reaction with PE, as the stereocenter at position 6 is lost with pyrrole formation. This observation must mean that the reaction of PE with 6-<i>epi</i>-OPA is on the order of 40-fold slower than the reaction of PE with OPA. The ring cyclization step is the rate limiting step of the Paal-Knorr reaction (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and this step is strongly influenced by the stereochemistry of the 1,4 diketone; rates of pyrrole formation can be up to 57-fold different between stereoisomers\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Amarnath et al., 1991</a>). Thus, the 40-fold difference in potency between OPA and 6-<i>epi</i>-OPA can likely be attributed to differences in the rate of pyrrole adduct formation, and this observation supports our model that cytotoxicity depends on the amount of PE-OPA adduct formed."

As seen in the LUVs leakage experiments, OPA induces strong membrane permeabilization in model membranes and the extent of permeabilization is dependent on PE content (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Interestingly, this observation is consistent with our expectation that the rate of adduct formation is dependent on PE content and suggests that OPA might display higher potency against cells or tissues containing high PE contents. Also, the dependence of membrane leakiness on PE content provides a mechanistic basis for our observation that Kennedy pathway KBM7 mutants are resistant to OPA due to lower PE levels. Cytotoxicity through modification of PE has previously been reported for polygodial, a 1,4-dialdehyde antifungal compound, which has been shown to form a pyrrole-containing adduct with PE on the cell surface that is directly linked to its antifungal activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Fujita and Kubo, 2005</a>). Furthermore, it has been previously shown that covalent modification of PE with isoketals alters membrane curvature because the newly formed bulky hydrophobic head group partitions to the lipid bilayer and increases lateral pressure\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Guo et al., 2011</a>). We believe such a mechanism may contribute to the ability of PE-OPA adducts to disrupt lipid bilayers, and suspect that the extent of lipid bilayer destabilization is highest in the plasma membrane as it is the first source of PE encountered by OPA."

The haploid insertion strategy outlined here is a powerful way to screen for small molecule targets by looking for gene inactivating mutants conferring resistance and it was nicely validated with topoisomerase inhibitors. It was also impressive that the three inactivated genes uncovered in promoting OPA resistance were all part of the PE biosynthetic pathway. Based on the literature and the tendency of OPA to undergo pyrrole formation with primary amines, the authors astutely postulated that PE could be interacting directly with OPA, and this was in fact observed. The authors also found that knockdown of the PE biosynthetic enzymes recapitulated the genetic screen findings about OPA resistance and that PE added exogenously could confer OPA resistance, presumably by titrating OPA out. Overall, this is a fascinating study with a very unusual proposed mechanism of action of a cytotoxic drug. However, it is believed that more compelling evidence is needed to support the conclusion that the PE reaction with OPA is the primary mechanism of action for OPA's cell killing."

As such, these mutant cells have only a 16-24% reduction in PE levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>), and any phenotype associated with this reduction is therefore likely to be mild. The modest reduction in PE levels was accompanied by a modest increase in the IC<sub>50</sub> of OPA from 43 nM in wild-type KBM7 cells to 70-85 nM in the mutants (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4a</a>). Based on the mechanism of the Paal-Knorr reaction, we surmise that the rate of covalent adduct formation is proportional to both the concentration of OPA and that of PE in the lipid bilayer. Accordingly, a modest reduction in PE levels (less than 2-fold reduction) translates into a modest decrease in the rate of deleterious adduct formation and thus a modest increase in OPA resistance (up to 2-fold). This slight increase in resistance manifests as a quantitatively detectable increase in proliferation rate of the mutants\u2019 cells upon OPA treatment in a sensitive, sequencing-based genetic screen output. We used these subtle changes found in the mutant cells to form a hypothesis about the identity of the direct molecular target of OPA in human cells."

We therefore believe that PE-OPA adduct formation is the main determinant of OPA cytotoxicity. We have edited the manuscript to clarify our interpretation of the genetic experiments."

Amarnath et al. also observed that the cyclization step is indeed influenced by the stereochemistry of the 1,4 diketone, and rates of pyrrole formation can be up to 57-fold different between stereoisomers (Amarnath et al., 1991).

To explain this data, we surmise that OPA reacts with the exogenously added PE in the growth medium and that the large majority of these adducts do not partition into the cell membrane, thereby reducing the number of OPA molecules available to partition into the cell membrane, react with endogenous PE, and induce cell death. Supporting this assertion is the fact that the solubility of PE in aqueous solutions is very low, and thus exogenous PE forms visible insoluble aggregates when added to cell culture medium. Thus, any OPA reacting with exogenously added PE will likely remain trapped in these aggregates as the PE-OPA adducts are themselves also very hydrophobic."

Excitingly, we observed that OPA treatment caused extensive liposome leakage, and that the leakage was directly proportional to the PE content of the liposomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Importantly, we observed that liposomes composed only of PC or with very low PE content remain intact even at high OPA concentration, indicating that the leakage is likely specifically due to the presence of PE-OPA adducts.
