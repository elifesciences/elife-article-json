Platelets use receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), specifically its \u03b1 subunit (GPIb\u03b1), to signal as they tether and translocate on von Willebrand factor (VWF) of injured arterial surfaces against blood flow. Force slows VWF-GPIb\u03b1 dissociation (catch bond) and unfolds the GPIb\u03b1 leucine-rich repeat domain (LRRD) and juxtamembrane mechanosensitive domain (MSD). How these mechanical processes trigger biochemical signals remains unknown. Here we analyze these extracellular events and the resulting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> on a single platelet in real time, revealing that LRRD unfolding intensifies the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal analogously whereas MSD unfolding determines the Ca<sup>2+</sup> type digitally. The &gt;30nm macroglycopeptide separating the two domains transmits VWF-GPIb\u03b1 bond lifetime prolonged by LRRD unfolding to enhance MSD unfolding cooperatively at an optimal force, which may serve as a design principle for a generic mechanosensory machine."
