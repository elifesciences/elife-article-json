Here we use cell-specific protein degradation and quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy in strains with a thick sporulation septum to investigate the architecture and function of the SpoIIIE DNA translocation complex in vivo. We were able to visualize SpoIIIE complexes with approximately equal numbers of molecules in the mother cell and the forespore. Cell-specific protein degradation showed that only the mother cell complex is required to translocate DNA into the forespore, whereas degradation in either cell reverses membrane fission. Our data suggest that SpoIIIE assembles a coaxially paired channel for each chromosome arm comprised of one hexamer in each cell to maintain membrane fission during DNA translocation. We show that SpoIIIE can operate, in principle, as a bi-directional motor that exports DNA."

Here we use cell-specific protein degradation and quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy in strains with a thick sporulation septum to investigate the architecture and function of the SpoIIIE DNA translocation complex in vivo. We were able to visualize SpoIIIE complexes with approximately equal numbers of molecules in the mother cell and the forespore. Cell-specific protein degradation showed that only the mother cell complex is required to translocate DNA into the forespore, whereas degradation in either cell reverses membrane fission. Our data suggest that SpoIIIE assembles a coaxially paired channel for each chromosome arm comprised of one hexamer in each cell to maintain membrane fission during DNA translocation. We show that SpoIIIE can operate, in principle, as a bi-directional motor that exports DNA."

A paradigmatic example is the segregation of chromosomes that are trapped in the septum during cell division, which requires specialized DNA translocases of the SpoIIIE/FtsK/HerA protein superfamily. The members of this superfamily use the energy of ATP to translocate DNA and peptides through membrane pores (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bath et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Iyer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tato et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burton and Dubnau, 2010</a>).

As the sporulation septum closes around the chromosome, SpoIIIE forms a stable focus at the septal midpoint (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wu and Errington, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>), where it mediates two key events. First, it keeps the mother cell and forespore septal membranes separated in the presence of a septum-trapped chromosome, playing an important role in septal membrane fission (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

This vectorial DNA translocation is dictated by the interaction of the \u03b3 domain with SpoIIIE recognition sequences (SRS) that are distributed in a skewed manner along the <i>B. subtilis</i> chromosome from the origin of replication towards the terminus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pease et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ptacin et al., 2008</a>).

Cell biological studies have shown that both arms of the circular chromosome are translocated simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib11\">Burton et al., 2007</a>), suggesting that the translocation complex is made of at least two SpoIIIE hexamers, one for each chromosome arm. However, it remains unclear how SpoIIIE is organized at the septum. One model is that DNA is translocated through an aqueous membrane pore (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wu and Errington, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fiche et al., 2013</a>). According to this model, the transmembrane domains of SpoIIIE simply localize the complex to the septum, and it has been proposed that tension generated during DNA translocation generates an asymmetric complex with hexameric motor domains oriented towards the mother cell cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fiche et al., 2013</a>). A second model proposes that SpoIIIE transmembrane domains in opposite septal membranes pair to form DNA-conducting channel that traverses both septal membranes, with the motor domains in the respective cytosols (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Burton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>).

We developed a cell-specific protein degradation system that selectively removes SpoIIIE from each cell after polar septation and used this system with GFP tagging and quantitative PALM (qPALM) to investigate SpoIIIE architecture and function. We show that SpoIIIE forms a complex with approximately equal numbers of molecules in the mother cell and the forespore, enough to assemble at least two hexamers in each cell. Both the forespore and mother cell SpoIIIE subcomplexes are required to maintain septal membrane fission during DNA translocation. However, only the mother cell SpoIIIE is essential for chromosome translocation into the forespore. In the absence of the mother cell protein, forespore SpoIIIE translocates the chromosome out of the forespore, indicating that SpoIIIE exports DNA. Together our results are consistent with the paired channel model in which SpoIIIE assembles a DNA-conducting channel that spans the mother cell and forespore septal membranes. Moreover, we show that SpoIIIE can operate, in principle, as a bi-directional motor that exports DNA from a given cell compartment."

To achieve cell-specific degradation of SsrA*-tagged proteins during sporulation, we expressed <i>sspB</i><sup><i>Ec</i></sup> in a cell-specific manner by using promoters (P<sub><i>spoIIQ</i></sub> and P<sub><i>spoIID</i></sub>) dependent on the sigma factors \u03c3<sup>F</sup> and \u03c3<sup>E</sup>, which become active only in the forespore or in the mother cell, respectively, immediately after polar septation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Clarke et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rong et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Londo\u00f1o-Vallejo et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sharp and Pogliano, 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

To estimate the degradation kinetics, we correlated loss of the GFP signal with the stages of engulfment, a phagocytosis like process that occurs during DNA translocation. Immediately after polar septation, the septum is first flat, then curved, and finally the mother cell membrane engulfs the forespore (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Quantification of GFP fluorescence intensity showed that the protein was lost at similar rates in the cell expressing <i>sspB</i><sup><i>Ec</i></sup> (forespore or mother cell) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). In both cases, the fluorescence decreased close to zero when sporangia entered engulfment, indicating that most GyrA-GFP-SsrA* was degraded at this sporulation stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Similar results were obtained after cell-specific degradation of a \u03c3<sup>A</sup>-GFP-SsrA* fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

If SpoIIIE assembles in one cell, then triggering degradation in that cell would cause the focus to disappear, while triggering degradation in the other cell would have no effect. However, if the translocation complex is present in both cells, then degradation in only one cell would leave SpoIIIE monomers in the other cell, and the focus would be expected to persist until SpoIIIE was degraded in both cells simultaneously. The SpoIIIE-GFP-SsrA* fusion protein, as expected, formed a bright focus at the septal midpoint and persisted around the forespore during engulfment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). When SpoIIIE was degraded in either cell, more than 80% of the sporangia still contained a SpoIIIE focus. However, when SpoIIIE was degraded in both cells simultaneously just 25% of sporangia retained a focus, and these were faint and present only in sporangia with flat and curved septa (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), which are at early stages of sporulation."

However, examination of PALM images revealed mainly single foci (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fiche et al., 2013</a>). Most likely this observation reflects the fact that the distance between the forespore and mother cell membranes at the septum is just \u223c20 nm (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tocheva et al., 2013</a>), which is close to the limit of resolution via PALM (\u223c25 nm). Consistent with this idea, occasionally we observed sporangia with what appear to be two clusters of molecules aligned across the septum (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, right column). To improve the ability to resolve these two subcomplexes, we used a <i>B. subtilis</i> mutant that retains thick septal peptidoglycan because it lacks the mother cell transcription factor (\u03c3<sup>E</sup>) that controls septal thinning, the first step in engulfment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In this \u0394\u03c3<sup>E</sup> strain, the distance between the mother cell and forespore septal membranes is \u223c40 nm, more than twice the distance of wild type (<a href=\"#bib25\">Illing and Errington, 1991</a>), potentially allowing resolution of the SpoIIIE subcomplexes in each cell by PALM. We therefore introduced SpoIIIE-tdEOS into the \u0394\u03c3<sup>E</sup> strain. As expected (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pogliano et al., 1999</a>), this strain did not initiate engulfment or block the second potential division septum, producing a high number of disporic sporangia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) without impairing DNA translocation (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

In contrast to the \u0394\u03c3<sup>E</sup> mutant, the completion of the second polar septum is inhibited in the <i>spoIIDMP</i> triple mutant, leading to the formation of fewer disporic sporangia. This feature allows the estimation of the degree of chromosome translocation using DNA-specific dyes and measuring the dye-intensity in the forespore vs the total intensity (forespore plus mother cell), a standard procedure in the field (<a href=\"#bib5\">Becker and Pogliano, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ptacin et al., 2008</a>). The relative forespore DAPI intensity of sporangia showing dual foci in the <i>spoIIDMP</i> mutant ranged between 0.1 and 0.32, suggesting that they were actively translocating DNA. These observations suggest that dual foci represent the organization of the SpoIIIE complex during the process of DNA translocation.

On average, the width perpendicular to the septum of the single foci (94 nm) was \u223c1.7\u00d7 larger than that of each individually resolved cluster in dual foci (54 nm), while their width parallel to the septum was similar (\u223c80 nm, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting that single foci are unresolved dual foci.

This strain showed dual foci in 23% of septa (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), suggesting that dual foci represent the structure of SpoIIIE when it assembles around the trapped chromosome, not after DNA translocation. Second, we used PALM to localize wild type SpoIIIE-tdEOS in \u0394SpoIIDMP strain in sporangia stained with both the membrane stain FM5-95 and the DNA stain DAPI, so we could discriminate between cells in which DNA translocation was ongoing and those in which it was complete. Quantification of the forespore DNA relative to the total (mother cell plus forespore), demonstrated that 81% of sporangia with dual foci had not completed DNA translocation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>).

During sporulation, septal membrane fission occurs in the presence of a trapped chromosome (<a href=\"#bib11\">Burton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>) and depends on the assembly of a stable SpoIIIE translocation complex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>). It has been proposed that SpoIIIE mediates membrane fission by assembling a paired channel spanning both septal membranes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>), with both halves of the channel required to mediate and maintain septal membrane fission. To test this hypothesis, we used cell-specific SpoIIIE degradation together with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to assess the continuity of the forespore and mother cell membranes after degrading SpoIIIE in one or the other cell. Briefly, sporangia were stained with the membrane dye FM4-64 and the dye in the forespore photobleached with a laser. If the membrane of the mother cell and the forespore are connected to form a continuous unit, FM4-64 will diffuse from the mother cell to the forespore and fluorescence will completely recover (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, right). However, if the membranes are separated and physically disjointed, FM4-64 will not diffuse and forespore fluorescence will not recover (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, left)."

Since the <i>CFP</i> gene is expressed from a \u03c3<sup>F</sup>-dependent promoter, it will not be transcribed until it reaches the forespore. Therefore, we can use the presence of CFP in the forespore as an indicator that chromosome translocation has been completed (II). If chromosome translocation is impaired and the <i>cfp</i> gene does not reach the forespore, no CFP signal will be detected (III). (<b>B</b>) Deconvolution fluorescence microscopy of sporangia containing <i>cfp</i> under the control of <i>spoIIQ</i> promoter inserted in the <i>cotC</i> locus, in strains in which SpoIIIE is not degraded (JLG981), degraded in the forespore (JLG1001), degraded in the mother cell (JLG1002) or degraded in both (JLG1003). When SpoIIIE is not degraded or degraded only in the forespore most sporangia show CFP signal in the forespore, indicating that translocation has been completed. However, when SpoIIIE is degraded in the mother cell or in both the forespore and mother cell simultaneously, many sporangia in late stages of engulfment do not show CFP signal in the forespore (arrowheads), indicating that chromosome translocation is not completed.

We used the SpoIIIE-GFP-SsrA* cell-specific degradation strains and quantified the amount of DAPI-stained DNA in the forespore relative to the total DNA in sporangia that were about to complete engulfment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib5\">Becker and Pogliano, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ptacin et al., 2008</a>), when chromosome translocation is completed the normalized forespore DAPI intensity is just \u223c30\u201340% (of the total DNA) rather than the expected 50% (one full chromosome in the forespore and the other in the mother cell), likely due to self-quenching of DAPI in the smaller volume of the forespore. In the SpoIIIE<sup>ATP\u2212</sup> mutant, where chromosome translocation is blocked, and before DNA translocation starts in the wild type, the normalized forespore DAPI intensity is 10\u201315% (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Without degradation, most sporangia finished chromosome translocation before the completion of engulfment showing an average normalized forespore DAPI intensity of 37% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Similarly, when SpoIIIE was degraded in the forespore, most sporangia completed chromosome translocation (normalized DAPI intensity, 38%). However, 26% of sporangia showed a normalized DAPI intensity &lt;30% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting that in some sporangia the absence of the forespore complex impaired the ability of the mother cell complex to translocate DNA. In contrast, degradation of SpoIIIE in the mother cell blocked chromosome translocation (normalized DAPI intensity, 20%) in most sporangia and 20% of sporangia showed anucleate forespores (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), indicating that in the absence of the SpoIIIE mother cell subcomplex, the forespore subcomplex can ultimately translocate the chromosome in the reverse direction. As expected, degradation in both cells blocked chromosome translocation (normalized DAPI intensity, 21%) and generated 6% anucleate forespores, less than when SpoIIIE was degraded only in the mother cell (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Expresison of <i>sspB</i><sup><i>Ec</i></sup> in strains in which SpoIIIE was not tagged with SsrA* did not show any defect in chromosome translocation, indicating that the observed phenotypes are indeed due to the degradation of SpoIIIE molecules (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results support the notion that SpoIIIE functions as a DNA exporter (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sharp and Pogliano, 2002</a>), and that although it normally operates in the mother cell, it is capable of operating in the forespore in the absence of the mother cell subcomplex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), generating anucleate forespores. Surprisingly, our results also provide evidence that the forespore subcomplex is necessary for maximal DNA translocation efficiency, a result confirmed by quantifying the frequency with which a CFP reporter of forespore gene expression that was positioned near the terminus entered the forespore (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We were able to directly visualize the assembly of SpoIIIE into two subcomplexes consisting of subunits in each daughter cell. Cell-specific protein degradation and qPALM were used to determine the relative abundance of SpoIIIE in each daughter cell, and our results indicate that each contain approximately equal numbers of SpoIIIE molecules. These observations support a model in which each chromosome arm is transported through a paired channel that spans two lipid bilayers (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Burton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>). The distance between the clusters in each cell was found to be 55 nm, which is larger than the 40 nm width of the septum in the strains used here, providing some support for a channel architecture in which the motor domains of each complex are within the cytoplasm of the respective daughter cell (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, left) rather than within the septum (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, right), although further experiments are required to address this point."

Our results indicate that the translocation channel has approximately equal numbers of SpoIIIE motor domains in each cell, consistent with the models shown in <b>B</b>, but not with the simple aqueous channel model in <b>A</b>. They further indicate that the SpoIIIE membrane domains are arranged in such a way that they form a continuous protein barrier at the septum that blocks diffusion within the lipid bilayer and that molecules in each cell are required to form this barrier. We envision two alternative organizations to achieve this. First, the transmembrane domains might form channels in each septal membrane that interact within the septal space and conduct the DNA across the septum, with the motor domains projecting into the cytoplasm (left). Second, the transmembrane domains might form a contiguous external ring that blocks lipid diffusion, with motor domains projecting towards the lumen of an aqueous channel (right). The distance between the centers of the forespore and mother cell clusters (55 nm) is larger than the thickness of the septum (40 nm, <a href=\"#bib44\">Tocheva et al., 2013</a>) leading us to prefer the paired channel model (left). (<b>C</b>) Each chromosome arm is translocated by a different SpoIIIE channel that is comprised of opposing motor domains that have the ability to export DNA from their respective cell. Translocation directionality is established by the interaction between SRS and the SpoIIIE \u03b3 domain, which activates the mother cell motor (green), and inactivates the forespore motor (grey). Consequently, the mother cell-SpoIIIE exports DNA until the final loop (<i>ter</i>) reaches the septum. We propose that translocation of the loop generates tension that destabilizes and opens the channels forming a larger pore to pass the loop."

However, it is important to note that imaging live rather than fixed cells would likely overestimate the dimensions of the complex if SpoIIIE moves during DNA translocation, which could explain why the measured width of the foci (80 nm) is wider than expected for two side by side hexamers (\u223c24 nm). Furthermore, the spatial resolution of PALM (\u223c25 nm) remains significantly larger than the size of most macromolecular assemblies, and it is larger than the distance between the two faces of the septum in wild type cells (\u223c20 nm). We partially overcame the current limitations of PALM by using two genetic tools, the thick septum mutant which increased the distance between the subcomplexes in each cell, and cell-specific protein degradation which improved our ability to discriminate between molecules in each cell."

Although our qPALM approach balances the over- and undercounting errors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2012</a>), the numbers of SpoIIIE molecules determined here may represent a lower bound to their true number if some of the photoactivatable fusion domains did not fold properly at the foci. Nevertheless, it is tantalizing to note that our counting method (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2012</a>) indicated that the SpoIIIE complex contains 31 (\u00b118) SpoIIIE molecules, enough to form at least two dodecameric channels, one for each chromosome arm (24 molecules in total, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of qPALM data revealed the existence of two populations of sporangia with different numbers of SpoIIIE monomers at the septum (\u223c25 and \u223c50; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that some translocation complexes have enough molecules to assemble two channels while others could assemble four (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, we speculate that SpoIIIE organizes around an even number of DNA arms (two or four) during sporulation (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), as would be expected if a circular chromosome crossed the septum one or two times, respectively."

Our results demonstrate that SpoIIIE is required in both cells to maintain separate septal membranes during DNA translocation and that septal membrane fission is reversible in the presence of trapped DNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The simplest explanation for this finding is that transmembrane domains in each cell assemble a structure that excludes lipids and blocks membrane diffusion between the two cells. This scenario could occur if during assembly of a translocation complex, SpoIIIE membrane domains in the mother cell and the forespore dock via their extracellular domains and the membrane domains of each subunit\u2014within each bilayer\u2014compact into their hexameric form, excluding lipids to form a paired central channel (<a href=\"#bib2\">Almers, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Peters et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>). It is possible that docking is indirect and requires additional, accessory proteins that connect the extracellular domains of SpoIIIE. In addition to the data presented here, the paired channel model for septal membrane fission is supported by our previous demonstration that septal membrane fission depends on the SpoIIIE transmembrane domain (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sharp and Pogliano, 2003</a>) and its large extracellular loop (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2006</a>) and on the assembly of a compact focus (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>)."

While the assembly of SpoIIIE in both sides of the septum provides a structural scaffold for membrane fission, it poses a topological challenge for directional chromosome translocation. Prior to the establishment of directional DNA translocation, both complexes could, in principle, export DNA out of its respective compartment (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sharp and Pogliano, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Becker and Pogliano, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ptacin et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), leading to a potential clash between complexes in each cell; as a result, these complexes would compete to translocate DNA either out of or into the forespore. However, our cell-specific degradation data show that chromosome translocation happens most efficiently when both complexes are present (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that rather than a competition, there is a potentiation between the two hexamers of a channel. We therefore propose that the hexamers within a dodecameric channel should be considered as an integral entity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). In this model, docking of the transmembrane domains of hexamers in opposite septal membranes might contribute to the robustness of chromosome translocation in two ways. First, it might stabilize the translocation complex, distributing the tension produced by the movement of the chromosome between the two septal membranes and insulating the DNA from interactions with the membrane or periplasm. Second, it might facilitate the deactivation of the forespore motor domains after activation of the mother cell motor domains by encountering SRSs in the permissive orientation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Besprozvannaya et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cattoni et al., 2013</a>)."

Since the trapped chromosome can belong to either daughter cell, a paired channel similar to the one described here could function as a bidirectional translocation machinery guided by SRS-like sequences that would allow the transport of the chromosome to the appropriate compartment. So, by analogy to SpoIIIE, we hypothesize that the transmembrane domain of these proteins might also form a paired channel crossing both septal membranes."

Thus, even though in some cases the clusters could be seen as distinct, they were not included in our analysis if they appeared physically connected in the PALM image. To formalize the identification, we employed the Rayleigh resolution criterion. We used the fact that the average width (four times the standard deviation) in perpendicular direction to the septum of the forespore- and mother cell-proximal cluster from dual-foci was 57 nm and 52 nm, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Accordingly, dual foci were identified as such if the distance between the peaks of the individual foci were at least 39 nm or more. It should be pointed out that 94% of the measured distance between these adjacent two clusters are larger than the Rayleigh criteria as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>."

The fluorescence recovery, D to A, was well explained by two different rates (<i>k</i><sub><i>r</i>1</sub> and <i>k</i><sub><i>r</i>2</sub>) with their population ratio (<i>\u03b1</i>), which implies the existence of at least two dark states. The photoactivation rate <i>k</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> can be externally changed by the intensity of UV light whereas all the other rates are constants fixed by the intrinsic molecular properties of Dendra2. In order to optimize the temporal separation of molecules we changed <i>k</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> in time such that a Dendra2 molecule gets photoactivated during a given experimental time, <i>t</i><sub><i>F</i></sub>, with an almost uniform probability distribution. To account for the overcounting error induced by multiple transitions between the state A and the state D, we introduced a tolerance time of the dwell in the dark states, <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>: if the fluorescence at the same location recovers within a given <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> then the two events are considered due to a blink of an identical Dendra2 molecule rather than due to two independent photoactivation events of two different molecules. However, the introduction of <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> also induces molecular undercounting error because it is probabilistically not impossible that two different Dendra2 molecules actually get photoactivated one after the other within a time interval shorter than the given value of <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>."

Basically, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) treats the data by a mixture of multiple Gaussian components. Then, one can fit the GMM model distribution directly to the data without resorting to a histogram or GKDE curve using various methods; among these the simplest is the maximum likelihood method. However, the downside of the maximum likelihood method is that it cannot uniquely determine the number of Gaussian components\u2014denoted by \u2018K\u2019 henceforth\u2014due to the problem of overfitting data. Therefore, the maximum likelihood method is not ideal because it relies on a manual input of \u2018K\u2019 that is predetermined in a subjective and heuristic manner. In contrast, the VBGMM is a Bayesian approach in which the model parameters, such as the mean and the standard deviation of a Gaussian component, are regarded as random variables. The probability distribution of the model parameters, defined as a \u2018posterior\u2019 distribution, is then marginalized and optimized to determine the \u2018K\u2019 value in the VBGMM method (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bishop, 2006</a>). VBGMM determines the optimal \u2018K\u2019 that best explains the data without the problem of overfitting. VBGMM automatically takes care of the problem of overfitting within its self-contained statistical framework. This Bayesian approach has been proved to be very successful in objectively determining the number of states from single-molecule FRET data (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bronson et al., 2009</a>)."

The spatial organization of this protein has been the subject of studies over the past few years, and the authors provide convincing data in support of a clear model for the spatial organization of this protein at the septum. They showed that SpoIIIE in the septum are present on both the mother cell side and the forespore side, and both sides are needed for the cell fission. They further showed that the SpoIIIE complex functions to export the DNA out of the cell, and only the SpoIIIE complex on the mother cell side is required for the translocation of the DNA into the forespore. Interestingly, the complexes on the two sides do not compete with each other, but cooperate for efficient DNA segregation. The results presented in this manuscript are novel, important and beautiful. Both the Reviewing editor and the other reviewer recommend the publication of this work in <i>eLife</i> with only minor revisions."

The label efficiency is much less of an issue in PALM because the labels are genetically encoded, and we used western blots to confirm that 100% of the SpoIIIE molecules were fused to PA-FPs, Dendra2 or tdEOS (Supplementary file 2). However, it is possible to imagine that some of the PA-FP domains may not have folded properly and so may remain dark.

We have attempted to address this point by performing time-lapse microscopy of individual sporangia, but our results have been compromised by phototoxicity (to which sporulating cells appear particularly sensitive) and GFP photobleaching. In the absence of solid timelapse data, we were left with the option of classifying sporangia according to the different engulfment stages that can be unambiguously distinguished using membrane dyes. We here used the five stages of engulfment that are used for this purpose (Sharp and Pogliano, 1999), although we did not include the two final stages, since at this point, degradation is complete. The addition of intermediate stages based simply on visual screening would be subjective. Nevertheless, we are continuing to develop the cell-specific degradation system, and a key priority is to improve the temporal resolution."

Unfortunately, we do not have any direct method to decouple the different sources of the dispersion in the results. However, here we will try to do a back-of-the-envelope calculation according to our previous work based on the in vitro characterization of Dendra2 photophysics, where we demonstrated that the counting error depended on the number of molecules and the length of the experiment (Figure S8, Lee et al. 2012). We estimate that the molecular counting error contributes 3 and 2 monomers for populations peaked at \u223c19 and \u223c15, respectively (Figure 5D center and right), which is smaller than the standard deviation of the measured distribution (11 and 8). Then, the remaining standard deviation (after eliminating the contribution of the counting error), 10 and 7, should correspond to the inherent variation of the biological structure. This suggests that most of the variability in the number of monomers is due to biological variation in the stoichiometry of the SpoIIIE complex rather than counting errors, and that it would not be possible to narrow the variance by just lowering the counting uncertainty."

Nonetheless, the contribution of these two sources of stochastic variation will necessarily add when estimating the variance of the distribution. Thus, we have more confidence in the first than in the second moment of the distribution."
