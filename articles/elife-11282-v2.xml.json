To quantify such complex evolutionary dynamics in vivo, time resolved and genome wide data including rare variants are essential. We performed whole-genome deep sequencing of HIV-1 populations in 9 untreated patients, with 6-12 longitudinal samples per patient spanning 5-8 years of infection. The data can be accessed and explored via an interactive web application. We show that patterns of minor diversity are reproducible between patients and mirror global HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a universal landscape of fitness costs that control diversity. Reversions towards the ancestral HIV-1 sequence are observed throughout infection and account for almost one third of all sequence changes. Reversion rates depend strongly on conservation. Frequent recombination limits linkage disequilibrium to about 100bp in most of the genome, but strong hitch-hiking due to short range linkage limits diversity."

To quantify such complex evolutionary dynamics in vivo, time resolved and genome wide data including rare variants are essential. We performed whole-genome deep sequencing of HIV-1 populations in 9 untreated patients, with 6-12 longitudinal samples per patient spanning 5-8 years of infection. The data can be accessed and explored via an interactive web application. We show that patterns of minor diversity are reproducible between patients and mirror global HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a universal landscape of fitness costs that control diversity. Reversions towards the ancestral HIV-1 sequence are observed throughout infection and account for almost one third of all sequence changes. Reversion rates depend strongly on conservation. Frequent recombination limits linkage disequilibrium to about 100bp in most of the genome, but strong hitch-hiking due to short range linkage limits diversity."

We then analyze the intrapatient evolution of HIV-1 and show that the minor variants in the virus population explore sequence space in predictable fashion at the single site level. At the same time, we observe a strong tendency for reversion towards the global HIV-1 consensus that is not limited to early infection but occurs at an approximately constant rate throughout chronic infection. Reversion is more frequent at sites that are more conserved at the global level, suggesting a direct relationship between intrapatient fitness cost and global conservation. Together with reproducible patterns of intrapatient variation, this link explains why HIV-1 fitness landscapes can be inferred from cross-sectional data (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dahirel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ferguson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mann et al., 2014</a>). We further find frequent recombination, which allows the viral population to evolve independently in different regions of the genome. Nevertheless, recombination is not frequent enough to decouple mutations closer than 100 base pairs and we observe signatures of hitch-hiking at short distances (<a href=\"#bib81\">Maynard Smith and Haigh, 1974</a>)."

Data from two additional patients (p4 and p7) were excluded from analysis because of suspected superinfection and failure to amplify early samples with low virus levels, respectively. The patients were selected to have a relatively well-defined time of infection and to have been treatment-naive for a minimum of 5 years. Patients diagnosed in recent years rarely fulfill these inclusion criteria because therapy is almost universally recommended, but this was not the case when the study patients were diagnosed. Basic characteristics of the patients are presented in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Additional data on the patients are presented in <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. All patients progressed to moderate-to-severe immunosuppression during the study period. The final CD4 count within the study period for patients 1\u20133, 5\u20136 and 8\u201311 were 340, 369, 140, 228, 287, 378, 158, 200 and 251, respectively. Of the nine patients, eight were males, seven were men who have sex with men (MSM), two were heterosexually infected (HET), and eight were infected in Sweden. The method to estimate the date of infection (EDI) is described in Materials and methods. We retrieved longitudinal biobank plasma samples covering the time period from early infection (time since EDI 33\u2013209 days) until end of study follow-up, which usually coincided with start of antiretroviral therapy (time since EDI 5.5\u20138.3 years). The number of samples per patient ranged between 6 and 12 and, in total, we investigated 73 samples. The median plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 12,000 copies/ml for the samples with available data on RNA levels. Some samples had low RNA levels, which partly is explained by the study design that required that the patients were treatment-naive for at least 5 years.

Frequency estimates were often reproducible to within a few percent. Sometimes, however, variant recovery was poor (mostly in fragment 5) and frequency estimates less accurate.

In two patients, p3 and p10, the first sample displayed diversity consistent with the transmission of several variants from the same donor, see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. For each of the nine patients, we reconstructed the HIV-1 genome sequence of the first sample by an iterative mapping procedure described in Materials and methods. We use this initial consensus sequence to approximate the sequence of the transmitted founder virus(es). Our first sample is estimated to be between 1 and 7 months into infection and a few mutations (likely CTL escape mutations) had probably spread through the viral population by that time. Thus, the initial consensus sequence probably will differ slightly from the true founder virus. The number of differences, however, will be small compared to the sequence divergence in the 5 or more years of follow-up such that this initial consensus sequence is a useful approximation of the founder virus(es)."

We classified nucleotide positions in the genome into four categories ranging from highly conserved positions to less conserved positions within group M (Q1\u2013Q4) using the same alignment as above. Next we asked what fraction of sites within these categories show intrapatient variation at a level of at least 1%. For the least conserved positions, this fraction increased steadily to about 20% after 8 years, while less than 1% of the most conserved sites shows variation above the 1% level. This latter fraction rapidly saturates and does not increase over time. Since variant amplification, sequencing and variant calling does not use any information on cross-sectional conservations, the absence of variation above 1% at conserved sites is further evidence that our amplification and sequencing pipeline does not generate spurious variation. Other thresholds yield similar results."

We then asked whether we observed more nonsynonymous substitutions in epitopes predicted to be targeted than expected by chance (excluding the variable loops of gp120 and the external part of gp41, see Materials and methods). We found a significant enrichment by a factor 1.9 in the putatively targeted region (p-value &lt;3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>), corresponding to 5.5 excess nonsynonymous substitutions, whereby the total number of nonsynonymous substitutions per patient is on average 43 (median, quartiles 36\u201364).

Our reasoning proceeds as follows. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> indicates that diversity accumulates over a time frame of 2\u20134 years, i.e., about 1000 days. Recombination at a rate of 10<sup>\u22125</sup>/<i>bp</i>/<i>day</i> hits a genome on average every 100 bps in 1000 days. Mutations further apart than 100 bps are hence often separated by recombination and retain little linkage consistent with the observed decay length in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. The longer linkage in fragment 5 (env) might have several reasons that extend beyond our simple argument: (i) homologous recombination might be suppressed in the most variable regions, (ii) the accuracy of SNP frequency estimates is lower in F5 due to poorer amplification, and (iii) the rapid evolution of env due frequent substitutions and sweeps gives less time to break up linkage. In particular, as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, frequent and strong selective sweeps affect synonymous diversity in physical proximity along the genome, confirming the presence of linkage at short distances."

We find that, during the infection, HIV-1 explores the sequence space surrounding the founder virus systematically; similar mutational patterns are observed within different, unrelated patients. Linkage between mutations is limited to approximately 100 bp, so the virus population can accumulate substitutions independently in different regions of the genome as suggested by theoretical models (<a href=\"#bib56\">Mostowy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Rouzine and Coffin, 2005</a>). Nonetheless, local dynamics of SNPs is often dominated by hitch-hiking between neighboring mutations, resulting in an anticorrelation between nonsynonymous divergence and synonymous diversity. A large fraction of all substitutions are reversions towards the global HIV-1 consensus sequence, and these reversions steadily accumulate throughout infection."

This tendency to revert increases with the level of conservation of the site, suggesting a quantitative relationship between fitness cost and conservation.

On longer distances, this simple argument will have to be modified due to compensatory mutations resulting in gradual shift of the preferred state at some positions; nonetheless, it indicates a dramatic slowing down of divergence at a scale of the HIV-1-SIVcpz divergence. This apparent deceleration of evolution could explain the contradictory findings of attempts to date the age of HIV-1 and SIV (<a href=\"#bib85\">Worobey et al., 2010</a>).

It is, for example, possible to select an arbitrary region of the genome with length &lt;500 bp, such as the frequently investigated V3 region, and extract an alignment of haplotypes covering this region along with their frequency from all time points belonging to one patient.

In HIV-1, this process is facilitated by frequent recombination.

Properties of linkage between mutation will differ since mechanisms of recombination are diverse.

This allowed sequencing of nucleotide positions 571\u20139567 in the HxB2 reference sequence according to the Sequence Locator Tool available at <a href=\"www.hiv.lanl.gov\">www.hiv.lanl.gov</a>. Because of the redundancy of the long terminal repeats (LTRs), this means that all genomic regions except positions 482-571 in the R region of the LTRs were sequenced. Primer design was performed using the subtype reference alignment and the PrimerDesign software available at <a href=\"www.hiv.lanl.gov\">www.hiv.lanl.gov</a> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brodin et al., 2013</a>). PrimerDesign was used to find candidate forward and reverse primers targeting highly conserved regions of the HIV genome, with similar melting temperatures, and with minimal tendency for hairpin and primer-dimer formation. Candidate primers were manually adjusted if needed, tested and sometimes redesigned. For each genome fragment, both outer PCR primers and nested, inner primers were designed; inner primers were only used for template quantification and internal testing purposes. Alternative primer sets were created for genome fragments F3 and F5 because the PCRs with the original primers sometimes were inefficient. For fragment F5, the amplification problem was not completely alleviated despite trials with several different primer pairs. We believe that this might be be due to the extensive secondary structure in the RRE region. The primers are presented in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. All primer positions except the 5\u2019 primer of F1 and the 3\u2019 primer of F6 are contained in neighboring amplicons and hence sequenced. The primer part of the reads itself was trimmed after sequencing (see below)."

We favored this pipeline over existing programs because HIV-1 is a diverse species and both coverage and genetic diversity typically fluctuate by many orders of magnitude across the genome. The pipeline works as follows: (i) reads were mapped onto the HIV-1 reference HxB2, using the probabilistic mapper Stampy (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lunter and Goodson, 2011</a>); (ii) mapped reads were classified into one of the six overlapping fragments used for RT-PCR (ambiguous and chimeric reads were discarded), and trimmed for PHRED quality above or equal 30 except for one isolated position per read; RT-PCR primers were also trimmed at this step; (iii) a consensus sequence was computed for each fragment in each sample from a subset of the reads, using a chain of overlapping local multiple sequence alignments (each covering around 150 bp); (iv) the reads were re-mapped, this time against their own consensus; (vii) genetic distance from the consensus were computed, and reads with a distance higher than a sample- and fragment-specific threshold were discarded. Each threshold, calculated to exclude even traces of cross-contamination that might have happened during RNA extraction, PCR amplification, or library preparation, was established by plotting the distribution of Hamming distances of reads from the sample consensus, and excluding reads that are further away than the tail of the main peak. Contaminations appeared as a second peak at higher distances, recombinants as a fat tail: both were excluded. Reads were also trimmed for mapping errors at the edges (small indels); (viii) filtered reads were mapped a third time against a patient-specific reference that was as similar as possible to the consensus sequence from the earliest time point; (ix) reads were re-filtered and checked again for cross-contamination. The tree of minor variants of all patients in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> shows the absence of cross-contamination. The pipeline was equipped with extensive consistency checks for base quality, mapping errors, and contamination, and is based on the open source projects numpy (<a href=\"#bib83\">van der Walt et al., 2011</a>), matplotlib (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hunter, 2007</a>), Biopython (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cock et al., 2009</a>), samtools (<a href=\"#bib46\">Li et al., 2009</a>), pandas (<a href=\"#bib53\">McKinney, 2011</a>), and SeqAn (<a href=\"#bib17\">D\u00f6ring et al., 2008</a>)."

SNP calls were calculated from the reads using a custom pile-up restricted to reads with a PHRED quality &gt;=30 corresponding to a minimal theoretical error rate of 0.1% per base.

After quality filtering, PCR and sequencing errors never exceed 0.3% of reads covering a particular position. Hence SNPs found in more than 0.3% of all reads likely represent biological variation. It is noteworthy that this neither implies that we detect all biological variants at frequencies above 0.3% nor does the frequency of a SNP among the reads necessarily reflect the frequency of that SNP in the sample. For many samples, the detection limit and accuracy of quantification of minor variants was not limited by the sequencing error, but by the RNA template input and potential PCR bias."

Tests were done in duplicate on the same plate as amplifications for sequencing and the amplicons were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Templates numbers were estimated based on the assumption of Poisson sampling. Thus, for each sample, this dilution series provides an estimate of the number of templates that make it into the sequencing library. The results from the limiting dilution experiments correlated well (rank correlation p = 0.7) with routine plasma HIV-1 RNA level measurements that had been performed at time of sampling, see <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>. These comparisons showed that the median template cDN recovery efficiency was 30% (quartiles 17\u201360%), which should be regarded as satisfactory since the amplicons were relatively long and the samples had been stored for up to 24 years and sometimes also freeze-thawed prior to this study."

The estimates from the dilutions are typically a factor of three below the expectation from viral load, suggesting generally good template recovery. The center panel show the correlation of fragment-specific effective template numbers estimated from the concordance of SNPs in fragment overlaps. Again, the correlation is generally good, but fragment F5 often has estimates lower than those from the dilution series consistent with problems faced in amplification of this fragment. Information from fragment F6 is largely absent, since there is very little variation in the F5\u2013F6 overlap. The right panel plots SNP frequencies in overlaps measured in the leading fragment against the trailing fragment. Deviations from the diagonal are due PCR bias and random sampling from limited template molecules.

Furthermore, the agreement of SNP frequencies in the overlaps indicate that the primers were well-designed and did not induce significant primer-related PCR amplification biases. These fragment-specific estimates are only available for samples and fragments with sufficient diversity in the overlap regions and are often lacking for early samples and fragment F6.

All available fragment specific estimates are shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>. In addition to lack of concordance of SNP frequencies in overlaps, problematic fragments lack diversity or have a granular distribution of SNP frequencies such that they can be flagged and removed from specific analysis. The fact that PCR efficiency can vary within one sample is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a> that compares SNP frequencies estimated in samples 4 and 5 of patient 1 that are only 30 days apart: While SNP frequencies agree to within expectation for five out of six fragments; fragment F5 shows strong deviations linked to suboptimal PCR efficiency. However, even in problematic samples, our amplification and sequencing approach does not generate spurious variation, as shown by the absence of diversity in early samples or conserved sites (see below)."

However, cDNA synthesis and PCR have both the potential to generate in vitro recombination, and true biological linkage is preserved only if the frequency of in vitro recombination is low. To estimate the in vitro recombination in our experimental setup, virions from two subtype B HIV isolates, LAI III and 38304 (the latter obtained from a Swedish HIV-1 patient infected in Brazil), were mixed in equal concentrations. Aliquots of this mix (approximately 1250 RNA molecules per PCR fragment) were amplified with the six overlapping one-step RT-PCRs as described above in both single and nested PCR mode and then sequenced."

Consistently, we observe no PCR recombination within the first PCR (which starting at low template input does not saturate), while we observe substantial PCR recombination during a second nested PCR. Since our library preparation protocol requires very low input DNA, we do not need nested PCR, avoiding this source of PCR recombination. The fact that PCR recombination occurs during a second PCR shows that the two viruses used for this control (both subtype B) are similar enough that divergence does not interfere with heteroduplex formation. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> includes the linkage disequilibrium observed in the control experiment as a function of distance, showing that linkage is high and not lost with distance during the first PCR."

For the CTL epitope prediction, ranked epitope lists were obtained using the web service MHCi ( <a href=\"http://tools.immuneepitope.org/mhci\">tools.immuneepitope.org/mhci</a>). This tool uses several prediction methods ranked based on previously observed performance: Consensus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Moutaftsi et al., 2006</a>) &gt; Artificial Neural Network (<a href=\"#bib61\">Nielsen et al., 2003</a>) &gt; Stabilized Matrix Method (<a href=\"#bib66\">Peters and Sette, 2005</a>) &gt; NetMHCpan (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hoof et al., 2008</a>). For each patient, we submitted the consensus amino acid sequences of the viral proteins at the first time point together with 4-digit HLA types at MHC-I. To analyze putative CTL escape in our patients, we used the first 80 epitopes from the ranked list as a compromise between false negatives and false positives. This number maximized the statistical signature for HIV-1 substitutions being within epitopes, but similar results were obtained by taking the first 50-100 epitopes in the lists."

Another major strength is that you develop a web-based visualization platform that enables both expert and non-expert users to inspect the results in detail.

SNP frequencies are not expected to be accurate below 1/N where N is the number of template molecules, and N appears to be about 10 to 50. This would suggest that the SNP frequencies are not very accurate below about 2-10%. This idea seems to be consistent with the results in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, which show a very strong correlation between frequencies called from different fragments at moderate frequencies, but little correlation below about 1-5%. Although you do discuss this point to some degree, we think this point should be noted more emphatically. There is a great deal of interest in more accurate techniques for sequencing viruses, but as the results here make clear, there isn't really much benefit in improving sequencing accuracy if the accuracy is already &gt; 1/N."

For instance, in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a> it is unclear if the trends are for nucleotide or amino-acid mutations \u2013 this should be clarified, and ideally results for both nucleotides and amino acids could be shown. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> might also benefit from showing similar data for both nucleotides and amino acids. In the Discussion you note, \"The strong and lasting preference for specific nucleotides needs to be accounted for\u2026\".

However, something that is unclear from this comparison is whether variation is increasing at the same or different sites for different samples within this study.

It might help the reader to have the discussion of the balance of divergence and reversal (presently in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion) sooner, e.g. in the subsection \"Extensive reversion toward consensus\". The findings in this regard relate to a major ongoing debate in molecular evolution about the extent to which diverged homologs retain strong propensities for specific amino acids. Pollock et al. (PNAS, 109:E1352) and Shah et al. (PNAS, 112:E3226) have argued that pervasive epistasis means that the propensities for specific amino acids means will diverge rapidly among homologs, which will quickly come to favor different amino acids at homologous sites. On the other hand, Ashenberg et al. (PNAS, 110:21071), Risso et al. (Mol Biol Evol, 32:440), and Doud et al. (Mol Biol Evol, doi:10.1093/molbev/msv167) have argued that the propensities for specific amino acids are similar among homologs. How do your results bear on this issue?"
