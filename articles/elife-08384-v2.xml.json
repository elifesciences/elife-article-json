However, the relationship between its two paralogs, STAT5A and STAT5B, and the extent to which they are functionally distinct, remain uncertain. Using mouse models of paralog deficiency, we demonstrate that they are not equivalent for CD4<sup>+</sup> 'helper' T cells, the principal orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Instead, we find that STAT5B is dominant for both effector and regulatory (Treg) responses and, therefore, uniquely necessary for immunological tolerance. Comparative analysis of genomic distribution and transcriptomic output confirm that STAT5B has fargreater impact but, surprisingly, the data point towards asymmetric expression (i.e. paralog dose), rather than distinct functional properties, as the key distinguishing feature. Thus, we propose a quantitative model of STAT5 paralog activity whereby relative abundance imposes functional specificity (or dominance) in the face of widespread structural homology."

However, the relationship between its two paralogs, STAT5A and STAT5B, and the extent to which they are functionally distinct, remain uncertain. Using mouse models of paralog deficiency, we demonstrate that they are not equivalent for CD4<sup>+</sup> 'helper' T cells, the principal orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Instead, we find that STAT5B is dominant for both effector and regulatory (Treg) responses and, therefore, uniquely necessary for immunological tolerance. Comparative analysis of genomic distribution and transcriptomic output confirm that STAT5B has fargreater impact but, surprisingly, the data point towards asymmetric expression (i.e. paralog dose), rather than distinct functional properties, as the key distinguishing feature. Thus, we propose a quantitative model of STAT5 paralog activity whereby relative abundance imposes functional specificity (or dominance) in the face of widespread structural homology."

In mammals, STAT5 is unique because it is encoded by two genes, termed <i>Stat5a</i> and <i>Stat5b</i>, derived from a relatively recent duplication event (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang and Levy, 2012</a>). In fact, the ancestral STAT5 gene appears to have duplicated on two separate occasions during vertebrate evolution. Once in teleosts, resulting in two paralogs on different chromosomes, and again in eutherians, resulting in the two contiguous mammalian paralogs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Liongue et al., 2012</a>)."

Genetically engineered mice lacking <i>Stat5a</i> or <i>Stat5b</i> have provided compelling evidence for both arguments. On one hand, there are phenotypic differences; <i>Stat5a</i>-deficient mice exhibit poor mammary function (<a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 1997</a>), reduced hematopoietic stem cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhang et al., 2000</a>) and diminished antibody class switching (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kagami et al., 2000</a>), while <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice exhibit dwarfism (<a href=\"#bib64\">Udy et al., 1997</a>), more pronounced lymphopenia, and greater defects in cytokine-driven lymphocyte proliferation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Moriggl et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Imada et al., 1998</a>). On the other hand, deletion of <i>Stat5a</i> and <i>Stat5b</i> has comparable effects on some physiological processes, such as eosinophil recruitment (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kagami et al., 2000</a>), and the most dramatic phenotypes, such as infertility, anemia and perinatal lethality, are evident only in mice lacking both paralogs, which implies redundancy and/or cooperativity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Teglund et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Socolovsky et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cui et al., 2004</a>). Genome-wide DNA-binding profiles also support both viewpoints. The target repertoires for STAT5A and STAT5B mostly overlap, which implies redundancy, but there are also a subset of sites that may be differentially bound, which implies specificity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yamaji et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kanai et al., 2014</a>).

The \u0263c is shared by 6 different cytokines, IL-2 IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21, each of which employs a unique co-receptor subunit that determines which cell types can respond (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rochman et al., 2009</a>). \u0263c cytokines impact all lymphocytes but have been most extensively studied in CD4<sup>+</sup> 'helper' T cells, the key orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Among the many functions ascribed to the \u0263c-STAT5 axis in this lineage are the ability to promote Th1- and Th2-type effector responses, to support T cell memory, to promote activation-induced cell death, to suppress Th17-type and T follicular helper cell (Tfh) responses, and to promote T regulatory cell (Treg) responses (<a href=\"#bib48\">Moriggl, Topham, et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dooms et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zhu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kagami et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lenardo, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Laurence et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ballesteros-Tato et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Johnston et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mahmud et al., 2013</a>)."

These studies reveal STAT5B as the dominant paralog in helper T cells; exhibiting far greater impact on pathogenic effector and host-protective regulatory responses and, therefore, uniquely required for immunological tolerance. Surprisingly, genome-wide DNA binding and transcriptome surveys did not uncover widespread differences in target gene selection but, instead, point towards relative abundance as the key distinguishing factor. Thus, we propose that asymmetric expression (i.e. paralog dose), rather than differential function, determines the dominant STAT5 paralog in lymphoid cells."

We refer to each genotype according to the total number of <i>Stat5</i> alleles that are retained. For example, two-allele <i>Stat5a</i>-deficient mice lack both <i>Stat5a</i> alleles but retain two of <i>Stat5b (Stat5a<sup>-/-</sup> Stat5b<sup>+/+</sup></i>), while one-allele <i>Stat5a</i>-deficient mice lack both <i>Stat5a</i> alleles and retain just one of <i>Stat5b (Stat5a<sup>-/-</sup> Stat5b<sup>+/-</sup></i>). All 8 genotypes were born at the expected Mendelian ratios and survived beyond 6 months of age, thereby demonstrating that a single allele of either paralog is sufficient to prevent the perinatal lethality seen in STAT5-null mice (<b>Data not shown</b>)(<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoelbl et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cui et al., 2004</a>). Red blood cell counts and hematocrits were comparable across all genotypes, indicating that a single allele is also enough to support erythropoiesis, but white blood cell (WBC) counts were sharply reduced in one-allele <i>Stat5a</i>- or <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice, as well as two-allele <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice. By contrast, two-allele <i>Stat5a</i>-deficient mice had relatively normal WBC counts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Unlike STAT5-null mice, which exhibit a profound lack of Treg cells (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burchill et al., 2006</a>), frequencies of splenic FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells were relatively normal across our STAT5 mutants. However, due to differences in overall cellularity, absolute counts were significantly lower in one- and two-allele <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice, as well one-allele <i>Stat5a</i>-deficient mice. A similar trend was observed for LN resident Treg cells; frequencies were comparable to WT controls but total numbers were reduced in all genotypes bearing less than 3 total alleles (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To further characterize the Treg compartment, we measured IL-2R\u03b1, a component of the IL-2 receptor that is critical for Treg cell homeostasis and function. It is also a both upstream and downstream of STAT5 signaling and, thus, can be viewed as an indicator of STAT5 activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Malek and Castro, 2010</a>). We found that the percentage of IL-2R\u03b1<sup>+</sup> Treg cells mirrored the total number of <i>Stat5</i> alleles; it was slightly reduced in mice with three alleles, lower in those with 2, and lower still in those with 1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). We also noted that residual IL-2R\u03b1<sup>+</sup> Treg cells from one-allele mice had reduced suppressive capacity and were unable to maintain expression of IL-2R\u03b1 during in vitro culture (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>).

Next, we used statistical variance to identify differentially expressed genes. Surprisingly, we found widespread discord between <i>Stat5a</i>- and <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient cells; many transcripts appeared dysregulated in the absence of one paralog or the other (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). However, upon close inspection, we concluded that this disparity was largely due to the arbitrary\u00a0fold-change cutoff that was used. Most genes that were designated as STAT5B-specific were also affected by the loss of STAT5A (and vice versa), albeit to a lesser degree that did not reach our 2-fold threshold (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). To avoid this statistical artifact, we devised a \u2018paralog preference\u2019 scale whereby all STAT5-sensitive genes were compiled and ranked according to how much they were impacted by the loss of <i>Stat5a</i> or <i>Stat5b</i>. This analysis revealed a binomial distribution for all experimental conditions. The majority of genes were in central bins, affected by both STAT5A and STAT5B, while membership in peripheral bins decreased steadily as paralog preference increased. Importantly, all curves were shifted towards STAT5B, suggesting that STAT5-sensitive genes are generally more impacted by STAT5B than STAT5A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This latter trend was also evident at the protein level; IL-2-driven (but not IL-6-driven) induction of IL-2R\u03b1 was clearly more diminished in <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient cells than in <i>Stat5a</i>-deficient counterparts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Collectively, these data affirm that STAT5B is dominant over STAT5A while, at the same time, demonstrating pervasive redundancy at the level of gene transcription."

Using strict analysis criteria, we discovered that between 12% and 22% of all STAT5-sensitive genes can be classified as paralog-specific, meaning that they are solely dependent on either STAT5A or STAT5B. The absolute number of paralog-specific genes varied across cell states and stimuli, with the largest allotment found in IL-7-treated naive cells, and was typically skewed towards STAT5B (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> &amp; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Thus, we can create 2 general categories: \u2018pan-STAT5' genes that are regulated by both STAT5A and STAT5B (e.g. <i>Pdk1, Cish, Lta</i>) and 'paralog-specific' genes that are regulated by either STAT5A (e.g. <i>Smc6</i>) or STAT5B (e.g. <i>Cd74</i>)(<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> &amp; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Given that pan-STAT5 genes are much more numerous, we propose that phenotypic differences between <i>Stat5a</i> and <i>Stat5b</i> deficient T cells are due largely to paralog preference, owing to the fact that deletion of <i>Stat5b</i> has greater quantitative impact, with limited contribution from qualitative,\u00a0paralog-specific effects."

Previous studies have addressed this issue by comparing genomic distributions by ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing) using separate, paralog-specific antibodies in WT cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kanai et al., 2014</a>). We took an alternative approach involving a single antibody that recognizes both paralogs and T cells from <i>Stat5a</i>- or <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice, as well as \u2018double heterozygotes\u2019 (hereafter referred to as <i>Stat5a/b<sup>het</sup></i> mice). In line with previous studies, 1275 unique regions of STAT5 occupancy were called for WT cells(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). By contrast, <i>Stat5a/b<sup>het</sup></i> cells had fewer peaks (658 total; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) that tended to be less robust (i.e. lower signal intensity) than those found in WT controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), indicating that changes in STAT5 availability can impact genomic distribution even when both paralogs are present. Total peaks were also reduced in <i>Stat5a</i>-deficient cells (609 total) and almost expunged in <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient cells (97 total), again, illustrating both the relevance of the former and the dominance of the latter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). STAT5 peaks were similarly localized across all genotypes - they typically congregated near transcriptional start sites but could also be found at distal regions, sometimes &gt;100 kb from annotated genes - and were highly enriched for STAT-binding motifs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> &amp; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Assuming the latter, it is also unclear how specificity can be achieved given their extensive structural homology. Both positions are grounded in sound experimental evidence but, until the present studies, there has been no comprehensive inquiry on their relationship in immune cells. We addressed this longstanding question in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells, the principal orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Using a combination of genetic and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that STAT5B is dominant over STAT5A and, thus, plays a non-redundant role in controlling effector and regulatory T cell responses. This conclusion is based on phenotypic differences between <i>Stat5a</i>- and <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice, as well as bioinformatic analyses showing that STAT5B has greater impact on both selection and transcription of STAT5 target genes. The disparity does not appear to be due to differences in genome wide distribution or transcriptional capacity but, instead, relates to differences in relative abundance. Consistent with the latter point, our loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrate that a threshold concentration of STAT5 must be reached to execute STAT5-dependent gene expression and differentiation programs. Based on these findings, we submit that STAT5A and STAT5B are largely redundant at the molecular level, but not at the cellular or organismal levels, where STAT5B is dominant."

However, this notion has been disputed because the nature and location of the amino acid substitutions may not alter protein structure enough to impact specificity. In addition, multiple studies have shown that the consensus DNA-binding motifs for STAT5A and STAT5B are identical, although it should be noted that these measured optimal binding to synthetic oligonucleotides in cell free systems, leaving open the possibility that divergent binding properties become apparent only at lower affinity sites or in the context of native chromatin (<a href=\"#bib59\">Soldaini et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ehret et al., 2001</a>). Indeed, differential binding of STAT5A or STAT5B has been detected at several loci in primary immune cells but it remains unclear whether this reflects <i>bonafide</i> differences in specificity or other factors that may influence target gene selection (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yamaji et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kanai et al., 2014</a>). For instance, it is known that STAT5A and STAT5B can exhibit distinct phosphorylation patterns, so preferential binding may reflect cell type- or stimulus-specific differences in activation rather than distinct targeting capabilities (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caldenhoven et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hennighausen and Robinson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rosen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Meinke et al., 1996</a>).

The idea that STAT5 concentration can impact cellular function also has precedent. Of particular interest are studies reporting severe immunological phenotypes in transgenic mice which over-express STAT5A or STAT5B (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kelly et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kelly et al., 2003b</a>), and studies showing that <i>Stat5a/b</i> haplo-insufficiency ameliorates contact hypersensitivity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nivarthi et al., 2014</a>). In addition, we have previously demonstrated that ectopic STAT5A can expand the target repertoire of STAT5 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>), and have explored the concept of STAT5 gene dosage in the context of mammary development, finding that a high STAT5 threshold must be reached for mammary epithelial cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yamaji et al., 2013</a>). Given that STAT5A is the dominant paralog in mammary epithelium, we can infer that asymmetric expression of STAT5 paralogs is not just a feature of immune cells, and that it must be controlled in a tissue-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib47\">Metser et al., 2016</a>). Several mechanisms may explain this phenomenon. First, it is known that <i>Stat5a</i> and <i>Stat5b</i> are transcribed from opposite DNA strands and, thus, may be subject to strand-specific modes of regulation (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Second, differential transcription could be achieved through paralog-specific enhancer elements whose accessibility is tissue- and/or cell type-restricted. We have recently characterized an intergenic enhancer that drives expression of <i>Stat5a</i> in mammary epithelium and have identified multiple DNase hypersensitivity sites within the <i>Stat5b</i> locus that are present in T cells but not in non-lymphoid tissues, perhaps indicating an analogous mechanism for immune cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Metser et al., 2016</a>)(<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Third, paralog-specific epigenetic modifications, such as histone or DNA methylation, may impose distinct transcriptional outputs, as shown for tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>). Fourth, the 3\u2019 UTRs of <i>Stat5a</i> and <i>Stat5b</i> are highly divergent so it is possible that their mRNAs are subject to post-transcriptional regulation via distinct sets of microRNAs and/or RNA-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 1995</a>)."

Several observations support this latter point: 1) deletion of one <i>Stat5a</i> allele exaggerates the gross and cellular phenotypes of <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice, 2) transcription of STAT5 target genes is typically influenced by both STAT5A or STAT5B, and 3) ectopic STAT5A can rescue gene expression in <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient cells. Furthermore, just one-allele of either <i>Stat5a</i> or <i>Stat5b</i> is sufficient to prevent the perinatal lethality and anemia seen in STAT5-null mice, suggesting that molecular redundancy protects the most critical \u2018life-and-death\u2019 functions. We also identified a small subset of genes that appear to be regulated by either STAT5A or STAT5B, some of which have known immunological functions. Given that STAT5B is more abundant, it can be argued that all STAT5B-dependency may be due to a high paralog dose threshold, but this cannot explain the appearance of STAT5A-dependent genes. Thus, we propose that phenotypic differences between <i>Stat5a</i>- and <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient T cells result from widespread \u2018paralog preference\u2019 and circumscribed 'paralog specificity'."

Previous studies have compared genomic distribution of STAT5A and STAT5B in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and found that they mostly overlap, thereby supporting the idea of redundancy (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kanai et al., 2014</a>). However, they also identified a subset of sites that are occupied by one paralog or the other and, thus, have been taken as evidence for paralog specificity. All such comparisons (including ours) should be interpreted with care. Shared sites can be appointed with confidence but, due to technical confounders (e.g. differences in antibody affinity), incongruent sites cannot be definitively classified as STAT5A- or STAT5B-specific. The mechanisms underlying differential binding must also be considered. It is possible that <i>bona fide</i> paralog-specific binding sites do exist, but these are probably only a minor fraction. In most cases, differential binding likely reflects competition; the more abundant paralog is more likely to be detected. Given this nuance, claims that certain genes are uniquely regulated by STAT5A or STAT5B should be tempered. For instance, it has been suggested that <i>Bcl2l1</i> is regulated only by STAT5A and that <i>Bcl2, Il2ra</i> and <i>Foxp3</i> are regulated only by STAT5B (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kanai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jenks et al., 2013</a>).

This principle is well illustrated in humans with congenital <i>STAT5B</i> defects, who typically manifest a range of autoimmune symptoms (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kanai et al., 2012</a>), and is further supported by the present work, which demonstrates that <i>Stat5b</i> deficiency leads to spontaneous kidney disease in mice. The link between STAT5 and autoimmunity is often attributed to its role downstream of IL-2/IL-2R\u03b1 in Treg cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Malek and Castro, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mahmud et al., 2013</a>). Our work clearly endorses this viewpoint and brings to mind the autoimmune phenotype of Treg-deficient <i>Scurfy</i> mice which, like <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice, exhibit both autoantibodies and kidney disease {Aschermann:2013gn}. We demonstrate that, similar to <i>STAT5B</i>-deficient humans (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cohen et al., 2006</a>), Treg cells are functionally compromised in <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice, but, surprisingly, the baseline frequency of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells was not reduced, likely reflecting immunological and/or environmental differences between the two species. We also present new ideas about why STAT5-deficient Treg cells are impaired. First, they acquire the ability to produce IL-2, a cytokine that is typically restricted in Treg cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Malek and Castro, 2010</a>). This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that STAT5 can suppress IL-2 production by conventional T cells and, given that Treg cells are thought to operate, in part, by consuming IL-2, it provides one explanation for their ineffectiveness (<a href=\"#bib65\">Villarino et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pandiyan et al., 2007</a>). Second, they fail to express TBX21, a transcription factor that is required to limit Th1-type T cell responses (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koch et al., 2009</a>). Previous studies have shown that STAT1-activating cytokines (e.g. interferons, IL-27) can induce TBX21 in Treg cells but we are the first to show that IL-2, a STAT5-activating cytokine, can do it (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hall et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Koch et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "Aside from its role in Treg cells, STAT5 promotes immunological tolerance via effector cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Given the dramatic accumulation of Tfh cells in our STAT5 mutants, the capacity of Tfh cells to promote autoimmunity, and recent work showing that STAT5 can suppress Tfh differentiation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ballesteros-Tato et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Johnston et al., 2012</a>), we conclude that exaggerated Tfh responses factor heavily in the autoantibody responses and attendant kidney pathology seen in <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice. Our data also suggest an intimate relationship between STAT5 and BCL6, the \u2018master\u2019 transcription factor for Tfh cells. We report that STAT5 directly engages the <i>Bcl6</i> locus, where it likely acts as a transcriptional repressor, and that STAT5 binding sites are often enriched for BCL6 motifs, consistent with published accounts of co-localization between these two transcription factors (Y. <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liao et al., 2014</a>). These findings strongly implicate Tfh cells in the pathogenesis of <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient mice but, since these are germline \u2018knockouts\u2019, we must consider the (likely) possibility that intrinsic defects in other cell types contribute to the autoimmune phenotype. For instance, multiple dendritic cell subsets are known to be dysregulated in <i>Stat5-</i> or <i>Jak3</i>-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib13\">Esashi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yamaoka, 2005</a>), and its influence on non-immune cells, particularly downstream of hormone receptors, cannot be ignored (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kuhrt and Wojchowski, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hennighausen and Robinson, 2008</a>)."

Clinical use of STAT5-activating cytokines and growth factors (e.g. IL-2, erythropoetin) is now commonplace and the recent approval of Jak3 inhibitors for the treatment of autoimmune disease and malignancy points to sustained interest in this pathway (<a href=\"#bib66\">Villarino et al., 2015</a>). Consequently, a detailed understanding of how STAT5 signaling works is imperative not only to inform new drugs, but also to improve existing regimens. The present study yields multiple clinically relevant insights and, in particular, raises two key issues that should be considered. First, partial inhibition of STAT5 expression and or activity may be sufficient to have desired effects on immune cell function. Second, targeting of STAT5A may be safer (though perhaps less robust) than targeting of STAT5B. Therefore, taking a broad view, our findings provide a molecular rationale for exploiting STAT5 paralog redundancy in clinical settings."

When multiple fragments were detected for a single gene, only the most abundant (i.e. highest average RPKM across all 3 genotypes) was considered for downstream analyses. Transcripts with RPKM values of less than 1 for all genotypes within a given cell type or condition were excluded. Fold change and variance across genotypes and biological replicates were calculated using EdgeR (<a href=\"#bib54\">Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth, 2009</a>). Transcripts were classified as differentially expressed if they exhibited a &gt;1.5 fold change and significant pairwise variance (p&lt;0.05) relative to WT controls.

First, all transcripts that were differentially expressed in <i>Stat5a</i>- or <i>Stat5b</i>- deficient cells (relative to WT controls) were pooled to generate a single list of STAT5-regulated genes for each cell type or condition. Next, the absolute fold change was calculated and multiplied by the higher of the two RPKMs (WT or KO), thereby generating a 'paralog score'. Note that the use of absolute fold change negates the distinction between up- and down-regulated genes, while the multiplication step improves the score for high-abundance transcripts. The paralog score for STAT5B was then divided by the paralog score for STAT5A and the resulting 'preference score' was log 2 transformed so that transcripts which are more impacted by the loss of STAT5B are assigned positive values while those which are more impacted by the loss of STAT5A are assigned negative values. All transcripts were then segregated into 12 bins according to preference scores (Bin 1 includes values of less than -5, Bin 2 ranges from -5 to -4, and so on).

This conclusion is supported in the original manuscript by gain-of-function studies showing that ectopic STAT5A can rescue gene expression in <i>Stat5b-</i>deficient T cells but, as noted by the reviewers, these did not address whether it can also rescue cellular differentiation. To explore the latter possibility, we transduced <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient T cells under Treg or Th17 polarizing conditions, then measured FoxP3 and IL-17 to gauge lineage commitment. As expected, ectopic STAT5A restored their capacity to become FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells while, at the same time, limiting their capacity to become IL-17-producing effectors. Ectopic STAT5A even drove FoxP3 expression in WT and heterozygous cells (i.e. <i>Stat5a</i><sup>+/-</sup><i>Stat5b</i><sup>+/-</sup>), suggesting that availability of STAT5 is actually rate limiting for Treg differentiation. Furthermore, there was a clear, linear correlation between STAT5 protein levels, whether endogenous or ectopic, and FoxP3 induction in all genotypes, suggesting that high concentrations predispose towards the Treg lineage. Collectively, these data support our hypothesis that STAT5 paralog dose bears major influence on T cell differentiation and imply that a certain STAT5 threshold must be achieved to execute the Treg program."

To better support this point, we employed two independent strategies. First, we mined published transcriptome datasets to confirm that STAT5B is more abundant at the mRNA level (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, we refined our pan-STAT5 flow cytometry assay to better illustrate the disparity at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>)."

Therefore, we have chosen to calculate relative abundance based on the performance of a single pan-STAT5 antibody, which presumably recognizes a single homologous epitope, across a range of STAT5 allele combinations. Using this methodology, which has been refined such that we can resolve individual subsets (i.e. naive, Treg, Tfh) across 6 genotypes (or more), we confirmed that STAT5B makes the greater contribution to the total STAT5 pool. The asymmetry was most obvious in cells lacking one allele \u2013 deleting a single copy of <i>Stat5b</i> was enough to yield a phenotype while deleting a single copy <i>Stat5a</i> was not \u2013 but was also evident in those lacking two; <i>Stat5b</i>-deficient cells had far less STAT5 protein than <i>Stat5a</i>-deficient cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). We also found that STAT5 levels were consistently lower in cells from 'one allele' Stat5a-deficient mice (<i>Stat5a</i><sup>-/-</sup><i>Stat5b</i><sup>+/-</sup>) than in those from double heterozygotes (<i>Stat5a</i><sup>+/-</sup><i>Stat5b</i><sup>+/-</sup>), suggesting that, while <i>Stat5b</i> may be the dominant input, the <i>Stat5a</i> locus does make an appreciable, albeit more limited, contribution (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>)."

These ratios are in line with our original flow cytometry studies (Original <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) but less dramatic than what we had observed by western blotting (Original <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>), likely due to differences in sensitivity between the two assays. Given this inconsistency, and the fact that our original flow cytometry studies did not distinguish individual T cell subsets, we have chosen to include only our latest flow cytometry data in the revised manuscript."

Upon inspection, we found that this was evident only when cells were cultured for 72 hours, not when they were cultured for 96 hours (Data not shown) or under iTreg polarizing conditions (data from <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We also found no evidence for such an effect in published datasets (Data not shown), nor could we detect it at the protein level (Data not shown). Thus, while it remains possible that acute stimuli (i.e. TCR engagement, co-stimulation) temporarily alter the balance between STAT5 paralogs, we are unsure about the kinetics and/or robustness of this phenomenon and, thus, have decided to omit all mention of it from the revised manuscript."
