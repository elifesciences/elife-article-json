The key challenge is to understand how to categorize events in ways that are useful to the animal, and also practical to implement. Typically, this involves separating information about an event (for example, what kind of object has just appeared in the animal's environment?) from information about where the event happened (<a href=\"#bib3\">DiCarlo et al., 2012</a>)."

In particular it is thought that the initial signal detected by sensory neurons in the peripheral regions of the brain undergoes a series of transformations as it is passed from one set of neurons to another. The end result is to produce an representation of the event (for example, the presence of another animal of a particular species) that does not depend on where the event happened. However, much remains to be understood about the transformations that would make this possible."

Now, in eLife, Michael Metzen, Volker Hofmann and Maurice Chacron from McGill University report the results of experiments on fish called brown ghost knifefish (<a href=\"#bib6\">Metzen et al., 2016</a>). These fish live in murky water and produce electric signals in order to \u201csee\u201d their environment. Such fish are known as weakly electric fish because the electrical discharges they produce, while strong enough to \"see\" objects, are not strong enough to be used as weapons."

It also uses an array of electroreceptors on its surface to detect changes in this electric field: these changes could be caused by other fish, both electric and non-electric, predator or prey, as well as other objects. Metzen et al. focused on what happens when a knifefish communicates with another knifefish. Each knifefish emits at a slightly different frequency, so when two knifefish come into close proximity of each other, these frequencies interfere to generate a beat pattern. The frequency of this beat pattern is equal to the difference between the two original frequencies."

This leads to\u00a0a change in\u00a0both the frequency and phase of the beat pattern (with the change in the phase having any value between zero and 360 degrees). The phase can change again (by between zero and 360 degrees) depending upon the timing of the response from the second fish. Given this ambiguity, how can the fish recognize each other when each fish can produce a wide range of different phase changes in the beat pattern?"

Metzen et al. report that neural responses at each successive stage of processing depend less and less on the phase.

This shows that one way to generate a phase-invariant response is to\u00a0correlate and combine a number of neural responses."

Relevant questions include: why are the electro-receptors on the surface of the fish distributed the way they are,\u00a0and why do the communication calls used by knifefish have the structure they do? And given that fish continue to grow throughout their lives, how does the electrosensory system continue to operate when the anatomy of the fish is changing constantly? An answer to this last question could help to improve our understanding of how mammalian systems cope with aging and adaptation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Webster et al., 2006</a>)."

The diversity of these solutions can be mapped onto biological diversity. For example, why do some fish probe their environment with electric fields, whereas bats use echolocation? From a computational perspective, there are also parallels between electrosensation in weakly electric fish and song communication in birds, auditory vocalizations in dolphins and non-human primates, and human speech (<a href=\"#bib4\">Kanwal and Rauschecker, 2007</a>). Comparative analysis of these systems in terms of information and energy efficiency will help to elucidate the general principles of how neural circuits work."
