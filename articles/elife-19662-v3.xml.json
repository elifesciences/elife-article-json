                    "text": "Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released by dead cells that trigger sterile inflammation and, in vertebrates, adaptive immunity. Actin is a DAMP detected in mammals by the receptor, DNGR-1, expressed by dendritic cells (DCs). DNGR-1 is phosphorylated by Src-family kinases and recruits the tyrosine kinase Syk to promote DC cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens. Here we report that actin is also a DAMP in invertebrates that lack DCs and adaptive immunity. Administration of actin to <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> triggers a response characterised by selective induction of STAT target genes in the fat body through the cytokine Upd3 and its JAK/STAT-coupled receptor, Domeless. Notably, this response requires signalling via Shark, the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of Syk, and Src42A, a <i>Drosophila</i> Src-family kinase, and is dependent on Nox activity. Thus, extracellular actin detection via a Src-family kinase-dependent cascade is an ancient means of detecting cell injury that precedes the evolution of adaptive immunity."

Actin is a DAMP detected in mammals by the receptor, DNGR-1, expressed by dendritic cells (DCs). DNGR-1 is phosphorylated by Src-family kinases and recruits the tyrosine kinase Syk to promote DC cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens. Here we report that actin is also a DAMP in invertebrates that lack DCs and adaptive immunity. Administration of actin to <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> triggers a response characterised by selective induction of STAT target genes in the fat body through the cytokine Upd3 and its JAK/STAT-coupled receptor, Domeless. Notably, this response requires signalling via Shark, the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of Syk, and Src42A, a <i>Drosophila</i> Src-family kinase, and is dependent on Nox activity. Thus, extracellular actin detection via a Src-family kinase-dependent cascade is an ancient means of detecting cell injury that precedes the evolution of adaptive immunity."

It is likely that this response evolved to clear cell debris, promote tissue repair and maintain tissue sterility (<a href=\"#bib89\">Zelenay and Reis e Sousa, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Eming et al., 2014</a>) but, if uncontrolled, it can lead to (aseptic) shock and, in some cases, death (<a href=\"#bib72\">Rock et al., 2010</a>). The prevailing notion is that sterile inflammation is initiated by pro-inflammatory signals that are released by damaged cells. These include intracellular components that are exposed when cells lose their membrane integrity, such as ATP, uric acid, RNA and DNA, collectively known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Rock et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Zelenay and Reis e Sousa, 2013</a>). The universe of DAMPs and their receptors, as well as the mechanisms regulating DAMP responses, remains underexplored. This is partly because early research in this area was tainted by issues of microbial contamination (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beg, 2002</a>) and because immunologists have often focussed on sterile inflammation from the narrow perspective of adaptive immunity (<a href=\"#bib54\">Matzinger, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Land et al., 1994</a>). However, it is probable that responses to DAMPs, like responses to microbes, pre-date the vertebrate evolution of T and B cells and have an early metazoan origin, much like the\u00a0clearance of dead cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Krysko et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hochreiter-Hufford and Ravichandran, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Eming et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, the study of invertebrate responses to DAMPs could offer a different perspective into the induction of sterile inflammation, akin to how research into insect immunity to infection led to the identification of Toll signalling and paved the way to the discovery of an analogous pathway in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lemaitre et al., 1996</a>)."

                        "text": "The immune system of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> has been widely studied in the context of infection. It consists of a cellular and a humoural arm, in addition to cell-intrinsic antiviral RNAi responses (<a href=\"#bib13\">Buchon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>). The cellular arm is made up of three macrophage-like types of cells, collectively termed haemocytes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Buchon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>). The humoural immune response relies on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are synthesised in the fat body (the fly equivalent of the liver) and then secreted into the haemolymph to provide systemic protection from bacteria and fungi (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Buchon et al., 2014</a>). The production of AMPs is regulated by two different pathways. The Toll pathway is activated by peptidoglycan fragments of Gram-positive bacteria, fungal \u03b2-glucans, and pathogen-derived protease activity in the haemolymph (<a href=\"#bib13\">Buchon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>). The Imd pathway is activated by peptidoglycan fragments from Gram-negative bacteria (<a href=\"#bib13\">Buchon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007</a>). Activation of either pathway results in the translocation of distinct NF-\u03baB family transcription factors into the nucleus and the subsequent synthesis of AMPs best suited to neutralise the type of microorganism detected (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Buchon et al., 2014</a>). A third pathway contributing to <i>Drosophila</i> humoural immunity involves Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling. In contrast to the Toll and Imd pathway, the JAK/STAT pathway has not yet been shown to be directly induced by sensors of invading microorganisms (<a href=\"#bib59\">Myllym\u00e4ki and R\u00e4met, 2014</a>). However, it has been implicated in resistance to as well as tolerance to viral infections (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dostert et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lamiable et al., 2016</a>). Notably, the JAK/STAT pathway is activated by different types of stresses (e.g. heat, mechanical pressure, oxidative stress or UV irradiation) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lemaitre et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ekengren et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ekengren and Hultmark, 2001</a>). All of these insults likely result in cell death suggesting the possibility that JAK/STAT pathway activation might be triggered by DAMPs rather than microbes."

The binding of Upds induces Domeless dimerization and activation of a single JAK (termed Hopscotch). Activated Hopscotch proteins phosphorylate one another allowing for recruitment of the single <i>Drosophila</i> STAT family transcription factor, STAT92E. The latter is then phosphorylated by Hopscotch, resulting in dimerisation and translocation into the nucleus. STAT92E dimers bind to the promoters of their target genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kiu and Nicholson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bina et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">M\u00fcller et al., 2005</a>) including, amongst others, ones encoding proteins involved in viral resistance (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lamiable et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dostert et al., 2005</a>), as well as proteins of the Turandot family such as Turandot M (TotM). The exact function of Turandot family proteins is not known but they have been controversially argued to be linked to stress resistance (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ekengren and Hultmark, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ekengren et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mahapatra and Rand, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Zhong et al., 2013</a>). Besides a role in host defence, the JAK/STAT pathway has also been linked to energy metabolism (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</a>) and regenerative processes, for example in the gut (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jiang et al., 2009</a>). The involvement of JAK/STAT signalling in regeneration is particularly interesting given the role of DAMPs in contributing to tissue repair (<a href=\"#bib81\">V\u00e9n\u00e9reau et al., 2015</a>)."

DNGR-1 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases and then signals via Syk although it does not induce inflammation. Rather, DNGR-1 is expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) and signals to favour cross-presentation of antigens from dead cells, contributing to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to cytopathic infections and, possibly, tumours (<a href=\"#bib31\">Iborra et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zelenay et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sancho et al., 2009</a>). We and others subsequently found that the DAMP recognised by DNGR-1 is F-actin, the polymer of G-actin that provides higher eukaryotic cells with structural integrity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Actin is an ideal DAMP given that it is extremely conserved (90% identity between yeast and humans) and highly abundant and ubiquitous within all eukaryotic cells but absent from extracellular fluids. We therefore hypothesised that released actin constitutes an evolutionarily-conserved DAMP whose detection might involve a signalling pathway conserved from flies to mammals. This would be analogous to the conservation of the Toll signalling pathway (albeit not the upstream receptors) in the <i>Drosophila</i> and vertebrate response to fungi and bacteria. Here, we show systemic administration of actin to <i>Drosophila</i> selectively triggers a JAK/STAT response and that this requires the fly homologues of Src and Syk. Our data therefore reveal an evolutionarily-conserved tryosine kinase-based pathway for recognising damage through sensing of released or exposed actin."

The finding that <i>TotM</i> is not induced by any of the above stimuli other than actin needs to be tempered by the fact that they were all tested at a single, somewhat arbitrary, dose but it also acts as a control for the effects of injection-mediated injury. Importantly, the globular tertiary structure of actin was required for the response as injection of denatured protein failed to elicit <i>TotM</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2e</a>). Finally, actin injection induced equivalent <i>TotM</i> levels in germ-free and SPF (specific pathogen free) flies, showing that microbiota or their products do not contribute to the response, despite the fact that they are inevitably introduced into the thorax of SPF flies upon piercing of the cuticle during injection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2i</a>).

However, <i>TotM</i> induction could be observed upon injection of as little as 0.1 ng actin, which corresponds to the contents of 8\u201310 cells, thereby underscoring\u00a0physiological relevance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2j</a>). Actin from all tested species (human, rabbit and <i>Drosophila</i>) induced <i>TotM</i> (see Materials and Methods), consistent with the extreme evolutionary conservation of the protein. Importantly, <i>TotM</i> induction was not due to the\u00a0cytopathic effects of actin filaments <i>in vivo</i> as the response was triggered equally by phalloidin-stabilised filamentous (F)- or latrunculin-stabilised globular (G)-actin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2k</a>). The ability of G-actin to stimulate the response <i>in vivo</i> in the absence of polymerisation could be formally demonstrated by injecting a <i>Drosophila</i> non-polymerisable G-actin mutant. The monomeric nature of the G-actin mutant used was first verified by probing with mDNGR-1 extracellular domain, which specifically binds F- but not G-actin (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Han\u010d et al., 2015</a>).

Analysis of physically-dissected body parts of <i>w</i><sup>1118</sup> flies injected with actin revealed that STAT target gene expression was enriched in regions containing the fat body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). We confirmed that STAT activation takes place in the fat body by using reporter flies in which GFP is expressed under the control of a STAT response element and in which, additionally, fat body cells are labelled with Tomato fluorescent protein for ease of organ identification (<i>Stat92</i>-dGFP<i>+LPP</i>-Gal4&gt;UAS-Myr-td-Tom). Injection of actin, but not mock injection (0 hr) or injection of buffer alone, resulted in a time-dependent increase in GFP fluorescence exclusively in Tomato<sup>+</sup> fat body cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b, c</a>). We next used a genetic approach to understand how extracellular actin leads to STAT activity in the fat body and to assess the contribution of that organ to the global response measured in total fly extracts. First, we validated the requirement for the JAK/STAT pathway by expressing a dominant negative Domeless receptor (<i>dome \u0394Cyt2.3</i>). Overexpression of <i>dome \u0394Cyt2.3</i> in the whole fly using a ubiquitous Actin-Gal4 driver resulted in significant attenuation of <i>TotM</i> expression in response to actin injection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). The same result was obtained when overexpressing <i>dome \u0394Cyt2.3</i> specifically in the fat body using a fat body-restricted, temperature-sensitive c564-Gal80<sup>ts</sup> driver (c564-Gal4; <i>Tub</i>-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Concordant with those results, the response was also attenuated in extracts of flies in which STAT signalling was reduced by overexpressing the STAT inhibitor, dPIAS, in the fat body using two different fat body-specific drivers under the control or not of a Gal80<sup>ts</sup> temperature-sensitive repressor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b, c</a>). Finally, RNAi-mediated knockdown of STAT92E specifically in fat body cells was sufficient to suppress <i>TotM</i> induction by injected actin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). These results suggest that canonical STAT-dependent <i>TotM</i> induction in the fat body accounts for the global response seen in total fly extracts."

To determine if haemocytes were similarly required for the fat body STAT response to actin, we genetically ablated them in adult flies using two haemocyte-specific (<i>croquemort</i> or <i>Hemolectin</i>) temperature-sensitive Gal80<sup>ts</sup>-Gal4 drivers crossed to a UAS-<i>rpr</i> strain encoding Reaper, a protein that induces apoptosis. Ablation of haemocytes in flies containing UAS-<i>rpr</i>, but not in control flies, was confirmed by confocal microscopy taking advantage of a fluorescent reporter protein to mark the cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a, b</a>). Despite the near-complete elimination of haemocytes, <i>TotM</i> induction in response to actin in UAS-<i>rpr</i> flies was indistinguishable from that in controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), indicating that haemocytes are redundant. We further established that haemocyte-derived Upd3 is dispensable by using a <i>upd3</i> RNAi line crossed to another line carrying a <i>Hemolectin</i>-Gal4 driver (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). We therefore tested the possibility that Upd3 might be essential but made by fat body cells themselves rather than haemocytes. Consistent with that notion, loss of the <i>TotM</i> response to actin injection was seen when the <i>upd3</i> RNAi line was crossed to a line bearing a r4-Gal4 fat body driver (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Similar results were obtained using a different fat body driver (c564-Gal4), this time under the control of Gal80<sup>ts</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>). In contrast to Upd3, knockdown of Upd1 and Upd2 in fat body cells had no effect on the response to actin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>), confirming Upd3 as the key cytokine. We conclude that extracellular actin leads to Upd3 production by fat body cells, which acts in an autocrine or paracrine fashion via Domeless to induce STAT activation and induction of STAT response genes."

                                "text": "There is no DNGR-1 orthologue in <i>Drosophila</i>. Furthermore, the ability of G-actin to trigger <i>TotM</i> suggested that a functionally-equivalent receptor is not involved. However, it was conceivable that signalling pathways downstream of DNGR-1 activation by F-actin might also be employed in the fruit fly response to extracellular G-actin. We therefore tested the requirement for Shark, a non-receptor tandem SH<sub>2</sub> kinase and <i>Drosophila</i> Syk orthologue (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fernandez et al., 2000</a>). Indeed, conditional silencing of <i>Shark</i> in adult flies using a ubiquitous driver led to a significant reduction in <i>TotM</i> expression upon actin injection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). Next, we asked whether the fat body itself might be the primary site of Shark signalling. Consistent with that notion, knockdown of <i>Shark</i> within the fat body using a c564<i>-</i>Gal80<sup>ts</sup> driver led to a large reduction in the levels of actin-induced <i>TotM</i> in total flies that had been shifted to the restrictive temperature (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). This result was confirmed using a different driver (r4-Gal4) that led to constitutively reduced Shark levels in the fat body (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). Shark activation occurs downstream of Src family kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib94\">Ziegenfuss et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Evans et al., 2015</a>). Silencing of the Src family kinase <i>Src42A</i> using a ubiquitous temperature-sensitive driver also led to a striking reduction in actin-induced <i>TotM</i> levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). As for Shark, Src42A was specifically required in the fat body because silencing with fat body-specific drivers also led to complete loss of actin-induced <i>TotM</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). In keeping with the knockdown data, overexpression of a dominant negative allele of <i>Src42A</i> (<i>Src42A<sup>DN</sup></i>) using an ubiquitous or fat body-specific driver similarly led to a marked reduction in actin-driven <i>TotM</i> levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>). Finally, the overexpression of a constitutively active form of Src42A within the fat body was sufficient to induce a <i>TotM</i> response that was comparable in magnitude to that induced by actin injection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6f</a>)."

Upd three is depicted as acting in a paracrine manner for ease of visualisation but is expected to also act in an\u00a0autocrine fashion.

While we have learned much about the pathways that trigger inflammation in response to pathogen invasion (<a href=\"#bib55\">Medzhitov, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Takeuchi and Akira, 2010</a>), we still understand relatively little about induction of sterile inflammation following tissue injury (<a href=\"#bib72\">Rock et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, dysregulated and/or chronic inflammation, often of sterile origin, is increasingly recognised as a contributing factor to a vast range of human diseases, from cancer to neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib64\">Okin and Medzhitov, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rock and Kono, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Heneka et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Zelenay and Reis e Sousa, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>). Furthermore, because injury and infection often overlap, our understanding of immunity necessitates a consideration of the interplay between the processes that detect pathogen invasion and those that sense tissue damage. The study of invertebrate responses to DAMPs might therefore lead to a new understanding of sterile inflammation and the identification of conserved elicitors, detectors and signaling pathways that are utilised across evolution to detect loss of cell integrity."

Here, we provide evidence that actin is also a DAMP in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, triggering a response that, like in vertebrates, requires Syk and Src family kinases. We show that the presence of extracellular actin in the haemolymph of <i>Drosophila</i> elicits a reaction in the fat body via Shark and Src42A, whose activation depends on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the NADPH oxidase Nox. Consistent with our data, ROS generation by NADPH oxidases is a\u00a0highly conserved response to wounding (<a href=\"#bib61\">Nam et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Takeishi et al., 2013</a>) and has been shown to directly activate Lyn/Src42A in zebrafish and <i>Drosophila</i> through oxidation of a single redox-sensitive cysteine residue (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yoo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Niethammer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Evans et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Razzell et al., 2013</a>)."

Rather, it is coupled to production of Upd3 cytokine, which acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce Domeless signalling via STAT and to cause the\u00a0induction of STAT-responsive genes, the products of which are released into the haemolymph. This systemic inflammatory-like response involving cytokine amplification and the fat body is reminiscent of the acute phase response in mammals, which can be triggered by infection or trauma and leads to the production of cytokines such as IL-6 that act on the liver (mammalian equivalent of the fat body) to cause production of acute phase proteins (<a href=\"#bib55\">Medzhitov, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kopf et al., 1994</a>). These are secreted into the plasma to regulate multiple processes such as host defence, coagulation, vascular permeability and metabolism (<a href=\"#bib55\">Medzhitov, 2010</a>). Similarly, the <i>Drosophila</i> fat body response to actin results in secretion into the haemolymph of proteins that may regulate multiple aspects of fly physiology that coordinately impact resistance or tolerance to insult. However, it is important to note that while some components of the extracellular actin-sensing circuitry are conserved between flies and mammals (Shark, Src42A and ROS), others are not (DNGR1, cross-presentation, dendritic cells). These differences suggest that DAMPs can be more conserved than their receptors or the responses they evoke. This is akin to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as, for example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a hallmark of Gram-negative bacteria. The sensing of LPS is conserved in plants, protists and animals, but the relevant receptors and subsequent responses diverge depending on the host (<a href=\"#bib62\">Neyen et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, peptidoglycans and \u03b2-glucans are used in both flies and mammals to signify bacterial or fungal presence, yet are detected by different receptors that, nevertheless, can couple to conserved signalling pathways."

How such seemingly disparate stimuli trigger a single pathway is puzzling. However, a common denominator in all these settings is cell death and it has been speculated that STAT activation might therefore occur in response to DAMP release (<a href=\"#bib75\">Shaukat et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Buchon et al., 2014</a>). Our data support that notion and suggest that actin is a potent DAMP for triggering the JAK/STAT pathway. Notably, pathogen infection in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> has been shown to lead to the release of actin into the haemolymph, where it can act as an antibacterial or antiparasitic agent (<a href=\"#bib80\">Vierstraete et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Sandiford et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, actin release may serve as a two-pronged defense mechanism, both directly as an antimicrobial and indirectly by activating a systemic JAK/STAT response."

Despite being commonly used as a marker of STAT activation, the function of <i>Tot</i> and <i>Tep</i> proteins in <i>Drosophila</i> is unknown. Nevertheless, genetic loss-of-function studies have implicated JAK/STAT signaling in resistance and/or tolerance to viral, bacterial and parasitoid infections (<a href=\"#bib84\">Yang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agaisse et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agaisse and Perrimon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brun et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dostert et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lamiable et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chakrabarti et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kemp et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Merkling et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the JAK/STAT pathway has a well-established role in maintenance of fly intestinal homeostasis, both at steady state and following infection or injury (<a href=\"#bib8\">Biteau et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kohlmaier et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jiang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Osman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Beebe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Zhai et al., 2015</a>). Given these precedents, we attempted to investigate the role of the inducible actin-triggered JAK/STAT circuit by injecting actin into flies prior to challenge with viruses (Flock house virus, Drosophila C virus, Sindbis virus and Cricket paralysis virus) or bacteria (<i>Erwinia carotovora, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus</i> and <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>) but failed to find an effect on either resistance or tolerance to infection (data not shown). Similarly, in models of stress or injury (starvation, heat shock, irradiation, paraquat feeding and a recently-described model of concussion (<a href=\"#bib35\">Katzenberger et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2015</a>)), we found no evidence of protection or susceptibility afforded by actin pre-injection (data not shown). Finally, we have also not found an effect of actin injection on fat body metabolism (data not shown). The failure to find a system in which prior upregulation of STAT target genes by exogenous actin leads to a difference in outcome is a current experimental limitation. However, it might reflect the fact that STAT activation is already induced to sufficient levels in those models in response to actin released from dying cells. Consistent with this notion, we observed that septic injury led to a rapid increase in actin levels within the haemolymph. In such a situation, additional induction of the STAT pathway by actin pre-injection may not confer additional protection or tolerance. Reinforcing this notion is a recent study showing that loss of basal Diedel levels leads to reduced tolerance to Sindbis virus, yet the upregulation of Diedel levels that takes place during infection is itself dispensable (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lamiable et al., 2016</a>). Unfortunately, loss-of-function experiments to assess the effect of released actin on different challenges are not feasible because actin is essential for viability. Surrogate loss-of-function experiments, such as examining the role of <i>Nox</i> and <i>Src42A</i> or <i>Shark</i> in the fat body in the context of infection or injury, have not been reported and their interpretation is complicated by the pleiotropic effects of those proteins. Nevertheless, our finding that actin is released into the haemolymph upon septic injury and that this induces JAK/STAT activation dependent on fat body expression of <i>Src42A</i> and <i>Nox</i> may suggest that previous reports of septic injury-induced STAT activation can be partially ascribed to extracellular actin."

The requirement for Upd3 rules out the possibility that actin serves as a direct ligand for <i>Domeless</i>, a conclusion further supported by the fact that actin does not induce <i>TotM</i> upregulation in various <i>Drosophila</i> cell lines that respond to Upd cytokines in vitro (data not shown). Therefore, the simplest interpretation of our data is that Upd3 is synthesised by fat body cells that detect extracellular actin via a sensor(s) that couple(s) to a Nox-Src42A-Shark cascade (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By analogy with other receptors that engage a Syk-dependent pathway, that sensor might be an ITAM- or hemITAM-bearing receptor or one that associates in trans with an ITAM-containing signalling chain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brubaker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Robinson et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, in <i>Drosophila</i> responses to wounding and in the\u00a0clearance of axonal debris and neuronal cell corpses, one such receptor is Draper, a member of the Nimrod family and orthologue of <i>C. elegans</i> Ced1. Draper contains an ITAM that is phosphorylated by Src42A (<a href=\"#bib49\">MacDonald et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Ziegenfuss et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Razzell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Evans et al., 2015</a>). However, we have found Draper to be dispensable for <i>TotM</i> induction in response to actin injection. Similarly, we have not found a role for Nimrod C1, C4 and the scavenger receptor CD36 (data not shown). Whether these data indicate the activity of an unknown receptor, multiple redundant receptors or an indirect sensing mechanism, akin to the activation of the vertebrate NLRP3 receptor (<a href=\"#bib51\">Martinon et al., 2009</a>), will need to be investigated."

Thus, the presence of actin in the extracellular space triggers a response previously associated with wounding and dead cell clearance, indicating that actin exposure acts as an ancient sign of tissue damage and that actin constitutes an evolutionarily-conserved DAMP. The notion that actin exposure can act as a universal sign of cell damage might apply more generally to other cytoskeletal proteins."

                                "text": "Haemolymph was isolated by gently pricking flies in the thorax area using a 27G needle. 10 flies per group were then rapidly transferred into a pre-chilled 0.5 ml microfuge tube (modified with a small hole at the nib created using a 25G needle). This was then placed into a 1.5 ml microfuge collection tube and spun for 5 min at 5000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. The resulting small drop of haemolymph was diluted in 10 \u03bcl RIPA buffer (supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche,\u00a0Switzerland)). For Western blot, haemolymph samples were diluted into Laemmli buffer, resolved using reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Merck-Millipore). Equivalent protein levels across samples were confirmed by membrane staining with Ponceau Red dye. Actin levels were assessed by probing membranes with HRP-linked monoclonal rabbit anti \u03b2-actin (clone 13E5, Cell Signaling Technology,\u00a0CA,\u00a0USA). The\u00a0signal was revealed with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Fisher\u00a0Scientific). Detection of F- and total actin by dot blot was carried out as described (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Han\u010d et al., 2015</a>)."

Expanding on these studies, Srinivasan et al. tested the hypothesis that actin is an evolutionarily conserved damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule using <i>Drosophila</i> as a model system. Indeed, they found that injection of actin into <i>Drosophila</i> triggered induction of STAT-dependent genes. They further showed that actin activates the canonical JAK-STAT pathway in the fat body of <i>Drosophila</i> through the cytokine Upd3 and the cytokine receptor Doomless. Analogous to the actin-DNGR1 pathway in mammals, the actin signaling pathway in <i>Drosophila</i> requires non-receptor tyrosine kinases Shark and Src42A, which are <i>Drosophila</i> orthologues of the mammalian kinases Syk and Src, respectively. The <i>Drosophila</i> NADPH oxidase, NOX, which generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> known to activate the Src family kinases during wound healing process, is also required for actin to induce STAT-dependent genes. The actin sensing and signaling pathway appears to operate also in fat body cells, which are proposed to produce Upd3 that then functions in an autocrine or paracrine manner to activate the Domeless-JAK-STAT pathway in the fat body. However, <i>Drosophila</i> lack an apparent DNGR1 homologue, and the sensor/receptor for actin in <i>Drosophila</i> remains unknown. The role of the actin-sensing pathway in infection or sterile inflammation also remains to be determined in part because it is not practical to perform loss of function studies of actin, which is an essential gene; identification of the actin receptor in <i>Drosophila</i> may enable such genetic studies. Nevertheless, this is an important study because it provides convincing evidence for the existence of an innate immune system that detects actin as a DAMP in <i>Drosophila</i>. This work establishes <i>Drosophila</i> as a model system to study sterile inflammation and suggests that actin is an evolutionarily conserved danger molecule from dead or damaged cells."

This led us to carry out an additional experiment that was perhaps implicit in the reviewers\u2019 suggestion, namely whether the (likely) contribution of additional transcription factors reflects a compound response to actin and something else. The obvious possibility is that commensal organisms or their products might be required, together with actin, to induce <i>TotM</i>. We therefore include new data in the revised paper showing that this is not the case. Indeed, the levels of TotM induced by actin are equivalent between germ-free and commensal-bearing flies. The same is true when we compared the <i>TotM</i> response between flies lacking or containing <i>Wolbachia</i>, a vertically-transmitted intracellular bacterium. These new data (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>) bolster our conclusion that we are studying a truly sterile response and that STAT activation and that of any other transcription factors contributing to the actin response are being elicited by the stimulus being tested."

Unfortunately, we know of no available fat body cell line and we have failed to succeed in culturing fat body cells ex vivo (not shown). We attempted to stimulate multiple cell lines (e.g. S2, S1, S2R<sup>+</sup>, Mbn2, Kc<sub>167</sub>, GM2, and Cl.8) but have seen no <i>TotM</i> induction in response to actin despite validating that such lines have a competent JAK/STAT pathway as they can respond to Upd1. This suggests that these cell lines lack the response to extracellular actin, perhaps because many are haemocyte-derived and, as we show, haemocytes are dispensable for actin-induced STAT activation in vivo. The current lack of an experimental system therefore prevents us from dissecting the actin-sensing pathway in vitro. The possibility that actin is not a ligand but causes a perturbation in vivo that couples to JAK/STAT activation indirectly is one that we had already contemplated in the previous version of our manuscript and have re-iterated in the revised Discussion."

We now show that, when flies are subjected to septic injury, actin is released into the haemolymph (New <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We further show that this induces <i>TotM</i> expression that is reduced or blocked by fat body-specific Nox or Src42A knockdown. Therefore, septic injury triggers actin release and a <i>TotM</i> response that depends on the same organ and the same molecular players that we implicated in the response to actin injection. While this is by necessity correlative (we cannot knockdown actin in vivo), it indicates that actin release does occur in vivo upon injury and that injury naturally triggers the pathway that we have uncovered using actin injection."

We have used multiple approaches to try to measure Upd3 including qPCR using two pairs of primers (Agaisse et al., 2003; Woodcock et al., 2015) and digital droplet PCR, which is superior to conventional qPCR regarding detection and quantification of rare transcripts (Hindson et al., 2011). Neither of these approaches has yielded reproducible data. After consulting with other groups in the field, we have learned that measurement of Upd3 by qPCR is not wholly reliable. Therefore, we also attempted microscopy using a Upd3-GFP line but did not get a signal in response to actin injection. Finally, we tried Western blot using two published anti-Upd3 antibodies(Chakrabarti, Poidevin and Lemaitre, 2014; Oldefest et al., 2013). These detected a protein whose size does not match that predicted for Upd3. As none of these approaches gave conclusive results in our hands, we opted to only include the genetic evidence for a role of Upd3 in actin-induced JAK/STAT activation."
