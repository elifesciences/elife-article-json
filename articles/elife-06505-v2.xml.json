                    "text": "Perforin-2 (MPEG1) is an effector of the innate immune system that limits the proliferation and spread of medically relevant Gram-negative, -positive, and acid fast bacteria. We show here that a cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex containing cullin-1 and \u03b2TrCP monoubiquitylates Perforin-2 in response to pathogen associated molecular patterns such as LPS. Ubiquitylation triggers a rapid redistribution of Perforin-2 and is essential for its bactericidal activity. Enteric pathogens such as <i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</i> and enteropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> disarm host cells by injecting cell cycle inhibiting factors (Cifs) into mammalian cells to deamidate the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. Because CRL activity is dependent upon NEDD8, Cif blocks ubiquitin dependent trafficking of Perforin-2 and thus, its bactericidal activity. Collectively, these studies further underscore the biological significance of Perforin-2 and elucidate critical molecular events that culminate in Perforin-2-dependent killing of both intracellular and extracellular, cell-adherent bacteria."

We show here that a cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex containing cullin-1 and \u03b2TrCP monoubiquitylates Perforin-2 in response to pathogen associated molecular patterns such as LPS. Ubiquitylation triggers a rapid redistribution of Perforin-2 and is essential for its bactericidal activity. Enteric pathogens such as <i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</i> and enteropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> disarm host cells by injecting cell cycle inhibiting factors (Cifs) into mammalian cells to deamidate the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. Because CRL activity is dependent upon NEDD8, Cif blocks ubiquitin dependent trafficking of Perforin-2 and thus, its bactericidal activity. Collectively, these studies further underscore the biological significance of Perforin-2 and elucidate critical molecular events that culminate in Perforin-2-dependent killing of both intracellular and extracellular, cell-adherent bacteria."

Ubiquitin works much like the shipping label of a package, enabling the efficient targeting of Perforin-2 to the invading bacteria. McCormack et al. also show that some bacteria use a protein called a cell cycle inhibiting factor (or Cif for short) to inhibit the CRL complex. This blocks the ubiquitin labeling of Perforin-2, which renders it a useless weapon that can no longer be directed towards bacteria."

Also, mice that lacked Perforin-2 are highly susceptible to infectious diseases. McCormack et al.'s findings reveal how Perforin-2 is activated during the innate immune response and how some bacteria can defeat this pivotal defense. In the current age of antibiotic resistant bacteria, these studies may spur the development of new drugs that restore or increase the activity of Perforin-2."

                        "text": "As the largest class of ubiquitin ligases, cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) regulate numerous cellular processes including signal transduction, gene expression, development, and cell cycling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bosu and Kipreos, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Metzger et al., 2012</a>). CRLs are modular complexes that are assembled from a profusion of subunits. However, most share a similar architecture. At the core of each lies an elongated cullin upon which other CRL subunits assemble (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bosu and Kipreos, 2008</a>). Adaptor molecules bind to the cullin's extended amino-terminal domain and are themselves bound by receptors that provide substrate specificity (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cardozo and Pagano, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lydeard et al., 2013</a>). The RING subunit binds to the cullin's globular carboxy-terminal domain and acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for recruiting the complex's ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2). The placement of the substrate and E2 at opposite ends of the elongated cullin translates into a separation of \u223c50 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Merlet et al., 2009</a>). This gap prohibits ubiquitylation of the substrate. This problem is solved by an additional E2 enzyme, such as UBC12, that conjugates NEDD8, an 8.6 kDa member of the ubiquitin family of proteins (UniProt entry Q15843, Pfam identifier PF00240), to a conserved lysine within the carboxy-terminal domain of the cullin (<a href=\"#bib46\">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</a>). Cullin neddylation induces a conformational change that places the ubiquitin E2 and substrate in sufficient proximity for ubiquitylation to occur (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</a>). Thus, CRL-dependent ubiquitylation of a protein substrate is itself dependent upon cullin neddylation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Morimoto et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ohh et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sakata et al., 2007</a>)."

They are delivered to the cytosol of eukaryotic cells by type III secretion systems of some Gram-negative pathogens including <i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</i> and enteropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EPEC) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marches et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Charpentier and Oswald, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jubelin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Taieb et al., 2011</a>). Upon entering the cytosol Cifs proceed to deamidate Gln40 of NEDD8 thus producing a Glu residue at that position (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cui et al., 2010</a>). Because CRL activity is dependent upon NEDD8, this enzymatic modification prevents the ubiquitylation of CRL substrates (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marches et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Toro et al., 2013</a>). The discovery of Cif and elucidation of its enzymatic mechanism can be traced back to initial reports that certain pathogens cause cell cycle arrest (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Rycke et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nougayrede et al., 2001</a>). It is now known that Cif causes the accumulation of cell cycle inhibitors by blocking their ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marches et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Taieb et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Samba-Louaka et al., 2008</a>). It has been proposed that Cif mediated cell cycle arrest provides enteric pathogens, such as EPEC and <i>Y. pseudotuberculosis</i>, with a stable platform by decreasing the turnover rate of intestinal epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Samba-Louaka et al., 2009</a>). In theory this mechanism could promote colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. Although this is certainly a well reasoned hypothesis, to the best of our knowledge it remains untested. In addition, CRLs regulate diverse cellular processes. Although the majority of these processes probably have no role in limiting pathogen virulence, others may. Therefore, it is not yet known how the deamidation of NEDD8 by Cif contributes to pathogenicity."

For example, expression of Perforin-2 in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) is associated with the killing of intracellular <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar <i>Typhimurium</i> (hereafter <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>), methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium avium</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">McCormack et al., 2013b</a>). Moreover, siRNA knockdown of Perforin-2 expression abolished the ability of MEFs to destroy intracellular bacteria unless the siRNA transfected cells were also complemented with a siRNA resistant Perforin-2-RFP expression plasmid (<a href=\"#bib38\">McCormack et al., 2013b</a>). More recently, knockdown of Perforin-2 allowed <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>, an obligate intracellular pathogen that normally replicates within epithelial cells, to proliferate within mammalian macrophages (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fields et al., 2013</a>). In vivo, Perforin-2 is critical for protection against MRSA and <i>S. typhimurium</i> (<a href=\"#bib36a\">McCormack et al., 2015</a>)."

Nevertheless, Perforin-2 remains a poorly characterized molecule. To address this deficiency, we sought to characterize the molecular events required for the activation and deployment of Perforin-2 through a variety of in vitro and in vivo infection models. In this study we show that Perforin-2 is ubiquitylated by a CRL complex containing CUL1 and \u03b2TrCP in response to infectious bacteria or pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as LPS. Ubiquitylation triggers a rapid reorganization of Perforin-2-RFP within the cytosol and is absolutely required for its bactericidal activity. Due to its ability to inactivate CRLs, the bacterial effector protein Cif blocks ubiquitylation of Perforin-2 and its subsequent redistribution within infected cells. This blockade prevents Perforin-2-dependent killing of bacteria in vitro. In vivo, wild-type <i>Y. pseudotuberculosis</i> is significantly more virulent than a <i>cif</i> mutant. This difference was not observed with Perforin-2 deficient mice which succumb to an otherwise non-lethal dose of either wild-type or Cif<sup>\u2212</sup> bacteria. With regards to pathogenicity, these latter results suggest that the inhibition of Perforin-2-dependent killing is the primary function of Cif."

Moreover, crystallographic studies of MACPF domains have revealed structural similarities to bacterial pore-forming CDCs (cholesterol dependent cytolysins) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rosado et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rosado et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Slade et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Law et al., 2010</a>). Thus, the presence of a MACPF domain within Perforin-2 suggests that it may also have the ability to form lytic pores. This hypothesis is supported by the recovery of Perforin-2 from bacteria and images of pores with an average diameter of 100 \u00c5 in lipid membranes of mammalian cells expressing Perforin-2 and bacterial cell walls exposed to Perforin-2 (<a href=\"#bib36a\">McCormack et al., 2015</a>). The MACPF domain of Perforin-2 is immediately followed by a domain of unknown function (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We have dubbed this domain the Perforin-2 (P2) domain because it has been conserved throughout evolution in Perforin-2 orthologs and is only associated with the MACPF domain of Perforin-2. Although the function of the Perforin-2 domain remains to be elucidated, its conservation suggests that it is essential. The presence of a putative transmembrane alpha helix is an additional feature that distinguishes Perforin-2 from Perforin-1 and the pore-forming components of complement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Topological modeling and sequence analyses indicate that Perforin-2 is a type I transmembrane protein with a relatively short carboxy\u2013terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib38\">McCormack et al., 2013b</a>). The localization of Perforin-2 to vesicles staining with markers for endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, early endosomes, and plasma membrane is consistent with this prediction (<a href=\"#bib36a\">McCormack et al., 2015</a>)."

Therefore, we hypothesized that regulatory proteins may interact with the carboxy-terminal domain of Perforin-2 to govern its bactericidal activity. To identify these proteins we used Perforin-2's carboxy-terminal domain as bait for macrophage-expressed gene products in a yeast two-hybrid system and identified UBC12 as a Perforin-2-interacting protein. We then confirmed this interaction by coimmunoprecipitation of UBC12 with Perforin-2-GFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The addition of GFP, via a flexible linker, to the carboxy terminus of Perforin-2 was necessary because antibodies that immunoprecipitate native Perforin-2 are not available (<a href=\"#bib37\">McCormack et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2013b</a>).

Therefore, to exclude the possibility that the inhibition of Perforin-2 ubiquitylation is independent of NEDD8 deamidation we used site directed mutagenesis to change the codon of Cys117, which along with His173 and Gln193 forms the catalytic triad to Cif<sub>Yp</sub>, to an Ala codon. In contrast to the Cif<sub>Yp</sub>-FLAG expression plasmid, the Cif<sub>Yp</sub>-C117A-FLAG expression plasmid was unable to complement a <i>cif::aadA</i> mutation in <i>Y. pseudotuberculosis</i> even though the two proteins were expressed equally well (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, these results demonstrate that the deamidase activity of Cif is intrinsic to its ability to block ubiquitylation of Perforin-2.

As with C57Bl/6 \u00d7 129X1/SvJ mice, there was not a significant difference between Cif<sup>+</sup> and Cif<sup>\u2212</sup> <i>Y. pseudotuberculosis</i> in wild-type 129X1/SvJ mice; although, a few animals died in both cases (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>).

Because our results with 129X1/SvJ mice replicate those obtained with C57Bl/6 \u00d7 129X1/SvJ mice, we conclude that Perforin-2 deficiency is the primary cause of increased sensitivity to bacterial pathogens. Our results also demonstrate that Cif enhances pathogenicity primarily through the disruption of Perforin-2 activity and not through other pathways, such as cell cycling, that are known to be disrupted by Cif. The molecular mechanism of this effect is undoubtedly the blockade of NEDD8-dependent ubiquitylation of Perforin-2 by Cif, as suggested by our in vitro studies."

For example, polyubiquitylation through K48 linkages target proteins for degradation by the proteasome while K63 polyubiquitylation is often involved in cell signaling. Alternatively, ubiquitylation may terminate after the addition of a single ubiquitin molecule to the target protein. This is termed monoubiquitylation and typically serves as a sorting signal that directs the modified protein to one or more subcellular compartments. To determine the type of Perforin-2 ubiquitylation we probed Perforin-2-GFP immunoprecipitates with a linkage independent ubiquitin antibody (P4D1) as well as antibodies specific for K48 and K63 polyubiquitylation (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Consistent with previous results, the P4D1 antibody recognized Perforin-2-GFP immunoprecipitated from transfected knockout MEFs that were stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 and LPS. Ubiquitylation was not detected in the absence of LPS. In addition, MLN4924, a small molecule that inhibits cullin neddylation, also blocked LPS stimulated ubiquitylation of Perforin-2-GFP (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Soucy et al., 2009</a>). This latter result provides additional confirmation that Perforin-2 is ubiquitylated by a CRL complex. We estimate that ubiquitylation increases the mass of Perforin-2-GFP by \u226410 kDa (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given that ubiquitin has a mass of 8.5 kDa, this suggest that Perforin-2-GFP is monoubiquitylated. Since Perforin-2-GFP is a 105 kDa molecule, this relatively small increase in its mass also explains why mass shifts are not apparent on gels of less resolution; for example <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. Consistent with monoubiquitylation, antibodies specific for K48 or K63 polyubiquitylation did not recognize ubiquitylated Perforin-2-GFP (data not shown). Although other forms of polyubiquitylation through K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, or M1 linkages\u2014in addition to chains of mixed linkages\u2014are also possible, polyubiquitylation is inconsistent with the small increase in the mass of Perforin-2-GFP. This suggests monoubiquitylation serves as a sorting signal that directs Perforin-2 to a specific compartment within the cell or location on the plasma membrane."

Although we initially identified an interaction between UBC12 and Peforin-2 in a yeast two-hybrid screen, this result is rather curious as this NEDD8 conjugating enzyme is not thought to directly interact with CRL substrates. Thus, it is not clear if our initial two-hybrid hit reflects a bona fide or fortuitous interaction. Nevertheless, we subsequently demonstrated that Perforin-2 coimmunoprecipitates CUL1, UBC12, and \u03b2TrCP from lysates of mammalian cells. As an F-box substrate receptor, \u03b2TrCP may provide the primary and specific interaction between Perforin-2 and the CRL (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>). It is also likely that phosphorylation of Perforin-2 precedes its ubiquitylation because \u03b2TrCP has been shown to recognize phosphorylated substrates (<a href=\"#bib65\">Winston et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Strack et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2003</a>).

Thus, we conclude that PAMPs trigger CRL-dependent monoubiquitylation of Perforin-2's cytosolic domain. As described below, this conclusion is further supported by our studies with the bacterial effector protein Cif. Mutagenesis of conserved lysines within Perforin-2's carboxy-terminus also prevented its ubiquitylation and abolished its bactericidal activity. We have also shown that these mutations prevent the cellular redistribution of Perforin-2 in response to LPS. Likewise, we have shown that Cif blocks Perforin-2 trafficking. Because the destruction of bacteria involves a direct interaction between Perforin-2 and a bacterium, the inability of a cell to route Perforin-2 abolishes its bactericidal activity (<a href=\"#bib36a\">McCormack et al., 2015</a>)."

However its expression is not limited to professional phagocytes. In human and murine cells, including non-immune cells, the expression of Perforin-2 can be induced by interferons or intracellular bacteria (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fields et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">McCormack et al., 2013b</a>). The gene encoding Perforin-2 is evolutionarily ancient and is present in all but one species of bony vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib11\">D'Angelo et al., 2012</a>). As with mammalian Perforin-2, infectious bacteria also induce the expression of a Perforin-2 ortholog (MPEG1.2) in zebrafish. Although ubiquitylation was not investigated, upregulation of MPEG1.2 has been shown to require NF\u03baB and the TLR adaptor MyD88 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Benard et al., 2014</a>). In non-vertebrate species the expression of Perforin-2 orthologs is constitutive in some tissues and/or inducible by pathogenic bacteria or LPS (<a href=\"#bib19\">He et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kemp and Coyne, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bathige et al., 2014</a>).

In this study we have identified the bacterial effector protein Cif as one such example (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14C</a>). We have shown that Cif blocks ubiquitylation and trafficking of Perforin-2. This blockade prevents Perforin-2 from reaching the bacterium and explains how Cif inhibits Perforin-2-dependent killing in vitro and enhances pathogenicity in vivo. These properties are abolished by a mutation in the catalytic site of Cif<sub>Yp</sub>. An equivalent mutation has been previously shown to abolish the deamidase activity of Cif<sub>Ec</sub> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marches et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hsu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jubelin et al., 2009</a>). Because we have also demonstrated that the bactericidal activity of Perforin-2 is dependent upon its ubiquitylation by a CRL complex, we can conclude that Cif abolishes the bactericidal activity of Perforin-2 through deamidation of NEDD8 (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14C</a>). Moreover, the absence of Perforin-2 in <i>Mpeg1</i> knockout mice negated the benefit of Cif in vivo. Similar results were observed by siRNA knockdown of Perforin-2 expression in vitro. These results indicate that the inactivation of Perforin-2 is not a secondary or ancillary function of Cif. Rather, our results demonstrate that Cif enhances virulence primarily through inactivation of Perforin-2 as opposed to other mechanisms such as reduced turn-over of epithelial cells. Although Cif is the first definitive example of a bacterial product that blocks the bactericidal activity of Perforin-2, it is likely that others remain to be discovered."

In our accompanying manuscript we provide evidence that suggest Perforin-2 polymerizes and forms pores on bacteria adherent to the plasma membrane or within the endosomal lumen (<a href=\"#bib36a\">McCormack et al., 2015</a>). Thus, we propose a model in which monoubiquitylation of Perforin-2 initiates its trafficking towards bacteria at either location to facilitate Perforin-2-dependent destruction of bacterial pathogens. We also observed that the MACPF and P2 domains of Perforin-2 are cleaved from its transmembrane and cytosolic domains (<a href=\"#bib36a\">McCormack et al., 2015</a>). Although it is not yet known when cleavage occurs within the Perforin-2-dependent killing pathway, cleavage may explain the lack of colocalization of Perforin-2-RFP and Cif<sup>\u2212</sup> bacteria in confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). Although bacterial pathogens such as <i>Y. pseudotuberculosis</i> and EPEC block the critical event\u2014ubiquitylation\u2014that initiates the trafficking of Perforin-2 to its final destination, other pathogens may target events further upstream or downstream of ubiquitylation in order to preserve their cellular integrity and flourish."
