(<b>A</b>) When the tightrope walker (moving from left to right) has his/her front foot (red) in contact with the rope, the \u2018stepping gate\u2019 holds the red foot on the rope and keeps the rear foot (blue) away from the rope. (<b>B</b>) The blue foot moves in front of the red foot and the \u2018binding gate\u2019 allows the blue foot to contact the rope while preventing the red foot from coming away. (<b>C</b>) Now that the blue foot is in contact with the rope, the \u2018unbinding gate\u2019 allows the red (rear) foot to leave the rope while holding the blue foot in place. Cycling through these gates will ensure that at least one of the feet is tightly connected to the rope at all times, which allows the tightrope walker to cross the canyon safely. However, if any of these gates should fail, both feet may lose contact with the rope, resulting in a disastrous fall. This figure is based on the general gating framework for kinesin-1 by <a href=\"#bib1\">Andreasson et al. (2015)</a>."

This allows the heads to communicate in order to control their stepping, which is also called \u2018gating\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Block, 2007</a>)."

At each gate there is a mechanochemical transition that results in changes to the conformation of the neck linkers, the strength of the binding between the heads and the microtubule, and the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis. To explore the role of the gates in processive movement, Andreasson, Milic et al. compared wild type kinesin-1 motors and mutant kinesin-1 motors with longer neck linkers in a series of experiments: in particular, they measured how the speed of the motors, the run length (that is, the total distance moved) and the rate at which the heads detached from the microtubules depended on the force between the two heads."

However, the binding gate was more substantially affected, as was evident from the shorter run lengths of motors with a neck linker that was only one amino acid longer than normal."

The motors with longer neck linkers moved at a slower speed, but this could be partially restored by applying a force in the direction of motion. Andreasson, Milic et al. thus propose that, at the unbinding gate, it is not the tension between the heads that coordinates the mechanochemistry of the heads: rather, it is the spatial orientation of the neck linkers (in particular, the spatial orientation of the neck linker belonging to the front head) that is responsible for coordination."

It appears that the length of the neck linker is optimized for speed and processivity. In the future, it would be interesting to find out whether there are regulatory mechanisms in the cell that specifically affect the gates."

It will be an exciting challenge to understand how the mechanisms and structures of motor proteins are optimized for other characteristics of movement, such as the generation of force, or their ability to work together in teams."
