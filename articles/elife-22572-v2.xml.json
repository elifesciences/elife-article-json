AUG recognition evokes rearrangement of the PIC from an open, scanning to a closed, arrested conformation. Cryo-EM reconstructions of yeast PICs suggest remodeling of the interface between 40S protein Rps5/uS7 and eIF2\u03b1 between open and closed states; however, its importance was unknown. uS7 substitutions disrupting eIF2\u03b1 contacts favored in the open complex increase initiation at suboptimal sites, and uS7-S223D stabilizes TC binding to PICs reconstituted with a UUG start codon, indicating inappropriate rearrangement to the closed state. Conversely, uS7-D215 substitutions, perturbing uS7-eIF2\u03b1 interaction in the closed state, confer the opposite phenotypes of hyperaccuracy and (for D215L) accelerated TC dissociation from reconstituted PICs. Thus, remodeling of the uS7/eIF2\u03b1 interface appears to stabilize first the open, and then the closed state of the PIC to promote accurate AUG selection in vivo."

                        "text": "Accurate identification of the translation initiation codon is critical to ensure synthesis of the correct cellular proteins. In eukaryotic cells this process generally occurs by a scanning mechanism, wherein the small (40S) ribosomal subunit first recruits Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2-GTP in a reaction stimulated by eIFs 1, 1A, and 3. The resulting 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) attaches to the mRNA 5\u2019 end and scans the 5\u2019UTR for an AUG with favorable surrounding sequence, particularly at the \u22123 and\u00a0+4 positions, to identify the correct start codon and assemble a 48S PIC. In the scanning PIC, Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> is not tightly bound to the peptidyl (P) site of the 40S subunit, and this relatively unstable \u2018P<sub>OUT</sub>\u2019 state is thought to facilitate sampling of successive triplets entering the P site for complementarity to the anticodon of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>. The GTP bound to eIF2 in the TC can be hydrolyzed, dependent on GTPase activating protein eIF5, but P<sub>i</sub> release is blocked by eIF1, which also impedes full accommodation of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P site. Start codon recognition triggers dissociation of eIF1 from the 40S subunit, which gates P<sub>i</sub> release from eIF2-GDP\u00b7P<sub>i</sub> and permits highly stable binding of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the \u2018P<sub>IN</sub>\u2019 state. Interaction of the eIF1A NTT with the codon:anticodon duplex helps to stabilize the closed, P<sub>IN</sub> state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Subsequent dissociation of eIF2-GDP and other eIFs from the 48S PIC enables eIF5B-catalyzed subunit joining and formation of an 80S initiation complex with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> base-paired to AUG in the P site (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib12\">Hinnebusch (2014)</a>)."

Previously, we showed that substitutions of several residues in the \u03b2-hairpin of uS7 suppress the elevated UUG initiation conferred by Sui<sup>-</sup> variants of eIF2\u03b2 (<i>SUI3\u20132</i>) or eIF5 (<i>SUI5</i>), displaying the Ssu<sup>-</sup> (<span class=\"underline\">S</span>uppressor of <span class=\"underline\">Su</span>i<sup>-</sup>) phenotype. Consistent with this, one such Ssu<sup>-</sup> substitution in the hairpin loop (R148E, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) was found to destabilize TC binding to reconstituted 48S PICs containing a UUG start codon in the mRNA. Substitutions of Glu-144 in \u03b2-strand 1 of the hairpin, or the nearby residue Arg-225 at the C-terminus of uS7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), also reduced recognition of the AUG codon of eIF1 (<i>SUI1</i>) mRNA, present in poor context, and increased the probability that scanning PICs bypass, or \u2018leaky scan\u2019 past, the AUG codon of upstream open reading frame 1 (uORF1) in <i>GCN4</i> mRNA. The Glu-144 substitution (E144R) also dramatically destabilized TC binding to PICs reconstituted with an AUG or UUG start codon in mRNA, with a stronger effect for UUG (<a href=\"#bib32\">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</a>). Together, these findings implicated Arg-225 and amino acids in the uS7 \u03b2-hairpin, particularly Glu-144, in stabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> conformation of the PIC, and revealed a requirement for these residues in preventing selection of near-cognate (UUG) or AUG start codons in poor context in vivo (<a href=\"#bib32\">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</a>)."

Thus, it was unclear what molecular interactions in the PIC are perturbed by the E144R and R225K substitutions. Interestingly, both E144 and R225 interact with other uS7 residues located in the C-terminal helix, which in turn interacts extensively with eIF2\u03b1-D1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). As eIF2\u03b1-D1 also interacts with the anticodon stem-loop of tRNA<sub>i</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), we considered that the strong defects in start codon recognition conferred by E144R and R225K might result from an altered orientation of the uS7 C-terminal helix that perturbs its interaction with eIF2\u03b1-D1 in a way that indirectly destabilizes TC binding in the P<sub>IN</sub> state (<a href=\"#bib32\">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</a>). Because it was unknown whether the interface between eIF2\u03b1-D1 and the uS7 C-terminal helix is important for start codon recognition, we set out here to determine whether uS7 substitutions predicted to perturb this interface would alter the accuracy of start codon recognition in vivo."

The py48S-open complex exhibits an upward movement of the 40S head from the body that both widens the mRNA binding cleft and opens the entry channel latch, and evokes a widened P site lacking interactions between Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> and the 40S body found in py48S-closed. These features of py48S-open seem well-suited to the scanning of successive triplets entering the P site for complementarity to Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> with TC anchored in a relatively unstable conformation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ll\u00e1cer et al., 2015</a>). During the transition from py48S-open to py48S-closed, eIF2\u03b1-D1 rotates slightly to avoid a clash with the 40S body, which alters the interface between eIF2\u03b1-D1 and the C-terminal helix of uS7. Certain contacts appear to be enhanced in the open conformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; D77-R219 and D84-S223) and thus might be expected to promote continued scanning through UUG or \u2018poor-context\u2019 AUG codons and thereby increase initiation accuracy. A third contact (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; Y82-D215) is favored in the closed conformation and might have the opposite function of enabling recognition of suboptimal initiation sites by promoting the highly stable P<sub>IN</sub> conformation of TC binding to the closed complex. Thus, to examine the importance of the eIF2\u03b1-D1/uS7 interface in start codon recognition, we chose to perturb these predicted contacts that appear to be favored in one PIC conformation or the other and determine their effects on initiation at poor initiation codons in vivo and the stability of TC binding to reconstituted PICs in vitro. Our results support the physiological importance of the differential contacts between uS7 and eIF2\u03b1-D1 in the py48S-open and py48S-closed structures in modulating the transition to the P<sub>IN</sub> conformation by the scanning PIC and, hence, the accuracy of start codon selection."

Comparison of the py48S-open and \u2013closed structures (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ll\u00e1cer et al., 2015</a>) suggests that interactions of uS7 residues R219 and S223 with eIF2\u03b1 D77 and D84, respectively, are more favored in the open conformation, whereas uS7 D215 interaction with eIF2\u03b1 Y82 is more favored in the closed state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The <i>D215L</i> allele also suppresses the slow-growth phenotype conferred by <i>SUI5</i> on histidine-supplemented (+His) medium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, +His, rows 1 and 3), a known attribute of eIF1 Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations described previously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>).

These results suggest that replacing the acidic side chain of D215 with the hydrophobic side chains of Ala, Leu, or Phe perturbs the uS7/eIF2\u03b1-D1 interface in a way that impedes inappropriate transition to the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state at UUG start codons conferred by Sui<sup>-</sup> variants of eIF5 or eIF2\u03b2."

As such, they exacerbate the effects of the native, suboptimal context of the AUG codon of <i>SUI1</i> mRNA and decrease expression of the encoded eIF1 protein (<a href=\"#bib20\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>). All three D215 Ssu<sup>-</sup> substitutions similarly reduced eIF1 expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and, consistently, reduced expression of a <i>SUI1-lacZ</i> reporter bearing the native, suboptimal context at the nucleotides preceding the AUG codon (<sup>\u22123</sup>CGU<sup>\u22121</sup>), while modestly increasing expression of a modified <i>SUI1<sub>opt</sub>-lacZ</i> reporter with optimized context (<sup>\u22123</sup>AAA<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

Thus, the D215 substitutions exacerbate the effect of suboptimal context and decrease AUG recognition on native <i>SUI1</i> mRNA. The reduction in eIF1 abundance implies that the D215 substitutions overcome the autoregulation of eIF1 expression, wherein low eIF1 levels suppress poor context at the <i>SUI1</i> AUG codon to restore eIF1 abundance (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ivanov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>).

To determine whether E144R/R225K preferentially discriminate against uAUG-1 in poor context, we calculated their effects on the fraction of scanning ribosomes that initiate at el.uORF1 for each context of uAUG-1 in the manner shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> for D215L. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> , R225K and E144R both resemble D215L in preferentially decreasing el.uORF1 translation for weak and poor context versus\u00a0optimum context. In fact, E144R essentially eliminates recognition of uAUG-1 in poor context, while reducing it only slightly for optimum context (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> Fig. sup., cf. cols. 7 and 9). These findings support the possibility that uS7 R225K/E144R confer hyperaccurcy phenotypes by indirectly perturbing the uS7/eIF2\u03b1-I interface in the manner altered directly by the D215 substitutions."

We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the effects of the uS7 D215L substitution on TC binding to the 40S subunit in the yeast reconstituted translation system. We began by measuring the affinity of WT TC, assembled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, for 40S subunits harboring mutant or WT uS7 in the presence of saturating eIF1, eIF1A and a model unstructured mRNA containing an AUG start codon (mRNA(AUG)), using native gel electrophoresis to separate 40S-bound and unbound fractions of labeled TC. The 40S subunits were purified from <i>rps5\u0394::kanMX</i> deletion strains harboring either plasmid-borne <i>rps5-D215L</i> or <i>RPS5<sup>+</sup></i>as the only source of uS7. The reconstituted 40S\u2219eIF1\u2219eIF1A\u2219mRNA\u2219TC complexes will be referred to as partial 43S\u2219mRNA complexes owing to the absence of eIF3 and eIF5, which are dispensable for PIC assembly using these model mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Algire et al., 2002</a>). Reactions conducted with increasing concentrations of 40S subunits revealed that the partial 43S\u2219mRNA(AUG) complexes containing D215L or WT 40S subunits have K<sub>d</sub> values of\u00a0\u22641 nM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and D</a>). While this assay is not sensitive enough to detect decreases in TC affinity unless they exceed two-orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kolitz et al., 2009</a>), the results indicate that stable partial 43S\u2219mRNA(AUG) complexes can be assembled with D215L mutant 40S subunits. In the absence of mRNA, the affinities for TC were also similar between partial 43S PICs assembled with mutant or WT 40S subunits (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and D</a>)."

To measure the TC off-rate (k<sub>off</sub>), partial 43S\u2219mRNA complexes were formed as above using TC assembled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, and the amount of [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> remaining in the slowly-migrating PIC was measured at different times after adding a chase of excess unlabeled TC. To mimic the situation in vivo where <i>D215L</i> suppressed the Sui<sup>-</sup> phenotype of <i>SUI3\u20132</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), we measured the k<sub>off</sub> using eIF2 harboring the eIF2\u03b2 substitution (S264Y) encoded by <i>SUI3\u20132</i>. Consistent with our previous results (<a href=\"#bib22\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2014</a>), in reactions with WT 40S subunits, TC dissociates from AUG complexes very little over the time course of the experiment, yielding a rate constant of only 0.06 h<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; summarized in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). TC dissociation from WT PICs assembled on an otherwise identical mRNA containing a UUG start codon is also relatively slow (k<sub>off</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.10 h<sup>\u22121</sup>), owing to the stabilization of complexes at UUG codons conferred by the <i>SUI3\u20132</i> mutation in eIF2\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and E</a>). Importantly, the TC dissociation rates for partial 43S\u2219mRNA complexes assembled with <i>D215L</i> 40S subunits was increased\u00a0~3 fold for mRNA(AUG) and\u00a0~8 fold for mRNA(UUG) compared to the k<sub>off</sub> values of the corresponding WT complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and E</a>). These findings provide biochemical evidence that <i>D215L</i> destabilizes P<sub>IN</sub> at both AUG and UUG start codons with a relatively stronger effect on the near-cognate triplet, overriding the opposing effect of <i>SUI3\u20132</i> of enhancing the stability of the UUG complex. These in vitro findings are in accordance with the in vivo effects of <i>D215L</i> of reducing recognition of the <i>SUI1</i> AUG and <i>GCN4</i> uAUG-1 start codons, and suppressing the elevated UUG:AUG initiation ratio on <i>his4\u2013301</i> mRNA conferred by <i>SUI3\u20132</i>."

Consistently, they also confer increased expression of the <i>SUI1-lacZ</i> reporter with native, poor context. They also increase expression of <i>SUI1<sub>opt</sub>-lacZ</i> (with optimal context), but to a lesser degree, and thereby diminish the <i>SUI1<sub>opt</sub>-lacZ/ SUI1-lacZ</i> expression ratio (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). In accordance with its lack of Sui<sup>-</sup> phenotype, the <i>R219H</i> mutation has little or no effect on eIF1 expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) or the <i>SUI1<sub>opt</sub>-lacZ/ SUI1-lacZ</i> expression ratio (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Assaying expression of the <i>el.uORF1-GCN4-lacZ</i> reporters revealed that <i>R219D</i> confers decreased leaky scanning of uAUG-1 and attendant reduced translation of the downstream <i>GCN4-lacZ</i> ORF (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, cf. cols. 1\u20132). Calculating the fraction of scanning ribosomes that translate el.uORF1 indicates a substantial increase in recognition of uAUG-1 in poor context, a smaller increase with uAUG-1 in weak context, and a negligible change with uAUG-1 in optimal context (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, cf. columns 5\u20136). Thus, it appears that eliminating the basic side-chain of Arg-219 (R219A) or substituting it with an acidic side-chain (R219D) confers moderate or severe disruptions, respectively, of the uS7/eIF2\u03b1-D1 interface to facilitate inappropriate transition to the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state at both UUG codons and AUGs in poor-context. The relatively stronger phenotype of the Asp substitution of R219 might reflect electrostatic repulsion with D77 in eIF2\u03b1-D1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The Slg<sup>-</sup> phenotype of <i>rps5-R219D</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, +His, row 5) is associated with diminished polysome assembly, indicated by a reduced P/M ratio (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>); which does not arise from a reduction in 40S subunit abundance (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

A slower rate of TC recruitment allows 40S subunits that have translated uORF1 and resumed scanning to bypass the start codons of inhibitory uORFs 2\u20134 before rebinding TC, and then reinitiate further downstream at the <i>GCN4</i> AUG codon instead.

The fact that the Asp substitution produces a much stronger phenotype than the other three substitutions of S223 might arise from the introduction of electrostatic repulsion with Asp-84 in eIF2\u03b1-D1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>)."

We also measured rates of TC binding to these complexes (k<sub>on</sub>) by mixing labeled TC [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> with different concentrations of 40S subunits and saturating eIF1, eIF1A and mRNA(AUG) or mRNA(UUG), removing aliquots at different time points and terminating reactions with excess unlabeled TC. The amount of labeled TC incorporated into PICs as a function of time yields the pseudo-first-order rate constant (k<sub>obs</sub>) for each 40S concentration, and the slope of the plot of k<sub>obs</sub> versus 40S concentration yields the second-order rate constant (k<sub>on</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kolitz et al., 2009</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013F</a>, S223D increased the k<sub>on</sub> values for AUG and UUG PICs by\u00a0~2 fold and 4-fold, respectively. As the rate constant measured in these experiments is thought to be a composite of the rate of initial binding of TC to the PIC in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state followed by transition from P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kolitz et al., 2009</a>), the increase in k<sub>on</sub> conferred by S223D could indicate acceleration of one or both steps. However, considering that <i>S223D</i> confers a Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype in vivo (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), signifying a reduced rate of TC loading to 40S subunits (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hinnebusch, 2011</a>), and also appears to destabilize the P<sub>OUT</sub> state of TC binding to 43S complexes lacking mRNA (end-point defect in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013B</a>), it seems probable that the increased k<sub>on</sub> results from accelerating the transition from the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> states of TC binding to the PIC. This interpretation is supported by our finding that k<sub>on</sub> is increased more substantially for UUG versus AUG complexes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>), whereas the initial loading of TC on the PIC should be independent of the start codon (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kolitz et al., 2009</a>). In fact, the actual acceleration of P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> conversion conferred by <i>S223D</i> is likely to be substantially greater than the 2\u2013to 4-fold increases in measured k<sub>on</sub> values, as this effect would be offset by the decreased rates of TC binding in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state predicted by the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype of <i>S223D</i> in vivo. Thus, taken together, the results in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> provide biochemical evidence that <i>S223D</i> enhances conversion from the P<sub>OUT</sub> state to the highly stable P<sub>IN</sub> conformation at both AUG and UUG start codons, in accordance with the effects of this mutation in vivo of increasing recognition of the poor-context <i>SUI1</i> AUG codon and elevating near-cognate UUG initiation on <i>his4\u2013301</i> mRNA during ribosomal scanning."

Here, using a combination of genetics and biochemistry, we obtained strong evidence that uS7 influences start codon recognition through direct interactions with domain 1 of eIF2\u03b1. Structural analyses of reconstituted yeast PICs revealed that eIF2\u03b1-D1 interacts with both the anticodon stem of tRNA<sub>i</sub>, mRNA residues immediately upstream of the AUG codon, and the C-terminal helix of uS7, and suggested that the uS7/eIF2\u03b1-D1 interface is remodeled during the transition from the open conformation, thought to be conducive to scanning, to the closed state required for start codon recognition (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ll\u00e1cer et al., 2015</a>). We made targeted substitutions of uS7 residues whose contacts with specific amino acids in eIF2\u03b1-D1 appear to be favored in the open or closed conformation and thus might contribute differentially to the stabilities of these two states. As such, altering these contacts should have opposing effects on the probability of switching from the open, scanning conformation to the closed state at suboptimal start codons, including near-cognate UUG triplets and AUGs in poor surrounding context. Fulfilling these predictions would not only implicate the uS7/eIF2\u03b1-D1 interface in modulating start codon recognition, but also provide evidence that the different PIC conformations revealed by the structural studies represent physiological intermediates of the initiation pathway."

The potent uS7 substitution D215L was shown to destabilize the P<sub>IN</sub> state of TC binding to the PIC in vitro, using the <i>SUI3\u20132</i> variant of eIF2\u03b2 to assemble TC, increasing the dissociation rate of TC (k<sub>off</sub>) with a relatively stronger effect at UUG versus AUG start codons. These findings suggest that the uS7-D215/eIF2\u03b1-Y82 contact preferentially stabilizes the P<sub>IN</sub> state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and that perturbing this interaction disproportionately discriminates against suboptimal initiation sites whose P<sub>IN</sub> conformations are inherently less stable and thus hyperdependent on the uS7/eIF2\u03b1 interface present in the closed conformation for their\u00a0efficient utilization in cells. The D215L substitution resembles the E144R substitution in the uS7 \u03b2-hairpin loop in increasing discrimination against poor initiation codons and preferentially destabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> state at UUG codons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</a>), supporting the notion that altering the \u03b2-hairpin loop confers hyperaccurate initiation by indirectly perturbing the uS7/eIF2\u03b1-I interface in the closed PIC."

Moreover, the potent uS7 substitution S223D also had the opposite effect in vitro of stabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> state of TC binding to the 48S PIC, decreasing k<sub>off</sub> at UUG codons. Interestingly, uS7-S223D also accelerates formation of the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> complex, thus increasing k<sub>on</sub>; and the relatively stronger increase in k<sub>on</sub> observed for the UUG versus AUG complex suggests that the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition, rather than initial loading of TC to PIC, is accelerated by S223D. In fact, based on the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype conferred by <i>S223D</i> in vivo, the initial loading of TC in the P<sub>OUT</sub> configuration appears to be impaired by S223D. Together, these results suggest that uS7-S223D enhances the transition from the relatively less stable P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation to the more stable P<sub>IN</sub> state of TC binding by destabilizing the P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation, which decreases the rate of TC recruitment during reinitiation events on <i>GCN4</i> mRNA (to evoke the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype) and also enhances selection of suboptimal initiation codons during scanning,\u00a0including the native eIF1 start codon, <i>GCN4</i> uAUG-1 in poor context, and UUG start codons (the Sui<sup>-</sup> phenotype)."

Because eIF1 accelerates TC loading in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state but physically impedes the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition by clashing with tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P<sub>IN</sub> conformation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Passmore et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Rabl et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>), the reduced 40S association of these eIF1 variants reduces the rate of TC binding (Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype) and simultaneously enhances rearrangement to P<sub>IN</sub> at UUG codons (Sui<sup>-</sup> phenotype) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2013</a>). In the case of <i>rps5-S223D</i>, both the Gcd<sup>-</sup> and Sui<sup>-</sup> phenotypes likely result from weakening direct interaction of uS7 with eIF2\u03b1-D1 in the TC specifically in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state, which both delays TC loading and increases the probability of P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition. Unlike <i>S223D,</i> we found that the strong Sui<sup>-</sup> allele <i>rps5-R219D</i> does not confer a Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), which might indicate that the uS7-R219/eIF2\u03b1-D77 interaction in the open conformation is relatively more important for impeding the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition than for accelerating TC loading in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state."

The opposing consequences on initiation accuracy in vivo and the rates of TC dissociation from reconstituted partial PICs in vitro conferred by the uS7 substitutions D215L and S223D provides evidence that the distinct conformations of the uS7/eIF2\u03b1-D1 interface seen in the py48S-open and py48S-closed structures described by <a href=\"#bib18\">Ll\u00e1cer et al.

All \u03b2-galactosidase activity assays were performed with two technical replicates using the same extracts. To determine the UUG to AUG initiation ratio, matched <i>HIS4-lacZ</i> reporters with UUG or AUG as start codon were used. The sequence context of the start codon for both AUG and UUG <i>HIS4-lacZ</i> reporters is: 5\u2019-AUA(AUG/UUG)G-3\u2019. Four biological replicates (independent transformants) with two technical replicates were employed for all UUG to AUG ratio measurements, and the S.E.M.s for the ratios were calculated as (X/Y) (\u221a[(SE<sub>x</sub>/x)<sup>2</sup>+(SE<sub>y</sub>/y)<sup>2</sup>], where X, SE<sub>x</sub>, and x are the mean, standard error of the mean, and highest values for the UUG reporter, respectively; and Y, SE<sub>y</sub>, and y are the corresponding values for the AUG reporter). For Western analysis, WCEs from three biological replicates (independent cultures) were prepared by trichloroacetic acid extraction as described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Reid and Schatz, 1982</a>), and immunoblot analysis was conducted as described previously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>) with antibodies against eIF1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Val\u00e1sek et al., 2004</a>) or Gcd6 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bushman et al., 1993</a>).

Similarly, we were requested to look for suppression of the Rps5-S223D substitution with an eIF2\u03b1-D84S substitution. This an interesting suggestion; however, testing it would require the construction of a new strain in which mutant alleles of both RPS5 and the gene encoding eIF2\u03b1 (SUI2) can be combined in a double mutant, which is not a trivial matter. We began the construction of this strain, but have not been able to complete it yet. In addition, there are several reasons to think that the outcome of the proposed eIF2\u03b1 substitutions could be more complicated than imagined. Considering the proposed eIF2\u03b1-D77R substitution, we note first that eIF2\u03b1-D84 is within 8\u00c5 of eIF2\u03b1-D77 (refer to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and given the longer length of the Arg vs. Asp side-chain, a new salt bridge could be formed between the proposed eIF2\u03b1-D77R substitution and wild-type eIF2\u03b1-D84 rather than the intended salt bridge between eIF2\u03b1-D77R and Rps5-R219D. This in turn could prevent eIF2\u03b1-D84 from interacting with Rps5-S223 in the open complex and thus produce a Sui- phenotype indirectly. Second, eIF2\u03b1-D77 is within 4\u00c5 of eIF2\u03b1-Y82, and the proposed D77R substitution could impair the interaction of eIF2\u03b1-Y82 with Rps5-D215 in the closed complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and thus confer an Ssu<sup>-</sup> phenotype indirectly. Third, although not highlighted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, Rps5-R219 is within 4\u00c5 of eIF2\u03b1-Y82 exclusively in the open complex, and interaction between these residues might contribute to the stability of the open complex. If so, then our Rps5-R219D substitution might perturb interaction with eIF2\u03b1-Y82 as well as with eIF2\u03b1-D77, contributing to the strong Sui- phenotype of Rps5-R219D, in a way that could not be suppressed by the proposed eIF2\u03b1-D77R substitution."

As such, the proposed eIF2\u03b1-D84S substitution could destabilize both the open and closed states with offsetting effects. It is also relevant that these eIF2\u03b1 residues are probably located in or near the binding pocket for eIF2B and their substitutions could reduce eIF2 recycling and ternary complex formation, which could complicate their effects on accuracy. These uncertainties in the outcome make us reluctant to invest the considerable time and effort required to generate the appropriate SUI2 mutations, construct the double yeast mutants, and carry out the phenotypic tests to compare the double mutant to each single mutant. Instead, we think it would be more profitable to carry out a random mutagenesis of the SUI2 gene and select for mutations that suppress the Sui- phenotype of the Rps5-R219D mutation. This interesting project would be possible once the aforementioned yeast strain can be constructed, but is beyond the scope of the present work."

It is particularly notable that the Rps5-S223D substitution confers greater than WT stability of TC binding (reduced k<sub>OFF</sub>) (Figure 9C-D), and a greater than WT rate of TC binding in the P<sub>IN</sub> state exclusively at UUG codons (Figure 9E-F); and it seems difficult to imagine that the non-specific effects of this mutation on Rps5 structure envisioned by the referee would produce mutant 40S subunits that perform better than WT subunits in accessing and maintaining a stable P<sub>IN</sub> complex."

While not depleted to the same extent in the inoculum for spotting assays, cells will grow for 10-20 additional generations in glucose when forming colonies from single cells in this assay, which will deplete endogenous Rps5 to a much greater degree. Thus, we are confident that the overwhelming majority of Rps5 present in our glucose-grown cultures is plasmid-encoded. It is not surprising that a small fraction of Rps5 expressed from the pGAL-RPS5 allele remains detectable after prolonged growth on glucose medium. This explains why we did not use this depletion system when purifying the mutant ribosomes needed for biochemical analysis, but rather constructed strains in which chromosomal RPS5 was deleted and the mutant allele was the only source of Rps5 in the cells."
