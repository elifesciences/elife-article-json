This led to altered visualization of the summary statistics for the model\u2019s behaviour. The error was not present in the code file used to fit the model to behavioural data or calculate its goodness of fit, and so does not affect any quantitative metrics presented in the article. Additionally, due to an oversight the source code for the ideal observer model was not included in the originally published article. The correct code is now available."
