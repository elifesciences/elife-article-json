We identified 53,613,739 unique sRNAs and 165,797 sRNA expression traits (s-traits). A total of 66,649 s-traits mapped 40,049 <i>local</i>-sQTLs and 30,809 <i>distant</i>-sQTLs. By defining 80,362 sRNA clusters, 22,263 sRNA cluster QTLs (scQTLs) were recovered for 20,249 of all the 50,139 sRNA cluster expression traits (sc-traits). The expression levels for most of s-traits from the same genes or the same sRNA clusters were slightly positively correlated. While genetic co-regulation between sRNAs from the same mother genes and between sRNAs and their mother genes was observed for a portion of the sRNAs, most of the sRNAs and their mother genes showed little co-regulation. Some sRNA biogenesis genes were located in <i>distant</i>-sQTL hotspots and showed correspondence with specific length classes of sRNAs suggesting their important roles in the regulation and biogenesis of the sRNAs."

We identified 53,613,739 unique sRNAs and 165,797 sRNA expression traits (s-traits). A total of 66,649 s-traits mapped 40,049 <i>local</i>-sQTLs and 30,809 <i>distant</i>-sQTLs. By defining 80,362 sRNA clusters, 22,263 sRNA cluster QTLs (scQTLs) were recovered for 20,249 of all the 50,139 sRNA cluster expression traits (sc-traits). The expression levels for most of s-traits from the same genes or the same sRNA clusters were slightly positively correlated. While genetic co-regulation between sRNAs from the same mother genes and between sRNAs and their mother genes was observed for a portion of the sRNAs, most of the sRNAs and their mother genes showed little co-regulation. Some sRNA biogenesis genes were located in <i>distant</i>-sQTL hotspots and showed correspondence with specific length classes of sRNAs suggesting their important roles in the regulation and biogenesis of the sRNAs."

The analysis identified over 53 million sRNA molecules from a population of rice plants. Many of these sRNAs varied in their abundance between different plants within the population. Wang, Yao et al. also found many thousands of individual instructions within the DNA of the rice that can either increase or reduce the abundance of their associated sRNA."

According to their origin, sRNAs can be grouped into two major types: hpRNAs that are derived from single-stranded precursors with a hairpin structure (such as microRNAs [miRNAs]) and short interfering RNA (siRNAs) that are derived from double-stranded RNA precursors such as heterochromatic small interfering RNAs (hc-siRNA) and <i>trans</i>-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNA). There has been an explosion of interest in recent years in studies of miRNAs and siRNAs on their identification, biogenesis, and functioning in diverse biological processes. In plants, sRNAs function in regulating growth, development (<a href=\"#bib27\">Juarez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhu and Helliwell, 2011</a>), architecture (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jiao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Miura et al., 2010</a>), yield (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>), and response to biotic and abiotic stresses (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Shukla et al., 2008</a>). Such regulations are usually achieved by mediating endogenous mRNA cleavage and decay, DNA methylation of source and target loci, and chromatin modification and transcriptional silencing (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arikit et al., 2013</a>)."

It is also known that the abundance of sRNA species can be highly variable among individuals within a species, and the possible regulatory role of such quantitative difference has been assumed (<a href=\"#bib21\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Groszmann et al., 2011b</a>). It is not known whether the quantitative variation of sRNA species between genotypes is related to the biological machinery, as quantitative variation of sRNAs has not been assayed at the population level and their genetic control has yet to be elucidated."

This approach can also be applied to the genetic analysis of quantitative variation of sRNAs by regarding the abundance of the sRNAs in the population as quantitative traits. Once the QTLs are identified, subsequent studies can be pursued very much the same way as the analysis of genes and regulatory networks underpinning phenotypic QTLs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Xing and Zhang, 2010</a>)."

An sRNA with RPM value \u22650.6 was regarded as expressed, and an sRNA identified as expressed in more than 25 of the 98 IMF2s was regarded as an sRNA expression trait (s-trait). In this way, a total of 165,797 s-traits were recovered (Supplementary file 3 in Dryad [<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2015</a>]). A total of 87.9% of s-traits were 24 nt (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The s-traits mainly originated from the intergenic regions, 2-kb upstream, and genic regions of non-transposon genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Although the 2-kb upstream and the genic regions of non-transposon genes contained almost equal number of sRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the number of s-traits derived from the 2-kb upstream of non-transposon genes was more than twice of the number of s-traits in genic regions of non-transposon genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The distribution of different species s-traits in different genomic regions was similar to that of sRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,H</a>). Although sRNAs of various lengths from genic regions were mostly from exons of non-transposon genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), the s-traits of different sizes were mainly derived from introns of non-transposon genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). The coefficients of variation of the 165,797 s-traits (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) showed a very wide range of distribution of the sRNA levels in the population. We selected 9 s-traits randomly from all the 165,797 s-traits, and the distributions of the expression values for most of these s-traits across the IMF2 population were more or less normal (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

A total of 3,739,873 correlation coefficients involving 15,078 genes and 96,914 s-traits were obtained, 2,593,503 (69.3%) and 507,528 (13.6%) of which were contributed by 2278 s-traits from genes LOC_Os03g01360 and 1008 s-traits from LOC_Os07g01240, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The correlation coefficients naturally fell into three classes: strong negative correlations, no correlation, and strong positive correlations with obvious dividing points at \u22120.3 and 0.3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), which were far above 0.25, the threshold for statistical significance at p &lt; 0.05 determined by simulation data. While 85.8% of these strong correlations (positive or negative) were contributed by s-traits originated from LOC_Os03g01360 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), most of s-traits originated from gene LOC_Os07g01240 showed low (or no) correlations with each other (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Although the expression values of s-traits originated from the same regions of the remaining 15,076 genes in the whole genome were mostly slightly positively correlated, the correlation coefficients were significantly distinct from that of the simulation of random data (Mann\u2013Whitney U test, p-value &lt;2.2e-16, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), indicating various degrees of correlations. We found that the correlations were affected by the sizes of s-traits (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Expression correlations between s-traits of the same size were stronger than that between s-traits of different sizes. In particular, the expression correlations between 21-nt sRNAs and 25-nt sRNAs from the same genes were very weak. The correlations between overlapped s-traits were slightly stronger than that between s-traits not overlapping with each other (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). The correlations between s-traits from the same transposons were slightly different from that of s-traits from the same non-transposons genes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). Most of the s-traits originating from LOC_Os03g01360 were significantly correlated (positive or negative) with each other (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and the correlations between different s-traits were mainly dependent on their genomic positions rather than their sizes, which were mostly 21, 22, and 24 nt, accounting for 40.2%, 34.4%, and 19.4% of the 2278 s-traits. This gene could be separated as three parts, the 2 kb-upstream, 5\u2032 UTR, the first intron and the first coding DNA sequence (CDS) as the first part, the most of the second intron comprising the second part, and the second CDS and part of the second intron as the third part (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). s-traits within each part were positively correlated with each other, while s-traits from the first part were mostly negatively correlated with those from the other two parts. The correlations between the expression levels of s-traits from the second parts and s-traits from the third parts were mostly positive. Thus, although very strong positive and negative correlations were found between sRNAs from the same genic regions of specific genes, this was not a common phenomenon. Taken together, this correlation analysis indicated that most of the sRNAs derived from the same genes were correlated with each other to various extents, implying that nearby sRNAs were possibly jointly transcribed. Consecutively overlapped sRNAs were found from introns of specific genes and intergenic regions, indicating that sRNAs were not necessarily jointly transcribed from the genes."

With a false discovery rate (FDR) set at 5%, a total of 70,858 sQTLs were recovered for 66,649 s-traits (Supplementary file 7 in Dryad [<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2015</a>]). These sQTLs were classified as <i>local</i>-sQTLs and <i>distant</i>-sQTLs, which were also referred to as <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-QTLs, respectively, in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2014</a>), according to their locations relative to the s-traits. A <i>local</i>-sQTL indicated the existence of local functional polymorphism(s) that could influence the abundance of the s-trait, and a <i>distant</i>-sQTL meant the s-trait expression variation in the population was controlled by regulatory element(s) distant from the s-trait precursor sequence. For defining a <i>local</i>-sQTL, we adopted a 1.5 LOD-drop support interval of the corresponding sQTL or no more than 250 kb from the closest marker in a recombination sparse region. Otherwise, it was regarded as a <i>distant</i>-sQTL (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yvert et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Morley et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Keurentjes et al., 2007</a>). Such classification resulted in 40,049 <i>local</i>-sQTLs (shown in the diagonal of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and 30,809 <i>distant</i>-sQTLs (off-diagonal of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) (Supplementary file 7 in Dryad [<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2015</a>]). Expression variations of s-traits explained by <i>local</i>-sQTLs were substantially higher than that by <i>distant</i>-sQTLs (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The LOD values for 80.4% of the <i>local</i>-sQTLs and 34.5% of <i>distant</i>-sQTLs were larger than 10."

                                "text": "We took a closer look at the two loci that contributed extremely high numbers of sRNAs. Approximately 97.4% (2278) of the s-traits produced by Bin358 were encoded by the 2-kb upstream and genic region of the locus LOC_Os03g01360, where the sRNA sequences showed extensive and consecutive overlapping (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). LOC_Os03g01360 did not have homologs in <i>Arabidopsis</i> but had a homolog in maize with unknown function (<a href=\"http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g01360\">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g01360</a>). Three isoforms of this gene were significantly differentially expressed as measured in FPKM between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The sRNAs of Zhenshan 97 were mainly derived from the second and the third part of LOC_Os03g01360, while sRNAs of Minghui 63 originated from all the three parts with the expression level from the third part lower than that of sRNAs of Zhenshan 97 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The expression levels of LOC_Os03g01360.1 and LOC_Os03g01360.4 in the genome of Minghui 63 were higher than Zhenshan 97 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). On the contrary, LOC_Os03g01360.2 was higher expressed in Zhenshan 97 than in Minghui 63. The expression of all the three transcripts in the hybrid was down-regulated compared with the mid-parent value (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We checked the cytosine methylation levels in this region, and the genomic DNA showed high cytosine methylation, especially from the start to the third exon (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This high methylation might be due to the enrichment of sRNAs resulting in RNA-directed DNA methylation. In the differentially expressed region of sRNAs between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63, such as the third exon according to the annotated gene model, Minghui 63 had lower methylation and higher mRNA transcript level than Zhenshan 97, suggesting a negative correlation between the transcript level and methylation. The expression variation of three isoforms of LOC_Os03g01360 in the IMF2 population was controlled by <i>local</i>-eQTLs (Supplementary file 7 in Dryad [<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2015</a>]). At least one sQTL each was detected for 2200 of the 2278 s-traits located in the gene LOC_Os03g01360 region, of which 2181 (84.5%) were <i>local</i>-sQTLs (Supplementary file 7 in Dryad [<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2015</a>]). The expression variation of different transcripts of LOC_Os03g01360 probably corresponded to sRNAs from specific parts of the genic region and is regulated by the same genetic factor. The majority of <i>distant</i>-sQTLs regulating the expression of s-traits originating from LOC_Os03g01360 was for 21 and 22 nt s-traits and was attributed to Bin442\u2013Bin453 on chromosome 3."

Our results indicated that almost one third of the detected <i>local</i>-sQTLs exhibited much larger effects than <i>distant</i>-sQTLs, consistent with the studies for eQTL of mRNA expression (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kliebenstein, 2009</a>), suggesting that local elements are a major regulatory factor for sRNA variation. <i>Local</i>-QTLs regulating the expression of large numbers of traits were observed for s-traits but not for e-traits, resulting from the enrichment of s-traits in the region produced by the extensive and consecutive overlapping transcripts from the mother genes.

Moreover, the large number of <i>distant</i>-sQTLs that were not collocated with the <i>distant</i>-eQTLs for the corresponding mother genes supported the independent regulatory basis of the transcription of the sRNAs."

This is in accordance with the reports that RDRs function on the upstream of DCLs in the process of sRNA biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chapman and Carrington, 2007</a>). Studies in sRNA pathways in <i>Arabidopsis</i> showed that DCL2 is responsible for the synthesis of 22 nt or 24 nt siRNAs, while RDR2 functions in the production of endogenous 24 nt siRNAs and the conversion of ssRNA template into dsRNAs that serve as substrates for DCLs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arikit et al., 2013</a>), which is in good agreement with the sQTLs found in this study. However, it should also be noted that these genes were associated with s-QTLs for only a small portions of the s-traits, while the quantitative variation of the sRNA abundance for majority of the s-traits was independent of the sRNA biogenesis genes."

Studies of transcript levels of genes (mRNAs) in the hybrid against the parents in the same rice cross also revealed more negative dominance than positive dominance, also indicating down-regulation in the hybrid relative to the parents (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2006</a>).

Bowtie (<a href=\"#bib32\">Langmead et al., 2009</a>) was used to align short reads to each genome at unique genome location with no mismatch allowed. The reads from heterozygous materials could be divided into three groups: reads specifically mapped to Zhenshan 97, reads only mapped to Minghui 63 genome, and reads mapped to both Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 at the same position. In the third class, the sequences of the sRNAs from a monomorphic site were indistinguishable between the parents and thus obtained one count in quantitation of the abundance, whereas the two counts of the sRNAs from a polymorphic site were put together."

Although numerous eQTL analyses have been previously performed, the novelty is here that they look specifically to the abundance of small RNAs and that has never been done before.
