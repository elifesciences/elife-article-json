In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> vernalization depends on the cold-induced epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor locus <i>FLC</i>. Extensive natural variation in vernalization response is associated with <i>A. thaliana</i> accessions collected from different geographical regions. Here, we analyse natural variation for vernalization temperature requirement in accessions, including those from the northern limit of the <i>A. thaliana</i> range. Vernalization required temperatures above 0\u00b0C and was still relatively effective at 14\u00b0C in all the accessions.

One Northern Swedish accession showed maximum vernalization at 8\u00b0C, both at the level of flowering time and <i>FLC</i> chromatin silencing. Historical temperature records predicted all accessions would vernalize in autumn in N. Sweden, a prediction we validated in field transplantation experiments. The vernalization response of the different accessions was monitored over three intervals in the field and found to match that when the average field temperature was given as a constant condition. The vernalization temperature range of 0\u201314\u00b0C meant all accessions fully vernalized before snowfall in N. Sweden.

One aspect of this is the alignment of developmental transitions with seasonal cues. A major seasonal cue is temperature and plants have evolved the ability to integrate daily fluctuations in external temperature in order to monitor long-term trends (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aikawa et al., 2010</a>). Exposure to weeks of cold temperature accelerates the transition to flowering in a process called vernalization. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> vernalization involves the quantitative epigenetic silencing of <i>FLC</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Michaels and Amasino, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Sheldon et al., 1999</a>). Cold exposure promotes a cell-autonomous epigenetic switch at <i>FLC</i> in an increasing proportion of cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Angel et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2015</a>). This epigenetic switching mechanism requires a Polycomb complex associated with PHD proteins (<a href=\"#bib23\">De Lucia et al., 2008</a>), including the cold-induced VIN3 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Sung and Amasino, 2004</a>). This enables activation of <i>FT</i>, is a potent activator of flowering in <i>A. thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Searle et al., 2006</a>). At a standard vernalization temperature of 5\u00b0C, the length of cold required to achieve complete epigenetic silencing varies between <i>A. thaliana</i> accessions and this maps to non-coding cis polymorphisms in <i>FLC</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coustham et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Li et al., 2014</a>)<i>.</i> Accessions collected from northerly latitudes typically require longer vernalization, for example, the accession Lov-1 originates from near the northerly limit of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> range in L\u00f6vvik, North Sweden (62.5\u00b0N) and requires three months of vernalization to fully accelerate flowering (<a href=\"#bib15\">Shindo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Coustham et al., 2012</a>)."

A genetically informed photothermal model for flowering in <i>A. thaliana</i> has assumed that vernalization occurs when daytime hourly temperatures are higher than 0\u00b0C and lower than 6\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib18\">Wilczek et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chew et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2014</a>). However, accessions from southern Europe have been found to vernalize at constant temperatures significantly higher than 6\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib19\">Wollenberg and Amasino, 2012</a>), suggesting that accessions from northerly latitudes might vernalize most efficiently at relatively low temperatures. Here, we show this is not the case and find that vernalization in a range of <i>A. thaliana</i> accessions is most effective across a relatively high temperature range with the N. Swedish accession Lov-1, showing maximal vernalization at 8\u00b0C. We show that vernalization is complete before snowfall in N. Sweden with the plants flowering immediately upon snowmelt. Vernalization responsiveness in the field matched that when the average monthly temperature was given as constant conditions. Our work has important implications for modeling flowering time and predicting the impact of climate change."

Sweden\u2014latitude 62.5\u00b0N), Var2-6 (V\u00e5rhallen, S. Sweden\u2014latitude 55.58\u00b0N), Ull2-5 (Ullstorp, S.

All genotypes were vernalized for varying periods at different constant temperatures between 0\u00b0C and 14\u00b0C and the efficiency of vernalization assayed by determining flowering time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A-E</a>). All the genotypes showed limited vernalization after 4 and 6 weeks exposure to 0\u00b0C and vernalized more efficiently at all other temperatures. Col <i>FRI</i><sup>Sf2</sup> and Edi-0 were most effectively vernalized after 4, 6 or 12 weeks at 2\u00b0C, 5\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C and still vernalized relatively efficiently at 12\u00b0C and 14\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and C</a>). Even after 2 weeks of cold at 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C the flowering of Col <i>FRI</i><sup>Sf2</sup> plants was similar, so lack of any difference was not due to vernalization being close to saturation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Ull2-5 showed similar temperature sensitivity to Col <i>FRI</i><sup>Sf2</sup> and Edi-0, but required 12 weeks for vernalization to be fully effective (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In contrast, Lov-1 and Var2-6 plants showed a differential response to temperature with 2 and 12\u00b0C less effective than 5 and 8\u00b0C after 6-weeks vernalization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and E</a>). For Lov-1 the only temperature that resulted in flowering after 4 weeks exposure was 8\u00b0C and although the enhanced effect of this temperature diminished over time, 8\u00b0C consistently resulted in the most effective vernalization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Thus, the different accessions show distinct temperature profiles for vernalization and all require temperatures higher than 0\u00b0C."

We compared this quantitative variation in the silencing of Col <i>FRI</i><sup>Sf2</sup> and Lov-1 <i>FLC</i> alleles after 4 weeks cold exposure at 2, 5, 8, 12 and 14\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). In contrast to Col <i>FRI</i><sup>Sf2</sup>, the Lov-1 allele re-activated after 30 days in the warm after vernalization at all the tested temperatures. However, the degree of re-activation was lowest after vernalization at 8\u00b0C, consistent with vernalization being most effective at this temperature. Similarly, 6 weeks vernalization at 8\u00b0C resulted in lower <i>FLC</i> re-activation post-cold and higher levels of <i>FT</i> induction than 5\u00b0C, with similar <i>VIN3</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Epigenetic silencing of <i>FLC</i> is associated with Polycomb silencing and accumulation of H3K27me3 over the gene body (<a href=\"#bib3\">Angel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). In Lov-1 it takes longer to accumulate the H3K27me3, mainly due to lower starting levels (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coustham et al., 2012</a>). We found similar accumulation of gene body H3K27me3 in the Col <i>FRI</i><sup>Sf2</sup> <i>FLC</i> allele at 5, 8 or 14\u00b0C, but differential H3K27me3 accumulation in the Lov-1 allele (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Vernalization at 8\u00b0C resulted in higher levels of H3K27me3 compared to 5 or 14\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), suggesting that the Polycomb silencing is most effective at 8\u00b0C for the Lov-1 <i>FLC</i> allele."

Swedish L\u00f6vvik site (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This early flowering may limit herbivory and help in the competition for nutrients (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kawagoe and Kudoh, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akiyama and Agren, 2012</a>). A long-term (&gt;5 year study) of the natural populations at several N. Swedish sites throughout the High Coast region, showed most populations behaved as winter annuals with germination occurring predominantly in August and September with no spring germination (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). The rapid flowering after snowmelt suggests that vernalization must have occurred before the end of November given the recurrent snow cover and low temperatures at the L\u00f6vvik site over the winter months (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Hourly climate data collected near L\u00f6vvik between 1st August (the earliest germination date observed for natural populations) until snow cover between 2008 and 2013 show an average air temperature of ~8\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Analysis of national data (1st August\u201430th November) also revealed an overall average autumn daily average temperature of 8.86\u00b0C between 1961 and 2008 (SD = 0.63) with over 86% of days falling within the range identified as being effective for Lov-1 vernalization, (0\u00b0C, 15\u00b0C) (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>).

It was therefore interesting that the optimal vernalizing temperature for Lov-1 matched the average temperature over the 3-month season when vernalization occurred (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We therefore compared vernalization response in the different transplant intervals with vernalization in constant temperatures equivalent to the average temperature of the field conditions (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). The different genotypes showed temporal differences in vernalization responsiveness over the three transplant periods in the field. Remarkably, vernalization responsiveness was very similar when the average field temperature was given as a constant temperature, with each genotype showing a different overall profile (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Indeed, the match is remarkable given the daily oscillations in temperature especially in the transplant 1 period (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). How plants integrate these fluctuating temperatures over such long timescales is an important area for future molecular dissection."

Sweden generally have much lower seed dormancy requirement than those from further south (<a href=\"#bib22\">Debieu et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the low seed dormancy of Lov-1 would enable germination to occur early enough to exploit the whole of the N. Swedish autumn for vernalization. The increased seed dormancy of S. Swedish accessions (e.g., Ull2-5) is likely to delay germination leading to the necessity for vernalization in some years to extend into winter in S. Sweden. It is interesting to speculate that the reduced effectiveness of temperatures below 5\u00b0C for other Swedish accessions Lov-1 and Var2-6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,E</a>) could prevent premature vernalization occurring during unseasonal cool periods in early autumn. Our data also show that the (0\u00b0C, 6\u00b0C) temperature range widely used to estimate vernalization in <i>A. thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Wilczek et al., 2009</a>) would only predict partial vernalization of later flowering accessions during our field experiments (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our data suggest that raising the upper threshold temperature to 15\u00b0C would improve estimates of vernalization progress for later flowering accessions under natural field conditions."

We show that growth at the northern limit of the <i>A. thaliana</i> species range has involved a seasonal shift in the timing of vernalization. Perhaps as a response to selection in these extreme conditions one N. Swedish accession, Lov-1, shows a more distinct vernalization temperature optimum that matches the average historical temperature for August-November in that geographical region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Early germination enables vernalization to complete before snowfall and allows flowering to occur directly after snowmelt when the photoperiod and ambient temperatures increase. Rises in global temperature have already reduced vernalization periods to an extent that has impacted the phenology of a range of plant species (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Cook et al., 2012</a>). Studies such as this are therefore important to understand how rapidly populations might adapt under future climate scenarios."

The work addresses the question whether accessions of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> complete vernalization at different times relative to the height of winter, as a consequence of adaptation to geographic differences in winter temperatures and winter duration. A model presented in many reviews is that vernalization equates exposure to winter-like temperature, and thus is completed only in spring. It is, however, unclear how rigorously this has been tested before. A previous paper by Wollenberg and Amasino reported that flowering of some Spanish accessions is accelerated by transient exposure to quite high vernalization temperatures, and M\u00e9ndez-Vigo et al. have hypothesized that \u201cmild and moderately cold winters activate the vernalization pathway to promote flowering in winter\u201d (of Spanish accessions)."

Depending on which NIL is used as the denominator, this is either a 30% or a 60% delay.

A surprising observation is that vernalization is already completed during fall at a rather higher temperature of about 8\u00b0C, which enables very rapid flowering opening after snow melt. This is a potentially exciting new insight because vernalization has been typically considered to occur during winter to prevent early flowering. What is lacking, however, is a demonstration that these prior assumptions were justified, and that the Lov-1 allele has indeed a different vernalization temperature optimum in addition to its different vernalization length requirement. What impressed the reviewers most was the very clever idea to take plants grown at natural field sites into the greenhouse, in order to test their vernalization status. This nicely confirms that Lov-1 needs longer vernalization than the reference strain, although this is perhaps difficult to interpret because the reference strain flowers so much more quickly anyway."

In this paper, you have asked whether there are also different temperature optima for vernalization. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, you contrast a line with the FLC standard allele, Col FRI-Sf2, with the Lov-1 line. You find that in both lines 2, 5, or 8\u00b0C are more effective for vernalization than temperatures below or above. The critical question is whether there are differences between the two lines at 12 and 14\u00b0C. Because the effect of vernalization on flowering of the reference line is much smaller than for Lov-1, the reviewers were unconvinced of this claim. Not only was there no proper statistical treatment, but it is even unclear whether this can be resolved by statistics, because it would be rather arbitrary how one defines vernalization response, i.e., as absolute difference in flowering, relative acceleration of flowering etc. More importantly, the reviewers agreed that these experiments mostly confirmed that Lov-1 needs to be vernalized much longer than Col FRI-Sf2 rather than that the results demonstrated a different temperature optimum. That there is perhaps less of a difference between the different temperature regimens than claimed can also be deduced from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. If one of the lines has a temperature optimum at 2-8\u00b0C, it would seem to be Col FRI-Sf2, not Lov-1, where 12\u00b0C seems to be more effective in reducing FLC expression than in Col FRI-Sf2. The H3K27me3 data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> are more in support of differential temperature effects, but the differences between 5 and 8\u00b0C for Lov-1 are not reflected in obvious differences in flowering behavior, so the results are equivocal."
