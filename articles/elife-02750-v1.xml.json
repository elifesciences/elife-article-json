We present novel experiments in which two micropipette-held somatic cells of <i>Volvox carteri</i>, with distinct intrinsic beating frequencies, are studied by high-speed imaging as a function of their separation and orientation. Analysis of time series shows that the interflagellar coupling, constrained by lack of connections between cells to be hydrodynamical, exhibits a spatial dependence consistent with theory. At close spacings it produces robust synchrony for thousands of beats, while at increasing separations synchrony is degraded by stochastic processes. Manipulation of the relative flagellar orientation reveals in-phase and antiphase states, consistent with dynamical theories. Flagellar tracking with exquisite precision reveals waveform changes that result from hydrodynamic coupling. This study proves unequivocally that flagella coupled solely through a fluid can achieve robust synchrony despite differences in their intrinsic properties."

We present novel experiments in which two micropipette-held somatic cells of <i>Volvox carteri</i>, with distinct intrinsic beating frequencies, are studied by high-speed imaging as a function of their separation and orientation. Analysis of time series shows that the interflagellar coupling, constrained by lack of connections between cells to be hydrodynamical, exhibits a spatial dependence consistent with theory. At close spacings it produces robust synchrony for thousands of beats, while at increasing separations synchrony is degraded by stochastic processes. Manipulation of the relative flagellar orientation reveals in-phase and antiphase states, consistent with dynamical theories. Flagellar tracking with exquisite precision reveals waveform changes that result from hydrodynamic coupling. This study proves unequivocally that flagella coupled solely through a fluid can achieve robust synchrony despite differences in their intrinsic properties."

One of the earliest experimental results was Rothschild's qualitative observation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rothschild, 1949</a>) that the flagella of bull spermatozoa tend to synchronize when they swim close to one another, coupled only through the fluid surrounding them. Much more recent observations of self-organised vortex arrays of swimming sea urchin spermatazoa near surfaces (<a href=\"#bib29\">Riedel et al., 2005</a>) provide further evidence for synchrony mediated purely by hydrodynamic coupling. Motivated by Rothschild's observation, Taylor (<a href=\"#bib33\">Taylor, 1951</a>) developed a mathematical model in which two laterally infinite, inextensible sheets with prescribed sinusoidal travelling waves of transverse deformation interact with each other through a viscous fluid. He found that the rate of viscous dissipation is minimised when the two sheets are in phase. While minimisation of dissipation often holds in real physical systems, it is not in general a fundamental principle from which to deduce dynamical processes. Rather, an explanation for synchronization should capture the forces and torques associated with the underlying molecular motors that drive flagella, their elasticity, as well as the viscosity of the surrounding fluid."

These experiments can be viewed as natural generalisations of earlier work in which vibrating microneedles (<a href=\"#bib25\">Okuno and Hiramoto, 1976</a>) or micropipettes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Eshel and Gibbons, 1989</a>) are used to modulate and entrain the beating of a single sperm flagellum. Owing to the natural distribution of beating frequencies of the flagella of its surface somatic cells, the colonial alga <i>Volvox carteri</i> is ideally suited to this purpose. Each somatic cell possesses two flagella which beat in perfect synchrony, facilitating their treatment as a single entity, henceforth referred to as the <i>flagellum</i>. Somatic cells were isolated from adult <i>Volvox</i> colonies and held with micropipettes at a controllable separation <i>d</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The spatial and orientational degrees of freedom associated with this configuration enabled comprehensive analysis over a wide range of hydrodynamic coupling strengths. We found that closely-separated pairs of cells can exhibit robust phase-locking for thousands of beats at a time, despite a discrepancy in their intrinsic frequencies of as much as 10%. Both in-phase and antiphase configurations were observed, depending on the alignment of the directions of flagellar propulsion. Furthermore, with increasing interflagellar spacing we observed for each flagellum a marked change in the beating waveform, a key finding that lends support to models of synchronization that rely on waveform compliance to achieve phase-locking."

For sufficiently strong coupling, different cells can adopt a common phase-locked frequency through perturbing one another from their intrinsic limit cycles. Indeed, models of coupled flagella involving hydrodynamically coupled semiflexible filaments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gueron et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Guirao and Joanny, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Yang et al., 2008</a>) show a tendency towards metachronal coordination, though the precise role that flexibility plays in facilitating synchrony is unknown. Minimal models in which spheres are driven along flexible trajectories (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brumley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Niedermayer et al., 2008</a>) reveal that deformation-induced changes in the phase speed can facilitate synchrony. However, functional variations in the intrinsic flagellar driving forces could lead to synchrony even for fixed beating patterns (<a href=\"#bib34\">Uchida and Golestanian, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2012</a>)."

One example is shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> where the extracted waveform is shown at various stages through the beating cycle, overlaid onto logarithmically-scaled residence time plots. The same pair of flagella is compared at close and far cell\u2013cell separations (7.3 \u03bcm and 72.2 \u03bcm respectively). In order to characterise flagellar waveform changes as the cells are brought closer together, we define three angles <i>x</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>, <i>x</i><sub><i>b</i></sub>, <i>x</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> (radians) with respect to the cell body axis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> shows the temporal evolution of these angles for the right flagellum, corresponding to the close (red), intermediate (green) and wide (blue) separations. In particular, the most significant difference is observed in the <i>x</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> component (distal part of the flagellum). Similar results are found for the other cell, indicating that the interaction is mutual. <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a> illustrate the robustness of these results for multiple cells and different configurations.

Theoretical studies and experiments suggest that cell body rocking of freely swimming <i>Chlamydomonas</i> can induce synchrony (<a href=\"#bib8\">Friedrich and J\u00fclicher, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Geyer et al., 2013</a>), and experimental investigations of such cells hint that hydrodynamic interactions between the flagella and cell body could be important for locomotion (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kurtuldu et al., 2013</a>). At the same time, the synchronization properties of immobilised <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells are generally consistent with models in which the flagella interact purely hydrodynamically (<a href=\"#bib10\">Goldstein et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Polin et al., 2009</a>), although the observed antiphase synchronization of the <i>ptx1</i> mutant has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib18\">Leptos et al., 2013</a>) to implicate intracellular coupling such as through elastic filaments at the basal bodies. In addition, intracellular calcium fluctuations in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> are known to affect the flagellar dynamics (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yoshimura et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Leptos et al., 2013</a>), so these studies cannot exclude the possibility that flagellar synchrony is regulated primarily by chemical or other non-mechanical means. Indeed, Machemer showed that membrane voltage affects the metachronal wave direction in <i>Paramecium</i> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Machemer, 1972</a>)."

                        "text": "In the present experiment, cells are held with micropipettes in order to preclude all chemical coupling of the two flagella other than the possible advection of molecules by the flow. The fact that the coupling strength for IP and AP pairs is almost identical despite the pronounced difference between the associated flows rules out coupling via chemical means. In these experiments hydrodynamics alone is responsible for the interflagellar coupling. Yet, this may be direct interaction between the flagella or indirect, through some residual motion of the cell bodies. If such motion does play a role in the observed synchronization, it is useful to estimate the effective spring constant associated with angular displacements of the cell. This can be done by estimating the hydrodynamical torques at one cell due to the flagellar beating of a nearby cell and using an experimental bound on the observed angular displacement. The fluid speed <i>u</i> at a distance <i>r</i> from the origin due to a second cell whose flagellum exerts a (point) force of magnitude <i>F</i> varies as <i>u</i> \u223c <i>F</i>/8<i>\u03c0\u03bcr</i>, and when acting on the flagellum of the first cell will produce a torque scaling as <math id=\"inf51\"><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mo>\u22a5</mo></msub><mi>u</mi><msup><mi>l</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math>, where <i>l</i> is the length of the flagellum. If we set this equal to the torque <i>k\u03b1</i> of a rotational spring, where <i>k</i> is the spring constant and <i>\u03b1</i> the angular displacement, we obtain an estimate for <i>k</i> from an upper bound <i>\u03b1</i><sup>*</sup> for the rotation. Using <i>l</i> = 20 \u03bcm, <i>r</i> = 5 \u03bcm, and <i>F</i>/8<i>\u03c0\u03bc</i> \u223c 2 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s, we find <i>k</i> &gt; (3 \u00d7 10<sup>2</sup>/<i>\u03b1</i><sup>*</sup>) pN\u00b7\u03bcm. A similar argument can be constructed by considering the vorticity at the central cell due to the flow from another, and yields the same result. We have performed experiments of exactly this type, in which we measured the rocking motion of a deflagellated cell placed in the flow field of a cell with a beating flagellum (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), and found <i>\u03b1</i><sup>*</sup> \u2264 0.01 (about 0.5\u00b0). This strongly suggests <i>k</i> &gt; 3 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> pN\u00b7\u03bcm, which, by the calculations of <a href=\"#bib9\">Geyer et al. (2013)</a>, is sufficiently large to suggest that rocking does not play a significant role in the synchronization observed in the present experiments."

Physical separation of the cells precludes any form of chemical or direct mechanical coupling, leaving hydrodynamic interactions as the only mechanism through which synchronization can occur. The process of phase-locking is extremely robust, with cells sufficiently close to one another exhibiting uninterrupted synchrony for thousands of consecutive beats. Accompanying this synchrony is a characteristic shift in the flagellar waveform. The extracted interflagellar coupling strength is consistent with hydrodynamic predictions and the measured flow fields generated by individual flagella. Additional experiments were undertaken using a uniflagellar mutant of the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. Although its flagellum is shorter and its waveform is different to that of <i>Volvox</i>, we also observed hydrodynamic phase-locking in these experiments. Owing to the ubiquity and uniformity in the structure and function of flagella in various eukaryotic species, the results of the present study are expected to generalise to other systems, and may be of significant value for a wide range of theoretical models."

This geometry allowed us to investigate both in-phase and antiphase configurations for the same pair of cells, through the simple rotation of one pipette. At the same time, however, this meant that the two cells were held from different directions with respect to their flagella, and that one of the two pipettes was oriented along the direction of the flagellar power stroke, which is the main flow direction. This can cause two problems. Firstly, the flow field of a cell held by the side could be significantly different from that presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. Secondly, the holding pipettes could distort the scaling of the flagellar flow with cell\u2013cell separation from the \u223c1/<i>r</i> scaling presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>. We investigated these problems with the series of experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. One cell was held at its posterior pole by a pipette (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) and the flow field measured. A second micropipette was then moved progressively closer, eventually to the point of contact with the cell (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). It is clear that the second pipette affects the flow, but mostly in the region between the two pipettes."

A large contribution is represented simply by a \u223c7% decrease in flow speed. Taking this decrease into account, the average relative change is about 5%. As a result, these experiments allow us to consider the flow generated by a cell held from the side as identical to that generated by a cell held from the back, at least in the region of interest to our experiments. By comparing the flows for different positions of the second pipette, we can also quantify its effect on the flow field that would be experienced by the second cell. For each configuration of pipettes, this can be estimated as the relative difference between the unperturbed and the perturbed flows in the region where the flagella of the second cell would be, here considered to be a 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> region 20 \u03bcm to the left of the tip of the incoming pipette.

Secondly, this minimal system allows to link biology and physics in a quantitative way to generate mechanistic insight."

At the very least, several other examples need to be shown, perhaps as figure supplements, to show that the effect of distance on waveform isn't just some idiosyncrasy of this particular cell pair. What would be more ideal is if there is some way to parameterize the limit cycles so that their shape could be described by a single number or some small number of parameters. The cycles look teardrop shaped so maybe one could use a Pyriform (\u201cpear shaped quartic\u201d), or the Lemniscate of Bernoulli. Regardless of how it is accomplished, having some ability to compare results from different cells statistically is very important."

Otherwise, there is a concern that potential oscillations of the micropipettes caused by the flagellar oscillations could by relayed by such a coupling. One cilium is certainly too weak to generate such a strong vibration to excite the manipulator and then back to the other cilium. There is of course the potential that the stage itself is vibrating and then causes both of them to oscillate. Sperm cells have been held on vibrating micro needles, and vibrating micro needles were brought close to flagella (Eshel 1989 and Okuno 1976); from there the authors could potentially estimate how strongly the manipulator would have to vibrate."

Ideally, we would like to project out limit cycles on some basis set of curves, which could then be used to quantify the limit cycles\u2019 deformations. We believe that it is the extent of these deformations that should be compared between cells, rather than the limit cycles themselves. Unfortunately, we did not find any convincing way to put this idea into practice. In particular it was not obvious to us what would constitute a good metric in this space of curves. We decided, therefore, to present only the raw deformations. It is our hope that with time these results will inspire the development of a technique to quantify the deformations."

The two micropipettes were held on physically separated supports in either of two ways. In one, each micropipette is mounted on a separate multi-axis translation stage supported on a vibrationally-damped rod attached to the optical table but with having no physical contact with the microscope. In the second approach, one of those micropipettes is instead supported on a miniature translation stage mounted directly on the microscope body, while the other is still mounted on a separate manipulator. With all these pre-cautions we are very confident the observed flagellar dynamics is indeed intrinsic to the cells.
