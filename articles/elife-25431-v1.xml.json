The findings of Pal et al. suggest that proteins of the TGF-beta\u00a0signaling pathway are potential targets for new \u201canti-evolvability\u201d drugs that could be effective against many different types of cancer. Several drugs that target the TGF-beta pathway are already in clinical trials (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib3\">Herbertz et al., 2015</a>)."

Programmed mutagenesis and evolution drive our adaptive immune systems, but might also underlie other complex developmental programs that require more flexibility and responsiveness than our genomes encode (discussed\u00a0by <a href=\"#bib1\">Fitzgerald et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Pal et al., 2017</a>). TGF-beta signaling controls how wounds heal, certain aspects of embryo development, and how the nervous system forms. Future work may indicate that TGF-beta and other inducible mutagenesis responses allow multicellular complexity and flexibility in ways not yet appreciated."
