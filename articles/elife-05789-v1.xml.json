We use computational modelling to test different scenarios for how Four-jointed might act and test the model predictions by employing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching as an in vivo assay to measure the influence of Four-jointed on Fat-Dachsous binding. We demonstrate that in vivo, Four-jointed acts both on Fat to promote its binding to Dachsous and on Dachsous to inhibit its binding to Fat, with a bias towards a stronger effect on Fat. Overall, we show that opposing gradients of Fat and Dachsous phosphorylation are sufficient to explain the observed pattern of Fat\u2013Dachsous binding and planar polarisation across the wing, and thus demonstrate the mechanism by which a long-range gradient is interpreted."

We use computational modelling to test different scenarios for how Four-jointed might act and test the model predictions by employing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching as an in vivo assay to measure the influence of Four-jointed on Fat-Dachsous binding. We demonstrate that in vivo, Four-jointed acts both on Fat to promote its binding to Dachsous and on Dachsous to inhibit its binding to Fat, with a bias towards a stronger effect on Fat. Overall, we show that opposing gradients of Fat and Dachsous phosphorylation are sufficient to explain the observed pattern of Fat\u2013Dachsous binding and planar polarisation across the wing, and thus demonstrate the mechanism by which a long-range gradient is interpreted."

However, it also makes Fat more able to bind to Dachsous. These opposing effects are thought to cause the proteins to accumulate on opposing sides of each cell.

In the model, Fj is allowed to phosphorylate either Ft or Ds in proportion to its concentration, and Ft and Ds are then permitted to freely bind at cell edges until they reach equilibrium (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To produce a representative model, we measured the gradient of Fj expression across <i>Drosophila</i> larval wing discs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), using <i>fj</i> null clones to determine the appropriate background correction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2032\u2032</a>). A gradient of 2.5\u20133.5% between adjacent cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) was observed along the proximo-distal axis.

In the absence of any gradients (i.e., uniform Ft, Ds, and Fj expression across the tissue), Ft (blue) and Ds (purple) freely associate at junctions, with a certain proportion binding to form heterodimers (indicated by double black bars). We predict that by adding a Fj gradient (yellow bar) an asymmetric distribution of Ft\u2013Ds binding across a cell will occur. If Fj inhibits Ds binding and promotes Ft binding more strongly to the right, Ft molecules in each cell prefer to bind to Ds in the next left-most cell (with which they have a stronger binding interaction), and so preferentially accumulate at left cell edges; similarly Ds molecules prefer to associate with Ft in the next right-most cell and in turn accumulate at right cell edges. Hence, the overall consequence of a Fj gradient and free movement of Ft and Ds within cells is the generation of cellular asymmetries of Ft and Ds distributions.

Each bar represents one cell and the scale indicates the amount of bound Ds or Ft in arbitrary units at junctions between cells (note scale is cut off at 20 units), also see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Sloped top edges represent the difference between proximal and distal cell edges within one cell. A more graded slope within a cell indicates an increase in asymmetry. 23 cells are represented and the observed Fj gradient of 3% (<b>B</b>) has been used. Looking at both bound Ds (<b>D</b>) and bound Ft (<b>E</b>) shows Ds is preferentially localised distally and Ft proximally. If Fj acts on Ds only (<b>D</b> and <b>E</b>), weak asymmetry is seen within cells (3.8% increase) and a tissue gradient of higher to lower Ft\u2013Ds binding is seen as Fj increases. If Fj acts on Ft only (<b>D\u2032</b> and <b>E\u2032</b>) similar weak asymmetry (3.6% increase) is seen within cells, however, a tissue gradient of lower to higher Ft\u2013Ds binding is observed as Fj increases. If Fj can act on both Ft and Ds (<b>D\u2033</b> and <b>E\u2033</b>) stronger asymmetry is seen within cells (7.9% increase) and the tissue gradient is much reduced."

Multiplying the intensity of FRAP regions prior to bleaching (<b>C\u2032</b> and <b>D\u2032</b>) by the stable fraction plateau (<b>C</b> and <b>D</b>) reveals a final \u2018stable amount\u2019 of protein at junctions (<b>C\u2033</b> and <b>D\u2033</b>) and a large significant difference between puncta and non-puncta regions (both p = 0.0001, error bars denote standard error (SEM) here and in all remaining figures).

Initially, puncta and non-puncta regions are selected and their intensity measured (pre-bleach intensity). The regions are bleached for a few seconds by increasing the laser power. Bleached regions are imaged over time and recovery of the unstable population is measured for around 5 min. Measurements are plotted and a one-phase exponential curve is fitted to the data. The plateau of this curve gives us the unstable fraction and to get the stable fraction we minus the unstable fraction from 1, for example, 1\u20130.78 = 0.22. This figure is multiplied by the pre-bleach intensity to give the stable amount. So if, for example, 78% unbleached protein has recovered, 22% of the bleached protein in the region of interest is then the stable fraction. We multiply this by the original pre-bleach intensity. So, a starting intensity of 500 units is multiplied by 0.22 to get a final stable amount of 110 units. However, if a mutant has a starting intensity of 250 and the same stable fraction of 22% we would say the stable amount of the mutant is 55. The mutant has therefore much less stable protein at junctions despite having a similar stable fraction. An example of puncta and non-puncta regions in <i>ds-EGFP</i> is also shown<i>.</i>"

During FRAP, flies with an EGFP-tagged protein (e.g., Ds-EGFP) are used, and a fluorescent region of interest is selected and bleached. The same region is imaged over time and recovery of fluorescent protein is measured. Recovery is due to movement of unbleached protein into the bleached area from elsewhere in the cell and any protein that has been bleached remains bleached and is not reactivated. Therefore, if after bleaching and imaging, over time we see, for example, fluorescence recovering to 30% of the starting intensity we assume that 70% of the bleached protein remains and is therefore stably bound at the junction. We perform all of our experiments using the same microscope settings (unless otherwise stated) and since protein levels (and thus fluorescent intensity) can vary between genotypes, we must take this into account during our analysis. To do this, we multiply the starting intensity by the stable fraction to get a final stable amount (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We make the assumption that a decrease in the speed or size of the mobile population provides a readout of increased binding interactions. For instance, if the size of the mobile population (unstable fraction) increases in a particular genotype and, once the intensity is taken into account, a smaller stable amount of overall protein is calculated, we assume that binding affinity has decreased. Additionally, if the speed of protein recovery after bleaching increases in a particular mutant, we infer that binding is not as strong as \u2018wild-type\u2019 and the protein can therefore relocate more quickly. FRAP was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib34\">Strutt et al., 2011</a> see also \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>: individual data points and confidence intervals are also provided in the relevant figure supplements and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) in the same proximal region of the wing disc (unless otherwise stated) using a strain of flies expressing the Ds protein endogenously tagged with EGFP (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>), and a newly generated strain in which EGFP was inserted at the C-terminus of the endogenous Ft coding region (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Both transgenes were found to be expressed and localised similarly to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) and insertion of the tag did not affect wing size or shape suggesting protein function is normal."

The Ft-EGFP signal was almost twice the level of Ds-EGFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>), therefore laser power had to be adjusted accordingly between experiments meaning the final stable amounts for Ds-EGFP cannot be compared directly to those for Ft-EGFP. For both puncta and non-puncta, there was some recovery of fluorescence demonstrating that the proteins were mobile at junctions. Recovery was not complete indicating that there was also a population of stable Ds-EGFP and Ft-EGFP that did not recover during the time period used. Measuring protein recovery revealed a significant difference in stability between puncta and non-puncta regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) with puncta showing an increased amount of stable protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2033,D\u2033</a>, both p = 0.0001) when taking pre-bleach intensity levels into account (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2032,D\u2032</a>).

The internalisation assay is performed in pre-pupal wings as the peripodial membrane prevents the assay from being effective in the wing disc. Live pre-pupal wings were dissected in Schneider's medium and incubated with antibody against V5 at 0\u00b0C followed by washing and chasing at room temperature before fixation. The amount of V5-Ft at the cell surface was determined via incubation with secondary antibody in the absence of detergent. When endocytosis was allowed by moving the tissue to room temperature the total amount of apical cell surface protein decreased over time suggesting protein internalisation was occurring and indicating the presence of an unstable cell surface population of V5-Ft (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). To confirm that protein loss was not due to antibody drop off, V5-Ft previously found at the surface was traced to internal vesicles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) and found to co-localise with the early endosome marker Hrs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2032</a>). Populations of V5-Ft appeared to be resistant to endocytic turnover with persistent puncta of cell surface V5-Ft observed after 20 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This was consistent with the puncta stability observed in FRAP experiments both in wing discs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2033</a>) and also in the pre-pupal wing (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Note however, that although we assume that these remaining populations in each assay are the same, we cannot be certain that this is the case. During FRAP, we are unable to observe the fate of the bleached protein. Furthermore, in the internalisation assay, protein might be internalised and return to the same sites via exocytosis."

This suggests that in addition to the immobile population of Ds bound to Ft which is concentrated in puncta as described in the previous section, there is also a mobile population of Ds-EGFP present in both puncta and non-puncta regions which is bound to Ft and shows less rapid movement than free Ds-EGFP (i.e., Ds-EGFP in the absence of Ft). The reduction in the rate of movement of these mobile Ds-Ft heterodimers in puncta as opposed to non-puncta might indicate the presence of a cis-dimerisation mechanism that promotes the clustering of heterodimers into the puncta. Alternatively, mechanisms such as physical interactions with the cytoskeleton similar to those seen for E-Cadherin clustering (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cavey et al., 2008</a>) may be responsible for the reduced mobility."

We surmise that these differences are due to there being an excess of Ft-EGFP present over Ds (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>), resulting in an increased proportion of the population of Ft-EGFP being unbound and thereby free to move into bleached regions."

As Ft\u2013Ds binding across junctions is mutually dependent, we infer that if one protein gains or loses stability, so will the other. Moreover, as Fj is thought to act on Ft and Ds in opposite ways, if we remove Fj, we might not expect to see any difference in overall stability of Ft\u2013Ds dimers as the positive and negative effects could cancel each other out.

However, our data have shown that, although Fj can act on both Ft and Ds, the phosphorylation of Ft to increase Ft\u2013Ds binding is dominant. Furthermore, in the absence of Ft phosphorylation (in a Ft phosphomutant), the phosphorylation of Ds (\u2018wildtype\u2019 vs <i>fj</i><sup><i>-</i></sup>) has no significant effect on the overall amount of bound protein. In order to understand how this might affect the establishment of cellular asymmetry and binding across a tissue, we modified our model parameters as follows: first, we reduced the degree by which phosphorylated Ds inhibits Ft\u2013Ds binding in complexes where Ft is phosphorylated (i.e., complexes A and B); second, we made the binding affinities for complexes formed from unphosphorylated Ft (i.e., complexes C and D) the same (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We then ran the model with Fj acting on both Ds and Ft (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We consequently still see the establishment of cellular asymmetries in Ft\u2013Ds distribution within each cell, but also see a tissue gradient of Ft\u2013Ds binding that follows the Fj gradient. The model therefore predicts that as you move from a region of low Fj to high Fj, Ft\u2013Ds dimer stability and thus the stable amount at cell junctions should increase."

When Fj can act on both Ft and Ds with a Ft bias, an intermediate outcome between acting on Ft only and acting on Ft and Ds without a bias is seen and a cellular asymmetry of 4.1% is observed. A tissue gradient of 4.7% in the model when acting on both Ft and Ds, compared to 10% when Fj acts on Ft alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2032,E\u2032</a>) suggests that Ds phosphorylation is required to counter the strong graded effects of Ft phosphorylation. (<b>B</b>) FRAP analysis of endogenously expressed Ds-EGFP reveals a larger stable fraction in regions of high Fj (distal) despite showing slightly less overall fluorescence (<b>B\u2032</b>). Overall, a significantly increased stable amount is seen in high Fj regions (<b>B\u2033</b> p = 0.01, 23% difference).

To test this, we used FRAP analysis on endogenously expressed Ds-EGFP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and were able to detect a statistically significant increase in stable junctional amount in more distal regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2033</a>, 292.9 \u00b1 19 proximally and 378 \u00b1 18 distally, p = 0.01, 23% difference [see also <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>]).

More specifically, with regard to understanding how cell polarity is coordinated across sheets of cells, a major goal is to determine the mechanism by which a gradient of transcription across a tissue (produced for instance in response to a morphogen) can be sensed by individual cells to result in each cell adopting a uniform polarisation. A particular challenge for such a sensing mechanism is that the difference in levels of transcription between adjacent cells may be very small (e.g., only a few percent or less of the peak expression levels), and at the high end of the gradient this difference needs to be read against the background of a high overall expression level."

In this study, we focus specifically on the mechanisms determining Ft\u2013Ds subcellular polarity in the <i>Drosophila</i> third instar wing imaginal disc. At this stage, Fj is expressed in a gradient, high at the putative distal end of the wing (i.e., the centre of the wing pouch) and low proximally towards the wing hinge (<a href=\"#bib32\">Strutt et al., 2004</a>), whereas Ds is relatively uniformly expressed in the visible region of the wing pouch, but higher in hinge regions of the wing (<a href=\"#bib33\">Strutt and Strutt, 2002</a>). It is important to point out that much of the proximal wing blade is folded at the larval stage and most likely also has high levels of Ds expression and this region of high Ds expression could therefore also be promoting Ft\u2013Ds asymmetry. Although we believe that both the Fj and Ds expression patterns are important cues for specifying Ft\u2013Ds asymmetry in the wing pouch, the evidence suggests that boundaries of Ds expression may only be able to act as a patterning cue over a few cell diameters (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>), and therefore throughout much of the wing pouch the Fj gradient is likely to be a dominant cue."

Weak binding (no line) between heterodimers can occur between all populations, intermediate binding (double lines) can occur when Ft-P is available and the strongest bond (solid line) occurs only between Ft-P and Ds. As there is a bias towards Ft phosphorylation increasing binding, more intermediate binding occurs in regions of high Fj even though less favourable Ds (light purple) is available. In regions of low Fj, although there is more favourable Ds available, Ft-P is less abundant meaning fewer intermediate bonds are able to form. As Ft-P allows for stronger binding in cells with higher Fj, Ds in the next left-most cell preferentially accumulates to the right cell edge meaning the Fj gradient produces cellular asymmetry. A gradient of tissue binding is also produced with cells in the left-most cell producing fewer intermediate bonds than those in the right-most cell.

Using this we show that a Fj gradient can lead to cellular asymmetry of Ft\u2013Ds if Fj acts on either Ft or Ds or both. Our predictions differ from those of a previous study (<a href=\"#bib28\">Simon et al., 2010</a>) which suggested that Fj acting only on Ft would not result in a cellular asymmetry of activity: the origin of this difference is that in our model (in accordance with our experimental observations) the Ft and Ds populations are mobile and able to redistribute to the most favourable cell edge. However, in agreement with the same study, our model does predict that only in the situation that Fj acts on both Ft and Ds is the amount of Ft\u2013Ds dimers bound at the junctions approximately the same across the entire axis of the Fj gradient."

This prediction was confirmed experimentally. We cannot rule out that under normal circumstances the in vivo effects of Fj on Ds are in fact negligible compared to those on Ft, as our experiments make use of Ds transgenes and may not fully represent events occurring when wild-type Ds is expressed from its endogenous locus. Nevertheless, the simplest interpretation of both our observations and previous published work is that Ds phosphorylation contributes to normal patterning.

This might suggest that in addition to trans-interactions between Ft and Ds in neighbouring cells, there may also be cis-interactions between Ft and Ds molecules in cell junctions, a view supported by previous experimental reports (<a href=\"#bib23\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Sopko et al., 2009</a>).

A possible working hypothesis is that phosphorylation events lead to changes in the intramolecular conformation of the extracellular regions of Ft and Ds, by analogy to the way in which phosphorylation frequently acts to cause other classes of molecules to enter \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018closed\u2019 conformations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Xu and Carpenter, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Potter et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bertocchi et al., 2012</a>). A possible scenario is that phosphorylation of each molecule causes it to enter an \u2018open\u2019 conformation, and that \u2018open\u2019 Ft binds most favourably to Ds, but \u2018closed\u2019 Ds binds most favourably to Ft (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). A recent publication analysing the configuration of mammalian Ft4 and Ds1 revealed multiple hairpin-like bends in their C-terminal regions caused by the loss of calcium binding linkers (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tsukasaki et al., 2014</a>). It is possible that Fj phosphorylation results in conformational changes between cadherin repeat domains near to these calcium binding sites resulting in the regulation of binding strength, as suggested previously for E-cadherin (<a href=\"#bib24\">Petrova et al., 2012</a>). Further studies of the structures and mode of heterophilic interactions between Ft and Ds will be required to resolve this question."

For pre- and post-bleach images, a 448 Argon laser was used at an output of 0.5% with varying gain settings depending upon phenotype. Eight 1 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> regions of interest (ROIs) were selected per wing and bleached using the 488 argon laser at 50% power, passing 1\u20133 times for between 0.5 and 1.5 s depending upon experiment. Two pre-bleach images were captured with no delay as well as an immediate post-bleach image, 10 images were then captured every 5 s, followed by 10 images every 10 s and 10 images every 30 s. The initial rapid imaging was done in order to capture adequate rate information. For analysis, ROIs were individually reselected in ImageJ at each time point and acquisition bleaching was measured in non-bleached regions. Data were corrected for acquisition bleaching and normalised against pre-bleach values. An XY graph was plotted for each wing in PRISM (v.6 GraphPad). A one-phase exponential association curve was fitted for each ROI and an average plateau value recorded. A one-phase exponential curve was generated as we observe a single mode of recovery that reaches a plateau. We note that should the mode of recovery be more complex than this a two-phase exponential curve may be more appropriate; however, we do not have relevant experimental data to support this. Pre-bleach values were averaged per wing and multiplied by their associated plateau giving a stable amount. Stable amounts were then averaged across wings producing a final figure for each genotype. Stable amounts were analysed using unpaired t-tests or ordinary one-way ANOVAs with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons. Final stable fraction graphs were produced using the average plot for each wing and intensity was averaged across ROIs."

Relative binding strengths of different molecule combinations reflect findings from in vivo and in vitro studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brittle et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Simon et al., 2010</a>), such that phosphorylation of Ft (FtP) promotes its binding and conversely phosphorylation of Ds (DsP) inhibits its binding. The following hierarchy of relevant association constants was used initially, A &gt; B = C &gt; D, such that the complex containing the two favoured molecules, FtP and Ds making complex A, had a faster \u2018on\u2019 rate than other combinations. Initial values of <i>k</i><sub><i>on</i></sub><i>/k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub> for A, B, C, and D were chosen as 1, 1/4, 1/4 and 1/16, respectively, to reflect the relative differences in stable amounts measured experimentally."

Thus association constants for each complex A, B, C, and D, were given as 1, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/4, respectively. Further explanation can be found in the \u2018Results\u2019."

It addresses in a new and concrete way a long-standing question that asks how a shallow multicellular gradient can be converted into a consistently oriented and asymmetric distribution of molecules within single cells. This question has often been explored by modelling but the models are not usually checked out by observation. However this paper is based on the Ft/Ds system for planar cell polarity and combines molecular measurements with modelling. The amount of bound Ds and Ft is estimated by an apparently ingenious use of FRAP. The paper has interesting findings: for the first time the authors have weighed the relative contributions of the Ds, Ft and Fj distributions to the final pattern and tried to quantify how and why the effects of Fj on Ds and Ft differ in strength. They have found evidence for a central tenet of the Ds/Ft model, as proposed earlier, that there should be a gradient of Ds/Ft heterodimers across the tissue. They have estimated the steepness of the Fj gradient from measurements based on Fj antibody. In our opinion the paper clearly deserves publication in <i>eLife</i> but only after revision, the main purpose of which would be to make its scientific strategy and results clearer for the reader."

If in the non-puncta there is an intensity of 200 and a recovery also of 0.8 the result would be 160; and course the difference between 160 and 800 is great but those two figures are not the figures one should be comparing as the recovery is 0.8 in both cases."

The authors are attempting to understand the problem quantitatively by developing a 1D computational model.

I feel the authors have not been able to address this issue fully, and merely show a mild cellular asymmetry as a result of their new proposed model, which is only slightly better than their first model, where they did not have the new in vivo parameters. Admittedly, the authors do acknowledge this problem, and discuss several possible mechanisms for generating a higher cellular asymmetry, such as feedback and amplification mechanisms. Unless the authors can attempt to include these mechanisms and show that they can be significant factors in generating the high cellular asymmetries, the mystery, in my opinion, still exists.

These include the finding that the Fj effect on Ft seems to predominate in vivo over its effects on Ds, and that this creates a slight gradient of Ft-Ds binding strength across the wing that depends on distal Fj. The authors also find that a phosphomimetic version of Ds does not show the expected decrease in stable binding.

However, it seems likely that other types of interactions would be required to cause immobilization per se. The authors suggest that cis-interactions may be important (eighth paragraph of the Discussion section). Other types of events, such as interactions of proteins with the actin cytoskeleton might be important as an immobilization mechanism and/or the establishment of \u201cstable\u201d populations. It appears that such a mechanism was previously suggested to be important for the case of E-cadherin in puncta (Cavey et al., Nature, 2008, 453:751-6, A two-tiered mechanism for stabilization and immobilization of E-cadherin).

A complex that contains both favoured molecules (complex A with FtP and Ds) will bind better than one which contains both least favoured molecules (complex D with Ft and DsP). The remaining combinations of molecules making up complexes B and C will bind somewhere in the middle. We have given B and C association constants and began by making them equal to one another since we had no evidence to suggest one was better at binding than the other. The values broadly reflect the differences in stable amount we have measured in our experiments. For example, complex A and C both contain unphosphorylated Ds, but differ in the phosphorylation of Ft. We have set association constants as 1 and \u00bc for A and C respectively, which is similar to the differences in stable amount seen in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> comparing Ds phosphomutant in the presence (complex A) or absence (complex C) of Fj."

Other papers also include Mani et al., PNAS, 2012 and Abley et al., Development, 2013, all three of which only consider one possible complex forming, essentially equivalent in our model to complex A (FtP\u2013Ds). This means that in each study the authors needed to implement feedback mechanisms to avoid non-uniform levels of bound material across the tissue. We have added citations to all three publications and a description of this key difference (see Materials and methods). Reviewer 2 noticed subtle differences in the modelled cellular asymmetries across the tissue presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>. Upon further examination we found that this was an artifact of the presentation of the model implementation, and we have thus replaced the figure, which we hope appears clearer. Regardless, there is no significant difference in asymmetries across the tissue in any of our modeling figures, furthermore, we now indicate the average cellular asymmetry for each graph in the figure legends. There was some confusion over whether this was an ODE or PDE model. Since we have stated that we included a diffusion term in our equations, one might presume that we are considering how molecule concentrations vary over space as well as time, thus requiring PDEs. We have now renamed this a redistribution term, since we have simply redistributed unbound molecules across the two membranes of each cell within our ODE model."
