Yet, little is known regarding the physiological consequences of morphological variability. We quantify animal-to-animal variability in cable lengths (CV = 0.4) and branching patterns in the Gastric Mill (GM) neuron, an identified neuron type with highly-conserved physiological properties in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of <i>Cancer borealis.</i> We examined passive GM electrotonic structure by measuring the amplitudes and apparent reversal potentials (E<sub>rev</sub>s) of inhibitory responses evoked with focal glutamate photo-uncaging in the presence of TTX. Apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were relatively invariant across sites (mean CV \u00b1 SD = 0.04 \u00b1 0.01; 7\u201320 sites in each of 10 neurons), which ranged between 100\u2013800 \u00b5m from the somatic recording site. Thus, GM neurons are remarkably electrotonically compact (estimated \u03bb &gt; 1.5 mm). Electrotonically compact structures, in consort with graded transmission, provide an elegant solution to observed morphological variability in the STG."

To probe the distributed cable properties of GM neurons, we employed a custom-built microscope to focally photo-uncage MNI-glutamate (Tocris) with ultraviolet light at many sites across the GM neuronal structure (in TTX to attenuate spiking activity and overall circuit activity). In each GM neuron (N\u00a0=\u00a010), we used two-electrode current clamp at the soma to measure voltage responses arising from glutamate receptor activation at the soma, primary neurite, and more distal sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; 7\u201320 photo-uncaging sites per neuron with 1 ms, 30 mW UV pulses and a bath concentration of 250 \u00b5M MNI-glutamate). Experiments probing the spatial resolution of our photo-uncaging system demonstrated that the effective photo-uncaging radius was approximately 15 \u00b5m, a resolution high enough to target individual neurites (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>)."

To quantify the dependence of response amplitude on each neuron\u2019s cable properties, we generated \u2018lolliplots\u2019 of response amplitude, measured at the soma, to each photo-stimulated site, as a function of their distance from the somatic recording site, branch order, and neurite size (measured in terms of neurite diameter in the x-y plane; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The lolliplots show that the greatest response amplitudes can occur from photo-stimulation at sites with any distance from the soma, of any branch order, and of any size. Linear regression analyses of response amplitudes as a function of each of these geometric parameters showed no significant linear relationships, with insignificant p-values&gt;0.1 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

This approach distinguishes the degree to which the passive cable properties cause electrotonic decrement of voltage signals in their path of propagation to the somatic recording site, independent of the maximal conductance or receptor density at the photo-stimulation site. To demonstrate this logic, we built a library of passive cable models in the NEURON simulation platform (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</a>; see Materials and methods) and simulated activation of local inhibitory chloride currents (actual E<sub>rev</sub> = \u221270 mV) at varying distances from the recording site. Apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were measured by manipulating the membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) with current injections between \u22128 and\u00a0+2 nA at the recording site. First, we demonstrate that the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> of an inhibitory event evoked 200 \u00b5m away from the recording site (as shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) is independent of its maximal conductance (or receptor density; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>). The apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were measured with four maximal conductance (g<sub>max</sub>) values: 1, 5, 10, and 50 nS. Although the response amplitudes measured at the recording site vary with g<sub>max</sub>, all voltage responses flip their sign at \u221277 mV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This is shown graphically in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Ci</a>, where response amplitude (deltaV) is plotted as a function of V<sub>m</sub> (as measured at the recording site at 0 \u00b5m). For each g<sub>max</sub> value, the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> was calculated as the x-intercept of the linear regression of the deltaV versus V<sub>m</sub> curve (R\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.9 and p&lt;0.01 in each case). The inset in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Ci</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Cii</a> clearly show that the x-intercepts are the same for all four g<sub>max</sub> values. The apparent E<sub>rev</sub> is independent of g<sub>max</sub> magnitude, regardless of the activation site\u2019s distance from the recording site (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

It is evident from the traces in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> that the apparent E<sub>rev</sub>, or membrane potential at which the responses change sign, occurs at increasingly hyperpolarized membrane potentials as a function of increasing distance from the recording site. This hyperpolarizing shift in apparent E<sub>rev</sub> is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Fi</a>, where the x-intercepts for the deltaV versus membrane potential curves (as measured at the recording site at 0 \u00b5m) shift leftward with increasing activation site distance (shown clearly in the inset, a magnification of the x-intercepts). The apparent E<sub>rev</sub> shifts from an accurate measure of the actual E<sub>rev</sub> of \u221270 mV when activated at the recording site (0 \u00b5m) to \u2212110 mV when activated 1000 \u00b5m away (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Fii</a>).

Thus, each cable model is distinguished by its electrotonic length constant (\u03bb), determined by the expression: <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>r</mi><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>m</mi></msub></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>a</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></msqrt></mrow></math> where <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><msub><mi>g</mi><mrow><mi>p</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>. \u03bb, in \u00b5m or mm, is equivalent to the distance at which a propagating voltage signal decrements to 37% of the maximal voltage signal (as would be measured at the site of activation). <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> shows inhibitory voltage events evoked at increasing distances from the recording site (at 0 \u00b5m) in three cable models with different \u03bb values (200, 460, and 800 \u00b5m). With distance, the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> undergoes a hyperpolarizing shift (as was the case <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). However, the rate at which this apparent E<sub>rev</sub> hyperpolarizes, as a function of distance, is dependent on the electrotonic length constant of the cable (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). When \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0800 \u00b5m, all apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s are \u221270 mV, regardless of activation site distance. When \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0460 \u00b5m, apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s shift from \u221270 mV at the recording site (0 \u00b5m) to \u221288 mV at 1000 \u00b5m. When \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0200 \u00b5m, the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> shifts from \u221270 mV at 0 \u00b5m to well below \u2212100 mV when the activation site is 1000 \u00b5m away. It is evident that the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> undergoes a greater hyperpolarizing shift with distance with decreasing \u03bb values. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> shows the dependence of apparent E<sub>rev</sub> as a function of activation site location for all 20 cable models with \u03bb values ranging between 200\u20135000 \u00b5m. Considering a subset of these cable models, with \u03bb values between 300\u20131700 \u00b5m, the apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s measured at different activation site distances diverge as \u03bb decreases to 300 \u00b5m and converge as \u03bb increases beyond 1000 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>)."

The difference between the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> and the actual E<sub>rev</sub> is indicative of the ease of current flow in this direction and ability to manipulate the membrane potential at this distal site. Thus, there will always be a discrepancy between the voltage at the soma and the voltage at the photo-uncaging site and this discrepancy will depend on the effective electrotonic length constant of the neurite path. Therefore, this assay tests the passive cable properties of the path of propagation as is most relevant to current flow from recording site to stimulation site. Even so, the observations of sizeable voltage events at the recording site and reasonable reversal potentials are suggestive of a level of electrotonic compactness that is relevant to voltage signal propagation in either direction."

In these experiments, current was injected at the somatic recording site and flowed centrifugally from the recording site to the photo-uncaging site, changing the membrane potential at this distal site. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> illustrates the apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s of local inhibitory responses evoked at 7\u201315 sites, varying in their cable properties, across the same GM neuronal structure described in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> (a second example is shown in the <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For each photo-uncaging site, response amplitudes measured at the soma were plotted as a function of somatic membrane potential (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). These data were fit with linear regression analyses (R\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.9 in all cases) and the reversal potentials were determined by calculating the x-intercepts of the linear fits. The linear fits for each position show little variation in the reversal potential across all positions within each preparation, with a within-neuron coefficient of variation of 0.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 (mean \u00b1 SD; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Although apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were nearly invariant within each neuron, mean reversal potentials across neurons did vary, with a pooled mean of \u201378.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 mV (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This could be attributed to real differences in the ionic current, which could be carried by potassium, chloride, or a combination of the two ions (<a href=\"#bib62\">Marder and Paupardin-Tritsch, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Eisen and Marder, 1982</a>). A consequence of variable response amplitudes across positions yielded variable linear fit slopes within neurons (as shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This is likely a reflection of variable receptor densities or maximal conductances at the different photo-uncaging sites (consistent with the simulations shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). There was no significant linear relationship between input resistances measured at the soma (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) and the mean within-neuron reversal potentials (p=0.2; data not shown graphically, but available in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

This result differs from studies in a variety of neuron types that attribute specific physiological computations and plasticity rules to compartmentalized electrotonic structures. Early work in insect identified neurons with stereotyped dendritic branching patterns showed that electrotonically distinct dendritic subtrees result in the weighted integration of sensory inputs (<a href=\"#bib71\">Murphey et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bacon and Murphey, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Miller and Jacobs, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Jacobs and Miller, 1985</a>). Studies in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib96\">Spruston and Johnston, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carnevale et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999</a>), have attributed Hebbian plasticity in part to the passive normalization of postsynaptic potentials arising from the electrotonically distant apical and basal dendritic tufts. Work in medium spiny neurons (<a href=\"#bib54\">MacAskill et al., 2012</a>) and thalamocortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Connelly et al., 2016</a>) have demonstrated that the activation pattern of spatially-distributed, electrotonically distant, synaptic inputs produces different neuronal and circuit-level computations. The present work differs from these other studies of neuronal electrotonus and enriches our framework for understanding how morphology maps (or does not map) to physiological function. Otherwise stated: structural complexity does not necessarily yield compartmentalized computations."

Yet, current can be injected at the somatic recording site and effectively alter the membrane potential at such distal and distant sites allowing for reasonable apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s (approximately \u221280 mV). Likewise, the amplitude of the voltage response at the photo-uncaging site must be larger than what we observe at the soma. Because distally evoked events, initiated as far as 1 mm away, can be observed at the somatic recording site, the electrotonic decrement of these distal events must be small enough so that apparent reversal potentials can be recorded. Lastly, the invariance in apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s across sites (a measure independent of receptor density) suggests relatively little variance in the electrotonic decrement of signals coming from disparate sites across the neurite tree. In this sense, these neurons function almost like a single compartment, despite their complex structures."

Recent work has quantified the fine anatomical properties of GM neurons and other STG neuron types, showing that the primary neurite can be as large as 15\u201320 \u00b5m in diameter and that the most distal neurite branches may taper to diameters between\u00a0<span class=\"underline\">&lt;</span>1 and 10 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#bib75\">Otopalik et al., 2017</a>). GM neurites may have relatively low axial resistances as a consequence of large neurite diameters. It is possible that voltage signal decrement may also be minimized by high membrane resistances across neurite branches. Given that these neurons are electrotonically compact, the input resistance as measured at the soma is likely a reflection of the resistance of the membrane surface area of much of the entire neuron. Thus, it is not surprising that input resistances measured at the soma are relatively low (mean of approximately 10 M\u2126 (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), consistent with many years of recordings from STG neurons). If the neuron were less electrotonically compact, the input resistance measured at the soma would be higher, as the measurement would be restricted to the surface area of the local, somatic membrane."

These experiments were done in TTX, wherein TTX-sensitive, voltage-gated sodium channels are blocked and circuit activity is silenced. While the overall membrane conductance may be higher in the absence of TTX (although, no change in input resistance as measured at the soma was detected before and after TTX addition), we would not expect these TTX-sensitive currents to substantially alter inhibitory voltage signal propagation at the range of membrane potentials probed here (\u2212120 to \u221240 mV). Furthermore, spike initiation zones, where TTX-sensitive channels are most likely to reside, are located in the periphery, where the axons exit the neuropil (<a href=\"#bib83\">Raper, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Miller, 1980</a>). Thus, it is unlikely that TTX-sensitive voltage-gated channels would shunt the current arising from these evoked events in the same way as has been seen in other systems (<a href=\"#bib52\">Laurent, 1990</a>). In STG neurons, it is an intriguing possibility that separation of synaptic integration and slow waves from spike initiation zones may be a morphological strategy established to avoid shunting of synaptic currents. Future experiments in varying pharmacological and modulatory conditions could shed light on how different voltage-gated currents, modulatory currents, and ongoing synaptic input during rhythmic activity, may effectively compartmentalize these otherwise compact passive neuronal structures."

A 470 nm blue LED (10) is collimated by a plano-convex lens (11) and passes through a 466/40 nm band-pass filter (12) and field diaphragm (13). This light is re-directed by a 495 nm dichroic beamsplitter (14) and passes through a tube lens (15) and 405 nm low-pass dichroic beamsplitter (16). This is directed through the same 40x objective (7) and excites the alexa488 dye-filled preparation. This fluorescence passes through the 405 nm low-pass dichroic beamsplitter (16), tube lens (15), and 495 nm dichroic beamsplitter (14) and is subsequently captured by the CCD array of a firewire monochrome camera (Scientifica)."

Once fine neurites of the cell could be visualized with a fluorescent stereomicroscope (Leica MF165 F), a preliminary image was acquired at 11.5x magnification with an attached monochrome digital camera (Leica DFC365 FC). LY-filled preparations were fixed for 40 min at 21\u00b0C or overnight at 4\u00b0C in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 440 mM NaCl, 11 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4). Preparations were washed with 0.1\u00a0M PBS-T ((0.1\u20130.3%% Triton X-100 in PBS) and stored in PBS for 0\u20133 days prior to immunohistochemistry. The LY signal was amplified by 16 hr incubation with a polyclonal rabbit anti-LY antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes). After washing 5 \u00d7 15 min in PBS-T at room temperature, preparations were incubated in a secondary Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes) for 1.5 hr at room temperature. Preparations were washed 5 \u00d7 15 min in PBS at room temperature before mounting on pre-cleaned slides (25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a075 \u00d7 1 mm, superfrost, VWR) in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), with 9 mm diameter, 0.12 mm depth silicone seal spacers (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) under #1.5 coverslips (Fisher Scientific). Mounting in Vectashield with a spacer was sufficient to maintain the 3-dimensional structure of the neuron and ganglion (as in <a href=\"#bib25\">Goeritz et al., 2013</a>)."

For each skeleton, branch points, lengths, and orders were measured in reference to the soma and used to generate dendrogram representations with normalized path lengths. Branch, or path, lengths were measured as the most direct neurite path from the soma to each branch tip. Tortuosities were calculated for each path length, as the ratio of the path length over the Euclidean distance from soma to branch tip. Axon locations were identified as the last branch points without terminating branch tips. Photo-uncaging positions were re-located on preliminary fluorescence images of the Lucifer yellow dye-fill (as situated during experiment, at 11.5x magnification) using a custom alignment script written in MATLAB (Mathworks, version 2015b) by AO, and then manually re-located in the 3D skeleton using KNOSSOS (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>-Uncaging Coordinates Hoc files).

Briefly, this pipeline of analysis scripts was used to detect and browse evoked glutamate responses, measure voltage response amplitudes and membrane potentials, plot raw recordings and processed data, and perform some statistical analyses. To determine reversal potentials at a given photo-uncaging position, raw response amplitudes were plotted as a function of membrane potential. These data were fit with a linear function (with an R value\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.9 in all cases). In some cases, response amplitudes saturated and the linear regression analyses were performed only in the linear range of these data. The x-intercept of the resulting linear function indicated the reversal potential at that position.

The authors combine somatic 2-electrode voltage-clamp recordings with focal glutamate uncaging experiments to show that the amplitudes of glutamate responses appear not to depend strongly on distance or variations in local dendritic geometry. These are interesting, experiments, and the questions addressed are of broad general interest. However, the paper suffers from the fact that the authors are constrained to infer dendritic properties from somatic recordings without any direct measurements, and there are assumptions about the nature of the glutamate uncaging that are not adequately justified. Also, the computer models do not explore the very dendritic complexity that the study purports to address. In the end, I don't think readers will be convinced that the current data set provides sufficient mechanistic insight into the nature of dendritic integration in GM neurons.

However, for this approach to be valid, the density of (presumably mostly extra-synaptic) glutamate receptors must be uniform across the dendritic arbor. While the uncaged responses appear quite reliable in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> at a given location, responses at adjacent locations in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> are highly variable, possibly reflecting variations in receptor density along the dendrites. There seems to be no systematic changes in response amplitude with local dendrite diameter or branch order, but it is not known what the amplitude of the responses are at the site of uncaging. With so many unknown free parameters (receptor density, surface area, local input resistance) it is not clear how these data can be interpreted cleanly. It is also not clear how these responses relate to the function of actual synapses, which according to the authors are located on the finer distal branches."

This rather low value for input resistance (though perhaps not for invertebrate neurons) seems at odds with the authors' conclusion that GM neurons are electrically tight.

The manner in which reversal potentials are measured produces conditions that reduce the influence of dendritic filtering (since voltages during long command stimuli have reached a steady state). Also, voltages show less attenuation in the centrifugal vs. centripetal direction due to decreasing diameter and surface area of more distal dendritic branches. Williams and Mitchell (2008) elegantly explored these and other issues of dendritic filtering in neocortical pyramidal neurons\u2026and yet these neurons show compartmentalized responses and significant attenuation of synaptic events propagating from the dendrites to the soma. The ability of a voltage clamp circuit to measure reversal potentials of distal synapses with reasonable accuracy does not necessarily mean that local and propagated synaptic responses do not depend on dendritic morphology."

In neocortical pyramidal neurons, though, distance dependent compensation for much of the dendritic voltage attenuation of synaptic events arises from the passive electrotonic structure of the dendritic arbor (e.g. Williams and Stuart 2002). It seems to me that either or both of these mechanisms could potentially explain the current findings. Given that neither of these mechanisms is explored directly in the current study, I don't know that the authors are in a strong position to argue that GM neurons operate differently."

The GM neurons have varied morphology and dendritic branching patterns, yet all respond similarly during the motor pattern they participate in. The authors argue that this is because the neurons are very electrotonically compact, and current loss from distal dendrites is small. The experiments to show this are well done and convincing, including an interesting failure to detect a distance dependence of the apparent reversal potential of the synaptic responses. They do no experiments to determine how this compactness occurs, nor do they provide any explanation for this result. This discussion is important because to a naive reader the results appear to contradict simple cable property measures of current flow in branched processes.

Reviewers recognized that the main point may not be to rule out the idea that any dendritic computations took place, but rather that the slow graded signals characteristic of these cells are not greatly affected by morphology; nevertheless, it was acknowledged that this distinction could be emphasized further. As stated in the consultation, \"The main thesis of the paper is that a long length constant of the neurite allows voltages from anywhere in the dendritic tree to propagate throughout the cell with minimal voltage attenuation, so the passive properties of their specific cell morphology is a central concern.\" One way to address this point, would be to import a real GM cell morphology into NEURON and express their passive properties uniformly in all compartments to test (a) whether the voltage attenuation or amplitude at the soma similar for long currents injected in distal neurites and (b) whether the length constant depends significantly on direction of propagation. The outcomes could serve either to support the results or place appropriate constraints on the conclusions. However, the reviewers agreed to leave the specific way of allaying these concerns to you, i.e., such a model is not required if you find alternative ways to clarify and/or limit the conclusions.

The Discussion mentions two possible explanations for how neurons with very low input resistance can be so electrotonically compact: very low internal resistance due to large diameter of initial processes (though this would not apply to the fine processes where the input-output synapses are located) and possibly high membrane resistance at branch points (though this would not block the passive spread of current along the internal resistance of the branches). The reviewers pointed out that it would be informative for the estimates of the length constant (1.5 mm) to be integrated with measurements of the input resistance (~ 10 M\u03a9) to come up with boundaries of Ri and Rm (given that Rin = (2/\u03c0)(RmRi)1/2(d)3/2 for a semi-infinite cylinder, and \u03bb= ((RmRi)(d/4))1/2 (from Rall, 1977)."

The authors' argument is that the dendrites and soma are nearly equipotential, and that as a result inputs on any part of the structure have similar voltage contributions throughout the arbor. I don't see that this hypothesis has been adequately supported because the modeling does not take into account the actual neurite morphology the authors have quantified. The simulations in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> show that under conditions favorable for voltage propagation (a moderately large, constant diameter neurite exhibiting a long 800 \u00b5m length constant), there is still &gt;50% attenuation of PSPs along its length despite the fact that the Erev can be accurately measured at these same distances. But the authors show in several figures (e.g. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) that there are striking reductions in diameter in the more distal regions, which will impart a directional asymmetry in the efficacy of voltage propagation. In a passive neuron, centrifugal propagation will be more effective in a tapering structure such as the one exhibited by GM neurons, which help explain why Erev can be measured so effectively even at distal uncaging sites in experiments. However, propagation toward the larger diameter neurites and soma will be comparatively unfavorable. The simulations in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> may thus underestimate the attenuation of voltages during propagation toward larger neurites."

A higher local input resistance might raise the local PSP amplitude, but such a mechanism might be limited due to the proximity of the reversal potential to rest.

Presumably, the \u03bb of specific segments of neurite may vary, depending on their biophysical and geometrical properties. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, neurite diameters (at the photo-uncaging sites) can range between 0.5 \u00b5m <span class=\"underline\">&lt;</span> d <span class=\"underline\">&lt;</span> 20 \u00b5m. In another anatomical study (Otopalik, et al., in review), we find that diameters of primary, secondary, tertiary, and terminating neurites can vary widely. While there is a trend of decreasing diameter from primary neurite to tip, a given neurite path does not necessarily taper linearly or exponentially with distance. In fact, diameters can increase and decrease non-systematically with distance (this can be observed visually in the confocal micrographs)."

The authors' argument is that the dendrites and soma are nearly equipotential, and that as a result inputs on any part of the structure have similar voltage contributions throughout the arbor. I don't see that this hypothesis has been adequately supported because the modeling does not take into account the actual neurite morphology the authors have quantified. The simulations in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> show that under conditions favorable for voltage propagation (a moderately large, constant diameter neurite exhibiting a long 800 \u00b5m length constant), there is still &gt;50% attenuation of PSPs along its length despite the fact that the Erev can be accurately measured at these same distances. But the authors show in several figures (e.g. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) that there are striking reductions in diameter in the more distal regions, which will impart a directional asymmetry in the efficacy of voltage propagation. In a passive neuron, centrifugal propagation will be more effective in a tapering structure such as the one exhibited by GM neurons, which help explain why Erev can be measured so effectively even at distal uncaging sites in experiments. However, propagation toward the larger diameter neurites and soma will be comparatively unfavorable. The simulations in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> may thus underestimate the attenuation of voltages during propagation toward larger neurites.</i> "

Your measurements of ipsp amplitude after stimulation at a single point are examples of the first, while your measurements of the Vrev from the soma are examples of the second. I think this will not be a problem for your analysis, but it should be explicitly discussed in the Discussion. The integration of spatially distributed synaptic inputs by the neuron would be an example of current flow from the periphery to the center, and from basic principles might show more attenuation.</i> "

Put a different way, if a similar response is obtained from uncaging a 10 \u00b5m spot over a 1 vs. 10 \u00b5m diameter neurite (for example), does this not imply that there must be some other mechanism(s) in place to boost the amplitudes despite the 10-fold reduction in surface area and receptor density? A higher local input resistance might raise the local PSP amplitude, but such a mechanism might be limited due to the proximity of the reversal potential to rest. The authors have stated in their rebuttal that their concern is with voltage propagation and not local integration, but it seems to me that both issues are interrelated and central to understanding the results of their uncaging experiments.</i> "

Thus, we are left with receptor density as the main determinant in voltage response amplitude heterogeneity.
