Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Sally Lowell and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh\u2014including Mattias Malaguti as the first author\u2014supply a new twist to this story. They find that exposing pluripotent cells to different signals will pre-determine their fate: however, the process of differentiation can only begin once the expression of E-cadherin, a protein widely known for its role in cell adhesion, has been down-regulated (<a href=\"#bib6\">Malaguti et al., 2013</a>)."

Furthermore, in mice, this is achieved via the up-regulation of genes that code for Id proteins (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ying et al., 2003</a>). The BMP pathway is also involved in the formation and development of the mesoderm\u2014the layer of cells in the early embryo that differentiate to become muscles, connective tissues and some blood cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Kishigami and Mishina, 2005</a>). However, we know very little about the mechanisms through which BMP is involved in all these processes."

They found that <i>Id1,</i> a gene up-regulated in response to BMP signalling, is activated in those cells that lie at the posterior of the embryo and that are about to form the mesoderm: however, this gene is not activated within the mesoderm itself. Furthermore, treatment of embryonic stem cells with BMPs during the first stages of their differentiation did not necessarily commit these cells to the mesoderm. Rather, it led them to express molecular markers that are characteristic of epithelial, mesodermal and pluripotent cells, all at the same time. Therefore, rather than inducing mesoderm differentiation per se, BMP seems to instead \u2018prime\u2019 pluripotent cells, making them ready for this change."

This hypothesis is intriguing as it suggests that E-Cadherin is involved (along with BMPs) in inhibiting the differentiation of stem cells into neural cells. At a first look this would seem unlikely because although E-Cadherin has been implicated in the regulation of pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib1\">Chou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Faunes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Livigni et al., 2013</a>), it is best known as a protein involved in cell adhesion. The down-regulation of E-Cadherin is key for \u2018epithelial to mesenchymal transitions\u2019 in the early embryo: these transitions allow future mesoderm cells to detach from their pluripotent neighbours and move to form the mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib8\">Nieto, 2013</a>). Importantly, no such transition has been described during neural differentiation."

Further, the inhibition of E-Cadherin accelerated and increased the efficiency of this differentiation. This argues that down-regulation of E-Cadherin promotes neural differentiation, but does it mean that the main role of BMP signalling in pluripotency is to maintain E-Cadherin expression? This question was answered by Malaguti et al. with an elegant experiment which tested the effect of different levels of BMPs in cells where E-Cadherin has been inhibited. They found that low levels of BMP could not block neural differentiation when E-Cadherin is blocked, but high levels of BMP drove the cells to a primed mesoderm fate independent of E-Cadherin. Therefore BMP signalling has at least two separate roles in pluripotent cells: to repress neural identity by maintaining E-Cadherin expression, and to prime them for mesoderm formation."

And how does its down-regulation lead to differentiation? To start to answer these questions it is important to consider the series of events that leads to cells becoming destined to become neural tissue. In the mouse embryo, when the future neural cells lose BMP signalling, they start to express molecular markers that are characteristic of the future brain whilst remaining pluripotent (<a href=\"#bib2\">Di-Gregorio et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Osorno et al., 2012</a>) and continuing to express E-Cadherin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Malaguti et al., 2013</a>). This suggests that a cell\u2019s first step in committing to a neural fate is likely to occur after the loss of BMP signalling and before the down-regulation of E-Cadherin. As such, E-Cadherin appears to allow pluripotent cells to remain in a state of dual identity for a short time: during this time the fates of the cells have essentially been determined, but they still have the potential to choose other fates."

This would prevent the first cells that see the signal from \u2018jumping the gun\u2019 and initiating differentiation without their neighbours. In this way the cells in the early embryo would first respond to the different levels of BMP signalling: high levels of BMP would prime pluripotent cells to become part of the mesoderm, and low BMP levels would encourage differentiation into neuronal cells. Subsequently, when the levels of E-Cadherin are down-regulated, all the cells would lose their pluripotency and start to differentiate into their pre-destined fate in a co-ordinated manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Malaguti et al. suggest that exposure to different levels of BMPs can pre-determine this choice: low levels of BMP (top) prime the pluripotent cells to become neural cells, whereas high BMP levels (bottom) prime the pluripotent cells to become part of the mesoderm. The expression of E-Cadherin (Cdh1) in response to BMP signalling maintains cells that are already committed to a particular fate in a pluripotent stage: however, cells only differentiate to adopt this fate once E-Cadherin has been down-regulated. The cells that are primed to become part of the mesoderm express a specific molecular marker (T+) and undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as they differentiate."
