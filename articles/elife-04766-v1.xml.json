Building on previous work (Jinek et al., 2013), we show here that new genetic information can be introduced site-specifically and with high efficiency by homology-directed repair (HDR) of Cas9-induced site-specific double-strand DNA breaks using timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes.  Cas9 RNP-mediated HDR in HEK293T, human primary neonatal fibroblast and human embryonic stem cells was increased dramatically relative to experiments in unsynchronized cells, with rates of HDR up to 38% observed in HEK293T cells.  Sequencing of on- and potential off-target sites showed that editing occurred with high fidelity, while cell mortality was minimized.  This approach provides a simple and highly effective strategy for enhancing site-specific genome engineering in both transformed and primary human cells."
