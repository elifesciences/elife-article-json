How to prioritize <i>T. brucei</i> kinases and quantify their intracellular engagement by small-molecule inhibitors remain unsolved problems. Here, we combine chemoproteomics and RNA interference to interrogate trypanosome kinases bearing a Cys-Asp-Xaa-Gly motif (CDXG kinases). We discovered that hypothemycin, a fungal polyketide previously shown to covalently inactivate a subset of human CDXG kinases, kills <i>T. brucei</i> in culture and in infected mice. Quantitative chemoproteomic analysis with a hypothemycin-based probe revealed the relative sensitivity of endogenous CDXG kinases, including <i>Tb</i>GSK3short and a previously uncharacterized kinase, <i>Tb</i>CLK1. RNAi-mediated knockdown demonstrated that both kinases are essential, but only <i>Tb</i>CLK1 is fully engaged by cytotoxic concentrations of hypothemycin in intact cells. Our study identifies <i>Tb</i>CLK1 as a therapeutic target for African trypanosomiasis and establishes a new chemoproteomic tool for interrogating CDXG kinases in their native context."

How to prioritize <i>T. brucei</i> kinases and quantify their intracellular engagement by small-molecule inhibitors remain unsolved problems. Here, we combine chemoproteomics and RNA interference to interrogate trypanosome kinases bearing a Cys-Asp-Xaa-Gly motif (CDXG kinases). We discovered that hypothemycin, a fungal polyketide previously shown to covalently inactivate a subset of human CDXG kinases, kills <i>T. brucei</i> in culture and in infected mice. Quantitative chemoproteomic analysis with a hypothemycin-based probe revealed the relative sensitivity of endogenous CDXG kinases, including <i>Tb</i>GSK3short and a previously uncharacterized kinase, <i>Tb</i>CLK1. RNAi-mediated knockdown demonstrated that both kinases are essential, but only <i>Tb</i>CLK1 is fully engaged by cytotoxic concentrations of hypothemycin in intact cells. Our study identifies <i>Tb</i>CLK1 as a therapeutic target for African trypanosomiasis and establishes a new chemoproteomic tool for interrogating CDXG kinases in their native context."

Caused by two subspecies of <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, the disease begins in the hemolymphatic system and later crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier, resulting in sleep disturbances that deteriorate to coma and death. During the course of infection, the parasites evade the host immune system through periodic switching of the variable surface glycoprotein coat, making vaccination-based approaches unlikely to succeed (<a href=\"#bib43\">Taylor and Rudenko, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Horn and McCulloch, 2010</a>). Currently, only four chemotherapeutics are approved for sleeping sickness. These therapies suffer from poor oral bioavailability, severe toxicity, and/or emerging resistance. Eflornithine, the only drug with a known mechanism of action, is also the only therapeutic for sleeping sickness approved in the last 50 years (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fairlamb, 2003</a>). Although a combination of eflornithine and nifurtimox, a drug for American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease, caused by <i>T. cruzi</i>), was introduced in 2009 for <i>T. brucei</i> infection, no new drugs are near the clinic (<a href=\"#bib32\">Priotto et al., 2009</a>)."

As in humans, protein phosphorylation in <i>T. brucei</i> is an essential regulatory mechanism and plays critical but poorly understood roles in its unique life cycle (<a href=\"#bib30\">Parsons et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Nett et al., 2009</a>). The vast majority of the 182 protein kinases in <i>T. brucei</i> remain poorly characterized, and few have been interrogated in their native cellular context with small-molecule inhibitors. High-throughput screening and medicinal chemistry recently led to the discovery of SCYX-5070, the first reported protein kinase inhibitor with efficacy in a murine model of <i>T. brucei</i> infection (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mercer et al., 2011</a>). Affinity chromatography with an immobilized derivative suggested that SCYX-5070 binds at least six trypanosome kinases related to human mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and cyclin-dependent kinases, although the extent to which SCYX-5070 engages these kinases in vivo is not known. Genetic studies in <i>T. brucei</i> have established essential roles for orthologs of several human kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinases (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tu and Wang, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gourguechon and Wang, 2009</a>), Aurora kinase (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tu et al., 2006</a>), polo-like kinase (<a href=\"#bib19\">Li et al., 2010</a>), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ojo et al., 2008</a>), casein kinase-1 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Urbaniak, 2009</a>), and DBF-2-related kinases (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ma et al., 2010</a>). High-throughput RNAi studies have implicated additional kinases in <i>T. brucei</i> proliferation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alsford et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mackey et al., 2011</a>). Despite the knowledge gained from these studies, it is not clear which <i>T. brucei</i> kinases make the best therapeutic targets. Achieving sufficient potency to inhibit essential <i>T. brucei</i> kinases, while avoiding related human kinases, poses a significant challenge. Moreover, quantifying intracellular kinase engagement by small-molecule inhibitors in <i>T. brucei</i> is an unsolved problem. Pharmacological and chemoproteomic approaches are therefore needed to complement genetic studies in the search for new therapeutic targets (<a href=\"#bib23\">Moellering and Cravatt, 2012</a>)."

While protein kinases are attractive targets, elucidating which of the 182 <i>T. brucei</i> kinases to prioritize for drug discovery efforts is nontrivial. Many essential <i>T. brucei</i> kinases show high sequence identity with human orthologs, frustrating attempts to obtain selective inhibitors. Moreover, once a kinase target has been validated genetically and subjected to high-throughput biochemical screens, demonstrating that a given inhibitor engages the endogenous kinase in intact cells is difficult or impossible; to our knowledge, this has not been accomplished for any <i>T. brucei</i> kinase inhibitor. To begin to address these challenges, we have applied a combination of pharmacology, quantitative chemoproteomics, and reverse genetics to the CDXG kinases, a focused yet phylogenetically diverse subset of all eukaryotic kinomes."

Hypothemycin-mediated toxicity may be caused by inactivation of MEK and VEGFR2, as previous studies have found toxic effects associated with selective inhibitors of these kinases (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rugo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adjei et al., 2008</a>). Trypanosomes lack orthologs of most hypothemycin-sensitive mammalian kinases, including MEK and VEGFR2. Conversely, the majority of CDXG kinases in <i>T. brucei</i> lack clear human orthologs.

Indeed, hypothemycin was able to saturate <i>Tb</i>GSK3short at nanomolar concentrations in cell lysates, yet it had little effect on this kinase in intact cells, even after prolonged treatment at cytotoxic concentrations. Thus, despite <i>Tb</i>GSK3short being the most prominent protein labeled by <b>2</b> in lysates, it is unlikely that hypothemycin kills <i>T. brucei</i> by inhibiting <i>Tb</i>GSK3short.

Peptides were eluted using a 2\u201330% gradient of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid over 40 min, followed by 50% acetonitrile for 3 min. The eluate was coupled to a microionspray source attached to a QSTAR Elite mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Framingham, MA). Peptides were analyzed in positive ion mode. MS spectra were acquired for 1 sec in the m/z range between 350 and 1500. MS acquisitions were followed by 4 \u00d7 2.5 sec collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments in information-dependent acquisition mode. For each MS spectrum, the two most intense multiple charged peaks over a threshold of 25 counts were selected for generation of CID mass spectra. Two MS/MS spectra of each were acquired, first on the <i>m/z</i> range 119\u20131500, with Q1 resolution set at \u2018low\u2019, and then on the <i>m/z</i> range 112\u2013119, with resolution set at \u2018unit\u2019. The CID collision energy was automatically set according to mass to charge (<i>m/z</i>) ratio and charge state of the precursor ion. A dynamic exclusion window was applied which prevented the same <i>m/z</i> from being selected for 1 min after its acquisition."

Trypanosomes and their human hosts have many kinases, and to focus their search the authors selected hypothemycin, a small molecule produced by some fungi, that was known to target a small subset of human kinases, and found that it killed trypanosomes in both cell culture and in vivo (mouse) assays. They then synthesized an affinity reagent and through proteomic analysis identified eleven potential targets, all of which were kinases with the signature motif characteristic of hypothemycin-sensitive kinases. More detailed analyses identified one of the kinases, <i>Tb</i>CLK1, as the therapeutically relevant target, and this conclusion was underscored with RNAi analyses."
