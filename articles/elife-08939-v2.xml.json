                        "text": "The influenza A virus genome is composed of eight single-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) segments of negative polarity that form viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (vRdRPs) and nucleocapsid proteins (NPs). Both transcription and replication of vRNA are catalyzed by vRdRPs consisting of three viral proteins: PB1, PB2, and PA. Transcription of the influenza virus genome is initiated in a primer-dependent manner. The cap-1 structure of cellular mRNA was recognized by PB2 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guilligay et al., 2008</a>), and the capped RNA is cleaved 10\u201315 bases downstream of the 5'-terminus by the endonuclease activity of PA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dias et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>). This cleaved, short RNA with a 5\u2019-cap structure serves as a primer for the initiation of transcription. After elongation of the nascent RNA chain, transcription is terminated by a virus-specific polyadenylation mechanism (<a href=\"#bib42\">Poon et al., 1999</a>): vRdRP reaches the poly(U) stretch of the vRNA template adjacent to its 5'-end and is thought to slip there repeatedly, leading to the addition of a poly(A) tail at the 3'-end of the nascent viral RNA transcript. Replication of the viral genomic RNA takes place in a primer-independent manner and proceeds in two steps: in the first step, vRdRP synthesizes full-length RNA copies of positive polarity, termed complementary RNA (cRNA); and in the second step, progeny vRNAs are amplified from the cRNA template. Both cRNA and vRNA products from each replication step contain a 5'-triphosphate end group (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hay et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Young and Content, 1971</a>), indicating that both replications are initiated de novo."

NP is thought to play roles in efficient RNA elongation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Honda et al., 1988</a>) and regulation of vRdRP activity for replication (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beaton and Krug, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Newcomb et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Portela and Digard, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shapiro and Krug, 1988</a>). These observations, which were provided using mainly cell-free systems, concord with the fact that an in vivo viral mini-genome replicon system can be reconstituted by transfection of expression plasmids for PB1, PB2, PA, and NP and of a plasmid for vRNA driven by cellular RNA polymerase I (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pleschka et al., 1996</a>). These viral factors catalyze cell-free viral RNA synthesis, but at a limited level. Furthermore, cell-free viral replication activity using viral factors could be observed in the presence of a large amount of viral factors (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vreede and Brownlee, 2007</a>). In early cell-free studies using nuclei or nuclear extracts (NEs)\u00a0prepared from infected cells, a robust level of transcription took place and replication to some extent could be observed (<a href=\"#bib1\">Beaton and Krug, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jackson et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nagata et al., 1989</a>). Dissection and reconstitution of a cell-free viral RNA synthesis system using vRNP complexes isolated from virions, an exogenously added model RNA template, and uninfected NEs\u00a0indicated that host-derived factors could be involved in the process of viral RNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shimizu et al., 1994</a>). Using this assay system, we identified two stimulatory host factors, designated as RNA polymerase activating factors (RAF) -I and -II, which were identified as Hsp90 and UAP56/BAT1, respectively (<a href=\"#bib31\">Momose et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">2002</a>). Later, we found a factor, designated as influenza virus replication factor (IREF)-1, which upregulates unprimed cRNA synthesis from vRNA by the vRNP complex through promotion of the promoter clearance step and avoidance of premature abortive RNA synthesis. IREF-1 was shown to be identical to the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kawaguchi and Nagata, 2007</a>). Recently, several screening studies including high-throughput screenings have indicated that there may be more candidates for the host factors that affect viral RNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brass et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Karlas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Konig et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Naito et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>). Among these potentially relevant candidates, some were further examined and characterized using in vivo and/or cell-free analyses."

We found that a crude fraction of uninfected NE enables vRdRP to synthesize unprimed vRNA from the cRNA template effectively, and we thus designated the novel factor(s) responsible for this activity as IREF-2. Further fractionation and purification identified two host-derived factors, pp32 and APRIL. The target of these factors was shown to be a free form of the vRdRP trimeric complex. IREF-2 was found to preferentially upregulate vRNA synthesis rather than cRNA synthesis. Knockdown (KD)\u00a0of IREF-2 using short interfering dsRNA resulted in decreased levels of viral RNA in the infected cells. However, the primary transcription from the incoming vRNP complexes was not affected. These results suggest that IREF-2 functions as a host factor for vRNA synthesis from cRNA in infected cells."

This enzyme source was established in an early study (<a href=\"#bib47\">Seong and Brownlee, 1992</a>) and well characterized in subsequent studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Galarza et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seong et al., 1992</a>). These previous studies showed that mnRNP does not support unprimed vRNA synthesis from the cRNA template. NEs prepared from uninfected cells were fractionated through a phosphocellulose column by stepwise elution with increasing concentrations of KCl. P0.05 was a fraction unbound to the column, whereas P0.2, P0.5, and P1.0 were fractions eluted using 0.2 M, 0.5 M, and 1.0 M salt solutions, respectively. These fractions were examined individually in terms of their ability to promote cell-free vRNA synthesis reaction in the absence of any primer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lanes 3\u20136). The 53 nt-long RNA product was formed only in the presence of the P0.05 fraction (lane 3). The RNA synthesis was dependent on the mnRNP, c53, and P0.05 fractions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lanes 8\u201310). This novel activity present in the P0.05 fraction was designated as IREF-2. Next, we tried to purify and identify the factor responsible for the IREF-2 activity in the P0.05 fraction through fractionation using sequential column chromatography (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To determine fractions containing the IREF-2 activity at each column chromatography step, every fraction was individually assayed for RNA synthesis ability in the presence of mnRNP and the c53 model template, but in the absence of any added primer. On the basis of its chromatographic behavior, IREF-2 appears to be highly acidic. At the final purification step using an anion exchanger (the Mono-Q column), the IREF-2 activity was recovered in fractions eluted with about 500 mM of KCl (fraction numbers 6\u201310 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, upper panel). The fractions from the Mono-Q column were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lower panel). Comparison of the polypeptide elution patterns and the level of the IREF-2 activity strongly suggested that two polypeptides with molecular masses of approximately 32 and 31\u2009kDa corresponded to the IREF-2 activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, arrows). The 32- and 31-kDa polypeptides were designated IREF-2\u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively."

Each IREF-2 protein is able to exist stably as a monomer and functions redundantly in multiple biological processes as an I1pp2A (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 1996a</a>), a ligand to HuR that stabilizes ARE-containing mRNA (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brennan et al., 2000</a>), a component for INHAT activity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Seo et al., 2001</a>).

Either v53 or c53 was used as the model RNA template for the cell-free reactions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Notably, the unprimed RNA product was observed from the cRNA template in an IREF-2-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, lanes 8\u201310), but a significant level of cRNA synthesis was not detected when the vRNA template was used (lanes 3\u20135). These results suggest that IREF-2 preferentially regulates vRNA synthesis from the cRNA template, that\u00a0is, the second step of the replication mechanism. Furthermore, the effect of IREF-2 on cRNA synthesis from the vRNP complex was also examined (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Cell-free viral RNA synthesis using vRNP complexes as the enzyme and endogenous vRNA template source, that\u00a0is, the vRdRP and genomic vRNA of each segment, was performed in the absence of a primer. As previously observed, replicative cRNA synthesis from the genomic vRNA templates was stimulated by recombinant IREF-1/MCM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, lanes 6\u20138), which is known to stimulate promoter clearance during replication (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kawaguchi and Nagata, 2007</a>). In contrast, no significant change induced by pp32 was observed (lanes 3\u20135). This finding indicates that IREF-2 is not involved in cRNA synthesis from endogenous vRNA and that the function of IREF-2 is distinct from that of IREF-1/MCM. This observation also confirms the template polarity preference of IREF-2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

To date, no report has been published showing that pp32 and APRIL bind directly to RNA. In fact, the interaction between IREF-2 proteins and the model RNA template was not observed (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, we performed GST pull-down assays using lysates prepared from mammalian cells (HEK293T) expressing GST-tagged IREF-2 (GST-IREF-2). Forty-eight hours after transfection with GST-derivative expression plasmids, the cells were infected with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 for 6 hr, and the viral factors bound to the GST-protein were then analyzed. Each subunit of the vRdRP complex (PB1, PB2, and PA) was co-precipitated with both GST-pp32 and GST-APRIL, but NP was not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, lanes 2 and 3). Instead, only NP was co-precipitated with GST-RAF2p48, which functions as a chaperone for NP (<a href=\"#bib31\">Momose et al., 2001</a>) (lane 4). To further confirm this, lysates prepared from cells exogenously expressing polymerases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, lanes 1\u20134) or NP (lanes 5\u20138) and GST-derivative proteins were also examined. Exogenously expressed trimeric complexes of the viral polymerases were co-precipitated with both GST-pp32 and GST-APRIL (lanes 2 and 3), but NP was not detected at all (lanes 6 and 7). GST-RAF2p48 interacted with NP, but not with any polymerase subunits (lanes 4 and 8). Thus, we concluded that the binding target of IREF-2 is the trimeric complex of vRdRP, not NP. Moreover, the fact that the interaction between IREF-2 and NP could not be observed in the infected cells suggested that IREF-2 might interact with a free form of vRdRP, but not with vRdRP, in RNP complexes in infected cells. To confirm this, the amount of viral RNA in the complex of IREF-2 and vRdRP was quantitatively determined. Complexes of GST-pp32 with vRdRP were prepared from infected cells by GST pull-down, as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> (lane 2). The RNA pulled down with the complexes was then extracted, and the amount of viral RNA (here, segment 5) was determined by reverse transcription-mediated quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We found that 1 pmol of vRdRP complexed with GST-pp32 contains &lt;0.5 fmol of segment 5 (vRNA, cRNA, and viral mRNA) only, suggesting that IREF-2 tends to interact with a free form of vRdRP in infected cells."

And interestingly, the PB1-PB2 subcomplex was also found not to be associated with IREF-2, as shown here. This result strongly suggests that both the PA and the PB2 subunits in the trimeric complex of vRdRP are requisite for stable interaction with IREF-2."

By transfection with short RNAi duplexes targeting pp32 and APRIL, the expression levels of both proteins were strongly blocked (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Both the control KD and the IREF-2 KD cells were infected with influenza virus, and the intracellular viral RNA level was measured.

In both templates, the levels of three kinds of viral RNAs were shown to be significantly decreased by IREF-2 KD as observed in the infected IREF-2 KD cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). On the basis of the assumption that IREF-2 preferentially stimulates vRNA synthesis rather than cRNA synthesis, the vRNA level is expected to be more reduced by IREF-2 KD than the cRNA level in these experiments. In the case of vNS-Luc as a viral genomic source, the vRNA level appeared to be slightly more decreased by IREF-2 KD (12% of the control) when compared with the decrease in the cRNA level (23% of the control). Meanwhile, all viral reporter RNA levels were shown to be decreased almost comparably (46%-\u2013 48% reductions) when cNS-luc was used. From these results, the difference in the reduction level of vRNA and cRNA was insufficient to distinguish the effects of IREF-2 KD on vRNA and cRNA syntheses in these reporter experiments. This could be interpreted as follows: vRNA serves as a template for cRNA synthesis and mRNA transcription, and cRNA serves as a template for vRNA synthesis. Therefore, a defect in a certain specific step of viral RNA synthesis would influence the other steps and would result in declines in the accumulation levels of all viral RNA species, as observed in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib27\">Maier et al., 2008</a>)."

In infected cells, cycloheximide prevents the synthesis of viral proteins required for the viral RNA replication process, resulting in the blockage of cRNA and vRNA syntheses. Therefore, only viral mRNA synthesis from incoming vRNP is detectable in the presence of cycloheximide.

In the presence of cycloheximide, the accumulation level of the primary transcription appeared to be almost the same for the control KD and IREF-2 double-KD cells, while in the absence of cycloheximide, a significant reduction was observed in the IREF-2 double-KD cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These results demonstrate that IREF-2 had no effect on the primary transcription, consistent with the result presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> showing that IREF-2 had no effect on the cap-snatching transcription in the cell-free reaction system. Thus, it is quite possible that IREF-2 stimulates viral RNA replication in vivo.

These host factors are well known as members of the ANP32 family and exhibit high homology with each other. Both are evolutionarily conserved in many organisms, including birds and swine, and are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues, including lung tissue. Recently, an small-interfering RNA\u00a0(siRNA) screening study suggested that APRIL is a positive regulator of viral RNA biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib54\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>). In that report, the interaction between host proteins and viral factors singly expressed in mammalian cells was also examined, but interaction between APRIL with vRdRP subunit was not observed, and the authors speculated that the effect of APRIL on viral RNA synthesis might be indirect. However, we have shown that IREF-2 can interact efficiently with the trimeric complex of PB1, PB2, and PA, but not with any subcomplexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Therefore, APRIL seems not to be co-precipitated with any singly expressed vRdRP subunit (<a href=\"#bib54\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>). It is noteworthy that interaction between IREF-2 and the vRdRP trimeric complexes was observed in infected cells and cells cotransfected with all three subunit expression vectors, while interaction with the RNP complexes could not be observed in the infected cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). On the basis of these observations, the interaction between IREF-2 and vRdRP appears to be temporary during the process of cRNA template binding and vRNA synthesis, and once vRdRP starts vRNA synthesis, the associating IREF-2 protein may be released from vRdRP. The exact timing of the release of IREF-2 from the RNP complexes during replication, for\u00a0example, at the initiation step of vRNA synthesis, during the transition step from initiation to elongation, or during elongation, remains to be solved. Cell-free analyses clearly demonstrated that IREF-2 is preferentially involved in vRNA synthesis from the cRNA template rather than in cRNA synthesis from the vRNA template (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B,C</a>). The accumulation level of viral RNA in infected IREF-2 KD cells was significantly decreased, but not completely abolished (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This incomplete abolishment could be interpreted as due to the involvement of another unidentified host factor(s) in the viral RNA replication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that viral NS2 protein and virus-induced small leader RNA play important roles in the RNA replication process (<a href=\"#bib37\">Perez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Robb et al., 2009</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the negative effect of IREF-2 KD on viral RNA replication might be compensated by other host and/or viral factor(s) and/or other regulation mechanism(s) and that viral replication at some limited level could still be observed in IREF-2 KD cells."

Previously, Deng et al demonstrated that the initiation steps of vRNA synthesis and cRNA synthesis take place in different ways: vRNA synthesis is initiated in an \u2018internal initiation and realignment\u2019 manner, whereas cRNA synthesis is initiated at the 3\u2019-terminus of the vRNA template (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deng et al., 2006b</a>). The reported initiation mechanism of vRNA synthesis in this model describes that dinucleotide pppApG is internally synthesized de novo so as to be complementary to U<sup>4</sup>C<sup>5</sup> (in which the numbers indicate the nucleotide positions of the cRNA from the 3\u2019-terminus and are denoted as \u2018c3\u2019U4C5\u2019 in the discussion below). The 3\u2019-terminal sequence of cRNA is composed of 3'-U<sup>1</sup>C<sup>2</sup>A<sup>3</sup>U<sup>4</sup>C<sup>5</sup>\u2026 -5'. Therefore, this internally synthesized pppApG would be realigned to the 3\u2019-terminal nucleotide positions 1 and 2 (denoted as \u2018c3\u2019U1C2\u2019) of the template cRNA, followed by subsequent extension resulting in the full-length vRNA product. On the basis of this model (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deng et al., 2006b</a>), the differential effect of IREF-2 on vRNA and cRNA synthesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) leads to the hypothetical speculation that IREF-2 functions at an initiation process specific to vRNA synthesis using cRNA as the template. In another previous report by Zhang et al, unprimed vRNA synthesis appears to be initiated de novo at the c3\u2019U4C5 position of the cRNA template but \u2018realignment\u2019 does not take place. And vRdRP extends a nascent RNA chain from the internal position, resulting in a short vRNA product lacking the first three nucleotides at the 5'-terminal sequence of the authentic vRNA product (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>). In their cell-free vRNA synthesis system, such abnormal 3 nt-shorter vRNA was a major product, whereas full-sized vRNA was synthesized only to a limited extent at high concentrations of the UTP substrate. In our study, however, IREF-2-dependent vRNA products were shown to be exclusively full\u00a0length. Taking these results together, we postulated that IREF-2 regulates the initiation step of vRNA synthesis as follows: (1) by preventing improper extension prior to pppApG realignment, (2) by facilitating the conformational change of vRdRP and/or the cRNA template to promote the realignment, and/or (3) by stabilizing the initiation-intermediate complex when pppApG is already realigned onto c3'U1C2 and ready for proper elongation. To address these possibilities, further functional studies are needed."

                        "text": "In the two previous reports by Deng et al. and Zhang et al., cell-free vRNA synthesis could be reproduced without any exogenously added primer and host proteins, while in our cell-free system, no vRNA synthesis occurred without any added primer and host proteins, as was observed previously (<a href=\"#bib11\">Galarza et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seong and Brownlee, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seong et al., 1992</a>). They used recombinant vRdRP purified from plasmid-transfected mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deng et al., 2006b</a>) or baculovirus-infected insect cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">2010b</a>), while we used mainly mnRNP prepared by treatment of virion-derived vRNP complexes with MNase as the enzyme source. Therefore, the intrinsic nature of vRdRPs seems to differ one from the other, and recombinant vRdRP is possibly competent to initiate spontaneously de novo vRNA synthesis to some extent. Another difference among these enzyme sources is the presence of NP in the mnRNP preparation. At present, several lines of evidence suggest that NP plays a positive role(s) in regulation of vRdRP for replication and nascent chain elongation, but in the present study, unprimed vRNA synthesis employing mnRNP was not observed even in the presence of NP (lanes 2 and 10 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, and elsewhere). On the other hand, in previously reported preparations of recombinant vRdRP, some host proteins were possibly contaminated (<a href=\"#bib7\">Deng et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2010b</a>), and an unexpected contribution(s) of such host protein contamination to their cell-free reactions could not be completely excluded. The other point for consideration is that the amount of vRdRP used in the cell-free reactions was different. In their cell-free reaction systems, a relatively large amount (100 nM) of vRdRP was used for the reaction (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>), while we used a much smaller amount of the enzyme source (approximately 2\u20133 nM of vRdRP equivalent mnRNP) in the reaction. Hence, spontaneous vRNA synthesis in the absence of any primer and host factor might have taken place to some extent in their cell-free system. Taking such differences in the quality and quantity of the enzyme sources into account, it is possible that vRdRP intrinsically possesses de novo initiation activity and that IREF-2 may increase the turnover efficiency so that the apparent concentration of vRdRP seems to be increased. At this point, one of the primary interests to be addressed is whether IREF-2 exhibits similar stimulation activity as observed here in the cell-free system using recombinant vRdRP. In addition, the relationship between IREF-2 and NP has also not been addressed because mnRNP was used mainly as an enzyme source throughout this study. Therefore, NP-free vRdRP (i.e., recombinant vRdRP) seems to be a suitable enzyme source to address whether NP is necessary for the regulatory mechanism by IREF-2. These differences in the quality and quantity of vRdRP must be taken into account for further study. Lastly, we have shown by cell-free studies that IREF-2 is involved in regulation of unprimed vRNA synthesis but not of cRNA synthesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B,C</a>). However, it is possible that our cell-free system might not be completely appropriate or sufficient for cRNA synthesis from a vRNA template, and thus we do not exclude the possibility that IREF-2 also functions in unprimed cRNA synthesis. If virion-derived vRdRP, including mnRNP, could be set up to be adapted to the transcriptional mode rather than to the (cRNA) replicative mode, some process might be required for neutralizing the transcriptional mode of vRdRP or switching the mode from \u2018transcriptase\u2019 to \u2018replicase\u2019. Given this possibility, not only IREF-2 but also an additional factor(s) might be required for efficient unprimed cRNA synthesis in our cell-free system. To confirm this possibility, we are currently preparing recombinant vRdRP complexes possibly with the intrinsic property of influenza vRdRP as \u2018replicase\u2019 in infected cells for use in examining the effect of IREF-2."

The purified proteins were dialyzed with buffer H containing 1 mM DTT, and the concentration of each protein was determined by the Bradford method and comparison of band intensities with a standard protein (BSA) after separation by SDS-PAGE."

Both cRNA and vRNA have 5' triphosphate ends such that both are initiated de novo, not via cap-snatching as in transcription. This paper reports the identification of two cellular proteins that act to stimulate influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (made up of PB1, PB2, and PA), specifically to increase the second step of replication, the synthesis of new vRNA from cRNA, as assayed in reactions on short templates in vitro. The products were confirmed to have appropriate sense and 5' triphosphate ends. The proteins with this activity were identified as pp32 and APRIL. Both had been found in other proteomic or functional screens. The proteins were confirmed to only stimulate vRNA and not cRNA synthesis. Both were shown to bind vRdRP (and only as a trimeric complex) and not the viral protein NP. KD led to small reductions in viral RNA levels in vivo."

The active host proteins are identified by mass-spec as APRIL and pp32 and the effect is recapitulated with purified recombinant APRIL and pp32. These proteins are homologous, have independent and additive stimulatory activity and have previously been identified as influenza polymerase interacting proteins. They are shown to only bind to the trimeric polymerase, preferably in the 'free state' (i.e. not part of an RNP). Finally the authors show that siRNA knockdown of APRIL or pp32 or both in HeLa cells with subsequent infection by influenza virus leads to significantly reduced levels of all viral RNAs, vRNA, cRNA and mRNA, compared to the control infection without knockdown.

However the authors only show that siRNA knockdown of APRIL or pp32 or both in HeLa cells with subsequent infection by influenza virus leads to significantly reduced levels of all viral RNAs, vRNA, cRNA and mRNA. They argue that this is consistent with a specific role of APRIL and pp32 in being required for enhancing vRNA synthesis (which then has a knock on effect on other viral RNAs) but there is no direct proof that this is the mechanism in infected cells (except that they show there is no clear affect directly on primary transcription). For clarity and consistency the authors should also show growth curves for virus in knockdown and control cells and repeat these experiments in one other more relevant cell line (HeLA cells are very particular)."

Yet in an infected cell vRNA synthesis occurs in the context of a cRNP particle, whereas the authors argue that APRIL and pp32 preferably binds free polymerase. But free polymerase does not do RNA synthesis so how can APRIL and pp32 bound to free polymerase influence an initiation process that occurs buried in the internal cavity of the polymerase which is part of a cRNP? This paradox needs to be further discussed/explained by the authors."

In the case of vNS-luciferase as a source of the viral genome (Panel B, left panel), the vRNA level appears to be more decreased by IREF-2 KD (12% of control) compared with the reduction of the cRNA level (23% of control). Based on the assumption that IREF-2 stimulates preferentially vRNA synthesis rather than cRNA synthesis, it is expected that the vRNA level is to be more reduced by IREF-2 KD than the cRNA level in these experiments. Meanwhile, all viral RNA levels were shown decreased almost comparably (46%-48% reductions) in the case of cNS-luciferase used as a source of the viral genome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>, panel B, right panel). We consider that a convincing difference in the reduction level of between vRNA and cRNA could not be observed enough to distinguish the effects of IREF-2 KD on vRNA and cRNA syntheses in these reporter experiments. The stimulation effect of IREF-2 could be observed only in the case of unprimed vRNA synthesis in in vitro experiments as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, while both vRNA and cRNA (and also mRNA) levels were decreased comparably by IREF-2 KD in in vivo experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, and also <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a> shown above). A possibility for why vRNA and cRNA syntheses cannot be distinguished each other in infected cells had already been explained in the Results section (subsection \u201cEffect of IREF-2 on viral RNA synthesis in infected cells\u201d), as follows: vRNA serves as a template for cRNA synthesis, and vice versa. Therefore, if vRNA synthesis is impaired, cRNA synthesis (and also mRNA synthesis) is affected due to interdependency. This theoretically correct explanation has been already observed in a previous study (Maier et al.; Virology 370, 194-204, 2006). In their study, certain site-directed mutants of vRdRP, \u201cT173A\u201d or \u201cF176A\u201d substitution in PA subunit of vRdRP, were shown to have a significant defect only in cRNA template binding, but not vRNA template binding. Due to this selective defect in the template binding property, these vRdRP mutants exhibited significant loss of vRNA synthesis activity from the cRNA template in their cell-free (in vitro) reaction, but cRNA synthesis activity from the vRNA template of the vRdRP mutants was not impaired (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> in Maier et al., 2006). In addition, significant reductions of all 3 kinds of viral RNA species (vRNA, cRNA, and viral mRNA) were observed at comparable levels in in vivo experiments using these vRdRP mutants (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> in Maier et al., 2006). This previous observation by Maier et al., using vRdRP mutants appears to be similar to our results through depletion of host-derived factors by knockdown (in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

Is the nuclease and EGTA still present in downstream experiments? One can imagine the preparation is highly heterogeneous containing free polymerase, polymerase bound to the conserved 3' and 5' ends (which are protected from nuclease), nucleoprotein bound to RNA fragments, free nucleoprotein, etc. All these things could influence the fate of added cRNA or vRNA template in an artifactual way (e.g. free NP sequestering template RNA, etc.).

Biochem. 111, 496-499, 1992), 2 kinds of virion-derived enzyme sources, mnRNP (termed as \u201cMN enzyme\u201d in their report) and MNase/EGTA-free CsCl-RNP (termed as \u201cCS enzyme\u201d), were compared each other. There was no significant difference in the property of the vRdRP activity between these two enzyme sources (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> in Seong et al., 1992). This strongly suggests that MNase and EGTA used for the mnRNP preparation have no influence on the enzymatic activity. In addition, the heterogeneity of the vRdRP in mnRNP has been taken account in the previous reports (Seong and Brownlee; Virology 186, 247-260, 1992). The vRdRP with residual 3\u2019- and 5\u2019- terminal parts of the viral genome RNA (vRNA) protected from MNase digestion, can be detected as 14-21 nt-long short RNA products in a previous report (Seong and Brownlee, 1992) and also in our hands. Therefore, such short by-products can be easily distinguished from 53 nt long objective products synthesized from the exogenously added viral model RNA templates (i.e. \u201cv53\u201d and \u201cc53\u201d) used in this study. Related to these issues described above, brief explanation about mnRNP was added in the Results section (subheading \u201cPurification of IREF-2 from nuclear extracts of uninfected cells\u201d), and the previous literatures quoted for above explanation were also referred there and listed in the References."

The explanation about the influence of NP in the mnRNP preparation was added in the Discussion section (paragraph three). The relationship between IREF-2 (pp32 and APRIL) and NP is not addressed in this study.

On the other hand, 100 nM of vRdRP prepared using baculovirus expression was used by Zang et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 285, 41194-41201, 2010). However, it is very difficult to set up the reaction using 100 nM of mnRNP in our cell-free reaction due to the limitation of the stock concentration of mnRNP, which is prepared from a large quantity of virions (approximately 10-30 nM of vRdRP in our and other mnRNP stocks). Furthermore, an excess amount of mnRNP in our cell-free reaction system, if possible, is known to exhibit the inhibitory effect on the viral RNA synthesis even in the case of the ApG-primed RNA synthesis (Galarza et al.; J. Virol. 70 2360-2368, 1996). An exact reason for that is uncertain, and it might be plausible that an excess amount of NP accompanied with the addition of large amount of mnRNP in the reaction resulted in the inhibition of the reaction as observed in a previous study by Galarza et al."
