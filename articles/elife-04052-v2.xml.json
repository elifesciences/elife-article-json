Whether imp\u03b2 or RanGTP regulate the permeability of the NPC itself has been unknown. In this study, we identify a stable pool of imp\u03b2 at the NPC. A subpopulation of this pool is rapidly turned-over by RanGTP, likely at Nup153. Imp\u03b2, but not transportin-1 (TRN1), alters the pore's permeability in a Ran-dependent manner, suggesting that imp\u03b2 is a functional component of the NPC. Upon reduction of Nup153 levels, inert cargos more readily equilibrate across the NPC yet active transport is impaired. When purified imp\u03b2 or TRN1 are mixed with Nup153 in vitro, higher-order, multivalent complexes form. RanGTP dissolves the imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 complexes but not those of TRN1\u2022Nup153. We propose that imp\u03b2 and Nup153 interact at the NPC's nuclear face to form a Ran-regulated mesh that modulates NPC permeability."

Whether imp\u03b2 or RanGTP regulate the permeability of the NPC itself has been unknown. In this study, we identify a stable pool of imp\u03b2 at the NPC. A subpopulation of this pool is rapidly turned-over by RanGTP, likely at Nup153. Imp\u03b2, but not transportin-1 (TRN1), alters the pore's permeability in a Ran-dependent manner, suggesting that imp\u03b2 is a functional component of the NPC. Upon reduction of Nup153 levels, inert cargos more readily equilibrate across the NPC yet active transport is impaired. When purified imp\u03b2 or TRN1 are mixed with Nup153 in vitro, higher-order, multivalent complexes form. RanGTP dissolves the imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 complexes but not those of TRN1\u2022Nup153. We propose that imp\u03b2 and Nup153 interact at the NPC's nuclear face to form a Ran-regulated mesh that modulates NPC permeability."

Large cargos bind to transport receptors, such as importin-\u03b2, in the cytoplasm and are then guided through the pore. Once the cargo and importin-\u03b2 are inside the nucleus, a protein called RanGTP binds to importin-\u03b2 to release the cargo."

The experiments show that in the absence of RanGTP, importin-\u03b2 accumulates inside the pore and binds to a protein called Nup153, which is part of the complex of proteins that makes up the pore. However, when RanGTP is present, some of the importin-\u03b2 is displaced from Nup153 and leaves the pore, which makes it easier for cargo to pass through."

Lowe et al. propose a model for how RanGTP may control the flow of cargo through the nuclear pore by affecting the binding of importin-\u03b2 to Nup153.

The NPC controls the nuclear entry and exit of cargos ranging from single proteins to large ribonucleoprotein complexes (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stewart, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Peters, 2009</a>). Cargos smaller than \u223c40 kDa can passively equilibrate across the nuclear envelope while larger cargos must bind special transport receptors to move from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and accumulate there (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stewart, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Peters, 2009</a>). These transport receptors are able to bind cargos but can also interact with unstructured phenylalanine\u2013glycine repeat proteins (FG nucleoporins) within the pore. Directional transport of cargos is powered by the small GTPase Ran and a system of compartment-specific GTP hydrolysis and GDP-to-GTP exchange, which establishes a sharp concentration gradient of RanGTP across the nuclear envelope (<a href=\"#bib21\">Izaurralde et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kalab et al., 2002</a>). Importin-\u03b2 (imp\u03b2) and other members of the karyopherin family of nuclear transport receptors form a complex with their cognate cargos in the RanGTP-low cytoplasmic environment and release cargos upon binding to RanGTP in the nucleus."

A tacit implication of these models is that the diffusive movement of cargos through the NPC and the overall directionality of active transport are fundamentally distinct and separate processes. In this perspective, cargo\u2013receptor complexes are expected to equilibrate freely across the nuclear envelope in the absence of an energy bias such as the RanGTP gradient, and efficient cargo accumulation against a concentration gradient requires only the Ran-driven unbinding of cargo molecules from their transport receptors."

                        "text": "However, several intersecting lines of evidence raise the possibility that RanGTP influences the permeability of the NPC itself, rather than only acting on cargos once they have completely entered the nuclear compartment. First, early studies have suggested that Ran is needed for cargos to move through the NPC (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moore and Blobel, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gorlich et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Moore and Blobel, 1994</a>). Second, it was shown that Ran plays an important role in dissociating imp\u03b2 from the nuclear face of the NPC, in addition to displacing imp\u03b2 from cargos (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gorlich et al., 1996</a>). Third, extended tracking of cargos within single pores revealed a substantial RanGTP-dependent asymmetry in the cargo's exit step. Without RanGTP, cargos entered the pore but had an \u223c100-fold higher probability of exiting the pore at the cytoplasmic face than the nuclear face, suggesting that RanGTP influences barriers felt by cargo-imp\u03b2 complexes within the pore (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lowe et al., 2010</a>). The Ran-sensitive exit asymmetry of large cargo-receptor complexes suggests that a currently unexplained Ran-dependent process takes place inside the channel near the nuclear face of the pore at about \u223c70 nm along the transport axis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lowe et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Fourth, the overall transport success of large cargos appears to be more sensitive to RanGTP levels than other cargos (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lyman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Snow et al., 2013</a>) and thus RanGTP somehow influences the interplay of cargo size and active transport. This latter connection is not necessarily mediated by cargo multivalency (<a href=\"#bib53\">Snow et al., 2013</a>). Together, these observations hint at additional Ran-driven processes within the pore that are not addressed by current models of active nucleocytoplasmic transport."

In this study, we investigate the interaction of imp\u03b2 and Ran within single NPCs using quantitative biophysical measurements, and we relate those interactions to cargo translocation. We identify Nup153 as an important imp\u03b2 binding partner at the nuclear face of the pore.

Ran's effect on imp\u03b2 turnover, stoichiometry, and spatial distribution at the nuclear pore is characterized, and the imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 binding behavior is examined.

This assay yields nuclei with functional NPCs while allowing us to control the composition and concentrations of transport factors and cargos. A model cargo consisting of a fluorescently labeled tetravalent streptavidin (SA) bound to biotinylated imp\u03b2 binding (IBB) domains was used to examine cargo binding at the NPC. The streptavidin-IBB tetramer (SA-IBB<sub>4</sub>) cargo is large (\u223c218 kDa) and contains multiple import signals, as do many natural large cargos. In the presence of physiological levels of imp\u03b2 (1 \u03bcM, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), SA-IBB<sub>4</sub> strongly stains the nuclear envelope but does not efficiently enter the nuclear interior (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). This indicates that cargo molecules accumulate within the NPC, presumably due to their inability to complete their translocation into the nucleus in the absence of Ran. However, when RanGDP (5 \u03bcM) + GTP (2 mM) (henceforth referred to as RanGTP) is added, the fluorescence intensity of the nuclear rim drops while that of the nuclear interior increases, showing that the cargos then efficiently exit the NPC and accumulate in the nucleus."

This red-to-green replacement process can be quantified for long times with good signal-to-noise. In the absence of RanGTP, the photo-converted (red) imp\u03b2-mEos2 signal decayed to half its initial value within 3\u20134 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), showing that some imp\u03b2 molecules remain at the pore for long times.

Strikingly, however, some imp\u03b2 molecules remained at the pore for several minutes, even in the presence of RanGTP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

We were especially interested in the RanGTP-sensitive imp\u03b2 pool, since RanGTP drives active transport and RanGTP-induced alterations of pore organization could therefore be relevant to active transport. We directly imaged and localized individual Cy5 or Alexa647 dye-labeled imp\u03b2 molecules within the pore using dSTORM super-resolution localization microscopy (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heilemann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">van de Linde et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>; mean spatial precision, \u03c3<sub>x,y</sub> of 12 nm, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Well-separated peaks within this histogram, containing a threshold number of localizations, indicate the position of putative NPCs and were selected for further study. The imp\u03b2 localizations belonging to these NPCs were then extracted, rotated according to the interpolated envelope normal vector (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) and aligned along the transport axis.

Viewed along the transport axis, there are two pools of imp\u03b2 localizations separated by approximately 90 nm and occupying a footprint and spatial arrangement consistent with structural studies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Frenkiel-Krispin et al., 2010</a>). Antibody labeling of Nup358/RanBP2 (located on the NPC cytoplasmic filaments) with a second fluorescent dye was used to confirm that the outermost pool of the imp\u03b2 signal spatially overlapped with the cytoplasmic face of the NPC (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The central channel measured \u223c50 nm at the narrowest point, consistent with single quantum dot transport studies (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lowe et al., 2010</a>) and other super-resolution measurements (<a href=\"#bib29\">Loschberger et al., 2012</a>). The addition of RanGTP, which produces a transport-competent pore with active imp\u03b2 turnover, markedly decreased the total number of imp\u03b2 localizations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, \u2018RanGTP\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig3s1 fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1, 3</a>) but also changed the shape of the probability density function (PDF) of imp\u03b2 molecules within the pore. In the presence of RanGTP, the PDF is bimodal and shows a depletion of imp\u03b2 from the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, compare red trace to black trace). RanGTP was therefore not simply displacing imp\u03b2 from the pore but was displacing imp\u03b2 preferentially from specific sites within the pore."

Nup153 is an important terminal binding site for the imp\u03b2 transport pathway (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shah et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Walther et al., 2001</a>), can bind as many as seven imp\u03b2 molecules (<a href=\"#bib33\">Milles and Lemke, 2014</a>), and interacts with Ran (<a href=\"#bib46\">Saitoh et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ball and Ullman, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schrader et al., 2008</a>). Since Nup153 is essential for cell viability, we used partial RNAi knockdown to study how alterations of Nup153 levels influence the organization of imp\u03b2 within the pore. siRNA treatment led to \u223c70% protein reduction of Nup153 (\u0394153<sub>70%</sub>, <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Indeed, when Nup153 was reduced by siRNA knockdown, the dSTORM signal changed. The imp\u03b2 map shows fewer imp\u03b2 localizations overall and marked reduction of signal from the entire nuclear side of the NPC, creating an asymmetric, teardrop-like pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, \u2018imp\u03b2 \u0394153<sub>70%</sub>\u2019). Therefore, both addition of RanGTP and reduction of Nup153 alter the arrangement and loading of imp\u03b2 within the pore, especially towards the NPC's nuclear face."

To compare many NPCs without population averaging, we represented each NPC as a single vertical line whose color corresponds to imp\u03b2 concentration, ranging from blue to red. We placed each of those lines side-by-side, giving a \u2018waterfall\u2019 plot (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The pores with most of the imp\u03b2 at the nuclear face are at the left of the plots, while the pores with most of the imp\u03b2 at the cytoplasmic face are to the right. As can be seen, there is considerable pore-to-pore heterogeneity in the axial distribution of imp\u03b2 in all studied conditions. Some NPCs had a strong imp\u03b2 signal only at the cytoplasmic face, other NPCs had similar levels of imp\u03b2 at both faces, and finally, some NPCs had most of their imp\u03b2 at their nuclear face. The most notable difference was that when Nup153 was reduced, there were very few pores with a dominant imp\u03b2 signal at the nuclear face."

The addition of RanGTP increases imp\u03b2 turnover, depleting transport receptors from the pore. Partial knockdown of Nup153 reduces the overall imp\u03b2 counts and depletes transport receptors from the nuclear side of the pore, resulting in an asymmetric, cytoplasm-biased imp\u03b2 distribution. Together, these results raise the possibility that Ran can modulate the interactions between imp\u03b2 and the NPC. We then turned to a quantitative assessment of imp\u03b2 levels within the pore, to determine whether Nup153 is a dominant site of RanGTP-sensitive imp\u03b2 binding."

We thus used a single-molecule photobleach step-counting assay (<a href=\"#bib24\">Leake et al., 2006</a>) to estimate the numbers of imp\u03b2 molecules displaced by nuclear RanGTP at the NPC. Digitonin-permeabilized nuclei from wild type and \u0394153<sub>70%</sub> cells were incubated with imp\u03b2-mCherry with or without RanGTP and then fixed, yielding nuclear pores that can be imaged at the basal surface of the nucleus as bright spots (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Under the appropriate imaging conditions, discrete single-molecule photobleaching steps can be resolved in the fluorescence bleaching traces of imp\u03b2-mCherry at the pores (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The photobleaching fluorescence step-size, <i>x</i>, for a specific NPC, can be calculated by taking the first peak of the power spectrum of the pairwise difference distribution of the bleaching trace (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). From the fluorescence step-size and initial intensity, \u0394<i>I</i>, of the pore, the relative amount of imp\u03b2 molecules at a single NPC can be measured. Because of potential systematic errors in determining absolute numbers of imp\u03b2 molecules with this technique (e.g., homo-FRET, incomplete mCherry maturation), relative analysis of imp\u03b2 levels was performed by defining the imp\u03b2 signal of the wild type\u2013RanGTP condition as 100% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Wild type NPCs in the absence of RanGTP contained the greatest number of imp\u03b2 molecules (70 bleach steps counted), whereas RanGTP caused a 27% decrease in imp\u03b2 levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In \u0394153<sub>70%</sub> nuclei, we found a 34% drop in the amount of imp\u03b2 per pore without RanGTP and a 33% drop with RanGTP. These results suggest that most of the imp\u03b2 molecules that are displaced from the NPC by nuclear RanGTP are those that are bound to Nup153."

Imp\u03b2 was added to the nuclei before the cargo, allowing us to examine how cargo molecules translocate through pores that  already contain transport receptors.

We hypothesized that perhaps there was a significant amount of endogenous imp\u03b2, as well as other transport receptors, still residing at the pore that were not removed even after several wash steps during the digitonin permeabilization procedure. To test this, we performed an extra RanGTP wash step, in which Ran, GTP, and an energy-regeneration system were incubated with the nuclei for 10 min before being washed away. During this step, RanGTP will bind to and dissociate any endogenous transport receptors still bound to the NPC which are then subsequently washed away. In comparison to the condition in which imp\u03b2 and RanGTP are not added to the nuclei, the RanGTP wash did indeed make the NPCs more permeable (red curve), although they were still not as permeable as when imp\u03b2 and RanGTP are added together or when RanGTP is added alone (green and purple curves). This trend suggests that a subpopulation of endogenous transport receptors still reside at the NPC even after digitonin permeabilization."

By contrast, when RanGTP was also added, the permeability was greatly increased. The GFP<sub>3</sub> probe translocated across the NPC at a relatively slow rate with or without imp\u03b2 and RanGTP, likely because GFP<sub>3</sub>'s size is considerably larger than the passive diffusion size cutoff of the pore (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We therefore decided to focus on the GFP<sub>2</sub> probe and we used it to further explore the effects of imp\u03b2 and Nup153 on the permeability of the NPC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). First, we tested the possibility that general molecular crowding, for instance due to widespread transport receptor-FG nucleoporin interactions, was responsible for the observed permeability modulation by imp\u03b2. We therefore repeated the previous experiments with the related transport receptor transportin-1 (TRN1). TRN1 is the transport receptor for M9 signal peptide-containing cargos such as hnRNPs and belongs to the same class of karyopherins as imp\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pollard et al., 1996</a>). At 1 and even 2 \u03bcM TRN1, there was no strong effect on NPC permeability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), suggesting that general molecular crowding is not responsible for the changes to NPC permeability. Importantly, for \u0394153<sub>70%</sub> nuclei, addition of imp\u03b2 no longer restricted the NPC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Together, these results suggest that specifically the imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 interaction causes the nuclear pore to become less permeable. Furthermore, because the inert probes undergo purely passive translocation across the NPC, the reduced permeability must be due to a specific steric \u2018barrier\u2019 within the pore and not due to a block of transport receptor-specific binding sites. This steric barrier appears to involve imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 interactions that are very stable and long-lived in the absence of RanGTP. Indeed RanGTP causes the pore to become more permeable even when no exogenous imp\u03b2 is first added. This is likely due to endogenous imp\u03b2 and other transport receptors residing in the pore that were not washed away during digitonin permeabilization (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We turned to fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tetin, 2013</a>) to examine the structure's assembly and disassembly behaviors and requirements. The fluorescence intensity signal of diffusing imp\u03b2-YFP molecules (50 nM) showed a fluctuation pattern characteristic of freely diffusing proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). However, when Nup153FG (0.5 \u00b5M) was added, large intensity bursts appeared within tens of seconds. The appearance of these spikes in intensity (along with their corresponding long tails in the photon counting histograms) indicated the formation of large imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 complexes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, red traces). These higher-order complexes were orders of magnitude brighter than the freely diffusing imp\u03b2-YFP, suggesting that they are comprised of tens or even hundreds of imp\u03b2 molecules. The formation of large complexes can be explained by the many FG motifs found in Nup153's FG domain as well as the multiple sites on imp\u03b2's surface that may bind FG repeats. Notably, the addition of RanQ69L\u2022GTP (2 \u00b5M), which does not hydrolyze GTP (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bischoff et al., 1994</a>) and is therefore stably in the GTP-bound form, entirely inhibited formation of the complexes.

This is not surprising given that TRN1 is structurally similar to imp\u03b2 and likely also contains multiple FG-binding sites (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chook and Blobel, 1999</a>). However, although TRN1 and RanGTP are known binding partners (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chook and Blobel, 1999</a>), RanQ69L\u2022GTP had no observable effect on the TRN1\u2022Nup153FG complexes, suggesting a functional difference between TRN1 and imp\u03b2. Indeed, it has been previously reported that TRN1-mediated nuclear import is less dependent upon the RanGTP gradient than imp\u03b2-mediated import (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ribbeck et al., 1999</a>). Moreover, the passive diffusion assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) did not detect alterations of pore permeability in the presence of TRN1, suggesting that TRN1 either does not form a meshwork inside the pore or that a hypothetical TRN1-mediated barrier has significantly different biophysical characteristics (e.g., effective pore size) compared to the one formed by imp\u03b2. In support of both those possibilities, TRN1 has been shown to bind different sites within the Nup153 FG domain relative to imp\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shah and Forbes, 1998</a>).

Specifically, it was proposed that Ran is necessary for imp\u03b2-bearing cargos to move past a barrier located at 70 nm along the transport axis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gorlich et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lowe et al., 2010</a>). Based on the experiments reported here, we propose the existence of a Ran-sensitive network of interactions between imp\u03b2 and Nup153 centered at the nuclear face and including the central channel of the NPC, which contributes to the permeability of the pore (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Whilst other nuclear basket localized Nups, such as Nup50, have been shown to promote cargo dissociation from the pore in active transport (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2008</a>), Nup153 appears to also have a role in controlling bulk permeability of the NPC. The imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 interaction significantly restricts the ability of inert cargos to diffuse across the NPC, indicating the presence of a non-specific physical barrier that cannot be explained by simple molecular crowding. This barrier may take the form of a highly cross-linked \u2018meshwork\u2019 of long, flexible Nup153 FG domains fastened to each other by imp\u03b2 molecules, which we characterized in vitro at physiological pH and salt concentrations. The multiply cross-linked nature of these imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 structures may be reminiscent of the FG gel materials reported by others (<a href=\"#bib14\">Frey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schmidt and Gorlich, 2015</a>). However, these FG gels are held together by homotypic interactions between the FG domains; here, materials form via specific coordination between imp\u03b2 and the FG domains. Moreover, the resulting imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 material is dynamic, in the sense that its formation and final stability is sensitive to RanGTP, which can even dissolve existing large imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 complexes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The in vitro fluorescence fluctuation data obtained through spectroscopic studies of purified proteins correlate well with our localization microscopy studies of imp\u03b2's spatial distribution within the pore, where we see a sub-population of imp\u03b2 in the channel that is significantly reorganized by RanGTP. Furthermore, the photobleach counting experiments with wild type and reduced Nup153 NPCs suggest that this Ran-sensitive pool is predominantly located at Nup153, although the counting experiments do not rule out other RanGTP-sensitive imp\u03b2 binding sites within the pore. The sub-second turnover kinetics of the RanGTP-sensitive imp\u03b2 pool (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) are similar to kinetic values for imp\u03b2 turnover inside living cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rabut et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that our reconstituted \u2018in vitro\u2019 permeabilized cell transport assay recapitulates key features of transport in intact living cells."

We estimate that on average, 73 \u00b1 16% of imp\u03b2 molecules in each pore are insensitive to nuclear RanGTP and bound stably to the NPC for many minutes. These results, coupled with our observation that imp\u03b2 contributes to the NPC's permeability, suggest that imp\u03b2 is a functional component of the pore and does not just facilitate cargo translocation. Indeed, other theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that transport receptor binding at the NPC plays a critical role in the non-specific occlusion of inert cargos from entering the pore (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zilman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jovanovic-Talisman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zilman and Bel, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schleicher et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">Kapinos et al., 2014</a>). A functional role of imp\u03b2 within the NPC is particularly intriguing in light of the structural and functional relationship between karyopherins and scaffold nucleoporins (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sampathkumar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Stuwe et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that these two classes of proteins may share a common evolutionary ancestry. The possible functional and structural roles of the Ran-insensitive imp\u03b2 pool remain to be discovered. At present, we only know (1) that the bulk of these Ran-insensitive imp\u03b2 molecules are located near the cytoplasmic face of the pore and (2) that they are not bound to Nup153, since reduction of Nup153 (i.e., \u0394153<sub>70%</sub>) did not reduce the imp\u03b2 counts relative to the RanGTP condition."

The distributions for our counting experiments give an idea of the heterogeneity of imp\u03b2 binding amongst NPCs even within one nuclear envelope. The variability of NPC composition may reflect variation of the instantaneous functional state of the cellular pool of several hundred NPCs; perhaps, not all NPCs are functionally equivalent at all times. In the future, it will be interesting to directly relate NPC-to-NPC variation of molecular composition to possible variation of functional transport characteristics."

The microscope allows one to perform simultaneous high-speed widefield imaging with a controlled diffraction limited bleaching/photoconversion spot at the center of the field of view. Briefly, four lasers (100 mW 405 nm Coherent Cube, and 100 mW 488, 514 and 561 nm Coherent Sapphires, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) were combined and expanded to a similar beam diameter. Each laser was under the controller of a shutter. Half-wave plates allow for adjustment of polarization. A polarizing beam splitting cube (PBS) splits the beam into two \u2018arms\u2019. The \u2018focused spot\u2019 arm passes via a matched pair of convex lenses (f = 50 mm), one of which is mounted on a Z-translation stage to modify the focal depth position. An additional shutter in this arm allows for control of timing of the activation. The \u2018imaging\u2019 arm has an additional lens (f = 200 mm) in order to focus the beam at the back focal plane of the objective (BFP). The two paths are recombined using a second PBS and pass through a quarter wave plate before the remainder of the TIRF lens system to the objective (Olympus 60\u00d7 1.49 N.A. TIRF apochromatic objective, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) via a multi-edge dichroic filter (Semrock Inc., Rochester, NY).

Three lasers (100 mW 488 nm Coherent Sapphire, 100 mW 532 nm Coherent Compass, and 100 mW 640 nm Coherent Cube), each with their own shutter control, were expanded to the same diameter and combined using a series of dichroic mirrors into a single free-space beam. Half-wave plates were used to adjust the polarization before passing the beams through an Acousto-Optical Tunable Filter (AOTF, AA Optoelectronics, France) to quickly modulate laser power. The combined beams were again expanded and passed through a quarter-wave plate to circularly polarize the beam. For two-color STORM imaging experiments, we added an additional 405 nm laser (100 mW Coherent Cube), via an optical fiber. The free beam then passed through the TIRF lenses and was focused directly onto the back focal plane of the objective (Olympus 60\u00d7 or 100\u00d7 1.49 N.A. TIRF apochromatic objective) via a multi-edge dichroic filter (Semrock). We used the HILO method of illumination (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tokunaga et al., 2008</a>) to image a thin plane through the nucleus. An actively cooled EMCCD camera (iXon+ or iXon Ultra) was coupled to the camera port of the microscope via an additional magnifier. Laser shutter, AOTF, and camera firing were synchronized using a Data Translation DT9834 data acquisition module. Sample positioning was controlled via a micrometer stage with a XY-Nanopositioning stage (Mad City Labs Inc., Madison, WI or Physik Instrumente). Focal drift during image acquisition was corrected using an Objective Z-Nanopositioning stage (Mad City Labs or Physik Instrumente). Camera acquisition was at 40\u2013120 Hz.

The chromatic aberrations manifest as uncertainty in alignment and co-localization of molecules. STORM does not suffer from chromatic aberrations since both probe pairs use Cy5/Alexa647 as their reporter.

(2006)</a><span class=\"underline\">.</span> The stepwise-photobleaching method relies on the irreversible and stochastic bleaching of fluorescent proteins upon repeated exposure. The sample is illuminated with an excitation light intensity low enough to slowly bleach it until background emission is reached. Plotting the intensity of a spot of interest over time results in an exponential decay function. Ideally, this function contains discernible steps. Each step corresponds to a bleaching event of a single molecule. When the number of molecules to count increases, the chance of having several bleaching steps at the same time also increases, resulting in steps having sizes that are multiples of a single bleach step. We added mCherry tagged imp\u03b2 to permeabilized cells, fixed them, and imaged the basal envelope of the nuclei. The angle of the beam was chosen in such a way to minimize the background (normally just slightly higher than the optimal TIRF angle). The desired focal plane was found using the lowest laser power possible (\u223c150 \u03bcW) to avoid bleaching during focusing. As soon as the correct focal plane was found the laser power was increased to about 3 mW and movie recording was started. Movies were acquired at 50 Hz and normally have a length of about 180 s (or until background emission was reached). Four different conditions were tested: WT +Ran+GTP, WT \u2212Ran\u2212GTP, R<sub>70%</sub>Nup153 +Ran+GTP, R<sub>70%</sub>Nup153 \u2212Ran\u2212GTP."

The average image was treated with simple convolutions to achieve spatial bandpass filtering. We convolved the original image with a Gaussian, creating a lowpassed version. Convolving the original image with a boxcar function created a second lowpass image. Subtracting the boxcar filtered from the Gaussian filtered image resulted in a bandpass filtered image. This method not only suppresses noise (via an appropriate Gaussian kernel) but also sharpens the object of interest (by adjusting the size of the boxcar kernel) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Peak detection was done on the bandpassed image using the <i>ImageJ</i> plug-in <i>FindMaxima</i>. All local maxima were identified. For each maximum a flood-filling algorithm with a threshold gray level was performed. Maxima that had a previously filled area were discarded. For cases where several points had the same highest value inside the flood-filled area, the pixel closest to its geometric center was used. The output of the peak detection step was a binary image containing the locations of the maxima (or the geometric center in the case of multiple neighboring pixels). All spots detected outside the nucleus were removed by manually constraining the analysis to the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

For each region of interest a mask containing only its center point was created. These masks were then dilated with a three-pixel radius disk to create a region covering a typical nuclear pore. The time trace was then created for each pore by summing the pixel values inside the ROI for each frame of the raw movie. The raw signal was filtered with the edge-preserving Chung-Kennedy filter (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chung and Kennedy, 1991</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

For performance purposes, this part of the analysis was implemented in <i>C</i>. The distribution of the pairwise differences was calculated through a histogram with 500 bins. This pairwise differences distribution (PDD) ideally has periodical peaks separated by the most probable step size of the fluorophore (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This distribution was then smoothed and the individual peaks were extracted using a custom Matlab function. The mean differences between the peaks give a first approximation on the single-step size. To find the correct step size more accurately a power spectrum of the smoothed PDD was calculated using Matlab's <i>pwelch</i> function."

A major conclusion from this work is that Ran itself can modulate directly the permeability barrier, by modulating two (novel) Imp-beta populations that are located at the NPC. They use siRNA knockdowns and in vitro binding studies, to argue that this modulation can occur via Nup153. The manuscript is rich in experiments, and covers many interesting aspects that will appeal to a broad readership. There are several places though, that I find confusing, or where simple experiments to rule out alternative conclusions have not been made. I will go through these partially minor, partially severe concerns in the order the Figures are presented in the paper."

The observations in panel D-E) form the basis for many of their conclusions, and it is good to see that two different methods (FRAP, and photoconversion based FLAP) support their conclusion. With Ran, there is an enriched fast equilibrating pool of Imp-beta. This effect is then analyzed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> with STORM based superresolution."

What is clearly visible is that also two spatially separated populations of labelled Imp-beta along the transport axis can be found. This is certainly a very fascinating result, which also forms the basis for their conclusions. Convincingly (based also on the Nup358 analysis), one populations seems to be rather cytoplasmic, while the other is more nucleoplasmic. However, I have also some trouble following all conclusion and interpretations on this figure, as well as with some of the raw data and how it is displayed. In A) left panel, the Imp-beta is shown saturated (white color in the glow over low under representation), and the difference between the plus/minus Ran case is not that easily visible from the images (brightness is very different, and this is confusing, see below). The line profiles or projections (whatever it is) show a bigger difference, but conceptually I do not think this effect is that strong, that all types of definitive conclusions can be drawn from this. The apparent number of localizations went down, in line with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, but distribution change is less obvious in the raw data. This is also particular notable with respect to the data displayed in panel E and G. Here, the color coding show abundance levels, but in the white drawn box in (F), there are more abundant species (more yellow and red) than in the same box in E. This seems quite in contrast to the image panels shown in A. How was the data normalized and displayed? The difference between panel plus/minus Ran could also arise from different localization precision in the tow measurements. dSTORM is sensitive to high concentrations of dye, as multiple emitters could get activated, and then in the higher concentrated Imp-beta case, the clear bimodal distribution could get blurred. This technical issue could also explain the minor difference between the plus/minus Ran case. I do agree however, that in the Nup153 knockdown the distribution is clearly different. What does surprise me though is that I would have expected to see much less Imp-beta in the delta-Nup153 case, in line with the counting results from <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. However, the image here looks at least as bright as the Imp-beta minus Ran case. Either the authors were not careful with normalizations/averaging or contrast/brightness adjustments, or something odd is going on here in the entire <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. In the latter case, this would be a concern for a larger set of conclusions drawn in this paper."

Overall, this does not come very much as a surprise, since Imp-beta has several binding sites for FG repeats and this will lead to aggregation (the authors need to report the exact concentration in the methods part, and not just \u201cmicromolar for both\u201d). I assume, the same experiments can be shown to work with most transport receptors of this type and larger FG Nups. I would speculate, transportin will give the same effect, and they could easily do such an experiment. If also Ran can solubilize Nup153FG-transportin complexes, I wonder how such a generic mechanisms can be rationalized in line with i) their finding that in vivo the Imp-beta and transportin are doing different things (and how this in vitro experiment is then supporting their conclusions) ii) with their model of specific relevance's of certain proteins (Nup153 and Imp-beta)."

Besides not every aggregate necessarily also being a gel (their structures could be, but this would need different assay to confirm) their potential gels are conceptually very different than the ones originally introduced by the Gorlich lab. In their gels, the Nup is crosslinked by Imp-beta, while the Gorlich gels is based on homotypic interactions between Nups only. I think using the term \u201creminiscent\u201d as used by the authors is not pointing enough to the fundamental difference of their model. It also remains open, to what extend Nup153 is the only Nup that would cause such an effect. Other factors might certainly be important as well, but naturally, not everything can be addressed in a single study. E.g., a previous single molecule study that has directly shown that Nup50 is important for cargo dissociation of Importin complexes is neither cited nor discussed."

The selectivity and efficiency of transport through the nuclear pore complex is not fully understood. In current models, Ran in its GTP or GDP bound form gives direction to transport by modulating the interaction of Imp\u03b2 with its cargo's on either side of the NPC. The current manuscript provides proof that RanGTP influences the permeability of the NPC itself. Based on modern microscopy techniques that reveal the number, localization and mobility of Imp\u03b2 molecules in the NPC the authors propose that imp\u03b2 and Nup153 interact at the nuclear side of the NPC where they form a Ran-regulated meshwork. Transport experiments show that modulation by Ran alters both passive and active transport."

What is clearly visible is that also two spatially separated populations of labelled Imp-beta along the transport axis can be found. This is certainly a very fascinating result, which also forms the basis for their conclusions. Convincingly (based also on the Nup358 analysis), one populations seems to be rather cytoplasmic, while the other is more nucleoplasmic. However, I have also some trouble following all conclusion and interpretations on this figure, as well as with some of the raw data and how it is displayed. In A) left panel, the Imp-beta is shown saturated (white color in the glow over low under representation), and the difference between the plus/minus Ran case is not that easily visible from the images (brightness is very different, and this is confusing, see below). The line profiles or projections (whatever it is) show a bigger difference, but conceptually I do not think this effect is that strong, that all types of definitive conclusions can be drawn from this. The apparent number of localizations went down, in line with</i> <a href=\"#fig1\"><i>Figure 1</i></a><i>, but distribution change is less obvious in the raw data. This is also particular notable with respect to the data displayed in panel E and G. Here, the color coding show abundance levels, but in the white drawn box in (F), there are more abundant species (more yellow and red) than in the same box in E. This seems quite in contrast to the image panels shown in A. How was the data normalized and displayed? The difference between panel plus/minus Ran could also arise from different localization precision in the tow measurements. dSTORM is sensitive to high concentrations of dye, as multiple emitters could get activated, and then in the higher concentrated Imp-beta case, the clear bimodal distribution could get blurred. This technical issue could also explain the minor difference between the plus/minus Ran case. I do agree however, that in the Nup153 knockdown the distribution is clearly different. What does surprise me though is that I would have expected to see much less Imp-beta in the delta-Nup153 case, in line with the counting results from</i> <a href=\"#fig3\"><i>Figure 3</i></a><i>.

The goal of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> is to present spatial changes of imp-\u03b2 arrangement.

When Ran is added, we are dealing with an \u2018active\u2019 transport competent pore. The signal in the middle of the pore is now clearly bimodal and there is depletion of imp-\u03b2 signal at the nucleoplasmic face of the pore. Since these are all true probability distribution functions (whose area is always = 1), the PDF in the middle rises to compensate for the loss of signal at the nucleoplasmic side of the pore.

That said, we would not be surprised if a small number of other Nups also turned out to exhibit particular biophysical capabilities that are modulated by Ran."
