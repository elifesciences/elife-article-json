This pattern parallels enrichment for the meiotic chromosome axis proteins Hop1 and Red1. These proteins are important for Spo11-catalyzed double strand break formation; their contribution to crossover recombination remains undefined. Using the sequence-specific <i>VMA1</i>-derived endonuclease (VDE) to initiate recombination in meiosis, we show that chromosome structure influences the choice of proteins that resolve recombination intermediates to form crossovers. At a Hop1-enriched locus, most VDE-initiated crossovers, like most Spo11-initiated crossovers, required the meiosis-specific MutL\u03b3 resolvase. In contrast, at a locus with lower Hop1 occupancy, most VDE-initiated crossovers were MutL\u03b3-independent. In <i>pch2</i> mutants, the two loci displayed similar Hop1 occupancy levels, and VDE-induced crossovers were similarly MutL\u03b3-dependent. We suggest that meiotic and mitotic recombination pathways coexist within meiotic cells, and that features of meiotic chromosome structure determine whether one or the other predominates in different regions."
