MMR starts when a MutS homolog recognizes a mismatch and undergoes an ATP-dependent transformation to an elusive sliding clamp state. How this transient state promotes MutL homolog recruitment and activation of repair is unclear. Here we present a crystal structure of the MutS/MutL complex using a site-specifically crosslinked complex and examine how large conformational changes lead to activation of MutL. The structure captures MutS in the sliding clamp conformation, where tilting of the MutS subunits across each other pushes DNA into a new channel, and reorientation of the connector domain creates an interface for MutL with both MutS subunits. Our work explains how the sliding clamp promotes loading of MutL onto DNA, to activate downstream effectors. We thus elucidate a crucial mechanism that ensures that MMR is initiated only after detection of a DNA mismatch."

MMR starts when a MutS homolog recognizes a mismatch and undergoes an ATP-dependent transformation to an elusive sliding clamp state. How this transient state promotes MutL homolog recruitment and activation of repair is unclear. Here we present a crystal structure of the MutS/MutL complex using a site-specifically crosslinked complex and examine how large conformational changes lead to activation of MutL. The structure captures MutS in the sliding clamp conformation, where tilting of the MutS subunits across each other pushes DNA into a new channel, and reorientation of the connector domain creates an interface for MutL with both MutS subunits. Our work explains how the sliding clamp promotes loading of MutL onto DNA, to activate downstream effectors. We thus elucidate a crucial mechanism that ensures that MMR is initiated only after detection of a DNA mismatch."

Molecules of DNA form a double helix in which the letters in the two opposing strands pair up in a specific manner\u2014\u201cA\u201d pairs with \u201cT\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d pairs with \u201cG\u201d.

The process starts when a protein called MutS comes across a site in the DNA where the letters are mismatched (for example, where an \u201cA\u201d is paired with a \u201cC\u201d, instead of a \u201cT\u201d). MutS can recognize such a mismatch, bind it, and then bind to another molecule called ATP. MutS then changes shape and encircles the DNA like a clamp that can slide along the DNA. Only when it forms this \u201csliding clamp\u201d state can MutS recruit another protein called MutL. This activity in turn triggers a series of further events that ultimately correct the mismatch. However, it remains poorly understood how MutS forms a clamp around DNA and how and why this state recruits MutL in order to start the repair."

The structure reveals that two copies of MutS tilt across each other and open up a channel, which is large enough to accommodate the DNA. In this manner, MutS is able to form a loose ring around the DNA. The changes in the structure and the movement of the DNA to the new channel were confirmed using another technique, commonly referred to as FRET."

Further analysis revealed that that MutL binds to DNA only after MutS has recognised the mismatch and formed a clamp around it. This is the first time that the MutS clamp and the MutS/MutL complex have been visualized, and further work is now needed to understand how MutL triggers other events that ultimately repair the mismatched DNA."

The observed MutL<sup>LN40</sup> protein would then correlate with the MLH1 subunit (<a href=\"#bib62\">Plotz et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

A second event increases FP even more but reduces the FRET signal to below starting value (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This can be explained by release of the mismatch (unkinking) and sliding clamp formation.

At this time, since DNA has been pushed to the new channel, it is not kinked any more but kept relatively rigid by the MutL<sup>LN40</sup> binding.

                        "text": "Taken together, our data reveal how the large conformational changes within MutS after mismatch recognition promote MMR activation. In the mismatch and ATP activated state MutS pushes DNA into a new channel, which allows sliding of the protein over DNA. The new state with the clamps crossed over the DNA explains the stability of the MutS sliding clamp on DNA (<a href=\"#bib67\">Schofield et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lebbink et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jeong et al., 2011</a>), as electrostatic interactions between DNA and the positive charges lining the new channel may stabilize the new clamp conformation. The conformational change pushes the connector domain away from the center and on top of the ATPase domains, to provide a second interface for the MutL protein that binds to the opposing MutS subunit, while DNA in the new MutS channel can also contribute to MutL binding. This loads the N-terminal domains of MutL onto the DNA and the MutL binding delays the sliding of MutS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The loading step of MutL onto DNA is required for MutH activation and nicking (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Junop et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Robertson et al., 2006</a>), while UvrD loading and activation at this nick (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yamaguchi et al., 1998</a>) would follow similar validation. In this way, the requirement of the MutS conformational change for full MutL interaction is a sophisticated validation mechanism, which presumably is conserved in the eukaryotic homologs. It ensures that repair is only initiated when necessary, and due to the MMR system DNA replication can be completed with few errors incorporated in the genome."

This pushes the DNA to a new channel, where MutS fits as a loose ring around the DNA duplex and can behave as a sliding clamp. The N-terminal domain of MutL (green) can specifically recognize this state by binding two interfaces simultaneously. This loads MutL onto the DNA, where the N-terminal domains could dimerize and downstream effectors can be activated."

Crystal structures were solved in consecutive steps of finding domains using Phaser (<a href=\"#bib53\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>). Several search models were used, but best results were obtained with domains from chain A of PDB entry 1W7A as search models for MutS<sup>\u0394C800</sup> and chain A from PDB entry 1BKN for MutL<sup>LN40</sup>, while clear density for residues 150\u2013164 of MutL<sup>LN40</sup> allowed building as in PDB entry 1NHJ. The search process was improved by going back and forth between the different datasets to find missing domains. Initial structure solution was performed starting from crystal form 1 as follows: first, a search model consisting of residues 267\u2013800 of chain A of PDB entry 1W7A (MutS) was searched twice using Phaser, which resulted in a solution with these chains forming a tilted MutS dimer. Next, this solution was used together with a search model consisting of chain A of 1BKN (MutL<sup>LN40</sup>), which placed this protein against the ATPase domain of one MutS subunit. Then, the second MutLLN40 was found with Phaser using a brute rotation search of 15\u00b0 around the angle that would orient this MutL<sup>LN40</sup> on the other side of the MutS dimer in a similar manner as the first, and automated translation, packing and refinement steps by Phaser indeed placed the MutL<sup>LN40</sup> in the symmetrically equivalent position. One connector domain (residues 128\u2013266 of chain A of 1W7A) was then found with Phaser, and the second connector domain was placed using similar steps as for the second MutL<sup>LN40</sup> search. Thus the search identified the equivalent dimeric counterpart three times for separate parts of the complex (the main MutS chain, MutL<sup>LN40</sup> and connector domains). The resulting MutS-MutL<sup>LN40</sup> complex structure could then be used as a search model in all crystal forms and easily identified equivalent complexes in each of those (present three times in the asymmetric units in the 6.6 \u00c5 and 7.6 \u00c5 datasets). Finally, for crystal form 1, an additional \u2018half complex\u2019 was found with Phaser using one MutS chain and one MutL<sup>LN40</sup> chain of the existing complex structure. This second complex forms a symmetry-generated dimer over a twofold axis, with similar MutS-MutL<sup>LN40</sup> interfaces, but the MutS clamp domains in this crystallographic dimer could not be modeled. This second conformer forms a more compact MutS dimer, probably due to crystal packing, but since it has identical interfaces with MutL<sup>LN40</sup> we focussed on the main conformation throughout this paper. Excellent quality of the structure solutions after molecular replacement with the complete but unrefined models is evident from the Phaser statistics: TFZ = 9.0/LLG = 996 for 4.7 \u00c5; TFZ = 14.2/LLG = 899 for 6.6 \u00c5; and TFZ = 13.0/LLG = 795 for the 7.6 \u00c5 dataset."

Next, limited restrained refinements were performed, first using ProSMART-generated external restraints (<a href=\"#bib60\">Nicholls et al., 2012</a>) to the PDB_REDO-optimized (<a href=\"#bib38\">Joosten et al., 2012</a>) entries of chain A of 1W7A and chain A of 1BKN in order to ensure consistency with prior observations, followed by TLS and jelly-body refinement in latter stages. PDB_REDO-optimized homologues were used for external restraint generation in order to maximize reliability of the prior structural information. All refinements were performed using REFMAC5 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Murshudov et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2011</a>). During refinement, clear density became visible for missing residues 150\u2013164 of the MutL<sup>LN40</sup> subunits, which followed the conformation of PDB entry 1NHJ. Interestingly, this conformation was different from that in the MutL search model state, indicating this to be real signal, and not due to bias from the search model. Also, AMP-PNP could be placed in density in the nucleotide binding sites of MutS. During intermediate stages, PDB_REDO and MolProbity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2010</a>) were used to correct geometry and perform side-chain flips. After refinement, all structures were in the 97th\u2013100th Clashscore and 98th\u2013100th MolProbity score percentiles. Refinement and data collection statistics can be found in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Figures and videos were generated with MacPyMOL (<a href=\"http://www.pymol.org\">http://www.pymol.org</a>), interpolations between conformations were created with LSQMAN (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kleywegt and Jones, 1994</a>) and electrostatic surface with CCP4mg (<a href=\"#bib72\">Winn et al., 2011</a>). Protein interface areas were calculated using PISA (<a href=\"#bib72\">Winn et al., 2011</a>) for which the missing loop of residues 126\u2013131 of MutL<sup>LN40</sup> in interface 2 was modeled as in PDB entry 1NHJ."

The structural studies accompanied by FRET, crosslinking and binding studies show that MutS is converted to a sliding clamp conformation to load MutL onto DNA. The paper is well written and clear despite covering a lot of material. The crystal structures along with analyses resulting in many new insights provide at least two major breakthroughs: the MutS ATP bound conformation and the requirement of the MutS conformational change for functional MutL interaction: together these provide an elegant regulatory mechanism for commitment to repair. The additional analysis and testing via mutants, gels, FRET and SPR provide substantial added impact. This is likely to be one of the most important sets of structural results for the DNA mismatch repair field in the last 5 years. There are many novel insights that come directly from these structures and associated analyses, such as the ATP-bound MutS conformation and the rearrangement of the connector domain that creates a second interface with MutL to regulate pathway progression. Moreover, this work certainly advances our understanding of macromolecular machines in general."

The process of producing enough stable MutS/MutL dimer for crystallization efforts is itself impressive. The structures are without a doubt important and interesting. Three crystal forms were obtained, and all diffract to relatively low resolution with the best being 4.7\u00c5. At this resolution, care must be taken in structure solution and refinement to overcome the poor parameter:data ratio. The validity of the molecular replacement structure solution is pretty much beyond question, as the statistics for the placement of components are convincing and, of much greater importance, the same complex has been assembled more than once in the course of structure solution. The refinement has been carried out with care to avoid over-fitting, as indicated by the low values for <i>R</i><sub>free</sub> and the presence of unbiased features showing unmodelled loops and expected ligands. In addition, all the important conformational changes and molecular contacts inferred from the structure have been checked by FRET measurements and cross-linking experiments."

Yet, at a minimum, there should be at least some more specific discussion of this point with recent primary references that deal with a structural element that is key to the ATP-driven conformational change in the Rad50 ABC ATPase and likely in this similar ABC ATPase.
