Place cells, initially thought to be location-specifiers, turn out to respond promiscuously to a wide range of stimuli. Here we test the idea, which we have recently demonstrated in a computational model, that the hippocampal place cells may ultimately be interested in a space's topological qualities (its connectivity) more than its geometry (distances and angles); such higher-order functioning would be more consistent with other known hippocampal functions. We recorded place cell activity in rats exploring morphing linear tracks that allowed us to dissociate the geometry of the track from its topology. The resulting place fields preserved the relative sequence of places visited along the track but did not vary with the metrical features of the track or the direction of the rat's movement. These results suggest a reinterpretation of previous studies and new directions for future experiments."

Place cells, initially thought to be location-specifiers, turn out to respond promiscuously to a wide range of stimuli. Here we test the idea, which we have recently demonstrated in a computational model, that the hippocampal place cells may ultimately be interested in a space's topological qualities (its connectivity) more than its geometry (distances and angles); such higher-order functioning would be more consistent with other known hippocampal functions. We recorded place cell activity in rats exploring morphing linear tracks that allowed us to dissociate the geometry of the track from its topology. The resulting place fields preserved the relative sequence of places visited along the track but did not vary with the metrical features of the track or the direction of the rat's movement. These results suggest a reinterpretation of previous studies and new directions for future experiments."

That there is a considerable gulf between place cell firing and a cognitive spatial map, however, has become only clearer with time. Place cells appear to respond to a perplexing array of stimuli, from visual cues to head direction, goal planning, color changes, shape changes, and olfactory, vestibular and kinesthetic inputs, and discrepancies between the expected and actual location of a target (<a href=\"#bib40\">Harnad, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Frank et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Wood et al., 2000</a>); recent work has shown that both spatial and nonspatial cell types in the entorhinal cortex provide myriad inputs to the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ideker et al., 2011</a>). The fascination with place cell promiscuity, however, has tended to distract from the fact that cognition is the work not of individual neurons but of large ensembles of cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ludvig, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Fenton et al., 2008</a>). The nature of the information embedded in the place cell ensemble code and transmitted to downstream neurons has been largely ignored, along with the consequences for the type of spatial properties that might form the basis for the cognitive map."

The only information they receive is contained in the temporal pattern of the spike trains of the thousands of place cells that are active in a given environment. What sort of information about a space might be constructed from such signals? The dominant assumption within the field of neuroscience has been that the hippocampal spatial map\u2014if there is one (<a href=\"#bib24\">Eichenbaum et al., 1999</a>)\u2014is an allothetic, Euclidian representation of the local environment that integrates detailed information about distances and angles arising through self-motion, head direction, and speed in addition to visual and other cues (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wills et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Erdem and Hasselmo, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Rubin et al., 2014</a>). The compilation of such geometric data would seem to require considerable computational power for the spatial map to be formed quickly enough to be useful under normal conditions of animal navigation (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Frank et al., 2004</a>). Geometry is not the only aspect of space that can form the basis of a map, however. From a practical standpoint, the topological qualities of a space\u2014relations between locations such as continuity, enclosure, sequence (<a href=\"#bib68\">Poincar\u00e9, 1895</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aleksandrov, 1965</a>)\u2014are arguably even more important (<a href=\"#bib70\">Poucet, 1993</a>). Yet scant attention has been paid to the possible role of topological features in the cognitive map, despite the fact that any movement through space is describable in topological terms (locations A and B must be somehow connected if movement between them is possible). This neglect is even more curious in light of Piaget's early work indicating that children first represent space topologically and only later learn to incorporate metrical details into their mental representations of space (<a href=\"#bib70\">Poucet, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</a>). A few studies have shown that place cell firing is responsive to topological changes in the environment such as the placement or removal of a barrier across a previously learned route (<a href=\"#bib69\">Poucet and Herrmann, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alvernhe et al., 2011</a>), but as noted above, place cells seem to be responsive to an enormous variety of inputs. Our interest ultimately is not whether place cells can respond to topological features of a space, but whether the information conveyed downstream by place cell spiking might encode topological information, which would offer considerable advantages over geometry in terms of computational speed and flexibility."

                        "text": "There are two compelling reasons to consider such a radical departure from the dominant assumptions about the spatial component of the cognitive map. First is the nature of place cell firing. If, in fact, place cell co-firing implies spatial overlap of place fields (<a href=\"#bib57\">McNaughton et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brown et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Jensen and Lisman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Barbieri et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Guger et al., 2011</a>), then a map derived from place cell spiking will necessarily emphasize contiguities between locations as well as the temporal sequence in which they are experienced. (The reason we include temporal sequence along with more conventional spatial relationships is because movement through space takes place over time; sequence thus embodies connectivity.) This would seem to be more compatible with the broader role of the hippocampus in representing and storing experience. Second, how geometric changes would be transmitted downstream as metrical changes per se is unclear; precisely because place cells respond to so many inputs, a change in firing rate within a period of overlap might just as well reflect a change in the animal's speed or some other input as it would a change in distance. <a href=\"#bib62\">Muller and Kubie (1987)</a> found that enlarging their open field set-up caused place fields to enlarge while maintaining the same shape and relative order (i.e., the connectivity of the environment remained invariant). Similar observations were made by <a href=\"#bib90\">Gothard et al., 1996a</a> on a linear track, by <a href=\"#bib65\">O'Keefe and Burgess (1996)</a> in rectangular environments, and by other studies in morphing environments (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lever et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Touretzky et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wills et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Colgin et al., 2010</a>). O'Keefe et al. (<a href=\"#bib65\">O'Keefe and Burgess, 1996</a>) reasoned that the responses of the place fields could be described in terms of the geometric characteristics of the deforming environment, such as the altered distances to the walls of the enclosure. If we consider the information available to the downstream neurons that \u2018read\u2019 spiking coactivity, however, this explanation becomes a bit less plausible. As adjacent place fields enlarge in response to an expanded environment, the place cells will still be coactive, and the readout to the downstream neurons will be much the same. Thus, even if the place field layout stretches significantly, the corresponding geometrical information will not necessarily be captured by the downstream networks unless the change is quite large. Note that this phenomenon of place field stretching has a topological quality to it, since the fields stretch with the space but maintain their relative positions and order. In this context it is interesting to note that a more detailed analysis of place cell activity in a stretching <i>1D</i> environment (<a href=\"#bib20\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2008</a>) showed that the temporal gaps between the spikes of the respective place cells remain fixed throughout the stretch, despite the change in the overall firing rate (rate remapping, <a href=\"#bib23\">Dupret et al., 2010</a>). Mathematically speaking, this suggests that spatial information contained in the hippocampal map may be invariant with respect to a certain range of geometric transformations, so that the flexible arrangement of place fields does not represent specific locations on a Cartesian grid, but rather a coarser framework of spatiotemporal relationships."

The way place fields cover a space actually calls to mind a fundamental theorem in algebraic topology that holds that a given space, if covered by a sufficient number of discrete sub-regions, can be reconstructed by the pattern of overlaps between those sub-regions (a simplicial complex) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hatcher, 2002</a>). This theorem is key to the power of topological approaches to resolve otherwise overwhelmingly complex problems in high-dimensional data analysis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lum et al., 2013</a>), and it lends itself to the problem at hand. We recently developed a computational algorithm based on algebraic topology to simulate the behavior of a rat exploring several different environments (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dabaghian et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Arai et al., 2014</a>). We created a wide range of testable values for three parameters\u2014place cell firing rate, number of place cells, and place field size\u2014and showed that simulated groups of neurons accurately encode spatial information from topologically distinct environments (they \u2018learn\u2019 the space) when the parameter values happen to closely parallel biological values derived from animal experiments. Since we made no a priori assumptions about what values would work, this was a promising validation of our model. We subsequently included theta precession in the model and showed that theta oscillation affects the behavior of the neuronal ensemble in ways that augment its performance to enhance learning (<a href=\"#bib6\">Arai et al., 2014</a>)."

The dynamic configurations of the track were mapped against a stable set of spatial bins, which allowed us to dissociate two frames of reference: the effects produced on the CA1 place cells by changes in the track configuration can be described either in the reference frame associated with the room (the 2<i>D</i> planar reference frame) or with the track itself (the 1<i>D</i> linear reference frame). If path-integrating the 2<i>D</i> displacements, velocities and acceleration produces place fields that from an allocentric, Cartesian coordinate map of the space, the place fields should be relatively stable in the 2<i>D</i> plane, remaining in the same spatial bins despite changing track segments, and variable in the 1<i>D</i> frame of reference (See <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure Supplement 1</a>). In contrast, if the place cells attend to the sequence and connectivity of places experienced on the track irrespective of the track's geometry and the directions and angles of the rat's movements, then the place fields will be stable in the linear reference frame, but variable in the planar (<i>2D</i>) reference frame."

We quantified this tendency by computing the correlation between the firing rates in the planar and linear reference frames for all pairs of configurations. Because any two linearized track configurations are geometrically identical, whereas only a few parts of the <i>2D</i> track configurations overlap, we computed the correlations using only the spatial bins that were visited and where at least one spike was fired in both <i>1D</i> and <i>2D</i> configurations (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

Therefore, all the correlation coefficients with the same difference between the first and the second index, <i>C</i><sub><i>i,i+d</i></sub>, will describe the correlations between \u2018equally dissimilar\u2019 track configurations separated by <i>d</i> bins and appear on the <i>d</i>-th subdiagonal of the correlation matrix. Their average value, <i>r</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> = &lt; <i>C</i><sub><i>i,i+d</i></sub> &gt;, thus characterizes the mean correlation for a given degree of dissimilarity, and the decay of <i>r</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> as a function of <i>d</i> characterizes the decay of correlations as a function of the difference between track geometries. The matrices in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> show that the correlations computed in the <i>2D</i> reference frame decayed rapidly as more geometrically dissimilar configurations were compared. In contrast, the linear correlations remained high even for the fully expanded configuration. The difference in the mean correlation is highly significant (p &lt; 0.001, two sample <i>t</i> tests) for each point (all values of <i>d</i>) on both curves (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The high values of the correlation coefficients for individual neurons in the linear case also show that the place fields were stable, despite the fact that active place cells could produce only a few spikes during the animal's single run through the corresponding place field in each track configuration, the effect of which was to create greater variability in our estimates of the firing rate and reduce the value of correlation coefficients (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To this end, we also examined cells that were active on the static portions of the track (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013F</a>) and found that they demonstrated uniformly high correlation values for both reference frames (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013H</a>). For these cells, the average values of the inter-configuration correlation coefficients in the<i>1D</i> and the <i>2D</i> case did not diverge: the place fields of these neurons were stable despite the motion of other track elements. This demonstrates that place fields on the moving segments shift in <i>2D</i> not because of some general instability but because they are, in fact, responding to changes in the configuration of the track."

The animals were avidly curious about the space around the elevated track, and their deft performance on the constantly changing (if faintly glowing) track in a dark room suggests that the proprioceptive and idiothetic information required for such behavior was available to the animals because of the anatomical connections to the hippocampus (e.g., with head direction cells [<a href=\"#bib12\">Calton et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Navratilova et al., 2012</a>] and other inputs [<a href=\"#bib76\">Sharp et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Muir and Bilkey, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lu and Bilkey, 2010</a>]).

Such a reduced path integration mechanism is sometimes expanded ad hoc to include place cell binding to local features of the track, such as joints or segments (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">O'Keefe and Burgess, 1996</a>). To evaluate these possibilities, we carried out an additional experiment in two animals on a U-shaped track that consisted of 11 segments, three of which could form a protrusion on either of the two sides (Track B, see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The geometric transformation in this case consisted of keeping the protrusion on one side of the track during the first session and then flipping it to the other side during the second session. The starting side for the protrusion alternated each day. On days 1, 3, and 5 during the first 20-min running session, the protrusion was formed by segments 3, 4 and 5; during the following 20 min running session, segments 7-8-9 formed the protrusion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). On days 2, 4 and 6 the protrusion first appeared in position 7-8-9 and then flipped to the opposite side for the second session (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). In order to enter the protrusion area, the animal turned to the right on its inbound journeys and to the left on its outbound journeys during both runs, before and after the flip of the protrusion. The protrusion switch thus did not affect the sequence of turns but did produce a local deformation of space, which altered the relative arrangement of the track's segments and changed the distance relationships between locations on it. As before, the deformation did not violate the track's topological structure. Unlike the Track A experiment, however, the geometry of track B changed discontinuously, as the animal was physically taken off the track between the two running sessions."

If so, place fields would tend to move from one side of the track to the other with the protrusion. Second, we could verify whether place cell activity was determined by the animal's linear distance along the track. If this were the case, a population of place cells would remain active at the same distances from the ends of the track before and after the protrusion switch, that is, they would shift along the track as a result of the protrusion's flip. In contrast, our topological model would predict that the place field in the region of the protrusion should not flip over or shift; instead, it should simply stretch and shrink as the protrusion is inserted and removed. So if place cell spiking activity represents connectivity, the place fields on the section of track replaced by the protrusion should extend continuously into the space provided by the protrusion."

Remarkably, the rescaled correlates were not only significantly larger than those of the local features (case 1) and distance (case 2) scenarios, but also were larger than the protruding segment correlations, indicating that local stretching could describe a greater amount of the variability in place fields than path integration (non-parametric <i>u</i>-tests, which give the p values 10<sup>\u22125</sup> for the differences and one way ANOVA, Tukey\u2013Kramer post-hoc tests, p\u2019s &lt; 10<sup>\u22124</sup>).

We hypothesize that, were we able to carry out this experiment using a continuous transformation from the straight section of the track to the protrusion, as we were able to do with Track A, the hippocampal network would have retained a greater degree of similarity across the configurations. Nevertheless, the difference in the correlations between these four cases was statistically significant. The fact that both the mean and individual place cell activity across the two sessions showed the highest correlation after the rescaling transformation was applied, while the \u2018Distance\u2019 and \u2018Flip\u2019 correlations were low, suggests that place cell firing, despite its variability, served primarily to represent the connectivity of the environment through the temporal sequence of place cell activity.

Indeed, one study found that cells in the rat medial prefrontal cortex, recipients of place cell efferents, did not fire in response to the rat's position or head direction but rather in response to specific goal-oriented behaviors (<a href=\"#bib71\">Poucet, 1997</a>)."

We suggest that place cells emphasize the connections between portions of a given environment and the sequence in which they are experienced. Such an encoded sequence is evident in spontaneous replays of place cell spiking during quiescent (<a href=\"#bib63\">Muller and Kubie, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Davidson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carr et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zeithamova et al., 2012</a>) and sleep states (<a href=\"#bib77\">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Louie and Wilson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>), which recapitulate the order in which the place cells fired during navigation. This implies that when the hippocampal network is driven internally, the structure of sequences remains the same as during navigation, although the activity of place cells under these circumstances is clearly not coupled directly with spatial locations. The encoded map thus appears to serve as a template for generating replay sequences and facilitating imaginative navigation. More recently, studies of hippocampal preplay (as opposed to replay) indicate that the hippocampus has a repertoire of preconfigured temporal place cell firing sequences that can be called upon to rapidly encode multiple novel spatial experiences (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</a>). It is striking that studies from such diverse fields, from electrophysiology to algebraic topology, seem to converge on the notion that the hippocampus operates by providing a flexible, rough-and-ready framework into which spatially grounded experiences can be organized and remembered."

It is well known that if the environment changes significantly, then place cell activity can undergo global remapping, and if the changes are small, then the place cells preserve the relative order of spiking and respond only by a regular change of their spiking rates (rate remapping) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Colgin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2012</a>). Our topological hypothesis predicts that, within limits (which are as yet unknown), geometric transformations should cause only rate remapping while the sequence of firing remains invariant. Our topological model would also greatly narrow the realm of meaningful correlations between changes in visual cues and responses in place cell spiking. As we have tried to emphasize in this work, a place cell response does not necessarily translate into information communicated downstream. In the absence of global remapping, it may thus not be safe to interpret correlations between changes in stimuli and place cell activity as representing information that is transmitted to other brain regions. A change in response would primarily serve to establish the scope of geometric invariance, which could depend on a variety of biological conditions and which is a question that must be left for future investigations. Moreover, since the sequence of spaces traversed is encoded in ensembles of place cells rather than individual neurons, it is place cell ensembles, not individual neurons, whose responses to changes in the environment need to be studied. This of course poses technical challenges, but such challenges are more likely to be met if we see the necessity of doing so."

It is not entirely clear how the same mechanism would be responsible for representing geometry (distances and angles) in the spatial domain and encoding sequences and events in the mnemonic domain.

The entire visible space was thus concentrated around the track.

Given that place cells are highly variable (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brown et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fenton and Muller, 1998</a>), we combined multiple passes through a given place field in similar track geometries in order to obtain meaningful results (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). This reduced the variability of our estimates of the rate while preserving distinct estimates for different shapes. Nonetheless, our estimates were based on relatively few (3 to 7) passes through each location, which lowers the correlations of place cell activity rates on the moving segments of the track, as compared to the stable segments (5 and 6). For this reason, we analyzed the spiking occurring on the mobile sections of the track (sections 1\u20134 and 7\u201310) separately from the spiking at fixed regions (sections 5\u20136)."

Without these kinds of data, the \u201ctopological template\u201d and other descriptions of hippocampal function become quite similar, e.g. to Eichenbaum's \u201cmemory map\u201d and Worden's \u201cfragment fitting\u201d ideas."

They find that place cell firing across the maze configurations is more consistent (higher correlation) if the end of the arm is the origin of the coordinate system than if a standard Euclidean system is used. It seems that the essence of the central claim is that place cell discharge encodes topological rather than geometric variables. If this is the case then the authors should be able to better decode the topological variables than the geometric variables. An appropriate comparative decoding analysis should be done to evaluate this core assumption."

(J Neurosci 1996a), and Redish et al., (J Neurosci 2000), experimentalists have done similar manipulations and recordings to the current work's. The prior results were interpreted in terms of the hippocampal coding of distinct geometric spatial reference frames. From a topological point of view it is not obvious why the lengthening/shrinking of the linear environment as in previous work, is an important difference from the kinking of the environment in the present environment. Consider also the work with hairpin mazes such as Derdikman et al (2009) and open fields such as Gothard et al (J Neurosci 1996b). Importantly, in previous work it was found that place cells did not represent geometric space in a simple manner. The prior results resemble the data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B and E,F</a>. These observations were interpreted as the rat representing space in different spatial frames, where the origin of one frame is the initiation of a run and the origin of the other frame is the end of the run, but both being geometric representations. Why is this not a parsimonious and equally accurate explanation for the present data?"

Note that, in previous cases where hippocampal neurons shrink or expand to distortions of the environment, systematic variations in those distortions were a major parameter of the task design, whereas more categorical responses (re-mapping) is observed when environments and task parameters are discontinuously changed (as in their track B)."

We now include this more explicit definition in the Introduction. These qualitative relations stand in contrast to metrical (geometric), quantitative features such as distances, angles, and shapes. An analogy that makes the distinction easier to remember is that a geometric or Cartesian coordinate map is akin to a to-scale street map, whereas a topological map is akin to a subway map, which doesn\u2019t have to be to scale to be useful; it simply has to tell you which lines connect with which at which stations, how many stops there are until you need to get out, and so forth. It can be very much not to scale but still be perfectly functional. Geometry is much less forgiving of approximation, as the frustrations of inaccurate street maps make perfectly clear."

We view such temporal sequence templates as a manifestation of the hippocampus\u2019 need for rough, rapid conceptualization of spatial environments for purposes of navigating to feeding sites, nests, foraging, etc., in environments that can change appearance a great deal over the course of days and seasons (and would thus be not only computationally costly but wasteful to map out in precise geometric detail according to visual cues that could be covered in snow or erupt in riotous bloom overnight)."

A) Three place fields (red, green and blue) stretch following the enlargement of the enclosure. To the right we show how the overlap between the place fields reflects the pattern of temporal overlap between the place cell\u2019s spike trains; the rate of coactivity events depends on the distance between the place field centers, \u0394<sub>ij</sub> = r<sub>i</sub> \u2212 r<sub>j</sub>, where ri is the distance of the i<sup>th</sup> place field from the track\u2019s center, their widths and the spiking rate amplitudes. B) After the environment expands over the distance D, the place fields\u2019 layout stretches and the fields\u2019 centers shift proportionally to their distances from the walls of the enclosure (<a href=\"#bib20\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2008</a>; Gothard et al., 1996). According to (<a href=\"#bib65\">O'Keefe and Burgess, 1996</a>), some place fields may even remain at a fixed distance from the walls of the enclosure. In either case, the change in the distance between the place field centers is small. For example, consider two place fields on a 1-meter-long track located at r<sub>1</sub> = 50 cm and r<sub>2</sub> =60 cm, respectively. After the track stretches over D =100 cm, the place fields will move to r\u2032<sub>1</sub> = 100 cm and r\u2032<sub>2</sub> = 120 cm. As a result, if the original distance between place fields was \u0394<sub>12</sub> = 10 cm, after the stretch it will be \u0394\u2032<sub>12</sub> =20 cm. The increase in distance between place field centers is thus only \u03b5<sub>12</sub> =10 cm, or 10% of the full stretch. Since place cell activity is modulated by an animal\u2019s speed, visual cues, odor, and a plethora of other factors, a particular readout neuron would have no way of determining whether the change in firing rate is due to a geometric determinant, the animal slowing down, a change in a visual cue, or something else. Thus, even if the place field layout stretches significantly, the corresponding geometrical information would not necessarily be captured by the downstream networks unless the change is quite large."

The apparent complexities of place cell behavior anchored in different frames of reference in previous experiments come at least in part from the seeming lack of awareness that there are any qualities of space other than geometric ones. In other words, many authors have never considered a topological alternative, so their interpretations of their data do not argue for geometry vs. topology, but simply assume geometry and interpret accordingly. The language used to describe certain results is thus very confusing if one actually realizes there are at least these two aspects of space. In the Gothard et al. paper (J Neurosci 1996b), for example, the Discussion has this passage: \u201cThus, the metric for the location representation appears not to derive from the perception of spatial relationships, such as the geometry of the environment, visual angles, and retinal image sizes of landmarks, but rather from self-motion cues.\u201d From our perspective, it is misleading to equate \u201cspatial relationships\u201d with the geometry of the environment; we would say there are quantitative (geometric) and qualitative (topological) relationships. With that caveat, however, and within the framework of their assumptions, their conclusion is completely reasonable and consistent with our findings: the animals are not representing location through abstract visual representations of the geometry of the environment but from what Gothard et al. interpret as \u201cself-motion cues\u201d and what we interpret as a topological experiential framework."
