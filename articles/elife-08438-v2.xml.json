This clock is comprised of a population of coordinated oscillating cells that together produce rhythmic gene expression patterns in the embryo. Whether individual cells autonomously maintain oscillations, or whether oscillations depend on signals from neighboring cells is unknown. Using a transgenic zebrafish reporter line for the cyclic transcription factor Her1, we recorded single tailbud cells in vitro. We demonstrate that individual cells can behave as autonomous cellular oscillators. We described the observed variability in cell behavior using a theory of generic oscillators with correlated noise. Single cells have longer periods and lower precision than the tissue, highlighting the role of collective processes in the segmentation clock. Our work reveals a population of cells from the zebrafish segmentation clock that behave as self-sustained, autonomous oscillators with distinctive noisy dynamics."

This clock is comprised of a population of coordinated oscillating cells that together produce rhythmic gene expression patterns in the embryo. Whether individual cells autonomously maintain oscillations, or whether oscillations depend on signals from neighboring cells is unknown. Using a transgenic zebrafish reporter line for the cyclic transcription factor Her1, we recorded single tailbud cells in vitro. We demonstrate that individual cells can behave as autonomous cellular oscillators. We described the observed variability in cell behavior using a theory of generic oscillators with correlated noise. Single cells have longer periods and lower precision than the tissue, highlighting the role of collective processes in the segmentation clock. Our work reveals a population of cells from the zebrafish segmentation clock that behave as self-sustained, autonomous oscillators with distinctive noisy dynamics."

These oscillations generate a rhythmic spatial pattern. This \u201csegmentation clock\u201d is thought to subdivide the embryonic body into morphological segments, called somites, which arise rhythmically and sequentially from the PSM. Persistent oscillating gene expression within the tailbud and PSM corresponds to segment formation in chick, mouse, and zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib46\">Palmeirim et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dequ\u00e9ant et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Krol et al., 2011</a>). Looking across biological systems, persistent and coherent rhythms in a population can be the product of synchronized cell-autonomous oscillators, or alternatively can be the outcome of population-level coupling of otherwise non-oscillatory cells. The autonomy of circadian clock neurons was demonstrated by recording daily oscillations in firing rate and gene expression from single cells for several cycles in the absence of their neighbors (<a href=\"#bib65\">Welsh et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Webb et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, some microbial systems have been shown to produce oscillations only when at critical densities that allowed cell-to-cell communication, otherwise the isolated cells were not rhythmic (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gregor et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Danino et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, to test for autonomy of cellular oscillators in the segmentation clock, it is imperative to determine whether individual cells can oscillate in the absence of signals from their neighbors."

This means the PSM is autonomous at the tissue level. The question of whether individual segmentation clock cells are able to oscillate autonomously, that is, when fully separated from the tissue, has been debated for decades. Early theoretical arguments explored this possibility (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cooke and Zeeman, 1976</a>), as well as scenarios where coupling led to oscillations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Meinhardt, 1986</a>). The possibility for an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop arising from the transcription and translation of members of the Hes/Her gene family would be consistent with a cell-autonomous mechanism (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hirata et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lewis, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Monk, 2003</a>), and oscillations in this gene family have been observed across vertebrate species (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krol et al., 2011</a>). However, the discovery of oscillations in the Delta-Notch system in all vertebrates and in many genes of the Wnt and FGF intercellular signaling pathways in mouse and chick, raises the possibility that communication between cells may play a critical role in the generation and/or maintenance of the oscillations (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dequ\u00e9ant et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Krol et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goldbeter and Pourqui\u00e9, 2008</a>)."

In the first study, cells isolated from chick PSM, then cultured in suspension and fixed at subsequent time intervals, showed changes in cyclic gene expression (<a href=\"#bib33\">Maroto et al., 2005</a>). Due to the unavoidable uncertainty in reconstructing a time series from static snapshots of different cells, the authors of this study were not able to distinguish between noisy autonomous oscillators and stochastic patterns of gene expression, and highlighted the need for real-time reporters to investigate the autonomy of PSM cells. In the second study, the first real-time reporter of the segmentation clock, a luciferase reporter of Hes1\u2009expression in mouse, allowed individual mouse PSM cells to be observed in vitro (<a href=\"#bib36\">Masamizu et al., 2006</a>). Three cells were reported, showing at most 4\u2009expression pulses with variable duration and amplitude, which appeared to damp out. This study concluded that PSM cells may be \u201cunstable\u201d oscillators, and highlighted the role of intercellular coupling for maintenance of oscillations. Reflecting this, the authors modeled the cells as excitable systems dependent on noise or signals from their neighbors for pulse generation. Thus, the degree of autonomy of completely isolated cells from the segmentation clock in mouse and chick remains unclear."

More recent results bring support to the idea of autonomous oscillators that are synchronized to each other. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor targeting the Notch intercellular domain (DAPT) leads to a loss of spatial coherence in oscillating gene expression (<a href=\"#bib48\">Riedel-Kruse et al., 2007</a>). Additionally, imaging of individual cells in mutant embryos with reduced Notch signaling show that oscillations persist under these conditions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Delaune et al., 2012</a>), though this does not rule out the possibility of Notch or other signaling factors playing a role in promoting oscillations. We recently developed an in vitro primary culture system to image gene expression in individual tailbud and PSM cells (<a href=\"#bib64\">Webb et al., 2014</a>), allowing the possibility of autonomous oscillations to be tested directly."

Theoretical analysis of the collective behavior of many cellular oscillators with time-delayed coupling shows that this process can set a collective period in a synchronized population (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herrgen et al., 2010</a>). This predicts that cells isolated from the tailbud will have a different period than the population. In addition, the precision of oscillation in a synchronized population can be higher than that of component oscillators (<a href=\"#bib18\">Herzog et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Garcia-Ojalvo et al., 2004</a>), and this scenario has been proposed for the segmentation clock (<a href=\"#bib36\">Masamizu et al., 2006</a>). However, an alternative case of synchronized oscillators with the same individual precision as the population has also been considered for the segmentation clock (<a href=\"#bib22\">Horikawa et al., 2006</a>). Knowledge of the period and precision of cells isolated from the segmentation clock should enable tests of these ideas."

In this description, the amplitude of oscillations grows with the square of the distance to the bifurcation.

Slow fluctuations in gene expression and signaling systems have been reported in a variety of systems (<a href=\"#bib58\">S\u00fcel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sigal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Albeck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2013</a>). We introduced slow fluctuations in the parameter <i>\u03bc</i> that controls the amplitude of oscillators in the theory. Motivated by the lack of correlation between period and amplitude in the data (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013I</a>), we set the coupling between these processes to zero. Slow amplitude fluctuations can drive the oscillators in and out of the oscillatory state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and introduce correlations in the amplitude of consecutive cycles that are comparable to the experimental data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Interestingly, the trend to higher amplitude variance at higher amplitude values, and the existence of a low occurrence of high relative amplitude cycles are not captured by the theory. To describe period fluctuations and their weak correlation observed in the data we introduced an additive white noise in the variables of the oscillator (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,G</a>) (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

In contrast to these effects, changing the variance of the additive white noise did not affect the distribution of amplitudes, the correlations of amplitudes, or the fraction of the oscillating time (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We used a wavelet transform to extract the phase of oscillatory signals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We then evaluated precision by means of the quality factor <i>Q</i>, defined as the ratio of the decay time of the autocorrelation function and the period of oscillations (<a href=\"#bib42\">Morelli and J\u00fclicher, 2007</a>). All time series were sampled using time windows of equivalent lengths (6.5\u2009cycles) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); this procedure and the observed distribution of Q values are described in <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. We found that persistent cells had a mean period of 78.3\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, inset). This is consistent with the period inferred from the inter-peak intervals measured from the entire low-density data set. We calculated a median quality factor <i>Q<sub>P</sub></i> ~4\u2009from the persistent cells\u2019 oscillations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Our analysis excluded dividing cells, and as cell division is thought to introduce phase noise in the time series (<a href=\"#bib8\">Delaune et al., 2012</a>), the precision of dividing cells would be lower."

A comparable increase in period was not reported with explanted mouse tailbuds (<a href=\"#bib36\">Masamizu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lauschke et al., 2012</a>). However, a general developmental slowing of explanted zebrafish tissue has been previously reported (<a href=\"#bib29\">Langenberg et al., 2003</a>). The reason for this is unknown, and likely involves chemical or mechanical differences in culture compared to the embryo. Recent studies of embryonic cell shape and migration have successfully utilized in vitro assays over minutes to tens-of-minutes time scales (<a href=\"#bib10\">Diz-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ma\u00eetre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ruprecht et al., 2015</a>), but the dynamics of longer-term zebrafish primary cell culture remains relatively unexplored (<a href=\"#bib66\">Westerfield, 2000</a>). The differentiation of several lineages in primary cell culture appears to be slowed compared to the embryo, although this has not prevented the identification of relevant molecular regulatory mechanisms in this context (<a href=\"#bib68\">Xu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). The zebrafish segmentation clock can maintain stable oscillatory output over a three-fold change in frequency due to temperature differences (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schr\u00f6ter et al., 2008</a>), suggesting that its mechanism is robust to alterations in global growth conditions. Nevertheless, until the mechanism of this general slowing in vitro and its influence on the molecular and cellular processes within the segmentation clock are understood, we must remain circumspect in our interpretations."

This supports the expectation that coupling with time delays between segmentation clock cells in the zebrafish leads to a decrease in the period of the synchronized population (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herrgen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Morelli et al., 2009</a>). However, the magnitude of the difference is larger than anticipated from the segmentation period of intact embryos with reduced Delta-Notch signaling, where the effect of delayed coupling was estimated at 20% (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herrgen et al., 2010</a>). This difference may be due to additional, as yet unknown coupling pathways in the tissue, and/or to the existence of signals in the tissue that alter the base period with which the cell can tick, and which are diluted by the low-density culture. Our own observations with a range of Fgf8b concentrations indicate that it does not affect period (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8D</a>, and data not shown), suggesting that Fgf signaling is unlikely to be responsible. In this assay, rather than being instructive for the period of oscillations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ishimatsu et al., 2010</a>), Fgf appears to be permissive for the oscillatory state (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dubrulle et al., 2001</a>)."

We propose that this heterogeneity can be described as the trajectories of self-sustained oscillators in the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation. In this scenario, excursions across the bifurcation stop and start cycling behavior, but the underlying oscillatory mechanism remains. Fgf signalling appears to push the oscillators above this bifurcation, and the characteristic longer-timescales in the amplitude noise that we have observed may come from the inherent dynamics of the Erk network downstream of the Fgf receptor (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Albeck et al., 2013</a>). One feature of oscillators in the vicinity of a bifurcation is that they may be more readily synchronized by coupling (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gonze et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barral et al., 2010</a>). Individual cells from the mouse segmentation clock are also noisy, but the contribution of cell-cell signaling to maintenance of oscillations, either by contact or through diffusible factors, remains unclear (<a href=\"#bib36\">Masamizu et al., 2006</a>). It is possible that in the mouse intercellular signaling may be required for sustaining oscillations, as has been observed for Delta-Notch signaling in neural progenitors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Imayoshi et al., 2013</a>). Striking the optimal balance between autonomous and collectively-maintained oscillations could be a tune-able evolutionary strategy in developing multi-cellular systems. The relationship between cell intrinsic circuits, local cell communication and tissue-level patterns will be important for understanding development, as well as engineering strategies for synthetic cellular systems (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sprinzak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Matsuda et al., 2015</a>)."

The remaining cells (34%) were tracked in transmitted light images using a region of interest (ROI) tool in Fiji (ImageJ, NIH). Average and maximum intensities across the ROI were then measured and interpolated across images with a customized plug-in (ROI interpolator [<a href=\"#bib55\">Soroldoni et al., 2014</a>)]). Before peak detection, any low frequency trends in the baseline of these raw intensity traces were removed by subtracting a local background obtained by measuring signal next to each cell (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

Although the study uses a larger number of cells than in previous work on similar systems, it was felt that the main findings are unsurprising and largely confirm those of earlier studies. It was also felt that, should a link to in vivo data be made (as suggested by Reviewer 3), this was also likely to confirm work that has already been done, and so would be unlikely to add further understanding.

This question has been tackled before in other species (chick, mouse), although in these previous studies, a very few dissociated cells were studied as part of a cell suspension (Masamizu et al.) or were pooled for analysis (Maroto et al.). The current study provides an advance over these previous studies, as the authors have examined much larger numbers of dissociated cells within a low density suspension than in previous studies, enabling a much more thorough quantitative and statistical analysis of the data. The authors also examine a small number of cells that have been isolated completely, and show (for a small number of cells) that oscillations can occur autonomously under these conditions."

My primary concern here is that the Her1 expression observed in the low-density cultured cells is so distinct to that observed in tailbud cells in an intact embryo. The period of oscillation in vivo is 27min; the mean period extracted from the time-courses of the cultured cells is around three times as long as this (ca. 78min). The two sets of oscillations thus represent markedly different dynamics. The long-period noisy oscillations observed in cultured cells may (or may not) be due to a dynamical system close to a Hopf bifurcation, but if they are, it is hard to see how this relates to a dynamical system based on the same components oscillating in a tissue with almost three times the frequency! The key observation in this regard is that the somitogenesis period in explanted PSM is around 55min, rather than the 27min in the embryo at the same temperature. This is reported in this manuscript without any real discussion. But surely this is a striking and potentially important result."

The authors use this finding to focus their attention on a S-L model with q=0 (so, the frequency is independent of the amplitude). This restricts the type of supercritical Hopf bifurcation that could underlie the observed oscillations (the normal form does not require q=0). Does this restrict the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the observed Her1 oscillations? In particular, do noisy negative feedback oscillators behave in this way? It is my understanding that stochastic simulations of negative feedback circuits (like the ones alluded to by the authors) that exhibit sub-Hopf stochastic resonance do show amplitude-dependence of the period (increased amplitude leads to increased period). Furthermore, the authors have previously shown that the use of the Her1-Venus transgene increases the period of oscillations. Is this likely to be due to the overall increase in expression level of Her1 in the Looping line? The amplitude-dependence of period (or lack of it) is potentially important for the tissue-wide oscillations observed in the PSM, as the value and distribution of q is an important factor in the ability of oscillators to synchronise."

For example, after the division at 00.30, the daughter on the left of the pair has a very clear YFP peak at 00.39-00.40, while its sister on the right has very low YFP signal at the same time point.

So it is fair to say that the cells are oscillators. However, I remain to be convinced that these facts are sufficient to call the cells \"single zebrafish segmentation clock cells\" (e.g. sixth paragraph of the Introduction and many other places). The segmentation clock is surely a coordinated tissue-wide oscillatory operating in the tailbud/PSM. A parsimonious (though not necessary) explanation of the findings reported is that the segmentation clock results from the interaction of some noisy cell-autonomous genetic oscillators. But that is not sufficient to call the oscillations in the single cells in vitro a \"segmentation clock\"."

This question has been tackled before in other species (chick, mouse), although in these previous studies, a very few dissociated cells were studied as part of a cell suspension (Masamizu et al.) or were pooled for analysis (Maroto et al.). The current study provides an advance over these previous studies, as the authors have examined much larger numbers of dissociated cells within a low density suspension than in previous studies, enabling a much more thorough quantitative and statistical analysis of the data. The authors also examine a small number of cells that have been isolated completely, and show (for a small number of cells) that oscillations can occur autonomously under these conditions.</i> "

Although these pioneering papers have been cited in the primary and review literature as containing evidence for autonomous oscillators in the mouse or in the chick, in fact, neither of these papers provides direct evidence. Indeed, the authors of the papers have carefully refrained from making any conclusions about this aspect, and based on the evidence in these papers, one could just as easily conclude that cells from the chick and mouse segmentation clock cannot autonomously sustain oscillations. We argue that this is a non-trivial problem with the literature. The idea that segmentation clock cells are autonomous has been widely assumed for the purposes of theoretical modeling; this assumption was first explicitly stated in 2003 in three papers, two years before Maroto and three before Masamizu:"

Since Ntl and Tbx16 expression is lost as cells move into the anterior PSM, this finding argues that many of the cells in culture have maintained a relatively posterior progenitor state. The dissection of the tailbud posterior to the end of the notochord (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) is expected to recover cells of the neural plate, skin, endoderm and lateral plate mesoderm, in addition to cells of the PSM.

Tailbud cells in our culture oscillate without Fgf8b, also with a range of oscillatory phenotypes, but with many fewer peaks on average. These peaks tend to occur at the beginning of the recording, and in most cases appear to damp out. To document this, we have added to the revised version traces from 52 cells from the same starting tailbud cell suspensions as reported in the manuscript (experiments 240711 and 250112), but recorded in a separate well of the divided dish without added Fgf8b. Peak counting analysis of these traces found a median of 2 peaks, in agreement with our previously published work defining the basic isolation and culture protocol (Webb et al., J Vis Exp (89) 2014), compared to a median of 5 peaks for Fgf8b-treated cells (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Although period estimates for the serum only cells are slightly noisier because of the fewer cycles, they are similar to those of cells treated with Fgf8b. This phenotype is consistent with the proposed role of FGF in the vertebrate tailbud as a factor that retains cells in a progenitor state (Dubrulle, J. et al., (2001). Cell, 106(2), 219\u2013232.; Diez del Corral, R. et al., (2002). Development 129, 1681\u2013 1691).

These show a high degree of variability, and a range of analyses are performed to extract phase and amplitude data. The authors go on to compare these summary measures to those obtained from a generic model of a system close to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation (at the boundary between decaying and sustained oscillations). They show that reasonable (though not perfect) agreement between the two sets of measures (experimental and simulated) can be achieved for an appropriate set of model parameters. These results are interesting in their own right, as a careful investigation of the nature of the time-courses obtained from the cultured tailbud cells. I'm less convinced that they say anything particularly important about somitogenesis in zebrafish. My primary concern here is that the Her1 expression observed in the low-density cultured cells is so distinct to that observed in tailbud cells in an intact embryo. The period of oscillation in vivo is 27min; the mean period extracted from the time-courses of the cultured cells is around three times as long as this (ca. 78min). The two sets of oscillations thus represent markedly different dynamics. The long-period noisy oscillations observed in cultured cells may (or may not) be due to a dynamical system close to a Hopf bifurcation, but if they are, it is hard to see how this relates to a dynamical system based on the same components oscillating in a tissue with almost three times the frequency! The key observation in this regard is that the somitogenesis period in explanted PSM is around 55min, rather than the 27min in the embryo at the same temperature. This is reported in this manuscript without any real discussion. But surely this is a striking and potentially important result. My overall assessment is that the data set and data analysis are high quality and worthy of publication. The potential fit to a very generic model is also interesting, but I'm not convinced that the fit is actually that good. Given the large discrepancy between the cultures and the embryo, I'm not convinced that the data have much to say about somitogenesis.</i> "

Dyn. 228, 464\u2013474 (2003)), we needed a more direct measure of this slowing to get a better comparison of the differences between the genetic oscillations in the tissue and single cell. We have therefore now added a new experiment in which we estimate period directly from the YFP signal in explanted Looping1 tailbuds (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014 source data 1</a>). We found a period of 42 minutes in the explant, which is about 1.5 times the longer than the period of segmentation in the intact embryo. When cells are dispersed from the tailbud explants in culture, the period lengthens approximately 2-fold (regardless of the presence of FGF). We argue this is a direct measurement of the difference between tissue-level and single cell oscillations in culture. An increase in period after dissociation was expected but its magnitude was not, so these new experiments provoked by the reviewers\u2019 critiques may have revealed a new phenomenon. We speculate that this difference might be due to an as yet unknown additional source of coupling in the tissue, and/or a tonically-expressed factor in the tailbud that elevates the frequency in the tissue, but is diluted once the cells are dispersed. Please also see the detailed response to reviewer 1, substantive concern 1, above. Thus, the revised manuscript removes the lengthy and somewhat abstract comparisons of estimates in the Results, replacing them with measurements at the beginning of the Results, and a discussion of the differences at the end."

Whatever the changes to the biochemistry, these end up in the parameter omega for the frequency in the model. The model is used primarily to probe the noise in the data and doesn\u2019t describe the changes in time-scale.

On this basis, we wouldn\u2019t have expected that reducing cell division would affect the cells ability to oscillate per se. In any case, we have checked Tbx16 and Ntl expression in the cells of parallel cultures (as above) and found that expression is consistent with the tailbud.

This restricts the type of supercritical Hopf bifurcation that could underlie the observed oscillations (the normal form does not require q=0). Does this restrict the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the observed Her1 oscillations? In particular, do noisy negative feedback oscillators behave in this way? It is my understanding that stochastic simulations of negative feedback circuits (like the ones alluded to by the authors) that exhibit sub-Hopf stochastic resonance do show amplitude-dependence of the period (increased amplitude leads to increased period). Furthermore, the authors have previously shown that the use of the Her1-Venus transgene increases the period of oscillations. Is this likely to be due to the overall increase in expression level of Her1 in the Looping line? The amplitude-dependence of period (or lack of it) is potentially important for the tissue-wide oscillations observed in the PSM, as the value and distribution of q is an important factor in the ability of oscillators to synchronise.</i> "

I find this very surprising, given the source data file (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>), which documents only 9 instances of cell division in the entire dataset from a total of 29 fields of view, which would suggest that cell division events are rare. The observation of five division events in a single field of view also suggests that <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> is not representative of the dataset as a whole, and is directly contradictory to the statements in the rebuttal that 'it seems that culture conditions are inhibiting division'; 'because of the very low rate of cell division in the culture' etc. In short, I am not confident that the authors have measured the rate of cell division accurately in their cultures. Further explanation is required here.</i> "

As far as I can see, there does not appear to be a consistent timing of division relative to the phase of the oscillation between the three examples, or maintenance of synchrony between daughters within a pair, although oscillation in at least one daughter can clearly continue after division. For example, after the division at 00.30, the daughter on the left of the pair has a very clear YFP peak at 00.39-00.40, while its sister on the right has very low YFP signal at the same time point. Since the dataset captures this very interesting information, it deserves some comment, even if a full analysis is beyond the scope of the current study.</i> "

The authors have addressed my queries and concerns. The additional data, and provision of raw data, make it easier to assess the validity of the statements made in the manuscript. I have one remaining niggle with the conclusions drawn from the data and the corresponding nomenclature employed by the authors. The cells are derived from the tailbud and maintain tailbud markers (new data). The cells certainly exhibit oscillations, which have features that are consistent with an underlying dynamical system that is close to a Hopf bifurcation. So it is fair to say that the cells are oscillators. However, I remain to be convinced that these facts are sufficient to call the cells \"single zebrafish segmentation clock cells\" (e.g. sixth paragraph of the Introduction and many other places). The segmentation clock is surely a coordinated tissue-wide oscillatory operating in the tailbud/PSM. A parsimonious (though not necessary) explanation of the findings reported is that the segmentation clock results from the interaction of some noisy cell-autonomous genetic oscillators. But that is not sufficient to call the oscillations in the single cells in vitro a \"segmentation clock\". I accept the argument that the period of the in vitro segmentation clock can exhibit marked temperature-dependence. But that does not lessen the difficulty of arguing that if a cell-autonomous oscillation in tailbud-derived cells is borderline-Hopf with a period of ca. 80min, then the in vivo clock, with a period of ca. 27min, has something to do with borderline-Hopf dynamics. I maintain that I do not think it is easy to explain how an oscillatory mechanism can be close to a Hopf bifurcation at two radically different periods. It may be that the mechanisms underlying the observed in vitro cell-autonomous oscillations and the in vivo segmentation clock are closely related (and it is probably true), but that does not mean that their dynamics are similar. Just because cells can oscillate in two different conditions does not mean that one can say that the oscillations are two different versions of the same thing. In summary, I like this study. I think the in vitro oscillations are interesting and the analysis is powerful. I just don't like the idea of calling these oscillations a segmentation clock</i> \u2013"
