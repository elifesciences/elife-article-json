The function of Lrp4 in the brain, however, is unknown, as <i>Lrp4</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice fail to form neuromuscular synapses and die at birth. <i>Lrp4</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, rescued for Lrp4 expression selectively in muscle, survive into adulthood and showed profound deficits in cognitive tasks that assess learning and memory. To learn whether synapses form and function aberrantly, we used electrophysiological and anatomical methods to study hippocampal CA3\u2013CA1 synapses. In the absence of Lrp4, the organization of the hippocampus appeared normal, but the frequency of spontaneous release events and spine density on primary apical dendrites were reduced. CA3 input was unable to adequately depolarize CA1 neurons to induce long-term potentiation. Our studies demonstrate a role for Lrp4 in hippocampal function and suggest that patients with mutations in <i>Lrp4</i> or auto-antibodies to Lrp4 should be evaluated for neurological deficits."

Lrp4 plays a key role in the formation and maintenance of neuromuscular synapses, as a loss of Lrp4 leads to a failure to form neuromuscular synapses, and mutations in <i>Lrp4</i> or auto-antibodies to Lrp4 cause congenital myasthenia and myasthenia gravis, respectively (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ohkawara et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tsivgoulis et al., 2014</a>). Lrp4 functions bidirectionally at neuromuscular synapses, where it responds to neuronal Agrin, stimulating MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that functions as a master regulator of synapse formation, and functions in a retrograde manner to stimulate differentiation of motor nerve terminals (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yumoto et al., 2012</a>)."

Within the CNS, Lrp4 is expressed prominently in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and neocortex and present in postsynaptic membranes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tian et al., 2006</a>). The role of Lrp4 in the CNS is not understood, as <i>Lrp4</i> mutant mice die at birth from neuromuscular and respiratory failure, before synapse formation in the CNS ensues (<a href=\"#bib6\">De Felipe et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tian et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Weatherbee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yumoto et al., 2012</a>). Previously, we generated mice that lack Lrp4 in all tissues except skeletal muscle and found that muscle-selective expression of Lrp4 (<i>Lrp4</i><sup><i>m</i></sup><i>)</i> rescued the neuromuscular deficits of <i>Lrp4</i> mutant mice, allowing the mice to survive as adults (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gomez and Burden, 2011</a>). To learn whether Lrp4 plays a role in the CNS, we used multiple behavioral paradigms to study the behavior of these muscle-rescued mice. Next, we examined the synaptic transmission and the anatomical organization of inputs onto CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Our data show that the rescued mice perform poorly in several learning and memory paradigms, demonstrating that Lrp4 has a critical role in the CNS. Moreover, we show that Lrp4 is enriched in postsynaptic membranes from the hippocampus, and our electrophysiological studies demonstrate a dramatic loss in long-term potentiation (LTP), accompanied by a reduction in synapses on apical dendrites of CA1 neurons."

Induction of LTP in CA1 neurons requires that SC-released glutamate binds to AMPA receptors to depolarize postsynaptic neurons to a level sufficient to release the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-block of NMDA receptors and drive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into postsynaptic compartments (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nowak et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Collingridge et al., 1988</a>). To determine whether CA3 Schaeffer collaterals are unable to adequately depolarize CA1 neurons during TBS, we paired repetitive TBS with direct postsynaptic depolarization to 0 mV during LTP induction. We found that this brief period of depolarization of CA1 neurons was sufficient to restore normal TBS-induced LTP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J,K,M,N</a>). Importantly, these data show that expression of LTP in <i>Lrp4</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> CA1 neurons is intact as long as CA1 neurons are adequately depolarized during TBS. Thus, CA3 SCs appear unable to depolarize CA1 neurons to a level required to recruit NMDA receptors.

Specifically, our results indicate that defects in synaptic transmission and postsynaptic integration may contribute to deficits in long-term plasticity, learning, and memory. Stimulation of CA3 inputs fails to induce LTP in <i>Lrp4</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CA1 neurons. Importantly, direct depolarization of <i>Lrp4</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CA1 neurons during TBS can rescue LTP. Thus, CA3\u2013CA1 synapses in <i>Lrp4</i> mutant neurons have the capacity to express LTP. Because direct stimulation by-passes the normal synaptic mechanisms for depolarizing CA1 neurons, the absence of LTP in <i>Lrp4</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CA1 neurons may be due to a failure of SC inputs to adequately depolarize CA1 neurons and remove the Mg<sup>++</sup>-dependent block of NMDA receptors. The reduction in the number of CA3\u2013CA1 synapses on apical dendrites is consistent with this view."

Further studies will be required to learn whether Lrp4 is required for neurogenesis, early steps in synapse formation, later stages in synaptic differentiation, and the construction and function of Lrp4-dependent circuits that are important for cognition. It seems likely that the loss of neuronal Lrp4 is responsible for the changes in cognition and synaptic function described here. Consistent with this idea, <i>Lrp4</i> is strongly expressed in the dentate gyrus and CA fields of the hippocampus, as well as in the olfactory bulb, and cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tian et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lein et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, Lrp4 co-fractionates with the postsynaptic density (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tian et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Further, Lrp4 is expressed on the cell surface of cultured cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tian et al., 2006</a>). Nonetheless, it may also be the case that other cell types, including glia, may express Lrp4 and contribute to the cognitive deficits found in muscle-rescued <i>Lrp4</i> mutant mice. Because glia are known to regulate the efficiency of synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib8\">Eroglu and Barres, 2010</a>), a potential defect in glia\u2013neuron signaling could contribute to a failure of synaptic transmission, postsynaptic integration, and/or synapse formation on CA1 apical dendrites."

Ann NY Acad Sci doi: 10.1111/nyas.12553, Epub ahead of print). For example, Dalmau\u2019s studies have shown that autoimmune encephalitis can arise from production of antibodies to a variety of neuronal cell surface proteins, including the NMDA receptor, LG1 and Caspr2 (Armangue et al. 2014 Autoimmune encephalitis as differential diagnosis of infectious encephalitis.

Although IgG levels are normally 100 to 200-fold lower in the CSF than in the blood, it seems likely that the low level of antibody that normally crosses the BBB and enters the CSF can initiate a response, possibly triggering a further breakdown in the BBB (Graus et al.
