High-level protection in humans can be achieved by experimental immunization with <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> sporozoites attenuated by radiation or under anti-malarial drug coverage. Immunization with genetically attenuated parasites (GAP) would be an attractive alternative approach. Here we present data on safety and protective efficacy using sporozoites with deletions of two genes i.e. the newly identified <i>b9</i> and <i>slarp</i>, which govern independent and critical processes for successful liver-stage development. In the rodent malaria model, Pb\u0394<i>b9</i>\u0394<i>slarp</i>GAP was completely attenuated showing no breakthrough infections while efficiently inducing high level protection. The human Pf\u0394<i>b9</i>\u0394<i>slarp</i>GAP generated without drug-resistance markers were infective to human hepatocytes in vitro and to humanized mice engrafted with human hepatocytes in vivo but completely aborted development after infection. These findings support the clinical development of a Pf\u0394<i>b9</i>\u0394<i>slarp</i>SPZ vaccine."
