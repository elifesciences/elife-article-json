Recent data have demonstrated that ER\u2013mitochondria contacts mark mitochondrial division sites, but the molecular basis and functions of these contacts are not understood. Here we show that in yeast, the ER\u2013mitochondria tethering complex, ERMES, and the highly conserved Miro GTPase, Gem1, are spatially and functionally linked to ER-associated mitochondrial division. Gem1 acts as a negative regulator of ER\u2013mitochondria contacts, an activity required for the spatial resolution and distribution of newly generated mitochondrial tips following division. Previous data have demonstrated that ERMES localizes with a subset of actively replicating mitochondrial nucleoids. We show that mitochondrial division is spatially linked to nucleoids and that a majority of these nucleoids segregate prior to division, resulting in their distribution into newly generated tips in the mitochondrial network. Thus, we postulate that ER-associated division serves to link the distribution of mitochondria and mitochondrial nucleoids in cells."

Recent data have demonstrated that ER\u2013mitochondria contacts mark mitochondrial division sites, but the molecular basis and functions of these contacts are not understood. Here we show that in yeast, the ER\u2013mitochondria tethering complex, ERMES, and the highly conserved Miro GTPase, Gem1, are spatially and functionally linked to ER-associated mitochondrial division. Gem1 acts as a negative regulator of ER\u2013mitochondria contacts, an activity required for the spatial resolution and distribution of newly generated mitochondrial tips following division. Previous data have demonstrated that ERMES localizes with a subset of actively replicating mitochondrial nucleoids. We show that mitochondrial division is spatially linked to nucleoids and that a majority of these nucleoids segregate prior to division, resulting in their distribution into newly generated tips in the mitochondrial network. Thus, we postulate that ER-associated division serves to link the distribution of mitochondria and mitochondrial nucleoids in cells."

Dnm1 and Drp1 form helices in vitro, whose diameters are significantly smaller than the diameter of unconstricted mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ingerman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bossy et al., 2010</a>).

Consistent with this model, the association of ER tubules with mitochondrial constriction sites is independent of mitochondrial division components (<a href=\"#bib11\">Friedman et al., 2011</a>).

The ERMES complex is composed of four core subunits, each of which is required for the formation of multiple ERMES foci per cell: Mdm10 and Mdm34 are integral to the mitochondrial outer membrane; Mdm12 is predicted to be cytosolic; and Mmm1 is an ER transmembrane protein (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kornmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Stroud et al., 2011</a>). ERMES is thought to function as a physical ER\u2013mitochondria tether that serves to distribute mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boldogh et al., 2003</a>) and to facilitate the exchange of lipids between the two organelles (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kornmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Voss et al., 2012</a>). ERMES foci are localized adjacent to a subset of nucleoids, which are engaged in replicating DNA (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hobbs et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hanekamp et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Meeusen and Nunnari, 2003</a>), suggesting that ERMES plays an active role in nucleoid regulation. In agreement with this notion, deletion of core ERMES components disrupts nucleoid structure and transforms the tubular mitochondrial network into spherical mitochondria with relatively large diameters (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burgess et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Youngman et al., 2004</a>). The ERMES-deficient mitochondrial morphology phenotype is epistatic to the characteristic net-like mitochondrial structures that result from the deletion of genes encoding mitochondrial division components (<a href=\"#bib54\">Youngman et al., 2004</a>), consistent with ERMES functioning upstream of the mitochondrial division machinery in mitochondrial distribution."

In yeast cells lacking Gem1, mitochondria form a distinct spectrum of abnormal structures, from tubules to clustered spheres, mitochondrial distribution into daughter cells is less efficient than that of wild-type mitochondria, and cells lose mitochondrial DNA at a significantly higher frequency (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frederick et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Koshiba et al., 2011</a>).

To this end, we expressed functional C-terminal GFP fusions of Mdm12, Mdm34, or Mmm1 from their respective endogenous loci and labeled mitochondria using mitochondrial matrix-targeted DsRed (mito-DsRed). We observed a majority of mitochondrial division events associated with Mdm12, Mdm34, or Mmm1-labeled ERMES foci, which subsequent to the division segregate to only one of the two newly generated tips in the mitochondrial network (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The fraction of division events associated with ERMES foci (54\u201360%) is significantly higher than that predicted for a random association (approximately 10%), based on the surface area of mitochondria associated with ERMES (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The detection of ERMES foci by fluorescence imaging may underestimate ERMES foci associated with mitochondrial division as we observed a positive correlation between the percentage of mitochondrial divisions associated with a given ERMES subunit and its estimated whole-cell abundance (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huh et al., 2003</a>).

Under our conditions, expression of Gem1 mutants harboring abrogating mutations in either EF-hand I or II motifs or both rescued all mitochondrial phenotypes in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells to a similar extent as wild-type <i>GEM1</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This observation is consistent with the published work demonstrating that the EF-hand regions play a relatively minor role in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and distribution, with only EF-hand I acting to stabilize Gem1 expression levels (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frederick et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Koshiba et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, expression of Gem1S19N or Gem1S462N, whose mutations abrogate the GTPase activity of GTPase domains 1 and 2, respectively, failed to fully rescue mitochondrial morphological phenotypes in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells. The Gem1S19N mutation was the least functional, consistent with previously published observations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frederick et al., 2004</a>). Abrogating mutations in the first GTPase domain, such as the Gem1S19N mutation, have been shown to reduce the steady-state localization of Gem1 to ERMES foci (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kornmann et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the severe phenotypes associated with Gem1S19N underscores the functional importance of Gem1\u2019s localization to ERMES foci. Significantly, we also observed stable ERMES-associated mitochondrial constrictions in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells expressing either Gem1S19N or Gem1S462N (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2D and 3A,B</a>). Thus, our structure function analysis of Gem1 indicates that similar features, specifically both Gem1 GTPase domains, are required for Gem1\u2019s roles in both the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and in the resolution of ERMES-marked mitochondrial constriction sites. Thus, the resolution of ERMES-associated mitochondrial constriction sites into segregated mitochondrial tips is a central function of Gem1."

We observed that stable mitochondrial constriction sites in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells (mito-TagBFP) were persistently associated with ER tubules (GFP-HDEL) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In addition, Dnm1 puncta localized to these ER-associated mitochondrial constriction sites in a dynamic manner similar to that observed in wild-type cells, associating and dissociating on a 10-s time scale (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frederick et al., 2004</a>). These observations indicate that neither ER engagement with nor Dnm1 recruitment to mitochondrial constriction sites is significantly altered in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells, suggesting that mitochondrial division per se is not defective. This conclusion is supported by the observation that in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells lacking Fzo1, an outer mitochondrial membrane dynamin-related protein required for mitochondrial fusion, mitochondria are fragmented, which is a morphology that requires mitochondrial division (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frederick et al., 2004</a>). Thus, taken together, these observations indicate that the stable ERMES-associated mitochondrial constriction sites in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells is a consequence of defective resolution of mitochondrial tips, perhaps as a consequence of altered ER\u2013mitochondria contacts."

The surface area of individual ER\u2013mitochondria contacts was, on average, smaller in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells as compared to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). However, the total ER\u2013mitochondria contact surface was approximately three times greater than that observed for wild-type mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). These findings are consistent with fluorescence data demonstrating that, in comparison to wild-type cells, ER tubules in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells were observed associated in a relatively stable manner with mitochondrial constriction sites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In addition, our EM analysis suggests that the reported larger ERMES foci observed by fluorescence imaging in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells may represent multiple unresolved ER\u2013mitochondria contacts (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kornmann et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The average diameter of <i>gem1</i>\u0394 mitochondria, measured along their short axis, was also greater than that of wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), consistent with our fluorescence imaging analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, the average diameter of ER-associated mitochondrial constriction sites in wild-type and <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells were similar (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), consistent with our light imaging data demonstrating that Dnm1 is still efficiently targeted to mitochondrial constriction sites in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Together, these data suggest that Gem1 functions downstream of ER-associated mitochondrial constriction and division as a negative regulator of ER\u2013mitochondria contacts, which is required for the efficient resolution and spatial distribution of mitochondria following division."

                        "text": "To further investigate the functional significance of these observations, we explored the idea that ERMD serves to position division sites adjacent to actively segregating mitochondrial nucleoids, which is based on the observation that ERMES is spatially linked to actively replicating mitochondrial nucleoids (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hobbs et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Meeusen and Nunnari, 2003</a>). To visualize nucleoids, we created a functional FP fusion to the nucleoid component, Yme2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>), an integral mitochondrial inner membrane protein with homology to exonucleases whose deletion alters nucleoid structure and copy number (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hanekamp and Thorsness, 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Park et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with the previously published work, we observed that over time a subset of Yme2-GFP\u2013labeled nucleoids persistently localize adjacent to ERMES foci, marked by Mdm34-tdTomato (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition, ERMES-linked nucleoids were associated with mitochondrial division events (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To characterize the behavior of yeast nucleoids at division sites, we simultaneously imaged mitochondria (mito-dsRed) and nucleoids (Yme2-GFP). Quantitative analysis indicated that mitochondrial nucleoids are associated with over 80% of mitochondrial division events (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Temporal analysis of Yme2-GFP\u2013labeled nucleoids positioned at future sites of mitochondrial division indicated that they exhibit short-ranged oscillatory movements and often rapidly segregate and recoalesce prior to mitochondrial division (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Following mitochondrial division, a majority of Yme2-GFP foci were observed at the ends of both newly generated mitochondrial tips (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). However, we also observed division events that resulted in a nucleoid in only one of the newly generated mitochondrial tips, indicating that division and nucleoid segregation are not obligatorily linked (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Consistent with a role of ERMES in nucleoid positioning, published data indicate that deletion of core ERMES components disrupts nucleoid structure (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burgess et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Youngman et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, we observed that nucleoids, as labeled by Yme2-GFP, maintained their discrete focal localization in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells, similar to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In addition, similar to ERMES distribution, Yme2-GFP foci were observed associated with stable mitochondrial constrictions in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), consistent with the idea that the spatial resolution of ER\u2013mitochondria contacts following division is fundamentally important for nucleoid distribution. Thus, our findings suggest that ERMD functions to position division sites in proximity to nucleoids to increase the probability of their distribution upon mitochondrial division."

                        "text": "Here, we show that ERMES and the Miro GTPase Gem1 function in the process of ERMD, which serves to couple the segregation of mitochondria and mtDNA in cells. Specifically, our data support a model in which ERMES creates ER\u2013mitochondria contacts along the mitochondrial network that serve to link actively replicating nucleoids to mitochondrial division and the subsequent Gem1-dependent spatial resolution of newly generated mitochondrial tips. Such a mechanism is likely required for efficient mtDNA distribution throughout the cell in addition to nucleoid segregation <i>per se</i>, as long-range movement of nucleoids within the organelle is limited (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nunnari et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Okamoto et al., 1998</a>). In mammalian cells, nucleoids are similarly localized at mitochondrial division sites and mitochondrial tips, suggesting that ERMD also plays this fundamental role in humans (<a href=\"#bib12\">Garrido et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Iborra et al., 2004</a>). In this context, although the Miro GTPase family is highly conserved in eukaryotes, Miro orthologs are not found in organisms that lack mtDNA, such as <i>Giardia intestinalis</i> and <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>, and possess mitochondrial-related mitosomes or hydrogenosomes, respectively (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vlahou et al., 2011</a>). This correlation is consistent with a fundamental role of Miro in mtDNA segregation. Also consistent with this view, <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells lose mitochondrial DNA at a significantly higher frequency than wild-type cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frederick et al., 2004</a>)."

However, we currently lack an understanding of what drives mitochondrial nucleoid segregation and of the mechanism underlying the spatial coupling of ER\u2013mitochondria contact sites and nucleoids. Thus, alternative mitochondrial-specific mechanisms may exist to coordinate the timing of nucleoid replication and segregation with mitochondrial division."

Our data are consistent with the model in which ERMES functions early in ERMD to mediate the biogenesis of this specialized region of ER\u2013mitochondria contact. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the ERMES complex functions to generate the ER tubules associated with constriction and/or to actively produce mitochondrial constriction at the sites of contact. ERMES has also been implicated as a bridge between mitochondria and the actomyosin network and thus may function at division sites to coordinate the recruitment of cytoskeletal and motor proteins, which could generate force required for mitochondrial constriction and/or distribution following division (<a href=\"#bib1\">Boldogh et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2003</a>). Indeed, a recent study suggests that the actin cytoskeleton may be involved in mitochondrial division at ER\u2013mitochondria contacts in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Korobova et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "In contrast to ERMES, our data indicate that Gem1 functions relatively late in ERMD to promote the physical separation of mitochondrial tips generated by membrane scission. Specifically, our data point to a role for Gem1 post-scission in the negative regulation of ER\u2013mitochondria contacts to facilitate the resolution of mitochondrial tips. Evidence from higher eukaryotes suggests that the Gem1 ortholog, Miro1/2, functions in mitochondrial distribution by connecting mitochondria directly to a kinesin-1 adaptor protein Milton/TRAK to enable the microtubule based transport of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fransson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Glater et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang and Schwarz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Misko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Analogously, Gem1 in yeast may also function to negatively regulate ER\u2013mitochondria contacts by facilitating the recruitment of motility factors to mitochondrial tips following division. However, while the Miro GTPase family is remarkably conserved (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vlahou et al., 2011</a>), the mechanisms of mitochondrial transport are divergent in eukaryotes. In many fungi, including budding yeast, mitochondrial distribution is actin dependent (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hermann et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Simon et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Boldogh et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2003</a>), and in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, Miro is not required for microtubule-dependent mitochondrial transport (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vlahou et al., 2011</a>). Thus, alternatively, Gem1 may function in ERMD more directly to regulate the physical link between mitochondria and the ER via ERMES. Consistent with this idea, Gem1 associates with ERMES foci, and, in the absence of Gem1, it has been reported that ERMES forms fewer and larger foci per cell (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kornmann et al., 2011</a>). This model of Gem1 function is also supported by the observation that mutations in the first GTPase domain of Gem1 abolish both Gem1\u2019s function in ERMD and its association with ERMES (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frederick et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kornmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Koshiba et al., 2011</a>). In addition, in mammalian cells, Miro1 is found at ER\u2013mitochondria contacts (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kornmann et al., 2011</a>). In this context, the defect in mitochondrial segregation observed in <i>gem1</i>\u0394 cells at ER-associated mitochondrial constriction sites could result from the ER physically hindering mitochondrial motility. In this case, it is also possible that the mitochondrial motility defects in higher eukaryotes caused by Miro1/2 dysfunction are a secondary consequence of enhanced ER\u2013mitochondria contacts."
