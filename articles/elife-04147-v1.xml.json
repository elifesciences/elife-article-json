From that primary neural code relevant information has to be extracted for accurate navigation. We analyzed how different odor features such as hedonic valence and intensity are functionally integrated in the lateral horn (LH) of the vinegar fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We characterized an olfactory-processing pathway, comprised of inhibitory projection neurons (iPNs) that target the LH exclusively, at morphological, functional and behavioral levels. We demonstrate that iPNs are subdivided into two morphological groups encoding positive hedonic valence or intensity information and conveying these features into separate domains in the LH. Silencing iPNs severely diminished flies' attraction behavior. Moreover, functional imaging disclosed a LH region tuned to repulsive odors comprised exclusively of third-order neurons. We provide evidence for a feature-based map in the LH, and elucidate its role as the center for integrating behaviorally relevant olfactory information."

From that primary neural code relevant information has to be extracted for accurate navigation. We analyzed how different odor features such as hedonic valence and intensity are functionally integrated in the lateral horn (LH) of the vinegar fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We characterized an olfactory-processing pathway, comprised of inhibitory projection neurons (iPNs) that target the LH exclusively, at morphological, functional and behavioral levels. We demonstrate that iPNs are subdivided into two morphological groups encoding positive hedonic valence or intensity information and conveying these features into separate domains in the LH. Silencing iPNs severely diminished flies' attraction behavior. Moreover, functional imaging disclosed a LH region tuned to repulsive odors comprised exclusively of third-order neurons. We provide evidence for a feature-based map in the LH, and elucidate its role as the center for integrating behaviorally relevant olfactory information."

These have three essential tasks: First, the external world has to be translated into an internal representation in the form of an accurate neural map. Second, the neural map has to be readable and interpretable, that is, the generated neural code must allow common attributes to be extracted across stimuli to enable the animal to make the best decisions. Third, the animal has to be able to adapt to environmental changes and to form a sensory memory of new stimuli. Many studies have been dedicated to unraveling the primary transformation from a stimulus into an initial neural representation within various sensory systems (<a href=\"#bib33\">Manni and Petrosini, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</a>) and to elucidating neuronal plasticity and sensory memory formation in higher-level processing centers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heisenberg, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pasternak and Greenlee, 2005</a>). The ability to extract features and integrate stimulus modalities have so far mainly been studied in the visual system (<a href=\"#bib31\">Livingstone and Hubel, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bausenwein et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nassi and Callaway, 2009</a>).

Like other sensory systems, the olfactory system employs a spatio-temporal map to translate the variables in chemosensory space into neuronal activity patterns in the brain. This map emerges when the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with the same chemosensory receptors converge into one exclusive glomerulus in the antennal lobe (AL) which represents the equivalent to the mammalian olfactory bulb (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hildebrand and Shepherd, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vosshall et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</a>). Glomeruli, the functional and morphological units of the AL, are microcircuits comprising OSNs, multiglomerular local interneurons (LNs) and uniglomerular output neurons, so-called excitatory projection neurons (ePNs) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wilson and Mainen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</a>) that convey the olfactory information to higher brain centers, as the mushroom body calyx (MBc) and the lateral horn (LH) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stocker et al., 1997</a>). The stringent spatial arrangement of OSNs and ePNs in the AL generates a spatial map containing characteristic combinatorial glomerular activity patterns for all odorants (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fiala et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Couto et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</a>). The MBc is involved in olfactory memory formation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heisenberg, 2003</a>) and enables a contextualization of the odor space (<a href=\"#bib3\">Caron et al., 2013</a>). By exclusion, the LH is believed to be involved in innate olfactory behavior (<a href=\"#bib10\">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>). Excitatory PNs retain the sensory information encoded in the AL and form glomerulus-dependent, stereotypic axonal terminal fields in the LH (<a href=\"#bib34\">Marin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wong et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tanaka et al., 2004</a>). Compartmentalization in the LH has been observed in form of a spatial segregation of ePNs innervating specific glomerular subgroups (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tanaka et al., 2004</a>), fruit and pheromone odor information processing ePNs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>) as well as ammonia and amine vs carbon dioxide coding ePNs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Min et al., 2013</a>)."

Notably, the mACT projects from the AL to the LH exclusively and consists of inhibitory PNs (iPNs), which exhibit also uniglomerular but mainly multiglomerular AL innervations (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ito et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Okada et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liang et al., 2013</a>). Both PN populations have been attributed different coding properties: Although both PN populations exhibit odor responses to overlapping odor ligands, iPNs seems to be broader tuned than ePNs (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, while ePNs encode rather odor identity (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wilson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Silbering et al., 2008</a>), iPNs have been shown to enhance innate discrimination of closely related odors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Parnas et al., 2013</a>). Together, these PN populations process information on dual olfactory pathways (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), as do processing mechanisms in other sensory modalities (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nassi and Callaway, 2009</a>), and most likely accomplish different olfactory behaviors. The mainly multiglomerular AL pattern of iPNs suggests that these neurons extract characteristic stimulus features from the AL code and re-integrate this information into the LH to mediate innate odorant-guided behavior. This assumption is further supported by two recent studies showing that the inhibitory input from the AL to the LH is module-specific, that is, selective for food odors and pheromones (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fisek and Wilson, 2014</a>), while the connectivity in the MBc is rather probabilistic (<a href=\"#bib36\">Murthy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Caron et al., 2013</a>)."

In this study, we characterized and dissected the iPN olfactory processing pathway regarding the coding of odor quality and intensity at morphological, functional and behavioral levels. By linking odor-evoked activity patterns in the LH to odor-guided behavior, we provide evidence that iPNs mediate odor attraction. Furthermore, our data demonstrate a feature-based, spatially segregated activity map in the LH comprised of iPNs and third-order neurons and thus expand its role as a center for integrating behaviorally relevant olfactory information."

In contrast, ePN somata are located anterodorsally and laterally of the AL, and their axons project through the iACT or oACT to the MBc and the LH (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stocker et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Marin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wong et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lai et al., 2008</a>). To analyze the innervation patterns of iPNs and ePNs, we labeled both PN populations simultaneously in vivo using the enhancer trap lines <i>GH146-QF</i> and <i>MZ699-GAL4</i> that label the majority of ePNs (60%) and iPNs (86%), respectively (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lai et al., 2008</a>). Double-labeling shows that both PN types innervate overlapping regions in the AL and the LH, while a small posterior-lateral LH area is targeted only by ePNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In GH146-positive (GH146+) PNs, immunolabeling reveals GABA production in all \u223c6 PNs of the ventral cell cluster (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wilson and Laurent, 2005</a>), whereas ePNs of this line are exclusively cholinergic (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shang et al., 2007</a>).

The reconstruction and identification of all AL glomeruli provided 53 glomeruli, of which 75% were innervated by MZ699+ iPNs (40) while 70% (37) were covered by GH146+ ePNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). 55% of all glomeruli were innervated by both lines. Notably, dendritic <i>MZ699-GAL4</i> innervation density was not homogeneous. Certain glomeruli were densely innervated (e.g., DM2, DM4 and DM5), while others did not reveal any postsynaptic sites (e.g., DL1, DL4 and DL5). Hence MZ699+ iPNs target specific glomerular subsets selectively, which suggests that these neurons have a particular function within the olfactory network."

The NNMF analysis extracted three clearly reproducible and spatially robust ORDs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, see NNMF part in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section). Notably, ORDs occupying common temporal kinetics exhibited highly stereotypic spatial patterns. We termed the ORDs LH-PM (<span class=\"underline\">LH</span>-<span class=\"underline\">p</span>osterior-<span class=\"underline\">m</span>edial), LH-AM (<span class=\"underline\">LH</span>-<span class=\"underline\">a</span>nterior-<span class=\"underline\">m</span>edial) and LH-AL (<span class=\"underline\">LH</span>-<span class=\"underline\">a</span>nterior-<span class=\"underline\">l</span>ateral) according to their anatomical positions. To validate our observations, we extended our stimulus array to 11 additional odorants and applied each at three concentrations. Odorants were chosen according to chemical classes, hedonic valence and biological value. Hence, the odor set included acids, lactones, terpenes, aromatics, alcohols, esters, ketones and the natural blend, balsamic vinegar. Remarkably, analysis of the additional odorants revealed neuronal activity exclusively within the three described ORDs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2,3</a>). Furthermore, median NNMF-extracted Ca<sup>2+</sup> response traces with indicated statistical quartiles illustrate very low variability and highly reproducible LH signals. The LH-PM area chiefly revealed robust odor-evoked responses across concentrations, while the LH-AM and LH-AL were mainly activated at very high odor concentrations by distinct odorants. The global responsiveness within separate ORDs in the LH substantiates our finding of a relatively broad AL input to MZ699+ iPNs which converges into three spatially regionalized and stereotypic LH activity domains."

Next we illuminated PA-GFP in single somata to selectively label individual MZ699+ iPNs from the soma up to the farthest axonal terminals in the LH. Individual iPNs were reconstructed and transformed into a reference brain using the END1-2 background (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grabe et al., 2014</a>) to align neurons of different individuals. Based on their innervation pattern in the LH, MZ699+ iPNs could be assigned to two major morphological classes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). As expected from the extracted ORDs, one iPN group diverged to the LH-PM region (8/25 of iPNs), while a second group extended their axonal terminations within the LH-AM area (10/25 of iPNs). In order to statistically substantiate our observation, we performed a cluster analysis based on a similarity score (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kohl et al., 2013</a>) of the target areas of all terminals of each iPN in the LH (for details see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The dendrogram of morphological similarity between each individual iPN shows that all, except one iPN, could be clustered according to their target region in either the LH-AM or LH-PM area (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) which confirms the classification into two major categories. Additionally, we performed a principal component analysis based on the distances of the similarity scores showing that both neuronal classes possess significantly different target areas in the LH (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; p &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOSIM)."

(2013)</a>. Instead, MZ699+ iPNs develop mainly oligoglomerular patterns innervating on average 5.4 \u00b1 3.9 glomeruli (mean \u00b1 SD), which are not necessarily in close proximity. It is important to note here, that the glomerular innervations of iPNs are rather sparse in comparison to the innervation of ePNs which complicates the identification of truly innervated glomeruli. After classifying all registered neurons according to their LH zones along with their glomerular innervations, we noted a spatial subdivision of MZ699+ iPN dendritic fields in the AL (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Whereas LH-PM iPNs extended dendrites mainly into glomeruli from the ventro- or dorsomedial area of the AL (e.g., DM4, DM2, VM7, VM5d), iPNs targeting the LH-AM zone innervated glomeruli ranging from the ventro- and dorsoanterior to the dorsocentral region (e.g., DC3, VC1, VA6, VL1). We observed that a glomerulus is typically innervated by only LH-PM iPNs or LH-AM iPNs. However, we also found a few cases where a glomerulus can be innervated by both iPN types (e.g., glomeruli D and DC2). In order to analyze whether the two categories of iPNs can also be statistically separated according to their glomerular innervations in the AL, we performed a cluster analysis based on the glomeruli innervated by each individual iPN (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Notably, the two iPN classes could be clearly clustered into two groups due to their specific AL innervations. This finding is further supported by a principal component analysis showing that iPNs targeting the LH-PM region innervate a significant different glomerular subset than iPNs that send their axonal terminals to the LH-AM area (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; p &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOSIM). In accordance with our finding of two major iPN categories is the study by <a href=\"#bib26\">Lai et al. (2008)</a> who observed several different stereotyped projection patterns of multiglomerular MZ699+ single-cell clones that could be broadly categorized into two groups based on the dendritic and axonal projection patterns. While we observed corresponding innervated areas in the AL, the described target areas in the LH seem to differ. However, due to the lack of 3D reconstruction of the single-cell clone data, the innervation patterns cannot be compared in detail."

Since our observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the LH-AL region might reflect activity from vlPr neurons rather than iPNs, we dissected the neuronal contributions within each extracted ORD by conducting transection experiments using two-photon laser-mediated microdissection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). By transecting the mACT, we aimed at abolishing LH-responses deriving from MZ699+ iPNs, while cutting the plF connection should eliminate potential odor-evoked vlPr neuron activity. To achieve unambiguous and comparable results, functional imaging was performed in both brain hemispheres simultaneously. Immediately after the intact brain areas were imaged, the tracts were selectively transected on one brain side each (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and the imaging procedure was repeated. We applied a reduced odor set that elicited activity in all ORDs and performed NNMF for pre- and post-lesion recordings. Transecting the mACT significantly reduced responses in the LH-PM and LH-AM region, whereas LH-AL responses were significantly abolished by plF-ablation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Notably, we observed that LH-AL responses to some odors were significantly increased after mACT transection as a consequence of the suppression of iPN inhibition of vlPr neurons confirming the study by <a href=\"#bib30\">Liang et al.

To precisely target iPN function, we expressed an RNAi construct against glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GADi) to selectively knock-down the GABA synthesis in MZ699+ iPNs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We confirmed the reduction in GABA production via immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Since vlPr neurons are not GABAergic, they were not affected by the RNAi expression (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Parnas et al., 2013</a>). Using wild-type flies and parental controls, we conducted T-maze assays (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tully and Quinn, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chakraborty et al., 2009</a>) with nine of the odorants applied in functional imaging experiments at medium and high concentrations. Notably, flies with silenced MZ699+ iPN GABA production revealed a neutral or aversive behavioral response to attractive odors, while repellent odors evoked an even stronger aversion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). To compare the T-maze data more accurately, we calculated the average change of behavioral response indices (RIs) between GADi flies and parental controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Indeed, all responses changed in a negative direction, indicating MZ699+ iPNs play a crucial role in mediating attraction behavior. The sole exception involved high concentrations of the most repulsive odor, acetophenone, since this odor had already induced maximum aversion. Overall, these experiments reveal a crucial function of MZ699+ iPNs in mediating attraction behavior by releasing GABA in the LH."

To correlate the complete ORD pattern array with innate behavioral preferences, we assigned behavioral RIs for all odors at median and high odor concentrations using the T-maze assay as in our previous experiment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Since extremely low concentrations rarely evoked any behavioral response, we excluded the 10<sup>\u22126</sup> concentration in this analysis. It is important to note here, that different behavioral assays for testing olfactory preferences in flies might lead to contradictory results. However, the majority of odors used here was also tested in two other behavioral paradigms, the trap assay (<a href=\"#bib55\">St\u00f6kl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Knaden et al., 2012</a>) and the FlyWalk (<a href=\"#bib51\">Steck et al., 2012</a>) (pers. comm.

The LH-AL domain, constituted mainly by vlPr neurons, is coding aversive odors, while attractive odors activated only the LH-PM and LH-AM domains that derive from MZ699+ iPNs.

Remarkably, activity within the LH-PM was totally independent of concentration, whereas activity in both anterior domains was significantly correlated to odor intensity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

A remarkable anatomical feature of MZ699+ iPNs is their glomerular innervation pattern in the AL. Whereas GH146+ ePNs are uniglomerular and retain the topographic code in their axonal arrangement (<a href=\"#bib34\">Marin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wong et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>), most MZ699+ iPNs possess oligoglomerular innervations suggesting that these neurons might not convey precise odor-identity information. In addition, MZ699+ iPNs in the AL diverge only into specific glomerular subsets, and so might be pre-determined to selectively extract common features of distinct odors. We have previously shown that the AL map at the PN level exhibits a spatial segregation of valence representation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Knaden et al., 2012</a>). Certain glomeruli, which have been classified as aversion coding at the GH146+ ePN level, are omitted by MZ699+ iPNs, whereas most glomeruli classified as attraction coding are particularly densely innervated. These results suggest that within the MZ699+ iPN population, mainly positive odor traits are extracted, whereas the odor information of negative valence is neglected. This conclusion is consistent with the recent finding that one type of LH neurons is receiving input from PNs that mainly innervate glomeruli coding fruity-smelling acetates (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fisek and Wilson, 2014</a>) which represent attractive odor cues (<a href=\"#bib24\">Knaden et al., 2012</a>). We furthermore demonstrate that the MZ699+ iPN population is split into two major morphological classes possessing a clear spatial segregation in the AL which is strictly maintained within the LH. It has to be kept in mind that we do not cover all iPNs by using <i>MZ699-GAL4</i>. Further experiments characterizing the \u223c6 missing MZ699\u2013 iPNs, which are labeled by <i>GH146-GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wilson and Laurent, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lai et al., 2008</a>), will elucidate if our assumptions apply for the whole iPN population."

In addition the study by <a href=\"#bib30\">Liang et al.

Our neuronal tracing and transection experiments validated the LH segmentation into two medial domains that derive from MZ699+ iPNs, and the LH-AL domain formed by vlPr neurons. In line with our observations are morphological studies on ePNs and third-order LH neurons revealing a similarly tight constriction into three zones within the LH (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tanaka et al., 2004</a>), while single-cell labeling combined with image registration resulted in five ePN target zones (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>). However, the ePN terminal zones do not necessarily correspond to the target domains of iPNs, since it has recently been shown that MZ699+ iPNs do not inhibit odor responses of GH146+ ePNs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liang et al., 2013</a>) and that the presynaptic sites of iPNs are spatially separated from those of ePNs (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2014</a>).

Our behavioral results demonstrate that selectively silencing MZ699+ iPNs severely reduced the flies' odor attraction behavior. Hence our results suggest that MZ699+ iPNs are capable of extracting specific features from the combinatorial code emerging in the AL. A behavioral study revealed that silencing MBc neurons impairs odor attraction but not repulsion (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2003b</a>). The authors drew the conclusion that the LH is involved in mediating innate repulsion rather than attraction. These results are not necessarily contradictory to ours since some ePNs might activate the LH-AL domain exclusively (i.e., vlPr neurons). On the other hand, <a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al. (2003b)</a> did not include highly concentrated attractive odors. Therefore it is possible that in their experiments, the odor detection threshold was simply reduced, so that only highly concentrated odors, which induced odor aversion, could be distinguished.

This finding fits well to our observations that iPNs are activated mainly by attractive odors while vlPr neurons are not, likely due to the inhibitory input from iPNs. VlPr neurons are, on the other hand, almost solely activated by repellent odors, which do hardly activate iPNs and therefore do not induce a strong inhibition to vlPr neurons. Repellent odors most likely activate vlPr neurons via ACh release of ePNs which is supported by immunostainings with pre- and postsynaptic markers indicating that vlPr neurons receive input in the LH, while the vlPr represents their major output region (<a href=\"#bib40\">Parnas et al., 2013</a>). The vlPr is supposedly also a target of visual neurons from the optic lobe (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tanaka et al., 2004</a>) implying that a certain integration of different sensory modalities takes place at this central processing relay. Given that iPNs are inhibitory neurons, the underlying mechanism of odor attraction behavior might therefore be an inhibition of aversive neuronal circuits from the LH to the vlPr that are mainly composed of vlPr neurons. However, this assumption needs to be verified with further experiments elucidating if vlPr neurons are sufficient and necessary to mediate odor aversion."

Also in line with our results is a study from honeybees which shows that the representation of different pheromone types is spatially segregated in the LH (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roussel et al., 2014</a>), indicating that odors eliciting specific behaviors are coded according to their biological values."

In contrast to PCA and ICA, NNMF constrains both the extracted time-courses and pixel participations to be positive. Positive pixel participation enabled us to make a straightforward physiological interpretation, reading the participation values as the contribution strength of an underlying physiological domain. The restriction to positive time-courses reflects the fact that we did not observe any significant decrease of fluorescence in response to an odor in the original measurement data. For each animal we performed decomposition into <i>k</i> = 5 components. This was sufficient to explain most of the data's variance (88% + 8%, error is standard deviation across individuals). The remaining variance in the residual matrix R contained no additional domains but rather reflected remaining movement artifacts of the measurements (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Of the five components extracted by NNMF, three stood out prominently (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>): First, they were extracted in all animals at very clearly defined anatomical positions.

Third, they were spatially overlapping with the selected three components. Instead of independent ORDs, these regions might convey fluorescence changes independent of odor stimulation or an overlapping region of two of the reliable ORDs. A validation of our NNMF-based results with spatial ICA yielded very similar, but slightly worse results. Whereas the three reliable ORDs from NNMF were also extracted in spatial ICA, the two remaining components exhibited much higher variability than when obtained with NNMF. Hence, we conclude that the LH area comprising MZ699+ neurons consists of three ORDs.

Neurons of different individuals were embedded into the reference brain using a labelfield registration as previously described (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rybak et al., 2010</a>). Briefly, segmented labels of brain neuropils (AL, MBc, LH) were registered onto a reference brain image using affine registration followed by elastic warping. In a second step, the calculated transformation matrix was applied to the respective neuron morphology that was then aligned to the reference brain image."

WT, parental controls (P[GAD1-RNAi] or P[MZ699-GAL4]) and test flies carrying both insertions were tested separately under identical conditions. The response index (RI) was calculated as (O-C)/T, where O is the number of flies in the odor arm, C is the number of flies in the control arm, and T is the total number of flies used in the trial. Hence, the RI ranges from \u22121 (complete avoidance) to 1 (complete attraction). Each experiment was carried out on 30 flies and was repeated 12 times. Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test was used for global differences in the dataset. Whenever the Multiple Comparison Test was significant (i.e., p &lt; 0.05), a posthoc test for selected pairs was performed, that is, between the GADi-flies and the other three control lines as we were not interested in differences among the different control lines. All RI were tested against 0 (no response) by using the Wilcoxon-rank-sum test."

Several recent studies have begun to classify the function of the iPNs and have shown a role in odor discrimination, in inhibiting food odor processing, and in pheromone-mediated behaviors. This study comprehensively examines the anatomy and functional properties of iPNs and makes several important contributions, including that (1) iPNs may be functionally segregated into two different classes based on glomerular inputs, targeting region in the lateral horn and response properties; (2) they are required for olfactory attraction; and (3) they likely inhibit third order neurons that mediate aversion. Overall, this is a very rigorous, nicely executed study that makes important contributions to odor processing in the lateral horn."

Another important finding is that blocking GABA-synthesis in iPNs makes the odors more aversive. These results suggest that the inhibition from iPNs usually keeps the aversive pathways under check. This is in agreement with recent work from Liqun Luo's lab (Liang et al), which showed that vlPR neurons form an aversive pathway inhibited by iPNs. The functional imaging and microdissection experiments performed by the authors provide additional (but indirect) evidence to support the same conclusion. Thus, this work reports discoveries and contributions appropriate for publication in <i>eLife.</i>"

Effectively this quantifies the relative overlap of the target area of all pairs of iPNs. For clustering, the similarity scores were converted to distances and a hierarchical clustering was performed using UPGMA method.

Since the weak signals in the AL appear to be located in the axonal bundle that projects into the mACT, but not in glomerular structures, we presume that the protein or a HA carrying precursor might be transported in the appearing region, but not specifically be targeted to synaptic boutons.

However, 12 out of the 14 odors were also tested in a trap assay (<a href=\"#bib24\">Knaden et al., 2012</a>, CellReports; Stoekl et al., 2010, CurrBiol; trap assay results for balsamic vinegar are unpublished) and 8 were analyzed using the FlyWalk paradigm (<a href=\"#bib51\">Steck et al. 2012</a>, SciReports; pers. comm. Markus Knaden). Notably, all odors, except one, induced the same valence in the trap assay, while 5 odors out of 8 evoked the same behavioral response in the FlyWalk. We added a supplemental figure comparing the odor valence in different behavioral assays (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). In those cases where we observed a difference, the behavioral response was shifted to neutral, i.e. no response was observed. However, we never ever observed that an odor was attractive in one behavioral assay and aversive in another and <i>vice versa</i>. We therefore think that the valence that we determined with our behavioral assay in this study seems to be representative for those odors that we have selected. We discussed this point now in our manuscript and added a figure supplement to <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> as referred to above."
