In plants, the encapsulating cell wall literally binds neighbouring cells to each other and limits cellular sliding/migration. In contrast to its developmental importance, growth regulation is poorly understood in plants. Here, we reveal that the phytohormone auxin impacts on the shape of the biggest plant organelle, the vacuole. TIR1/AFBs-dependent auxin signalling posttranslationally controls the protein abundance of vacuolar SNARE components. Genetic and pharmacological interference with the auxin effect on vacuolar SNAREs interrelates with auxin-resistant vacuolar morphogenesis and cell size regulation. Vacuolar SNARE VTI11 is strictly required for auxin-reliant vacuolar morphogenesis and loss of function renders cells largely insensitive to auxin-dependent growth inhibition. Our data suggests that the adaptation of SNARE-dependent vacuolar morphogenesis allows auxin to limit cellular expansion, contributing to root organ growth rates."

Genetic and pharmacological interference with the auxin effect on vacuolar SNAREs interrelates with auxin-resistant vacuolar morphogenesis and cell size regulation. Vacuolar SNARE VTI11 is strictly required for auxin-reliant vacuolar morphogenesis and loss of function renders cells largely insensitive to auxin-dependent growth inhibition. Our data suggests that the adaptation of SNARE-dependent vacuolar morphogenesis allows auxin to limit cellular expansion, contributing to root organ growth rates."

The volume of the vacuole increases as the cell increases in size, and some researchers have suggested that the vacuole might help to control cell growth. A plant hormone called auxin can alter the growth of plant cells. However, this hormone's effect depends on the position of the cell in the plant; for example, it inhibits the growth of root cells, but promotes the growth of cells in the shoots and leaves. Nevertheless, it is not clear precisely how auxin controls plant cell growth."

Enzymes called PI4 kinases were also shown to be involved in the control of the SNARE proteins in response to the auxin hormone."

TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESISTANT1 (TIR1) and its homologs AUXIN F-BOX PROTEINS (AFBs) have been unequivocally demonstrated to be auxin receptors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Dharmasiri et al., 2005a</a>). Genomic auxin responses are initiated by auxin binding to TIR1/AFBs, promoting its interaction with proteins of the AUXIN/INDOLE ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) family. Auxin-dependent formation of such a co-receptor pair triggers the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Aux/IAA proteins. In the absence of auxin, Aux/IAAs form inhibitory heterodimers with AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) family transcription factors. Thus, auxin-dependent Aux/IAA degradation leads to the release of ARF transcription factors and subsequent transcriptional responses (for reviews, see <a href=\"#bib27\">Quint and Gray, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sauer et al., 2013</a>)."

It has been suggested that auxin analogue 5-F-IAA preferentially triggers genomic auxin responses via TIR1/AFBs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Robert et al., 2010</a>) and it indeed induced small luminal vacuoles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B,E</a>).

Proximity of adjacent membrane allows the interaction of v (vesicle)- and t (target)-SNAREs to form a complex, allowing the fusion of vesicles to specific target membranes. SNAREs are essential for eukaryotic vesicle trafficking and according to structural features SNAREs are divided in R (arginine)- and Q (glutamine)-SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Martens and McMahon, 2008</a>). In yeast, the SNARE complex is furthermore central in homotypic vacuolar membrane remodelling and proteomic approaches have identified conserved SNARE complexes at the plant tonoplast (<a href=\"#bib3\">Carter et al., 2004</a>). Ergo, we tested whether auxin affects vacuolar SNAREs in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Remarkably, increased auxin biosynthesis or exogenous application of auxin increased the fluorescence intensity of tonoplast localised SNAREs, such as VAMP711-YFP, SYP21-YFP and SYP22-GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013L,N,O</a>). Auxin severely impacts on vacuolar appearance and, hence, it could be that membrane crowding induces higher fluorescence. To address this question we performed co-localisation of VAMP711-RFP/YFP and membrane dyes, such as FM4-64 and MDY-64. Notably, VAMP711-RFP/YFP, but not the membrane dyes showed auxin-induced signal intensities, suggesting that the auxin effect on vacuolar SNAREs does not rely on membrane crowding (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To exclude cell division and to assess whether the auxin effect on vacuolar morphology could limit cellular growth, we subsequently concentrated solely on cellular expansion of epidermal cells in the elongation zone and recorded their maximum expansion under high auxin conditions.

Surprisingly, little is actually known about mechanisms controlling vacuolar morphology and whether the vacuoles are indeed involved in growth regulation. Plant vacuoles, inter alia, are claimed to be important cellular osmoregulators, and accordingly, have been hypothesised as contributing to turgor-dependent cellular growth induction (<a href=\"#bib17\">Marty, 1999</a>). This may explain the correlation between vacuolarisation with cellular size. Though appealing, also this hypothesis awaits experimental validation. Hence, the potential role of auxin in turgor regulation should also be carefully assessed. Just such a role has been insinuated in recent papers related to lateral root emergence. Auxin responses have been reported to reduce cellular pressure in cell files facing lateral root primordia (<a href=\"#bib24\">Peret et al., 2012</a>) and vacuolar morphology alterations have been recently described in endodermal tissues during lateral root emergence (<a href=\"#bib24\">Peret et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Vermeer et al., 2014</a>). However, these proposed auxin responses are not related to cellular growth regulation and it remains to be seen whether the auxin impact on vacuolar morphology described here is related to interference with turgor pressure."

Several pieces of independent evidence suggest that the modulation of the vacuolar SNAREs allows the phytohormone auxin to limit cellular growth. Future studies will further assess the precise molecular role of vacuolar SNAREs in shaping the plant vacuole. Auxin impacts on vacuolar SNAREs in a posttranslational manner and it is tempting to speculate that auxin could impose a conformational change on the SNARE complex, possibly affecting its stability and activity. Accordingly, the auxin effect on vacuolar SNAREs could impact on homotypic vacuolar fusion events, leading to smaller luminal structures. Alternatively, also a structural role of SNAREs has been envisioned (<a href=\"#bib7\">Di Sansebastiano, 2013</a>), which could be yet another mechanism to impact on vacuolar organisation. Notably, a recent study suggested that most vacuolar structures are interconnected within an untreated cell (<a href=\"#bib38\">Viotti et al., 2013</a>). Hence, it needs to be seen how precisely auxin impacts on vacuolar morphology and whether these structures are still interconnected in high auxin conditions."

In this light, the luminal increase of plant vacuoles alone may not be sufficient to induce larger cell sizes (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) due to cell wall limitations.

After centrifugation, 15 \u00b5l of the extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and blotted onto a 0.2 \u00b5m polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BioRad). After blocking with a solution of 5% skim milk powder in TBS-T (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM TRIS/HCl pH = 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20) the membrane was probed with an anti-GFP antibody (JL-8; Clontech; Takara Bio Europe, Japan) diluted 1:2000 in skim milk TBS-T solution or anti-alpha-tubulin (B-5-1-1; Sigma) diluted 1:50000 in skim milk TBS-T solution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova, Germany) was employed as secondary antibody (1:20000). For detection, the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent detection reagent (Thermo scientific, MA, USA) was used. Three independent root samples were quantified with imageJ and normalized to alpha-tubulin, means and standard error were calculated and statistical significance was evaluated by the Student's <i>t</i>-test using graphpad (<a href=\"http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/\">http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/</a>). Figure shows a representative experiment (out of three independent repetitions)."

The authors show a strong increase in the signal of a YFP fusion protein upon NAA treatment and conclude that this means increased protein levels. This conclusion is challenged by the fact that artificial overexpression of VAMP711 did not influence vacuolar morphology and, more importantly, that the lipid marker MDY64 shows exactly the same NAA-induced increase in fluorescence as the VAMP11-YFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures. 1E, F</a>). This draws the validity of the microscopic assessment of SNARE abundance into question, particularly because the authors showed similar NAA-dependent increases in the abundance for a number of other vacuolar SNAREs, and even for <i>syp21</i>, which is actually on a pre-vacuolar compartment. My concern is that the contraction of the vacuoles into compact structures might lead to erroneous measures of the fusion proteins, due to the fact that the authors evaluated only a single confocal section, probably through the center plane of these cells, rather than a stack of images covering the entire depth. A consequence could be that in cells with voluminous vacuoles much of the vacuolar membranes lies outside the confocal section and will not be measured. In the contracted state, a greater share of this membrane should be closer to the center of the cell, leading to an increase in the fluorescence in the single confocal section."

Moreover, previous work (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gjetting et al., 2012</a>) suggested that exogenous application of auxin does not detectably affect cytosolic pH. Hence, we conclude that the observed effects are not likely related to changes in cytosolic pH."

Long term auxin treatments and its effect on vacuolar shapes are very easily detectable by eye. However, shorter time points require a solid quantification method to capture morphological changes. We implemented the vacuolar morphology index to detect such major changes in vacuolar morphology. Notably, the measurement of the biggest vacuolar structure turned out to be a very reproducible approximation for vacuolar morphology. Importantly the measured values are quite stable in between independent experiments (both untreated and treated). Moreover, the index is quite sensitive to auxin induced morphological changes, which guided us to depict earliest morphological changes following short-term auxin treatments. Notably, the vacuolar morphology index robustly correlates with the auxin effect on cell sizes. Therefore, we feel that this simple quantification method is straightforward and very suitable for the here conducted work. In this respect, we kindly agree also with reviewer 3 (\u201cThe method of quantification is relatively simple and crude but does effectively reflect the changes in vacuolar morphology which in some cases are visually very striking.\u201d). Said that we also would like to mention that we would indeed further develop tools to depict and quantify the plant vacuoles. In our on-going research, we are also investigating the potential effect of auxin on vacuolar volume and whether it is a parameter that is most relevant. We will develop in the future more sophisticated 3D imaging approaches, which will allow us to address additional questions, such as raised by reviewer 1."
