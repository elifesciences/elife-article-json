The Dorsal Organ Cool Cells (DOCCs) of the <i>Drosophila</i> larva are a set of exceptionally thermosensitive neurons critical for larval cool avoidance. Here, we show that DOCC cool-sensing is mediated by Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), a family of sensory receptors widely studied in invertebrate chemical sensing. We find that two IRs, IR21a and IR25a, are required to mediate DOCC responses to cooling and are required for cool avoidance behavior. Furthermore, we find that ectopic expression of IR21a can confer cool-responsiveness in an <i>Ir25a</i>-dependent manner, suggesting an instructive role for IR21a in thermosensing. Together, these data show that IR family receptors can function together to mediate thermosensation of exquisite sensitivity."

The Dorsal Organ Cool Cells (DOCCs) of the <i>Drosophila</i> larva are a set of exceptionally thermosensitive neurons critical for larval cool avoidance. Here, we show that DOCC cool-sensing is mediated by Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), a family of sensory receptors widely studied in invertebrate chemical sensing. We find that two IRs, IR21a and IR25a, are required to mediate DOCC responses to cooling and are required for cool avoidance behavior. Furthermore, we find that ectopic expression of IR21a can confer cool-responsiveness in an <i>Ir25a</i>-dependent manner, suggesting an instructive role for IR21a in thermosensing. Together, these data show that IR family receptors can function together to mediate thermosensation of exquisite sensitivity."

For example, this ability allows animals to avoid conditions that are either too hot or too cold, and to maintain an optimal body temperature. Most animals detect temperature via nerve cells called thermoreceptors. These sensors are often extremely sensitive and some can even detect changes in temperature of just a few thousandths of a degree per second. However, it is not clear how thermoreceptors detect temperature with such sensitivity, and many of the key molecules involved in this ability are unknown."

Now, Ni, Klein et al. \u2013 who include some of the researchers involved in the 2015 work \u2013 have determined that these nerves use a combination of two receptors to detect cooling. Unexpectedly, these two receptors \u2013 Ionotropic Receptors called IR21a and IR25a \u2013 had previously been implicated in the detection of chemicals rather than temperature. IR25a was well-known to combine with other related receptors to detect an array of tastes and smells, while IR21a was thought to act in a similar way but had not been associated with detecting any specific chemicals. These findings demonstrate that the combination of IR21a and IR25a detects temperature instead."

Combinations of IRs have been previously found to contribute to a wide range of chemosensory responses, including the detection of acids and amines (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rytz et al., 2013</a>). These findings extend the range of sensory stimuli mediated by these receptor combinations to cool temperatures. Interestingly, IR21a- and IR25a-dependent cool sensation appears independent of Brivido 1 and Brivido 2, two TRP channels implicated in cool sensing in the adult (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gallio et al., 2011</a>)."

IR25a has been shown to act with other IRs in the formation of chemoreceptors, potentially as heteromers (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rytz et al., 2013</a>). This precedent raises the appealing possibility that IR25a might form heteromeric thermoreceptors in combination with IR21a. However, our inability to readily reconstitute temperature-responsive receptor complexes in heterologous cells suggests that the mechanism by which these receptors contribute to cool responsiveness is likely to involve additional molecular cofactors. It is interesting to note that the range of cell types in which ectopic IR21a expression confers cool-sensitivity is so far restricted to neurons that already respond to temperature. This observation suggests the existence of additional co-factors or structures in these thermosensory cells that are critical for IR21a and IR25a to mediate responses to temperature. All studies to date implicate IRs as receptors for sensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rytz et al., 2013</a>), and our misexpression studies are consistent with a similar role for Ir21a and IR25a in cool sensation. However, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that they could have indirect, and possibly separate, functions in this process, for example, in regulating the expression or function of an unidentified cool receptor. Interestingly, IR25a was recently implicated in warmth-responsive resetting of the circadian clock, and suggested to confer warmth-sensitivity on its own, without the co-expression of other IRs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). The ability of IR25a to serve as a warmth receptor on its own would be a surprise given both its broad expression and its established role as an IR co-receptor (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abuin et al., 2011</a>). As IR25a misexpression only slightly enhanced the thermosensitivity of an already warmth-responsive neuron (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2015</a>), this raises the alternative possibility that \u2013 analogous to cool-sensing \u2013 IR25a acts not on its own, but rather as a co-receptor with other IRs involved in warmth-sensing."

Thus, related mechanisms could contribute to thermosensory responses not only in the DOCCs, but also in other cellular contexts and life stages. Moreover, the presence of orthologs of IR21a and IR25a across a range of insects (<a href=\"#bib10\">Croset et al., 2010</a>) raises the possibility that these IRs, along other members of the IR family, constitute a family of deeply-conserved thermosensors."

Chen et al. suggest IR25a can play an instructive role in thermosensing, acting as a warmth receptor capable of conferring warmth-sensitivity. Our data suggest that IR25a actually plays a permissive role, not specifically mediating hot, cold or chemical detection, but instead assisting other IRs responsible for mediating specific responses. Consistent with such a permissive role, our data show that IR25a also mediates cool sensing, suggesting that IR25a is not a warmth receptor, per se, but rather a molecule that can facilitate either warm or cold sensing depending on the cellular context. Further consistent with this notion, we show that IR25a does not act alone, but requires another IR to mediate cool sensation, and then show that misexpression of this other IR (IR21a) in the HC neurons can confer cool-sensitivity in an IR25a-dependent manner. Taken together, these data all support the notion that IR25a mediates thermosensing much like it mediates chemosensing, by assisting other IRs that have more cell-specific roles."

IR25a is expressed by hundreds of chemosensory neurons and does not appear to form functional chemoreceptors on its own. Instead, IR25a appears to play a permissive rather than an instructive role, serving as a co-receptor for odor-specific IRs that confer specificity for specific chemicals (Benton et al., 2009; Abuin et al., 2011; Silbering et al., 2011). Thus Chen et al.\u2019s suggestion that Ir25a could confer warmth sensitivity when expressed on its own was unexpected. Chen et al. state that \u201cIR25a misexpression confers temperature-dependent firing of heterologous neurons\u201d, but the neurons they were recording from tonically fire in a warmth-responsive fashion even without IR25a misexpression (Chen et al., Figure 4I). IR25a misexpression increases the temperature co-efficient (Q10) of their spiking from 2 to 4 (Chen et al., Figure 4I). As warming speeds up most processes by similar margins (~90% of biological Q10s are between 1.3 and 5.1), this IR25a-dependent thermosensitivity is rather weak. As we note in our manuscript, the requirement for other IR subunits to mediate warmth detection could explain why misexpression of IR25a alone did not confer strong thermosensitivity."

The ability of IR25a to serve as a warmth receptor on its own would be a surprise given both its broad expression and its established role as an IR co-receptor (Abuin et al., 2011). As IR25a misexpression only slightly enhanced the thermosensitivity of an already warmth-responsive neuron (Chen et al., 2015), this raises the alternative possibility that \u2013 analogous to cool-sensing \u2013 IR25a acts not on its own, but rather as a co-receptor with other IRs involved in warmth-sensing. \u201c"

This showed both that the DO is essential for the behavior and, in addition, that sensory neurons outside the DO are insufficient to support even weak cool avoidance. Calcium imaging was then used to identify 3 cool sensing neurons within each DO (the DOCCs) and a Gal4 expressed in the DOCCs, R11F02-Gal4, was identified (Klein et al., 2015; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). We found that inhibiting R11F02-Gal4 neurons eliminated cool avoidance (Klein et al. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), and that optogenetically activating them elicited the same behaviors as cooling (Klein et el. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C-D</a>). In the current manuscript, we extend this prior work, identifying a second DOCC-expressed driver, Ir21a-Gal4 (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, which demonstrates that Ir21a-Gal4 is expressed in the DOCCs but no other DO neurons), and find that expression of an Ir21a cDNA under Ir21-Gal4 control rescues cool avoidance. Taken together, the combined use of laser microsurgery and genetics establish the behavioral importance of the DOCCs."

Two recent RNA-seq studies suggest that NP4486-Gal4\u2019s expression pattern appears to reflect CR32207 rather than Brv1 (Menuz et al. 2014 and Shiao et al. 2013). Specifically, while NP4486-Gal4 is widely expressed in the adult antenna (Gallio et al., 2011)), neither RNA-seq study detected any Brv1 transcripts in the antenna. Instead, both detected robust CR32207 expression. These data suggest that NP4486-Gal4 reports on CR32207. This is reasonable, as NP4486-Gal4 is inserted upstream of CR32207\u2019s promoter, a common location for enhancer traps."

There are no Brv3 mutants. As shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2, Brv1 null mutants have a cool avoidance defect, but their DOCC neurons still respond to cold normally. A mutation can cause a behavioral defect in many ways, but whatever Brv1\u2019s role in cool avoidance, Brv1 is not required for DOCC cool sensing. Brv2 mutants show normal cool avoidance. Together our data indicate that IR-mediated cool sensing is independent of these receptors. The manuscript states: \u201cThus we detect no role for these receptors in cool sensing by the DOCCs.\u201d"
