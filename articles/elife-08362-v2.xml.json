Grids are organized in modules with different periodicity. We propose that the grid system implements a hierarchical code for space that economizes the number of neurons required to encode location with a given resolution across a range equal to the largest period. This theory predicts that (i) grid fields should lie on a triangular lattice, (ii) grid scales should follow a geometric progression, (iii) the ratio between adjacent grid scales should be \u221ae for idealized neurons, and lie between 1.4 and 1.7 for realistic neurons, (iv) the scale ratio should vary modestly within and between animals. These results explain the measured grid structure in rodents. We also predict optimal organization in one and three dimensions, the number of modules, and, with added assumptions, the ratio between grid periods and field widths."

Grids are organized in modules with different periodicity. We propose that the grid system implements a hierarchical code for space that economizes the number of neurons required to encode location with a given resolution across a range equal to the largest period. This theory predicts that (i) grid fields should lie on a triangular lattice, (ii) grid scales should follow a geometric progression, (iii) the ratio between adjacent grid scales should be \u221ae for idealized neurons, and lie between 1.4 and 1.7 for realistic neurons, (iv) the scale ratio should vary modestly within and between animals. These results explain the measured grid structure in rodents. We also predict optimal organization in one and three dimensions, the number of modules, and, with added assumptions, the ratio between grid periods and field widths."

The discovery of place cells in the rat hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib42\">O'Keefe, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</a>) suggested one potential locus for this map. Place cells have spatially localized firing fields which reorganize dramatically when the environment changes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>). Another potential locus for the cognitive map of space has been uncovered in the main input to hippocampus, a structure known as the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">Fyhn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>). When rats freely explore a two-dimensional open environment, individual \u2018grid cells\u2019 in the MEC display spatial firing fields that form a periodic triangular grid which tiles space (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Here, we propose that the grid system provides a hierarchical representation of space where fine grids provide precise location and coarse grids resolve ambiguity, and that the grids are organized to minimize the number of neurons required to achieve the behaviorally necessary spatial resolution across a spatial range equal in size to the period of the largest grid module. Our analyses thus assume that there is a behaviorally defined maximum range over which a fixed grid represents locations. Our hypotheses, together with general assumptions about tuning curve shape and decoding mechanism, explain the triangular lattice structure of two-dimensional grid cell firing maps and predict a geometric progression of grid scales. Crucially, the theory further predicts that the ratio of adjacent grid scales will be modestly variable within and between animals with a mean in the range 1.4\u20131.7 depending on the assumed decoding mechanism used by the brain. With additional assumptions the theory also predicts that the ratio between grid scale and individual grid field widths should lie in the same range. These predictions naturally explain the structural parameters of grid cell modules measured in rodents (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barry et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Giocomo et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>). Our results follow from general principles, and thus, we expect similar organization of the grid system in other species. The theory makes further predictions including: (a) the number of grid scales necessary to support navigation over typical behavioral distances (i.e., a logarithmic relation between number of modules and navigational range), (b) possible deficits in spatial behavior that will obtain upon inactivating specific grid modules, (c) the structure of one- and three-dimensional grids that will be relevant to navigation in, for example, bats (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yartsev et al., 2011</a>), (d) an estimate of the number of grid cells we expect in the mEC.

Within any module, grid cells have a variety of spatial phases so that at least one cell will respond at any physical location (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>). Grid modules with smaller field widths <i>l</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> provide more local spatial information than those with larger scales. However, this increased spatial precision comes at a cost: the correspondingly smaller periodicity <i>\u03bb</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> of these modules leads to increased ambiguity since there are more grid periods within a given spatial region (e.g., see scale 3 in the schematic one-dimensional grid in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>).

Consider an animal living in an 8 m linear track and requiring spatial precision of 1 m to support its behavior. To develop intuition, consider a simple model where location is represented in the animal's brain by reliable neurons with rectangular firing fields (e.g., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The animal could achieve the required resolution in a <i>place coding</i> scheme by having eight neurons tuned to respond when the animal is in 1 m wide, non-overlapping regions (see [<a href=\"#bib21\">Fiete et al., 2008</a>] for a related comparison between grid and place cells). Consider an alternative, the idealized <i>grid coding</i> scheme in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. Here, the two neurons at the largest scale (<i>\u03bb</i><sub>1</sub>) have 4 m wide tuning curves so that their responses just indicate the left and right halves of the track. The pairs of neurons at the next two scales have grid field widths of 2 m and 1 m respectively, and proportionally shorter periodicities as well. These pairs successively localize the animal into 2 m and 1 m bins. All told only six neurons are required, less than in the place coding scheme. This suggests that grid schemes that integrate multiple scales of representation can encode space more efficiently, that is, with fewer neural resources. In the sensory periphery, there is evidence of selection for more efficient circuit architectures (e.g., <a href=\"#bib47\">Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001</a>). If similar selection operates in cortex, the experimentally measured grid architecture should be predicted by maximizing the efficiency of the grid system given a behaviorally determined range and resolution. Thus, we seek to predict the key structural parameters of the grid system\u2014the ratios <i>r</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = <i>\u03bb</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>/<i>\u03bb</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub> relating adjacent scales (which need not be equal)."

Then the animal might be in either of the two marked locations. Avoiding ambiguity requires that <i>\u03bb</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub>, the period at scale <i>i</i> + 1, must exceed <i>l</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, the grid field width at scale <i>i</i>. Variants of this condition will recur in the more realistic models that we will consider. Theoretically, one could resolve the ambiguity in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> by combining the responses of more grid modules, provided they have mutually incommensurate periods (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fiete et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sreenivasan and Fiete, 2011</a>). However, anatomical evidence suggests that contiguous subsets of the mEC along the dorso\u2013ventral axis project topographically to the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib59\">Van Strien et al., 2009</a>). While there is evidence that hippocampal place cells are not formed and maintained by grid cell inputs alone (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bush et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>), for each of these restricted projections to represent a well-defined spatial map, ambiguities like the one in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> should be resolved at each scale. The hierarchical position encoding schemes that we consider below embody this observation by seeking to reduce position ambiguity at each scale, given the responses at larger scales."

Statistically, the best we can do is to use all these responses, which may individually be noisy, to find a probability distribution over physical locations that can then inform subsequent behavioral decisions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Thus, the population response at each scale <i>i</i> gives rise to a likelihood function over location <i>P</i>(<i>x</i>|<i>i</i>), which will have the same periodicity <i>\u03bb</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> as the individual grid cells' firing rates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This likelihood explicitly captures the uncertainty in location given the tuning and noise characteristics of the neural population in the module <i>i</i>. Because there are at least scores of neurons in each grid module (<a href=\"#bib52\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>) <i>P</i>(<i>x</i>|<i>i</i>) can be approximated as a periodic sum of Gaussians without making restrictive assumptions about the shapes of the tuning curves of individual grid cells, or about the precision of their periodicity, so long as the variability of individual neurons is weakly correlated and homogeneous. For example, even though individual grid cells can have somewhat different firing rates in each of their firing fields, this spatial heterogeneity will be smoothed in the posterior over the full population of cells, leading to much more accurate periodicity. In other words, individual grid cells show both spiking noise and \u2018noise\u2019 due to heterogeneity and imperfect periodicity of the firing rate maps. Both these forms of variability are smoothed by averaging over the population, provided, as we will assume, that there are enough cells and noise is not too correlated between cells."

In the probabilistic analysis, when the likelihood is combined across modules, there will be side lobes arising from the periodic peaks of the likelihood derived from module <i>i</i> multiplying the tails of the Gaussian arising from the previous modules. These side lobes increase location ambiguity (measured by the standard deviation <i>\u03b4</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> of the overall likelihood). Reducing the scale factor reduces the height of side lobes because the secondary peaks from module <i>i</i> move further into the tails of the Gaussian derived from the previous modules. Thus, conceptually, the optimal probabilistic scale factor is smaller than the winner-take-all case in order to suppress side lobes that arise in the combined likelihood across modules (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Such side lobes were absent in the winner-take-all analysis, which thus permits a more aggressive (larger) scale ratio that improves precision, without being penalized by increased ambiguity.

In other words, the periods of grid modules should be organized in a geometric progression. In one dimension, this organization may be thought of intuitively as implementing a neural analog of a base-<i>b</i> number system. Roughly, the largest scale localizes the animal into a coarse region of the environment and finer scales successively subdivide the region into <i>b</i> \u2018bins\u2019. For example, suppose that the largest scale has one firing field in the environment and that <i>b</i> = 2, so that subsequent scales subdivide this firing field into halves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Then, keeping track of which half the animal occupies at each scale gives a binary encoding of location. This is just like a binary number system being used to encode a number representing the location. Our problem of minimizing neuron number while fixing resolution is analogous to minimizing the product of the number of digits and the number of decimal places (which we can term <i>complexity</i>) needed to represent a given range <i>R</i> of integers in a base-<i>b</i> number system. The complexity is approximately <i>C</i> \u223c <i>b</i> log<sub><i>b</i></sub> <i>R</i>. What \u2018base\u2019 minimizes the complexity of the representation?

It is remarkable that natural selection seems to have reached such efficient solutions for encoding location."

Robustly, for any given decoding scheme, our theory would predict a smaller scaling ratio for 3d grids than for 2d grids.

However, a naive model where place cells are sums of grid cells would also suggest that the multiple place fields would be arranged in an orderly, possibly periodic, manner. To the contrary, the data (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fenton et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rich et al., 2014</a>) show that the multiple place fields of dorsal hippocampal cells are organized in a disorderly fashion.

We have not attempted to investigate this in detail because there is also significant evidence (summarized in <a href=\"#bib11\">Bush et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>) that place cells are not formed and maintained via simple summation of grid cells alone, although they are influenced by them.

The answer depends on the dimensionality of the grid. In two dimensions, if neurons have weakly correlated noise, modular variation of the coverage factor does not affect the optimal grid at all. This is because the coverage factor cancels out of all relevant formulae, a coincidence of two dimensions (see Optimizing the grid system: probabilistic decoder, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, and p. 112 of <a href=\"#bib14\">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</a>). In one and three dimensions, variation of <i>d</i> between modules will have an effect on the optimal ratios between the variable modules. Thus, if the coverage factor is found to vary between grid modules for animals navigating one and three dimensions, our theory can be tested by comparing its predictions for the corresponding variations in grid scale factors. Similarly, even in two dimensions, if noise is correlated between grid cells, then variability in <i>d</i> can affect our predicted scale factor. This provides another avenue for testing our theory."

Additional data on this ratio parameter drawn from multiple grid modules may serve to distinguish and select between potential decoding models for the grid system.

(2008)</a> proposed that the grid system is organized to represent very large ranges in space by exploiting the incommensurability (i.e., lack of common rational factors) of different grid periods. As originally proposed, the grid scales in this scheme were not hierarchically organized (as we now know they are <a href=\"#bib52\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>) but were of similar magnitude, and hence it was particularly important to suggest a scheme where a large spatial range could be represented using grids with small and similar periods. Using all the scales together (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fiete et al., 2008</a>) argued that it is easy to generate ranges of representation that are much larger than necessary for behavior, and Sreenivasan and Fiete argued that the excess capacity could be used for error correction over distances relevant for behavior (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sreenivasan and Fiete, 2011</a>). However, recent experiments tell us that there is a hierarchy of scales (<a href=\"#bib52\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>) which should make the representation of behaviorally plausible range of 20\u2013100 m easily accessible in the alternative hierarchical coding scheme that we have proposed. Nevertheless, we have checked that a grid coding scheme with the optimal scale ratio predicted by our theory can represent space over ranges larger than the largest grid period (\u2018Range of location coding in a grid system\u2019, <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). However, to achieve this larger range, the number of neurons in each module will have to increase relative to the minimum in order to shrink the widths of the peaks in the likelihood function over position. It could be that animals sometimes exploit this excess capacity either for error correction or to avoid remapping over a range larger than the period of the largest grid. That said, experiments do tell us that remapping occurs readily over relatively small (meter length) scales at least for dorsal (small scale) place cells and grid cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fyhn et al., 2007</a>) in tasks that involve spatial cues."

In such a simple grid to place cell transformation, lesioning the modules with small periods will expand place field widths, while lesioning modules with large periods will lead to increased firing at locations outside the main place field, at scales set by the missing module. Similar effects are predicted for any simple decoder of a lesioned hierarchical grid system that has no other location related inputs\u2014that is, animals with lesions to fine grid modules will show less precision in spatial behavior, while animals with lesions to large grid modules will confound well-separated locations. In contrast, in a non-hierarchical grid scheme with similar but incommensurate periods, lesions of any module lead to the appearance of multiple place fields at many scales for each place cell. Recent studies which ablated a large fraction of the mEC at all depths showed an increase in place field widths (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hales et al., 2014</a>), as did the more focal lesions of <a href=\"#bib43\">Ormond and McNaughton (2015)</a> along the dorso\u2013ventral axis of the mEC. However, there are multiple challenges in interpreting these experiments. First, the data of <a href=\"#bib52\">Stensola et al. (2012)</a> shows that there are modules with both small and large periods at every depth along the mEC\u2014the dorsal mEC is simply enriched in modules with large periods.

A simple linear transformation from a hierarchical grid to place cells would predict that removing large periods increases the number of place fields, but <a href=\"#bib28\">Hales et al. (2014)</a> did not look for this effect while in <a href=\"#bib43\">Ormond and McNaughton (2015)</a> the reported number of place fields decreases after lesions (including complete dirsruption of place fields of some cells). The underlying difficulty in interpretation is that while place cells might be summing up grid cells, there is evidence that they can be formed and maintained through mechanisms that may not critically involve the mEC at all (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bush et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>). Thus, despite the interpretation given in <a href=\"#bib32\">Kubie and Fox (2015)</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ormond and McNaughton (2015)</a> in favor of the partial validity of a linearly summed grid to place model, it is difficult for theory to make a definitive prediction for experiments until the inter-relation of the mEC and hippocampus is better understood."

To arrive at these results the authors formulated a population coding model where independent Poisson neurons have periodic one-dimensional tuning curves. The responses of these model neurons were used to construct a maximum likelihood estimator of position, whose asymptotic estimation error was bounded in terms of the Fisher information\u2014thus the resolution of the grid was defined in terms of the Fisher information of the neural population (which can, however, dramatically overestimate coding precision for neurons with multimodal tuning curves [<a href=\"#bib5\">Bethge et al., 2002</a>]).

The Fisher information approximation to position error in <a href=\"#bib36\">Mathis et al. (2012a)</a> is only valid over a certain range of parameters. An ambiguity-avoidance constraint keeps the analysis within this range, but introduces two challenges for an optimization procedure: (i) the optimum depends on the details of the constraint, which was somewhat arbitrarily chosen and was dependent on the variability and tuning curve shape of grid cells, and (ii) the optimum turns out to saturate the constraint, so that for some choices of constraint the procedure is pushed right to the edge of where the Fisher information is a valid approximation at all, causing difficulties for the self-consistency of the procedure."

The authors then analyzed the dependence of the decoding error on the grid scale factor and found that, in their theory, the optimal scale factor depends on \u2018the number of neurons per module and peak firing rate\u2019 and, relatedly, on the \u2018tolerable level of error\u2019 during decoding (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mathis et al., 2012a</a>).

Conceptually, we can think of the winner-take-all analysis as effectively approximating the likelihood in terms of periodic boxcar functions; for the probabilistic analysis, we treat the likelihood as a periodic sum-of-Gaussians. Since at least scores of cells are being combined within modules, the Gaussian approximation to local likelihood peaks is valid, allowing us to circumvent detailed analysis of tuning curves and variability of individual neurons. These approximations allow analytical treatment of the optimization problem over a much wider parameter range without requiring arbitrary hand-imposed constraints. Our formulation of grid resolution then simply estimates the number of distinct regions that a fixed range can be divided into. We then fix this resolution as being behaviorally determined and minimize the number of required neurons while allowing the periods of the modules, and, crucially, the number of modules, to vary to achieve the minimum."

Our results constitute evidence that such principles might also operate in the organization of cognitive circuits processing non-sensory variables. Furthermore, the existence of an efficiency argument for grid organization of spatial coding suggests that grid systems may be universal amongst the vertebrates, and not just a rodent specialization. In fact, there is evidence that humans (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doeller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jacobs et al., 2013</a>) and other primates (<a href=\"#bib30\">Killian et al., 2012</a>) also have grid systems.

In the present probabilistic context, we can view <i>\u03b4</i><sub>0</sub> as the standard deviation of the a priori distribution over position before the grid system is consulted, but it will turn out that the precise value or meaning of <i>\u03b4</i><sub>0</sub> is unimportant.

Given the formula for <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> derived in the next section, this can be carried out numerically. To understand the optimum, it is helpful to observe that the problem has a symmetry under permutations of <i>i</i>. So we can guess that in the optimum all the <i>\u03bb</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>/<i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>/<i>\u03b4</i><sub><i>i</i> \u2212 1</sub> and <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> will be equal to a fixed <i>\u03bb</i>/<i>\u03c3</i>, <i>\u03c3</i>/<i>\u03b4</i>, and <i>\u03c1</i>. We can look for a solution with this symmetry and then check that it is an optimum. First, using the symmetry, we write <i>N</i> = <i>cm</i>(<i>\u03bb</i>/<i>\u03c3</i>) and <i>R</i> = <i>\u03c1</i><sup><i>m</i></sup>. It follows that <i>N</i> = <i>c</i>(1/ln<i>\u03c1</i>)(<i>\u03bb</i>/<i>\u03c3</i>) and we want to minimize it with respect to <i>\u03bb</i>/<i>\u03c3</i> and <i>\u03c3</i>/<i>\u03b4</i>. Now, <i>\u03c1</i>(<i>\u03bb</i>/<i>\u03c3</i>, <i>\u03c3</i>/<i>\u03b4</i>) is a complicated function of its arguments (<a href=\"#equ30\">Equation 30</a>) which has a maximum value as a function of <i>\u03c3</i>/<i>\u03b4</i> for any fixed <i>\u03bb</i>/<i>\u03c3</i>. To minimize <i>N</i> at fixed <i>\u03bb</i>/<i>\u03c3</i>, we should maximize <i>\u03c1</i> with respect to <i>\u03c3</i>/<i>\u03b4</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

(2007)</a>, we first read the raw data from Figure 3B of their paper using the software GraphClick, which allows retrieval of the original (x,y)-coordinates from the image. This gave the scales of grid cells recorded from six different rats. For each animal, we grouped the grids that had similar periodicities (i.e., differed by less than 20%) and calculated the mean periodicity for each group. We defined this mean periodicity as the scale of each group. For four out of six rats, there were two scales in the data. For one out six rats, there were three grid scales. For the remaining rat, only one scale was obtained as only one cell was recorded from that rat. We excluded this rat from further analysis. We then calculated the ratio between adjacent grid scales, resulting in 6 ratios from five rats. The mean and variance of the ratio were 1.64 and 0.09, respectively (<i>n</i> = 6)."

We took the largest grid period to be comparable to the behavioral range. In fact, if the periods <i>\u03bb</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> of the different modules are incommensurate with each other (i.e., they do not share common integer factors), it should be possible to resolve location over ranges larger than the largest grid period (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fiete et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sreenivasan and Fiete, 2011</a>). The grid schemes that we predict share this virtue since they predict scale ratios that are not simple rational numbers. However, the precise maximum range will also depend on the widths of the grid fields <i>l</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> relative to the period and on the number of grid cells <i>n</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> in each module. In the probabilistic decoding scheme described in the main text, these parameters determine the standard deviation <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> of the periodic peaks in the likelihood of position given the activity in module <i>i</i>. The full range of unambiguous location representation depends on the ratios <i>\u03bb</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>/<i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>. Increasing this ratio will tend to increase the range of unambiguous representation, but at the cost of increasing the number of cells in each module."

Again, to model the effect of lesioning grid module <i>i</i>, we set the <math id=\"inf19\"><mrow><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\">~</mo></mover></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>. In this grid scheme, lesioning any grid module leads to qualitatively similar effects on the place cell activity, as they all lead to the emergence of several place fields (<a href=\"#fig8\">Appendix figure 3</a>). This is in contrast with the hierarchical scheme, in which lesioning the largest scale leads to an expansion of place fields rather than an increase in the number of fields."

Thus, although a similar topic has been addressed in various guises by several previous publications (i.e. <a href=\"#bib21\">Fiete et al., 2008</a>; Mathis et al., 2012, 2013; <a href=\"#bib58\">Towse et al., 2014</a>), there is some novelty to the current work.

Our prediction is supported by a recent study demonstrating effects of lesions including dorsal mEC on place field widths in small environments (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hales et al., 2014</a>)\u201d. This is misleading for several reasons. First, as described above, this statement neglects to mention the wider body of evidence contradicting the hypothesis that grid cell inputs solely generate place cell firing fields. Second, the aim of the cited study (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hales et al., 2014</a>) was to examine the effect of eliminating all grid cell inputs to place cells, and \u223c85% of the total mEC volume was ablated, including 94.6% of layer II and 83.5% of layer III. Are the authors suggesting that the observed effects on place cell firing are a result of remaining grid cell inputs from modules with a large or small period? Third, the more specific prediction is that lesioning grid modules with large periods will lead to the appearance of additional place fields at periodic, grid-like locations in two dimensions, but that analysis is not made or discussed in <a href=\"#bib28\">Hales et al. (2014)</a>. Fourth, more recent experimental evidence indicates that focal inactivations of dorsal or ventral mEC each produce place field expansion, and neither generated increased firing at locations outside the main place field \u2013 in fact, that data showed a trend towards a decrease in the number of firing fields exhibited by each place cell following focal inactivations (Figure S7 in Ormond et al., 2015). Each of those results also contradict the predictions of a grid cell to place cell model, despite the strange interpretation of the data made in that paper.

The comments of the referees have been helpful in this regard. We have attempted to be clear and specific that Mathis et al. explored grid coding in one dimension using Fisher information and numerical simulation to explore decoding error. They found that the set of periods that maximizes the Fisher information is approximated by a geometric series in a regime of large-scale ratios. By contrast, we rely on a simpler formulation of optimal coding with straightforward assumptions about tradeoffs between ambiguity and resolution in a hierarchical grid. We take a simpler definition of the resolution (as the largest scale divided by the smallest scale the system can discriminate), assume that the grid encodes location with a restricted range, and then seek to minimize the resources (number of neurons) required to achieve a given resolution within this range. Our simpler formulation allows us to extend our analysis to any number of dimensions, and to predict the values of structural parameters of the grid such as the ratio between periods, the grid geometry etc. We have added substantially to the Discussion to address these points."

They introduce a no-ambiguity constraint to keep them within this range, but this creates two challenges for an optimization procedure: (1) The optimum depends on the details of the constraint, which was somewhat arbitrarily chosen and dependent on the variability, the tuning curve shape of grid cells and a \u201ctolerable error level\u201d, and (2) The optimum turns out to saturate the constraint, so for some choices of the constraint the procedure is pushed right to the edge of where the Fisher information is a valid approximation at all, causing difficulties for the self-consistency of the procedure. Because of these limits on the Fisher information approximation, Mathis et al. proceed to measure decoding error directly through their numerical studies. But here a complete optimization is not possible because there are too many inter-related parameters. This last point is a limitation of any numerical study. In contrast, we estimated decoding error directly by working with approximated forms of the posteriors rather than by approximating decoding error in terms of the Fisher information. For the winner-take-all analysis, we effectively approximate posteriors as periodic boxcar functions, for the probabilistic analysis as periodic sums-of-Gaussians. These choices allow analytical treatment of the optimization problem over a much wider parameter range without requiring arbitrary hand-imposed constraints."

First, with the assumptions as formulated in their paper, and the scores of neurons that are known to exist in each grid module, the scale ratios would generically be predicted to be much larger than 1 (please see the detailed response to Reviewer 2). This is in tension with data. Even ignoring this point, optimizing the Fisher information generally predicts a hierarchy of scale ratios, and only predicts geometric scaling if that scale is significantly greater than 1. Experimentally the scale ratio is \u223c1.5. Thus, it seems that optimizing Fisher information does not predict geometric scaling in the regime of relevance to experiment. What is more, while Mathis et al. can only predict a geometric scaling if the scale is large, their <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> illustrates that for large scale ratios the Fisher information does a poor job in approximating the decoding error. So this means that their prediction of a geometric series of periods, even in one dimension, has a limited range of validity. The optimal one-dimensional grid in our work is perched near the edge of the estimated range where their analysis appears to be valid."

Fenton et al. claim that 85% of dorsal CA1 place cells have multiple place fields, and the majority of cells in Rich et al. have multiple place fields in a 48m track, some having dozens of place fields. However, these studies show that the locations of these place fields are sporadic, perhaps even random according to some distribution. This disordered structure may be in tension with a simplistic summation view of the grid-to-place cell transformation. On the other hand, it should be noted that the data of Stensola et al. shows that there is significant variability of the period, orientation and ellipticity within each module. As part of a different collaboration, one of us (VB) has been investigating the consequences of this variability for spatial coverage \u2013 it seems to produce significant differences in the relative phase of grid cells between unit cells of the grid lattice. This variability can change the prediction of regularity in the locations of multiple place fields in a naive summation model. That said, investigating this properly lies outside the scope of the present paper. Thus we have contented ourselves with adding appropriate nuance and caveats as follows: (a) indicate that a naive summation model of place cells along with the anatomy of mEC-hippocampal projections predicts multiple place fields for a single dorsal place cell, as seen in experiments, (b) a naive model of this kind also predicts a orderly distribution of place fields which is not seen, (c) however, the variability in the grids even within a module likely interferes with the predicted order, (d) and in any case there is significant evidence (see Bush et al., and Sasaki et al. for a summary) that place cells are not formed and maintained by grid cells alone.

So the focal inactivations of Ormond et al. would seem to still be inactivating modules with multiple periods. Thus, even in a naive summation model, we would expect expansion of place fields for all of these inactivations with larger expansion for dorsal fields. This is because dorsal lesions would get rid of more cells in the smallest modules, and would lead to a greater broadening. Ventral lesions would still remove some cells with small periods, and so the broadening effect should be smaller as Ormond et al. appear to see."

What is more, these figures likely include various cases where the place cells went from having one field to having none (i.e. the place field simply disappeared) \u2013 it is hard to be sure, because the information was not provided as far as we can tell, and thus it is hard to evaluate whether this is in fact inconsistent with a summation model. One could also imagine that the general increase in the size and noisiness of place fields might lead to a decrease in the number of place fields that can be accommodated in the 7m linear track that they were working with. In particular, the decrease in theta power makes their measurements much more prone to noise. Finally, Ormond et al. are recording dorsally in CA1 and CA3. If the anatomy of Witter et al. that we cite is accurately indicative of functional connectivity, then ventral inactivation in mEC would have less clear effects on these dorsal hippocampal recordings. That makes it still more problematic to interpret what is going on. We also note that none of the individual examples depicted in Figure S5 of that paper show a decrease in ambiguity after lesions.

A legitimate way to do theoretical neuroscience is to make informed assumptions, build a theory with these assumptions, and then use the match between predictions of the theory and data as guide to whether the assumptions are reasonable. Certainly, methodologically, this seems like a very reasonable way to proceed, and is well within the venerable tradition of theoretical work in the older field of physics."

One way to think of it is to imagine the WTA decoder as an approximation that replaces the smooth posterior with a flat function that drops to zero outside its support. The slight difference in the optimal ratio arises technically from the truncation of the tails in the Gaussian posterior, and the flattening of the posterior inside the region of support. Compared to the Gaussian, a boxcar likelihood has less precision (because it spreads out uniformly rather than being concentrated on the center), but it also implies less possibility of ambiguity (because it has zero tails). So the WTA decoder chooses a more aggressive (larger) scale ratio that improves precision, without being penalized by increased ambiguity."
