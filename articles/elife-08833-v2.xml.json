However, whether longevity mechanisms counteract the effects of aging continually throughout life, or whether they act during specific periods of life, preventing changes that precede mortality is unclear. Here, we uncover <i>transcriptional drift</i>, a phenomenon that describes how aging causes genes within functional groups to change expression in opposing directions. These changes cause a transcriptome-wide loss in mRNA stoichiometry and loss of co-expression patterns in aging animals, as compared to young adults. Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a model, we show that extending lifespan by inhibiting serotonergic signals by the antidepressant mianserin attenuates transcriptional drift, allowing the preservation of a younger transcriptome into an older age. Our data are consistent with a model in which inhibition of serotonergic signals slows age-dependent physiological decline and the associated rise in mortality levels exclusively in young adults, thereby postponing the onset of major mortality."

However, whether longevity mechanisms counteract the effects of aging continually throughout life, or whether they act during specific periods of life, preventing changes that precede mortality is unclear. Here, we uncover <i>transcriptional drift</i>, a phenomenon that describes how aging causes genes within functional groups to change expression in opposing directions. These changes cause a transcriptome-wide loss in mRNA stoichiometry and loss of co-expression patterns in aging animals, as compared to young adults. Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a model, we show that extending lifespan by inhibiting serotonergic signals by the antidepressant mianserin attenuates transcriptional drift, allowing the preservation of a younger transcriptome into an older age. Our data are consistent with a model in which inhibition of serotonergic signals slows age-dependent physiological decline and the associated rise in mortality levels exclusively in young adults, thereby postponing the onset of major mortality."

Over time, experiments have shown that DNA damage, changes in behavior and changes to gene expression are all markers of aging in the worms."

Specifically, in groups of genes that work together, some genes increase expression, while others decrease expression with age.

Maintaining coordinated patterns of gene expression postpones the onset of age-related bodily declines and extends the life of treated worms by extending the duration of young adulthood and postponing the onset of age-associated death. The drug also appears to protect against stress-induced changes in gene expression. This suggests that some of the age-related shifts in gene expression occur when cells fail to recover normal gene expression patterns after a stressful event."

                        "text": "The most widely used standard to measure aging of an organism is the quantification of lifespan (<a href=\"#bib59\">Partridge and Gems, 2007</a>). Lifespan relates to aging, as the latter causes the degeneration of tissues and organs, thereby increasing mortality due to systemic functional tissue failure (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balch et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Bishop et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">David et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Haigis and Sweet-Cordero, 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib77\">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib28\">Gladyshev, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib14\">Burkewitz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Currais, 2015</a>). Several genetic and pharmacological strategies have been shown to prolong the lifespan of various organisms, including <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kenyon et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Curran and Ruvkun, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Evason et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alavez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Ye et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Tatum et al., 2015</a>). Mutations in <i>age-1</i> or <i>daf-2,</i> for example, slow degenerative processes occurring throughout life, thereby constantly lowering mortality rates (<a href=\"#bib36\">Johnson, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kenyon et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Taylor et al., 2014</a>). Age-associated degenerative processes such as a decline in proteostatic capacity are not necessarily restricted to older organisms but can also be observed in young adults (<a href=\"#bib44\">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">2015b</a>). This raises the possibility of degenerative processes that occur only in young adults and thus specifically contribute to the rise of mortality during young adulthood. Any longevity mechanisms preventing such a degenerative process would specifically slow mortality rates during the period of young adulthood, effectively prolonging its duration to postpone the onset of major age-associated mortality around midlife (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bartke, 2015</a>). However, to identify such mechanisms would require mortality-independent metrics of age-associated change, as age-associated mortality rates during young adulthood are difficult to determine by demographic analysis against the back drop of non-aging-related death events (<a href=\"#bib59\">Partridge and Gems, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Beltran-Sancheza et al., 2012</a>)."

Molecular markers of aging include sets of genes whose expression change with age, such as micro-RNAs, electron transport chain (ETC) components, or genes involved in posttranslational modifications such as methylation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Budovskaya et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib21\">de Magalhaes et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib62\">Pincus et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib33\">Horvath et al., 2015</a>). However, aging also increases DNA damage, affects nuclear architecture, chromatin complexes, chromatin modifications, and the transcriptional machinery (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mostoslavsky et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Feser et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Greer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Maures et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fushan et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, an emerging alternative approach to measure specific gene expression changes with age is to quantify the progressive imbalance in gene expression patterns as a function of age. Two such approaches, one measuring transcriptional noise, the cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, and the other measuring decreasing correlation in the expression of genetic modules, showed a loss of co-expression patterns with age (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bahar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Southworth et al., 2009</a>). These studies suggest that age-associated changes can be measured independently from mortality by tracking the loss of gene expression patterns that are observed in young animals."

These studies revealed that aging causes <i>transcriptional drift</i>, an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon in which the expression of genes change in opposing directions within functional groups. These changes cause a transcriptome-wide loss in mRNA stoichiometry and loss of co-expression patterns in aging animals, as compared to young adults. Mianserin treatment reduced age-associated transcriptional drift across ~80% of the transcriptome, preserving many characteristics of transcriptomes of younger animals. We used transcriptional drift along with mortality analysis as metrics to monitor aging and find that mianserin treatment extended lifespan by exclusively slowing age-associated changes in young adults, thereby postponing the onset of mortality."

We separated genes into sets that showed increased or decreased expression in response to mianserin, to conduct gene-set enrichment analysis. This revealed hundreds of gene ontologies (GO) that changed in response to mianserin (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashburner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Mi et al., 2005</a>). We observed that many GOs were enriched for both, genes that increased as well as decreased as a consequence of aging. This observation complicated any interpretation on whether pathways were activated or inhibited in response to mianserin, and how the associated function (GO) relates to mianserin-induced lifespan extension (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>)."

We generated 50 representative pie charts out of the 249 GO annotations that contained genes that increased or decreased in expression by day 10 due to aging. These charts suggested that as animals age and become older, genes change expression in opposing directions, disrupting relative mRNA ratios within the GO, when compared to young adults (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, aging changed the stoichiometric relationship between mRNAs belonging to the same functional group (GO). In many cases, the fractions of genes that increased, decreased or did not change in expression showed no consistent pattern, nor provided any insight into the pathway activity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As expected from our previous studies (<a href=\"#bib65\">Rangaraju et al., 2015a</a>), the expression levels of some superoxide detoxification genes were higher in mianserin-treated animals compared to age-matched controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Exceptions were the expression levels of <i>sod-4</i> and <i>sod-5,</i> which were lowered upon mianserin treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). However, plotting expression changes of superoxide detoxification genes as a function of age (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>, left panel) revealed again a scenario in which genes changed in opposing directions as seen in the pie charts for many GOs before (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Some mRNAs including those of <i>sod-4, -5</i> increased with age, while some decreased (<i>sod-1, -2, prdx-2, 3, 6</i>) and some did not change (<i>ctl-1, 2, 3</i>), leading to an overall 5-10-fold change in stoichiometric balance among superoxide detoxification-associated mRNAs by day 5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>, left panel). More interestingly, if the expression of an <i>sod</i> increased with age, mianserin treatment prevented the increase and if the expression of an <i>sod</i> decreased with age, mianserin prevented the decrease (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>, right panel). Thus, when we took the mRNA expression levels of young animals into account, the emerging picture suggested that mianserin treatment attenuated age-associated gene expression changes."

Indeed, many GO annotations that increased expression with age were decreased by mianserin treatment and vice versa (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). This attenuation of age-associated changes by mianserin treatment was even more pronounced for individual genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a>). Analyzing cohort #1 showed a significant change in expression levels of 3,367 genes, as the animals aged from day 1 to day 3, and a change in 5,947 genes from day 1 to day 10 (FDR &lt; 0.1) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a>, significant genes only). Mianserin treatment reduced these age-associated expression changes in over 90% of cases. Including all age-associated expression changes for the 19,196 different transcripts present in our data-set, we found that mianserin treatment attenuated age-associated changes in transcription in 15,095 out of 19,169 genes (80%, binomial P &lt; 10<sup>\u2013100</sup>). Thus, most of the changes observed between mianserin-treated and untreated animals are due to mianserin preventing transcriptional changes with age."

Such a plot can be constructed for whole transcriptomes as well as for any functional subset of genes, for example, genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation or lysosome biology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h,i</a>). In young adults, the log-fold change is 0 and values close to 0 therefore suggest gene expression as seen in young adults (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h,i</a>). To quantify transcriptional drift changes with age (type II), we calculated the variance of the log-fold change for genes involved in each pathway. For the purpose of this study, we will refer to this variance as drift-variance (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). If gene expression ratios within a pathway stay constant with age, drift-variance will stay small. If a majority of genes within a pathway change expression in opposing directions or if the rates by which they change differ dramatically, drift-variance will increase. Note that \u201ctranscriptional drift\u201d is different from \u201ctranscriptional noise\u201d in that the former analyzes variance <i>among</i> genes <i>within the same biological replicates,</i> whereas the latter analyzes <i>variance of the same genes among biological replicates</i>. Hence, how far the aging transcriptome deviates away from the transcriptome seen in young adults can be graphed in a Tukey-style box plot, which plots the drift-variance as a function of age (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h,i</a>).

As FUDR arrests embryonic development before the birth of these neurons, the drift-plots cannot be influenced by RNA derived from eggs. Explanations for <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> In the experiments presented in the main manuscript, we used FUDR to sterilize the animals from which we subsequently extracted RNA for RNA-seq. Thus, our samples contained fractions of egg RNA. The following control experiments and analysis show that the fraction of RNA in our samples coming from eggs is small and does not influence the phenomenon of transcriptional drift and its attenuation by mianserin. We first isolated eggs from FUDR-treated and untreated animals. FUDR treatment causes the cell mass inside the eggs to shrink and to terminally arrest at around bean stage (400\u2013500 nuclei) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). FUDR-treated animals all contained similar numbers of eggs 24 hr after FUDR treatement (n=298) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>) Note that many of the reported FUDR side-effects such as a lack of germline are not observed in 96-well liquid culture (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gomez-Amaro et al., 2015</a>). Extracting RNA from whole worms or eggs isolated from whole worms showed that FUDR-treated eggs contained 5 times less RNA compared to untreated eggs. The fraction of RNA originating from the eggs in FUDR-treated worms was roughly ~5% (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2c,d</a>). We next asked whether this fraction could in anyway influence the phenomenon of transcriptional drift. The original plots (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, or <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2e</a>) of the entire transcriptome show that drift-variance increases in the interquartile mean (boxes) showing that it is not driven by a set of outlier genes, making it unlikely that the 5% fraction would influence drift-variance (<a href=\"#bib42\">Krzywinski and Altman, 2014</a>). Nevertheless, to test possible interference, we calculated drift plots for various subsets of our data excluding transcrips expressed in eggs. The Murphy data were derived from CF512 (sterile) animals and thus any genes detected do not originate from eggs. We therefore excluded all genes not detected by Murphy et al from our data-set and recalculated drift. The resulting drift plot still shows a dramatic increase in drift-variance and attenuation by mianserin (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2f</a>). A potential problem with the approach used in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2f</a> is that it only removed eggs/germline genes that are specific for eggs but that it did not remove genes that are present in both eggs and soma. We therefore removed all genes that were identified in <i>C. elegans</i> eggs by RNA-seq from our data-set to plot <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2g</a> (<a href=\"#bib58\">Osborne Nishimura et al., 2015</a>). Of the 7,700 transcripts identified in eggs, 7,200 were present in our data-set. Note that this approach removes all ubiquitously expressed genes like ribosomal, mitochondrial and similar housekeeping genes that are present in both embryos and soma. Even though this operation removes only 7,200 out of 19,196 individual genes present in the data-set, these 7,200 genes account for 73% of total mRNA counts. Despite this dramatic reduction in overall mRNA transcripts, the drift plot combining the remaining 11, 904 genes (mostly low expressing genes) confirms an increase in drift-variance with age that is suppressed by mianserin (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2g</a>). To identify gene-sets that cannot possibly originate from the FUDR-treated eggs we exploited the specific arrest in embryonic development caused by FUDR. The DIC images suggested that FUDR arrests embryonic development before the birth of AFD, ASE and NSM neurons. If so, genes in our data-set that are specifically expressed in these neurons have to originate from the adult somatic tissue. To test that FUDR treatment prevents the birth of these neurons, we imaged eggs of <i>C. elegans</i> carrying a P<i>gcy-8::</i>GFP transgene (AFD marker) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2h, i, j</a>). Eggs from untreated animals showed a clear expression of the marker while FUDR-treated eggs did not (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2i, j</a> (n&gt;100)). FUDR did not repress the expression of the P<i>gcy-8</i>::GFP transgene in adults, showing that the lack of a P<i>gcy-8</i>::GFP signal in FUDR-treated eggs is due to an arrest before the neurons are born and not due to inhibition of the reporter expression by FUDR. As AFD neurons are born before ASE and NSM neurons, these results suggested that none of these three neurons are present in FUDR-treated eggs (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sulston et al., 1983</a>). After having established the absence of AFD, ASE and NSM neurons in eggs derived from FUDR treated animals, we then used the published gene-sets that are highly enriched in these three neuron types (AFD, ASE, NSM) to construct drift-plots (<a href=\"#bib22\">Etchberger et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib73\">Spencer et al., 2014</a>). Even for these highly restricted sets of genes, drift-variance dramatically increased with age and was repressed by mianserin. Taken together, these results show that the RNA contamination from FUDR-treated eggs is minimal and that this residual amount does not influence our results."

(<b>e</b>) Distinct modes of lifespan extension: Proportional lifespan extension leads to a proportional extension across life whereas period-specific lifespan extension leads to a reduced rate of age-associated degeneration during a specific period only.

Animals were treated with water or mianserin on day 1 of adulthood, followed by treatment with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator paraquat on day 3, 5, or 10 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). On day 3 of adulthood, no difference in stress resistance between mianserin-treated and untreated animals was observed. As animals grew older (day 5 and day 10), mianserin treatment greatly improved stress resistance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>; <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Again, as with lifespan, delaying the start of mianserin treatment to day 3 and day 5 progressively reduced its protective effect on stress resistance, this time measured in animals subjected to paraquat on day 10 of adulthood (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>; <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Thus, mianserin treatment specifically improves stress resistance in older (day 5 and day 10) but not in younger (day 3) animals consistent with a model in which it preserves the homeostatic capacity of redox function."

Oliveira et al. identified 252 genes that were upregulated and 88 genes that were downregulated in young <i>C. elegans</i> in response to oxidative stress, and can therefore be considered an experimentally determined oxidative stress signature (<a href=\"#bib56\">Oliveira et al., 2009</a>). We hypothesized that a direct activation of the oxidative stress response by mianserin would mimic the increase in expression of the 252 genes and the decrease in the expression of the 88 genes as seen in response to oxidative stress. However, we observed an attenuation rather than an activation of the oxidative stress signatures, consistent with preserving homeostatic capacity rather than a direct activation. Genes that increased in response to oxidative stress (252) showed a lower expression while genes that decreased (88) in response to oxidative stress showed a higher expression in age-matched mianserin-treated animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). Consistent with the functional data, differences in the oxidative stress signature were only observed in older animals (day 5, 10), but not in younger day 3 animals. These results are consistent with a model in which mianserin treatment preserves the redox system from age-associated decline, thus improving redox capacity in older age."

We next asked whether preservation of redox capacity and reducing drift-variance in redox pathways by mianserin depends on serotonergic signaling. To identify the serotonergic receptor, we treated multiple mutants, each deficient in signaling by a single G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) with mianserin on day 1, followed by increasing concentrations of paraquat on day 5 to induce oxidative stress (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a>; <a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>).

Power calculations confirmed that these mortality curves were sufficiently powered to detect a one day difference in lifespan in over 90% of the experiments (\u03b1=0.01) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Ye et al., 2014</a>).

Alternatively, if mianserin still influenced mortality later in life, shorter exposures would lead to a shorter lifespan extension compared to a lifelong exposure. We therefore limited mianserin exposure to 8\u2009hr, 1, 5, 10 and 15 days and compared their lifespan with animals treated for the entire life (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c,d</a>). Exposing the animals for 5 or 10 days was sufficient to extend lifespan to the same extent as lifelong exposure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c,d</a>). Shorter exposures (8\u2009hr, 1 day) also extended lifespan, but not by as much, showing that removing mianserin from the culture is an effective means to restrict its action (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c,d</a>). Taken together, these results are most consistent with a model in which mianserin specifically lowers the rate of age-associated change during the first few days of adulthood, thereby extending their longevity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>) and postponing the onset of mortality. While the change in age-associated mortality rate during early adulthood is too small to be accuratly determined, when we measured drift-variance, it allowed us to monitor the age-associated change in the transcriptome during early adulthood (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e,f</a>)."

It is important to distinguish transcriptional noise, which measures the variance of the same genes among samples (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bahar et al., 2006</a>), from transcriptional drift, which measures variance among genes within the same samples. At present it is unclear whether transcriptional drift is the consequence of a regulated program or of degenerative changes in the nucleus that lead to a loss of transcriptional control.

The mortality levels of both cohorts (water, mianserin) are therefore identical at the start of the experiment. Thus, the lower mortality level observed on day 12 in mianserin-treated animals is the result of a lower mortality rate prior to day 12 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). Furthermore, mianserin ceases to affect mortality rates past day 12 as evident by highly parallel mortality curves (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). As with the results obtained with drift measurements, the most plausible explanation is that mianserin treatment specifically decelerates the rise in mortality in young adults leading to a lower mortality level sometime between day 10 to day 12 that persists throughout life, ultimately revealing itself in a 7\u20138 day lifespan extension (~30\u201340% increase in lifespan) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>)."

We further experimentally confirmed this suggestion by showing that treatment for the first five or ten days of life was necessary and sufficient to achieve the same lifespan extension observed with lifelong treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c,d</a>)."

Our data do not challenge any of these prior interpretations, but add a further possibility. Parallel shifts may also be brought about by a period extension in which the rate of age-associated physiological change is specifically lowered in young adults. Age-associated mortality in young adults is very low compared to extrinsic mortality factors and thus changes in age-associated mortality rates are difficult to reliably determine (<a href=\"#bib59\">Partridge and Gems, 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib8\">Beltran-Sancheza et al., 2012</a>). Specific changes in mortality rates during early adulthood therefore can go unnoticed but manifest themselves later as parallel shifts at the time when age-associated mortality levels are sufficiently high to be reliably determined. Whether the attenuation of physiological changes specific to young adults that affects later mortality, as seen for mianserin, is the equivalent of slowing aging in young adults is a debate for the general aging community."

We simply termed these changes \u2018transcriptional drift\u2019, to emphasize the ambiguity of these changes. These changes could either be the result of regulated changes as part of a biological program, or caused by a progressive loss of transcriptional control with age. Note that a progressive loss of transcriptional control does not necessarily have to result in random changes. A gene that is continuously activated in young animals may be less activated in older animals due to a progressive functional decline in the transcriptional machinery. Thus, a gradual loss of transcriptional control would cause an age-associated decline in expression of that gene in a non-random fashion. Conversely, repressive chromatin is lost with age leading to increases in transcription that are repressed in young animals. As most physiological processes depend at least to some degree on transcriptional regulation, we propose that expression changes of genes within the same pathway that go into opposing directions (<i>drift-variance increases</i>) are detrimental for the functionality of the pathway (as seen for redox pathways in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). These changes may also allow us to indirectly track the functional decline by measuring transcriptional drift."

Animals in cohort #1 were treated on day 1 with water (solvent) or 50 \u00b5M mianserin, and harvested on day 3, 5, and 10 of adulthood. Animals in cohort #2 were treated with water (solvent control) or mianserin (2, 10, or 50 \u00b5M) on day 1 of adulthood and harvested on day 5. Animals in cohort #3 were treated with water (solvent) or 50 \u00b5M mianserin on day 1, day 3 and day 5 and harvested on day 10 (See <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). RNA was also harvested from untreated day 1 adults, to obtain the \u201cyoung reference\u201d. Harvested animals were washed three times in ice cold Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffer saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen. A parallel lifespan assay was conducted for all cohorts to ensure mianserin action. Three biological replicates were harvested for every cohort. To extract RNA, frozen worms were re-suspended in ice-cold Trizol, zirconium beads, and glass beads (cat # 03961-1-103 and cat # 03961-1-104) in the ratio of 5:1:1 respectively, and disrupted in Precellys lysing system (6500 rpm, 3 x 10\u2009s cycles) followed by chloroform extraction. For RNA-seq, the extracted RNA was precipitated and purified further using Qiagen RNAeasy Mini kit columns (cat # 74104). RNA was precipitated using isopropanol and washed once with 75% ethanol. Integrity of the RNA was confirmed with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). To prepare the library, 100 ng of total RNA per sample was processed using NuGEN Encore Complete DR RNA-seq Prep Kit (NuGEN; San Carlos; CA, USA), as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The libraries were sequenced using v2 sequencing chemistry in a HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A single-read sequencing approach was used with 100 cycles, resulting in reads with a length of 100 nucleotides each. Libraries containing their own index sequences were sequenced in a multiplex manner by pooling six libraries per lane. Resulting sequences were obtained after 20\u201330 million reads per sample. Sequence data were extracted in FASTQ format and used for data analysis."

The amount of cleaved AMC fragments were quantified using TECAN xfluor safire II system at excitation of 360 nm and emission of 480 nm. The resulting readings were normalized to the total protein content in the samples measured using Bradford assay."

Each experiment consisted of 2 cohorts (water or 50 \u00b5M mianserin) and each cohort consisted of ~100 worms each amounting to ~1500 worms per condition. Power of detection was determined by Monte-Carlo simulations using a parametric model with parameters derived from our survival data of a cohort of over 5,026 N2 animals. The power of detection plot (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) shows the probability to detect a true lifespan extension with a significance level \u03b1=0.01 as a function of percent increase in lifespan for an experiment consisting of n animals. An accuracy of 1 day is the equivalent of a 5% increase in lifespan."

They assert that such data provide the first evidence that lifespan extension can be achieved by prolonging a specific period of life.

Most importantly, the ideas and hypotheses presented in the manuscript are not tested in a rigorous manner. The authors use predominantly descriptive data to support their own interpretation of the biology without asking whether they are also consistent with alternative interpretations. For example, the authors claim that if their measure of drift variance increases with age it is a sign of loss of homeostasis and of an increase in aging-related loss of transcriptional control. However, because the authors are examining among-gene variance (more on that below), this observation is also consistent with a model in which gene expression changes with age in a strongly regulated manner. Some genes may increase/decrease expression with age to promote reproduction, for example, or to modulate adult-specific behaviors. Even if such gene expression was regulated with 100% precision (i.e., reproducibly identical among individuals) then the variance in expression among genes will increase with age. Slowing the aging process (i.e., reducing the slope of that increase) would also reduce the rate of increase in drift-variance. This would occur without any specific youthful phase and completely in the absence of any sort of aging-related loss of transcriptional control. In other words, a model that is conceptually the opposite of the one proposed by the authors is consistent with many aspects of their observed data. There is no attempt or framework to distinguish this (and other) alternative hypotheses. For example, models of homeostasis can be separated from models of defined, aging-related changes by also examining variance within genes."

While this interpretation is consistent with the observations, so is a more parsimonious one; that increased time on mianserin increases stress resistance regardless of the age at which it is given. (See also other concerns, below, on mianserin experiments)."

These include evidence concerning proteostasis and stress response \"collapse\", as well as transcriptional changes, noise, and epigenetic alterations associated with age. Many of these changes occur during early adulthood in the worm. These findings are cited to an extent, but not comprehensively and not in a way that fully develops this idea. This is important because it is not clear whether transcriptional drift truly represents something new, or yet another parameter reflecting this regulatory decline. That doesn't mean the marker isn't useful, but it needs to be put into a more appropriate context in order to judge its significance."

However, a population measure is used, which confounds several influences. True biomarkers of aging must be defined at the level of the individual, and they are ideally based on rates of change across ages (repeated measures) and are validated by establishing that they predict remaining lifespan better than chronological time itself. Even if we accept this as a biomarker, the human data are confusing, where transcriptional drift variance doesn't appear to exhibit significant differences across test subjects until the age of 60 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Does this imply that humans are in their youthful state until 60? These data appear to undermine the notion that this measure is an evolutionary conserved bio-marker of aging."

If we accept drift variance as a biomarker of aging, all of the data appear to change relatively continuously throughout the measurement period. It is formally possible that if the authors' normalize gene expression to L2 data that age 1 day adults would have lots of \"drift.\" In other words, the work is lacking specific criteria upon which to define this hypothetical new youth stage. The lack of a clear definition for \"youth\" leads to confusion and ambiguity. For example, the authors state: \"Simply put, by chronological age of day 10, mianserin treated animals had yet to progress transcriptionally beyond the physiological age of day 3 [based on data in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>].\" However, they do not point out that mianserin treated individuals on day 10 have higher variance than they do on day 2 (even though they do have similar levels of variance seen in younger control populations), which implies that they have \"gotten worse\" over time. If we accept that they putatively remain in a youthful stage, then we must accept that they were hyper-youthful early on and that youth was subject to the same process of change in drift variance as aging. So how is this different from aging itself?"

Does transcriptional drift increase linearly, or does it plateau at a high level later in life, as the authors seem to suggest. If transcriptional drift mostly happens in early life, can this be reliably used as a biomarker of aging?"

As noted above, many parameters degenerate during early adulthood, but aging biomarkers become manifest later. Isn't it more likely that drift and other markers of gene expression changes reflect an early degeneration in control that will play out in its biological effects later, rather than a specific marker of \"aging\" in the young? To address this idea definitively, we would need to know whether other interventions have the same effect on transcriptional drift, or act on downstream or different parameters. Is mianserin unique, or is protecting the animal from this regulatory decline the most effective way to delay aging, and one that is seen in most contexts of long life?"

The idea of \"drift\" seems to be another manifestation of regulatory/homeostatic collapse, a phenomenon already described in various other ways\". We do not see direct evidence that transcriptional \"noise\" indeed arises from dysregulation and that it is a general phenomenon across the genome. Even in a case that \"drift\" represents loss of homeostasis or failure of transcriptional regulation rather than \"programmed\" expression pattern, we still have reservations in using the transcriptional drift as a bio-marker of aging. As stated above, conceptually, a bio-marker should have a predictive power of an individual and it is not clear how a metric that \"describes\" variance in a population can be considered a good way to predict an individual's physiological age. We are concerned that the idea of drift as elaborated in the manuscript has the potential to really muddy the waters when it comes to an already confusing body of literature that examines gene dysregulation with aging. At the very least, a discussion of this matter should be expanded to include a broader survey of the existing literature and a more rigorous analysis of the data that includes consideration of alternative models.

In addition to the eggs, reproduction itself is probably the most influential program that would change gene expression in young adults. Changes in developing eggs would account for a huge fraction of the transcriptional changes in the \"aging\" worms that have nothing to do with aging. The mianserin experiments were done with WT worms (and even FUdR would not change this point), so the authors need to seriously address this concern. That would be distinct from drift. If reproduction were somehow accounted for, we might be more willing to approach the authors' interpretation of the variance data. Even if reproduction is addressed, the notion of a specific effect on youth is still tenuous unless the authors show that an intervention that can affect aging late in life can affect \"drift\" at that point. So, the 'youth as a developmental stage' idea is not tenable, and this aspect is best left out, unless the issue of reproduction is addressed."

In addition to the eggs, reproduction itself is probably the most influential program that would change gene expression in young adults. Changes in developing eggs would account for a huge fraction of the transcriptional changes in the \"aging\" worms that have nothing to do with aging. The mianserin experiments were done with WT worms (and even FUdR would not change this point), so the authors need to seriously address this concern. That would be distinct from drift. If reproduction were somehow accounted for, we might be more willing to approach the authors' interpretation of the variance data. Even if reproduction is addressed, the notion of a specific effect on youth is still tenuous unless the authors show that an intervention that can affect aging late in life can affect \"drift\" at that point. So, the 'youth as a developmental stage' idea is not tenable, and this aspect is best left out, unless the issue of reproduction is addressed.</i> "

The plot consists of the \u201cwhiskers\u201d representing 1.5 x interquartile mean and the \u201cbox\u201d which represents the interquartile mean itself (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2E</a>). In other words, in a drift plot, the box represents the 50% of the transcriptome that changes least, while the whiskers represent the rest of the genes (50% without outliers) that change most (see PMID: 24645192 for details). Every drift plot in our manuscript in which drift changes with age shows that the change is present in the whiskers as well as in the box. Thus, drift is not driven by a few hundred genes that change extremely but is driven by thousands of changes distributed across the entire transcriptome. For the question of RNA from eggs, what this means is that even if we assume the worst possible scenario for our hypothesis that the eggs RNA is the RNA that changes more than any other RNA (in which case the whiskers would represent egg RNA), this would not be sufficient to alter the drift-variance across the entire sample. We chose the Tukey-style plots to avoid the situation where results are driven by extreme outliers or non-normal distributions (which are present in our datasets). Because drift is driven by thousands of gene changes, its results are extremely robust and don\u2019t change even if we introduce massive changes to the subsets of genes we analyze (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2F</a>). As we see a drift phenomenon even in the interquartile mean (50% of the transcriptome that changes least with age), drift is a global effect across the transcriptome (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2E</a>) and is resilient to sub-sampling (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2F</a>)."

Note that in this case, we remove all ubiquitously expressed genes like ribosomal, mitochondrial and similar genes that are present in both embryos and soma. Even though this operation removes only ~7,200 out of 19,196 individual genes, speaking in terms of total RNA, these ~7,200 genes account for 73% of the entire transcriptome in total counts. These genes belong to the class of mostly highly expressed genes. Despite this dramatic reduction in overall RNA, the remaining 11, 904 genes (mostly low expressing genes) again confirm that drift is increasing with age and that day 10 mianserin-treated animals show the same drift variance as day 3 untreated animals. The median expression increase seen in plot <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2G</a> is an artifact because most of the high expressing genes have been removed and the remaining low expressing genes cannot really decrease any further.

As AFD neurons are born before ASE and NSM neurons, these results suggested that none of these three neurons are present in FUDR-treated eggs (Sulston 1983). Gene-sets for genes that are highly enriched in these three neuron types (AFD, ASE, NSM) have been published (PMID17606643, 25372608).

If such a process occurs in young adults, it will lead to a higher mortality level by the onset of major mortality around mid-life. Thus, reducing the degenerative changes will extend lifespan but the effect will occur only if initiated during the specific period and the effect will be restricted to that period.

In a mortality plot a period-specific lifespan extension would lead to a lower mortality rate in young adults followed by a parallel shift in mortality levels at later ages. If period specific lifespan extensions exist, as we claim, why do mortality curves thus far failed to detect such an extension mechanism? The technical problem is that mortality curves are \u201cblind\u201d for the period of young adulthood (before day 10 in worms). The uncertainties in mortality levels and rates for young adults are too large to detect a deceleration of the age-associated mortality rate, for the following technical reasons: First, mortality curves cannot reliably measure changes in age-associated mortality rates in young adults, because the age-associated contribution of mortality is too small in relation to non-aging-associated mortality, i.e. accidental deaths (see below, Technical note). However, as remarked by others, it is important but difficult to separate aging-associated deaths from non-aging-associated deaths (PMID: 17994065). Non-aging-associated deaths pose a serious problem because in most cases it is nearly impossible to distinguish an accidental death from a death due to aging and even small mistakes will have an enormous influence. Using very high number of animals will not solve this problem as the number of non-aging-associated deaths will increase proportionally. Second, since age-associated mortality levels are so low in young adults, it is generally not possible to ascertain that two populations started out at the same mortality level. Thus different mortality levels observed later in life, when mortality levels are high enough to be determined reliably, could always be the consequence of different mortality levels at the start, rather than a change in mortality rates."

A lifespan assay makes no statement on when during the life of the animal this delay occurred.

Any difference in mortality levels between the two populations at a later time must therefore be due to different mortality rates. Such a statement for example can never be made when comparing mutants as it is always possible that mutations cause a different mortality level form the start due to slight alterations in development. A period extension model predicts that mianserin treatment will lower the mortality rate during the first few days of adulthood but not later, exerting an anti-aging effect during a specific period of life (young adulthood). This experimental design allows us to distinguish differences in age-associated mortality rates during young adulthood even though age-associated mortality levels at that age are too small to be directly measured (see Technical note for estimates and details)."

As both cohorts started at an unknown, but identical mortality level, the most plausible explanation is that mianserin lowered the mortality rate during the first 12 days of life leading to a lower mortality level as soon as mortality levels can be reliably measured (day 12). Furthermore, the parallel curves show that after day 12, mianserin has no effect on the mortality rate. Thus, lowering the mortality rate in young adults, without effects later, leads to a 7-8 day parallel shift in the lifespan curve. Mortality analysis, similar to drift-variance, shows that the 7-8 day shift in physiology, that ultimately causes a lifespan extension, is already present before the onset of major mortality in middle age (day 10, literally half the lifespan of 21 days),supporting the period-specific extension model."

In these studies, it becomes clear that mortality levels in humans before the age of 40 are not driven by age, but by extrinsic factors. This seems similar in worms. Our statement that <i>C. elegans</i> mortality levels before day 12 cannot be reliably quantified to detect changes in mortality rates is based on our data measuring lifespan for large cohorts (ranging 500 to 50,000 animals). From these data-sets, we estimate that there are generally 1: 1000 dead animals by day 1 of adulthood (e.g. 56 out of 54,688). Many of them, however, were unlikely to have died due to aging suggesting that the age-associated mortality rate on the first day of adulthood (day 1) is lower than 1:1000. Even around day 4, we find that mortality rates vary by several fold between experiments again suggesting that even the few deaths caused by extrinsic, non-aging factors (e.g. protruded vulvas) cause a dramatic variation. Our current best estimate for day 4 and 5 is a mortality rate of 0. 003 (3:1000). But again if only one of these 3 deaths is due to non-aging, the value is off by 33% and if two are, the value is off by a factor 3, making it impossible to distinguish different rates. Starting from day 12 the mortality levels between large cohorts of over 1000 animals become comparable. We found publications showing mortality curves that include values for young <i>C. elegans</i> adults, but none of these studies included confidence intervals nor any power of detection calculations. As these studies generally used lower number of animals compared to our larger cohorts, we have to assume that the errors for young adults inherent in published mortality curves are as substantial as the error in our curves."

We argue that a period extension model doesn\u2019t require a specific stage but only degenerative changes that occur during a restricted period throughout life. In the revised manuscript, we provide evidence that the mortality rate in early adulthood is decelerated in mianserin-treated animals as suggested by drift-analysis. We show that mianserin treatment is only required for a limited period of life. The conceptual novelty is that period extension is a class of lifespan-extending mechanisms that act within a defined beginning and an end and that mechanisms exist that specifically extend the duration of the period of early adulthood. Period extensions that extend the period of young adulthood have been missed, as age-associated mortality levels are very difficult to measure in young adults. We show that a deceleration of mortality rates early in adult life seizes before the onset of mortality. Period extensions provide an additional explanation on how parallel curve shifts in mortality curves arise and that the longevity effects do not have to act throughout life."

Subtracting all the changes caused by drift, leaves gene expression changes related to the xenobiotic response, innate immunity, stress and aging. Very consistently, these processes are regulated by serotonin and the likely primary response to mianserin. Murphy et.al, suggested a similar model, in that, <i>daf-16</i>, acts on aging by changing the expression of relatively few key physiological genes. The figure in 2G shows that changing the expression of a few key physiological genes by <i>daf-16</i> as shown in the original paper attenuates drift of thousands of age-associated changes (see Results section for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Drift was suppressed in many of the same genes (58% overlap) between <i>daf-2</i> and mianserin, consistent with chemical epistasis, showing that these two mechanisms overlap but are not identical (11% lifespan extension in <i>daf-2</i> instead of 31%, N2). It will be interesting to see whether other genetic epistasis experiments can also be explained on the basis of overlapping and non-overlapping sets of genes, whose age-associated drift-variance is attenuated."

Blocking hsf-1 activation is regulated, but the consequences are degenerative leading to inappropriate folding of proteins, aggregation and ultimately degeneration. The initial event is regulated; however, the consequences are not. In analogy, transcriptional-drift is the consequence of de-regulation in transcriptional control. The activation of transcription factors such as <i>daf-16</i> regulate longevity by acting on subsets of genes to preserve transcriptional control. Consider <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>. Even though <i>daf-2</i> RNAi leads to the activation of <i>daf-16</i> and an entire anti-aging program as shown previously, drift becomes smaller. Compared to the number of genes that change expression due to activation of <i>daf-16</i> (drift should increase), the number of genes that change less due to age is much more.

Mianserin treatment prevents early degeneration occurring in young animals, lowering the age-associated mortality rate when the animals reach middle age. Thus, it is almost how the reviewer says it is. There is early degeneration that becomes apparent in mortality later. But, the only reason it becomes apparent later is the inability of mortality analysis to measure aging in young animals. The mortality rate is rising in young adults and mianserin is preventing the rise but the number of deaths is simply too low to reliably determine differences in mortality rates at the early adulthood. If it were possible to measure mortality, one would see that mianserin decelerated the mortality rate in young animals up to around day 10 to 12 and then stops doing so. However, drift analysis and some of the experiments we added reveal that. Without monitoring transcriptional drift, a period extension mechanism decelerating aging in young animals is invisible until mortality is high enough to be measured. However, by that time the period extension process is over and the only signature left behind is a parallel shift in mortality curves, which has been previously interpreted as non-aging. That interpretation is correct regarding many experiments (e.g. experiments involving radiation for example (PMID25750242). However as our data show, a parallel shift can also indicate that the slowing of the aging rate occurred at a time before mortality can be reliably measured. Therefore, \u201cmianserin specifically slows aging during early adulthood\u201d seems like a stretch because we and others have been unable to detect it thus far, before the development of the drift metric."

How might these affect \"drift\", or vice-versa? Does mianserin affect these parameters? How can claims be made about effects on aging early in life without considering this biology? It is either disingenuous or na\u00efve to describe young adulthood in terms of a period of aging while ignoring the biological events that are occurring, particularly the cessation of reproduction.</i> Thank you for pointing this out. We have considered the aspects of germline biology scientifically while designing our study, but did not mention it because our previously published results seemed to exclude the involvement of the germline. One reason to analyze the Murphy et al., 2003 data as well as data from non-reproductive tissues in mice and humans was to ensure that fertility is not the driving factor behind drift. We now remedied our lapse and provide extensive data that show that FUDR sterilization or fertility does not affect drift (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>) and address the germline further in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G and 6H</a>. We also mention in the text that the fact that mianserin extends lifespan of <i>daf-16</i> but not of <i>eat-2</i> (Petrascheck, 2007) made us discount a direct germline-related lifespan extension early on. To further establish this, we have now included data showing that mianserin does not increase proteasome activity as seen in <i>glp-1</i> mutants and that mianserin does not increase the reproductive lifespan in contrast to <i>tph-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G and 6H</a>). We hope we have now amended what we failed to do the first time around."

This analysis however showed a very complex and convoluted picture that was dramatically simplified by accounting for drift. Because the initial analysis was rather disappointing to us, we did not include it in the first version. However, we see that it is necessary to justify the reasons why we dramatically deviated from standard methods of analyses. Using the Murphy et al., data we show a 58% overlap in genes whose age-associated changes are reversed in both, mianserin-treated as well as <i>daf-2</i> RNAi treated animals (See Results section for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This overlap is consistent with the fact that mianserin extends lifespan of <i>daf-2</i> mutants but only by ~11% rather than the ~31% seen in the parallel N2 experiment. We were unable to find published dietary restriction transcriptome data that monitored differences across different ages to conduct a similar comparison."

Mianserin does extend lifespan of <i>daf-2</i> mutants but not as much as in N2. As 58% of the genes are already attenuated by <i>daf-2</i> alone mianserin only adds to the anti-aging affect by attenuating an additional 42%, thus causing an increase in lifespan in <i>daf-2</i> animals that is a bit less than half what it does in N2(See results section for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). The same scenario is true for serotonin receptors. Serotonin affects different responses by different receptors. Note that in both, <i>ser-4</i> and <i>ser-5</i> mutants, mianserin still has some residual effect on lifespan suggesting independent functions. We show that SER-5 is specifically required for mianserin to induce stress resistance and to attenuate drift in the redox system. In the revised manuscript, we further show that SER-3 nor SER-4 are neither required for stress resistance nor for attenuating drift in redox genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Our model suggests that this is because these receptors attenuate drift of different subsets of genes. Thus, we should be able to dissociate which receptor causes transcriptional drift for which cellular process. If our model in which repeated activation of a transcriptional program causes drift is correct, then each of these receptors required for lifespan effect will cause drift in specific subset of genes it activates, when stimulated by serotonin or octopamine. For now, we provide evidence for the correlation between drift attenuation and redox function preservation by Mianserin via SER-5."

Interestingly, the set of genes whose drift is attenuated by mianserin and <i>daf-2</i> with age overlap by 58% (see Results section for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Thus, the overlap of drift-attenuation fits exactly the partial lifespan extension we have reported previously. Similar to this, it will be interesting to learn whether genetic epistasis can be explained by the overlap of genes whose drift is reversed."
