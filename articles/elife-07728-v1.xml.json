We show that Munc13, an active-zone protein essential for exocytosis, also controls presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel function dictating their behavior during various forms of activity. We demonstrate that in vitro Munc13 interacts with voltage-gated calcium channels via a pair of basic residues in Munc13's C2B domain. We show that elimination of this interaction by either removal of Munc13 or replacement of Munc13 with a Munc13 C2B mutant alters synaptic VGCC's response to and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts and alters calcium influx from single action potential stimuli. These studies illustrate a novel form of synaptic modulation and show that Munc13 is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis."
