                    "text": "The diverse transcriptional mechanisms governing cellular differentiation and development of mammalian tissue remains poorly understood. Here we report that TAF7L, a paralogue of TFIID subunit TAF7, is enriched in adipocytes and white fat tissue (WAT) in mouse. Depletion of TAF7L reduced adipocyte-specific gene expression, compromised adipocyte differentiation, and WAT development as well. Ectopic expression of TAF7L in myoblasts reprograms these muscle precursors into adipocytes upon induction. Genome-wide mRNA-seq expression profiling and ChIP-seq binding studies confirmed that TAF7L is required for activating adipocyte-specific genes via a dual mechanism wherein it interacts with PPAR\u03b3 at enhancers and TBP/Pol II at core promoters. In vitro binding studies confirmed that TAF7L forms complexes with both TBP and PPAR\u03b3. These findings suggest that TAF7L plays an integral role in adipocyte gene expression by targeting enhancers as a cofactor for PPAR\u03b3 and promoters as a component of the core transcriptional machinery."

Here we report that TAF7L, a paralogue of TFIID subunit TAF7, is enriched in adipocytes and white fat tissue (WAT) in mouse. Depletion of TAF7L reduced adipocyte-specific gene expression, compromised adipocyte differentiation, and WAT development as well. Ectopic expression of TAF7L in myoblasts reprograms these muscle precursors into adipocytes upon induction. Genome-wide mRNA-seq expression profiling and ChIP-seq binding studies confirmed that TAF7L is required for activating adipocyte-specific genes via a dual mechanism wherein it interacts with PPAR\u03b3 at enhancers and TBP/Pol II at core promoters. In vitro binding studies confirmed that TAF7L forms complexes with both TBP and PPAR\u03b3. These findings suggest that TAF7L plays an integral role in adipocyte gene expression by targeting enhancers as a cofactor for PPAR\u03b3 and promoters as a component of the core transcriptional machinery."

The formation of adipocytes, a process known as adipogenesis, has been extensively studied, but there remain major gaps in our knowledge: for example, the identities of many of the transcriptional regulators that are responsible for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes remain a mystery. This task is complicated by the fact that some of these regulators are involved in the differentiation of multiple cell lines, and that some of them also have multiple roles in the generation of a single cell type. In addition to being of fundamental interest, improving our knowledge of the properties and behavior of adipocytes is essential for tackling the increasing prevalence of obesity in the developed world."

Using a combination of cellular, biochemical, genetic and genomic techniques, they show that TAF7L interacts with PPAR\u03b3, an important adipocyte transcriptional regulator at enhancer sites on the genome to increase the transcription of genes that are involved in adipogenesis. They also show that TAF7L interacts with a general transcription factor called TBP (short for TATA-binding protein) at promoter sequences, again to increase the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis. Moreover, they show that the expression of TAF7L in myoblasts\u2014precursor cells that usually become muscle cells\u2014can induce the formation of fat cells rather than muscle cells. Furthermore, mice lacking TAF7L are lean compared to their normal littermates. A clearer understanding of the underlying causes of fat cell formation could lead to the development of new approaches for the treatment of obesity and associated diseases."

Other transcription factors and cofactors, such as KLF15, KLF9, MED1, MED14, MED15, MED23 and TAF8, have also been reported to be involved in either adipocyte commitment or differentiation in model cell lines (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guermah et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mori et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Matsumoto et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gr\u00f8ntved et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pei et al., 2011</a>).

The diversity of factors and the mechanisms driving adipocyte formation and cellular differentiation in general remain a challenge. For example, several tissue-specific components of the core transcriptional machinery were recently found to play essential roles in directing cell type-specific programs of transcription and lineage-specific differentiation. The examples of these include TAF4b which was found to be a key component in the development of the mouse ovary and spermatogenesis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freiman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Voronina et al., 2007</a>), and TAF3 which was found to be required for mouse germ-layer differentiation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, a TRF3/TAF3 complex was found to be important for mouse myogenesis and zebrafsh hematopoiesis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hart et al., 2009</a>). As increasing numbers of cell type- and tissue-specific components of the core machinery become better characterized, a somewhat different notion of how traditional sequence\u2013specific enhancer binding factors cooperate with selective tissue-specific core factors to drive lineage-specific transcription programs has emerged (<a href=\"#bib8\">D'Alessio et al., 2009</a>). With respect to adipogenesis, the only hint of such a mechanism came from previous studies of TAF8, which was reported as a component of TFIID implicated in adipocyte formation using 3T3-L1 cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guermah et al., 2003</a>). Whether TAF8 operates exclusively as a subunit of TFIID or participates in other molecular transactions, in addition to its in vivo function, remain unknown."

In addition, we have explored the consequences of ectopically expressing TAF7L in C2C12 myoblasts to probe its reprogramming capabilities. Further, we carried out genome-wide mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis to survey its functions in adipocyte differentiation. By using a combination of cellular, biochemical, genetic, and genomic approaches, our findings suggest that TAF7L plays an integral role in adipocyte gene expression by targeting enhancers as a cofactor for PPAR\u03b3 and promoters as a component of the core transcriptional machinery, therefore providing new molecular insights into fat development that may prove useful for developing therapeutic strategies to treat obesity and its associated diseases."

In particular, we set out to determine whether and which TAF subunits of the prototypic core promoter recognition complex TFIID increase or decrease in expression during adipocyte differentiation. Consistent with the previous observations from 3T3-L1 adipogenesis studies (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guermah et al., 2003</a>), our analysis of both protein and mRNA levels revealed that TBP and most of the canonical subunits of TFIID are down-regulated during C3H10T1/2 differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Surprisingly however, one subunit (TAF7L) previously reported to be a component of TFIID primarily in testis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pointud et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cheng et al., 2007</a>) was found to be significantly up-regulated in differentiated C3H10T1/2 adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>). Importantly, this enrichment appears specific for the adipogenesis process since the mRNA abundance of <i>Taf7l</i> is downregulated to levels comparable to those of other TAF subunits during myogenesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To exclude the possibility that <i>Taf7l</i> enrichment reflects a cell culture artifact of C3H10T1/2 adipogenesis, we compared <i>Taf7l</i> mRNA and protein levels in bona fide mouse tissue. In concordance with previous studies, <i>Taf7l</i> is most highly expressed in testis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pointud et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Importantly, <i>Taf7l</i> also shows significant expression in WAT and detectable expression in liver, spleen, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and kidney, but not in muscle or brain tissue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). By contrast, the expression of canonical TFIID subunits such as TAF4 is low in both WAT and muscle as expected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that TAF7L is indeed enriched in differentiated C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes and bona fide WAT."

Second, although earlier studies of terminal differentiation implicated specific \u2018atypical TAFs\u2019 in, for example, skeletal muscle, ovary and testis formation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freiman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Deato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">D'Alessio et al., 2009</a>), we did not anticipate <i>Taf7l</i> as a potential key player in adipogenesis.

As shown by Western blot, shTAF7L significantly reduced TAF7L protein levels both pre- and more dramatically post-adipogenesis while levels of canonical TFIID subunits remained largely unaltered in control and TAF7L knockdown pre-adipogenesis cultures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, pre-). Consistent with our previous observation in terminally differentiated cells, the protein levels of the canonical TFIID subunits become largely decreased in control post-adipogenesis cultures while cells that have been depleted of TAF7L and therefore blocked from differentiation show high levels of TFIID subunits. As expected, PPAR\u03b3 levels increased in control shGFP cells post induction but showed markedly reduced levels in shTAF7L-treated cells suggesting that TAF7L may directly or indirectly regulate this key adipogenic transcription factor. Our results also suggest that shTAF7L efficiently reduced endogenous TAF7L levels and blocked adipogenesis without significantly affecting TFIID complex integrity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, post-). Next, C3H10T1/2 cells stably treated with shTAF7L and control shGFP were subjected to Oil red O staining to determine the efficiency of adipogenesis. Very few lipid-laden adipocytes formed in TAF7L depleted C3H10T1/2 cells, whereas over 98% of shGFP-treated cells differentiated into mature adipocytes. The few adipocytes that formed in shTAF7L-treated cells appeared smaller and exhibited abnormal morphology compared to untreated or shGFP-treated C3H10T1/2 adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E</a>). These results suggest that TAF7L knockdown largely compromised the adipogenic potential of C3H10T1/2 cells, thus functionally implicating TAF7L in adipocyte differentiation."

The TAF7LmA expression vector contains two silent mutations in <i>Taf7l</i> cDNA which renders resistance to RNA-mediated silencing by shTAF7L. As revealed by Western blot, TAF7LmA is efficiently expressed in shTAF7L cells, similar to the TAF7 construct (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Next, we induced adipogenesis followed by Oil red O staining 5 days post induction. Our results indicate that introduction of TAF7LmA restored adipocyte formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) and elevated expression of adipocyte-specific genes compared to vector control in shTAF7L cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In contrast, overexpression of TAF7 failed to restore the adipogenic defects caused by the loss of TAF7L (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Collectively, these results support the notion that TAF7L is likely an important player in adipogenesis, at least in the C3H10T1/2 cell differentiation model."

Importantly, genes normally up-regulated following adipogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, shown in orange) showed similarly low expression levels in induced shTAF7L cells as in pre-adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, orange). Strikingly, 2083 out of 2360 genes (88%) that are highly upregulated during adipocyte differentiation failed to be induced upon adipogenic induction in the absence of TAF7L (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). RT-qPCR analysis of several representative marker genes confirmed that TAF7L knockdown dramatically reduced their mRNA levels compared to control shGFP in post-adipogenesis cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data suggest that the induction of adipocyte-specific genes is markedly compromised in the absence of TAF7L. Moreover, the overall transcriptional profile of differentiated shTAF7L-treated C3H10T1/2 cells (shTAF7L-post) largely matched the expression levels of pre-differentiated C3H10T1/2 cells (10T1/2-pre) (R = 0.98) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>); while mature adipocytes (10T1/2-post) is distinct (R = 0.84) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Thus, loss of TAF7L in C3H10T1/2 cells severely impaired its adipogenic potential rendering shTAF7L-treated cells in an undifferentiated state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B and 3A,B</a>). These findings were also confirmed using a different shTAF7L construct and RT-qPCR analysis (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly implicate TAF7L in potentiating efficient adipogenesis of C3H10T1/2 cells by serving as an important regulator of adipocyte-specific gene expression."

For instance, transdifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into adipocytes by ectopic expression of PPAR\u03b3 and/or C/EBPa under adipogenic permissive conditions helped establish these sequence-specific enhancer binding factors as key regulators of adipogenesis (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tontonoz et al., 1994a</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">1994b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kajimura et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, we tested the adipogenic function of TAF7L by an analogous \u2018gain of function\u2019 approach with forced introduction of TAF7L or control vector into C2C12 myoblasts. First, we generated TAF7L-expressing (C2C12.TAF7L) or control C2C12 (C2C12.CNTL) stable cell lines by transfecting either FLAG-TAF7L or empty vector followed by neomycin selection. As detected by FLAG antibody through Western blot analysis, C2C12.TAF7L stable cells achieved modestly elevated expression levels of FLAG-TAF7L protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Similarly, C2C12.TAF7L cells express roughly eightfold higher <i>Taf7l</i> mRNA levels than C2C12.CNTL cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Next, we treated both C2C12.TAF7L and C2C12.CNTL stable cell lines with the four standard adipogenic inducers for 5 days and then applied Oil red O staining. A large proportion of C2C12.TAF7L cells developed into lipid-laden cells while no detectable C2C12.CNTL cells produced lipid droplets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR confirmed that C2C12.TAF7L cells have markedly increased mRNA levels of a subset of adipocyte-specific genes including <i>Adipsin</i>, <i>Resistin</i>, <i>Ppar\u03b3</i>, <i>C</i>/<i>EBP\u03b1</i>, <i>Adipoq</i> and <i>Fabp4</i> relative to C2C12.CNTL cells post differentiation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,C,E,F</a>). By contrast, myoblast-gene <i>Myf5</i> is downregulated in C2C12.TAF7L cells prior to and post adipogenic induction (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Furthermore, we performed mRNA-seq on differentiated C2C12.TAF7L and C2C12.CNTL cells and these genome-wide expression studies revealed that indeed, a number of adipocyte-specific genes become highly upregulated in C2C12.TAF7L cells compared to C2C12.CNTL cells post adipogenesis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Gene ontology analysis of genes upregulated fivefold or more in differentiated C2C12.TAF7L cells vs C2C12.CNTL cells indicated that \u223c32% of these genes are involved in either adipocyte differentiation or function. Notably, in accordance with the role of <i>Taf7l</i> in spermatogenesis that was reported previously, \u223c10% of these up-regulated genes are involved in spermatogenesis and sexual reproduction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that ectopic expression of TAF7L in C2C12 myoblasts, even at modestly elevated levels, is capable of inducing upregulation of <i>Taf7l</i> itself and other important adipogenic transcription factors including <i>Ppar\u03b3</i> and <i>C</i>/<i>ebp\u03b1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>) thereby reprogramming a significant portion of C2C12 cells into adipocytes upon induction (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>), providing further evidence for TAF7L as a pro-adipogenic regulator."

We then validated our ChIP-seq data by comparing our new data with published ChIP-seq data for PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1, and RXR\u03b1 in 3T3-L1 derived adipocytes 6 days post-differentiation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schmidt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Waki et al., 2011</a>). This extensive analysis revealed that the majority of PPAR\u03b3 binding sites we mapped overlap with those previously reported although some differences in specific binding sites were observed, likely due to inherent differences between 3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 cells. A direct comparison of TAF7L and PPAR\u03b3 genome-wide binding profiles revealed that 26% of TAF7L peaks were co-occupied by PPAR\u03b3 and reciprocally, 37% of PPAR\u03b3 peaks were co-bound by TAF7L (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>). Similarly, TAF7L binds to 20% of RXR\u03b1 bound loci genome-wide. Moreover, TAF7L also co-localizes with 25% of C/EBP\u03b1 binding and vice versa. Collectively, these findings provide indirect evidence for a functional association between TAF7L and adipogenic activators PPAR\u03b3, RXR\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b1 in adipocytes. Indeed, the relationship between TAF7L, PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1 and TBP/Pol II at a genome-wide scale suggests that TAF7L might also functions as an enhancer-associated co-activator that connects adipogenic activators with the core promoter recognition machinery to potentiate adipocyte differentiation."

First, we constructed TAF7L, TBP and PPAR\u03b3 with either FLAG or HA Tags for expression in 293T cells in pair-wise combinations. Next, we performed co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP) between PPAR\u03b3, TAF7L and TBP with either FLAG or HA antibodies, followed by Western blot analysis to detect the FLAG- or HA-tagged proteins. Intriguingly, these co-IP assays showed that PPAR\u03b3 can efficiently pull down TAF7L and vice versa with (data not shown) or without the addition of PPAR\u03b3 ligand rosiglitozone (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>); by contrast, PPAR\u03b3 was unable to co-IP TBP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). As expected, TAF7L and TBP can pull down each other reciprocally (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>), which is consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pointud et al., 2003</a>). To confirm that the association between TAF7L and PPAR\u03b3 or TBP is direct and not mediated via DNA/chromatin interactions, we included benzonase treatment in our co-IP assays. Eliminating DNA in these co-IP experiments did not alter the binding interactions we observed between TAF7L and PPAR\u03b3 or TBP (data now shown). As expected, over-expression of TAF7L in C3H10T1/2 cells and adipocytes allows co-IP of other endogenous TFIID subunits including TBP and TAF4 (data not shown), suggesting that some tagged-TAF7L can integrate into native TFIID complexes. Taken together, these protein:protein binding assays suggest that TAF7L can physically associate with both PPAR\u03b3 and TBP/TFIID either directly or indirectly via presently unidentified protein factors. These studies provide a potential mechanism by which TAF7L may serve as a cofactor linking specific adipogenic activators, proximal enhancers and the core transcription apparatus."

ASCs resemble mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in terms of their ability to differentiate into multiple lineages including adipocytes, myotubes, osteocytes, and cartilage under appropriate developmental cues (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gornostaeva et al., 2006</a>). Given that increased numbers of adipocytes, a major underlying cause of obesity, are primarily derived from MSCs and/or ASCs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bowers and Lane, 2008</a>), we chose C3H10T1/2 MSCs as our cell culture model system for studying adipogenesis in large measure because MSCs efficiently recapitulate aspects of adipocyte differentiation and in vivo fat development. Using this MSC culture model as well as <i>Taf7l</i> KO mouse model for our in vitro and in vivo studies, we unexpectedly identified <i>Taf7l</i> as a key regulator of adipogenesis; adding a new piece of the molecular puzzle to the critically important regulators of fat development in mammalian organisms. We found the effect of <i>Taf7l</i> in adipogenesis to be quite robust wherein its loss led to extensive down-regulation of genome-wide adipocyte-specific gene expression in cell culture and defects in WAT development in vivo. We are particularly intrigued by the manner in which TAF7L seems to operate\u2013serving both as an integral component of TFIID at the core promoter and as a key co-activator interacting directly with PPAR\u03b3 or other adipocyte-specific transcriptional factors (ATFs) at proximal enhancers of adipocyte-specific genes on genome-wide scale (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Thus, a hitherto unrecognized cell-type selective core regulator with an apparent dual mechanism of action has been identified that influences the pro-adipogenic transcriptional control network. It is conceivable that TAF7L and associated regulatory factors in this newly discovered pathway may reveal potentially useful therapeutic drug targets to combat obesity and its related diseases."

Indeed, even after being clued into the potential contribution of <i>Taf7l</i> in fat tissue development, our analysis of <i>Taf7l</i> KO mice mainly revealed defects in WAT formation at certain stages of development and there were no gross, easily-observable morphological abnormalities in young animals except when the underlying fat pads were dissected for direct inspection to reveal the partial penetrance of the lean phenotype. Also, previous studies had no reason to examine the expression of <i>Taf7l</i> in adipose tissue because <i>Taf7l</i> mRNA and protein levels are relatively low in adipose tissue compared with testis. We also note that although TAF7L protein levels become highly elevated when MSCs differentiate into adipocytes, its mRNA levels increase only modestly (\u223c2\u00d7) compared to typical adipocyte marker genes such as <i>Fabp4</i> and <i>Glut4</i> during adipogensis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kajimura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Seale et al., 2008</a>). It is therefore not surprising that a role for <i>Taf7l</i> in adipocytes could have been overlooked in previous studies. This cautionary tale also suggests that other key transcriptional regulators could likewise go undetected; suggesting that more studies will likely be required to take a fuller accounting of the multiple factor combinations that have evolved to orchestrate the diversity of gene regulatory pathways during differentiation and development of metazoans."

Another possible link involved steroid hormones (i.e. testosterone), which are essential for spermatogenesis, are derived from cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chowdhury and Mukherjee, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mahmoud et al., 1985</a>). In any case, our genome-wide mRNA-seq expression analysis unambiguously identified <i>Taf7l</i>-mediated enrichment of genes involved in both adipogenesis and reproductive processes. However, further investigation will be required to assess whether there are more direct links between adipogenesis and spermatogenesis and whether mutant <i>Taf7l</i> involved in male infertility also disturbs normal fat development and metabolism."

However, our incipient attempts failed to pinpoint significant defects in interscapular BAT formation in <i>Taf7l</i> KO mice. Thus, future studies will be required to determine whether <i>Taf7l</i> is also involved in BAT development. Further, our preliminary attempts to measure metabolic functions suggest that <i>Taf7l</i>-deficient mice showed changed serum glucose levels after 24 hr fasting compared with control WT littermates, it will be interesting to explore whether and how T<i>af7l</i> KO alters energy metabolism. Therefore, further detailed investigations will be required to more rigorously delineate the potential function of <i>Taf7l</i> in energy homeostasis."

Second, we applied the Grizzly peak fitting algorithm (<a href=\"#bib26\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>), which uses a model-based iterative approach to accurately identify multiple binding loci at every enriched region. Peaks were then associated with the nearest TSS (using gene annotation from UCSC, version mm9), and classified as promoter peaks (up to 500 bp from start site), proximal enhancer peaks (larger than 500 bp and less than 5 kb), distal enhancer peaks (less than 50 kb from TSS), or none (further away than any start site)."
