DOI: 10.7554/eLife.03722(Hermundstad et al., 2014)). Building on these results, we use single-unit recordings in the macaque monkey to determine where these computations - sensitivity to specific multipoint correlations - occur. We find that these computations take place in visual area V2, primarily in its supragranular layers. The demonstration that V2 neurons are sensitive to the multipoint correlations that are informative about natural images provides a common computational underpinning for diverse but well-recognized aspects of neural processing in V2, including its sensitivity to corners, junctions, illusory contours, figure/ground, and 'naturalness.'"
