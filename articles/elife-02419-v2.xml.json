                    "text": "The construction of cilia and flagella depends on intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bidirectional movement of two protein complexes (IFT-A and IFT-B) driven by specific kinesin and dynein motors. IFT-B and kinesin are associated to anterograde transport whereas IFT-A and dynein participate to retrograde transport. Surprisingly, the small GTPase IFT27, a member of the IFT-B complex, turns out to be essential for retrograde cargo transport in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>. We reveal that this is due to failure to import both the IFT-A complex and the IFT dynein into the flagellar compartment. To get further molecular insight about the role of IFT27, GDP- or GTP-locked versions were expressed in presence or absence of endogenous IFT27. The GDP-locked version is unable to enter the flagellum and to interact with other IFT-B proteins and its sole expression prevents flagellum formation. These findings demonstrate that a GTPase-competent IFT27 is required for association to the IFT complex and that IFT27 plays a role in the cargo loading of the retrograde transport machinery."

IFT-B and kinesin are associated to anterograde transport whereas IFT-A and dynein participate to retrograde transport. Surprisingly, the small GTPase IFT27, a member of the IFT-B complex, turns out to be essential for retrograde cargo transport in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>. We reveal that this is due to failure to import both the IFT-A complex and the IFT dynein into the flagellar compartment. To get further molecular insight about the role of IFT27, GDP- or GTP-locked versions were expressed in presence or absence of endogenous IFT27. The GDP-locked version is unable to enter the flagellum and to interact with other IFT-B proteins and its sole expression prevents flagellum formation. These findings demonstrate that a GTPase-competent IFT27 is required for association to the IFT complex and that IFT27 plays a role in the cargo loading of the retrograde transport machinery."

IFT27 is part of the IFT-B complex, and so it was thought to only affect how flagella grow. However, short flagella still grow when IFT27 is absent, but they are filled with IFT trains that are not able to reverse back from the tip. Huet et al. reveal that the IFT-A complex and the molecular motor that is essential for reversing the train are not transported into the flagellum if IFT27 is not present. This is therefore an unusual case of an IFT-B protein affecting the IFT-A complex and the transport back to the base."

This means that if IFT27 is locked in an inactive state, the IFT-B complex does not form, and a flagellum cannot grow. Therefore, activated IFT27 is needed for putting together the IFT train and to ensure its movement in either direction along the microtubule tracks."

These organelles are found protruding at the surface of a wide range of eukaryotic cells where they exert several roles including cellular motility, sensory reception and developmental signaling (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fliegauf et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Drummond, 2012</a>). Although cilia and flagella can differ by their functions, they share the same basic structure and are mainly assembled by an evolutionary conserved process called intraflagellar transport (IFT) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kozminski et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</a>). During IFT, large protein complexes called IFT trains are moved from the base to the tip of the flagellum by kinesin-2 (anterograde IFT) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kozminski et al., 1995</a>) and back towards the base by cytoplasmic dynein-1b/2 (retrograde IFT) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pazour et al., 1998</a>). The IFT particles are composed of at least 20 different proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cole et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Follit et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Taschner et al., 2011</a>) and can be divided in two different complexes known as complex A (made of at least 6 proteins) and B (made of at least 14 proteins) that are needed for retrograde and anterograde IFT respectively. Inactivation of IFT-B proteins or of the kinesin motor results in the failure to construct the flagellum whereas IFT-A proteins and the IFT dynein contribute to retrograde transport. Nevertheless, little is known about how the two processes are interconnected, as the interaction between the IFT complexes and their molecular motors is still poorly understood."

However, two IFT proteins belonging to the IFT complex B do not share those features. Instead, they exhibit sequence homologies with the family of Rab-like small G proteins, which can function to regulate vesicle movement along actin and tubulin networks (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stenmark, 2009</a>). This suggests that they could be involved in IFT regulation. The first one, IFT22 (or Rab-like 5) traffics inside the sensory neurons of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, where its disruption does not affect cilia assembly but produces an intriguing extended lifespan phenotype (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schafer et al., 2006</a>). IFT22 also undergoes IFT in the flagellum of the protist <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> but surprisingly knocking down the protein resulted in severe flagellar assembly defects, typical of inhibition of retrograde transport (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adhiambo et al., 2009</a>). In <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, IFT22 regulates the availability of IFT proteins inside the cell (<a href=\"#bib55\">Silva et al., 2012</a>). Despite being homologous to the Rab-like proteins, IFT22 lacks the G4 domain needed for recognition of the guanine base (<a href=\"#bib36\">Paduch et al., 2001</a>) and GTP binding and hydrolysis has not been demonstrated to date. Therefore, IFT22 might have diverged from its ancestral GTPase function to complete specific roles in <i>C. elegans</i>, <i>T. brucei</i>, and <i>Chlamydomonas</i>."

Structurally, the protein is similar to Rab8 and Rab11 and is capable of GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhogaraju et al., 2011</a>). IFT27 is part of the IFT complex B core, where the protein interacts directly with IFT25 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lucker et al., 2005</a>). This IFT25/27 sub-complex is associated with the rest of the IFT complex B prior to flagellum entry, suggesting a possible regulatory role during the entry of the IFT machinery (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). In <i>Chlamydomonas,</i> RNAi-mediated knockdown of IFT27 causes flagellar defects (<a href=\"#bib43\">Qin et al., 2007</a>), supporting its role during flagellar assembly, although its exact contribution was not investigated. In this study, we analyzed the function of IFT27 in <i>T. brucei,</i> the parasite that causes sleeping sickness and that is also an amenable model to study flagellar assembly (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kohl and Bastin, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ralston and Hill, 2008</a>) as well as the IFT components (<a href=\"#bib2\">Absalon et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Adhiambo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Franklin and Ullu, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buisson et al., 2013</a>). We found that IFT27 travels by IFT and associates with other IFT-B proteins<i>.</i> RNAi knockdown surprisingly produced short flagella filled with IFT-like material and axoneme assembly defects. This phenotype is explained by the absence of both the IFT140 protein (a member of the IFT-A complex) and the IFT dynein motor from the flagellar compartment. Generation of constitutively active and inactive forms of IFT27 produced further insights: while expression of the active version of the protein complements the RNAi phenotype, this was not the case of the inactive version that was unable to penetrate the flagellar compartment. Surprisingly, its expression in the absence of endogenous protein led to the formation of short flagella that do not accumulate IFT-like material. This inactive version is unable to interact with two other IFT-B proteins, suggesting that IFT27 must be in a GTP-bound state in order to interact with the B-complex and enter the flagellum. These results show that IFT27, an IFT-B protein, performs two separate functions: one in the import of both the IFT-A complex and IFT dynein motors and one in the assembly of the IFT-B complex."

Second, a GFP::IFT27 fusion protein was expressed in procyclic trypanosomes. Western blot analyses using the anti-IFT27 antibody showed a single band migrating at a position close to the predicted size of 20 kDa in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In trypanosomes expressing the GFP::IFT27 fusion, the same antibody detected an additional band migrating close to the 50 kDa marker. This molecular weight is compatible with the expected mass of the fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The anti-IFT27 antibody was then used in immunofluorescence assays in combination with DAPI to stain both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, the latter being an easy marker of basal body positioning in trypanosomes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Robinson and Gull, 1991</a>). In wild-type cells, the anti-IFT27 antibody produced a signal all along the flagellum, starting at the base of the organelle and reaching its distal tip where it was sometimes brighter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The GFP-fusion protein showed a similar localization, with the presence of the protein at the flagellum base and inside the flagellum. Co-staining of the GFP-tagged protein and IFT27 showed a clear colocalization inside the flagellum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and the use of live microscopy demonstrated that the fusion protein clearly traffics along the flagellum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) where typical bidirectional IFT was visualized. Similar IFT trafficking was observed for other IFT-related proteins in trypanosomes including GFP::IFT52 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Absalon et al., 2008b</a>), GFP::IFT22 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adhiambo et al., 2009</a>), and YFP::IFT81 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</a>). Kymographs were made to quantify IFT train speed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The mean anterograde velocity was 2.5 \u00b1 0.68 \u00b5m/s (n = 234) and mean retrograde velocity was measured at 3.8 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5m/s (n = 269). These speed values are similar to those previously reported for GFP::IFT52 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buisson et al., 2013</a>). Overall, these results show that IFT27 distribution and movement are similar to the other IFT-B proteins studied to date in <i>T. brucei</i>."

To analyze the impact of IFT27 depletion on flagellar formation, two markers were used: MAb25 (monoclonal, axoneme-specific) and L8C4 (monoclonal, paraflagellar rod-specific).

In a second approach, the IFT-B core protein IFT52 was expressed as a GFP fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Therefore, the modified T19N protein produces a phenotype only when the endogenous IFT27 expression is inhibited, suggesting a recessive effect of the T19N mutation. Immunofluorescence assays using the monoclonal antibodies Mab25 and L8C4 showed that the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>Q67L</i> <b>(GTP-locked)</b> cells were undistinguishable from their non-induced control (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>) whereas <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>T19N</i> <b>(GDP-locked)</b> cells build unusually short flagella after 3 days of induction (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11F</a>, arrows). The flagellar length of the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>Q67L</i> cell line showed no significant differences between non-induced (16.9 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b5m, n = 100) and induced cells (16.6 \u00b1 2.98 \u00b5m, n = 100) whereas flagellar length of <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>T19N</i> cells dropped to 3.7 \u00b1 3.1 \u00b5m (n = 79) after induction compared to 17.6 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b5m (n = 100) for the non-induced controls. However, by carefully analysing both <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>T19N</i> and <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>Q67L</i> cells in non-induced conditions, we noticed that the length of the flagellum was shorter by about 3 \u00b5m compared to cell that are not expressing a mutated form of IFT27 (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). This interesting result indicates that the expression of a GDP or GTP-locked form of IFT27 has a slightly negative dominant impact on the formation of the trypanosome flagellum. Once the endogenous IFT27 is depleted, this effect is exacerbated in the case of the GDP-locked version but not in the case of the GTP-locked version (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). These observations reveal that the sole expression of the GTP-locked version, although able to sustain flagellum formation, is not neutral."

                                "text": "To investigate if the IFT machinery was disrupted in the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>T19N</i> cell line, immunofluorescence assays using Mab25 and the anti-IFT172 were performed (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A</a>). While the IFT172 staining looked normal in the non-induced context (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13Aa\u2013d</a>), the induced <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>T19N</i> cells did not show signs of IFT B complex accumulation but IFT172 was found concentrated at the base of the organelle (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13Ae\u2013h</a>) in a way reminding of the localization of the IFT140 protein in the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> cell line (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This is in stark contrast with the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> cell line where the depletion of IFT27 is accompanied by accumulation of IFT172 inside the flagellum (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>). The phenotype obtained in the induced <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>T19N</i> cells is reminiscent to the ones observed upon disruption of the anterograde IFT machinery (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pazour et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Absalon et al., 2008b</a>) and shows that the expression of IFT27<sup>RNAiRES</sup>T19N in the absence of endogenous IFT27 triggers an anterograde IFT phenotype. To understand this intriguing phenotype, the flagellar structure of the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>T19N</i> cell line was analyzed by TEM and scanning electron microscopy. TEM observations were not conclusive, as no visible defects in the axoneme structure were detected. These results could be explained by the fact that <i>T. brucei</i> assembles the new flagellum while retaining the old one and that only this one, formed prior to the RNAi-mediated silencing of IFT27, could be observed. On the other hand, SEM revealed the presence of abnormally short flagella with no visible dilation (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13Aj</a>, arrow) and the presence of a \u2018flagellar sleeve\u2019, a long and thin extension of the flagellum membrane (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13Aj</a>, arrowheads). This is very different from the induced <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> cells that possess a short, bulky flagellum, in agreement with the presence of an excessive accumulation of material (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12Bj</a>, arrow). Since the IFT dynein is found concentrated at the base of flagellum after IFT27 depletion (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), we wondered what could be the localization of the motor in the presence of the Q67L and T19N versions of IFT27. This was addressed by immunofluorescence assays using an anti-DHC1b antibody in non-induced and induced <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>Q67L</i> <b>(GTP-locked)</b> or <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>T19N</i> <b>(GDP-locked)</b> cells. In <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>Q67L</i> cells, the dynein signal showed no significant difference between the non-induced and induced conditions (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>) suggesting that the motor is functional and participates normally to IFT. In contrast, DHC1b remained at the flagellum base in induced cells solely expressing the T19N mutant protein (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14e\u2013h</a>, arrow). In conclusion, the GDP-locked version does not sustain the entry of the IFT-B complex in the flagellar compartment, leading to an anterograde phenotype. Nevertheless, dynein is still targeted to the base of the flagellum."

By TEM, this accumulated material appeared as electron dense regions spread around short, irregular and often disrupted axonemes whereas the basal body and transition zone appeared normal. All these features are reminiscent of a retrograde phenotype, usually caused by a deficit of either the IFT dynein or the IFT-A complex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pazour et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Absalon et al., 2008a</a>). Interestingly, DHC1b and IFT140, two essential molecules of the dynein and IFT-A complex respectively, are not able to enter the flagellum in the absence of IFT27 (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16B</a>). The IFT dynein is the retrograde motor of IFT that brings back IFT trains from the tip to the base of the flagellum, a process in which IFT-A is also involved although its exact contribution remains to be shown. Being an IFT-B protein, IFT27 could therefore regulate IFT-A and dynein transport at the physical interface between IFT-A, IFT-B and dynein complexes to ensure coordinate import in the flagellar compartment. Supporting that view, some relationships between IFT-B proteins and the IFT dynein motor have been suggested in the literature. First, IFT-B and dynein genes are both controlled at the transcriptional level by the transcription factor RFX whereas IFT-A and kinesin II are regulated differently in metazoans (<a href=\"#bib59\">Thomas et al., 2010</a>). Second, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that DHC1b interacts with the IFT-B protein IFT172 in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pedersen et al., 2006</a>). In <i>T. brucei</i>, we could not detect a direct interaction between IFT27 and DHC1b or IFT27 and IFT140 by co-immunoprecipitation (unpublished data) but the association might be transient, for example taking place only during protein entry in the flagellar compartment."

In addition, the IFT25/27 structure displays a surface patch able to mediate protein\u2013protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhogaraju et al., 2011</a>). This IFT25/27 sub-complex could then act as a scaffold mediating the interaction of the IFT-B complex with dynein and IFT-A complexes. In <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, the RNAi knockdown of IFT27 produced cells with abnormally short flagella but the nature of the IFT defect (effect on anterograde or retrograde IFT) has not been reported (<a href=\"#bib43\">Qin et al., 2007</a>). In this organism, it is the only IFT protein whose inhibition triggers cell cycle defects. However, the specificity of the phenotype has not been proven and an off-target effect cannot be excluded. In trypanosomes, the flagellum is essential for cell morphogenesis and cytokinesis and inhibition of all <i>IFT</i> genes studied so far invariably resulted in growth arrest (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kohl et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Davidge et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Absalon et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Franklin and Ullu, 2010</a>). In the present study, the possibility of this being an off-target effect has been ruled out upon complementation of the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> phenotype by the expression of an RNAi-resistant version of IFT27 that rescued both the observed growth and flagellar phenotype while displaying normal IFT trafficking in non-induced as well as in induced cells. IFT27 has all the necessary features to function as a GTPase, although it displays low intrinsic activity during in vitro assays (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhogaraju et al., 2011</a>). The orthologue of IFT27 in the related protozoan <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> exhibits GTPase activity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ramos et al., 2005</a>). As the <i>T. cruzi</i> protein is 88.5% similar to IFT27 and all the key residues are conserved, it is very likely that the <i>T. brucei</i> protein is also able to hydrolyze GTP. We have shown that the Q67L version apparently behaves like the unmodified protein even in the complete absence of the endogenous protein. Thus, IFT27 likely interacts with other IFT complex B members, controls the entry of the IFT-A complex and DHC1b and enters the flagellum in a GTP-bound state (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16A</a>). These findings could be compared with previous results showing that a constitutively active GTPase activity does not affect the localization of various Rab proteins (<a href=\"#bib49\">Richardson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alvarez et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nachury et al., 2007</a>). Another possible caveat to explain the absence of phenotype in the cells expressing the Q67L version of IFT27 is that the protein is not actually impaired in its GTPase activity so that it undergoes a normal chemical cycle. However, this is not likely the case as we noticed that cells expressing both the endogenous and the GTP-locked protein possessed a slightly shorter flagellum compared to cell that are not expressing a mutated form of IFT27 (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). These observations reveal that the sole expression of the GTP-locked version, although able to sustain flagellum formation, is not neutral."

However, the modified T19N protein was not found inside the flagellar compartment neither in the presence nor in the absence of endogenous IFT27 and was unable to associate with the IFT-B complex. One would then expect that the exclusive expression of IFT27 in its inactive state should phenocopy the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> cell line. Strikingly, this was not the case as only very short flagella that do not exhibit accumulation of IFT proteins were built, typical of anterograde inhibition (<a href=\"#bib2\">Absalon et al., 2008b</a>). Several explanations could be proposed to explain this intriguing result. First, the inactive IFT27 protein could sequester other components of the IFT-B complex in the cytoplasm and inhibit their transfer to the base of the flagellum. However, immunofluorescence assays revealed that IFT172 is still found concentrated at the base of the flagellum but not inside organelle. Second, the inactive protein could interfere with assembly or stability of the IFT-B complex in the cytoplasm, a hypothesis supported by the reported decrease in the amount of several IFT proteins in the <i>Chlamydomonas IFT27</i> RNAi experiments (<a href=\"#bib43\">Qin et al., 2007</a>). However, this seems unlikely here because the total amount of IFT172 and IFT22 did not decrease when the IFT27T19N protein was exclusively expressed in the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAiRES</i></sup><i>T19N</i> cell line (unpublished data). Third, the inactive IFT27 could negatively control the entry of the IFT-B complex hence resulting in an anterograde phenotype while the wild-type protein in non-induced conditions would overhaul this effect."

The \u03b4- and \u03b5-tubulins, involved in basal body maturation, are also absent from the genomes of these two organisms (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dutcher, 2001</a>). Finally, the basal bodies are deeply rooted in the cytoplasm in <i>Giardia</i>, with long cytoplasmic axoneme segments (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dawson and House, 2010</a>). Therefore, the absence of IFT27 and IFT25 could be related to the non-canonical structure of their flagellum base, implying a different process for the entry of the IFT proteins. Alternatively, the requirement for retrograde transport might be different according to the type of cilia, necessitating specific adaptations for IFT-A/IFT dynein trafficking. Inhibition of retrograde IFT moderately affects the length of sensory cilia in <i>Drosophila</i> (reduced by one third in IFT140 or dynein mutants, <a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2008</a>) or <i>C. elegans</i> (reduced by 25% in IFT-A mutants, <a href=\"#bib8\">Blacque et al., 2006</a>) in contrast to the severe reduction observed in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pazour et al., 1999</a>), trypanosomes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kohl et al., 2003</a>) or <i>Leishmania</i> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Satir and Christensen, 2007</a>). In summary, these findings demonstrate that a GTPase-competent IFT27 is required for association to the IFT complex and that IFT27 plays a role in the cargo loading of the retrograde transport machinery."

The 29\u201313 cell line expressing the T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline-repressor (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wirtz et al., 1999</a>) has been described previously, as well as the cell line expressing GFP::IFT52 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Absalon et al., 2008b</a>). For generation of the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> cell line, a 360-nucleotide fragment of <i>IFT27</i> (Tb 927.3.5550) was amplified by PCR and cloned in the pZJM vector (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2000</a>), allowing tetracycline-inducible expression of dsRNA generating RNAi upon transfection in the 29-13 recipient cell line. The dsRNA is expressed from two tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters facing each other in the pZJM vector. Primers were selected using the RNAit algorithm to ensure that the fragment lacked significant identity to other genes to avoid cross-RNAi (<a href=\"#bib47\">Redmond et al., 2003</a>). The fragment was amplified by PCR with the forward primer cgatcg<span class=\"underline\">AAGCTT</span>aaacttgcgtcttcaggtgg and the reverse primer gtcat<span class=\"underline\">CTCGAG</span>atttgcgagatctttcccct, digested with XhoI and HindIII (sites underlined) and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pZJM vector. The plasmid was linearized at the unique NotI site in the rDNA intergenic targeting region before transfection (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2000</a>). GeneCust Europe (Dudelange, Luxembourg) conducted the chemical synthesis of the pPCPFReGFPIFT27 plasmid allowing a GFP tagging at the N-terminal of IFT27. The whole <i>IFT27</i> gene (552 nucleotides) was synthetized, digested with NheI and EcoRV and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pPCPFR vector (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adhiambo et al., 2009</a>). The resulting plasmid was linearized with NsiI, targeting integration in the intergenic region of <i>PFR2</i>. Generation of the p2845TdTomatoIFT140 plasmid enabling the expression of TdTomato::IFT140 was performed by modifying the p2845IFT140 mCherry plasmid. The mCherry gene was removed from p2845IFT140 using XhoI and HindIII while simultaneasouly getting the TdTomato gene from the p2675TdTomatoIFT81 plasmid with the same restriction enzymes. Ligation was performed between the digested p2845IFT140 plasmid and the TdTomato insert overnight at 16\u00b0C, the resulting plasmid was then transfected into XL-10 Gold Ultracomptent Cells (Agilent Technologies, France) to allow amplification. Plasmids from 10 different colonies were double digested with XhoI and HindIII to assess the presence of the TdTomato insert."

Additional point mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) made by GeneCust Europe enabled the creation of the RNAi-resistant versions of IFT27 in a GTP (Q67L) or GDP (T19N) locked state (GeneBank Accession Numbers KF147878 and KF147879). The YFP-tagged version of IFT27RNAires was made by synthetizing and cloning the <i>YFP</i> gene into the pPCPFRIFT27RNAires vector between the NheI and BamHI restriction sites.

At least the most naive expectation would be that if IFT27 affects retrograde but not anterograde transport, then this should be evident as a drop in the retrograde transport frequency without a corresponding drop in the anterograde frequency. We do agree that their end-point phenotypic analysis, showing accumulation of IFTB proteins in short swollen cilia full of electron dense material does strongly support a specific defect in retrograde transport, but wouldn't a live cell analysis make this point much more directly? Perhaps there are tricky timing issues: obviously one would have to do the analysis early enough in the RNAi process that the cilia had not yet become short stumps. The authors do mention that such data exists (for example the authors mention mention having done this analysis for IFT140) but they do not show it. In particular, IFT52 kymographs would strongly support their model of impaired retrograde return being the cause for IFTB accumulation in the RNAi lines. You may have had good reasons why this analysis wasn't possible but I think that you should at least spell those reasons out, since this really seemed like a glaring omission, especially given the incredibly thorough level of treatment that the authors gave to every other aspect of their story."

This is surprising since one normally thinks of G proteins as executing a cyclic reaction so that jamming the reaction at any point in the cycle should impair function. I bring this up because it was a surprising aspect of the story, but to their great credit the authors face this surprise head on and give several possible explanations. These seem reasonable but worth commenting that this was the one point in the paper where the story suddenly deviated from what one might have expected. Perhaps there is an explanation. IFT is a cycle, with anterograde particles switching to retrograde motion and then re-entering the flagella for another anterograde run. Given the cyclic nature of IFT, and the fact that IFT27 is involved in coupling retrograde and anterograde motion, a palausible model could have been that the GTPase cycle of IFT27 was coupled to the directional cycle of IFT. There was never really any reason to think this, but many readers will make a similar assumption and thus be startled by the active site mutant results. We would thus encourage the authors to emphasize a bit more explicitly the idea that the two cycles might have been coupled but apparently are not. That may help readers to avoid confusion."

We indeed considered doing this experiment in an <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> cell line expressing another IFT protein fused to a fluorescent protein, using our well set-up procedure to extract kymographs. However, we did not do these experiments because a similar approach using the <i>IFT140</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> strain, a reference strain for inhibition of retrograde transport, turned out to be inconclusive (Fort &amp; Bastin, unpublished data). In this case, the reporter protein was a fusion between YFP and IFT81, a core protein of the IFT-B complex (Bhogaraju et al, Science 2013). Two obstacles probably explain this. First, when cells were analysed at early time points of RNAi when they still possess a flagellum of reasonable length, no statistically significant differences could be found in the ratio between anterograde and retrograde trains (Slide 1, Films 19h and 25h). This could be due to the fact that in these cells, the unbalance is too discrete to be detected. One has to keep in mind that we can monitor IFT only for a few minutes before fading of the GFP/YFP signal whereas it takes 4-5 hours to assemble a full-length flagellum."

Second, as time progresses, the number of cells with a flagellum that can be analyzed drops due to the rapid emergence of cells with a new tiny flagellum filled with IFT particles. In the few cells that can technically be analyzed, the amount of IFT material is high, turning the flagellum very bright and preventing observation of individual trains (Slide 1, Film 49h). Since we could not reach a clear conclusion on the seminal retrograde transport mutant, we did not try the experiment on the <i>IFT27</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> strain. Nevertheless, as pointed out by the reviewers, we think that the end-stage phenotype of piling-up of IFT proteins in the short flagellum is demonstrating convincingly the involvement of IFT27 in retrograde IFT. This phenotype has been taken as landmark for attributing a retrograde function to multiple genes in for example <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (Pazour et al JCB1999), <i>C. elegans</i> (Blacque et al MBC2006) or humans (Perrault et al AJHG2012)."

However, this was somehow expected since the defect in that case is due to failure of entry of IFT-A and dynein motors. We did not show the film since a video where nothing moves is not very informative. The distribution of these two proteins is shown by immunofluorescence in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7 and 8</a>."

                    "text": "We wish to thank the reviewers for this important question. By carefully analyzing the GDP and the GTP-locked mutants in conditions where the endogenous IFT27 protein is still expressed, we noticed that the length of the flagellum was shorter by about 3\u03bcm. This indicates that the expression of the GDP- or the GTP-locked versions has a slightly dominant negative impact on the formation of the flagellum. Once the endogenous IFT27 is depleted, this effect is exacerbated in the case of the GDP-locked version but not in the case of the GTP-locked version. These results reveal that the sole expression of the GTP-locked version, although able to sustain flagellum formation, is not neutral. A new figure has been introduced to describe this result and a new section has been added to the text."
