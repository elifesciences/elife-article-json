We discovered membrane immersion allows substrates to be identified in a fundamentally-different way, based initially upon exposing \u2018masked\u2019 conformational dynamics of transmembrane segments rather than sequence-specific binding. EPR and CD spectroscopy revealed that the membrane restrains rhomboid gate and substrate conformation to limit proteolysis. True substrates evolved intrinsically-unstable transmembrane helices that both become unstructured when not supported by the membrane, and facilitate partitioning into the hydrophilic, active-site environment. Accordingly, manipulating substrate and gate dynamics in living cells shifted cleavage sites in a manner incompatible with extended sequence binding, but correlated with a membrane-and-helix-exit propensity scale. Moreover, cleavage of diverse non-substrates was provoked by single-residue changes that destabilize transmembrane helices. Membrane immersion thus bestows rhomboid proteases with the ability to identify substrates primarily based on reading their intrinsic transmembrane dynamics."

Through a combination of biochemical and spectroscopic methods, they have discovered that rhomboid proteases identify the proteins they act on mainly by detecting changes in dynamic behavior: only those proteins that lose a stable helical structure when they exit the lipid phase to interact with the rhomboid protease will be cut by the rhomboid protease. Soluble proteases, on the other hand, achieve specificity by looking for proteins with a particular sequence of amino acids. The novel strategy used by rhomboid proteases allows them to patrol the membrane for unstable helices and selectively cut them. This discovery provides the first explanation of why these complicated enzymes evolved to have active sites immersed within the cell membrane."

These enzymes achieve their exquisite specificity by recognizing a short binding motif surrounding the scissile bond to align the substrate along the elongated active site cleft of the protease (<a href=\"#bib32\">Schechter, 2005</a>).

These polytopic membrane proteins assemble a protease active site within the membrane using catalytic residues contributed by different transmembrane (TM) segments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Erez et al., 2009</a>). Even more remarkable is the broad array of cellular networks that intramembrane proteases have come to regulate. Intensively studied is \u03b3-secretase, an aspartyl intramembrane protease that releases signaling domains from the membrane, including the intracellular domains of the Notch receptor and the amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) implicated in Alzheimer's disease (<a href=\"#bib11\">De Strooper et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wolfe et al., 1999</a>).

Since these membrane-immersed proteases evolved within the hydrophobic milieu of the membrane, a fundamentally different environment compared to soluble proteases, could this novel environment confer different enzymatic properties?

Further interrogation of proteolysis directly in living cells suggest that rhomboid proteases expose the propensity of TM helices to exit the membrane and unwind as a substrate-discrimination mechanism, rather than relying on recognition-sequence binding like all other known specific proteases."

The shift was even more dramatic with APP + Spi7, an engineered substrate that harbors seven TM residues of Spitz within the C-terminal 99 residues of human APP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Urban and Wolfe, 2005</a>). In fact, some rhomboid enzymes abandoned the natural AS entirely in favor of cleavage +3 and/or +5 residues deeper (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, also see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

We functionally identified TM5 of GlpG as part of the lateral gate for substrate access to the active site (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Urban and Baker, 2008</a>), although other models have also been proposed (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ha, 2009</a>). Since cleavage sites shifted only deeper into the TM segment, we examined gate dynamics. We introduced a nitroxide spin label onto TM5 at W236, a position we previously identified to be key for gating, and onto the overlying extramembraneous Cap loop at M247 as a control. The particular W236 and M247 sites were also attractive because neither contribute to GlpG's structural stability (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baker and Urban, 2012</a>). We then monitored dynamics directly at these sites using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. As expected, we observed two spectral components: a dynamic form (\u03b1 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and an immobilized form (\u03b2 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These are consistent with the gate-open and gate-closed conformations, respectively, observed by X-ray crystallography (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib37\">Urban, 2010</a>). Interestingly, the relative proportion of these two forms changed when GlpG was in different environments. Both TM5 and Cap sites were readily observed in the highly-dynamic form when GlpG was in the detergent-solubilized state. However, while the Cap site retained a high proportion in the mobile form when GlpG was reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), the TM5 position shifted almost completely to the strongly restrained form (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This is consistent with conversion to a predominantly gate-closed form, indicating that the membrane confers site-specificity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) by restricting gate dynamics (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

These shifts are particularly instructive because the natural sequence containing any possible binding motif is completely unperturbed, yet is abandoned for an \u2018impermissible\u2019 sequence (<a href=\"#bib35\">Strisovsky et al., 2009</a>) with alanine and glycine at P4 and P2\u2032, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Moreover, addition of helix-destabilizing residues at other positions could also induce shifts: mutating the P2\u2032 isoleucine to glycine caused a +1 shift (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

In fact, intramembrane cleavage become so efficient that in all cases it outcompeted the natural juxtamembrane cleavage by metalloproteases, and in the case of Delta, little unprocessed full-length protein could be detected. Cleavage was dependent on rhomboid activity, because it required the catalytic serine of both <i>Drosophila</i> and human rhomboid proteases, and \u03b3-secretase inhibition did not affect cleavage (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Differences between substrate and non-substrate TM helices are minimal while they reside in the membrane. However, a defining property of rhomboid substrates is a meta-stable TM helix that actually relies on the membrane for stability, and unravels without it.

To limit this inherent drawback, we were careful, whenever possible, to make conservative mutations, measure effects on helicity directly by CD, and ultimately base our analysis on &gt;30 mutations. Nevertheless, we further evaluated what underlying physical property drives the cleavage site shifts and ultimately found the strongest correlation with a \u2018turn propensity\u2019 scale. The informative feature of this novel scale is that it integrates both the helical propensity of a residue, as well as its preference to be inside the membrane versus seeking a more hydrophilic environment (<a href=\"#bib26\">Monn\u00e9 et al., 1999a</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">1999b</a>). As such, the intrinsic dynamics in rhomboid substrate TMs thus likely derives from a combination of residues that destabilize the TM helix structure directly, as well as those of limited hydrophobicity that increase the likelihood of this polypeptide region escaping the helix-inducing environment of the membrane (in favor of the hydrophilic active site of rhomboid, see below). This observation independently suggests that the key differences in TM dynamics are evaluated in a different, non-membranous environment. This may explain why alanines are known to be important for rhomboid proteolysis yet themselves are not helix-destabilizing directly, and require mutation to large hydrophobic residues to compromise proteolysis."

If these confounding parameters also apply to rhomboid proteolysis, accurately predicting absolute propensities of natural TM segments from sequence alone may present challenges.

Preference for cleavage to shift to between small residues re-affirmed prior studies (<a href=\"#bib39\">Urban and Freeman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akiyama and Maegawa, 2007</a>). However, little appears to be essential for cleavage beyond small P1/P1\u2032 residues, since we found a great diversity of residues at other positions allowed efficient proteolysis to proceed by multiple rhomboid proteases.

True substrates would nevertheless be expected to have further sequence optimization that would be specific to a particular rhomboid protease, because greater proteolytic efficiency would be favored as substrate and protease co-evolve. One current example might be TatA proteolysis, because TatA cleavage is thought to proceed rapidly and automatically for quorum sensing to operate (<a href=\"#bib34\">Stevenson et al., 2007</a>). However, this is unlikely to be representative of most rhomboid functions.

So why did complicated, membrane-immersed enzymes evolve and become so wide-spread across all forms of life? Our analyses indicate that rhomboid proteases achieve substrate specificity first through reading TM dynamics, which endows them with different properties relative to soluble proteases. Intramembrane proteases might therefore be a distinct group of enzymes in the cell, not because they are proteases that release proteins from the membrane, but because they are membrane-immersed; they live in a world with different rules, giving the cell a set of enzymes with unique properties that it can harness for evolving new functions."

The bottom line is that the membrane provides rhomboid proteases with the ability to identify substrates based primarily on their intrinsic TM dynamics."

This is an exciting topic for further study, and we have been careful to present a balanced description. On the one hand, we describe how we calculated the values (in the Materials &amp; Methods) and point out, as noted by the Reviewers, that with such a high correlation it is likely to have predictive value as a tool for finding new rhomboid protease substrates. On the other hand, we caution that our correlation is based on a difference calculated between two substrates that are identical except at only 1 or 2 positions. As such, the relative <i>changes</i> in \u2018turn propensity\u2019 are highly controlled. A challenge described by the \u2018turn propensity\u2019 authors is that the propensity of the same residue differs when it is placed in transmembrane segments of different length, of differing sequence context, and depending on precisely where the residue is placed. As such, using the \u2018turn propensity\u2019 scale as an <i>absolute</i> value to predict rhomboid substrates from natural transmembrane sequences could prove to be challenging. Nevertheless, experimental refinement of the scale with rhomboid proteases directly is likely to improve its predictive accuracy even further."
