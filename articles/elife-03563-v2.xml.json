                    "text": "Human chromosomes terminate in telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences bound by the shelterin complex. Shelterin protects chromosome ends, prevents recognition by the DNA damage machinery, and recruits telomerase. A patch of amino acids, termed the TEL-patch, on the OB-fold domain of the shelterin component TPP1 is essential to recruit telomerase to telomeres. In contrast, the site on telomerase that interacts with the TPP1 OB-fold is not well defined. In this study, we identify separation-of-function mutations in the TEN-domain of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) that disrupt the interaction of telomerase with TPP1 in vivo and in vitro but have very little effect on the catalytic activity of telomerase. Suppression of a TEN-domain mutation with a compensatory charge-swap mutation in the TEL-patch indicates that their association is direct. Our findings define the interaction interface required for telomerase recruitment to telomeres, an important step towards developing modulators of this interaction as therapeutics for human disease."

Shelterin protects chromosome ends, prevents recognition by the DNA damage machinery, and recruits telomerase. A patch of amino acids, termed the TEL-patch, on the OB-fold domain of the shelterin component TPP1 is essential to recruit telomerase to telomeres. In contrast, the site on telomerase that interacts with the TPP1 OB-fold is not well defined. In this study, we identify separation-of-function mutations in the TEN-domain of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) that disrupt the interaction of telomerase with TPP1 in vivo and in vitro but have very little effect on the catalytic activity of telomerase. Suppression of a TEN-domain mutation with a compensatory charge-swap mutation in the TEL-patch indicates that their association is direct. Our findings define the interaction interface required for telomerase recruitment to telomeres, an important step towards developing modulators of this interaction as therapeutics for human disease."

Every time a cell divides, its chromosomes are duplicated. However, the proteins that are responsible for copying the DNA cannot reach the very end of the DNA strand, causing the chromosomes to progressively shorten. To ensure that this does not cause genetic information to be lost, each chromosome ends in a repetitive stretch of DNA called a telomere. Though the end of the telomere is lost whenever the DNA is copied, an enzyme called telomerase replaces the sequence that has been lost and counteracts the shortening of the telomeres."

Shelterin contains a specific site that attaches to telomerase, but exactly how the human versions of these two molecules bind to each other is unknown. A possible interaction site had been identified on the telomerase, which, when mutated, stops the telomerase working properly. However, as this region is also involved in lengthening the telomeres after the chromosomes have duplicated, it is not certain that these problems result from the telomerase failing to bind to shelterin."

Schmidt et al. discovered that replacing two specific amino acids in human telomerase prevents its binding to shelterin. Cells that produced the modified form of the telomerase had chromosomes with shortened telomeres. However, if the cells also produced modified versions of the shelterin complex that were designed to bind to the modified telomerase, telomere length was normal. This indicates that the telomerase interacts directly with shelterin, rather than through a \u2018bridging\u2019 molecule."

Chromosome ends pose two challenges to cells: they resemble DNA damage sites, and they shorten progressively each cell cycle due to the end-replication problem (<a href=\"#bib25\">Levy et al., 1992</a>). The six-protein shelterin complex specifically binds telomeric DNA and prevents the DNA damage machinery from recognizing telomeres (<a href=\"#bib32\">Palm &amp; de Lange, 2008</a>). Additionally, shelterin recruits telomerase, an RNA-containing reverse transcriptase that adds telomeric repeats to the 3\u02b9-end of the single-stranded overhang to maintain telomere length (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nandakumar and Cech, 2013</a>). Loss-of-function mutations in telomerase and shelterin components cause human diseases like dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</a>). In addition, like stem cells and germ cells, 90% of cancers depend on telomerase activity to maintain the potential to proliferate indefinitely (<a href=\"#bib40\">Stewart and Weinberg, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shay and Wright, 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Its catalytic core is comprised of hTERT and the telomerase RNA component (hTR), which contains the template used for telomeric DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cech, 2004</a>). In the holoenzyme, hTR also associates with dyskerin for stability and with TCAB1 for telomerase maturation and trafficking to Cajal bodies (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mitchell et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Venteicher et al., 2009</a>). The hTERT protein contains four domains, the telomerase N-terminal domain (TEN-domain), the telomerase RNA-binding domain (TRBD), the reverse transcriptase domain (RT-domain), and the C-terminal extension (CTE) or putative thumb domain of the reverse transcriptase. The TRBD- and RT-domains of hTERT bind hTR and position the template of hTR in the RT-domain active site to synthesize telomeric repeats (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cech, 2004</a>). The TEN-domain participates in the catalysis of telomeric repeat addition (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jacobs et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jurczyluk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Robart and Collins, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wu and Collins, 2014</a>). Additionally, both the TEN-domain and CTE contain DAT (dissociates activities of telomerase) regions, N-DAT and C-DAT, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Armbruster et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Banik et al., 2002</a>). Mutations in either DAT-region disrupt the ability of telomerase to immortalize cells, but they retain catalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Armbruster et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Banik et al., 2002</a>). Based on experiments with N-DAT mutants, the TEN-domain has been proposed to mediate telomerase recruitment to telomeres (<a href=\"#bib5\">Armbruster et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2004</a>)."

Telomerase localization to Cajal bodies requires the interaction of hTR with TCAB1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Venteicher et al., 2009</a>). TCAB1 is not required for enzymatic activity but for function in vivo (<a href=\"#bib45\">Venteicher et al., 2009</a>), indicating that recruitment to Cajal bodies is a key step in telomerase trafficking or maturation. Recruitment of telomerase to the telomere requires the shelterin component TPP1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Xin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abreu et al., 2010</a>). TPP1 is recruited to the shelterin complex via an interaction with TIN2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abreu et al., 2010</a>). TPP1 also tightly binds to POT1 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2007</a>), which specifically binds the telomeric single-stranded DNA overhang (<a href=\"#bib8\">Baumann and Cech, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lei et al., 2004</a>). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the interaction between the POT1-TPP1 complex and telomerase stimulates its repeat addition processivity (RAP), that is, increases the number of consecutive repeats that telomerase synthesizes in a single round of telomeric DNA addition (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2007</a>). Recently, the TEL-patch, a group of mostly acidic amino acids on the oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold domain of TPP1 was shown to be necessary for telomerase recruitment in vivo and RAP stimulation in vitro (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nandakumar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sexton et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, cell biological assays demonstrated that the OB-fold domain of TPP1 is sufficient to recruit telomerase to a non-telomeric chromosomal locus (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>). Although TPP1 is critical for recruitment of telomerase to the telomere, it has been unclear whether TPP1 makes a direct interaction with telomerase or if their interaction is bridged by another component."

The TEN-domain of hTERT is a potential candidate to contain key residues necessary for the interaction with TPP1. A mutation in the TEN-domain of hTERT, G100V, is defective in stimulation of telomerase processivity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zaug et al., 2010</a>) and fails to localize to telomeres in vivo (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>). However, G100V telomerase has substantially reduced enzymatic activity (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zaug et al., 2010</a>); thus, it is difficult to assess whether its failure to function in vivo is due to an activity or recruitment defect. Furthermore, the interaction between TPP1 and telomerase may require a bridging factor. In <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, Ccq1 bridges the interaction between Tpz1, the TPP1 homologue, and telomerase (<a href=\"#bib27\">Miyoshi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Moser et al., 2011</a>). A human homologue of Ccq1 has not been identified (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nandakumar and Cech, 2013</a>). Thus, it is unclear if telomerase directly interacts with TPP1 in human cells."

The mutants retain high catalytic activity, but their interaction with POT1-TPP1 is compromised in vitro. Furthermore, the TEN-domain mutants fail to localize to telomeres and cannot maintain telomere length in vivo. Importantly, a compensatory mutation in the TEL-patch of TPP1 rescues a mutation in the TEN-domain of hTERT both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the interaction between telomerase and the OB-fold domain of TPP1 is direct. These observations open the door to more directed approaches for targeting the TPP1-telomerase interface as a therapeutic strategy for human diseases."

To test whether the mutant telomerases are recruited to telomeres<i>,</i> we transiently over-expressed mCherry-tagged hTERT variants and hTR in HeLa cells and determined the subcellular localization of telomerase by immuno-fluorescence (IF). Under all conditions hTERT and hTR were expressed at similar levels, indicating that mutations in the TEN-domain did not affect hTERT or hTR stability (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). As previously described (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>), wild-type telomerase localized to telomeres and promoted the formation of neo-Cajal bodies at most telomeres, as shown by the co-localization of TRF2, hTERT, and coilin foci (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In contrast, all three hTERT mutants tested (K78E, R132E, K78E;R132E) localized to bona fide Cajal bodies, forming \u223c1\u20133 large foci per cell that co-localized with coilin but did not localize to telomeres marked by TRF2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results demonstrate that TEN-domain mutants that do not interact with POT1-TPP1 in vitro also fail to localize to telomeres in vivo. Furthermore, because Cajal body localization of hTERT requires its association with hTR, our observations indicate that telomerase assembly is unaffected by mutations in the TEN-domain."

Thus, while the absolute expression level of mCherry-hTERT varied between the stable cell lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), telomerase immuno-purified from the cell lines had comparable activities per cell, and these activity levels were threefold to fourfold higher than levels in untransfected control cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

Expression of wild-type hTERT caused a progressive increase in telomere length to \u223c14.8 kb (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, TEN domain mutants K78E and R132E failed to elongate telomeres, despite the fact that telomerase enzymatic activity per cell was higher than in the parental HeLa cell line (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). In addition the TEN domain mutant K78E;R132E also failed to elongate telomeres, but due to its reduced activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), we cannot conclude that this is exclusively due to a localization defect. These observations reinforce the conclusion that telomerase with K78E or R132E mutations in the TEN-domain fails to elongate telomeres due to an inability to localize to telomeres, not an activity defect."

In contrast, introduction of the E215K mutation significantly increased the co-localization of K78E telomerase with the TPP1-OB-fold domain (p &lt; 0.05). Thus the E215K mutation in the TPP1-OB-fold compensates for the presence of the K78E mutation in hTERT in vivo. Importantly, E215K TPP1 had no effect on the localization of R132E and K78E;R132E telomerases, demonstrating that E215K specifically compensates for the presence of the K78E mutation in hTERT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). If another protein were bridging telomerase and TPP1, any combination of two defective mutations should be even more defective. Thus, finding a compensatory double mutant demonstrates that telomerase is recruited to telomeres by a direct interaction between the TEN-domain of telomerase and the TPP1-OB-fold domain in part by a contact formed between K78 in the TEN-domain and E215 in the TPP1-OB-fold domain."

R132 in the TEN-domain also participates in the interaction, but the corresponding residue on the TEL-patch and the nature of the interaction remains unknown (?). TPP1 is recruited to telomeres through interaction with TIN2 and further stabilized by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein POT1.

Several lines of evidence, including naturally occurring disease-associated alleles of hTERT (V144M) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tsakiri et al., 2007</a>) and synthetic mutations (G100V, R132D, N-DAT), have implicated the TEN-domain of hTERT in telomerase recruitment to telomeres (<a href=\"#bib4\">Armbruster et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zaug et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Stern et al., 2012</a>). Unfortunately, due to the involvement of the TEN-domain in catalysis and RAP, many of these mutations also alter the enzymatic activity of telomerase. Thus, TEN-domain mutants can have pleotropic effects and may not specifically disrupt the telomere\u2013telomerase interface (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zaug et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">2013</a>). Our results demonstrate that a region in the TEN-domain including K78, R132, and V144 is required for telomerase recruitment in vivo and POT1-TPP1-mediated RAP stimulation in vitro, albeit to varying degrees. The differences in RAP stimulation may reflect the importance of the respective residue in an interaction with TPP1. The recruitment defects and failure to maintain telomeres in vivo occur in the context of wild-type levels of activity, suggesting that the mutants described in this study are separation-of-function alleles that dissociate enzymatic activity from recruitment. Importantly, the recruitment defects of K78E and R132E telomerases recapitulate those of TEL-patch mutant TPP1 proteins (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Nandakumar et al., 2012</a>).

However, Est3 appears to stimulate telomerase activity rather than act as a recruitment factor (<a href=\"#bib41\">Talley et al., 2011</a>). Recruitment is instead mediated by the interaction of the Est1 subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme and Cdc13 at the telomere (<a href=\"#bib14\">Evans and Lundblad, 1999</a>), and charge-swap mutations indicate that this interaction is direct (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pennock et al., 2001</a>). Thus, in budding yeast the interaction between a TPP1-like OB-domain protein (Est3) and the TEN-domain of TERT (Est2) is conserved, but the recruitment mechanism differs significantly from that in humans."

Depletion of TIN2 from shelterin (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abreu et al., 2010</a>) and perturbation of the TCAB1-hTR interaction (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stern et al., 2012</a>) both result in a reduction of telomerase association with the telomere.

However, synthetic C-DAT mutants have severe activity defects (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huard et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jurczyluk et al., 2011</a>). In addition, disease-associated mutations in and near C-DAT have varying effects on activity and cellular localization of telomerase. E1117X has \u223c10% of wild-type activity and appears to be sequestered to Cajal bodies in vivo (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tsakiri et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>); in contrast, F1127L has reasonable activity (\u223c70%) and localizes to telomeres, and it is stimulated by POT1-TPP1 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zaug et al., 2013</a>). Thus, CTE mutants do not have clear recruitment defects dissociated from activity loss, despite their importance based on disease association. In contrast, the observation that a mutant TPP1-OB-domain increases the localization of a mutant hTERT to a non-telomeric locus in vivo, while it strongly decreases the association with wild-type hTERT, demonstrates that a direct TEN-domain-TEL-patch interaction is necessary and may be sufficient for telomerase recruitment to telomeres in humans."

Multiple disease mutations associated with IPF\u2014P33S, L55Q, Pro112ProfsX16, and V144M\u2014cluster in TEN-domain of hTERT. Mutation carriers have significantly shorter telomeres than non-carrier relatives (<a href=\"#bib3\">Armanios et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tsakiri et al., 2007</a>).

Importantly, V144M is defective in TPP1-mediated RAP stimulation in vitro (this study) and fails to localize to telomeres in vivo (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>). Given the propensity of both synthetic and IPF-associated mutations in the TEN-domain of hTERT to disrupt telomere localization, it is likely that some cases of IPF are directly caused by a decrease in telomerase recruitment to telomeres. Agonists of the TEL-patch-TEN-domain interaction that compensated for these mutations and attenuated telomere shortening associated with the disease might be pharmaceutically important."

Inhibitors that disrupt telomerase recruitment to telomeres would provide an additional approach to target telomerase activity in cancer cells.

Our finding that the TEN-domain of hTERT interacts directly with the TEL-patch of TPP1 to bring telomerase to the telomere defines a key interface and provides a direct target for the design of novel therapeutic inhibitors of telomerase action."

Direct telomerase assays were quantified as previously described (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zaug et al., 2013</a>), except the summed counts incorporated into extension products were normalized to both the hTERT levels (determined by western blot) and the loading control and then normalized to WT telomerase.

Briefly, counts for repeats 1\u201320 were corrected for the number of dGTP nucleotides incorporated. The natural log of the counts left behind in each repeat was graphed vs repeat number and fit by linear regression. The slopes of the linear regressions were compared and normalized to WT telomerase. RAP stimulation by PT, for direct extension assays with POT-TPP1, was measured in the same manner as processivity except values were normalized to WT telomerase with WT POT1-TPP1 (i.e., RAP stimulation by PT = processivity of mutant telomerase with TPP1/processivity of WT telomerase with WT POT1-TPP1). The processivity in the absence of POT1-TPP1 was not included the calculation, because (1) it did not vary greatly among the mutants (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and (2) it was so small relative to the processivity in the presence of POT1-TTP1 that dividing by this distorted the calculations and led to irreproducibility. An alternative fraction method of quantitation was also used to determine RAP stimulation by PT, calculated as the fraction of counts in bands 9 and above divided by the total sum of counts incorporated, normalized as described for the decay method. Telomerase from stable cell lines was immuno-purified from identical number of cells and was subjected to direct telomerase assays as previously described (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen and Reddel, 2008</a>).

Briefly, 1.5 \u00b5g of genomic DNA extracted from human cell lines was digested with RsaI/HinfI and separated by gel electrophoresis using a 0.8% 1xTBE agarose gel for a total of 1100 V-hours. DNA was transferred onto a Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare) and telomeric restriction fragments were detected using a radiolabeled (TTAGGG)<sub>4</sub> probe. To determine mean telomere length, lane intensity profiles were extracted using ImageQuant TL and fit to a Gaussian using Kaleidagraph. The mean of the Gaussian distribution was used as telomere length of the respective sample."

They present in vivo experiments to document the interaction and specificity. They identify two residues in the TEN domain, K78 and R132 that affect telomerase RAP processivity as well as some effects on catalytic activity and telomere length. They then go on to identify one mutation in TPP1, E215 that compensates for the K78 mutant in the TERT TEN domain. The authors conclude that unlike in S. pombe, where TERT and the TPP1 homologue are bridged by a protein, CCQ, in human cells, these two proteins interact directly. Unfortunately all of the evidence presented here is in vivo and thus no clear conclusion about any possible bridging protein can be made. Rather than directly addressing the potential interaction of the TEN domain and TPP1 by using biochemical assays, the authors used a series of in vivo surrogates that suffer from a number of caveats. For example, high-level protein overexpression is used to examine cellular localization, when over expression is well known to distort protein localization. Without any direct demonstration of an interaction of TPP1 and the TEN domain that is mediated by the charge swap mutants that are described, the conclusions here are not supported by the data."

The hypothesis they are trying to test is whether these two proteins interact and if that interaction is mediated by the charged residues on the TEL patch of TPP1 and the opposite charges on the TERT- TEN domain. There are a number of biochemical assays that they could use. They could purify the specific proteins or the domains and test interaction and affinities on Biacore chips. They could use GST pull down experiments, affinity columns or similar techniques. This assays presented here including the Cajal body localization and LacO array recruitment are very indirect and are in vivo. Thus they do not exclude a bridging protein, as the authors try to conclude. For the authors to conclude that the interaction of TERT and TPP1 is a direct interaction, and mediated by the charged residues they identify, evidence of direct protein interaction in vitro needs to be presented."

To determine if the TERT TEN domain mutants localize to telomeres, the authors overexpress the mutants and examined localization to telomeres or Cajal bodies. This experiment is not sufficient to conclude the proteins fail to localize to telomeres. Overexpression of proteins is known to cause spurious cellular localization. The fact that overexpression of the wt gives different pattern than overexpression of the mutant only indicates that the mutants may aggregate differently in the cell. If they want do make conclusion about protein localization, a second method without overexpression is needed. The authors state they have an antibody to TERT, so ChIP and Co-IP might be an alternative. Finally the authors do not show the level of over expression or look at the stoichiometry of the various holoenzyme components. The authors conclusion from this experiment that TEN domain and and TPP interact is not supported by these experiments.

They should use a cell line that does not express hTR such as VA13 and show there is no signal with this technique, or use mouse cell lines that are deleted for the endogenous mTR and show there is no signal. Unless a control for specificity is shown this experiment should be omitted. The authors conclude from this experiment that mutant hTERT exerts a dominant effect on endogenous hTR localization.

Over expression of these mutant enzymes that have decreased activity will sequester all of the hTR and result in overall reduced telomerase activity and thus explain reduced telomere elongation.

The telomere length of untransfected HeLa cells over the 8-week period shown in lanes 1 and 2 are not changed, as expected. When Wt hTERT is overexpressed telomeres clearly lengthen. When the mutants are expressed telomeres fail to lengthen. Given the intrinsic heterogeneity of the telomeres, and following just one clone, is not possible to make accurate comparisons of the various lengths in cell lines where there is a failure to elongate. But it is clear that each of the three mutant analyzed fail to elongate the telomeres while overexpression of wt hTERT does show elongation.

The heterogeneity in the telomere lengths is just too variable. It is clear that telomere do not elongate as they do when the Wt TERT is overexpressed. To convince the readers that there is actually significant shortening of telomeres, with these heterogeneous lengths, it would be necessary to show several independent clones and show a decrease occurs reproducibly in several independent clones. It is well established that there is significant telomere heterogeneity in culture, so one sample that appears marginally shorter in one lane, without repetition is not convincing. I understand redoing this experiment is a lot of work. For that reason it would be best to simply narrow the conclusion to what can clearly be established from this data: that the TEN domain mutants fail to elongate telomeres like the Wt TERT does. My earlier comment that the double mutant has less activity than the WT TERT is still a concern. This decreased activity is not shown in this figure but is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> where more quantitative activity assays are done."

The data presented in this study include biochemical assays testing the interaction between TPP1 and telomerase <i>in vitro</i>. It is well established in the literature that the stimulation of telomerase processivity <i>in vitro</i> by POT1-TPP1 is due to an interaction between the TEL-patch of TPP1 and telomerase (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nandakumar et al, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sexton et al, 2012</a>; Zaug et al, 2010). We carry out these assays with recombinant POT1-TPP1 complex, purified from insect cells and bacteria respectively, and telomerase immuno-purified from HEK293T using an affinity tag and protease mediated elution after stringent washing steps. Therefore, the only way a potential bridging factor could still be present is if it were to be tightly associated with telomerase. To address the reviewer\u2019s concerns about a co-purifying bridging factor, we have repeated the <i>in vitro</i> charge swap experiments with telomerase produced and purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL). The results with obtained using RRL telomerase are consistent with those observed with immuno-purified super-telomerase, with statistically significant differences. In addition we have also included new data, demonstrating that E215K TPP1 restores telomeric localization and telomere maintenance in cells. In total we now demonstrate the charge rescue using multiple independent experiments <i>in vivo</i> and telomerase from two sources <i>in vitro</i>. In addition we would like to point out that a compensatory effect of combining two individually deleterious mutations is inconsistent with the presence of a bridging factor. We have now illustrated this concept in more detail in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and provided several additional examples from the literature in the Discussion, which use charge-swap experiments to assess direct protein-protein interactions."

In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> we analyse the activity of telomerase over-expressed in HEK293T cells followed by immuno-purification using the ProA-tag on the N-terminus of hTERT. The activity levels in the experiments in <a href=\"#fig1\">figure 1</a> are normalized to both the loading control and the intensity of the western blot band shown. The activity shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> is a measure of telomerase activity per cell and is normalized to both loading control and the number of cells used to purify telomerase. Since endogenous telomerase lacks an affinity tag we had to use an alternative approach to purify telomerase from the cell lines stably expressing the different hTERT alleles and the parental HeLa cell line. We chose to use a well-established method using a polyclonal antibody against hTERT to immuno-purify telomerase from these cell lines (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen &amp; Reddel, 2008</a>). The results in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> demonstrate that all cell lines over-expressing the hTERT alleles have a 3-4-fold higher telomerase activity than the parental HeLa cell line. This observation is crucial since it rules out lower telomerase activity as a possible explanation for the reduced telomere length in the cell lines expressing hTERT with mutations in the TEN-domain. To the contrary, telomeres shrink in cell-lines expressing TEN-domain mutant alleles despite 3-4-fold higher telomerase activity per cell. This observation in combination with the lack of telomerase present at telomeres in these cells, lead us to the conclusion that telomeres shrink due to the failure of telomerase association with telomeres. The differences in activity observed could be due to the experimental set up or purification procedure, but they don\u2019t compromise the main conclusions of either figure: K78 and R132 are involved in the interaction between telomerase and TPP1 (and to a lesser degree impact catalytic activity) and thus fail to maintain telomere length due to the failure to localize to telomeres."

Therefore, the vast majority of hTR, which is the limiting component for telomerase assembly under these conditions, should be assembled with exogenous hTERT molecules. Additionally, overexpression of only hTERT leads to a 3-4-fold increase in telomerase activity since endogenous hTR is not limiting the level of telomerase, while overexpression of both components leads to a 200-fold increase (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cristofari et al, 2007</a>).

Mutation of the TEN-domain or the TEL-patch independently reduces the association between telomerase and the OB-fold domain of TPP1, which is manifested in a reduced fraction of nuclei in which telomerase and the GFP-TPP1 OB-LacO foci co-localize. If each independent mutation reduces the affinity for one or more potential bridging factors, simultaneous mutation of the TEN-domain and the TEL-patch should lead to an additive reduction of the fraction of nuclei that show co-localization of telomerase and OB-fold foci. We observe the opposite result: mutation of the TEL-patch rescues the presence of a mutation in the TEN-domain. While WT-telomerase co-localizes with E215K OB-fold in only 20% of the nuclei, K78E-telomerase co-localizes with E215K OB-fold in over 75% of the nuclei. The only plausible explanation is that mutation of the TEN-domain or TEL-patch independently eliminates a direct interaction between these charged residues, which is re-established by swapping the charged residues on both surfaces. We have now added an illustration to <a href=\"#fig5\">figure 5A</a> outlining not only how a charge swap can support a direct interaction between the TEN-domain and the TEL-patch, but also how it can rule out the presence of a bridging factor.

There is a higher degree of variability in the data shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, as is reflected in the error bars. The conclusion we are trying to draw from these experiments is that telomeres shrink due to a defect in telomere recruitment of telomerase, not an activity defect. The untransfected control maintains the same telomere length, while overexpression of WT hTERT leads to a significant growth in telomere length, due to a 4-fold increase in telomerase activity per cell compared to the untransfected control. In contrast, overexpression of TEN-domain mutants leads to telomere shortening, even though the telomerase activity per cell is increased to a similar degree as with WT hTERT. Thus, cells expressing TEN-domain mutants have much higher telomerase activity than untransfected cells, yet their telomeres are not maintained at the same level as untransfected cells, therefore an activity defect cannot be the cause of telomere erosion. If the telomere shortening of R132E and K78E;R132E were merely due to an activity defect, overexpression of hTERT and thereby raising the activity level 3-4 fold should compensate for the activity defect, which it does not."

When it is expressed alongside WT TPP1 it localizes to the LacI focus since the amount of TPP1 present at this site is far greater than any individual telomere. When telomerase can interact with neither the telomere nor the TPP1-OB fusion, as is the case with R132 and R132/K78E mCh-hTERT, it is diffusely localized in the nucleoplasm.
