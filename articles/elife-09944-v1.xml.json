These events offer early career researchers the opportunity to be exposed to new scientific research questions, to explore how their own ideas might fit into the larger research landscape, and to develop their own research agenda. We discuss the merits and challenges, based on our own experiences of organizing a series of science hackathons. Following on from the success of the first event in September 2014 (which we summarize in <a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a>), we are currently organizing two additional science hackathons, which will take place in the second half of 2015."

We ran five projects with 22 participants in total, which led to six paper drafts and two software packages. For example, we ran a protocol paper project on Bayesian inference of animal receptor models and another project on a comparison of code development approaches and techniques in academia. Overall, the event was a great success with highly positive feedback from the participants. Both funding sources were keen to support similar events in the future. At this time, we have funding for two more science hackathons, and are planning to organize these in the fall of 2015.

The aim of a hackathon is to bring together researchers with complementary skills and knowledge; they then work together to create an initial scientific write-up and research plan, which can provide the momentum needed to get a new collaboration off the ground. The write-up can subsequently form the basis for a collaborative funding proposal and, eventually, a research paper. This offers the researchers the opportunity to establish new and completely independent collaborations with minimal intrusion into their normal duties, and in the process create a basis for long-lasting interdisciplinary research projects."

The science hackathon is different in a number of important ways. Primarily, science hackathons do not feature the competitive element commonly found in programming hackathons, as we believe a non-competitive atmosphere between projects helps stimulate creativity and allows for more open discussions between groups. In addition, the incentives for a science hackathon are arguably more long-term than those for a programming hackathon and include, for example, preparing a paper, writing a proposal for funding, and/or making steps towards becoming a more independent researcher. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, we provide an overview of the steps needed to create, run, manage and consolidate science hackathon projects."

Before the event, participants have the opportunity to propose suitable projects. A scientific organizing committee must then try to select a number of these and match all other participants and their skills with suitable project partners. The early career researcher proposing the project will usually take the overall lead on their idea. However, this does not preclude other team members taking the lead on individual aspects of the project. This is especially feasible with interdisciplinary work, whereby one person may lead on the statistical methodology, another may lead on the computational aspects, while another still may assume ownership of the experimental research. This mix of complementary scientific perspectives allows for more individuals to develop their own leadership skills and take ownership of different ideas within a single research project."

Research is by its nature a risky endeavour; we often don't know in advance what is possible until we try it, and research directions will often change as a project develops. By focusing on a small task, however, we may often gain insight into the bigger challenges that arise in the overall research. Depending on the field of research, suitable short-term aims could include: the exploratory analysis of an existing dataset; writing proof-of-concept computer code that applies existing methodology to a new problem; developing a plausible mathematical model for describing a biological system or natural phenomenon of interest; creating a skeleton draft of a paper; or writing an initial draft of a funding proposal."

This also provides a strong incentive for early career researchers to contribute and invest time into the collaboration long after the event. We suspect that making a project plan alone is unlikely to provide sufficient momentum; it is easier for early career researchers to justify working on projects that are already well underway, with existing computer code to build on, a basic mathematical model to extend, or a research grant outline to be developed."

For example, a couple of participants could develop a mathematical model, while other participants work on developing computer code or draft an introductory section for the write-up, outlining the possible directions for the research. The key is that each member is able to contribute their unique expertise to this interdisciplinary hackathon project."

In our case, we opted for a self-contained conference venue with a garden and usable outdoor space in a tiny town in Northamptonshire for two and a half days (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> for several impressions of the first event and the venue), although in retrospect we feel that a slightly longer duration would have been beneficial."

The simplest way to do this is by engaging with the team leaders on a monthly basis about the progress of their projects, and offering further assistance in developing their collaboration. In our case, we arranged funding for follow-up meetings, where various groups can come together and strengthen their new research agendas. As the established collaborations mature, we expect them to become more self-driven and self-funded."

Finally, another one of the teams is nearing completion on a paper draft investigating a Bayesian analysis of photoreceptor models. The first science hackathon event has therefore resulted in many collaborations and interdisciplinary pieces of work between participants who would not otherwise have engaged with one another, and we look forward to discovering the new collaborations that will arise from our planned science hackathon events in the near future."
