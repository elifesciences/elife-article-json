Our understanding of this process, especially how the cytoskeleton influences it, remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that mice lacking the \u03b1-tubulin acetyltransferase Atat1 in sensory neurons display profound deficits in their ability to detect mechanical stimuli. We show that all cutaneous afferent subtypes, including nociceptors have strongly reduced mechanosensitivity upon Atat1 deletion, and that consequently, mice are largely insensitive to mechanical touch and pain. We establish that this broad loss of mechanosensitivity is dependent upon the acetyltransferase activity of Atat1, which when absent leads to a decrease in cellular elasticity. By mimicking \u03b1-tubulin acetylation genetically, we show both cellular rigidity and mechanosensitivity can be restored in Atat1 deficient sensory neurons. Hence, our results indicate that by influencing cellular stiffness, \u03b1-tubulin acetylation sets the force required for touch."

Our understanding of this process, especially how the cytoskeleton influences it, remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that mice lacking the \u03b1-tubulin acetyltransferase Atat1 in sensory neurons display profound deficits in their ability to detect mechanical stimuli. We show that all cutaneous afferent subtypes, including nociceptors have strongly reduced mechanosensitivity upon Atat1 deletion, and that consequently, mice are largely insensitive to mechanical touch and pain. We establish that this broad loss of mechanosensitivity is dependent upon the acetyltransferase activity of Atat1, which when absent leads to a decrease in cellular elasticity. By mimicking \u03b1-tubulin acetylation genetically, we show both cellular rigidity and mechanosensitivity can be restored in Atat1 deficient sensory neurons. Hence, our results indicate that by influencing cellular stiffness, \u03b1-tubulin acetylation sets the force required for touch."

In many cases this process occurs through direct interplay of ion channels with the lipid bilayer. For example, the bacterial mechanotransduction channel MscS (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sukharev, 2002</a>) and eukaryotic two-pore-domain potassium channels TRAAK and TREK1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brohawn et al., 2014a</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib5\">2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lolicato et al., 2014</a>) are fully activated by mechanical stimuli when reconstituted in reduced membrane systems, and the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is also likely to be gated by force exerted via lipids due to its exceptional sensitivity to membrane tension (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cox et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</a>). However, in-vivo, membrane ion channels are not isolated from the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, and mechanical sensitivity may depend on further interaction with other cellular components such as the underlying cytoskeleton to modify and redistribute membrane tension (<a href=\"#bib17\">Delmas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krieg et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Qi et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, in <i>Drosophila</i>, NompC ion channels were shown to be linked between the plasma membrane and microtubules by a tether protein domain in the N-terminus of the channel, and this linkage is essential for mechanosensitivity of the channel (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, in <i>C. elegans</i> touch sensitivity of specialized touch receptor neurons is dependent on both the actin binding protein \u03b2 spectrin (<a href=\"#bib25\">Krieg et al., 2014</a>) and the microtubule cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bounoutas et al., 2009</a>)."

Moreover, mutation of MEC17, the major tubulin acetyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akella et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Shida et al., 2010</a>) also reduces touch sensitivity in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cueva et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Topalidou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>). Of note, it is not clear whether this loss of touch sensitivity stems from the absence of tubulin acetylation in MEC17 mutants (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shida et al., 2010</a>) or from other unknown actions of MEC17 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akella et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Davenport et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fukushige et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Topalidou et al., 2012</a>)."

Intriguingly, Atat1, the mammalian orthologue of MEC17, is expressed ubiquitously in all mouse peripheral sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kalebic et al., 2013a</a>), and these neurons have amongst the highest level of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation in the mouse (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kalebic et al., 2013b</a>).

We found that Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice display a profound loss of mechanical sensitivity to both light touch and painful stimuli with no impact on other sensory modalities. We demonstrate that this arises from a reduction in mechanosensitivity of all cutaneous afferent subtypes, including nociceptors, and adecreased mechanically activated currents in sensory neurons upon Atat1 deletion. We further establish that this broad loss of mechanosensitivity is dependent upon the acetyltransferase activity of Atat1, and that by mimicking \u03b1-tubulin acetylation genetically, mechanosensitivity can be restored in Atat1 deficient sensory neurons. Finally we show that acetylated microtubules localize to a prominent band under the membrane of sensory neuron cell bodies and axons, and in the absence of Atat1 and acetylated \u03b1-tubulin, cultured sensory neurons display significant reductions in their cell elasticity. Our results indicate that the microtubule cytoskeleton is an essential component of the mammalian mechanotransduction complex and that by influencing cellular stiffness, \u03b1-tubulin acetylation can tune mechanical sensitivity across the full range of mechanoreceptor subtypes."

                                "text": "To investigate cell autonomous effects of Atat1 disruption in sensory neurons we took a conditional gene deletion strategy. <i>Atat1</i><sup>fl/+</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kalebic et al., 2013b</a>) were crossed with a sensory neuron specific Cre driver line <i>Avil</i>-Cre (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zurborg et al., 2011</a>) to generate <i>Avil</i>-Cre::<i>Atat1</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> (referred to as Atat1<sup>cKO</sup>) and control <i>Avil</i>-Cre::<i>Atat1</i><sup>fl/+</sup> mice (referred to as Atat1<sup>Control</sup>). Mice were then subjected to a series of behavioural assays. We first tested their ability to detect an innocuous mechanical stimulus applied to the hairy skin. Adhesive tape was fixed gently to the backs of animals and the number of responses counted over a 5 min observation period. While control mice made regular attempts to remove the tape, Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice effectively ignored the tape for much of the time, and the total number of responses was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We next investigated the sensitivity of mice to innocuous mechanical stimuli applied to the glabrous skin by lightly stroking the underside of the paw with a diffuse cotton swab. Again, Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice responded significantly less (p&lt;0.01) to this stimulus than Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). We also examined whether mechanical sensitivity to punctate stimuli was altered in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice by applying von Frey filaments of calibrated forces to the hindpaw of mice. Control animals responded to forces as low as 0.07g with an increase in detection into the noxious range. However, Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice required significantly higher forces to evoke a response throughout the range of von-Frey filaments (median threshold 0.4g for Atat1<sup>Control</sup> and 1g for Atat1<sup>cKO\u00a0</sup>p=0.003, Mann-Whitney test) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). To investigate noxious mechanical sensitivity in more detail, we analysed responses to a clip applied to the base of the tail. Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice displayed substantially longer response latencies to the clip compared to Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice and again, essentially ignored this noxious stimulus (p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). We further tested whether thermal detection was effected by Atat1 deletion by measuring responses to noxious heat or to evaporative cooling. We observed no difference in withdrawal latencies to a range of temperatures in the hotplate test between Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> and Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>) or to tail immersion in a hot water bath (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, sensitivity to cooling of the paw with acetone was comparable in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> and Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). Finally we assessed the motor coordination and of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice by evaluating their performance on a rotarod device or on a raised metal grid. Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> and Atat1<sup>Control</sup> mice displayed similar latencies to fall from the rotating drum across all speeds tested (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a>) and a similar number of slips from the grid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h</a>). Thus, Atat1 is required for the detection of innocuous and noxious mechanical touch but not for noxious heat or proprioceptive coordination."

Reductions in firing frequencies were evident during both the ramp phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) of the mechanical stimulus and during the static phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). RAM fibres displayed a similar reduction in their stimulus response function (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and an increased latency to the highest displacement stimulus (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A characteristic of these fibres is that they display higher firing frequencies with increasing stimulus speed (<a href=\"#bib33\">Milenkovic et al., 2008</a>), a feature which was also reduced in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Similar to low threshold fibres, both populations of nociceptor exhibited a reduced number of action potentials evoked by indentation (AM units: <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a and b</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>), longer latencies for mechanical activation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>) and no change in electrical thresholds and conduction velocities in the absence of Atat1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). Mechanical thresholds to von Frey stimuli were also elevated in C-fibre nociceptors (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) highlighting the strength of the phenotype in this population. Finally, we analysed heat responsiveness of C-fibre nociceptors in Atat1<sup>Control</sup> and Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice. We observed no difference between genotypes in the proportion of C-fibres responding to heat, or in their activation thresholds and firing rate in response to a heat stimulus (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus collectively, these data indicate that Atat1 is specifically required for mechanical sensitivity across all major fibre types innervating the skin."

We thus performed a systematic analysis of the organization of the peripheral nervous system upon deletion of Atat1. We first tested whether the number of sensory neurons and their innervation of the skin and spinal cord were affected by deletion of Atat1. We observed no change in the number of myelinated and unmyelinated fibres in the saphenous nerve (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013d</a>), in the number, density, or organization of terminal endings in the skin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e\u2013h</a>), or in the innervation of the spinal cord by CGRP, IB4 and NF200 positive sensory neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4m\u2013p</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next examined axonal outgrowth and neurotrophin/receptor transport in sensory neurons. In whole mount DRG explants supported in the presence of NGF we detected no difference in the growth rate or length of axons in DRG from Atat1<sup>Control</sup> and Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4i\u2013k</a>). Moreover, single molecule imaging of NGF/receptor transport in a microfluidic device revealed that the displacement and velocity of quantum dot labelled NGF molecules (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sung et al., 2011</a>), was not altered in the absence of Atat1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4l</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Taken together with electrophysiological analysis, these data indicate that the loss of mechanosensitivity is not due to generalized effects on neuronal function but rather arises from defects in the ability of sensory neurons to transduce mechanical forces into electrical signals."

Such a stimulus can evoke mechanically gated currents in\u00a0~90% of DRG neurons that are further classified as rapidly adapting (RA), intermediate-adapting (IA) and slowly adapting (SA) responses (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu and Lewin, 2006</a>). In the absence of Atat1, we observed a marked loss in the number of mechanically sensitive neurons evoked by cell prodding that was evident across each subtype of current (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Furthermore, the small proportion of neurons which still displayed mechanosensitive currents in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice exhibited significantly reduced current amplitudes and higher thresholds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b\u2013d</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but no difference in their activation kinetics (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Other functional parameters such as voltage gated channel activity, resting membrane potential, action potential threshold, and sensitivity to capsaicin or pH were indistinguishable between Atat1<sup>Control</sup> and Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">3</a>). We also examined perimembrane dynamics of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo2 in the absence of Atat1, and observed no difference in Fluorescence Recovery After Bleaching (FRAP) of a Piezo2-GFP fusion construct transfected into dissociated neurons (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Thus the reduced mechanical sensitivity of DRG neurons in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice does not arise from compromised membrane properties in these cells or defects in mechanosensitive ion channel trafficking."

As a positive control we determined that transfection of an Atat1-YFP construct rescued mechanosensitivity in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> cultures and that the proportion of RA, IA and SA responses across the DRG returned to control levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>). We subsequently transfected a catalytically inactive form of Atat1 (termed Atat1-GGL) that has no acetyltransferase activity but remains functional (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kalebic et al., 2013a</a>). Expression of Atat1-GGL did not restore mechanosensitivity in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> neurons, and we observed no difference in the proportion of different types of mechanically activated current compared to mock EGFP transfection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>).

We therefore asked whether a similar structure is also evident in peripheral sensory neurons and whether it is dependent upon the presence of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin. We performed superresolution dSTORM (direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy)(microscopy on DRG neurons stained with \u03b1-tubulin antibodies, and indeed observed that microtubules form an interweaved network in all neurons examined, especially towards the centre of the cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a and b</a>). However, we were unable to detect clearly visible differences in organization between Atat1<sup>Control</sup> and Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> sensory neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a and b</a>). To assay this more quantitatively we subjected superresolution images to an unbiased automated analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c\u2013f</a>). We observed no difference in microtubule density (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6g</a>), the number of microtubule crossing points (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6h</a>), or the angular variance of the microtubule cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6i</a>) in any neuron between Atat1<sup>Control</sup> and Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice indicating that acetylation does not influence the gross organization of the microtubule network. To investigate whether the absence of microtubule acetylation could indirectly impact upon the actin cytoskeleton, we also performed phalloidin staining on DRG neurons. Again we did not detect any difference in the organization of the actin network upon deletion of Atat1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

One possibility is that it sets the rigidity of cells thereby influencing the amount of force required to displace the plasma membrane and activate mechanosensitive channels. We explored this by directly measuring cell elasticity using atomic force microscopy. In DRG neurons from Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice we observed that cellular stiffness was significantly higher across a range of indentations extending from displacements of 200 nm to 600 nm (p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7e</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

We demonstrate that this impacts strongly upon both light touch and pain, and that all mechanoreceptor subtypes which innervate the skin are less responsive in the absence of Atat1. This phenotype arises from reduction of the amplitude of mechanically activated currents in sensory neurons, and we propose that it is mediated by the loss of a sub-membrane band of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice that sets mechanical rigidity of these cells. Our data thus describe a model whereby cellular stiffness regulates mechanical sensitivity by setting the force required to indent the plasma membrane and activate mechanosensitive ion channels."

Indeed in C. elegans, several reports indicate that acetylated tubulin is not required for touch sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akella et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Davenport et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fukushige et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Topalidou et al., 2012</a>) and as such it is unknown as to how MEC17 (the C. elegans orthologue of Atat1) regulates mechanosensation in nematodes. It was therefore important to determine whether \u03b1-tubulin acetylation does indeed underlie the loss of mechanosensation in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice. We addressed this through genetic rescue experiments where we attempted to restore mechanosensitivity of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> sensory neurons by exogenous expression of Atat1 and \u03b1-tubulin point mutants. Importantly, we found that an acetyltransferase deficient form of Atat1 had no effect on mechanically activated current amplitude, while genetically mimicking tubulin acetylation with an \u03b1-tubulin K40Q mutation did restore mechanosensitivity. Thus acetylated microtubules are likely the effector for the loss of mechanosensation in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice, suggesting that mammals and nematodes may utilize Atat1 differentially in controlling touch sensation."

We performed a thorough analysis of the organization of the peripheral sensory system and observed no differences in rates of neurotrophin/receptor transport and axon outgrowth in vitro, or in the ultrastructure of peripheral nerves and their innervation of the skin and spinal cord in vivo. Moreover, deletion of Atat1 was remarkably selective in that it impacted only on cutaneous mechanosensation and had no effect on thermal responses, or on electrical or other functional properties of sensory neurons such as their sensitivity to capsaicin and pH. We have previously reported that STOML3, another critical mediator of mechanotransduction, associates with microtubules in a specialized vesicle where it interacts with acid-sensing (proton-gated) ion channel (ASIC) subunits (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lapatsina et al., 2012</a>). Uncoupling of vesicles from microtubules leads to incorporation of STOML3 into the plasma membrane and increased acid-gated currents. Acetylation status of microtubules could conceivably influence the transport of these vesicles and contribute to the phenotype in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice. However, since we observed no alteration in proton gated currents, it is unlikely that the reduction of mechanosensitivity is due to the altered transport of STOML3 in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice."

This is in contrast to Piezo2 knockout mice which display severe proprioceptive defects (<a href=\"#bib47\">Woo et al., 2015</a>). The lack of proprioceptive phenotype in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice does not stem from incomplete recombination by the Avil-Cre driver in proprioceptive neurons because we previously observed that full Atat1 knockout mice also display no alterations in proprioception (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kalebic et al., 2013b</a>). Rather it may arise either from developmental compensation of a partial reduction in mechanosensitivity in these neurons, or from mechanistic differences in mechanotransduction in proprioceptors and cutaneous afferents. Similarly, we did not observe here, or in ubiquitous knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kalebic et al., 2013b</a>), any apparent change in other aspects of mechanosensation, such as whisker function and exploration, or in developmental consequences of reduced touch sensitivity such as nursing or growth. This may reflect a lack of sensitivity of the tests we performed, or again, developmental compensation arising from residual responsiveness. The use of more selective conditional Cre lines would circumvent this problem and also allow for further studies on the role of Atat1 in specific touch sensations such as those arising from C-low threshold mechanoreceptors or from visceral mechanical nociceptors, which were not considered here."

Furthermore our AFM measurements showed that in the absence of Atat1 and acetylated \u03b1-tubulin, the stiffness of sensory neurons was significantly elevated across a range of indentation stimuli in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice, and cells were more resistant to osmotically induced shrinkage. We also monitored the movement of microtubules during shrinking using live imaging, and again observed reduced compression of the microtubule network upon Atat1 deletion. Importantly this defect could be rescued by introduction of the \u03b1-tubulin acetylation mimic into neurons. Thus our data point towards a role for acetylated tubulin in setting neuronal elasticity, and imply that in its absence, cells are stiffer which ultimately changes the force distribution to the neuronal membrane, requiring more force to indent the membrane and activate mechanosensitive channels. This is consistent with the phenotype in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice in that all mechanoreceptor subtypes, regardless of the type of mechanosensitive currents/channels, are less responsive in the absence of Atat1. It also suggests that a residual response may be evident across patch clamping, skin-nerve electrophysiology and behavioural experiments, in that at higher forces, neuronal membranes in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice would eventually be displaced, leading to mechanosensitive ion channel activation. Whether this is the case could be directly addressed using new technology based upon pillar arrays that displace neurons in the nanometer range allowing for quantitative analysis of mechanoelectrical transduction (<a href=\"#bib34\">Poole et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, another approach which has been used previously (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ranade et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wetzel et al., 2007</a>), would be to determine whether any afferents lose their mechanosensitivity completely in the ex vivo skin nerve preparation, which we did not investigate here."

                        "text": "While our data shows that there is a correlation between reduced mechanical sensitivity and neuronal elasticity in the absence of Atat1, there are some caveats to this interpretation. For example, we performed AFM measurements at the neuronal soma whereas in vivo, mechanotransduction occurs at sensory neuron endings. In future work it would therefore be informative to assess cell stiffness along neurites which are much more sensitive to mechanical displacement than the cell body (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu and Lewin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Poole et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, we detected acetylated tubulin enriched under the membrane of axons which are not in themselves mechanosensitive, and while we show that acetylated tubulin is expressed at neuronal endings in the cornea, superresolution microscopy would be required to demonstrate conclusively that it is indeed submembrane localized. In this light there are also other models of mechanosensation that would accord with our data. For example, microtubules have been implicated in sensory mechanotransduction in <i>Drosophila</i> larval dendritic arborisation neurons (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>), <i>C. elegans</i> touch receptor neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bounoutas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fukushige et al., 1999</a>) and mammalian osmosensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2014</a>). Their role has mainly been explored from the perspective of an anchoring function that serves to tether mechanosensitive ion channels in the membrane. Further support for a tethered mechanotransduction complex comes from observations in sensory neurons where a physical tether has been described that may link mechanosensitive ion channels to the extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al., 2010</a>). It is possible that acetylated tubulin serves as a coordination point for these tethers in the mechanotransduction complex, and that in its absence misorganization of the microtubule network leads to reduced force transfer from the extracellular matrix to ion channels. Finally, another critical component of the complex, STOML3 has been demonstrated to change the force distribution in neuronal membrane via binding cholesterol. However, while a specific reduction of stiffness in sensory neuron membranes is observed in STOML3 knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib36\">Qi et al., 2015</a>), cellular stiffness is increased upon deletion of Atat1, yet both STOML3 knockout mice and Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice exhibit deficits in mechanosensation. One explanation for this difference is that disruption of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation increases the overall neuronal stiffness, rendering sensory neurons more resistant to mechanical deformation, and thereby impeding the transmission of force to other mechanical transducing elements, including STOML3, the cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix and plasma membrane. In contrast, STOML3 distributes the force directly within the membrane to ion channels, and a stiffened membrane facilitates this process. It is also possible that membrane stiffness is set at an optimal range to distribute force among the membrane, cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix and thus tune the sensitivity of mechanosensitive ion channels."

                        "text": "In light of the increased stiffness of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> sensory neurons we also examined the gross organization of the cytoskeleton in these cells. Similar to osmosensory neurons in the hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib35\">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2014</a>) we observed that microtubules formed a lattice like structure in DRG neurons; however this was not altered in the absence of Atat1. Similarly, we detected no difference in phalloidin staining in Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice suggesting that mechanosensory defects do not arise from interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. How \u03b1-tubulin acetylation sets cellular stiffness is therefore not immediately apparent, and a key question will be to investigate whether this occurs by directly altering the rigidity of individual microtubules or through interaction with other membrane and cytoskeletal elements. Intriguingly, it has recently been shown that another tubulin posttranslation modification, detyrosination, stiffens cardiomyocytes and promotes microtubule buckling in these cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Robison et al., 2016</a>). Desmin intermediate filaments were identified as a physical link between detyrosinated microtubules and the sarcomere, opening up the possibility that analogous mechanisms may function in sensory neurons, and that other microtubule posttranslational modifications may also influence sensory mechanotransduction. Further work using electron microscopy for example to examine the structure of microtubules and their modifications at the ultrastructural level, particularly under the membrane, may give insight into this process. What is clear however is that the mechanism appears to be broadly applicable since the lack of mechanosensitivity of Atat1<sup>cKO</sup> mice extends beyond phenotypes observed when other mechanotransduction complex proteins such as Piezo2 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ranade et al., 2014</a>) and STOML3 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wetzel et al., 2007</a>) are deleted. The convergence of multiple mechanisms onto a single posttranslational modification of \u03b1-tubulin, and its remarkable selectivity, indicates that microtubule acetylation represents a fundamental component of the mechanosensory apparatus, as well as an attractive target for novel therapeutic strategies to treat mechanical pain."

Extracellular solution contained (mM): NaCl 140, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2, KCl 4, glucose four and HEPES 10 (pH 7.4), and electrodes were filled with a solution containing (mM): KCl 130, NaCl 10, MgCl2 1, EGTA one and HEPES 10 (pH 7.3). Cells were perfused with drug-containing solutions by moving an array of outlets in front of the patched cells (WAS02; Ditel, Prague). Observations were made with an Observer A1 inverted microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera and the imaging software AxioVision. Membrane current and voltage were amplified and acquired using EPC-10 amplifier sampled at 40 kHz; acquired traces were analyzed using Patchmaster and Fitmaster software (HEKA). Pipette and membrane capacitance were compensated using the auto function of Pulse. For most of the experiments, to minimize the voltage error, 70% of the series resistance was compensated and the membrane voltage was held at \u221260 mV with the voltage-clamp circuit. After establishing whole-cell configuration, voltage-gated currents were measured using a standard series of voltage commands. Briefly, the neurons were pre-pulsed to \u2212120 mV for 150 ms and depolarized from \u221265 to\u00a0+55 mV in increments of 5 mV (40 ms test pulse duration). Next the amplifier was switched to current-clamp mode and current injection was used to evoke action potentials. If the membrane capacitance and resistance changed more than 20% after the mechanical stimulus, the cell was regarded as membrane damaged and the data discarded. Mechanical stimuli were applied using a heat-polished glass pipette (tip diameter 3\u20135 \u00b5m), driven by a MM3A Micromanipulator system (Kleindiek), and positioned at an angle of 45 degrees to the surface of the dish. For soma indentation, the probe was typically positioned so that a 1.4 \u00b5m movement did not visibly contact the cell but that a 2.8 \u00b5m stimulus produced an observable membrane deflection under the microscope. So a 2.8 \u00b5m probe movement was defined as a 1.4 \u00b5m mechanical stimulation, and a series of mechanical steps in 0.7 \u00b5m increment were applied at 5 s intervals. The displacement threshold was determined as mechanical stimulus that elicited a current\u00a0\u226520 pA. For analysis of the kinetic properties of mechanically activated current, traces were fit with single exponential functions using the Fitmaster software (HEKA)."

The MT signal was enhanced by a top-hat filter and then binarised with the same manual threshold for all images. Binary images were skeletonized using CellProfiler's 'skelPE' algorithm and the resulting skeleton was subjected to branchpoint detection. We measured MT density by dividing the skeleton length with imaged cell area and we measured MT crossing density by dividing the number of branchpoints with skeleton length. Moreover, we measured the local angular distribution of the MTs in order to assess whether they run in parallel, or in a crossing manner (angular variance). To this end, we subjected each pixel to a rotating morphological filter using a linear structural element with a length of 11 pixels, and recorded at which angle we obtained a maximum response. We computed the response for angles from 0 to 170 degrees at steps of 10 degrees since there is no information on MT polarity. Next we measured the local circular variance of the MT orientations in a sliding window with a diameter of 51 pixels, using angle doubling as it is commonly done for axial data. The circular variance has a value one if the MTs in a given region are completely parallel and has smaller values (down to 0) if the MTs are oriented in various directions. Finally, we computed the average circular variance of all MT pixels in a given cell. If this value were close to one it would mean that locally, on a length scale of 51 pixels, the MTs are parallel in most of the cell."

The authors report profound deficits in the behavior of the animals when confronted with a variety of mechanical stimuli but no impairments in their responses to thermal stimuli. Analysis of the physiological responses of identified primary afferents innervating the hairy skin indicate that loss of Atat1 leads to profound loss of mechanosensitivity amongst both mechanoreceptors and nociceptors. The authors report that loss of mechanosensitivity is associated with loss of mechanosensitive currents evoked by poking isolated sensory neurons. Importantly, the authors show that the loss of mechanosensitive current can be rescued by reintroducing Atat1 into the neurons or by a mutation in \u03b1-tubilin that mimics the effects of the acetylation. The authors have carried out an extensive series of control experiments in an attempt to rule out indirect effects of Atat1 deletion during development that might impact on the phenotype. Finally, the authors conclude that acetylation of \u03b1-tubilin may be necessary to stiffen the membrane which enhances the ability of force to activate mechanosensitive channels. The paper contains novel and interesting data that will have a significant impact on the field and will be of broad interest to many neuroscientists working on sensory mechanisms. The key conclusion that the authors make that it is membrane stiffness that \"explains\" the effect of the Atat1 gene deletion is however overstated and based on a selective review of the literature. The authors should consider alternative explanations and discuss more critically the interpretation of their experiments."

This is not the place where transduction happens in vivo and more importantly is completely different in morphology to the sensory endings of any sensory fiber type in the skin (tiny elongated tubes compared to a huge compressible balloon). This is fine when measuring the activation of mechanosensitive currents at the cell soma but there are several papers showing that displacement thresholds are much smaller to activate such currents in sensory neurites which are much more similar to sensory ending in vivo (e.g. PMID: 21725315 and Hu and Lewin 2006 quoted, but not in this context)."

However, in a recent study Poole and colleagues showed that membrane displacements of much less than 50 nm are capable of maximally activating mechanosensitive currents in mechanoreceptors (PMID:24662763, not quoted). Indeed, their finding that membrane stiffness increases after deletion of Atat1 is to this reviewer counterintuitive as increased stiffness of the membrane would be expected to decrease the activation threshold for mechanosensitive channels to force. However, this expectation is highly dependent on where channels are in relation to other mechanical elements in the system. Indeed, the authors totally ignore models, which are also based on good experimental evidence in sensory neurons (see PMID: 20075867; 21725315) that physical tethers that link directly or indirectly channels to the matrix are critical for the sensitivity of mechanosensitive channels to force. It appears to me more likely that the organization or mis-organization of the microtubule network in the vicinity of such complexes that include matrix interaction may better explain the loss of mechanoreceptor sensitivity in their mutant mice. In any case ignoring the literature that such interactions are critically important oversimplifies and may mislead the reader. Again, the change in stiffness of the membrane correlates with the effects on mechanosensitivity but does not necessarily explain them."

This is not so easily reconciled with the authors favoured interpretation and should be explicitly addressed in the Discussion. (Posted 27th Sep 2016)"

It is odd here that the authors fail to mention their own work indicating that STOML3 another critical mediator of mechanotransduction is transported in vesicles associated with microtubules (PMID 22773952). Indeed, this paper shows that then molecular characteristics of such vesicles are distinct from classical signaling endosomes so a change in STOML3 transport could conceivably contribute to the phenotype they see. This is worth mentioning and emphasizes that the interpretation that membrane stiffness is everything is being over sold at the expense of other possibilities."

This is fine when measuring the activation of mechanosensitive currents at the cell soma but there are several papers showing that displacement thresholds are much smaller to activate such currents in sensory neurites which are much more similar to sensory ending in vivo (e.g. PMID: 21725315 and Hu and Lewin 2006 quoted, but not in this context).</i>"

However, in a recent study Poole and colleagues showed that membrane displacements of much less than 50 nm are capable of maximally activating mechanosensitive currents in mechanoreceptors (PMID:24662763, not quoted). Indeed, their finding that membrane stiffness increases after deletion of Atat1 is to this reviewer counterintuitive as increased stiffness of the membrane would be expected to decrease the activation threshold for mechanosensitive channels to force. However, this expectation is highly dependent on where channels are in relation to other mechanical elements in the system. Indeed, the authors totally ignore models, which are also based on good experimental evidence in sensory neurons (see PMID: 20075867; 21725315) that physical tethers that link directly or indirectly channels to the matrix are critical for the sensitivity of mechanosensitive channels to force. It appears to me more likely that the organization or mis-organization of the microtubule network in the vicinity of such complexes that include matrix interaction may better explain the loss of mechanoreceptor sensitivity in their mutant mice. In any case ignoring the literature that such interactions are critically important oversimplifies and may mislead the reader. Again, the change in stiffness of the membrane correlates with the effects on mechanosensitivity but does not necessarily explain them.</i>"
