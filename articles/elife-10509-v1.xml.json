We have made patch clamp recordings from Purkinje cells in vivo to identify whether cerebellar output encodes kinematic features of whisking including the phase and set point. We show that Purkinje cell spiking activity changes strongly during whisking bouts. On average, the changes in simple spike rate coincide with or slightly precede movement, indicating that the synaptic drive responsible for these changes is predominantly of efferent (motor) rather than re-afferent (sensory) origin. Remarkably, on-going changes in simple spike rate provide an accurate linear read-out of whisker set point. Thus, despite receiving several hundred thousand discrete synaptic inputs across a non-linear dendritic tree, Purkinje cells integrate parallel fiber input to generate precise information about whisking kinematics through linear changes in firing rate."

We have made patch clamp recordings from Purkinje cells in vivo to identify whether cerebellar output encodes kinematic features of whisking including the phase and set point. We show that Purkinje cell spiking activity changes strongly during whisking bouts. On average, the changes in simple spike rate coincide with or slightly precede movement, indicating that the synaptic drive responsible for these changes is predominantly of efferent (motor) rather than re-afferent (sensory) origin. Remarkably, on-going changes in simple spike rate provide an accurate linear read-out of whisker set point. Thus, despite receiving several hundred thousand discrete synaptic inputs across a non-linear dendritic tree, Purkinje cells integrate parallel fiber input to generate precise information about whisking kinematics through linear changes in firing rate."

This behavior is important for navigation and the animals\u2019 sense of touch. It relies on specialized circuits of cells in the brain to carry information about whisker movement patterns and process the touch signals. A region of the brain called the cerebellum is highly connected to these circuits, but its role in the voluntary movement of whiskers is not clear."

The experiments revealed that individual cells in the cerebellum called Purkinje cells track whisker movements in real time, and with virtually no delay, through both increases and decreases in their activity. Also, Chen et al. found that the patterns of electrical activity in these cells closely mimicked the positions of the whiskers as they moved. These results tell us that cells in the cerebellum use a simple code to represent whisker position during voluntary movement."

Recently, physiological and anatomical studies have unveiled a whisking central pattern generator located in the reticular formation of the ventral medulla that produces rhythmic signals to muscles that generate whisking (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moore et al., 2013</a>). The lateral hemispheres of the cerebellum, in particular lobule Crus I, are strongly implicated in these vibrissae sensorimotor loops (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shambes et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bosman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Proville et al., 2014</a>). Growing evidence suggests synchronization of activity between the cerebellum and other whisker-related brain regions both under anesthesia and during active whisking in the awake state (<a href=\"#bib41\">O\u2019Connor et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ros et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Popa et al., 2013</a>).

Firstly, which kinematic features are represented by PCs? Whisking is a rhythmic process characterized\u00a0both by fast oscillatory forward and backward movements, as well as slower positional changes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hill et al., 2011</a>). Distinct brain regions make different functional contributions to the encoding of this behavior (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kleinfeld et al., 2006</a>). For example, within the neocortex, the phase of whisking is strongly represented in primary somatosensory cortex (vS1, <a href=\"#bib15\">Curtis et al., 2009</a>), whereas slower changes (e.g. the set point and amplitude of whisker movement) are more closely correlated with activity in primary motor cortex (vM1, <a href=\"#bib10\">Carvell et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hill et al., 2011</a>). To understand how the cerebellum fits within the various nested loops of the rodent whisker system, it is necessary to establish the kinematic parameters that are most relevant in the modulation of cerebellar activity. Further, it is important to establish how salient features of whisking are encoded in the activity of single neurons. This information is essential if we are to understand the underlying computational principles of the cerebellar circuit. Changes in both the rate and timing of action potential firing may play a role in sensorimotor encoding (<a href=\"#bib17\">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</a>), and it has been proposed that the cerebellum may serve a general function as a linear coding device (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fujita, 1982</a>). However, these concepts have not been directly confirmed in the intact brain, and thus the cerebellar coding scheme(s) employed in the representation of whisker movement is unknown."

PCs integrate hundreds of thousands of discrete\u00a0synaptic inputs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Palkovits et al., 1977</a>) across a complex non-linear dendritic tree (<a href=\"#bib35\">Llin\u00e1s and Sugimori, 1980a</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">1980b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Finch and Augustine, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Roth and H\u00e4usser, 2001</a>). Despite this complexity, our experiments demonstrate that single PCs accurately encode ongoing whisker movements\u00a0via bidirectional modulation of simple spike firing rate in a linear manner. Our results establish the presence of a whisking coordinate system in the cerebellum and reveal the computational algorithm employed during sensorimotor processing."

We therefore compared PC firing rates during epochs of whisking and non-whisking behavior. In the absence of movement, PCs fired SSs at high frequencies (61.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7 Hz,\u00a0range: 20.1 \u2013 187.9\u2009Hz, n = 70), while the basal rate of CSs was low (1.6 \u00b1 0.1\u2009Hz, range: 0.5 \u2013\u00a03.3\u00a0Hz,\u00a0n = 70). These values are consistent with other recordings made from lateral cerebellar PCs in awake animals (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fu et al., 1997a</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bosman et al., 2010</a>). During bouts of free whisking, a large proportion of PCs (47 out of 70 cells, ~67%) exhibited significant changes in SS rate (p&lt;0.05, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test). While the majority of PCs (40/47) increased their firing rates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), in some PCs (7/47) SS rates decreased during whisking (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Whisker movement was associated with an overall enhancement of the activity of PCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F, G</a>), although the direction and amplitude of SS rate change during whisking was not related to baseline SS firing rates (r = 0.06, p=0.69, n = 47). SS rate changes were therefore non-uniform in both magnitude and sign across the population, with individual PCs exhibiting changes ranging from +128% to -34% during whisking periods (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). We also compared variability in the timing of simple spiking during periods of whisking and non-whisking behavior by measuring the coefficient of variation (CV) of SS firing. Overall, the CV was close to 1 both when mice were at rest (0.9 \u00b1 0.1, range: 0.3 \u2013 6.2, n = 70), and when they actively moved their whiskers (0.8 \u00b1 0.1, range: 0.3 \u2013 2.5, n = 70). Significant changes in SS variability occurred during free whisking in the majority of PCs that displayed\u00a0rate modulation (44/47 PCs; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Moreover, nearly one third (n = 20/70) of PCs demonstrated changes in SS firing regularity alone, suggesting that the temporal patterning of SS might independently encode whisker-related signals.\u00a0In summary,\u00a0SS activity \u2013 either rate, CV, or both - was altered in nearly all PCs (67/70)."

During the course of our PC recordings, mice rarely ran on the treadmill (fraction of all whisking bouts spent running was 3.5%; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, in recordings that included periods of locomotion (n = 10), whisker movements were more protracted (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B, C</a>) and SS firing rates were elevated, independent of the sign of whisking-related modulation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>; p=0.03, paired t test).

A common phenomenon in many regions of the cerebellar cortex is an inverse relationship between SS and CS rate changes during behavior (<a href=\"#bib25\">Graf et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">De Zeeuw et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Badura et al., 2013</a>).

Remarkably, the changes in PC SS firing rate during whisking bouts closely mimicked whisker movement (compare upper and lower panels in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), irrespective of the direction of the rate change (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B, C</a>).

To establish whether changes in PC activity reflect transitions to free whisking in a feed-forward (efferent) or feedback (re-afferent) manner, we determined the temporal relationship between neural activity and behavior. For this purpose, we calculated the cross-correlation between SS firing rate and whisker position, with the analysis centered on the time of whisking onset (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Robust correlations between whisker movement and SS discharge were observed with both large and small whisking-related changes in firing rate (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), and in a manner that was largely independent of the latency between movement and change in firing rate (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Two-thirds of PCs (31/47) exhibited SS firing rate changes that preceded whisking onset by a mean of -34.6 \u00b1 7.9 ms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), and no clear relationship was observed between the latency and magnitude of whisking related alterations in SS rate (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Temporal relationships were preserved when the cross-correlation was calculated based on whisking offset (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). On average, PC SS discharge led whisker movement by ~18 ms (n = 47) at the population level, implying that SS alterations in Crus I predominantly reflect efferent rather than re-afferent signals. However, the distribution of temporal correlations was broad (range: -178 ms to 324 ms), and non-unimodal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>,\u00a0Hartigan's\u00a0dip test; p&lt;0.001, n = 38), indicating that whisking behavior is represented on multiple timescales amongst neighboring PCs within Crus I. Delayed PC responses relative to whisking may result from additional processing of sensory-driven information and/or recurrent motor-related signals during free whisking. In addition, the transmission of whisker signals via parallel fibers (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wilms and H\u00e4usser, 2015</a>) of distant granule cells may account for long latency PC responses within the cerebellar cortex."

Plotting whisker position as a function of SS frequency revealed strong linear correlations: linear regression analysis indicated significant correlations in over 60% of the PCs (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.958 \u00b1 0.005, p&lt;0.05, ANOVA, n = 44 ). Two classes of encoding schemes were observed. Unidirectional PCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) displayed linear changes in SS frequency within a range of positions corresponding to only forward or backward movements relative to the whisker resting point (defined as whisker angle during non-movement; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). These were the most common type of response (37/44) and were associated with either increases or decreases in SS rate. In bidirectional PCs, SS frequency both increased and decreased across the full range of movement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), with SS frequency encoding both protracted and retracted whisker positions (7/44 PCs). Across the PC population, we observed uni- and bidirectional PCs that encoded whisker position with both positive slopes (corresponding to increased SS rate during forward movements) and negative slopes (decreased SS rate during forward movements). To compare representation of whisker position across the population of PCs, SS firing rate was normalized with respect to the spontaneous firing rate and whisker position was normalized with respect to the whisker resting point. Notably, both classes of PC displayed almost perfect linear relationships (unidirectional: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.950 \u00b1 0.004; bidirectional: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.959 \u00b1 0.005) between relative SS firing rate change and whisker position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In unidirectional cells, SS frequency at resting point often differed between bouts of movement and non-movement. Bidirectional PCs never exhibited such large baseline shifts in firing frequency and were capable of continuously representing whisker position through bouts of whisking and non-whisking via alteration of SS frequency."

A transfer function between SS activity and whisker position was computed from a portion of each recording to capture the underlying linear characteristics of the system (n = 18 PC recordings longer than 300 s, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Calculated transfer functions were applied to trains of SS activity from the remainder of the recording to test whether the transfer functions could predict the dynamics of whisker movement.\u00a0Using spike train information from single PCs, it was possible to accurately recover the dynamics of whisker movements over many seconds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In most PCs, the movement reconstruction derived from the transfer function was highly reminiscent of another kinematic parameter \u2013 the set point, which denotes the slowly varying midpoint between the protracted and retracted angles of a single whisking cycle. We therefore measured the correlation coefficient between reconstructed whisker position and set point derived from measurements of actual behavior to evaluate the quality of our decoding. Reconstructions based on PC SS activity were excellent predictors of actual whisker set points (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; range of correlation coefficient: 0.23 \u2013 0.89, mean = 0.57 \u00b1 0.05, p&lt;0.001, n = 18).

While indirect evidence has been found for both schemes, our recordings in behaving animals provide direct support for the proposal that the cerebellar cortex is optimized to perform as a linear coding device (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fujita, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Walter and Khodakhah, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2009</a>).

Both increases and decreases in firing rate are linear with respect to whisker position, suggesting that molecular layer inhibition plays a crucial role in maximizing the range of cerebellar operation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Park et al., 2012</a>)."

Necessarily, sensory re-afferent signals are delayed with respect to movement (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bower et al., 1981</a>) as they are required to propagate from the periphery, and whisker movements are themselves delayed with respect to muscle activity (by a few tens of milliseconds) owing to inertia (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg and Kleinfeld, 2003</a>). In our recordings, the majority of PCs exhibited changes in SS activity that preceded or were coincident with movement, consistent with a feed-forward as opposed to feedback representation of whisking in the cerebellum. The primary motor cortex does not provide the source of this efferent drive, as the cerebellar representation remains intact during transient vM1 inactivation. Processing stations in the midbrain and the brainstem are therefore likely candidates to provide information to the cerebellum about whisker position during voluntary movement."

By providing rapid information about current or future movement, the cerebellar machinery may circumvent long delays in cortical feedback loops, serving effective sensory processing and motor control during active whisking (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rahmati et al., 2014</a>). Crucially, our findings confirm that by rendering an internal representation of the whisker system, PC spike train dynamics are highly informative about movement trajectories, facilitating active sensation and tactile exploration."

Prior to recording, mice were anesthetized with 1\u20132% isoflurane under aseptic conditions, and a lightweight head-post was attached to the skull using glue (Histoacryl, Braun Corporation, USA) and acrylic dental cement (Kemdent, UK). A circular chamber was built with cement over the lateral hemisphere of the cerebellum to allow subsequent access for electrophysiological recording. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Carprofen; 5\u00a0mg/kg) was provided via intra-peritoneal administration during surgery to support recovery. Implanted mice were given 2\u20135 days for recovery, during which time Buprenorphine (0.8\u00a0mg/kg) jelly was used for postoperative analgesia. On the day of the recording, mice were first anesthetized with isoflurane (1\u20132%), and a small craniotomy (1\u20131.5 mm) was drilled over lobule Crus I. The dura was removed with fine forceps and the craniotomy was covered with 1.5% low-melting point agar and a silicone-based sealant (Kwik-Cast; World Precision Instruments, USA). Ipsilateral whiskers were partially trimmed with one whisker row left untouched (row C or D). At least two hours following these procedures, habituation and recording sessions were started. Mice were carefully placed on a cylindrical treadmill and the head-post was gently loaded into a fixation clamp to painlessly immobilize the head. At least one hour of habituation was allowed for the mice to be acclimated to the recording environment. Habituated mice showed normal grooming, whisking, and locomotion behaviors on the treadmill. After removal of sealant and agar, recordings were performed in the dark in a single session lasting up to 3\u2009hr."

Video acquisitions were controlled by Streampix 6 software (Norpix, Canada) and externally triggered by TTL pulses generated via the ITC-18 in order to synchronize video and electrophysiological acquisition. Whisker positions were tracked offline using open source software (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clack et al., 2012</a>) - <a href=\"http://whiskertracking.janelia.org\">http://whiskertracking.janelia.org</a> - and transferred into a graphical user interface in MATLAB (Mathworks) for analysis. Whisker azimuth\u00a0angles were measured along the medial-lateral axis (medial-lateral line: 0 degree, forward movement: increasing angle, backward movement: decreasing angle); protraction corresponded to increasing whisker angles. Because whiskers, especially those from the same row, move in synchrony, we used one of the traced whiskers for all the analysis, as changing whisker did not affect the results."

Whisking epochs were further separated into periods of rest and locomotion. Locomotion episodes were identified as treadmill movement lasting at least 100 consecutive frames (400 ms). The traced whisker position was first low-pass filtered at 30\u2009Hz using a 4-pole\u00a0Butterworth filter run in forward and reverse directions, and subsequently up-sampled to 1 kHz. Whisking set point was derived by low-pass filtering whisker angle at cutoff frequency 6\u2009Hz. Rhythmic whisking epochs were isolated to determine phase information and cells with &gt;20 s of rhythmic whisker movement were included to evaluate phase tuning. Whisker phase was defined as the angle of the Hilbert transform on band-pass filtered (6\u201330\u2009Hz) whisker angle. A phase of zero corresponds to maximal protraction and a phase of \u00b1 \u03c0 denotes maximal retraction in a whisk cycle."

On average, 40 episodes of whisking for each cell were used to quantitatively assess how whisking behavior modulated PC firing rate. Spike rates were calculated for individual whisking and non-whisking epochs as the total number of spikes divided by the duration of an epoch. Comparisons of the spike rates were made between quiet epochs and whisking epochs using a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test where p&lt;0.05 was recognized as a significant difference. Overall firing rates during whisking and non-whisking were calculated by averaging the spike rates of all epochs comprising the two respective conditions. To generate peri-event time-histograms, spike trains were aligned by the onsets of whisking bouts and averaged across trials. Corresponding whisking epochs were aligned at the onset and averaged to reveal the mean whisker movement within bouts."

To examine the temporal relationship between SS discharge changes and behavioral transitions, normalized cross-correlations\u00a0between PC instantaneous firing rate and whisker position were computed for individual data segments and averaged across segments. The time at the nearest maxima/minima (peak/trough) above the upper/lower 95% confidence bounds in the normalized cross-correlation provided the temporal delay between the two signals. To test if the latency distribution was non-unimodal, we computed Hartigan\u2019s Dip test on the empirical distribution from -100 ms to 100 ms (n = 38 cells) with 5 or 10 ms bin size."

At starting positions near full protraction or retraction one would expect a contraction of the range. This issue may relate back to (1), as there is some evidence for protractions with running speed (Sofroniew and Svoboda 2015)."

Much in vitro work has revealed non-linear conductances in the dendrites and soma of Purkinje cells (e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated potassium conductances, I<sub>h</sub>, recurrent Na<sup>+</sup> conductance), so we are highlighting that these conductances interact (or less likely, are not active) during whisking in order to maintain linear encoding. Our aim was not to explicitly model this phenomenon, but rather provide evidence from the behaving animal for a proposal that has been previously presented (e.g. Walter and Khodakhah, 2006, 2009). We have amended the text in order to clarify this point in the manuscript (Introduction, third paragraph)."

They found that a large number of Purkinje cells shows (complex and/or simple spike) firing rate modulation during voluntary whisker movements. While the role, if any, of the complex spike rate modulation remains rather elusive, the authors found that simple spike firing is closely related to the set point of the whisker, with a linear encoding of the whisker angle. Although a few recent articles addressed this topic, the role of the cerebellum in the rodent whisker system remains largely unclear. This well-designed and executed study confirms the implication of cerebellar Purkinje cell activity in the whisker system. A number of points require attention before this manuscript could be accepted for publication:1) Locomotion:In this study, the mice are placed on a treadmill. There is quite some evidence that locomotion and whisking are tightly correlated. Nevertheless, the authors do not address this issue.

Given the very small fraction of time mice spent running in our study, we do not believe that locomotion-related changes in firing are a significant confounding factor in our measurement of the relationship between whisking and SS activity. However, in 10 recordings, where we had at least 5 s of running combined with whisking, we were able to measure the influence of locomotion on SS rate changes."

We looked into this issue by plotting gain vs. encoding range, and found a strong inverse relationship (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.75) between the two. Therefore, high-gain PCs encode only a small range of whisker angles. This could indicate that high-gain PCs make a relatively smaller contribution to the representation of whisker position than low-gain PCs. However, when we quantified the fraction of time that a whisker spent within a PC\u2019s linear encoding regime, we found that this was roughly constant across the population, with no relationship to PC gain (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.05). In other words, we observed high-gain PCs when behavior was characterized by bouts of low amplitude whisker movement, and low-gain PCs when behavior was characterized by large movements. These data hint that the gain of whisker encoding may be subject to adaptive changes either within, or upstream of the cerebellar cortex.
