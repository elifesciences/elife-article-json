In this study, we report the structure of <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> HpHbR in complex with human haptoglobin-haemoglobin (HpHb), revealing an elongated ligand-binding site that extends along its membrane distal half. This contacts haptoglobin and the \u03b2-subunit of haemoglobin, showing how the receptor selectively binds HpHb over individual components. Lateral mobility of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HpHbR, and a \u223c50<sup>o</sup> kink in the receptor, allows two receptors to simultaneously bind one HpHb dimer. Indeed, trypanosomes take up dimeric HpHb at significantly lower concentrations than monomeric HpHb, due to increased ligand avidity that comes from bivalent binding. The structure therefore reveals the molecular basis for ligand and innate immunity factor uptake by trypanosomes and identifies adaptations that allow efficient ligand uptake in the context of the complex trypanosome cell surface."

In this study, we report the structure of <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> HpHbR in complex with human haptoglobin-haemoglobin (HpHb), revealing an elongated ligand-binding site that extends along its membrane distal half. This contacts haptoglobin and the \u03b2-subunit of haemoglobin, showing how the receptor selectively binds HpHb over individual components. Lateral mobility of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HpHbR, and a \u223c50<sup>o</sup> kink in the receptor, allows two receptors to simultaneously bind one HpHb dimer. Indeed, trypanosomes take up dimeric HpHb at significantly lower concentrations than monomeric HpHb, due to increased ligand avidity that comes from bivalent binding. The structure therefore reveals the molecular basis for ligand and innate immunity factor uptake by trypanosomes and identifies adaptations that allow efficient ligand uptake in the context of the complex trypanosome cell surface."

Trypanosomes need to get haem\u2014a molecule found in the protein haemoglobin\u2014from their host to survive. In blood plasma, haemoglobin is found associated with a carrier protein called haptoglobin. To acquire haem, the parasites have a protein called HpHbR that binds to these haptoglobin-haemoglobin \u2018complexes\u2019. However, in humans there are two complexes of proteins called TLFs that contain haemoglobin and a protein related to haptoglobin. The TLFs are also able to bind to HpHbR and are taken into the parasite. Once inside, TLFs cause internal compartments called lysosomes to swell, which leads to the death of the trypanosome."

The disease is persistent as the host immune system is usually unable to clear the infection. This is due to the trypanosome having evolved a population survival strategy based on autoregulation of parasitaemia and antigenic variation (<a href=\"#bib26\">MacGregor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Horn, 2014</a>). The trypanosomes also internalize and degrade surface bound immunoglobulin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pal et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Engstler et al., 2007</a>), increasing the survival of an individual cell and thereby increasing the likelihood of transmission. Both of these strategies require a densely packed cell surface coat of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) that acts as a barrier, preventing access of host immunoglobulins to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schwede and Carrington, 2010</a>). This coat also undergoes antigenic variation through expression of a single VSG gene from a genomic repertoire of hundreds (<a href=\"#bib18\">Horn, 2014</a>)."

We also present the structure of TbHpHbR in complex with HpHb, revealing the molecular basis for ligand binding and selectivity. Finally, we show that the kink allows two independent membrane attached receptors to interact with a single dimeric HpHb molecule and confirm using cell uptake experiments that this causes dimeric ligand to be taken up with greater efficiency than monomeric ligand. This reveals the molecular basis for the uptake of HpHb and trypanolytic factor-1 and identifies adaptations in the trypanosome receptor that allow efficient ligand uptake in the context of the tightly packed VSG coat."

Each of the three helices is affected, with the backbone carbonyl groups of Asp88, Ala89, Glu123, Asn124, Asp270 and Ala271 no longer forming hydrogen bonds. This kink is not caused by flexibility, but is a rigid feature of the receptor, as it adopts the same confirmation in crystals of receptor alone, and in crystals of its complex with HpSPHb (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and is also observed in molecular envelopes derived from small angle x-ray scattering (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Instead it is caused by changes in the pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues around the kink site in each of the three helices. The three long helices of the <i>T. congolense</i> receptor are characterised by an alternating pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, leading to continuous hydrophobic strips along the length of each helix that pack in the core of the helical bundle, stabilising its fold. In the <i>T. brucei</i> receptor, this pattern is disturbed at each kink site, breaking the organisation of the helix and leading to an alteration in the surface that displays the hydrophobic patch (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This stabilises the kink and makes it a rigid feature of the receptor structure."

The membrane distal part, (\u223c745 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>) contacts the \u03b2-subunit of the haemoglobin dimer with no contacts between the receptor and the haemoglobin \u03b1-subunit. The membrane proximal region (\u223c505 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>) forms a binding surface for haptoglobin. The involvement of both haemoglobin and haptoglobin in binding explains why the receptor binds HpHb but not haptoglobin alone. Modelling suggests that the lack of haemoglobin binding is due to steric clashes of the receptor with the second \u03b1\u03b2 dimer of haemoglobin when the \u03b2-subunit of a haemoglobin tetramer is docked onto the receptor with the binding mode observed in the TbHpHbR:HpSPHb complex (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

It is therefore initially surprising that the location of the binding site for bulky HpHb complexes extends some 70 \u00c5 from the membrane distal tip of the receptor and below the surface of the VSG layer. However, one consequence of the kink in the <i>T. brucei</i> receptor is to increase its effective diameter, pushing apart VSG molecules. In addition, the orientation of the kink is precisely arranged to increase exposure of the HpHb binding site to the surface, making it more accessible for ligand binding."

This modelling suggests that two receptors can bind simultaneously to a single HpHb dimer, resulting in a C-shaped complex with a parallel arrangement of the membrane proximal parts of the two receptors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Indeed, this arrangement was confirmed in solution by small angle x-ray scattering. Native (dimeric) human HpHb was mixed with TbHpHbR, and gel filtration was performed, with SAXS data collected from samples as they emerged from the column. The resultant scattering curves confirmed the assembly of a complex containing two receptors and one HpHb in vitro. These data were used to generate a molecular envelope for the complex, which confirmed the C-shaped architecture (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Additional support for the formation of this complex in solution came from multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS), which revealed masses of 30 kDa for the receptor, 150 kDa for HpHb and 210 kDa for the complex, showing that two receptors bind to each HpHb in solution (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This arrangement, in which two independent GPI-anchored receptors can bind simultaneously to an HpHb dimer, would increase avidity for the ligand and decrease the ligand concentration required for efficient uptake."

As the monovalent affinities of the receptor for HpHb and HpSPHb are indistinguishable, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, this suggests that more efficient uptake of HpHb is caused by the dimeric ligand simultaneously binding to two receptors. Indeed, measurements of the binding of HpHb to immobilised receptor, using a very high surface density of HpHbR to measure bivalent binding, gave an affinity of 4.5 nM (<a href=\"#bib16\">Higgins et al., 2013</a>), which is in the same range as the concentration at which HpHb uptake becomes saturated in live parasites. Therefore, it appears as though TbHpHbR has evolved a kink to increase accessibility of its ligand-binding site and to allow simultaneous binding of two receptors to one HpHb ligand, increasing ligand avidity and uptake efficiency."

Firstly, the direction of the kink is precisely arranged to bend the receptor such that the ligand-binding site becomes more exposed at the membrane surface. The kink will also increase the effective diameter of the receptor in the plane of the membrane. This combination is likely to increase the separation of VSG molecules in the region of the receptor and to increase the accessibility of the binding site for bulky macromolecular ligands such as HpHb and trypanolytic factors. Increased separation of VSG molecules by a trypanosome receptor is not a novel phenomena, with bulky glycan chains attached to the transferrin receptor proposed to have a similar effect (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mehlert et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that different receptors increase the accessibility of binding sites for bulky ligands by different means."

However, the dimensions of the structures of VSG and the TbHpHbR:HpHb complex suggest that this may not be the case and that the HpHb ligand is held at least partially within the VSG layer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

This is an important interaction in trypanosome molecular biology, as it allows the parasite to acquire haem, and it is relevant to the innate immune response humans have to many species of trypanosome parasites. While the structures of the individual components were largely known previously, the details of their complex were hitherto unknown and are revealed for the first time here. The biological experiments, demonstrating the different efficiencies of receptor-mediated uptake of monomeric and dimeric HpHb ligands are an important component of the paper that nicely supports the structure-based hypotheses on increased ligand avidity made possible by a 'two receptors bind one ligand dimer' model."

Assuming that the receptors are predominantly localised at the flagellar pocket, and using the known receptor copy number and VSG diffusion rates, we have calculated that each receptor should contact another receptor approximately once each second. As the t<sub>1/2</sub> for the dissociation of HpHb from a single receptor is in the region of 70-100 s, there is a strong likelihood that an HpHb attached to a single receptor will interact with a second receptor before it dissociates, leading to higher avidity bivalent binding. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion section to make this point."

The envelopes derived from these data, together with the accompanying molecular weights, support the binding of two receptors to each HpHb. In addition, we have included SEC-MALLS data, which also shows the formation of a complex containing two receptors bound to a single HpHb. These biophysical data support the conclusions derived from crystallography and explain the in vivo effects observed in HpHb uptake experiments."
