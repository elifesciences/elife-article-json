Available microbicides that target viral components have proven largely ineffective in preventing sexual virus transmission. In this study, we establish that CLR01, a \u2018molecular tweezer\u2019 specific for lysine and arginine residues, inhibits the formation of infectivity-enhancing seminal amyloids and remodels preformed fibrils. Moreover, CLR01 abrogates semen-mediated enhancement of viral infection by preventing the formation of virion\u2013amyloid complexes and by directly disrupting the membrane integrity of HIV and other enveloped viruses. We establish that CLR01 acts by binding to the target lysine and arginine residues rather than by a non-specific, colloidal mechanism. CLR01 counteracts both host factors that may be important for HIV transmission and the pathogen itself. These combined anti-amyloid and antiviral activities make CLR01 a promising topical microbicide for blocking infection by HIV and other sexually transmitted viruses."

Available microbicides that target viral components have proven largely ineffective in preventing sexual virus transmission. In this study, we establish that CLR01, a \u2018molecular tweezer\u2019 specific for lysine and arginine residues, inhibits the formation of infectivity-enhancing seminal amyloids and remodels preformed fibrils. Moreover, CLR01 abrogates semen-mediated enhancement of viral infection by preventing the formation of virion\u2013amyloid complexes and by directly disrupting the membrane integrity of HIV and other enveloped viruses. We establish that CLR01 acts by binding to the target lysine and arginine residues rather than by a non-specific, colloidal mechanism. CLR01 counteracts both host factors that may be important for HIV transmission and the pathogen itself. These combined anti-amyloid and antiviral activities make CLR01 a promising topical microbicide for blocking infection by HIV and other sexually transmitted viruses."

Semen contains deposits of protein fragments called amyloid fibrils, which can increase the transmission of HIV by trapping viral particles. This helps the virus to attach to the membranes surrounding human cells, which increases the risk of infection. Therefore, therapies that reduce the levels of amyloid fibrils in semen might be able to reduce the transmission of HIV."

Far from being a passive vehicle, semen potently enhances HIV infectivity (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). This HIV-enhancing activity is attributed to seminal amyloid fibrils (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Roan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Usmani et al., 2014</a>) that form by self-assembly of proteolytic fragments of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP248-286 and PAP85-120) and the homologous proteins semenogelin 1 (SEM1) and semenogelin 2 (SEM2) (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Roan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arnold et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2014</a>). Seminal amyloid fibrils are highly cationic, and the positively charged fibrils capture HIV virions, increase viral attachment rates to target cells, and augment fusion (<a href=\"#bib68\">Roan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arnold et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Usmani et al., 2014</a>). By doing so, fibrils promote HIV infection in vitro by several orders of magnitude, whereas the corresponding monomeric peptides have no effect (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Roan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arnold et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, the stimulatory effect of seminal amyloid is the greatest at low virus concentrations (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2007</a>), and semen and PAP248-286 fibrils (termed SEVI for Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection) may facilitate vaginal virus transmission after exposure to low viral doses (<a href=\"#bib47\">Miller et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Neildez et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2013</a>). HIV transmission rates are relatively low, occurring as infrequently as 1 in 200 to as low as 1 in 10,000 coital acts (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gray et al., 2001</a>). Thus, counteraction of infectivity promoting amyloids in semen should reduce or even prevent HIV transmission via the sexual route."

Furthermore, CLR01 has even been found to slowly remodel preformed A\u03b2 and \u03b1-synuclein fibrils over the course of several weeks (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</a>). CLR01 binds lysine residues with a <i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> of \u223c10 \u00b5M and also binds arginine residues, albeit with \u223c10-fold lower affinity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fokkens et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dutt et al., 2013</a>). The unprecedented high specificity of CLR01 for basic amino acids relies on a unique binding mode in which the tweezer draws the cationic side chains into its torus-shaped cavity and engages the ammonium cation of lysine or the guanidinium cation of arginine with its anionic phosphate group in a tight ion pair (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kl\u00e4rner and Schrader, 2013</a>). No other amino acids fulfill the requirements for this threading mechanism. The structure of the CLR01-lysine complex and the precise mechanism of lysine threading into the CLR01 guest cavity and subsequent ion pairing have been extensively characterized by NMR spectroscopy, crystal structure, molecular dynamics, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bier et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dutt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kl\u00e4rner and Schrader, 2013</a>). Importantly, CLR01 appears only to complex with readily accessible lysine or arginine residues on protein surfaces, as evidenced by crystal structures and NMR experiments (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bier et al., 2013</a>). This restriction makes CLR01 more selective for lysine or arginine residues found in intrinsically unfolded proteins or protein sequences."

Strikingly, CLR01 also exhibits a direct antiviral effect by selectively disrupting the membrane of enveloped viruses. Thus, CLR01 represents an unprecedented candidate for further development as a microbicide as it not only inactivates HIV and other enveloped viruses but also antagonizes host-encoded seminal amyloids that enhance viral infection."

Moreover, the wealth of basic residues in PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>) led us to hypothesize that the lysine- and arginine-specific tweezer, CLR01, but not its derivative CLR03, which lacks hydrophobic sidewalls (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), might bind to these residues and interfere with fibril assembly. To test this hypothesis, we first performed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations using the available structure of PAP248-286, the best characterized of the amyloid-forming peptides in semen (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">French and Makhatadze, 2012</a>). This analysis revealed that in silico, CLR01 bound at least seven of the eight positively charged residues in PAP248-286 without grossly altering peptide secondary structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Indeed, CLR01 engaged Lys251, Lys253, Lys281, and Lys282 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>), which all reside in predicted steric zippers (<a href=\"#bib9\">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Moreover, CLR01 bound Arg257, Lys281, and Lys282 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>), which form part of the cross-\u03b2 SEVI fibril core defined by hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange (<a href=\"#bib17\">French and Makhatadze, 2012</a>). The CLR01 interaction was very similar among all the different lysine and arginine binding sites as indicated by similar (X-P) distances between the lysine ammonium or arginine guanidinium groups (X) and the bound phosphate group (P) in CLR01 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). By contrast, CLR03 only established more distant and variable interactions with lysine and arginine residues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Thus, CLR01 but not CLR03 tightly shielded lysine and arginine residues in PAP248-286 suggesting that CLR01 could prevent PAP248-286 assembly into SEVI fibrils."

Using the fluorescence of the diagnostic dye Thioflavin-T (ThT), which increases upon amyloid binding, we found that CLR01, but not CLR03, inhibited fibril assembly of all three peptides (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) of CLR01 inhibition of PAP248-286 and SEM1(45-107) fibrillization were \u223c1.19 \u00b5M and \u223c16.2 \u00b5M, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F</a>). The IC<sub>50</sub> for inhibition of PAP248-286 fibrillization was significantly lower than the IC<sub>50</sub> for inhibition of SEM1(45-107) fibrillization (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that lysine, arginine, or both residues are more critical for PAP248-286 fibrillization. Moreover, inhibition of PAP248-286 and SEM1(45-107) fibrillization exhibited shallow dose\u2013response curves with Hill slopes of \u223c0.6 for PAP248-286 and \u223c0.44 for SEM1(45-107) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F</a>), indicating negative co-operativity or CLR01 binding to multiple sites with different affinities. Importantly, these shallow dose responses provide evidence against a non-specific mechanism of inhibition involving colloidal CLR01 aggregates, as aggregating inhibitors tend to exhibit steep dose response curves (<a href=\"#bib71\">Shoichet, 2006</a>). The IC<sub>50</sub> of CLR01 to impede PAP85-120 assembly was significantly higher at \u223c228 \u00b5M (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.0001; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The higher IC<sub>50</sub> is likely due to the lower number of lysine or arginine residues in the PAP85-120 sequence located in hexapeptides predicted to have high amyloid propensity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</a>). Indeed, PAP85-120 has 1 lysine or arginine located in predicted steric zippers, whereas PAP248-286 has 4 and SEM1(45-107) has 3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The Hill slope was \u223c1.26, indicating weak positive co-operativity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), but was still below the \u223c1.5\u20132 range that might indicate a mechanism of inhibition involving colloidal CLR01 aggregates (<a href=\"#bib71\">Shoichet, 2006</a>)."

PAP248-286(Ala) formed amyloid fibrils in the presence of CLR01, CLR03, and buffer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). To further analyze the effect of CLR01 on PAP248-286(Ala) assembly, we employed a sedimentation assay. This assay revealed that equal amounts of PAP248-286(Ala) entered the pellet fraction when the peptide was incubated with buffer or CLR01, indicating that the formation of PAP248-286(Ala) amyloid fibrils is unaffected by CLR01 treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Thus, it is likely that in the presence of CLR01, PAP248-286(Ala) assembles into a subtly distinct set of cross-beta structures or fibril \u2018strains\u2019 that are less ThT-reactive (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). Amyloidogenesis by PAP85-120(Ala) was also unaffected by CLR01 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). The PAP248-286(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) peptides spontaneously assemble into amyloid more rapidly than the wild-type peptides (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,G,I</a>). However, we have been unable to establish conditions (e.g., higher CLR01 concentrations) where CLR01 prevents assembly of PAP248-286(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) into amyloid fibrils (data not shown).

Remarkably, in addition to obstructing unseeded PAP248-286 assembly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), CLR01 also completely inhibited seeded fibrillization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a>). Dose\u2013response analysis established an IC<sub>50</sub> of \u223c15.3 \u00b5M for CLR01 inhibition of seeded PAP248-286 assembly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>) compared to \u223c1.19 \u00b5M for spontaneous PAP248-286 assembly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Thus, higher concentrations of CLR01 are required to inhibit PAP248-286 assembly once SEVI fibrils have formed. Interestingly, the Hill slope for inhibition of seeded PAP248-286 assembly was \u223c3.1 indicating positive co-operativity and was steeper than the Hill slope of \u223c0.6 for inhibition of spontaneous PAP248-286 fibrillization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,L</a>). This dissimilarity might indicate a mechanistic difference in how CLR01 inhibits seeded and spontaneous PAP248-286 fibrillization. However, this difference is not likely to be due colloidal CLR01 aggregates, as inhibition of seeded assembly by CLR01 was unaffected by BSA or by preclearing CLR01 solutions via centrifugation (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Rather, we suggest that the CLR01-mediated inhibition of fibril elongation in seeded SEVI assembly has requirements distinct from the CLR01-mediated inhibition of initial fibril nucleation in spontaneous, unseeded SEVI assembly."

Importantly, because CLR01 impedes both unseeded and seeded PAP248-286 assembly, it likely acts at multiple stages of the fibrillization process including the initial nucleation and fibril elongation steps. These observations also indicate that lysine, arginine, or both residues play an important role in the primary nucleation and subsequent elongation of PAP248\u2013286 fibrils."

Thus, agents that not only inhibit fibril formation but also remodel preformed fibrils would be advantageous for microbicide development (<a href=\"#bib9\">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</a>). To test whether CLR01 could remodel seminal amyloid, SEVI, PAP85-120 and SEM1(45-107) fibrils were treated with CLR01 or CLR03, and ThT fluorescence intensity was monitored. Brief incubations with CLR01 (10\u201320 min) had no effect, indicating that CLR01 did not simply displace ThT from fibrils (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). After 2 hr, however, CLR01 treatment of SEVI (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and PAP85-120 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) but not SEM1(45-107) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) fibrils resulted in a reduction in ThT fluorescence intensity by more than 50%. Even after 24 hr, SEM1(45-107) fibrils were not remodeled by CLR01 (data not shown). SEVI and PAP85-120 fibril remodeling was confirmed by TEM, which showed few intact fibrils and predominately smaller nonfibrillar species after CLR01 treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). By contrast, TEM revealed that SEM1(45-107) fibrils were still abundant after prolonged CLR01 treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This observation confirms that CLR01 does not simply prevent fibrils from adsorbing to the EM grid (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similar results were obtained by fluorescence microscopy (CoM) of samples stained with Proteostat, a red fluorescent aggregate sensing dye (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib80\">Usmani et al., 2014</a>). These effects of CLR01 were remarkably rapid in comparison to the slow disassembly of A\u03b2 or \u03b1-synuclein fibrils by CLR01, which required several weeks (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</a>). Thus, CLR01 can remodel SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils on a time scale that would be useful for prevention of HIV infection, which usually takes place within the first hours after deposition of semen in the anogenital tract (<a href=\"#bib70\">Shattock and Moore, 2003</a>)."

By contrast, SEVI fibrils incubated with CLR01 showed a loss in the \u03b2-sheet minimum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>), confirming that CLR01 alters the cross-\u03b2 architecture of SEVI fibrils. Furthermore, SEVI fibrils remodeled by CLR01 were less effective seeds for polymerization of monomeric PAP248-286 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>).

Interestingly, in both cases the Hill slope was similar, approximately \u22120.6 for SEVI and approimately \u22120.726 for PAP85-120, indicating negative co-operativity or CLR01 binding to multiple sites with different affinities. These shallow dose\u2013response curves provide evidence against a colloidal mechanism of CLR01 action (<a href=\"#bib71\">Shoichet, 2006</a>). Previous studies have reported that a 10-fold molar excess of CLR01 could remodel preformed A\u03b240, A\u03b242, or \u03b1-synuclein fibrils slowly over a time period of weeks (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</a>).

CLR01 was unable to remodel preformed SEVI(Ala) or PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013L</a>). Indeed, we have been unable to establish conditions (e.g., higher CLR01 concentrations) where CLR01 remodels SEVI(Ala) or PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils (data not shown). Furthermore, addition of excess free lysine or poly-L-lysine to CLR01 prevented its SEVI and PAP85-120 amyloid-remodeling activity (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, CLR01-lysine, CLR01-arginine, or both contacts are critical for the remodeling process. By contrast, CLR01 retained SEVI and PAP85-120 amyloid-remodeling activity in the presence of BSA (10 mg/ml) or if CLR01 solutions were precleared via centrifugation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, colloidal CLR01 aggregates do not contribute to the amyloid-remodeling activity of CLR01. Taken together, our findings suggest that the lysine- and arginine-specific molecular tweezer CLR01 prevents formation of seminal amyloid and remodels mature PAP85-120 and SEVI fibrils via binding to lysine and arginine residues."

To prevent fibril remodeling from occurring in these experiments, fibrils were mixed with CLR01, CLR03, or buffer, and samples were immediately centrifuged to remove unbound CLR01 and CLR03 molecules. Subsequently, the surface charge of resuspended fibrils was determined by zeta potential measurements. We found that CLR01, but not CLR03, neutralized the positive surface charge of SEVI, PAP85-120, and SEM1(49-107) fibrils within minutes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

We found that treatment of virions with CLR01 did not affect virion fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) or the number of fluorescent particles (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, CLR01-treated virions were dispersed throughout the chamber indicating that their biophysical properties might be altered (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Our results demonstrate that CLR01 not only prevents the interaction of fibrils with virions but also displaces viral particles from preformed fibril\u2013virion complexes."

First, we analyzed possible cytotoxic effects of the tweezer in TZM-bl cells, a HIV reporter cell line commonly used to study virus infection (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Usmani et al., 2014</a>).

This effect was independent of the presence of viral glycoproteins, since CLR01 also destroyed HIV-1 particles lacking gp120/41 (\u2206env) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting that CLR01 disrupts the integrity of the viral membrane."

Viral membranes differ from cellular membranes in that they are two to threefold enriched in specific lipids, such as sphingomyelin and cholesterol, which can form microdomains termed lipid rafts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aloia et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lorizate et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gerl et al., 2012</a>). We hypothesized that CLR01 might selectively disrupt lipid-raft enriched membranes. To test this hypothesis, dye-loaded giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) were generated that consisted of either 1,2-dioleoyl-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) to recapitulate a bilayer devoid of lipid rafts or a mixture of DOPC, sphingomyelin and cholesterol (DOPC/SM/Chol) to more closely resemble a lipid raft-rich viral membrane. Strikingly, CLR01 permeabilized the model viral membrane within 5\u201310 min while exhibiting no effect on the DOPC membrane, even after 60 min of incubation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). These results were confirmed by AFM at higher spatial resolution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). CLR01 treatment of a DOPC membrane that was deposited on mica surface did not affect bilayer stability, and the tweezer (white dots in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) was homogenously distributed on the scan area. By contrast, the DOPC/SM/Chol raft mixture appeared as coexisting liquid-disordered (l<sub>d</sub>) and liquid-ordered (l<sub>o</sub>) domains, and CLR01 addition induced changes in phase coexistence and decreased height differences between both phases. After 60 min, distinct l<sub>d</sub> and l<sub>o</sub> domains were no longer visible, and CLR01 was homogenously distributed in the remaining fluid phase. Collectively, these data suggest that CLR01 selectively disrupts heterogeneous lipid-raft enriched membranes."

Microcalorimetric dilution titrations revealed only minute endothermic heat changes, which argue strongly against an extensive aggregation process (data not shown). Pyrene fluorescence revealed that no critical micelle concentration (cmc) could be determined in a wide concentration range (0\u20130.5 mM CLR01) encompassing fibril assembly and remodeling conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments showed CLR01 particles with hydrodynamic radius <i>R</i><sub>H</sub> = 5\u20138 nm in PBS at concentration between 200 and 1000 \u03bcM, plus a very minor fraction of particles with a <i>R</i><sub>H</sub> = 20\u201340 nm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>; data not shown). We did not observe CLR01 particles with a <i>R</i><sub>H</sub> of \u223c95\u2013400 nm, which is the size range typically associated with colloidal small-molecule aggregates (<a href=\"#bib43\">McGovern et al., 2002</a>). No CLR01 particles could be detected at 10 or 50 \u03bcM in PBS (data not shown). In HEPES buffer, no particles were detected at any of the concentration tested (between 10 and 1000 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>; data not shown). The \u223c0.9\u20131 nm hydrodynamic radius of CLR01 revealed by DOSY (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>) is below the detection limit of our DLS instrument, and hence, we cannot resolve the CLR01 monomer (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Importantly, DLS overemphasizes large particles because the scattered-light intensity is proportional to the square of the particle mass. The scattering intensity in the solutions of CLR01 (1 mM) in PBS was \u223c3% that of similar samples containing Mg<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>) colloids (10 mM Mg<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)) or SDS micelles (2% SDS (wt/vol)), suggesting that the observed species represented a small fraction of the CLR01 molecules (data not shown). Thus, under all assay concentrations the vast majority of the tweezer molecules are monomeric. Minute amounts of dimers or higher order species may be present at high concentrations of CLR01 in some cases in PBS (fibril assembly buffer) but are absent from the HEPES buffer (fibril remodeling buffer). Thus, it is highly unlikely that colloidal CLR01 aggregates contribute to the observed activity of the tweezer."

This bodily fluid is not only the main vector for HIV transmission but also contains cationic amyloid fibrils that markedly increase viral infectivity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2014</a>). Various biological polyanions such as heparin or other glycosaminoglycans can prevent these cationic fibrils from enhancing HIV infection (<a href=\"#bib68\">Roan et al., 2009</a>). Unfortunately, however, such anionic polymers have been unsuccessful in past clinical microbicide trials due to their poor bioavailability and induction of inflammatory responses in the genital tract, which actually augment HIV transmission by recruiting HIV-susceptible target cells to the genital mucosa (<a href=\"#bib40\">L\u00fcscher-Mattli, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">van de Wijgert and Shattock, 2007</a>).

These diverse activities made us concerned that CLR01 might disrupt amyloidogenesis and viral infection via a non-specific mechanism involving the formation of colloidal CLR01 aggregates (<a href=\"#bib43\">McGovern et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Shoichet, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Feng et al., 2008</a>). Nevertheless, multiple lines of evidence argue against a non-specific, colloidal mechanism of CLR01 activity. First, using a variety of biophysical techniques, we were unable to detect significant quantities of colloidal CLR01 aggregates under the conditions employed in our experiments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Second, the anti-amyloid and antiviral activity of CLR01 was unaffected by high concentrations of BSA (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 and 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), which would adsorb and quench the activity of any potential colloidal micelles (<a href=\"#bib43\">McGovern et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Feng et al., 2008</a>). Third, attempts to preclear CLR01 solutions by centrifugation to remove any colloidal aggregates (<a href=\"#bib44\">McGovern et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Feng et al., 2008</a>) had no effect on CLR01 anti-amyloid or antiviral activity (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Fourth, the shallow CLR01 dose\u2013response curves are not typical of colloidal aggregate inhibitors, which typically exhibit steep dose\u2013response curves (<a href=\"#bib71\">Shoichet, 2006</a>). Finally, a feature of small molecules that form colloidal aggregates is that they are non-specific inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib43\">McGovern et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Feng et al., 2008</a>). By contrast, CLR01 displays specificity for amyloidogenesis by peptides that harbor lysine and arginine residues. Thus, if the lysine and arginine residues of PAP248-286 or PAP85-120 are replaced with alanine, then CLR01 can neither inhibit fibril assembly nor remodel preformed fibrils (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2G\u2013I, 3I\u2013L</a>). Likewise, the antiviral activity of CLR01 is restricted to enveloped viruses and CLR01 is ineffective against non-enveloped viruses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This specificity is inconsistent with an indiscriminate, non-specific mechanism of action mediated by colloidal CLR01 aggregates. Importantly, the anti-amyloid and antiviral activity of CLR01 could be eliminated by excess lysine or poly-L-lysine. Thus, the lysine-binding cavity of CLR01 plays an important role in both anti-amyloid and antiviral activity."

Here, it is important to consider the profound difference between freely accessible lysines on intrinsically unstructured domains, which can all be complexed by the tweezers, and lysines in folded proteins whose surface often prohibits the sterically demanding tweezer molecule to approach a lysine residue close enough for the threading mechanism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The interaction between free lysine and CLR01 has a <i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> of \u223c10 \u00b5M, with fast on and off rates (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fokkens et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bier et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dutt et al., 2013</a>). On folded proteins, however, only a few lysines are accessible for the relatively large molecular skeleton of the tweezers. For example, only 5 of 17 surface lysines in a 14-3-3 protein are most likely to be complexed by CLR01 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bier et al., 2013</a>). Even in an unstructured small protein, such as A\u03b2, CLR01 has clear preference for the free Lys16 over Lys28 (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>) because the latter is engaged in stabilizing hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges (<a href=\"#bib62\">Petkova et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lazo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Xiao et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, because of the high on and off rates, CLR01 is expected to only disrupt relatively weak interactions as well as events that depend on critical and accessible lysine or arginine residues. Therefore, the tweezer has shown selectivity in multiple cases that on first impression may appear counter-intuitive. For example, inhibition of abnormal protein aggregation is typically achieved at \u223c1:1\u20131:5 protein:CLR01 concentration (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib73\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acharya et al., 2014</a>), whereas disruption of controlled protein polymerization, for example, of tubulin, requires \u223c55-fold excess CLR01 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Attar et al., 2014</a>) and enzyme inhibition requires \u223c1000-fold excess CLR01 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Talbiersky et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, in vivo, CLR01 shows no toxicity at doses 2\u20133 orders of magnitude above those needed to enable clearance of amyloid (<a href=\"#bib5\">Attar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Attar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ferreira et al., 2014</a>). Thus, selectivity for lysine-bearing amyloid conformers in complex biological fluids is achieved by CLR01."

Remarkably, substoichiometric CLR01 concentrations (relative to peptide monomers) also sufficed to effectively remodel SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>). Curiously, SEM1(45-107) fibrils could not be remodeled by CLR01. Why SEM1(45-107) fibrils were refractory to CLR01 remains unclear and requires further study. CLR01 may require longer time periods to remodel SEM1(45-107) fibrils as with remodeling of A\u03b2 fibrils, which required several weeks (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>). It will also be important to determine whether some lysine and arginine residues in PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) are more critical than others for CLR01 activity."

Since the CLR03 control, which has a similar negative charge as CLR01 (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>), was entirely ineffective at blocking viral infection, a purely polyanion-like mechanism that prevents the interaction of virions and cells by increasing charge repulsions (<a href=\"#bib54\">Neurath et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Weber et al., 2005</a>) could be excluded. Instead, we demonstrate that CLR01 selectively disrupts membranes containing elevated levels of sphingomyelin and cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Envelopes of HIV-1, herpes viruses, and HCV differ significantly from the cellular plasma membrane as they are more highly enriched in these and other lipids (<a href=\"#bib83\">van Genderen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lorizate et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Merz et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, the HIV membrane possesses a highly unusual lipid composition, which is distinct even from the detergent-resistant microdomains typically found in the plasma membrane, indicating that HIV budding involves a specific lipid raft clustering process (<a href=\"#bib8\">Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006</a>). For example, although HIV membrane resembles lipid raft microdomains in that it is enriched for saturated lipids, phosphatidylserine, plasmalogen-phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol, and sphingolipids, it is also enriched for the unusual sphingolipid dihydrosphingomyelin (<a href=\"#bib8\">Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lorizate et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2013</a>).

Thus, CLR01 might leverage a therapeutic opportunity provided by the physiological difference between static viral membranes and biogenic cellular membranes capable of self-repair. Static viral membranes are unable to withstand disruption by CLR01, whereas cells can likely repair lipid-raft-rich regions of the plasma membrane that might be disrupted by CLR01. In this regard, CLR01 may possess similarities to other broad-spectrum antivirals such as LJ001, a lipophilic aryl methyldiene rhodanine derivative, which selectively disrupt diverse viral membranes but are ineffective against non-enveloped viruses, and also do not disrupt cell membranes (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wojcechowskyj and Doms, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Wolf et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Vigant et al., 2013</a>). We investigated whether the tweezer might recognize the charged lipid head groups but found via NMR chemical-shift experiments that this was not the case (data not shown). However, experiments on various phase boundaries strongly indicated that the tweezer could migrate into lipid bilayers due to its amphiphilic character (data not shown). A pronounced destabilizing effect may be triggered if this happens at the edge of lipid rafts that are enriched in virion membranes. Importantly, HSV-2, HCMV, and HCV can also be transmitted via sexual intercourse (<a href=\"#bib23\">Handsfield et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rapp, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Tedder et al., 1991</a>).

On a minute time frame, the tweezer destroys infectious HIV particles that are present in semen, prevents the formation of amyloid\u2013virus complexes by neutralization of the fibril surface charge, and also displaces pre-bound virions from fibrils (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). On a longer time frame (hours), CLR01 not only prevents the formation of infection-enhancing seminal amyloids upon ejaculation but also remodels fibrils that are already abundant in semen after ejaculation or formed during semen liquefaction (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Given the time frame of these effects, we suggest that the primary mechanism of CLR01 action is via its direct effect on the virus, and that the anti-amyloid effects, although potent, play a secondary role. Regardless, these combined antiviral and anti-amyloid activities and the encouraging safety data make CLR01 a promising broad-spectrum, topical microbicide against HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted viruses. We anticipate that large-scale synthesis of CLR01 could be relatively inexpensive (less than $1 per mg), which would enable facile development as a broad-spectrum antiviral microbicide."

Then, 50 \u00b5l of 3\u00d7 sample buffer (6% SDS, 187.5 mM Tris, 30% glycerol, 10% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8) was added to the supernatant and pellet fractions. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10\u201320% Tris-Tricine peptide gels and XT Tricine running buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and visualized by coomassie staining. A gradient of soluble peptide controls were also run on the gels. Densitometry (using Image J software) was used to quantify the percent of protein in the pellet fractions by comparing to a standard curve created from the soluble peptide controls. For amyloid-remodeling experiments, fibrils (20 \u00b5M, based on peptide monomer concentrations) were diluted into an assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM KOAc, 10 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) in the presence of ATP (5 mM) and incubated with either CLR01 or CLR03. Aliquots (5 \u00b5l) were removed at various time points and added to 25 \u00b5M ThT in PBS (55 \u00b5l). ThT fluorescence was measured as above. The artificial semen simulant was prepared as described previously (<a href=\"#bib59\">Owen and Katz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Olsen et al., 2012</a>), and is comprised of: 18 mM citrate; 40 mM chloride; 7 mM calcium; 4.5 mM magnesium; 28 mM potassium; 220 mM sodium; 2 mM zinc; 15 mM fructose; 6 mM glucose; 50.4 mg/ml BSA; 7 mM lactic acid; 7.5 mM urea; all in a 123 mM sodium phosphate base, pH 7.7. In some fibril assembly and remodeling experiments, BSA (10 mg/ml) was also included. To assess any contribution of potential colloidal CLR01 aggregates, CLR01 was first reconstituted at the requisite concentration for fibril assembly or remodeling reactions, and then centrifuged at 16,100\u00d7<i>g</i> for 20 min at 25\u00b0C. The supernatant fraction was then collected and used in fibril assembly or remodeling reactions. For some fibril assembly and remodeling reactions, CLR01 was incubated with a 200-fold molar excess of L-lysine or 10-fold molar excess of poly-L-lysine (molecular weight 4000\u201315,000 by viscosity) for 10 min on ice prior to addition to unassembled peptide or preformed fibrils. To determine IC<sub>50</sub> or EC<sub>50</sub> values and Hill slopes for dose\u2013response relationships, the data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. A nonlinear regression analysis (log(inhibitor) vs response\u2013variable slope) was used and fitted with the least squares (ordinary) fit."

A solution of pure DOPC-containing 0.2 mol% <i>N</i>-Rh-DHPE or a lipid mixture of DOPC/SM/Chol (45/25/30 mol%) containing 0.2 mol% <i>N</i>-Rh-DHPE and 0.1 mol% Bodipy-Chol in chloroform was spread on an ITO-coated cover slip (20 \u03bcl, 1 mg/ml), spin-coated at 800 rpm for 1 min, and subsequently dried under vacuum for at least 2 hr. Afterwards, the lipids were hydrated in 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.6, containing the water-soluble fluorophore ATTO 647 (5 \u03bcM) within the preparation chamber. The electroformation of pure DOPC and the DOPC/SM/cholesterol mixture was performed at room temperature and 60\u00b0C, respectively, by applying a frequency alternating current field (500 Hz, 100 mV for 10 min, 1 V for 20 min and 1.6 V for 2.5 hr) to the ITO electrodes by a function generator (Thurlby Thandar Instruments TG315). Afterwards, the preparation chamber was cooled down to room temperature in the case of the lipid mixture and carefully rinsed with 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.6, to remove the water-soluble ATTO 647 that was not enclosed in the interior of the vesicles. Once a region of interest for imaging of the GUVs was chosen under the microscope, \u223c500 \u00b5l of CLR01 (150 \u00b5M) in 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.6, was added. Images were recorded by a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Biorad MRC 1024) coupled via a side port to an inverted microscope (Nikon; Eclipse TE-300DV) enabling fluorescence excitation in the focal plane of an objective lens (Nikon Plan Apo 60\u00d7 WI, NA 1.2). Fluorescence of Bodipy-Chol, <i>N</i>-Rh-DHPE, and ATTO 647 was sequentially acquired by alternating the excitation with the 488, 568, and 647 nm lines of a Kr/Ar laser (Dynamic Laser, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). Signals were detected in three different PMT channels (emission band pass filters 522 nm/FWHM [full width at half-maximum] 35 nm, 580 nm/FWHM 32 nm, and 680 nm/FWHM 32 nm). Image acquisition was controlled by the software LaserSharp2000 (Biorad). Analysis of the data was performed using the software Fiji (Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science e.V., Munich, Germany). Images were background and brightness/contrast corrected."

Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, chloroform, and cholesterol (Chol) were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Steinheim, BW, Germany). Stock solutions of 10 mg/ml lipids (DOPC, SM, Chol) in chloroform were dissolved to obtain 1.95 mg of total lipid with the composition of DOPC (100 mol%) and DOPC/SM/Chol (45/25/30 mol%) for the liquid AFM experiments. The majority of the chloroform was evaporated with a nitrogen stream and the rest of the solvent was removed afterwards by drying under vacuum overnight. The sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer was filtered through filters of 0.02-\u00b5m pore size (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) before use. The dry lipid films were hydrated with 1 ml of 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.6. Afterwards, the lipid mixtures were vortexed, kept in a water bath at 65\u00b0C for 15 min, and then sonicated for 10 min. After five freeze-thaw-vortex cycles and brief sonication, large multilamellar vesicles were formed and transformed to large unilamellar vesicles of uniform size by use of an extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, USA) with polycarbonate membranes of 100 nm pore size at 65\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib87\">Weise et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib86\">2011</a>). The vesicle fusion on mica was carried out by depositing 35 \u00b5l of the extruded lipid vesicle solution together with 35 \u00b5l of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer on freshly cleaved mica and incubation in a wet chamber at 70\u00b0C for 2 hr. After the vesicle fusion, the samples were rinsed carefully with NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer to remove unspread vesicles. For the tweezer\u2013membrane interaction studies, 800 \u00b5l of 150 \u00b5M CLR01 in NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer were slowly injected into the AFM fluid cell at room temperature and allowed to incubate for different time periods (1 min and 1 hr). Afterwards, the fluid cell was rinsed carefully with NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer before imaging to remove unbound tweezer. The measurements were performed on a MultiMode scanning probe microscope with a NanoScope IIIa controller (Bruker, Camarillo, CA, USA) and usage of a J-Scanner (scan size 125 \u00b5m). Images were obtained by applying the tapping mode in liquid with sharp nitride lever (SNL) probes mounted in a fluid cell (Bruker, Camarillo, CA, USA). Tips with nominal force constants of 0.24 N m<sup>\u22121</sup> were used at driving frequencies around 9 kHz and drive amplitudes between 343 and 570 mV. Slow scan frequencies between 1.0 kHz and 1.97 kHz were required for high-resolution images. The height and phase images of sample regions were acquired with resolutions of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels. All AFM measurements were carried out at room temperature and the partitioning of the tweezer was analyzed by using analysis and NanoScope version 5 processing software (<a href=\"#bib87\">Weise et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib86\">2011</a>)."

Colloidal aggregation of organic small molecules can disrupt protein fibrils, by protein sequestration by the colloid (Feng et al., Nature Chem. Biol., 2008). Such a mechanism must be controlled for, especially given the peculiar efficacy of the compounds against the virion membranes themselves. Second, the authors should look to see if free lysine competes for CLR01 binding, disrupting its ability to act on the fibrils and the virions. There are few statistical analyses performed, so the relevance of comparing EC50 values is often unclear. On top of that, many of the raw data sets are of too low quality to produce accurate EC50 values, e.g. the lack of a saturation plateau.

If the data hold up after these controls, then I am enthusiastic. Amyloid fibrils in seminal fluid composed of at least 4 cationic proteins are established to enhance HIV transmission through intercourse by binding virons augmenting fusion efficiency. The Lys-binding molecular tweezer CLR01 delays the aggregation of PAP248-286 and SEM1(45-107) fibrillization, half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of CLR01 inhibition exhibited were 2.6 \u03bcM and 18.8 \u03bcM, respectively. By contrast, the IC50 to impede PAP85-120 assembly was significantly higher at 970 \u03bcM. Have the authors controlled for the possibility that CLR01 is functioning through colloid formation? It is important that the authors show that CLR01 is not impeding the adsorption of the aggregates to the EM grid, which can distort what is in solution. If these reactions are run for more than 30h, does aggregation into fibrils eventually occur? Does seeded aggregation eventually occur? The critical control that CLR01 is not displacing ThT from the fibrils needs to be performed. The analog in which all eight lysine and arginine residues are replaced by alanine appears to be far from a perfect control in that this variant is anticipated to be much more amyloidogenic? In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, the critical control that CLR01 is not displacing ThT from the fibrils and inhibiting fibril adsorption to the grids needs to be run-the rapidity of disassembly is surprising, is it really disassembly? The result that CLR01 destroys retroviral particles with IC50 values between 10-20 \u03bcM by compromising virion integrity further suggests that CLR01 might be functioning as a colloid. CLR01 decreased viral infectivity of semen in a concentration-dependent manner, while CLR03 had no impact on semen-mediated infection enhancement. At a CLR01 concentration of 31 \u03bcM, the enhancing effect of semen was completely abolished. Thus, CLR01 prevents HIV infection in the presence of semen. If this is occuring through monomeric CLR01 this is incredible, but I suspect the authors' inhibitor is a micelle or colloid. The data are so impressive that I am concerned that these results are unlikely due to the monomeric molecular tweezer, but my hypothesis could be incorrect."

In this report, the authors use a recently identified, general inhibitor of amyloid formation (the molecular tweezer CLR01) to understand whether it also inhibits model seminal amyloids: SEVI, PAP85-120 and SEM1. CLR01 is known to work by docking to exposed lysine and arginine residues and this molecule has found use as a probe for biophysical chemistry and protein folding studies. Lump et al. first test CLR01 as a possible inhibitor of seminal amyloids in vitro, using EM and a ThT assay. They then test whether the molecules can reverse pre-formed amyloids using similar methods. Next, they test whether CLR01 might block binding of mock virions to fibrils and find that the compound seems to disrupt virions themselves. They use AFM and microscopy in vesicles and virus particles to test this idea \u2013 concluding that CLR01 seems to disrupt virion membranes, similar to a detergent. Somehow, this membrane disruption effect seems to be exclusive to viral membranes, but the mechanism remains cloudy (and somewhat confusing). They find that CLR01 blocks the infectivity-enhancing activity of seminal fibrils, both with and without addition of BSA. Based on these results, the possibility of using CLR01 for the prevention of viral spread are discussed. However, there are concerns (and even contradictions) about the lack of mechanistic knowledge and the nature of the CLR01-amyloid interaction is not well understood. The null hypotheses \u2013 that CLR01 is a non-specific lysine interactor or even a detergent \u2013 are not adequately tested. Without deeper mechanistic insight and more rigorous exploration of the binding events, publication of the work seems premature."

Presumably, the mammalian membranes would be disrupted just like in the vesicle and virion studies, but not leading to toxicity. What is going on here? Is calcium flux activated? Do the cells change shape? What is the affinity of CLR01 for viral membranes, vesicles and mammalian membranes? What lipid is being bound? By what mechanism do the membranes dissolve? Normally, such questions could be addressed in subsequent work, but the readers of this document would be expected to have major concerns about the logical gas and contradictions in the datasets, making careful and unbiased discussion an important requirement."

The cavitand-like CLR01 acts by binding to lysine or arginine amino acids (the guests), with previously measured affinities in the 20 \u03bcM range, and presumably this activity is what leads to de-fibrilization (although exactly why binding should lead to defibrilization is unclear; presumably binding is improved in the soluble form, though this is not stated in the manuscript). In principle this is an interesting story, and certainly a novel use of a cavitand-like molecule, one that might inspire other efforts to repurpose such molecules, which are well-known to chemists, for similar effects. The manuscript could have substantial impact. Before it is published, I suggest the authors address the following concerns:"

Colloidal aggregation of organic small molecules can disrupt protein fibrils, by protein sequestration in the small molecule colloid (Feng et al., Nature Chem. Biol., 2008). Such a mechanism must be controlled for, especially given the peculiar efficacy of the compounds against the virion membranes themselves (this is hard to square with a host-guest type interaction, but would make sense for colloidal aggregates). To do so, the authors should do one or more of the following i. Look to see if CLR01 is forming colloids in the 10 - 30 \u03bcM range, for instance by dynamic light scattering. ii. Add a mild, non-ionic detergent such as Tween-100 to disrupt the colloidal aggregates. This would right-shift the efficacy curves (assuming the detergent doesn't disrupt the fibrils directly). iii. Before addition to the fibrils, spin down the aqueous \u201csolution\u201d of CRL01 (not the DMSO one) in a microfuge at its highest speed for 20 minutes. Use the supernatant as the CLR01 solution for efficacy testing (colloids will typically pellet over this time). iv. Add 10 mg/ml BSA to the fibril mixture, before addition of CLR01.

First, we have monitored early time points (0 min, 10 min and 20 min) in SEVI and PAP85-120 fibril remodeling by CLR01 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, B</a>). At these times, robust ThT fluorescence is still observed indicating that CLR01 is not simply displacing ThT from SEVI or PAP85-120 fibrils. Indeed, fibrils are still prevalent at these early times (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, CLR01 is not simply competing for ThT binding as we would expect an instantaneous effect on ThT fluorescence as is observed, for example, with another small molecule EGCG and ABeta40 fibrils (Palhano et al., 2013). In this regard, it is also important to note that ThT fluorescence of SEM1(45-107), SEVI(Ala), and PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils is unaffected by CLR01 at various times (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C, 3I, 3L</a>).

Buffer, CLR01 (250 \u00b5M), or a known competitor of ThT binding, BTA-1 (250 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lockhart et al., 2005</a>) were then added and incubated for 10min at room temperature. ThT displacement was then assessed by fluorescence. BTA-1 effectively displaced ThT, whereas CLR01 did not (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). These findings establish that CLR01 does not simply displace ThT from SEVI, PAP85-120, or SEM1(45-107) fibrils. Thus, any reduction in ThT fluorescence caused by CLR01 can be attributed to an inhibition of fibril assembly or remodeling of fibrils into conformers unable to bind ThT. Inhibition of fibril assembly by CLR01 has also been assessed by EM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A-C</a>). Likewise, fibril remodeling by CLR01 has also been assessed by: EM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-C</a>), Proteostat staining, a red fluorescent aggregate sensing dye (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-C</a>), seeding activity of remodeled conformers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), and circular dichroism (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D, E</a>).

Rather, the PAP248-286(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) results suggest that CLR01 is unable to inhibit fibrillization or remodel fibrils when the target polypeptide is devoid of lysine and arginine residues. The PAP248-286(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) peptides spontaneously assemble into amyloid more rapidly than the wild-type peptides (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, B, G, I</a>).

Hence, we have now added several experiments that provide deeper insight into the mechanism of CLR01 action. We can now exclude the possibility that CLR01 is acting via a non-specific mechanism mediated by colloidal CLR01 aggregates or detergent-like CLR01 micelles (see response to editor). We also demonstrate that the lysine-binding cavity of CLR01 plays an important role in both the anti-amyloid and antiviral activities of CLR01 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, it is important to note that the specificity of CLR01 binding to lysine or arginine is well established. CLR01 was tested against almost all naturally occurring amino acid residues in model compounds, and does not bind to any other amino acid side chain except for lysine (<i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>\u223c10 \u00b5M) and arginine (<i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>\u223c50 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fokkens et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kl\u00e4rner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kl\u00e4rner et al., 2010</a>). The structure of the CLR01-lysine complex and the precise mechanism of lysine threading into the CLR01 guest cavity and subsequent ion pairing have been extensively characterized by NMR spectroscopy, crystal structure, molecular dynamics, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bier et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dutt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kl\u00e4rner and Schrader, 2013</a>). Importantly, CLR01 has no effect on formation or remodeling of SEVI(Ala) or PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils in which all lysine and arginines residues are exchanged to alanines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G-I, 3I-L</a>). Thus, CLR01 does not inhibit amyloid formation or remodel amyloid fibrils in a non-specific way but rather requires that the polypeptides bear arginine or lysine residues. Moreover, the presence of arginine or lysine residues in the target peptide also does not guarantee that CLR01 will be able to remodel amyloid fibrils. Indeed, CLR01 could not remodel preformed SEM1(45-107) fibrils (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), indicating a specific effect of CLR01 on SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, B</a>). Importantly, we now also show that free lysine or poly-L-lysine abrogate the anti-amyloid activity of CLR01, further demonstrating specificity (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>).

Unfortunately, such anionic polymers have proven to be unsuccessful in past clinical trials due to their poor bioavailability and induction of inflammatory responses in the genital tract, which instead augment HIV transmission by recruiting HIV-susceptible target cells to the genital mucosa (<a href=\"#bib40\">L\u00fcscher-Mattli, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">van de Wijgert and Shattock, 2007</a>).

In addition, we have shown that some enzymes with lysine residues around the active site can be inhibited by CLR01, and start to work again, after addition of free lysine (<a href=\"#bib77\">Talbiersky et al., 2008</a>). As mentioned above, the interaction between CLR01 and lysine has been studied and it is structurally well characterized: threading of the lysine side chain through the tweezer cavity, plus ion pair formation between the lysine ammonium cation and the tweezer phosphate anion produces a <i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> of \u223c10 \u00b5M for the 1:1 complex between one lysine side chain and one tweezer molecule, as determined by NMR and fluorescence titration (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bier et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kl\u00e4rner and Schrader, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lopes et al., 2015</a>).

The interaction between a single lysine residue and CLR01 has a <i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> of \u223c10\u00b5M, with fast on and off rates. On proteins, however, only a few lysines are well accessible for the relatively large molecular skeleton of the tweezers. For example, ITC and MD+QM/MM calculations have revealed that only 5 of 17 surface lysines in a 14-3-3 protein are complexed by CLR01 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bier et al., 2013</a>). In addition, a key point is that, because of the high on\u2013off rate, CLR01 disrupts only relatively weak interactions as well as events that depend on critical and accessible lysine or arginine residues. Therefore, the tweezer has shown selectivity in multiple cases that on first impression may appear counter-intuitive. For example, inhibition of abnormal protein aggregation is achieved at 1:1\u20131:5 protein:CLR01 concentration (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acharya et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sinha et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>), whereas disruption of controlled protein polymerization, e.g., of tubulin, requires 55-fold excess CLR01 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Attar et al., 2014</a>) and enzyme inhibition requires \u223c1,000-fold excess CLR01 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Talbiersky et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, in vivo, CLR01 shows no toxicity at doses 2\u20133 orders of magnitude above those needed to enable clearance of amyloid (<a href=\"#bib4\">Attar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Attar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ferreira et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</a>).

For example, although the HIV membrane resembles lipid raft microdomains in that it is enriched for saturated lipids, phosphatidylserine, plasmalogen-phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol, and sphingolipids, it is unusually enriched for the unusual sphingolipid dihydrosphingomyelin (<a href=\"#bib8\">Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lorizate et al., 2009</a>).
