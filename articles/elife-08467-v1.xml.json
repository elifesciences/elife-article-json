Proteasome function is vulnerable to environmental insults, cellular protein imbalance and targeted pharmaceuticals. Yet, mechanisms that cells deploy to counteract inhibition of this central regulator are little understood. To find such mechanisms, we reduced flux through the proteasome to the point of toxicity with specific inhibitors and performed genome-wide screens for mutations that allowed cells to survive. Counter to expectation, reducing expression of individual subunits of the proteasome's 19S regulatory complex increased survival. Strong 19S reduction was cytotoxic but modest reduction protected cells from inhibitors. Protection was accompanied by an increased ratio of 20S to 26S proteasomes, preservation of protein degradation capacity and reduced proteotoxic stress. While compromise of 19S function can have a fitness cost under basal conditions, it provided a powerful survival advantage when proteasome function was impaired. This means of rebalancing proteostasis is conserved from yeast to humans."

Proteasome function is vulnerable to environmental insults, cellular protein imbalance and targeted pharmaceuticals. Yet, mechanisms that cells deploy to counteract inhibition of this central regulator are little understood. To find such mechanisms, we reduced flux through the proteasome to the point of toxicity with specific inhibitors and performed genome-wide screens for mutations that allowed cells to survive. Counter to expectation, reducing expression of individual subunits of the proteasome's 19S regulatory complex increased survival. Strong 19S reduction was cytotoxic but modest reduction protected cells from inhibitors. Protection was accompanied by an increased ratio of 20S to 26S proteasomes, preservation of protein degradation capacity and reduced proteotoxic stress. While compromise of 19S function can have a fitness cost under basal conditions, it provided a powerful survival advantage when proteasome function was impaired. This means of rebalancing proteostasis is conserved from yeast to humans."

Other mechanisms that may contribute include the induction of autophagy, the induction of alternative proteasome regulatory components, or the disruption of normal gating and drug\u2013target interaction affinities. These possibilities require further investigation. However, our general findings on the surprising ability of 19S subunit reductions to increase resistance to proteasome inhibitors are complementary to those of D Acosta-Alvear, P Walter, JS Weissman, and M Kampmann (Personal Communication) who arrived at this conclusion through very different approaches."

Indeed, a broad range of genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors can elicit such changes. In human stem cells, manipulation of just a single subunit of the 19S regulatory complex modified the 20S/26S proteasome ratio (<a href=\"#bib75\">Vilchez et al., 2012</a>). In cancer cells, many chromosomal regions are recurrently lost, and these often harbor genes that encode 19S subunits (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nijhawan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Davoli et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, mining data from a survey of 310 cancer cell lines, we find that those that have increased resistance to proteasome inhibitors have strongly reduced expression of at least one but often of several genes encoding 19S subunits."

Further, the ratio is shifted by post-translational modifications mediated by NAD<sup>+</sup> ADP-ribosyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib73\">Ullrich et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cho-Park and Steller, 2013</a>)."

In our hands, 19S subunit reduction was accompanied by accumulation of active 20S proteasome complexes. These complexes are highly effective in degrading oxidized (<a href=\"#bib59\">Reinheckel et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Grune et al., 2003</a>) and intrinsically disordered proteins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Baugh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tsvetkov et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Wiggins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014</a>) in an ubiquitin-independent manner.

First, these complexes mediate the endoproteolytic cleavage of translation initiating factors eIF4G1, eIF4F, and eIF3a (<a href=\"#bib8\">Baugh and Pilipenko, 2004</a>), which could directly contribute to the inhibition of protein synthesis that occurs following 19S subunit reduction. Second, 20S proteasomes preferentially degrade newly synthesized substrates (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tsvetkov et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Adler et al., 2010</a>). In addition, 20S proteasome complexes degrade numerous intrinsically disordered proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, cell cycle control, and oncogenesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Asher et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Jariel-Encontre et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014</a>). The degradation of such 20S substrates could underlie the robust anti-proliferation response that follows bortezomib treatment of cells with reduced 19S subunits. Such a shift into a quiescent-like state likely triggers adaptive cytoprotection. This is reminiscent of yeast that transition into stationary phase when nutrients are exhausted. In this setting, there is also a reversible reduction in protein translation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fuge et al., 1994</a>) and levels of 26S proteasomes sharply decrease in favor of active 20S proteasomes, which are essential for viability during prolonged periods of nutrient depravation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bajorek et al., 2003</a>). Thus, the protective mechanism that is generated upon 20S formation is likely conserved from yeast to human and may be part of the natural transitions used to established stress-resistant quiescent states."

However, in nature, mechanisms for rebalancing the 20S/26S proteasome ratio most likely emerged to help cells contend with perturbations that cause protein misfolding.

Such mechanisms may have also helped organisms withstand naturally occurring 20S proteasome inhibitors that are elaborated by microorganisms cohabiting their niches (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schneekloth and Crews, 2011</a>). Such selective pressures could have shaped the evolution of this ancient survival mechanism, one that emerged long before the advent of the use of proteasome inhibitors as anti-cancer therapeutics. In agreement with our results indicating that yeast cells are protected from proteasome inhibitors by reducing 19S subunits, Breslow et al. found that reducing 19S subunits can rescue yeast strains that are growth inhibited by reductions in 20S subunits (<a href=\"#bib12\">Breslow et al., 2008</a>)."

This raises the intriguing possibility that large populations of cells might harbor functional heterogeneity for surviving altered flux through the proteasome. At one extreme, some cells might be highly proliferative yet highly sensitive to proteasome inhibition, while at the other extreme, some cells could be slowly proliferative yet highly resistant to proteasome inhibition. Because of their slower proliferation capacity, the latter would have generally reduced relative fitness, analogous to the small populations of drug-tolerant \u2018persister\u2019 cells that reside within tumor populations (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sharma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Glickman and Sawyers, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Knoechel et al., 2014</a>).

Survival was increased by reduced expression of subunits comprising the 19S regulatory subunit of the proteasome, thereby increasing the ratio of 20S to 26S proteasomes. While this cellular alteration has fitness costs in the absence of stress (stable cell lines could not be isolated under basal conditions), this means of counteracting reduced flux through the proteasome under stressful conditions is conserved from yeast to humans. All insertions that reached a high level of statistical enrichment occur in genes encoding subunits of the proteasome 19S regulatory complex. These included both subunits that hydrolyze ATP (<i>PSMC2</i>, <i>PSMC3</i>, <i>PSMC4</i>, <i>PSMC5</i>, and <i>PSMC6</i>) subunits that are not ATPases (<i>PSMD2</i>, <i>PSMD6</i>, <i>PSMD7</i>, and <i>PSMD12</i>). No insertions were recovered in genes encoding subunits of the 20S catalytic component of the proteasome. The Bortezomib screen uncovered less loss-of-function hits, consistent with its superior selectivity relative to MG-132 that hits many targets in addition to the 20S proteasome. ShRNA targeting of the PSMD2 subunit of the 19S regulatory subunit rendered cells much more resistant to Bortezomib without activating the heat shock response or the NRF2 transcription factor-this treatment did not ameliorate ER stress or Hsp90 inhibition or non-proteasome flux stresses. In cells with reduced levels of PSMD2, bortezomib treatment strongly repressed genes involved in DNA replication. This heightened anti-proliferation response suggests that cells with reduced 19S subunits are primed to enter a protected, quiescent-like state when flux through the proteasome is reduced. Moreover, reducing PSMD2 levels maintained proteasome degradation flux upon bortezomib treatment and maintained the normal rate of protein synthesis. These phenotypes in mammalian cells are preserved in yeast, identifying a mechanism preserved over a billion years of evolution. In cancer cell lines, proteasome resistance is often coupled to reduction in the expression of one or more genes encoding the 19S subunits of the proteasome, speaking to significance.

The analysis had been done at 24 hours after the addition of bortezomib, a time point when cells retained full viability (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The text and the figure legend now make this point more explicitly. In addition, as the reviewer suggested, we performed a time course, monitoring 20S proteasome complexes (native gel) and total subunit levels (SDS Page gel) at 3, 6 and 18 hours after exposure to bortezomib (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1G and H</a>).

It may simply be that cells with 19S knockdown start with such high levels of 20S complex that a significant fraction remains active at the concentrations of bortezomib that we used. To further investigate the increase in 20S complex levels and activity, we fractionated cell lysates using glycerol gradients with and without 19S subunit reduction and with and without bortezomib treatment (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The analysis of gradient fractions for proteasome subunit content and activity support our observations from native gel analysis and from the protein degradation assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and 4D</a>).
