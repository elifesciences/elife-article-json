Microbial transmission in food-processing facilities has an enormous impact on the qualities and healthfulness of foods, beneficially or detrimentally interacting with food products. To explore modes of microbial transmission and spoilage-gene frequency in a commercial food-production scenario, we profiled hop-resistance gene frequencies and bacterial and fungal communities in a brewery. We employed a Bayesian approach for predicting routes of contamination, revealing critical control points for microbial management. Physically mapping microbial populations over time illustrates patterns of dispersal and identifies potential contaminant reservoirs within this environment. Habitual exposure to beer is associated with increased abundance of spoilage genes, predicting greater contamination risk. Elucidating the genetic landscapes of indoor environments poses important practical implications for food-production systems and these concepts are translatable to other built environments."

Microbial transmission in food-processing facilities has an enormous impact on the qualities and healthfulness of foods, beneficially or detrimentally interacting with food products. To explore modes of microbial transmission and spoilage-gene frequency in a commercial food-production scenario, we profiled hop-resistance gene frequencies and bacterial and fungal communities in a brewery. We employed a Bayesian approach for predicting routes of contamination, revealing critical control points for microbial management. Physically mapping microbial populations over time illustrates patterns of dispersal and identifies potential contaminant reservoirs within this environment. Habitual exposure to beer is associated with increased abundance of spoilage genes, predicting greater contamination risk. Elucidating the genetic landscapes of indoor environments poses important practical implications for food-production systems and these concepts are translatable to other built environments."

Like other indoor environments, the building materials, substrates, and physiochemical conditions encountered by microbes in food-processing facilities differ dramatically from the outdoor conditions to which microbial life evolved (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kelley and Gilbert, 2013</a>). How this has impacted the adaptation and ecological assemblages of microbes in food systems is largely unexplored. While the microbial communities of other indoor environments, such as homes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lax et al., 2014</a>), office buildings (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kembel et al., 2014</a>), and hospitals (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bokulich et al., 2013a</a>), can influence the health of their inhabitants, food-production facilities represent a unique type of built environment wherein microbial activities are intimately tied to product-quality outcomes. Thus, the sensory and safety effects of microbial growth in food-production streams have a much broader impact, such that consumer enjoyment and health can be linked to the hygiene and processing decisions at the food facility. Furthermore, both beneficial and detrimental microbial activities are well defined in foods, making these systems a useful model for exploring microbial ecosystem dynamics beyond the scope of contaminant mitigation."

Most modern food-fermentation practices occur under relatively aseptic conditions, employing pure starter cultures in their production, and environmental contamination represents a prevalent threat to product integrity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</a>). Beer is typically produced through fermentation of malted barley sugars (wort) to alcohol by pure strains of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> or <i>Saccharomyces pastorianus</i>, and any additional organisms\u2014including cross-contamination from different <i>Saccharomyces</i> strains used in the same facility\u2014are considered contaminants (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</a>). In traditional fermentation production practices, conversely, microbial communities introduced from raw materials and processing environments are central to the fermentation process. For example, in the production of coolship (lambic-style) beers, a type of sour beer, no starter cultures are added to the wort; instead, boiled wort is allowed to cool overnight in a shallow, open-top vessel known as a coolship where indigenous microbiota are presumably introduced to the product, initiating fermentation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Van Oevelen et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bokulich et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Spitaels et al., 2014</a>).

Beer is protected from wholesale microbial contamination through its alcoholic, low-pH, and antimicrobial properties, and modern sanitary technologies and practices minimize the threat of spoilage organisms that have evolved specifically to grow in beer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</a>). Nevertheless, biofilms and other environmental reservoirs remain potential sources of microbial contamination in breweries (<a href=\"#bib57\">Timke et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Storgards et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Timke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mamvura et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Matoulkova et al., 2012</a>). As wort is boiled prior to fermentation, the primary reservoir for spoilage microorganisms in beer production is the brewery environment. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are of particular concern, as some members of this clade resist hop antimicrobial compounds, enabling growth and spoilage of beer through acidification, hazes, and off-flavors (<a href=\"#bib56\">Suzuki et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</a>). Hop iso-alpha-acids, the primary antimicrobial compounds in beer, kill most Gram-positive bacteria by acting as ionophores, dissipating proton-motive force across cell walls (<a href=\"#bib46\">Simpson and Fernandez, 1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Simpson, 1993a</a>), and via oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib6\">Behr and Vogel, 2010</a>). Very few resistance mechanisms have been proposed (<a href=\"#bib56\">Suzuki et al., 2006</a>), primarily being the multi-drug transporters <i>horA</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sami et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sakamoto et al., 2001</a>) and <i>horC</i> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Iijima et al., 2006</a>), the transcriptional regulator of <i>horC, horB</i> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Iijima et al., 2006</a>), and <i>hitA</i>, a divalent cation transporter (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hayashi et al., 2001</a>) that imports manganese into the cell. These genes are all located on plasmids and transmit via horizontal gene transfer (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2006</a>).

Given the inherent role of environmental microbiota in conducting coolship ale fermentations, this serves as a model system for studying mechanisms for microbial transfer within food-processing systems. Information on population and gene flow extends to other food-processing systems where environmental microbiota are involved positively or negatively in the production, stability, and safety of human nutrition."

Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity of complete microbial profiles reveals that many samples cluster by processing room and substrate type regardless of season (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2\u20133</a>).

Barrels cluster, associated with <i>Aspergillus, Eurotium</i>, and <i>Penicillium</i>; coolship and barrel-room samples with <i>Cryptococcus</i> and <i>Cladosporium</i>.

Same as conventional, but following boiling wort is pumped to the coolship room where it is left to cool overnight, exposed to the atmosphere. The following morning, the wort is pumped to barrels in which it is fermented and aged for 1\u20133 years. In the Autumn samples, this occurred in the barrel room in the main brewery, but in Spring and Summer this moved to a newly built facility dedicated to sour beers. All coolship and sour beers were packaged on separate equipment in this second facility. The distinction between coolship beers and sour beers is the use of this coolship; other sour beers are produced using conventional brewing methods (panel <b>B</b>), but are fermented with organisms other than Saccharomyces yeasts."

This tool predicts the relative proportion of contamination in sink samples (in this case brewery surfaces) from microbial sources (raw ingredients and extraneous sources). Raw substrates (grain, hops, yeast, beer) and extraneous sources (human skin, outdoor air, soil, saliva, feces, freshwater, ocean water) from previous studies (<a href=\"#bib23\">Caporaso et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Bowers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Caporaso et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Bowers et al., 2013</a>) were tested as microbial sources. Results reveal distinct patterns of contamination across seasons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Grains were predicted as the largest microbial contributor to hotside areas, almost all surfaces in the coolship room, and areas of the cellar away from the main fermentation area. Hops were predicted as the major contributor to cellar fermentation areas and fermentation equipment. Yeast was predicted as the highest contributor to fermenters, conditioning tanks, and packaging equipment. Beer was predicted to be a common contaminant around fermenters and barrels within the cellar. Skin was a minor contributor to some surfaces in the cellar. Other surfaces, including most barrels and barrel-room surfaces, were most influenced by unknown sources. Outdoor air, soil, saliva, feces, freshwater, and ocean water were predicted to provide only a very low level of contamination (&lt;0.001 relative abundance). These results suggest that raw substrates are the main contaminant sources within the brewery, compared to extraneous sources. However, it is important to note that these predictions do not indicate a causative role for contamination. These predicted source/sink relationships could alternatively suggest that both are actually contaminated by another, untested source (e.g, fruit flies or other vectors could transfer microbes between these and other surfaces within the brewery). Nevertheless, these predictions highlight potential sources of contamination, or at least shared microbial transmission patterns, between substrates and equipment/surfaces within the brewery."

Consequently, raw materials (grain, hops, yeast) may be important vectors for any spoilage organisms encountered in the facility. This substrate-centric community structuring has also been observed in other food facilities (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bokulich and Mills, 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bokulich et al., 2013b</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2014</a>). However, the brewery surface niches clustered throughout time with only subtle changes across seasons, unlike wineries, which were significantly impacted by seasonal factors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Bokulich et al., 2013b</a>). This reflects the divergent production schemes of these two foods: whereas most beers are produced year-round, wine is an inherently seasonal product. The raw materials for beer are stored and processed throughout the year in a continual production schedule, creating a stable environment on equipment surfaces that interact with these same raw substrates on a daily basis. Instead, brewery environments may function more like cheese-making environments, where facility-specific \u2018house\u2019 microbial communities form on equipment surfaces in response to idiosyncrasies in the indoor environment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bokulich and Mills, 2013a</a>). Such a possibility would have interesting implications for sour beer breweries, and comparative studies of lambic and coolship breweries could offer insight into the brewery-specific flavor profiles displayed in these beers."

Several populations visibly spread with time, most prominently <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, which progressed from dominating fermentation and packaging areas only in Autumn to being the most abundant fungus detected across the brewery in Spring and Summer. Likewise, <i>C. santamariae</i> displayed high abundance on hotside surfaces in Autumn but became more abundant and spread to nearby sections of the cellar in Spring and Summer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). As building measurements were not taken during these times, the factors driving these changes cannot be assessed with these data, but warming temperatures and increasing humidity in the Spring and Summer months could be associated phenomena. Other taxa demonstrated more localized patterns of dispersion, such as <i>Micrococcus</i> and <i>Kocuria</i>, which appeared to spread the most around floors and other surfaces in cellar, barrel room, and packaging areas (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Here, regular contact with beer runoff diluted with rinse water may support growth of these populations, which are associated with spoilage in low-alcohol beers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Back, 1981</a>). High populations of <i>Acetobacter</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> were found more disparately, and specifically in areas where high volumes of wort and beer may be encountered: on conveyor belts and floors below packaging areas, hotside and cellar area sinks, and on sample ports for isolated fermenters and kegs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). On these sites microbial communities can contact undiluted beer, for example, drips in the basin below the packaging-line belt, wort and beer collected for specific gravity (sugar concentration) measurements then dumped in sinks, and sampling ports on fermenters. This follows the known behavior of these bacteria, which can spoil undiluted, higher-alcohol beers under appropriate conditions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</a>)."

Microbes not only associate with specific substrates, they exhibit patterns of dispersion within confined regions of the brewery. This yields useful insight into the transmission behavior of these organisms, and especially taxa associated with beer spoilage, through physical space. Microbial confinement within discrete zones suggests that physical barriers (e.g., walls) and physiochemical conditions (e.g., humidity and temperature control) can staunch the spread of some microbes. Non-production surfaces that encounter beer and/or waste streams, such as floors, sinks, and grain-handling equipment, are typically only cleaned by hose and may accumulate substrates for supporting microbial growth and survival. Aerosols and splashing occur regularly in a production brewery (indeed, hosing down floors is one obvious cause), increasing the likelihood for microbial spread and colonization from these surfaces onto other surfaces, including equipment. Human and insect traffic can also increase the rate of dispersal between these surfaces (e.g., from one room to another). Physical partitions appear to inhibit this passage as observed in this brewery and, where possible, may reduce the probability for contamination. This is particularly important in packaging areas, where microbial dispersal can directly contaminate sanitary surfaces and open packages, increasing the likelihood of spoilage in finished product. Separating packaging rooms from cellar and hotside operations and using local partitions, such as blast shields, may help protect packaging surfaces and beer from such routes of contamination. Further investigations into the relationship between building materials, spatial area, indoor conditions (e.g., airflow, humidity, and personnel traffic), and the rate and extent of microbial dispersion could yield important findings for optimal brewery design from the perspective of microbial control. These findings are instructive but indeed should not be interpreted with alarm: they illustrate microbial dispersal in a functioning brewery that rarely suffers from any cases of product contamination."

As the primary reservoir for spoilage microbes in beer production, tracking spoilage genes on brewing surfaces and materials is important for understanding contamination risks arising from the environment. Sour beer contained the highest gene abundance, which is predictable given that the LAB growing in these (coolship) beers must be adapted to resist hop antimicrobials. Likewise, detection on barrel surfaces is also expected, given their regular and direct contact with these sour beers. Fermenters and packaging-line surfaces also exhibited fairly high levels of hop-resistance genes, with the highest detection on surfaces that contact sour beers and unsanitary surfaces (below packaging belt, packaging-line sink). The only sanitary, conventional beer-making surface among these is the second filler head, which only exhibited 4 cumulative copies/cm<sup>2</sup> of the resistance genes, compared to 2.1 \u00d7 10<sup>2</sup> in the first filler head, which is used for packaging sour and barrel-aged beers. Nevertheless, this second filler head is also a sanitary surface ready for packaging, and should be free of contaminants. DNA was used for ddPCR and thus these counts may represent dead cells present on the equipment surfaces; the relative proportion of viable cells is unknown. If the resistance genes detected by ddPCR do in fact represent any viable cells, this demonstrates the resilience of these bacterial populations on equipment surfaces that regularly contact \u2018contaminated\u2019 (in this case, intentionally contaminated) beers. These findings argue for careful separation of equipment used in conventional beer-making from that used for sour beers: equipment that contacts fermenting and finished sour beer or barrels, including pumps, hoses, and especially packaging equipment, is best dedicated to sour beer production and should not be used to handle conventional beers."

Undissociated humulones are significantly less inhibitory to LAB, and the antimicrobial effects of hops are dependent upon acidic conditions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Simpson and Smith, 1992</a>). Thus, the selective pressure to acquire and maintain hop-resistance genes only exists in the presence of hopped beer, not in raw hops. Only two hop pellets were tested for hop-resistance genes, but this finding suggests that the brewery environment itself is the site of hop-resistance-gene propagation.

This approach will facilitate understanding how spoilage resistance propagates within production environments and the reservoirs and vectors encouraging its spread, yielding novel insight for controlling spoilage\u2014focused on gene transmission rather than taxonomic populations. Moving forward, this facility-surveillance model opens many questions and possibilities for mapping microbial spoilage dynamics within food-production systems. What relationship do indoor environmental factors, building design, and surface materials have with microbial transmission? What roles do cleaning and other processes play in controlling contamination on a facility-wide scale? What other biomarkers are associated with contamination and how does the spoilage-allele landscape behave over time and in response to these conditions? The potential advantages of studying microbiology of breweries are not confined to food systems alone, and lessons learned here may aid our understanding of microbial communities in other built environments. For example, the hop-resistance genes include ABC multi-drug transporters similar to other antimicrobial-resistance genes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sakamoto et al., 2001</a>). Studying and manipulating their transmission within breweries may aid understanding of similar gene-transfer events involved in pathogenesis in hospitals, homes, water systems, or public environments where in situ modeling of such genes is unfeasible or a potential health hazard. Breweries are a useful model for testing general theories of microbial transmission and spoilage-gene dispersal in situ for functional indoor environments and food systems, as beer spoilage is not actually detrimental to human health\u2014merely human pleasure."

Sequences failing alignment or identified as chimera were removed prior to downstream analysis. OTU tables were evenly subsampled to 400 sequences per sample for all statistical tests. MANOVA with 999 permutations was used to test significant difference between sample categories based on Bray\u2013Curtis distance using Adonis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anderson, 2001</a>).

All probes contained a 3\u2032 IowaBlack FQ quencher paired with different 5\u2032 fluorescent labels (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Each 20 \u03bcl reaction was then pipetted into separate wells of a disposable eight channel droplet generation cartridge (Bio-Rad) and 70 \u00b5l of droplet generation oil (Bio-Rad) loaded into the cartridge oil wells. The cartridge was then inserted into the QX100 droplet generator (Bio-Rad) and each sample was portioned into droplet-sized water-in-oil emulsions. Following droplet generation, emulsion samples were transferred to a 96-well PCR plate (Eppendorf). The plate was then hot-sealed with foil cover and subjected to conventional PCR in the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR (Bio-Rad). Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an activation period for 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of a denaturation step for 30 s at 94\u00b0C, and an annealing-extension step for 60 s at the optimal annealing temperature (59\u201359.6\u00b0C), using a ramp rate of 2.5\u00b0C/s for each step and a final inactivation step of 98\u00b0C for 10 min. After PCR amplification, the plate was loaded into the QX100 Droplet Digitial PCR (Bio-Rad) and analyzed for absolute signal quantification of each fluorescence channel in each well.

Given that the results are a prediction of possible contamination, it will be helpful to know what the confidence in these predictions is. In addition, how do the authors distinguish between alternate possibilities such as 1) microbes coming instead from untested sources, 2) source and sample just happening to have similar communities, or 3) both source and sample being \u201ccontaminated\u201d by another untested source. In other words, how likely is it that the listed source is actually causative of the \u201ccontamination\u201d? This seems particularly difficult to determine in the coolship analysis. One dominant source is the beer-packaging surface (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Isn't it equally likely that the beer itself was the source of contamination of the packaging surface? Also, is the barrel \u201csource\u201d the fermenting beer inside the barrel, the interior surface of an empty barrel (have the barrels been used for brewing before or are they new?), or the exterior of the barrel? Again, how can the \u201csource\u201d here really be interpreted? Some additional clarification would be very helpful. In short, the authors should elaborate on what other likely sources there are, and test these as possible sources, which might provide more information for the sites \u201cinfluenced by unknown sources\u201d (third paragraph of the Results and Discussion section). Such sources could include human skin and saliva, as well as rinse water, soil and outdoor air, and could easily be included analysis. Given that the authors used the 515F/806R primers for bacterial sequencing, it should be straight-forward to include samples from other studies for comparisons."

The sourcetracker analysis has been re-done incorporating other source samples from published studies, as suggested. These include human skin, outdoor air, human saliva, feces, soil, freshwater, and ocean water from a number of other studies. We have also included beer samples as possible sources. This analysis revealed that human skin and beer were sources of contamination on some surfaces, but other additional sources were negligible (&lt; 0.1% relative contribution). Otherwise, results for other contaminant sources are similar to the original analysis. These results are shown in a new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."
