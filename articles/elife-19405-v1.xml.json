This structure involves a thin finger-like protrusion from one cell\u2019s membrane inserting itself into a pocket (or invagination) formed in the membrane of the cell in front (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

This organelle serves as an organizing center for protein filaments called microtubules. As such, the centrosome has an integral role in the assembly of the mitotic spindle: the macromolecular machine (composed of microtubules) that segregates the chromosomes during cell division."

This conclusion is based upon three lines of evidence. First, the centrosome is closely connected to the tip of the invagination via microtubules. Second, cutting this tip with a laser caused the invagination to quickly retract, demonstrating that it was under mechanical tension. Third, Negishi et al. show that mutant sea squirts\u00a0that fail to orient their spindles correctly tended to form the membrane invaginations in the wrong direction as well. These mutants included those with defects in a developmental phenomenon known as \u201cplanar cell polarity\u201d (often shortened to PCP), which instructs how animal cells in specific tissues become oriented in the same direction. These findings indicate that\u00a0the direction in which the invagination forms is under the control of the same signaling pathway that controls planar cell polarity."

For example, how does the membrane know the position of the centrosome in order to project towards it? Although the microtubules that emanate from the centrosome might provide the cue, this mechanism does not explain how the membrane invagination is carved into a thin finger-like tube. Also, is the composition of the invagination different to that of the rest of the cell surface? And if the answer to this question is yes, is there\u00a0a barrier that keeps the two membranes distinct (as is the case for the primary cilia; <a href=\"#bib3\">Hu et al., 2010</a>)?"

This remains unclear because, by the time the spindle forms and a cell begins to divide, the invagination (like the primary cilium) has been retracted or otherwise removed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Perhaps, the invagination pulls the centrosome when it retracts as the process of cell division begins."

Specifically, the invagination attaches to one of the two centrioles that make up the centrosome \u2013 the same centriole that also grows a primary cilium.
