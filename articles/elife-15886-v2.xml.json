Using quantitative thermodynamic, kinetic and structural methods, we show that synaptotagmin-1 (from <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>) binds to PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> via a polybasic lysine patch in the C2B domain, which may promote the priming or docking of synaptic vesicles. Ca<sup>2+</sup> neutralizes the negative charges of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, resulting in the penetration of synaptotagmin-1 into the membrane, via binding of PtdSer, and an increase in the affinity of the polybasic lysine patch to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>). These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced events decrease the dissociation rate of synaptotagmin-1 membrane binding while the association rate remains unchanged. We conclude that both membrane penetration and the increased residence time of synaptotagmin-1 at the plasma membrane are crucial for triggering exocytotic membrane fusion."

Using quantitative thermodynamic, kinetic and structural methods, we show that synaptotagmin-1 (from <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>) binds to PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> via a polybasic lysine patch in the C2B domain, which may promote the priming or docking of synaptic vesicles. Ca<sup>2+</sup> neutralizes the negative charges of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, resulting in the penetration of synaptotagmin-1 into the membrane, via binding of PtdSer, and an increase in the affinity of the polybasic lysine patch to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>). These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced events decrease the dissociation rate of synaptotagmin-1 membrane binding while the association rate remains unchanged. We conclude that both membrane penetration and the increased residence time of synaptotagmin-1 at the plasma membrane are crucial for triggering exocytotic membrane fusion."

When a neuron is activated, the levels of calcium ions inside the cell rise. This causes molecules called neurotransmitters to be released from the neuron at a synapse to make contact with the second neuron.

Synaptotagmin-1 has two regions that can bind to calcium ions, known as the C2 domains. When calcium ion levels rise, these domains insert into the cell membrane by binding to two fat molecules in the membrane called phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP<sub>2</sub>).

Before triggering, neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles. Upon arrival of an action potential, voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels open, leading to a rise in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. The primary Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for synchronous neuronal exocytosis is synaptotagmin-1 (syt-1), a resident protein of synaptic vesicles that consists of a short luminal domain, a transmembrane \u03b1-helix and two cytoplasmic C2 domains, referred to as C2A and C2B. C2 domains were first identified in protein kinase C (PKC), and have since been detected in many diverse proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Corbalan-Garcia and Gomez-Fernandez, 2014</a>). The C2 domains of syt-1 are composed of structurally conserved eight-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sandwiches of ~130 residues. These domains contain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops at one end of the \u03b2-sandwich motif. Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, the electrostatic surface potential of the C2 domains is altered. As a\u00a0result, Coulombic attraction develops towards the head groups of anionic phospholipids, leading to binding of the C2 domains to the membrane associated with completion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination sphere. Moreover, a conserved polybasic lysine patch located on the\u00a0C2B domain also binds to anionic lipid in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, being particularly attracted to multivalent phosphoinositides (PtdIns) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">S\u00fcdhof,\u00a02013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chapman,\u00a02008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brose et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Corbalan-Garcia and G\u00f3mez-Fern\u00e1ndez,\u00a02014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">S\u00fcdhof,\u00a02012</a>)."

However, the mechanism of syt-1 binding to the membrane remains a matter of controversy. For example, recent studies have reported that a double Lys-to-Ala mutation in the polybasic lysine patch (termed the KAKA mutant) does not alter the binding of the syt-1 C2AB fragment to vesicles containing phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and/or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2009</a>).

We also used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the affinities of the C2AB fragment towards the head groups of PtdSer and PtdIns. Moreover, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments to determine the residues that are affected by binding to PtdSer and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments to examine the orientation of the C2AB fragment with respect to the membrane surface. Our results demonstrate that PtdSer and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> act in a\u00a0synergistic manner to enhance the penetration depth of syt-1 and to reduce the dissociation rate from the membrane. Furthermore, our data provide strong evidence that PtdIns binds to the polybasic lysine patch on the C2B domain and does not compete with PtdSer for sites in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops. Importantly, enhanced binding to the membrane in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is exclusively due to a decrease in the dissociation rate (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>), whereas the association rate (<i>k</i><sub>on</sub>) remains unchanged. Although synergistic, the binding of the\u00a0syt-1 C2AB fragment is dramatically different for PtdSer- and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes, suggesting that the modes of binding to these two lipids are distinct in nature."

To determine whether the orientation of the C2AB fragment differs when bound to membranes containing either PtdSer or PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we performed EPR experiments using spin-labeled variants of the protein. Insertion of the spin-labeled side chain R1 (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) into the hydrophobic core of the membrane alters the rotamer sampling and motion of the spin label. As consequence, the EPR spectra from membrane-embedded spin labels are significantly broadened when\u00a0the\u00a0C2AB fragment is fully bound to vesicles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). In\u00a0addition, using progressive power saturation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Freed et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Frazier et al., 2003</a>), we determined the membrane insertion depth of labels attached to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the\u00a0C2A domain (residues 173 and 234), the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the\u00a0C2B domain (residues 304 and 368) and the polybasic lysine patch (residue 329). When bound to bilayers containing 5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, labels in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops exhibit more motional averaging than they\u00a0do\u00a0when bound to vesicles composed of either 20% PtdSer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) or 10% PtdSer\u00a0+\u00a02.5% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2\u00a0</sub>(data not shown).

As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib31\">Herrick et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kuo et al., 2009</a>), R1 sidechains\u00a0at sites 173, 234, 368 and 304 penetrate the membrane in the presence of PtdSer regardless of whether PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is present, but failed to deeply penetrate the membrane in vesicles containing only PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, the insertion depth of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops was 4\u20136 \u00c5ngstroms (\u00c5) shallower in membranes composed of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> than in membranes containing PtdSer. By contrast, a label in the polybasic patch, 329R1, was closer to the membrane in PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing vesicles than in PtdSer-containing vesicles, indicating that there is a difference in orientation. Using the power saturation data in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, the orientations of C2B domain in the presence of membranes containing either\u00a0PtdSer or PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> were determined (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) and are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>.The presence of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is found to promote a tilt of the C2B domain, which is consistent with its interaction with the polybasic face. It should be kept in mind that the depth measurements are averaged values and that these models represent an average of what must be a dynamic system. Together with the stopped-flow measurements described above, these data indicate that PtdSer and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> play a synergistic role in the binding of syt-1 to the membrane. When both PtdSer and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> are present, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of syt-1 penetrate deeper into the bilayer than they do when the membrane contains PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> alone, leading to a tighter binding of the\u00a0C2AB fragment to the membrane, which is reflected by a decrease in the dissociation rate."

Our rationale was that by using the head group of the phospholipid, we could determine the role of each specific phospholipid in the binding of the C2AB fragment to the membrane, avoiding the\u00a0interferences of other phospholipids and unspecific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the protein and the membrane. In our experiments, only small changes in the binding enthalpy were observed upon injection of O-PSer into a solution containing the C2AB fragment, precluding a quantitative assessment of the thermodynamics of binding. This did not change even when we used a short-chain analogue of PtdSer (1,2-hexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine, C<sub>6</sub>-PtdSer) instead of O-PSer. By contrast, binding of InsP<sub>3</sub> to the C2AB fragment was highly exothermic, showing a stoichiometry of 1:1 and an affinity of 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>)."

By contrast, the\u00a0addition of InsP<sub>3</sub> induced chemical shift changes primarily in the polybasic lysine patch of the C2B domain, with the highest chemical shifts observable for residues K325, K326 and K327, confirming previous reports which established the polybasic lysine patch of the C2B domain as the\u00a0primary binding site of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vrljic et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">van den Bogaart et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,c</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>).

The experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a>), with the\u00a0wild-type C2AB fragment as control. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the binding affinity of the wild-type protein was significantly lower than in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This reduction is\u00a0mediated\u00a0by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site of the C2B domain: it was abolished in the C2Ab and C2ab mutants\u00a0but not in the C2aB mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). Apparently, the negatively charged side chains in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site reduce the affinity of the negatively charged InsP<sub>3</sub> through unfavorable Coulombic interactions. Neutralizing these charges by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding or, alternatively, by their deletion by mutagenesis are equally effective in preventing the thermodynamic penalty resulting from repulsive interactions. In line with that proposition, the lower affinities were mainly due to a decrease in binding enthalpy rather than to\u00a0reduced\u00a0entropy (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), as one would expect for a primarily electrostatic effect. Nevertheless, no change of the binding stoichiometry was observed in any of the different conditions and mutants tested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). Next, we repeated the ITC titrations using the isolated C2A and C2B domains of syt-1. As expected, the C2B domain bound InsP<sub>3</sub> in a manner similar to the C2AB fragment. By contrast, binding of InsP<sub>3</sub> to the C2A domain yielded only small enthalpy changes, confirming that C2B is indeed the domain responsible for InsP<sub>3</sub> binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>)."

To test this hypothesis, we measured InsP<sub>3</sub> binding to the isolated C2B domain in the presence of SNARE complex and in the\u00a0absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (to avoid precipitation of protein [<a href=\"#bib17\">Dai et al., 2007</a>]) by ITC. The presence or absence of SNARE-complex made no difference to InsP<sub>3</sub> binding to the isolated C2B domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>), in agreement with previous observations from our group (<a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 2015</a>) .\u00a0This\u00a0evidence\u00a0suggests that, under physiological conditions, the\u00a0C2AB fragment binds preferentially to PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. A recent study has reported three distinct syt\u2013SNARE interfaces involving both C2A and C2B domains (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, we next repeated the experiment described above using the C2AB fragment and lower protein concentration,\u00a0~15 \u00b5M instead of\u00a0~50 \u00b5M, to reduce the chances of protein aggregation. Interestingly, the presence of the SNARE complex resulted in a moderate decrease in affinity of InsP<sub>3</sub> to the C2AB fragment, in contrast to above results using the\u00a0C2B domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g,i</a>). To clarify this discrepancy, we decided to examine the syt\u2013SNARE interaction using ITC. Our results show that the SNARE complex binds the\u00a0C2AB fragment with higher affinity than it does the C2B domain, and that K326 and K327 play an important role in this binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h,i</a>), in agreement with recent findings (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2016</a>)."

Using ITC, we studied the binding of InsP<sub>3</sub> to the KAKA mutant in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, binding to InsP<sub>3</sub> was abolished (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib60\">van den Bogaart et al., 2012</a>). However, in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the KAKA mutant was able to bind to InsP<sub>3</sub>, but with lower affinity than the\u00a0wild-type C2AB fragment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,d</a>). To further investigate the binding of the KAKA mutant to the membrane in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we performed stopped-flow experiments in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. No binding was detectable using FRET, probably because\u00a0of\u00a0the low concentration of protein used in our pseudo-first-order conditions, which did not provide enough signal for detection (data not shown). To overcome this limitation, we carried out a vesicle sedimentation assay to measure the fraction of protein bound\u00a0to sucrose-loaded vesicles under true equilibrium conditions. Using sedimentation, the KAKA mutant was found to bind with reduced affinity to either PtdSer- or PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing bilayers in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a,b,c</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Remarkably, the KAKA mutation produced only a small effect on the binding to PtdSer-containing bilayers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>), but dramatically reduced the membrane affinity of C2AB fragment to 2% PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> bilayers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). In these membranes, the KAKA mutant altered the membrane-binding free energy of C2AB fragment by 7.5 kJ/mole. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the KAKA mutant failed to bind to PtdSer- or PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing bilayers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d,e</a>). However, this variant did bind to membranes composed of both PtdSer and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>), indicating a synergistic activity of PtdSer and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> towards syt-1 C2AB fragment binding."

However, in full-length syt-1, the C2 domains are tethered near the membrane interface and thus experience a very high local lipid concentration. Assuming the domains lie within 4 nm of the interface, the effective membrane concentration seen by the C2 domains will be well over four orders of magnitude higher than 20 \u00b5M. This represents a shift in the binding free energy to favor membrane association by about 25 kJ/mole,\u00a0may be even higher when considering that syntaxin and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> form clusters that increase the local concentration of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib32\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">van den Bogaart et al., 2011</a>).

As discussed below, the relative affinity of the\u00a0C2AB fragment for PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> versus its affinity for the SNAREs suggests that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is the likely target of the polybasic patch of the\u00a0C2B domain, in agreement with recent reports (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wang, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 2015</a>).

Phosphatidylinositol phosphates are lipids that only differ from each other in the number of phosphate groups and/or the phospho site of the inositol ring, with different species being specifically associated with different intracellular membranes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chasserot-Golaz et al., 2010</a>). To gain insight into the binding of syt-1 to different phosphatidylinositols, we measured the binding kinetics of the C2AB fragment to vesicles containing 55% phosphatidylcholine (PtdChol), 22% phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEth), 11% phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), 11% cholesterol (Chol) and 1% of different phosphatidylinositols (PtdInsP<sub>x</sub>). Phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides increased the apparent affinities (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>), with the bimolecular association (<i>k</i><sub>on</sub>) and the unimolecular dissociation rate (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>) constants being enhanced and reduced, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b,c</a>). The 5\u201310-fold decrease in <i>k</i><sub>off</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>/<i>k</i><sub>on</sub>) was progressively higher in the presence of bisphosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (PtdInsP<sub>2</sub>) and triphosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (PtdInsP<sub>3</sub>) than in the\u00a0presence of monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (PtdInsP) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a,c</a>). While PtdInsP<sub>2</sub> or PtdInsP<sub>3</sub> increased the association rate constant moderately by 2\u20133-fold, PtdInsP or phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) had no measurable effect on the binding kinetics (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). Thus, these results suggest that syt-1 does not discriminate between the different tested phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol stereoisomers, and that the increase in affinity is mainly due to the higher charge density of the different PtdInsP<sub>x</sub> species. Our findings are in contrast to those\u00a0of\u00a0a recent study that came to a different conclusion based on a lipid overlay and a binding sensor assay (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vrljic et al., 2011</a>). To further examine these conflicting results, we measured the binding of the head groups of different phosphatidylinositol phosphates to the C2B domain of syt-1 using ITC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). Surprisingly, Ins(1,3,5)P<sub>3</sub> showed lower affinity than the other tested stereoisomers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>) because of a less favorable binding enthalpy (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Intriguingly, the negatively charged binding site of the\u00a0C2B domain also reduces the affinity of this domain for PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by electrostatic repulsion (see model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, left). In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, several effects operate synergistically to increase membrane affinity. First, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding polarizes the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the\u00a0C2B domain and PtdSer completes the coordination sphere of the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>, allowing syt-1 to penetrate into the membrane. Second, the neutralization of charge at the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site of the\u00a0C2B domain reduces electrostatic repulsion at the polybasic region and promotes the association of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, right). This cross-talk between the two sites explains the\u00a0conflicting conclusions regarding the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites and the polybasic lysine patch in binding to anionic membrane lipids. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites preferentially bind to PtdSer, for which they form a defined binding pocket (<a href=\"#bib32\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>) but not to phosphoinositides, in contrast to previous suggestions (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vrljic et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">van den Bogaart et al., 2012</a>).

In particular, we\u00a0need\u00a0to clarify whether there is synergism or competition between syt binding to SNAREs and syt\u00a0binding to acidic membrane lipids during the\u00a0triggering of exocytosis. Clearly, the polybasic patch of the C2B domain is involved in SNARE binding with high affinity as shown earlier (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>) and as\u00a0confirmed by our ITC data. Moreover, mutations that\u00a0impair syt\u2013SNARE binding also alter syt-membrane binding; in addition, they alter the\u00a0triggering of exocytosis when the corresponding mutants are introduced into neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). However, the available evidence suggests that the polybasic region preferentially interacts with PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> rather than with SNAREs under normal ionic conditions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). For example, pulse EPR and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy indicate that the Syt\u2013PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interaction persists under conditions that eliminate the syt\u2013SNARE interaction (<a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 2015</a>), and the data presented here in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g,i</a> show that InsP<sub>3</sub> binding to the C2AB fragment is only slightly affected by the presence of the SNAREs. Nevertheless, the syt\u2013SNARE interaction is conformationally heterogeneous and quite dynamic, and sites other than the polybasic patch may interact with the SNAREs in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2.</sub> This may result in a more complex interplay between PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, SNARE proteins and syt-1 under physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>)."

For instance, all models trying to picture synaptotagmin complexes with partially zippered SNARE complexes face serious spatial challenges when trying to fit them into a 3D-model between the vesicle and plasma membrane, particularly when considering that both Munc18 and Munc13 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ma et al., 2013</a>) (or even the larger CAPS proteins [<a href=\"#bib18\">Daily et al., 2010</a>]) are thought to be bound to such activated SNARE complexes. Moreover, synaptotagmins or other C2 domain proteins are not required for the basic and evolutionarily conserved SNARE engine. They do not participate in other intracellular fusion reactions and are lacking altogether in more primitive eukaryotic cells such as yeast (<a href=\"#bib16\">Craxton, 2010</a>). Moreover, the canonical function of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding C2 domains appears to be binding to acidic membrane lipids (<a href=\"#bib15\">Corbalan-Garcia and Gomez-Fernandez, 2014</a>), see also <a href=\"http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/.\">http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/.</a> This is true for soluble proteins whose Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent translocation to plasma membranes is mediated by C2 domains (classical examples include protein kinase C and phospholipase A), and also for transmembrane proteins owning multiple tandem C2 domains, such as ferlins and extended-synaptotagmins (see e.g <a href=\"#bib34\">Idevall-Hagren et al. (2015</a>); <a href=\"#bib24\">Fernandez-Busnadiego et al. (2015</a>); <a href=\"#bib45\">Pangr\u0161i\u010d et al. (2012)</a>)."

Binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases the dwell time of syt-1 on the membrane by allowing\u00a0more intimate contact with the bilayer rather than by promoting an enhanced synaptotagmin\u2013membrane association. The model that we propose in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> is in accordance with data from functional experiments carried out in intact synapses. For instance, mutations in the C2B domain polybasic lysine patch reduce the amplitude of the fast component of EPSC in excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, InsP<sub>6</sub> (which binds to the syt-1 polybasic lysine patch [<a href=\"#bib38\">Joung et al., 2012</a>]) suppresses autaptic EPSCs via the C2B domain of syt-1 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yang et al., 2012</a>) and weakens the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of syt-1 to membranes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lu et al., 2002</a>). Thus, the docking/priming function of the polybasic lysine patch facilitates release but is not essential since the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites remain intact and still allow for binding to PtdSer and membrane insertion. Indeed, increasing PtdSer concentrations increase the frequency of fusion events in PC12 cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, mutated\u00a0proteins in which the hydrophobicity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of syt-1 C2 domains were increased enhanced both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane binding and neurotransmitter release in autaptic hippocampal cultures (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rhee et al., 2005</a>). Additionally, a recent report determining the ultrastructure of the mouse hippocampal organotypic culture revealed a reduction of synaptic vesicles within 0\u20135 nm of the active zone in syt-1 KO synapses. This\u00a0report\u00a0supports our model, in which syt-1 continuously probes the plasma membrane in the latest steps of the docking/priming process (<a href=\"#bib35\">Imig et al., 2014</a>)."

While, as discussed above, the role of SNARE binding is controversial (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bacaj et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 2015</a>), it is largely accepted that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-enhanced binding to acidic membrane lipids is crucial for triggering\u00a0exocytosis. Our data suggest\u00a0that two features of the syt-1\u2013membrane interaction play a crucial role: (i) the membrane insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops rather than an exclusively electrostatic membrane adsorption, and (ii) an increased dwell time of the protein on the membrane surface resulting\u00a0from\u00a0an elevated kinetic stability of the syt-1\u2013membrane complex. In particular, the latter finding was unexpected. It is conceivable that the increased dwell time brings the membranes closer together and thus triggers the firing of SNARE complexes. It is also conceivable that the deeper insertion into the membrane destabilizes the bilayer at the prefusion contact site and thus helps to overcome the energy barrier towards fusion. Hopefully, our findings will trigger novel approaches towards elucidating the molecular mechanism of the still enigmatic triggering event in neuronal exocytosis."

Briefly, to the high-resolution NMR structure for the C2B domain (PDB ID: 1K5W [<a href=\"#bib23\">Fernandez et al., 2001</a>]) the site-scan feature of the software package MMM (<a href=\"#bib47\">Polyhach et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Polyhach and Jeschke, 2010</a>) was used in conjunction with the warsh rotameric library to determine possible rotamers for the positions of interest. The most probable rotamer was then attached to each site. The depth parameters shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> were used as point-to-plane distance restraints and the labeled structure was subjected to simulated annealing and energy minimization to dock the domain to the membrane interface. The spin label atoms and all protein backbone atoms were fixed for the duration of the simulated annealing runs. For these point-to-plane restraints, the distance range was set to the uncertainty in the label position, which was determined from the experimental error in the membrane depth parameter and the empirically derived calibration curve (<a href=\"#bib31\">Herrick et al., 2006</a>). Approximately 100 structures were generated from each simulated annealing run. The structures were analyzed and figures were generated using the program PyMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger, Cambridge, MA)."

This is a subject that has been investigated extensively for many years, but the authors make a good case that, despite so many studies, we still do not have a clear picture of how negatively charged phospholipids such as PS and phosphoinositide phosphates (particularly PIP2) cooperate (or not) in binding to synaptotagmin-1. This is an area of major interest because it is well established that both calcium-independent and calcium-dependent membrane binding is critical for the role of synaptotagmin-1 as a calcium sensor in fast neurotransmitter release. The results of the paper show that PS and PIP2 synergize to promote synaptotagmin-1 binding in the absence of calcium and, upon calcium binding, enhance the insertion of the C2 domain calcium-binding loops into the lipid bilayer, that calcium enhance PIP2 binding by making the electrostatic potential more positive, and that the enhancements of the affinity of synaptotagmin-1 for membranes caused by phosphoinositides arise from reductions in the dissociation rates."

Thus, the manuscript would benefit greatly by describing previous results (see for a partial list below) in a balanced fashion and then placing the results of this study into historic perspective. The reviewers also raised a number of substantive issues outlined below, and additional experiments are suggested to strengthen studies of the polybasic region, and to reconcile their results with another recently published study (Wang et al. <i>eLife</i> 2016)."

However, their NMR data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>) is in apparent contradiction with this conclusion. It is unlikely that the observed chemical shift changes (which span residues more than 30 angstroms apart) can be explained by PIP2 binding to a single site. The NMR data are much more easily explained by a model whereby PIP2 can quickly switch between different binding modes along the polybasic region (which includes six basic residues along a single \u03b2-strand plus additional basic residues in nearby strands), and also the calcium-binding region. This notion does not contradict the approximately 1:1 stoichiometry measured by the authors, as one single molecule of PIP2 could move around the polybasic region and its strong negative potential would hinder binding of a second PIP2 molecule to the region. The overall lack of a specific, defined binding site is supported by the lack of specificity for different stereoisomers of phosphatidylinositols shown by the authors (subsection \u201cPhosphoinosites and Ca<sup>2+</sup> decrease dissociation rate of synaptotagmin-1\u201d, first paragraph)."

Without comparing the effects of mutations in all the residues of the polybasic region, it is difficult to draw conclusions about specificity for a single, well-defined binding site. Studies with additional mutations would strengthen this part of the manuscript. And one should also consider that the side chains of K326 and K327 are on opposite sides of a \u03b2 strand."

The ITC data of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4G,H</a> indicate tighter binding of Syt1 to the SNARE complex than to InsP<sub>3</sub>; hence, it seems difficult to draw a strong conclusion that PIP2 binding should dominate in vivo, as the local concentrations of both PIP2 and SNARE complex will be much higher than in these experiments and both interactions can cooperate with PS binding to other parts of Syt1.

However, as the authors point out, the ITC data are rather noisy, so they should be interpreted with caution.

However, their NMR data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>) is in apparent contradiction with this conclusion. It is unlikely that the observed chemical shift changes (which span residues more than 30 angstroms apart) can be explained by PIP2 binding to a single site. The NMR data are much more easily explained by a model whereby PIP2 can quickly switch between different binding modes along the polybasic region (which includes six basic residues along a single \u03b2-strand plus additional basic residues in nearby strands), and also the calcium-binding region. This notion does not contradict the approximately 1:1 stoichiometry measured by the authors, as one single molecule of PIP2 could move around the polybasic region and its strong negative potential would hinder binding of a second PIP2 molecule to the region. The overall lack of a specific, defined binding site is supported by the lack of specificity for different stereoisomers of phosphatidylinositols shown by the authors (subsection \u201cPhosphoinosites and Ca<sup>2+</sup> decrease dissociation rate of synaptotagmin-1\u201d, first paragraph).</i>"

This is consistent with the electrostatic nature of the interaction and the fact that there is a lack of specificity for different isomers of this charged lipid headgroup. To make this point clear, we modified the statements within the Results and the Discussion so as not to mislead the reader."

Our goal was not to completely define the InsP<sub>3</sub> binding region, but rather to demonstrate the role of the polybasic region of C2B domain in PIP<sub>2</sub> binding. To this end, we decided to use the KAKA mutant because it has been widely studied and is reported to have a dramatic effect on PIP<sub>2</sub> binding (Li et al., 2006, van den Bogaart et al., 2012). Our ITC results support this conclusion, showing that InsP<sub>3</sub> binds specifically to the polybasic region determined by our NMR data.

We agree that the high local concentration of lipids will favor binding, but the authors should make the same consideration with respect to SNARE complex binding to Syt1. Note that this issue is ignored in the aforementioned paragraph and again in the second paragraph of the Discussion where they mention the lack of SNARE complex binding to Syt1 at physiological ionic strength. The ITC data of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a> indicate tighter binding of Syt1 to the SNARE complex than to InsP<sub>3</sub>; hence, it seems difficult to draw a strong conclusion that PIP2 binding should dominate in vivo, as the local concentrations of both PIP2 and SNARE complex will be much higher than in these experiments and both interactions can cooperate with PS binding to other parts of Syt1. We suggest that the authors make a more balanced discussion of the data and leave the issue of whether PIP2 or the SNARE complex 'wins' open.</i>"

Upon mutation of the two lysine residues in the polybasic region (KAKA mutant), the interaction apparently becomes weaker. However, as the authors point out, the ITC data are rather noisy, so they should be interpreted with caution. In fact, the group of one of the reviewers (ATB) tried to reproduce the result with the KAKA mutant, and found conditions that revealed a much more significant interaction between the mutated C2B domain and SNARE complex than <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a> might suggest, consistent with the primary interface observed by Zhou et al. (2015). However, since different constructs were used, this discrepancy requires further investigation that is probably outside the scope of this work.</i>"
