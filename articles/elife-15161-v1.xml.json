Two seemingly conflicting models have been proposed for its function: one proposes that MYC enhances expression of all genes, while the other model suggests gene-specific regulation. Here, we have explored the hypothesis that specific gene expression profiles arise since promoters differ in affinity for MYC and high-affinity promoters are fully occupied by physiological levels of MYC. We determined cellular MYC levels and used RNA- and ChIP-sequencing to correlate promoter occupancy with gene expression at different concentrations of MYC. Mathematical modeling showed that binding affinities for interactions of MYC with DNA and with core promoter-bound factors, such as WDR5, are sufficient to explain promoter occupancies observed in vivo. Importantly, promoter affinity stratifies different biological processes that are regulated by MYC, explaining why tumor-specific MYC levels induce specific gene expression programs and alter defined biological properties of cells."

Two seemingly conflicting models have been proposed for its function: one proposes that MYC enhances expression of all genes, while the other model suggests gene-specific regulation. Here, we have explored the hypothesis that specific gene expression profiles arise since promoters differ in affinity for MYC and high-affinity promoters are fully occupied by physiological levels of MYC. We determined cellular MYC levels and used RNA- and ChIP-sequencing to correlate promoter occupancy with gene expression at different concentrations of MYC. Mathematical modeling showed that binding affinities for interactions of MYC with DNA and with core promoter-bound factors, such as WDR5, are sufficient to explain promoter occupancies observed in vivo. Importantly, promoter affinity stratifies different biological processes that are regulated by MYC, explaining why tumor-specific MYC levels induce specific gene expression programs and alter defined biological properties of cells."

One example of an oncogene encodes for a protein called MYC and many tumors contain high levels of this protein.

Further studies may show that the altered regulation of a tumor-specific set of genes is important for tumor development and could use this new information to identify new targets for treating MYC-driven tumors."

One hypothesis to explain this observation suggests that MYC proteins globally enhance transcription. This has been termed the general amplifier model (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nie et al., 2012</a>) and is supported by observations that MYC can cause an increase in total RNA and mRNA levels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grandori et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hsu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nie et al., 2012</a>). In this model, specific gene expression patterns arise indirectly due to feedback and feedforward loops induced by general amplification. The alternative viewpoint suggests that MYC proteins regulate specific genes and that global changes in RNA and mRNA levels occur indirectly as a consequence of MYC-driven cell growth (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sab\u00f2 and Amati, 2014</a>). To explain the contrast between global binding and specific gene regulation, the latter model proposes that much of MYC binding to chromatin is non-productive in terms of transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kress et al., 2015</a>)."

We showed previously that doxycycline-induced overexpression of MYC in these cells establishes a gene expression signature, which closely resembles multiple established signatures of MYC target genes and identifies expression signatures of patients with MYC amplification in tumors (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walz et al., 2014</a>). Hence, these cells represent a simple model system, in which the effect of physiological and tumor-specific MYC levels can be compared and provide a tool to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which activation of a globally\u00a0binding transcription factor can result in regulation of specific and functionally relevant gene expression patterns."

To illustrate this point, we determined MYC levels in a number of normal and transformed cells. Lysates of equal numbers of exponentially growing cells were probed by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The results show that U2OS cells express levels of MYC that are comparable to non-transformed cells (IMEC, HMLE, MCF10A) and lower than those found in other tumor cell lines (HeLa and HCT116). Notably, prolonged exposure (&gt;3 days) to doxycycline and hence long-term ectopic expression of MYC induces apoptosis in U2OS cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walz et al., 2014</a>); therefore, all subsequent analyses were performed 28\u201330\u2009hr after addition of doxycycline."

Different peak calling programs (MACS14, SICER, CCAT) with default parameters result in very similar peak numbers (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Reducing the stringency of peak calling resulted in a moderate increase in peak number but a large increase in the number of negative peaks, suggesting that an analysis using default parameters does not overlook a large number of significant peaks (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In agreement with reports from other systems, we concluded that the promoters of the majority of all expressed genes are bound by MYC. Surprisingly, individual promoters showed a wide range of occupancies for endogenous MYC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>), whereas the differences in occupancy by MYC among promoters were much smaller after induction with doxycycline (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Promoters, which are least strongly bound by endogenous MYC recruit most MYC upon overexpression (i.e. <i>VEGFA</i>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), whereas the most strongly bound genes recruit no additional MYC (i.e. <i>RPL8</i>). This prompted us to analyze whether the anti-correlation between occupancy by endogenous MYC and recruitment of exogenous MYC is evident globally (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). To this end, we determined the relative MYC recruitment at each bound promoter by calculating the fold-change of MYC occupancy in cells with exogenous and endogenous MYC levels. Genes were ranked according to these MYC recruitment values and plotted against the respective occupancy of endogenous MYC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, blue dots). Strikingly, genes, which are most weakly bound (mean: 89 tags), recruit MYC most strongly (5.3-fold), whereas the most strongly bound genes (mean: 580 tags) show on average no further MYC recruitment. Importantly, when MYC occupancy at exogenous MYC levels is analyzed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, orange dots), all bins of genes are bound to a high extent. One way to explain this observation is the hypothesis that genes strongly bound by endogenous MYC levels are fully occupied ('saturated') and hence exogenous MYC is preferentially recruited to weakly bound genes."

If promoters were fully occupied by MYC/MAX heterodimers, one would predict that MXD proteins are completely displaced from these promoters. We tested this prediction by ChIP assays on four genes using an anti-MXD6 (MNT) antibody (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Binding of MXD6 was barely detectable above background for the two genes (<i>NPM1, NCL</i>), which are strongly occupied by endogenous MYC, and did not further decrease upon addition of doxycycline. In contrast, MXD6 occupancy was higher for two genes (<i>HSPBAP1, FBX32</i>), which are poorly bound by endogenous MYC, but strongly decreased upon induction of MYC. Taken together, the easiest model to explain the data is to suggest that a few hundred of promoters are saturated by endogenous MYC in U2OS cells and that overexpression of MYC leads to saturation of the majority of MYC-binding sites in promoters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

We then used defined quantities of this fragment to calibrate a series of immunoblots. After complete transfer of both, the recombinant protein and cellular MYC (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), membranes were probed with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes an epitope (EQKLISEEDL) corresponding to amino acids 410 to 419 of human MYC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>).

We modeled the binding behavior of MYC assuming canonical E-boxes and unspecific binding sites at random DNA sequences, which are in excess over the canonical E-boxes (model 1, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, Appendix 1). This model ignores competition of MYC/MAX heterodimers with other E-box binding proteins with the same binding specificity, such as MXD/MAX complexes, as well as MITF, USF and TFE-3 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Conacci-Sorrell et al., 2014</a>). We explored how the occupancy of canonical E-boxes in the experimentally determined range of cellular MYC concentrations depends on the dissociation constants of MYC reversibly binding to canonical E-boxes (<i>K<sub>Ebox</sub></i>) or unspecific binding sites (<i>K<sub>NNNNNN</sub></i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; note that all simulations show steady state solutions discussed in Appendix 1). The simulations demonstrate that occupancies of canonical E-boxes above 90% can be observed for certain combinations of dissociation constants. In contrast, occupancy of unspecific binding sites is much smaller than 1% in the considered parameter space (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) illustrating that the number of unspecific binding sites strongly exceeds the number of canonical E-boxes (Appendix 1). The model assumes that the entire genome is accessible and not blocked due to heterochromatin formation. An extended analysis investigating the impact of heterochromatin (Appendix 2) confirms that our assumption on genome accessibility hardly affects our presented results and conclusions. Values of dissociation constants have been previously determined for canonical E-boxes and for DNA with a non-E-box sequence. We fixed the dissociation constants in our subsequent model analyses to one pair of published values (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2014</a>) (see red and blue lines in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). The respective occupancies of canonical E-boxes and unspecific binding sites in the experimentally determined range of total MYC abundance are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> (red and blue lines, respectively). Under these assumptions, MYC/MAX complexes are predicted to bind canonical E-boxes with a calculated EC<sub>50</sub> value of 1x10<sup>2\u00a0</sup>\u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Comparison with the experimentally determined EC<sub>50</sub> values showed that only 363 of 8,425 promoters show this or a higher EC<sub>50</sub> value."

Model simulations predict that a reduction of the dissociation constant of MYC and E-boxes by about one order of magnitude shifts the EC<sub>50</sub> value into the measured range of MYC molecules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). To explore potential underlying molecular mechanisms, we searched for features, which identify promoters with high affinity for MYC. Consistent with the DNA binding properties, we found a strong correlation between the occupancy of endogenous MYC and the occurrence of canonical E-box sequences in the binding region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F</a>). In contrast, non-consensus E-box sequences are only moderately enriched in MYC peaks and their frequency does not positively correlate with MYC binding (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B,D-F</a>). In addition to canonical E-box sequences in the binding region, occupancy by endogenous MYC positively correlated with overall expression of the respective gene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and with features of open chromatin, such as trimethylation of histone H3K4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This observation is in agreement with several previous reports (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guccione et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nie et al., 2012</a>). Recent work has identified WDR5, a WD40-repeat-containing protein, which is a part of the MLL/SET methyltransferases that methylate H3K4 and the MOF/NSL histone acetyltransferases that acetylate histone H4, as a direct interaction partner of MYC (<a href=\"#bib44\">Thomas et al., 2015</a>). MYC binds to WDR5 with a K<sub>D</sub> of 9.3 \u00b5M via MYC BoxIII (<a href=\"#bib44\">Thomas et al., 2015</a>), a domain that is not part of the DNA-binding domain, suggesting that binding of MYC to WDR5 occurs independently of binding to DNA. A modified model (model 2; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; see also Appendix 1) that assumes (i) that WDR5 is constantly bound to its target sites (ii) that MYC and WDR5 are free to bind to each other when both are bound to chromatin in close proximity predicts an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.014 \u00b5M for MYC occupancy of an E-box in the presence of WDR5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). This value is lower than the one estimated experimentally for the large majority of promoters, arguing that the MYC/WDR5 interaction is of sufficient high affinity to explain the high occupancy of promoters with low EC<sub>50</sub> values (7,963/8,425)."

                                "text": "Previously, we found that genes encoding ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis are not regulated in response to doxycycline-mediated MYC overexpression (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walz et al., 2014</a>), supporting the hypothesis that MYC binding sites in their promoters are fully occupied by MYC at endogenous levels. To exclude the possibility that these genes are not regulated by MYC in U2OS cells, we depleted endogenous MYC in U2OS cells by siRNA and analyzed gene expression by RNA-sequencing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>) and MYC binding by ChIP-sequencing (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013G</a>). RNA-sequencing identified 753 genes being down- and 1224 genes being significantly up-regulated (log<sub>2</sub>FC\u00a0&lt; \u22121 or &gt;\u00a01, q-value &lt;\u00a00.01, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Expression data were analyzed by GSEA to identify functional groups of MYC-regulated genes. Strikingly, ribosomal protein genes and genes encoding proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis are most strongly down-regulated upon siRNA treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Accordingly, ChIP-sequencing upon depletion of MYC (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>) demonstrated global loss of MYC binding to high-affinity binding sites (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,D</a>) including promoters of ribosomal protein genes (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). Strikingly, genes, which show the highest affinity for MYC, most strongly respond to depletion of endogenous MYC (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). We confirmed our previous observations that these gene sets are not regulated when MYC is overexpressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). To test whether similar dose-dependent transcriptional responses to MYC are also observed during tumorigenesis, we utilized data from a murine model for MYC-driven B cell lymphomagenesis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013H</a>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014</a>). Expression profiles are published for three different conditions, (i) resting B cells expressing only low levels of endogenous MYC ('control'), (ii) proliferating B cells expressing intermediate levels of MYC from the E\u00b5-MYC transgene ('pre-tumor') and (iii) transformed B cells selected for very high MYC expression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014</a>). Strikingly, ribosomal protein genes, hence the genes with lowest EC<sub>50</sub> values, are strongly induced when the pre-tumor condition is compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,H</a>). In contrast, expression of ribosomal protein genes does not increase further when tumors are compared with pre-tumor cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>), although MYC protein levels increase about eight fold (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014</a>). Conversely, some genes that are regulated by exogenous MYC in U2OS cells and have low-affinity promoters, like those encoding transmembrane transporters, are also regulated when comparing the tumor to pre-tumor condition in B cell lymphomagenesis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H,I</a>). Therefore, we propose that selective transcriptional responses by MYC at physiological and oncogenic levels are similar <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>."

Gene sets, which are strongly regulated upon overexpression, for\u00a0example, genes involved in angiogenesis and cell migration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>, orange boxplots), show a significantly higher median EC<sub>50</sub> value than gene sets derived from the depletion of endogenous MYC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>, blue boxplots). We noted that also genes involved in circadian rhythm are regulated upon MYC overexpression and showed high EC<sub>50</sub> values, consistent with the recent demonstration that disruption of the circadian clock is a critical transforming function of MYC (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altman et al., 2015</a>). We concluded that binding affinity determines specific MYC-mediated transcriptional responses at physiological and oncogenic MYC concentrations. To further support this conclusion, we analyzed expression data from embryonic fibroblasts isolated from mice that carry floxed <i>MYC</i> alleles (<a href=\"#bib33\">Perna et al., 2012</a>). Strikingly, EC<sub>50</sub> values of genes that are down-regulated upon deletion of endogenous MYC are very low (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>, green boxplot) confirming that, as in U2OS cells, at physiological levels MYC regulates genes with the highest binding affinity. In view of reports, which demonstrate that altering cellular metabolism is a transforming mechanism of MYC (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stine et al., 2015</a>), we analyzed the affinity of promoters of genes encoding proteins involved in selected metabolic processes and indeed observed elevated EC<sub>50</sub> values for lipid- and purine metabolism and potentially glycolysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>, violet boxplots)."

We wondered, if there are indeed two distinct modes of regulation or if MYC-mediated responses rather vary continually upon changes in cellular MYC concentrations. To test this, we gradually manipulated MYC levels in U2OS<sup>Tet-On</sup> cells by titrating the amount of doxycycline and calculated the absolute number of MYC molecules in triplicate experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>). Analysis of gene expression profiles at five different concentrations of doxycycline revealed different response patterns for different gene sets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), ranging from hardly any response to MYC overexpression ('structural constituent of ribosome'), medium-level responses ('ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis'), to gene sets, which responded predominantly at very high MYC levels ('substrate-specific transporter activity'). The RNA-sequencing data enabled us to calculate EC<sub>50</sub> values for regulation and to correlate them with EC<sub>50</sub> values for binding. Importantly, the observed differences in dose response correlate with the promoter affinity of the genes involved in these processes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Direct MYC-mediated repression largely depends on complex formation with MIZ1 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Peukert et al., 1997</a>), which is strongly reduced when expressing a point mutant of MYC (MYC<sup>V394D</sup>). By using previously published datasets (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walz et al., 2014</a>), we identified direct MYC-repressed sets of genes assuming that they are re-expressed if MIZ1 is depleted (shMIZ1) or if MYC<sup>V394D</sup> instead of wild type MYC is expressed. Interestingly MYC/MIZ1-mediated repression takes place at high levels of MYC, both in a global analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) as well as for individual genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Accordingly, genes directly repressed by MYC ('Down (direct)' in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), show significantly higher EC<sub>50</sub> values than transactivated genes ('Up'), whereas indirectly repressed genes ('Down (indirect)' in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) show affinities comparable to that of transactivated genes. We concluded that direct MYC-mediated repression is a predominant form of transcriptional regulation at high (oncogenic) levels of MYC, which may not be reached during normal cell growth (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>)."

This result is in agreement with experimental observations showing that the positions occupied by MYC/MAX complexes across the human genome closely correlate with the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery even on promoters, which do not contain E-boxes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guccione et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). The conclusion is based on a modeling approach that assumes two classes of binding sites, a high-affinity class of binding sites with consensus E-boxes and a second class of binding sites containing non-specific DNA. This assumption is an over-simplification, since MYC/MAX complexes have low affinity for binding sites containing non-consensus E-box sequences, which exceeds the affinity for non-specific DNA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blackwell et al., 1993</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). Furthermore, multiple other transcription factors recognize the same consensus sequence as MYC/MAX proteins, suggesting that there is significant competition for E-box binding among these complexes in cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wolf et al., 2015</a>). As a consequence, the current model overestimates the fraction of MYC/MAX complexes bound to consensus E-boxes. These considerations reinforce the conclusion that DNA binding alone cannot account for the high occupancies of core promoters by MYC/MAX complexes in cells."

Consistent with this finding, a mutant allele of MYC unable to bind to WDR5 shows much reduced binding to high-affinity promoters. MYC does not only interact with WDR5, but with several components of the transcription machinery including P-TEFb, TBP and TRRAP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouchard et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Eberhardy and Farnham, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hateboer et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">McMahon et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, we recently identified the interaction of another conserved domain of MYC, MYC BoxI, with the PAF1C complex that is located at core promoters (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jaenicke et al., 2016</a>). We restricted our analysis to WDR5, since no dissociation constants for other protein/protein interactions of MYC have been published. However, MYC high-affinity binding sites can be observed at genomic regions, which are not in proximity to WDR5 binding sites, suggesting that other factors are involved in establishing MYC genomic binding pattern. Future ChIP-sequencing studies of MYC upon depletion of MYC interaction proteins will clarify the impact of individual factors on chromatin binding of MYC."

We propose that the dependence of MYC/MAX chromatin binding on interactions with proteins that are themselves influenced by existing gene expression patterns at different physiological states of cells, contributes to specific gene regulation by MYC even though MYC\u00b4s mechanism of action is the same at all promoters (as an example, see <a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al.

Our results show that promoters differ in their apparent affinity for MYC and demonstrate a close correlation between apparent promoter affinity measured by ChIP-sequencing and response to different concentrations of MYC measured by RNA-sequencing at different MYC levels. This correlation leads to the conclusion that a gene is regulated by MYC in a given experimental setting, if the occupancy of its promoter (or a relevant enhancer) by MYC changes in this setting. Importantly, measurements of MYC levels and modeling approaches show that promoters can be saturated by levels of MYC that are reached in proliferating cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). As a result, expression of genes may not respond to MYC in a certain experimental setting (such as a doxycycline-mediated induction of high MYC levels) since the promoters are fully occupied before addition of doxycycline. This is likely to be true for strongly transcribed genes as many ribosomal protein genes and genes encoding proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation. The experimentally observed specificity in gene regulation can therefore be explained without the need to invoke productive and non-productive modes of interaction of MYC with chromatin."

This is seen when pre-tumorigenic B-cells are compared with control lymphocytes. MYC levels further increase at the transition to frank lymphomas and there is clear evidence for further increases in MYC levels during progression of several tumor entities, as for example in APC-mutant colorectal tumors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kress et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Myant and Sansom, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Siemens et al., 2011</a>). This additional increase in MYC levels will enhance occupancy of promoters that are lowly occupied in normal and proliferating cells. Since differences in apparent affinity and in EC<sub>50</sub> values stratify classes of promoters of genes that encode proteins that differ in function, we propose that this will alter the physiological and metabolic state (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stine et al., 2015</a>) of the tumor cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Notably, promoters with the lowest apparent affinity are found in genes that encode proteins involved in nutrient transport, G-protein coupled receptors and in the response to hypoxia. Expression of these genes responds to further increases in MYC levels arguing that they are the basis for the selective pressure for increases in MYC levels. Since many tumors depend on ('are addicted to') high MYC levels, inhibition of proteins encoded by this class of target genes can be a rational strategy for selective inhibition of MYC-dependent tumor growth."

Fixed cells were treated with blocking solution (10% horse serum, 2% BSA and 5% sucrose in PBS) for 45 min after washing. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and incubated for 1\u2009hr with the corresponding fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies at room temperature after washing (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20). Cells were mounted on object glass slides using aqua-fluoromount (Sigma) after washing and imaged under a confocal microscope (Nikon Ti-Eclipse). For fluorescent intensity measurement, ImageJ 1.50hr (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>) was used. Briefly, z stacked confocal images were converted to 12-bit images via maximum intensity projection and ROI assigned using ROI tool. The intensity was measured per cell nuclei for Hoechst and MYC. The fold change distribution of MYC was calculated by first taking MYC intensity normalized to Hoechst and then further normalizing the values to the median of the set of measurements. Finally Log<sub>2</sub> of the median normalized values were displayed as density plots on R using 'sm' library density function."

By measuring MYC DNA binding affinities, its association with WDR5, the authors were able to stratify promoters by change in MYC occupancy. The data indicate that low-affinity promoters show the greatest increase in MYC recruitment at high levels of MYC whereas the high affinity promoters show very little change over the same range. This result is similar to that of Fernandez et al. (Fernandez PC Genes & Dev 2003) that employed large-scale ChIP to propose MYC occupancy dependance by promoter affinity. Using mathematical modeling, Lorenzin et al. are able to assign a binding affinity to each promoter (EC50) and make the intriguing conclusion that E box binding alone is not strong enough to explain how MYC is tethered to the majority of its DNA targets. Finally, the authors measure gene expression by titrating the level of MYC which, consistent with their model, reveals a correlation between promoter affinity and the level to which expression from these genes was increased. Specifically, they demonstrate that high-affinity binding sites are almost fully occupied by MYC and could not be further bound, resulting in a seemingly lack of gene activation by ectopic MYC. This is best illustrated in an artificial system of U2OS cells that have relatively low MYC levels despite being a cancer cell line. Upon activation of ectopic MYC, genes encoding ribosome biogenesis genes, which have high-affinity MYC binding sites, could not be further bound and hence do not seem to be activated. However, knockdown of endogenous MYC in U2OS cells resulted in diminished binding of MYC and expression of ribosome biogenesis genes. By monitoring MXD at E-boxes, the authors show an in vivo competition with MYC that is sensitive to MYC levels. The authors also show that MIZ repression explains most of the negative gene regulation with MYC that is again dependent on the level of MYC binding. Overexpression of MYC, on the other hand, results in MYC binding to lower affinity sites, resulting in ectopic activation of genes such as those involved in angiogenesis and suppression of cell adhesion genes. The authors also use publicly available data for the MYC-mediated mouse lymphoma and also documented MYC's role in inducing ribosome biogenesis genes (which was previously documented by Ji et al. PLoS One 2011). Using data deposited on WDR5, the authors corroborate the role of WDR5 in recruiting MYC to DNA for gene regulation. In addition, the experimental data, the authors also provide mathematical modeling, providing further insights into how MYC binding affinities affect gene expression and drive specific biological functions."

Nature 2014; extended <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), resulting in cell death upon prolonged exposure to high MYC levels (&gt;3days). This nuance could well skew MYC's ectopic activities that are specific for this cell line and hence not generalizable to cancer cells driven by high MYC such as Burkitt's lymphoma or neuroblastoma. For example, the authors should compare the 'ectopic' MYC targets among the different datasets (U2OS, Emu-MYC normal-pretumor-tumor samples, and other datasets referenced in the manuscript). Are there cell-type-independent MYC ectopic target genes similar to cell-type-independent core MYC targets that are involved in ribosome biogenesis?"

At the very least, the authors should perform ChIPseq upon MYC knock-down in their U2OS model and determine promoter occupancy to complement their gene expression experiments."

From the heat map across all genes it appears that MYC follows a monotonic binding pattern all the way to the bottom (I don't see a negative region in the heat map) \u2013 in contrast the accounting of MYC positive versus negative promoters is highly dependent on the selection of p-values and/or false discovery rates to create an arbitrary distinction between + and \u2013. Some discussion of this may be warranted. Perhaps the negative peaks simply reflect a continuum of MYC binding as it slides below the level of the technical background."
