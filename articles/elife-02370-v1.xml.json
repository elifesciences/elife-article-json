                    "text": "Neuropathic pain remains notoriously difficult to treat despite numerous drug targets. Here, we offer a novel explanation for this intractability. Computer simulations predicted that qualitative changes in primary afferent excitability linked to neuropathic pain arise through a switch in spike initiation dynamics when molecular pathologies reach a tipping point (criticality), and that this tipping point can be reached via several different molecular pathologies (degeneracy). We experimentally tested these predictions by pharmacologically blocking native conductances and/or electrophysiologically inserting virtual conductances. Multiple different manipulations successfully reproduced or reversed neuropathic changes in primary afferents from na\u00efve or nerve-injured rats, respectively, thus confirming the predicted criticality and its degenerate basis. Degeneracy means that several different molecular pathologies are individually sufficient to cause hyperexcitability, and because several such pathologies co-occur after nerve injury, that no single pathology is uniquely necessary. Consequently, single-target-drugs can be circumvented by maladaptive plasticity in any one of several ion channels."

Computer simulations predicted that qualitative changes in primary afferent excitability linked to neuropathic pain arise through a switch in spike initiation dynamics when molecular pathologies reach a tipping point (criticality), and that this tipping point can be reached via several different molecular pathologies (degeneracy). We experimentally tested these predictions by pharmacologically blocking native conductances and/or electrophysiologically inserting virtual conductances. Multiple different manipulations successfully reproduced or reversed neuropathic changes in primary afferents from na\u00efve or nerve-injured rats, respectively, thus confirming the predicted criticality and its degenerate basis. Degeneracy means that several different molecular pathologies are individually sufficient to cause hyperexcitability, and because several such pathologies co-occur after nerve injury, that no single pathology is uniquely necessary. Consequently, single-target-drugs can be circumvented by maladaptive plasticity in any one of several ion channels."

We recently showed through mathematical modeling that all three neuropathic changes arise from a switch in spike initiation dynamics (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rho and Prescott, 2012</a>); there is, therefore, a one-to-many mapping between altered spike initiation dynamics and qualitative changes in cellular excitability. On the other hand, we found a many-to-one mapping between parameter values (whose variations represent injury-induced molecular changes) and cellular excitability; moreover, continuous parameter variations led to a discontinuous change in spike initiation dynamics. The many-to-one mapping constitutes degeneracy and the discontinuity, or tipping point, reflects criticality.

To experimentally test those predictions, we applied different manipulations designed to force neurons in one or the other direction across their tipping point, therein acutely reproducing neuropathic excitability in primary afferent neurons from naive animals or acutely reversing neuropathic excitability in neurons from nerve-injured animals. Manipulations involved decreasing and/or increasing subthreshold currents via pharmacology and/or dynamic clamp, respectively, in identified myelinated primary afferents. All predictions were confirmed, therein supporting our theory that primary afferent hyperexcitability arises through a critical transition whose molecular basis is highly degenerate."

The parameters of this base model were thereafter unchanged. Next, we derived the voltage-dependency and kinetics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) for an additional conductance (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equations 1\u20134</a> in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) which, when added to our base model, modulates its spike initiation dynamics. This conductance corresponds to either a sodium or potassium channel depending on its associated reversal potential and, according to our analysis, must be active at subthreshold voltages. To be clear, the parameters for this conductance were chosen to modulate spike initiation dynamics, not to model specific ion channel types that are known to be altered by nerve injury. That said, although our determination of parameters was agnostic to molecular identities, parameter values resemble those of known channel types, as noted in subsequent sections. We then varied the maximal conductance of the additional conductance(s). Based on two-parameter bifurcation analysis, we determined the combinations of sodium conductance <i>\u1e21</i><sub>Na</sub> and potassium conductance <i>\u1e21</i><sub>K</sub> required to give repetitive spiking at different stimulus thresholds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Somata of myelinated primary afferents normally generate a single spike at stimulus onset, which corresponds to the gray-shaded region, whereas a subset of those neurons spike repetitively after nerve injury (e.g., <a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2002</a>), which corresponds to the colored region."

We repeated this analysis in a model with the <i>\u1e21</i><sub>Na</sub>:<i>\u1e21</i><sub>K</sub> ratio set to give normal excitability (<i>\u1e21</i><sub>Na</sub> = 2.0 \u00b5S/cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>\u1e21</i><sub>K</sub> = 2.5 \u00b5S/cm<sup>2</sup>) or neuropathic excitability (<i>\u1e21</i><sub>Na</sub> = 2.5 \u00b5S/cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>\u1e21</i><sub>K</sub> = 2.0 \u00b5S/cm<sup>2</sup>). Bifurcation diagrams (left) illustrate how the system behaves at different <i>I</i><sub>stim</sub>: a stable fixed point corresponds to quiescence whereas a stable limit cycle corresponds to repetitive spiking. A subcritical Hopf bifurcation is evident in the bottom (<i>Neuropathic</i>) bifurcation diagram but not in the top (<i>Normal</i>) bifurcation diagram, suggesting that repetitive spiking is only possible in the former condition. In both conditions, the <i>I</i><sub>stim</sub> range in which a single spike is produced at stimulus onset is indicated with gray shading. Onset-only spiking is achieved through a quasi-separatrix crossing, independent of any bifurcation. Dotted arrows indicate <i>I</i><sub>stim</sub> values for sample traces on the right. Membrane potential oscillations (MPOs) occur when the fixed point is in proximity to a Hopf bifurcation; after being perturbed by noise, the system relaxes towards its nearly-unstable fixed point following a loose spiral trajectory, which corresponds to MPOs on the time series. In the absence of a Hopf bifurcation, the fixed point is more stable and MPOs are negligible. Repetitive spiking occurs when <i>I</i><sub>stim</sub> exceeds the intensity required for the Hopf bifurcation. Repetitive spiking can also occur in the <i>I</i><sub>stim</sub> range between the Hopf bifurcation and where the stable and unstable limit cycles meet (at a saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles); that region also contains a stable fixed point, meaning that the system is bistable. The neuron will remain in one or the other stable state unless a slow process like adaptation sweeps the system across the bistable region, in which case the neuron will remain quiescent when sweeping rightward toward the Hopf bifurcation, while spiking repetitively when sweeping leftward toward the saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles, thereby producing bursts as a consequence of hysteresis. Bistability and adaptation are both required for bursting."

Furthermore, rather than trying to reproduce a complete set of injury-induced molecular pathologies, our manipulations were designed to reproduce one or two of those pathologies at a time. This approach reveals which molecular pathologies, alone or together, are sufficient to reproduce neuropathic excitability without unaccounted for co-variations in other parameters.

We therefore hypothesized that our repetitively spiking neurons, although capable of bursting, lacked the required adaptation. To test this, we inserted a virtual adaptation current (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). As expected, this enabled bursting under conditions associated with repetitive spiking in all three cells tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) but had no effect in the same three cells under normal conditions with onset-only spiking (data not shown). These data confirm that bursting would have co-developed with repetitive spiking and MPOs if adaptation currents had been present, and suggest that adaptation currents are upregulated after nerve injury (possibly as a compensatory measure) rather than existing occultly in naive neurons whose spiking is already transient."

But as explained in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, variation of a single conductance is not the only way to force a neuron across its tipping point; instead, small changes in more than one conductance may combine to produce a net conductance change that is large enough to force the neuron across its tipping point. As an aside, if multiple small changes can recombine in different ways (which is plausible under conditions in which dozens of different ion channels are up- or down-regulated), then degeneracy could exist on the basis of many different combinations being sufficient to produce neuropathic excitability; in other words, no one set of combined changes would be uniquely necessary just as no single change is uniquely necessary. To explore how conductance changes combine, we proceeded with testing predictions 3 and 4."

As predicted, the sustained outward current activated at perithreshold voltages (\u221250 mV to \u221230 mV) and blocked by 10 nM dendrotoxin was significantly smaller in muscle afferents than in cutaneous afferents (p&lt;0.01; two-way ANOVA and post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test; 1.7 \u00b1 0.6 pA/pF in muscle afferents vs 4.2 \u00b1 0.6 pA/pF in cutaneous afferents after removing variance attributable to voltage) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). With fewer K<sub>V</sub>1 channels available to be blocked, 4-AP and dendrotoxin naturally have a smaller impact on neuronal excitability. However, amongst muscle afferents in which neuropathic excitability was not reproduced by application of 4-AP and in which virtual sodium conductance was subsequently inserted, significantly less sodium conductance was needed to reproduce neuropathic excitability with 4-AP (0.22, range 0.14\u20130.27 nS/pF) than without 4-AP (0.31, range 0.25\u20130.41 nS/pF) (p&lt;0.05; Mann\u2013Whitney U test) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This indicates that 4-AP moves muscle afferents toward their tipping point but simply not far enough to reach it, reminiscent of the effects of nerve injury on cutaneous afferents (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Moreover, although many factors contribute to regulating excitability (\u2018Introduction\u2019), the relatively low expression of K<sub>v</sub>1 channels in muscle afferents likely contributes to them existing closer to their tipping point, as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>."

Some of those changes increase excitability, others are compensatory, and most are irrelevant for (although nonetheless correlated with) hyperexcitability and instead bear on other aspects of cellular function. That said, alterations in cellular excitability cannot be definitively explained without accounting for all \u2018relevant\u2019 changes. This is an insurmountable task if one considers that each neuron experiences different molecular changes and that those changes occur on different molecular backgrounds. However, one can ascertain how close or far a neuron sits from its tipping point based on whether controlled manipulations succeed in forcing the neuron across that point. This requires a theoretical understanding of tipping points (i.e., their nonlinear dynamical basis) to identify telltale signs by which they can be inferred experimentally. It also requires a testing paradigm in which controlled manipulations can be applied, and where unknown changes (differences) do not occur (exist). It is for these reasons that we compared excitability within the same neuron before and after artificial manipulations rather than comparing excitability before and after nerve injury; notably, the latter approach would have necessitated comparison of excitability in separate neurons, each of which is distinct, and is plagued by countless injury-induced changes, not all of which can be simultaneously measured. Moreover, the abruptness of our manipulations precludes compensatory changes from developing. Thus, our approach represents an innovative alternative to experiments using nerve injury models or molecular\u2013genetic techniques in which channel expression is more slowly up- or down-regulated."

Criticality and degeneracy may explain features of neuropathic pain that have hitherto eluded explanation. For instance, neuropathic symptoms often develop at long and highly variable delays after the inciting injury or disease. Criticality can explain this insofar as underlying molecular changes can develop occultly, without obvious outward manifestations, until a tipping point is reached, whereupon symptoms develop abruptly because of gross changes in excitability. Furthermore, once near the tipping point, symptoms could wax or wane because of the system moving forward and backward across its tipping point due to subtle fluctuations in underlying factors. From a therapeutic perspective, an obvious goal is to move the system from the \u2018abnormal\u2019 side of the tipping point back to the \u2018normal\u2019 side. Because of degeneracy, there are many ways to cross the tipping point in the forward direction, and an equally large number of ways to cross back in the reverse direction. This last observation is promising, as is the observation that the neuropathic state seems to lie close to the tipping point. But why then is neuropathic pain so notoriously difficult to treat?"

                        "text": "The answer to the last question hinges on the answer to another question: Why does neuropathic excitability develop in the first place? Degeneracy ought to convey robustness to the regulation of neuronal excitability since effects of pathological molecular changes can be mitigated by compensatory changes in any one of a multitude of other ion channels. But gross changes in excitability do occur, at least in some neurons, and although those changes were easily reversed by our acute manipulations, prolonged therapies in patients and animal models often have only transient effects. One possible explanation is that the homeostatic regulation of excitability is itself deranged, in effect maintaining the system at an incorrect \u2018set point\u2019 and hijacking degeneracy to paradoxically maintain hyperexcitability. In that scenario, therapeutically manipulating only one misregulated conductance will fail to sustainably reverse hyperexcitability if a deranged homeostatic control mechanism can fall back on other conductances to achieve its misguided goal. Instead, all misregulated conductances need to be coordinately targeted. If epilepsy has a similarly degenerate molecular basis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Klassen et al., 2011</a>), it is no wonder that multi-target drugs tend to work well or that polypharmacy with single-target drugs is beneficial (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kwan et al., 2001</a>); indeed, combination pharmacotherapy also offers benefits in the treatment of neuropathic pain (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chaparro et al., 2012</a>). But, alternatively, the deranged control mechanism itself could be commandeered or its set point adjusted. The idea that neuropathic pain reflects the maladaptive homeostatic response to injury rather than being a direct consequence of injury has started to gain traction (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costigan et al., 2009</a>). Our data emphasize the importance of considering the context in which that plasticity occurs, namely, that it occurs within a system that is both complex and degenerate."

Existence of that tipping point demonstrates \u2018criticality\u2019 and speaks to the importance of the nonlinear interactions that give rise to system complexity. Observation that multiple different manipulations can force the system across that tipping point demonstrates \u2018degeneracy\u2019. Criticality and degeneracy are fundamentally important concepts for understanding how complex systems fail, and how to therapeutically intervene to prevent or reverse those failures. Our theory suggests that treatment strategies for neuropathic pain must move away from single-target-drugs and towards a systems-based approach, capitalizing on degeneracy rather than being thwarted by it."

Using gradient contrast optics, neurons with somatic diameter \u226530 \u03bcm were targeted for patching as these give rise to myelinated fibers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harper and Lawson, 1985</a>). Cutaneous or muscle afferents were targeted based on epifluorescent illumination of DiI labeling (and exclusion of Fast Blue labeling in the case of muscle afferents). Cells were recorded in the whole-cell configuration with &gt;70% series resistance compensation using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices; Palo Alto, CA). Electrodes (2\u20135 M\u03a9) were filled with a recording solution containing (in mM) 125 KMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 ATP, 0.4 GTP, as well as 0.1% Lucifer Yellow; pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH and osmolality was between 270 and 290 mosmol/l. The pipette shank was painted with Sylgard to reduce pipette capacitance. Responses were low-pass filtered at 2 KHz, digitized at 20 KHz using a CED 1401 computer interface (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK), and analyzed offline. Membrane potential (after correction for the liquid junction potential of \u22129 mV) was adjusted to \u221265 mV through tonic current injection."

To add virtual conductances, the dynamic clamp technique was applied using Signal 5 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Conductances were modeled using the same equations as in computer simulations, as described above. To account for differences in cell size, values of inserted conductances were converted to densities by normalizing by membrane capacitance <i>C</i>, which was measured from responses to small (\u226450 pA) hyperpolarizing current steps, where <i>C</i> = <i>\u03c4</i><sub>m</sub>/<i>R</i><sub>in</sub>, <i>\u03c4</i><sub>m</sub> is the membrane time constant, and <i>R</i><sub>in</sub> is input resistance. Notably, given a specific membrane capacitance of 1 \u03bcF/cm<sup>2</sup>, a conductance density of 1 mS/cm<sup>2</sup> (as reported for simulations) corresponds to 1 nS/pF (as reported for dynamic clamp experiments)."

The theoretical analyses based on the dynamical systems approach considering just inward and outward spike conductances indicates that multiple mechanisms can move neuron past a critical point that represents the transition from single-spike to repetitive firing. The critical point is in actuality a critical line that itself is subject to movement as other parameters such a leak conductance are varied. Using dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from rat - some identified as cutaneous afferents - and a combination of pharmacological blockade of K currents and addition of Na currents with dynamic clamp, they demonstrate criticality and degeneracy in neuron neurons in the transition studied. Most exciting is the finding that when using DRG neurons that show injury-induced neuropathic-like repetitive firing from a rat model that they can rescue normal single-spike firing with pharmacological blockade of subthreshold Na current or addition of K current with dynamic clamp."

Using computer simulation, pharmacological manipulation and dynamic-clamp electrophysiology, the authors show the existence of a tipping point where primary afferent activity qualitatively switches from single-spiking to tonic spiking in response to current injection, therefore demonstrating the existence of criticality in the behavior of these neurons. Then, the authors show that multiple different manipulations can trigger excitability changes similar to those observed in neuropathic pain, therefore demonstrating the degeneracy of the transition between the physiological and the pathological conditions. The authors argue that the existence of multiple equivalent molecular solutions for the transitions between the physiological and pathological states indicates the potential robustness of both of these states and explains, at least in part, the inefficiency of single-target drugs. Therefore, the authors conclude that new drug design strategies, based on the degeneracy principle, may be needed to treat pathologies such as neuropathic pain, in particular the search for drugs that act on multiple-targets."

This conclusion arises from the fact that the injected conductance needed to trigger the pathological behavior of deep tissue afferents is lower than that needed to cross the tipping point in cutaneous afferents. However, this conclusion is biased, especially in the absence of control experiments measuring the intrinsic excitability and conductance levels in native neurons. In other words, one could easily imagine that deeper tissue afferents display higher input resistance values than cutaneous afferents, and that their channel densities (in particular sodium and potassium channels) are lower than for cutaneous afferents. If this is the case, what should be compared is not the absolute conductance value that needs to be injected to trigger or reverse the pathological state, but conductance values that are adjusted for the differences in input resistance and channel densities between the two neuronal types. It is known that input resistance and channel densities are highly variable within a same cell type but also highly variable between cell types. Such differences may explain the results presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> without invoking the differences in distance between the physiological and pathological states in the two cell types analyzed. Although the conclusion drawn by the authors is very interesting and might be true, the absence of control measurements of the native passive and active properties of the two cell types prevents it from being the only interpretation."

Thus, only 1/9 cells that innervate the hind paw skin from rats with nerve injury showed repetitive firing - and this is the phenomenon that their theoretical work is meant to be examining. The authors do show that when they examine unlabeled neurons (neurons that do not take up DiI injected into the hind-paw skin), most of these cells (6/9) demonstrate repetitive firing.

We cannot do the converse experiment since it is impossible to precisely quantify the amount of potassium current blocked in current clamp experiments. Nonetheless, based on an unsuspected difficulty with pharmacologically converting muscle afferents (despite the ease of converting them with virtual sodium current), we conducted voltage clamp experiments to test whether muscle afferents express less dendrotoxin-sensitive potassium current. We found that this was indeed the case (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) With respect to whether DiI or its vehicle may account for differences between labeled and unlabeled neurons, Zhang et al.

Consistent with past studies, we have confirmed that a significant proportion of muscle afferents are rendered grossly hyperexcitable by nerve injury. This is entirely consistent with our new data showing that uninjured muscle afferents are significantly closer to their tipping point than cutaneous neurons, based on the minimal amount of virtual sodium current needed to produce repetitive spiking. However, we also found that 4-AP application was significantly less likely to produce repetitive spiking in muscle afferents than in cutaneous afferents. This prompted additional experiments which led to a novel finding that muscle afferents have a lower density of dendrotoxin-sensitive potassium current, which may explain why these neurons operate closer to their tipping point. Although these new findings are interesting, especially for those in the pain field, we have tried to retain a clear focus on our initial hypotheses concerning degeneracy and criticality. We hope to have struck a good balance in this revised paper."

This conclusion arises from the fact that the injected conductance needed to trigger the pathological behavior of deep tissue afferents is lower than that needed to cross the tipping point in cutaneous afferents. However, this conclusion is biased, especially in the absence of control experiments measuring the intrinsic excitability and conductance levels in native neurons. In other words, one could easily imagine that deeper tissue afferents display higher input resistance values than cutaneous afferents, and that their channel densities (in particular sodium and potassium channels) are lower than for cutaneous afferents. If this is the case, what should be compared is not the absolute conductance value that needs to be injected to trigger or reverse the pathological state, but conductance values that are adjusted for the differences in input resistance and channel densities between the two neuronal types. It is known that input resistance and channel densities are highly variable within a same cell type but also highly variable between cell types. Such differences may explain the results presented in</i> <a href=\"#fig4\"><i>Figure 4D</i></a> <i>without invoking the differences in distance between the physiological and pathological states in the two cell types analyzed.

Statistically, uninjured muscle afferents require significantly less virtual sodium conductance than cutaneous afferents to be converted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To be clear, these data are based on experiments in na\u00efve animals and show only that muscle afferents are significantly closer to their tipping point based on this one manipulation; indeed, when thinking in terms of a high-dimensional space, a system may be very close to its tipping point in one dimension but very far it in the other dimensions.

We found the current density to be significantly less in muscle afferents, which is consistent with muscle afferents operating closer to their tipping point, but again, does not exclude other differences. In any case, if the sodium channel mimicked by dynamic clamp was upregulated by nerve injury (and all other conductances remained unchanged) then a certain amount of upregulation could cause gross hyperexcitability amongst muscle afferents whilst failing to cause gross hyperexcitability amongst cutaneous afferents. We express \u201cupregulation\u201d of the virtual channel in absolute terms as there is no virtual channels in the control condition, and because we are not strictly mimicking a native Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 channel and nor could we strictly isolate the density of that channel in order to express the upregulation in relative terms."

This leads to a novel suggestion that proximity to tipping point may be a contributing factor for why certain cell types develop gross hyperexcitability after nerve injury while other cell types do not. We cannot exclude other pre-existing differences or differential injury-induced (pathological or compensatory) changes. Quantifying the contribution of each factor would be a difficult task and the interpretation of such results would be subject to many caveats. Overall, we want to introduce the distance-to-tipping-point idea, as we think it helps quantify certain demonstrations that are directly relevant to our main theses, but we think it wise to keep those demonstrations as simple as possible."

This is consistent with past publications (see response to consensus report). But we are unclear if the reviewer is questioning whether gross hyperexcitability in either type of afferent actually causes neuropathic pain. This is obviously important, but we think we are on safe ground. For instance, blocking peripheral input relieves pain for the duration of the block (e.g., Gold and Gebhart, Nat Med 2010), which argues that peripheral input is necessary to cause pain although it may not be sufficient since extensive plasticity also develops centrally. As explained in the text, myelinated afferents are believed to subserve the mechanical hypersensitivity (or allodynia) associated with neuropathic pain. A switch from onset-only spiking to repetitive spiking would dramatically amplify signaling. That said, cutaneous mechanosensors are the most likely to be directly involved, and yet neither we nor others observed gross hyperexcitability amongst those neurons. We have shown in this study that those neurons do have a critical point and that they are moved towards that critical point by nerve injury; it is conceivable that a higher proportion of cutaneous afferents cross that critical point under the conditions that exist in vivo. It is also possible that input from grossly hyperexcitable muscle afferents drives central heterosynaptic plasticity or summates with the input from cutaneous afferents (e.g., Nagi et al. J Physiol 2011) and thus contributes to mechanical allodynia in an indirect way."
