                    "text": "<i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is an obligate intracellular pathogen that resides in a membrane-bound compartment, the inclusion. The bacteria secrete a unique class of proteins, Incs, which insert into the inclusion membrane and modulate the host-bacterium interface. We previously reported that IncE binds specifically to the Sorting Nexin 5 Phox domain (SNX5-PX) and disrupts retromer trafficking. Here, we present the crystal structure of the SNX5-PX:IncE complex, showing IncE bound to a unique and highly conserved hydrophobic groove on SNX5. Mutagenesis of the SNX5-PX:IncE binding surface disrupts a previously unsuspected interaction between SNX5 and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). Addition of IncE peptide inhibits the interaction of CI-MPR with SNX5. Finally, <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection interferes with the SNX5:CI-MPR interaction, suggesting that IncE and CI-MPR are dependent on the same binding surface on SNX5. Our results provide new insights into retromer assembly and underscore the power of using pathogens to discover disease-related cell biology."

                    "text": "<i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is an obligate intracellular pathogen that resides in a membrane-bound compartment, the inclusion. The bacteria secrete a unique class of proteins, Incs, which insert into the inclusion membrane and modulate the host-bacterium interface. We previously reported that IncE binds specifically to the Sorting Nexin 5 Phox domain (SNX5-PX) and disrupts retromer trafficking. Here, we present the crystal structure of the SNX5-PX:IncE complex, showing IncE bound to a unique and highly conserved hydrophobic groove on SNX5. Mutagenesis of the SNX5-PX:IncE binding surface disrupts a previously unsuspected interaction between SNX5 and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). Addition of IncE peptide inhibits the interaction of CI-MPR with SNX5. Finally, <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection interferes with the SNX5:CI-MPR interaction, suggesting that IncE and CI-MPR are dependent on the same binding surface on SNX5. Our results provide new insights into retromer assembly and underscore the power of using pathogens to discover disease-related cell biology."

However, the <i>Chlamydia</i> factors and host cell proteins that mediate these interactions are largely unknown. Likely bacterial candidates include the inclusion membrane proteins (Incs), a group of proteins that are unique to <i>Chlamydiales</i> and that are translocated from the bacteria through the Type III secretion system (T3SS) and inserted into the inclusion membrane (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moore and Ouellette, 2014</a>). These proteins encode one or more bilobed hydrophobic domains composed of two closely spaced membrane-spanning domains,\u00a0~30 amino acids each, typically separated by a short loop region (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bannantine et al., 2000</a>). Once inserted into the inclusion membrane, the Inc N- and C-terminal domains extend into the host cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rockey et al., 2002</a>) and are thus ideally poised to modulate interactions at the host-pathogen interface."

The retromer is a phylogenetically conserved multi-subunit complex that mediates retrograde transport of transmembrane protein cargo, such as the well-studied cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), from endosomes to the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN) (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu, 2016</a>]). Retromer is composed of two distinct sub-complexes of tightly assembled subunits: a cargo recognition trimer (VPS26/29/35) and a membrane deforming heterodimer made up of sorting nexin (SNX) SNX1 or SNX2 paired with either SNX5 or SNX6. In mammals, as opposed to yeast, the association between the VPS trimer and the SNX sub-complexes is transient. The individual SNX1/2/5/6 proteins encode a Phox-homology (PX) domain that recognizes and binds to specific phosphoinositides on membranes and a Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain that both senses and induces membrane curvature. These SNX-BAR proteins facilitate formation of tubules into which the cargo receptors are sorted. We recently discovered that <i>C. trachomatis</i> IncE binds directly to the PX domains of SNX5/6 but not SNX1/2 and that IncE is sufficient to disrupt retromer-dependent trafficking of CI-MPR (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). In addition, we and others found that SNX-BAR proteins relocalize from endosomes to the inclusion membrane during <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection and that depletion of SNX5/6 enhances <i>C. trachomatis</i> replication (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aeberhard et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). Our findings suggest that IncE binding to SNX5/6 redirects SNX1/2/5/6 away from their normal functional location and thereby limits the ability of retromer to control <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). However, the molecular details by which IncE binds to the SNX5/6-PX domain are unknown; for example, does IncE binding form a novel interface, and does IncE displace a normal host binding partner? The mechanistic implications of this interaction are critical to our understanding of retromer function in pathogenesis."

We demonstrate that IncE binds to a previously unappreciated highly conserved hydrophobic groove in the SNX5-PX domain and that the binding site is distinct from the SNX5 phosphoinositide-binding site. Using quantitative AP-MS of wild type (WT) SNX5 and SNX5 mutated in key conserved residues in the hydrophobic groove, we identified an unsuspected interaction between SNX5-PX and CI-MPR. Together with direct biochemical assays and in vivo infection assays, we demonstrate that IncE disrupts the SNX5-PX:CI-MPR interaction to alter retromer-dependent trafficking. Modulation of retromer trafficking by this intracellular pathogen may facilitate its ability to survive within the hostile intracellular environment."

                                "text": "To uncover the molecular basis for the strong interaction between IncE and SNX5 and to illuminate the biological function of this interaction, we determined the crystal structure of the <i>Mus musculus</i> SNX5-PX domain (SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub>) bound to the C-terminal 25 amino acids of IncE (IncE<sub>108-132</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement at a resolution of 2.31 \u00c5, using the SNX5-PX apo-structure as a model (PDB ID 3HPC) ([<a href=\"#bib27\">Koharudin et al., 2009</a>] and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). The structure contained four copies of the SNX5-PX:IncE complex in the asymmetric unit, which are all less than 0.41 \u00c5 RMSD between the molecules and do not appear different in conformation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The discussion below refers to SNX5-PX chain A and its associated IncE (chain P) of the structure but could apply to any of the other chains. Inspection of <i>F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub></i> maps indicated strong electron density in the structure that was absent in the 3HPC model (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Using bulky hydrophobic residues as a guide, we were able to unambiguously place the IncE<sub>108-132</sub> peptide into the density, although amino acids 108\u2013110 and 132 were disordered in the crystal and could not be built. The final model of the complex (R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> 20.32/26.00) showed that IncE<sub>108-132</sub> forms a \u03b2-hairpin that does not appear to be externally stabilized by its interaction with the PX domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). When compared to the apo-SNX5-PX structure (PDB ID 3HPC [<a href=\"#bib27\">Koharudin et al., 2009</a>]), IncE<sub>108-132</sub> was found to bind in a deep, hydrophobic groove that is approximately 10 \u00c5 x 18 \u00c5 in area running perpendicular to the long axis of the SNX5-PX domain. SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> is a mixed \u03b1-\u03b2 structure with three antiparallel \u03b2-sheets running along the surface of a long \u03b1-helix (\u03b13) stabilized by two shorter helices. Two of the helices extend past the end of the \u03b2-sheets to form a long \u03b1-helical hairpin not seen in the crystal structures of other SNX-PX domains (<a href=\"#bib27\">Koharudin et al., 2009</a>). In the SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub>:IncE<sub>108-132</sub> structure, the SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> \u03b2-sheet is completed by the IncE<sub>108-132</sub> \u03b2-hairpin, which binds on the surface of the \u03b1-helical hairpin in the hydrophobic groove, hydrogen bonding with the SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> \u03b2-sheet to form a hybrid, five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Outside of this \u03b2-sheet formation, the structure of SNX5 complexed with IncE<sub>108-132</sub> is notable for its almost complete lack of hydrogen bonding or ionic charge-charge interactions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), relying instead on the formation of a small hydrophobic core at the interface of the two proteins. This core buries five residues at the interface: Y132, L133 and F136 from SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> and V114 and F116 from IncE<sub>108-132</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

For example, the SNX5 PIP binding site binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), although the binding is weak (<a href=\"#bib27\">Koharudin et al., 2009</a>). In the SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub>:IncE<sub>108-132</sub> crystal structure, we observed no direct interaction between IncE<sub>108-132</sub> and the previously observed PIP binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). In order to determine if binding of IncE altered the conformation of the SNX5-PX domain, we overlaid the apo- (PDB ID 3HPC) and IncE-bound structures and mapped RMSD values onto the surface for comparison (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The changes between the apo-SNX5-PX structure and the IncE<sub>108-132</sub> bound SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> structure are small and consist mainly of an inward rotation of the SNX5 \u03b1-helical hairpin\u00a0~30\u00b0 toward the IncE peptide. This region appears to be quite flexible as it has the highest B-factors in both the apo- and IncE-bound structures (<a href=\"#bib27\">Koharudin et al., 2009</a>). We directly tested whether IncE<sub>108-132</sub> allosterically interfered with binding of PIPs by assaying the ability of SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> to bind to immobilized phospholipids in the presence and absence of IncE<sub>108-132</sub>. IncE<sub>108-132</sub> did not compete with binding of SNX5 to lipid head groups nor did it affect the pattern of PIPs engaged by SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>).

This conservation was observed even in the most distantly related sequence we analyzed, SNX6 from <i>Trichinella spiralis</i>, which shows overall identity of only 49%. This region of conservation in the SNX5/6/32 family extends outside of the hydrophobic groove that binds to IncE and includes several solvent exposed residues, including K138 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Importantly, these residues are absent in other SNX-BAR proteins including SNX1 and SNX2, as has been previously noted (<a href=\"#bib27\">Koharudin et al., 2009</a>). Thus, the residues lining the SNX5 hydrophobic groove are not involved in the core folding of the SNX5/6/32-PX domain. These residues are solvent exposed in the unbound crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib27\">Koharudin et al., 2009</a>), and yet they are identical throughout metazoan evolution, implying an essential function. Together, our finding that the IncE binding surface is highly conserved in the SNX5/6/32 family of proteins suggests that it serves a normal physiological role, most likely by mediating an interaction with another macromolecule."

We previously demonstrated a robust recruitment of full-length FLAG-SNX5<sub>WT</sub> to the <i>C. trachomatis</i> inclusion and associated tubules (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>).

Thus, we hypothesized that mutating this surface would lead to loss of the native interaction. We performed AP-MS to identify host cell proteins whose binding to SNX5 is dependent on the presence of the same hydrophobic residues, Y132 and F136, as are required for IncE binding. Full-length FLAG-SNX5<sub>WT</sub>, FLAG-SNX5<sub>Y132D</sub> or FLAG-SNX5<sub>F136D</sub> were transfected into HEK293T cells. Affinity-purified eluates were analyzed by label-free, shotgun liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), employing a pipeline similar to our previous studies (<a href=\"#bib26\">J\u00e4ger et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Using SAINT-Express (<a href=\"#bib51\">Teo et al., 2014</a>), we compared the protein-protein interactions of affinity purified lysates from untransfected cells to those prepared from SNX5<sub>WT</sub>, SNX5<sub>Y132D</sub>, or SNX5<sub>F136D</sub> transfected cells. We considered only those proteins that had a Bayesian False Discovery rate (BFDR) \u2264\u00a00.1, a conservative threshold for the elimination of false positive interactions. Although six proteins were found to significantly interact with SNX5<sub>WT</sub> protein according to the SAINT algorithm, only two proteins, CI-MPR and Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF1R), bound differentially to SNX5<sub>WT</sub> and the SNX5 hydrophobic groove mutants, as evidenced by significantly different SAINT scores (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We focused on CI-MPR because it is the most well studied retromer cargo and because we have previously established that ectopic expression of IncE is sufficient to disrupt CI-MPR trafficking (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, SNX1 co-affinity purified with both WT and mutant SNX5 (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), consistent with the notion that disrupting the IncE binding surface does not cause major alterations to the SNX5 structure. This result also suggests that the association of CI-MPR with SNX5 observed in the AP-MS analysis is not solely dependent on the previously described interaction of SNX1/2 with the VPS complex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Haft et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rojas et al., 2007</a>)."

As we have previously reported (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>), IncE co-immunoprecipitates with FLAG-SNX5 in infected cells, and infection does not appreciably diminish steady-state levels of SNX1, VPS35, or CI-MPR.

Remarkably, infection decreased the co-immunoprecipitation of CI-MPR with FLAG-SNX5 with minimal effects on the co-immunoprecipitation of SNX1 with FLAG-SNX5. We quantified the effect of infection on co-immunoprecipitation of CI-MPR with SNX5 by calculating the ratio of CI-MPR in infected versus uninfected FLAG-SNX5 transfected lysates and the ratio of CI-MPR in infected versus uninfected FLAG-SNX5 co-immunoprecipitations. We found an\u00a0~5.6 fold decrease in the ratio in co-immunoprecipitated complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

We have previously shown that the C-terminus of IncE binds directly to the PX domain of the retromer components SNX5 and SNX6, but fails to bind to the closely related SNX1-PX and SNX2-PX domains (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). By solving the crystal structure of the IncE-C-terminus in complex with the SNX5-PX domain, we demonstrate that IncE binds to a hydrophobic groove that is highly conserved among SNX5/6/32 homologs but absent in SNX1/2 homologs, thus explaining the exquisite specificity of the IncE:SNX interaction. The high conservation of this SNX5/6/32 hydrophobic groove further suggests that IncE may be displacing or mimicking a host binding partner that is essential for host function. We therefore employed an unbiased quantitative AP-MS approach to identify host proteins whose interaction with SNX5-containing complexes was dependent upon an intact IncE binding surface. Unexpectedly, this analysis identified the CI-MPR, the most well-characterized transmembrane receptor sorted by the mammalian retromer. We confirmed in vivo that CI-MPR co-immunoprecipitates with ectopically-produced SNX5 and that co-immunoprecipitation is diminished in the IncE binding surface mutants. An IncE peptide corresponding to residues 108\u2013132 inhibited binding of the CI-MPR to affinity-purified SNX5-containing complexes, whereas a mutant peptide altered in the predicted SNX5 binding residues was without effect. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection disrupts the association of CI-MPR with SNX5-associated complexes and that the SNX5 hydrophobic groove is required for its interaction with the inclusion. We conclude that the highly conserved IncE binding surface on SNX5 is required for its interaction with the CI-MPR. Based on our results, we favor the hypothesis that during <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection, inclusion-localized IncE displaces a lower affinity SNX5:CI-MPR interaction. From these studies, we can mechanistically link IncE to <i>Chlamydia-</i>mediated disruption of retromer trafficking, and thereby illuminate a new mechanism by which a vacuolar pathogen avoids retromer-mediated restriction of its intracellular developmental cycle."

Prior to solving the co-crystal structure, we predicted that IncE binding to SNX5 would affect the interaction of SNX5 with its known binding partners, SNX1/2 BAR domains or phosphoinositides (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cullen and Carlton, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seaman, 2012</a>). However, our structure revealed no major conformational changes in the PX domain or the BAR domain-interacting surface. This finding is consistent with our observation that IncE peptide does not interfere with SNX5 binding to immobilized phospholipids or to SNX1. Our studies thus identify a previously unrecognized and functionally important surface of SNX5 that may provide an additional level of cargo specificity during retrieval of CI-MPR (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu, 2016</a>)."

Alternatively, retromer cargo binding to SNX5 may be indirect, mediated by one or more additional protein(s). Finally, the hydrophobic binding groove could contribute to SNX5 association with membranes that contain the CI-MPR, leading to co-purification of the two proteins.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Human Papilloma Virus, <i>Coxiella burnetii,</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> require retromer function for efficient intracellular survival (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bujny et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Groppelli et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lipovsky et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McDonough et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Personnic et al., 2016</a>). In contrast, <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> infection inhibits retromer function through a secreted effector, RidL, which binds to VPS29 and PI(3)P (<a href=\"#bib18\">Finsel et al., 2013</a>). Our results provide important mechanistic insights as to how <i>Chlamydia</i> interferes with host cell trafficking pathways and provide possible explanations for the intriguing result that depletion of SNX5/6 during <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection leads to increased infectious progeny (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aeberhard et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</a>). CI-MPR plays a role inlysosomal function by virtue of its ability to transport newly synthesized acid hydrolase precursors from the TGN to endosomes for eventual delivery to lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bonifacino and Hurley, 2008</a>). RNAi-mediated depletion of retromer components prevents retrieval of acid hydrolase receptors to the TGN and results in their missorting to lysosomes and eventual degradation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arighi et al., 2004</a>). Mislocalization of CI-MPR also causes mistrafficking of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C2 Protein (NPC2), resulting in cholesterol accumulation in the late endosomes and lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marquer et al., 2016</a>). During <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection, disruption of CI-MPR association with SNX5 may perturb retromer-dependent receptor recycling, which could disrupt lysosomal function (<a href=\"#bib41\">Riederer et al., 1994</a>). The role of lysosomes in <i>Chlamydia</i> infection remains incompletely understood; <i>Chlamydia</i> avoids fusion with lysosomes but may utilize them as a source of nutrients (<a href=\"#bib3\">Al-Younes et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Heinzen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ouellette et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rzomp et al., 2003</a>). Alternatively, since <i>Chlamydia</i> acquires cholesterol from the host and since the <i>Chlamydia</i> inclusion maintains an intimate association with late endosomal and lysosomal compartments where cholesterol accumulates (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carabeo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Elwell et al., 2016</a>), retromer dysfunction could enhance cholesterol transport to the inclusion. Altogether, our structural studies of IncE binding to the SNX5-PX domain reveal a highly conserved hydrophobic groove on SNX5 that is required for the interaction of the CI-MPR with retromer, a process that can be targeted by pathogens to avoid retromer-mediated host restriction of vacuolar pathogens."

The protein was passed twice over Ni agarose resin (Gold Biotechnology) to remove the protease and purification tag, concentrated and injected onto a Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP (buffer G). SNX5-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 31.2 mg/ml. The IncE (UniProt P0DJI4) peptide encompassing residues 108\u2013132 was synthesized by Peptide 2.0 at 90.44% purity and diluted in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP to 3.94 mM. For complex formation, IncE<sub>108-132</sub> was mixed with purified SNX5-PX<sub>20-180</sub> at a 3.4:1 (mol/mol) ratio and injected onto a Superdex 75 10/300 size exclusion column equilibrated in buffer G.

In proteomic screens, the authors of this study have previously found that the C-terminal portion of IncE interacts with the PX domain of SNX5, leading to missorting of retromer. In the current study, they report the crystal structure of the IncE-SNX5 complex. IncE forms an antiparallel hairpin structure that binds as an extension of the SNX5-PX domain \u03b2-sheet. The authors confirm their structure by mutagenesis and pull-down experiments. They find that the IncE interaction site in the SNX5-PX domain is evolutionary highly conserved, suggesting a conserved cellular function. Using mass spectrometry, they identify the known retromer cargo cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) as binding partner of the SNX5 PX domain. They then show that addition of an IncE peptide, but not of an IncE variant peptide with mutations in the PX domain binding interaction site, disturbs the SNX5-CI-MPR interaction in cell lysates. In the final experiment, they demonstrate that Chlamydia infection interferes with binding of CI-MPR to SNX5."

However, the story would be significantly enhanced by extending the structural and mass spectrometry analyses to better characterize the interaction of Cl<sup>-</sup>MPR with IncE. Given that the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain is only 163 residues, it should not require much work to synthesize peptides covering that region to determine which residues bind to SNX5, to complete this satisfying and high quality story."

These data are consistent with our earlier finding that overexpression of IncE and subsequent binding of SNX5/6 disrupts normal trafficking of CI-MPR. As the reviewers rightly indicated, our findings do not prove the interaction between CI-MPR and SNX5 is direct. This point is especially important because CI-MPR has been demonstrated to interact with VPS35, another component of the retromer. A direct interaction of CI-MPR and VPS35 has been demonstrated by yeast two hybrid studies. Since SNX5/6 is in the cytosol, we assume that any interaction between SNX5/6, either direct or indirect, would be mediated by the cytosolically exposed C-terminal region of CI-MPR. We have pursed several methods to purify the C-terminus of CI-MPR for use in direct <i>in vitro</i> binding studies. First, we purified CI-MPR fused to maltose binding protein (MBP) but unfortunately this construct yielded protein that was likely insoluble and/or improperly folded, making it impossible to interpret binding studies. We then purified CI-MPR fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST), but the yields were low and highly contaminated with free GST from cleavage events. In general, we had significant issues with proteolysis of the CI-MPR."

Therefore, we took a subtractive approach that did not rely on washing. This also was not successful, despite extensive trouble- shooting. Next, we further purified away as much free GST as possible and bound the GST-CI-MPR to the sensor tip on an Octet. Again, we observed substantial non-specific binding, even in the presence of BSA and detergent.
