Here we find, unexpectedly, that undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) contain only six TAFs (TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11), whereas following differentiation all TAFs are expressed. Directed and global chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal an unprecedented promoter occupancy pattern: most active genes are bound by only TAFs 3 and 5 along with TBP, whereas the remaining active genes are bound by TBP and all six hESC TAFs. Consistent with these results, hESCs contain a previously undescribed complex comprising TAFs 2, 6, 7, 11 and TBP. Altering the composition of hESC TAFs, either by depleting TAFs that are present or ectopically expressing TAFs that are absent, results in misregulated expression of pluripotency genes and induction of differentiation. Thus, the selective expression and use of TAFs underlies the ability of hESCs to self-renew."

Here we find, unexpectedly, that undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) contain only six TAFs (TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11), whereas following differentiation all TAFs are expressed. Directed and global chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal an unprecedented promoter occupancy pattern: most active genes are bound by only TAFs 3 and 5 along with TBP, whereas the remaining active genes are bound by TBP and all six hESC TAFs. Consistent with these results, hESCs contain a previously undescribed complex comprising TAFs 2, 6, 7, 11 and TBP. Altering the composition of hESC TAFs, either by depleting TAFs that are present or ectopically expressing TAFs that are absent, results in misregulated expression of pluripotency genes and induction of differentiation. Thus, the selective expression and use of TAFs underlies the ability of hESCs to self-renew."

Different genes code for the various proteins associated with these two properties, and understanding the behaviour and properties of stem cells in detail is a major challenge in developmental biology. In human embryonic stem cells that have not yet differentiated, the genes that code for the transcription factors involved in the self-renewal process are expressed, whereas the genes associated with differentiation are not active. However, if the expression of the genes for self-renewal is reduced, the process of differentiation will begin, and the embryonic stem cells will be able to produce any one of the 200 or so different types of cell found in the human body."

The factors involved in the accurate transcription of eukaryotic structural genes by RNA polymerase II can be classified into two groups. First, general (or basic) transcription factors (GTFs) are necessary and can be sufficient for accurate transcription initiation in vitro (for review, see <a href=\"#bib41\">Thomas and Chiang, 2006</a>). These basic factors include RNA polymerase II itself and at least six GTFs: TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH. The GTFs assemble on the core promoter in an ordered fashion to form a pre-initiation complex (PIC)."

In undifferentiated hESCs, pluripotency genes such as <i>OCT4</i> (also called <i>POU5F1</i>), <i>NANOG</i> and <i>SOX2</i> are expressed, whereas genes involved in differentiation are transcriptionally inactive (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib39\">Sun et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pan and Thomson, 2007</a>).

To investigate this possibility, we analyzed expression of 13 TAFs by immunoblotting lysates from H9 cells, a well-characterized hESC line. As a control, we also analyzed TAF expression in HeLa cells, which have been extensively used to study TFIID composition and function. The immunoblot of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> shows, as expected, that all 13 TAFs were expressed in HeLa cells. By contrast, hESCs clearly expressed TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11, whereas expression of TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13 was undetectable. Interestingly, TAF6 is expressed in both cell types, but the isoform present in H9 cells is predominantly the short delta form, whereas in HeLa cells, the major TAF6 isoform is the larger, alpha/beta form. The specificity of each TAF antibody was confirmed by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). We observed a similar TAF expression pattern in a second hESC line, H1 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis comparing <i>TAF</i> mRNA levels in HeLa and H9 cells correlated with the immunoblotting results (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Unlike the TAFs, all other GTFs analyzed were comparably expressed in HeLa and H9 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Based upon these results we conclude that only six of the canonical TFIID TAFs are present in hESCs."

To investigate this issue, we performed a series of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. In the first set of experiments we selected 10 transcriptionally active genes and performed ChIP analysis to monitor promoter occupancy by the six hESC TAFs. As a normalization standard, we also monitored occupancy of TBP and RNA polymerase II large subunit (POL2) on these 10 promoters. As expected, we found that TBP and POL2 were present at comparable levels at each of the 10 promoters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However, the absolute level of TBP and POL2 bound to each promoter significantly varied among the 10 genes. Therefore, in this experiment and those presented below, TAF recruitment was normalized to the level of TBP occupancy. The ChIP results of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> revealed two groups of genes with distinct TAF promoter occupancy patterns. The first group, which we refer to as class I genes, were bound by TAFs 3 and 5 but not by TAFs 2, 6, 7 and 11, whereas the second group, class II genes, were bound by all six hESC TAFs."

In these experiments we monitored, in parallel, promoter occupancy of TAFs 3 and 5, TAFs 7 and 11 (as representative members of the TBP/TAF 2,6,7,11 complex), TBP and POL2. The overall results are summarized in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. We first defined a group of \u223c3600 high-confidence actively transcribed genes based upon co-occupancy of both TBP and POL2 at the transcription start-site (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>). The vast majority of active genes had promoter-bound TAF3 and TAF5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Significantly, a smaller fraction of active genes had promoter-bound TAF7 or TAF11, and there was substantial overlap between TAF7- and TAF11-bound genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). As expected, the vast majority of genes bound by TAFs 7 and 11 were also bound by TAFs 3 and 5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Representative examples of promoter occupancy maps for two class I (<i>SLC25A3</i>, <i>CCNB2</i>) and class II (<i>SFPQ</i>, <i>UCHL1</i>) genes are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>."

To confirm this conclusion, we also tested whether knocking down hESC TAFs would induce differentiation by analyzing expression of a diverse set of differentiation markers: AFP (endoderm), CGB7 (trophoectoderm), IGF2 (mesoderm), NES (ectoderm) and SOX1 (neuroectoderm). <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> shows that depletion of each hESC TAF resulted in up-regulation, to varying extents, of these differentiation markers.

By contrast, ectopic expression of TBP or TAFs that are present in hESCs did not affect OCT4 levels. To investigate the basis for the decreased <i>OCT4</i> expression, we performed ChIP analysis. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a> shows that, following ectopic expression of TAF1, TBP and POL2 were no longer recruited to the <i>OCT4</i> promoter.

However, if H9 cells do contain low levels of TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 our biochemical experiments indicate that they are below that required to stably associate with TBP and the TAFs that are detectably present in H9 cells to form the much larger TFIID complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In addition, we could not detect significant binding of TAFs 1, 8 and 9 on the promoters of seven transcriptionally active genes in H9 cells in a ChIP assay, although binding was readily detected on the same promoters in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, our conclusion that H9 cells contain no (or very low levels of) TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 is based not only on expression data but also on biochemical results and promoter binding experiments."

These nine TAFs can form five specific heterodimers: TAF3\u201310, TAF6\u20139, TAF4\u201312, TAF8\u201310 and TAF11\u201313. Several of these heterodimers are thought to be important for the assembly and structure of TFIID. hESCs contain only three HFD-containing TAFs (3, 6 and 11), which cannot form any of the five known heterodimers.

In this regard, TAF2 and TAF6 have been shown to interact with promoter sequence elements (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib28\">Maston et al., 2006</a>), which may contribute to differential promoter recognition by the TBP/TAF 2,6,7,11 complex.

The core promoter sequence is identical in every cell, raising the possibility that in hESCs differences in activators or epigenetic signatures may be coordinated with the alterations in core promoter complexes. For example, in the myogenic program, core promoter recognition complex changes correlates with the presence of developmentally regulated activators (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deato et al., 2008</a>)."

Thus, the unusual composition of TAFs described here is required for the ability of hESCs to properly regulate gene expression, maintain an undifferentiated state, and self-renew. This conclusion is reinforced by the finding that the TAFs that are absent from undifferentiated hESCs are expressed following differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The transcriptional induction of several differentiation markers, which are not normally expressed in hESCs, following knockdown of an hESC TAF can be explained either by the dispensability of the TAF for transcription of the marker, or incomplete knockdown enabling transcription to occur at reduced TAF levels."

These and other findings have prompted speculation that during differentiation the canonical TFIID complex becomes progressively specialized (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib7\">D'Alessio et al., 2009</a>). However our results reveal a more complex model. Rather than starting from a complete, canonical TFIID and progressing to more restricted forms, undifferentiated hESCs start with a specialized, highly unique general transcription machinery, then switch to a period of complete TFIID before specialization of the transcription machinery again in some terminal differentiation programs. Collectively, these findings suggest that altering the composition of the basic transcription machinery in general and TAFs specifically may be a particularly powerful mechanism for developmental reprogramming."

The conventional/canonical TFIID complex comprises TBP and about 14 TAF subunits. In this work, it was found that TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 11 - but not TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13 - are expressed in hESCs, and that TAFs 2, 6, 7, and 11 appear to form a novel complex with TBP. By ChIP analysis, two classes of transcriptionally active genes were identified in hESCs. Class I genes are regulated by TAFs 3 and 5, whereas Class II genes are regulated by all six TAFs in hESCs. RNAi depletion of TAF 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, or 11 as well as overexpression of TAF1 caused a decrease in pluripotency. These findings suggest that the proper regulation of TAFs is important for the maintenance of hESCs."

Notably, these studies have been carried out in a wide range of eukaryotes including yeast, Drosophila S2 cells and mammalian cells. The results of these studies have clearly demonstrated that when a TAF is required for transcription of a gene, loss-of-function of that TAF (resulting from mutational inactivation, RNA interference-mediated depletion or decreased expression) results in diminished transcription that is accompanied by decreased RNA polymerase II occupancy in a chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Representative examples of such studies include those performed in yeast (Shen et al. 2003, <i>EMBO J</i>. 22:3395; Sharma et al. 2003, <i>Genes Dev</i>. 17:502), Drosophila S2 cells (Vorobyeva et al. 2009, <i>PNAS</i> 106:11049) and mammalian cells (Deato and Tjian 2007, <i>Genes Dev</i>. 21:2137; Zaborowska et al. 2012, <i>Transcription</i> 3:92). In addition to these in vivo examples, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a role for TAFs in RNA polymerase II recruitment (see, for examples, Wu and Chiang 2001, <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>. 276:34235; Felinski and Quinn 2001, <i>PNAS</i> 98:13078)."

We believe that when these results are completed they may provide insights into the roles of specific TAFs in transcription of class I and class II genes and shed light on the differences between class I and class II promoters. However, our preliminary results indicate that the requirement of specific TAFs for recruitment of other TAFs and TBP is complex, differs among the TAFs, and may also differ between promoters of the same class. Therefore, until we have performed a comprehensive analysis, which will require considerably more experimentation and time and may necessitate genome-wide studies, we think it would premature to publish a limited set of results, which could be potentially non-representative and misleading."
