Some regulate their active counterparts but the structural principles of this regulation remain largely unknown. We report X-ray structures of <i>Trypanosoma brucei S</i>-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase alone and in functional complex with its catalytically dead paralogous partner, prozyme. We show monomeric <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC is inactive because of autoinhibition by its N-terminal sequence. Heterodimerization with prozyme displaces this sequence from the active site through a complex mechanism involving a <i>cis</i>-to-<i>trans</i> proline isomerization, reorganization of a \u03b2-sheet, and insertion of the N-terminal \u03b1-helix into the heterodimer interface, leading to enzyme activation.  We propose that evolution of this intricate regulatory mechanism was facilitated by acquisition of the dimerization domain, a single step that can in principle account for the divergence of regulatory schemes in the AdoMetDC enzyme family. These studies elucidate an allosteric mechanism in an enzyme and a plausible scheme by which such complex cooperativity evolved."
