Transcription factors typically engage in complex interaction networks, likely masking the effects of specifically inhibiting single protein-protein interactions. Here, we used a combination of genomic, proteomic and biophysical methods to discover a suite of protein-protein interactions involving the SOX18 transcription factor, a known regulator of vascular development and disease. We describe a small-molecule that is able to disrupt a discrete subset of SOX18-dependent interactions. This compound selectively suppressed SOX18 transcriptional outputs in vitro and interfered with vascular development in zebrafish larvae. In a mouse pre-clinical model of breast cancer, treatment with this inhibitor significantly improved survival by reducing tumour vascular density and metastatic spread. Our studies validate an interactome-based molecular strategy to interfere with transcription factor activity, for the development of novel disease therapeutics."

Transcription factors typically engage in complex interaction networks, likely masking the effects of specifically inhibiting single protein-protein interactions. Here, we used a combination of genomic, proteomic and biophysical methods to discover a suite of protein-protein interactions involving the SOX18 transcription factor, a known regulator of vascular development and disease. We describe a small-molecule that is able to disrupt a discrete subset of SOX18-dependent interactions. This compound selectively suppressed SOX18 transcriptional outputs in vitro and interfered with vascular development in zebrafish larvae. In a mouse pre-clinical model of breast cancer, treatment with this inhibitor significantly improved survival by reducing tumour vascular density and metastatic spread. Our studies validate an interactome-based molecular strategy to interfere with transcription factor activity, for the development of novel disease therapeutics."

We further found that all three SOXF proteins can form a heterodimer with OCT4, whereas only the SOX17-OCT4 interaction is affected by <b>Sm4</b>.

These results are an indirect indication that the <b>Sm4</b> affected genes are dysregulated through a specific effect on SOX18 transcriptional activity. This correlation was not observed for 7 of the other transcription factors tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1c</a>), signifying that <b>Sm4</b> does not have an off-target effect on these TFs activity.

Although only mildly significant, this could suggest possible co-regulation by SOX18 and c-JUN on this subset of <b>Sm4</b> down-regulated genes. Indeed, analysis of known motifs in SOX18 ChIP-seq peaks revealed an over-representation of c-JUN binding motifs (3.23% of SOX18 peaks, p-value=1e-302) and ALPHA-Screen analysis further established that SOX18 and c-JUN could physically interact (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Combined genetic interference with <i>sox7, sox18</i> and <i>rbpj</i> has been shown to abolish <i>Dll4in3</i> activation, while single or double MO knockdowns have a much milder effect (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sacilotto et al., 2013</a>).

In addition, when <i>rbpj</i> MO injections at suboptimal dose were combined with <b>Sm4</b> treatment, the repressive effect was significantly increased by 11.5% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>).

Conventional approaches to target transcription factors have focused on interfering with oncogenes that are dysregulated to promote tumor cell transformation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gormally et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Illendula et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Moellering et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Here, we validate a novel complementary strategy that relies on targeting a developmental transcription factor from the host vasculature that can facilitate metastatic spread. Our results provide a proof of concept that targeting the transcription factor SOX18 with <b>Sm4</b> is an effective molecular strategy to interfere with the metastatic spread in a pre-clinical model of breast cancer."

Tumor size was measured with a digital caliper as the product of two perpendicular diameters. Blood plasma was collected from mice on day 7 and 12, and <b>Sm4</b> concentrations were analyzed using a 4000 Qtrap LC-MS/MS system mass spectrometer. On day 12, mice were anesthetised to surgically remove primary tumor, or mice were put through surgery procedure with no excision of the primary tumor, and the wound was closed with surgical clips. Tumors were collected in formalin for histology. Lungs were harvested on day 28 and fixed in Bouin\u2019s solution for 24 hr and metastatic tumor nodules were counted under a dissection microscope. Survival of the mice was monitored in experiments where the lungs were not harvested. Groups of 6 to 14 mice per experiment were used for experimental tumor assays, to ensure adequate power to detect biological differences. All experiments were approved by the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Animal Ethics Committee (P1505)."

Given that the <i>Dll4int3</i> reporter does not contain all regulatory elements of the endogenous <i>Dll4</i> gene, it could be that SM4 is more effective against the reporter and other elements still drive endogenous <i>Dll4</i>. As you currently don't comment on the discrepancy in the text, it is difficult for us to recommend precisely how you should address this issue. We suggest to carefully compare the response of endogenous <i>Dll4</i> expression similarly to the dose response you find for the <i>Dll4</i> reporter. Given the dynamic nature of <i>Dll4</i> expression, it could also be a timing issue, and thus related to the half-life of the drug? A possible experiment in vivo could be to show in situ hybridisation for <i>Dll4</i> in WT fish treated with SM4. As <i>Dll4</i> levels have a major impact on blood vessel formation also in tumour angiogenesis, and your in vivo mouse experiments show effects on tumour angiogenesis, we feel this needs to be clear in order to understand the action of SM4. This should be possible to address in two months. In case experimental data do not provide a clear answer, please address this issue carefully in text and Discussion."

They start from an elegant experiment of ChIP-MS to isolate nuclear factors interacting with SOX18 presumably on chromatin. They test also interaction of SOX18 with several transcription factors obtained from the ChIP-MS to validate the protein-protein interaction and also to measure the effect of a small molecule sm4, describe in another manuscript, on these interactions.

However, there is a possibility that Sm4 can inhibit tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth by affecting molecules other than Sox18. This possibility could be tested by administering Sm4 to Sox18-knockout mice bearing tumors, since the effect of Sm4 on Sox18 will be abolished in this mouse model."
