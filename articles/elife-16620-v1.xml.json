                    "text": "BubR1 is a key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Mutations that reduce BubR1 abundance cause aneuploidization and tumorigenesis in humans and mice, whereas BubR1 overexpression protects against these. However, how supranormal BubR1 expression exerts these beneficial physiological impacts is poorly understood. Here, we used <i>Bub1b</i> mutant transgenic mice to explore the role of the amino-terminal (BubR1<sup>N</sup>) and internal (BubR1<sup>I</sup>) Cdc20-binding domains of BubR1 in preventing aneuploidy and safeguarding against cancer. BubR1<sup>N</sup> was necessary, but not sufficient to protect against aneuploidy and cancer. In contrast, BubR1 lacking the internal Cdc20-binding domain provided protection against both, which coincided with improved microtubule-kinetochore attachment error correction and SAC activity. Maximal SAC reinforcement occurred when both the Phe- and D-box of BubR1<sup>I</sup> were disrupted. Thus, while under- or overexpression of most mitotic regulators impairs chromosome segregation fidelity, certain manipulations of BubR1 can positively impact this process and therefore be therapeutically exploited."

Mutations that reduce BubR1 abundance cause aneuploidization and tumorigenesis in humans and mice, whereas BubR1 overexpression protects against these. However, how supranormal BubR1 expression exerts these beneficial physiological impacts is poorly understood. Here, we used <i>Bub1b</i> mutant transgenic mice to explore the role of the amino-terminal (BubR1<sup>N</sup>) and internal (BubR1<sup>I</sup>) Cdc20-binding domains of BubR1 in preventing aneuploidy and safeguarding against cancer. BubR1<sup>N</sup> was necessary, but not sufficient to protect against aneuploidy and cancer. In contrast, BubR1 lacking the internal Cdc20-binding domain provided protection against both, which coincided with improved microtubule-kinetochore attachment error correction and SAC activity. Maximal SAC reinforcement occurred when both the Phe- and D-box of BubR1<sup>I</sup> were disrupted. Thus, while under- or overexpression of most mitotic regulators impairs chromosome segregation fidelity, certain manipulations of BubR1 can positively impact this process and therefore be therapeutically exploited."

Additional experiments performed on mouse cells grown in the laboratory revealed that whole BubR1 protein and the mutant protein lacking the middle region might prevent aneuploidy in multiple ways. For example, both systems had stronger SAC signaling, which could serve to make segregating the chromosomes more accurate."

Aneuploidy, defined as a state in which there are alterations to whole chromosome copy number, results from CIN and is a feature of almost all tumors, but whether aneuploidy is a cause or consequence of transformation is the subject of much debate (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ricke and van Deursen, 2013</a>). CIN is thought to allow pre-neoplastic cells to acquire genes that promote tumor progression and lose those which suppress transformation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burrell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Loeb, 2011</a>) and there are multiple lines of evidence which support aneuploidy having a causative role for cancer. For instance, several human aneuploidy syndromes are characterized by increased susceptibility to cancer, including trisomies 8, 18 (Edwards syndrome) and 21 (Down Syndrome) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ganmore et al., 2009</a>), and mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hanks et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Snape et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, bidirectional deviations in protein levels of various mitotic regulators, including Mad2, Mad1 and Bub1, cause aneuploidy and tumor predisposition in mice (<a href=\"#bib30\">Iwanaga et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jeganathan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Michel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ricke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ryan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sotillo et al., 2007</a>). Additionally, modulations to a spectrum of other proteins that participate in diverse cellular functions, such as the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubch10 (<a href=\"#bib72\">van Ree et al., 2010</a>), the centromere-linked microtubule protein CENP-E (<a href=\"#bib75\">Weaver et al., 2007</a>), and the nuclear pore complex protein Nup88 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Naylor et al., 2016</a>) result in aneuploidy and accelerated cancer progression. Finally, genome-wide screens of proteins that negatively (STOP) and positively (GO) regulate proliferation are recurrently and selectively lost and gained respectively in either focal regions or whole chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Davoli et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Solimini et al., 2012</a>). This suggests a model where changes in gene copy number are under selection rather than simply accompanying transformation, supporting genomic instability as a driver of cancer (<a href=\"#bib13\">Davoli et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Solimini et al., 2012</a>). On the other hand, several other mouse models of CIN have revealed inconsistent results regarding the relationship between aneuploidy and cancer, where some mouse models with elevated levels of aneuploidy do not show increased susceptibility to cancer (<a href=\"#bib1\">Babu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kalitsis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ricke et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, proteotoxic stress from increased gene expression in cells with extra chromosome copies has adverse effects on cell growth and may thus counteract cancer progression (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Williams et al., 2008</a>)."

To promote high-fidelity separation of duplicated chromosomes, cells have the\u00a0machinery to safeguard against missegregation. One such mechanism is the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). This surveillance system prevents activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) by its co-activator, Cdc20 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Peters, 2006</a>). This ensures chromosomal stability by preventing sister chromatid separation prior to bi-orientation of mitotic chromosomes at the metaphase plate (<a href=\"#bib53\">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</a>). An additional measure to promote accurate chromosome segregation is allowing sufficient time to form proper and correct erroneous kinetochore-microtubule (MT-KT) attachments prior to anaphase onset (<a href=\"#bib51\">Meraldi et al., 2004</a>). Merotely, a type of improper attachment in which a single kinetochore is attached to microtubules emanating from both spindle poles, is undetected by the SAC and can result in lagging chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cimini et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rodriguez-Bravo et al., 2014</a>). Mad1/2, Mps1, and BubR1 specify the minimum time in mitosis, and loss of these proteins reduces the duration of mitosis and increases the rates of missegregation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maciejowski et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Meraldi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rodriguez-Bravo et al., 2014</a>)."

Once each chromosome has properly and stably attached to the mitotic spindle and sufficient inter-kinetochore tension is generated, the MCC dissociates, allowing Cdc20 to activate the APC/C (<a href=\"#bib53\">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</a>). Co-activation of APC/C by Cdc20 in metaphase results in the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of cyclin B1 and securin, thereby triggering sister chromatid separation and anaphase onset (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kapanidou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</a>). BubR1, encoded by the gene <i>Bub1b</i> in mice or <i>BUB1B</i> in humans, is a modular protein, with several known functional domains that together ensure mitotic fidelity and genome stability. BubR1 localizes to the kinetochore by interacting through its GLEBs-like motif with Bub3 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Elowe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</a>). In human cells, kinetochore-localized BubR1 was shown to be important for MT-KT stabilization through an internally located kinetochore attachment and regulatory domain (KARD) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</a>). The KARD allows kinetochore localization of the phosphatase PP2A, which counteracts the MT-KT destabilizing activity of Aurora B kinase, a key mediator of error-correction (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ruchaud et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</a>). Additional BubR1 functional domains include a putative kinase/pseudokinase domain that has been reported to reinforce the SAC and stabilize MT-KT attachments (<a href=\"#bib18\">Elowe, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</a>) and two Cdc20-binding domains, of which the N-terminal domain (BubR1<sup>N</sup>) is a critical APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibitor essential for cell survival (<a href=\"#bib47\">Malureanu et al., 2009</a>). BubR1<sup>N</sup> contains two KEN-boxes, spanning amino acids 19\u201321 (KEN1) and 298\u2013300 (KEN2) in mice, that in conjunction with a destruction (D)-box (D1) just downstream of KEN2 permits BubR1 to behave as a pseudo-substrate inhibitor of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>(<a href=\"#bib9\">Burton and Solomon, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Han et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Izawa and Pines, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Malureanu et al., 2009</a>). Recent work has highlighted that BubR1 is capable of binding both soluble Cdc20 through KEN1 to prevent APC/C-Cdc20 association, and a second Cdc20 that has already bound to and activated the APC/C through a combination of KEN2 and D1 for even more dynamic APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition (<a href=\"#bib31\">Izawa and Pines, 2015</a>)."

We show that overexpression of a mutant BubR1 that includes disruptions of the internal Cdc20-binding domain (BubR1<sup>\u2206I</sup>) elicits a tumor-protective mechanism similar to that of full-length (FL)-BubR1 overexpression. Importantly, like in FL-<i>Bub1b</i>, overexpression of this mutant also safeguards against aneuploidization, likely by both strengthening SAC signaling and preventing improper KT-MT attachments. Thus, the internal Cdc20-binding domain is dispensable to mediate these protective effects, while the N-terminal Cdc20-binding domain is necessary, but not sufficient. BubR1<sup>\u2206I</sup> also provides distinct molecular properties unique to that of overexpression alone that also likely promote genetic stability and show no overt detrimental effects on cells or mice. This includes a more robust SAC that is more responsive to weak stimuli, and an increase in the normal length of mitosis. With further refined mutant <i>Bub1b</i> constructs, we demonstrate that a maximal SAC response can be achieved exclusively by the loss of the Phe box and D-box2, and that the mitotic timing may be dependent on previously uncharacterized regions of BubR1. Importantly, this work sheds light on the causal role of CIN in cancer by demonstrating that enhancing genomic stability fortifies the barriers of transformation, and may provide unique insights into the generation of new therapeutic strategies."

The first two mutants lacked either residues 1\u2013363 containing the N-terminal Cdc20-binding domain (<i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394N</sup>) or residues 525\u2013700 (<i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup>) which disrupts the Phe box, and removes D-box2 and KARD. The third mutant contained only the N-terminal Cdc20-binding domain (<i>Bub1b</i><sup>N</sup>). Like FL-<i>Bub1b</i>, all three mutants were expressed under the control of the ubiquitously active CAAGS promoter (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2013</a>). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was co-expressed from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Western blots of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and lung tissue from 5-month old mice revealed that each of the three BubR1 mutants was expressed at levels comparable to that of FL-BubR1 (strain T23; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To examine whether the <i>Bub1b</i> mutants we created negatively impacted karyotype integrity, we performed chromosome counts on metaphase spreads of MEFs derived from wild-type and <i>Bub1b</i> transgenic MEFs (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). There was no significant difference in aneuploidy rates between FL-<i>Bub1b</i>, <i>Bub1b</i><sup>N</sup>, <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> and wild-type MEFs, whereas <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394N</sup> MEFs had increased aneuploidy. However, these aneuploidy-prone MEFs did not have higher rates of chromosome segregation errors as assessed by live cell imaging (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). As expected, missegregation rates for the FL-<i>Bub1b</i>, <i>Bub1b</i><sup>N</sup>, and <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup>\u00a0mutants were normal. By interphase FISH, none of the transgenic mouse lines, including <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394N</sup>, showed evidence of elevated aneuploidy rates in a broad spectrum of mouse tissues and organs collected from 5-month-old mice (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>).

Given the robustness of this tumor protection, we used <i>Kras</i><sup>LA1</sup> mice to explore the role of the amino-terminal and internal Cdc20-binding domains in the tumor protective effect of BubR1 overexpression on cancer. Consistent with our previously published data (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2013</a>), overexpression of FL-BubR1 had a tumor-protective effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). <i>Bub1b</i><sup>N</sup> and <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394N</sup>, however, were unable to ameliorate the tumor burden of <i>Kras</i><sup>LA1</sup> mice, indicating that binding of Cdc20 mediated by the N-terminal domain is necessary, but not sufficient, to protect against tumor formation. In contrast, <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> fully retained the tumor-protective benefit of FL-<i>Bub1b</i>. In addition to adenomas, Kras<sup>G12D</sup> produces a hyperplastic epithelium throughout the lung, which is prone to aneuploidization as evidenced by FISH for chromosomes 4 and 7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2013</a>). Analysis of hyperplastic lung tissue from <i>Kras</i><sup>LA1</sup> mice containing the FL-<i>Bub1b</i> transgene revealed that BubR1 overexpression has the ability to counteract Kras<sup>G12D</sup>-mediated aneuploidization (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2013</a>). Using FISH analysis, mice expressing the various <i>Bub1b</i> mutant transgenes revealed that tumor protection tightly correlated with an ability to counteract Kras<sup>G12D</sup>-mediated aneuploidization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Taken together, these data are consistent with the idea that BubR1 exerts its anti-neoplastic actions by preserving genomic integrity and suggest that only a subset of functional domains of BubR1 are necessary to afford protection against aneuploidization, which includes the N-terminal domain required for potent inhibition of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Malureanu et al., 2009</a>)."

First, we focused on BubR1-kinetochore localization, as this property has been shown to be important for its role in both error correction and SAC signaling (<a href=\"#bib47\">Malureanu et al., 2009</a>). By immunostaining with antibodies directed against the BubR1\u2009N-terminus, we found that both FL-<i>Bub1b</i> and <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> prometaphases had markedly increased amounts of BubR1 compared to wild-type MEFs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Due to antibody limitations, we were unable to distinguish the ratio of kinetochore-localized endogenous to transgenic BubR1 within the mutant MEFs, with the exception of <i>Bub1b</i><sup>N</sup>, in which only endogenous protein can be detected. This illuminated that endogenous BubR1 was displaced from the kinetochore, but we cannot rule out that the other mutants also had lower endogenous levels at the kinetochore, which is likely due to increased abundance of mutant protein within the cell. By staining with a Flag antibody that recognizes only the transgenic BubR1 protein, we determined that the\u00a0relative expression of BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> was slightly higher than FL-BubR1, while BubR1<sup>N</sup> was equivalent to FL-BubR1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). BubR1<sup>\u0394N</sup>, which did not protect against cancer, failed to localize to kinetochores, consistent with a lack of the GLEBs motif (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</a>). Taken together, these data demonstrate a likely need for BubR1 to retain functionality, perhaps mediated through the N-terminal domain, at the kinetochore to prevent aneuploidy and tumorigenesis."

Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of FL-BubR1 and mutant BubR1 overexpression on mitotic timing by following MEFs from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) to anaphase onset by time-lapse microscopy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Because errors such as misalignments that may be caused by unattached kinetochores can trigger the SAC to delay mitotic progression, only cells that proceeded through mitosis without missegregation defects were included. Overexpression of FL-BubR1 had no impact on mitotic timing and the same was true for BubR1<sup>N</sup> and BubR1<sup>\u2206N</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

We found that while prometaphases of wild-type, FL-<i>Bub1b</i> and <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> MEFs had many Mad2-positive kinetochores, there were very rare incidences of Mad2-positive kinetochores in metaphase (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This indicated that the increased time of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition was delayed independent of unattached chromosomes or otherwise persistent Mad2 signaling. The extension of mitotic timing is a feature that is not shared with FL-overexpression alone, indicating it likely has a minimal contribution to tumor protection in our Kras model. However, it is particularly intriguing as a mechanism to prevent aneuploidy, as KT-MT attachment errors that are not detected by the SAC, namely merotelic attachments, may perhaps be given extra time to allow for the error correction machinery to prevent missegregation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Cimini et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rodriguez-Bravo et al., 2014</a>)."

To do this, we added 100 ng/ml of the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole and monitored the amount of time individual cells stayed arrested in mitosis. FL-BubR1 overexpression caused a slight but significant increase in duration of arrest, with transgenic cells arresting on average for 3.7\u2009hr compared to 3\u2009hr for wild-type MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). <i>Bub1b</i><sup>N</sup> MEFs were unchanged from wild-type, while <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394N</sup> MEFs actually had a slight but significant reduction in arrest time. In contrast, <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> MEFs showed a dramatic extension of checkpoint sustainability, with cells arresting for an average time of 6.2\u2009hr. Thus, the two BubR1 alterations offering tumor protection, overexpression of FL-BubR1 and BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup>, improve checkpoint sustainability although the latter does so much more robustly. In complementary experiments, we challenged the SAC by inhibiting Mps1, a kinase necessary both for the establishment and maintenance of the SAC (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hewitt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu and Winey, 2012</a>). Treatment of MEFs concomitantly with 100 ng/ml nocodazole and a high concentration of the Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 (2 \u00b5M) completely abolished SAC activity irrespective of the <i>Bub1b</i> transgene expressed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). At a four-fold lower inhibitor concentration, wild-type, <i>Bub1b</i><sup>N</sup>, <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394N</sup> MEFs were all capable of mounting a modest mitotic arrest. The relative extension of mitotic arrest in FL-<i>Bub1b</i> and <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> MEFs, however, was considerably higher, with <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> MEFs reaching a similar level of SAC signaling in the presence of 0.5 \u00b5M AZ3146 as wild-type MEFs in the absence of inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thus, under normal SAC conditions and conditions where the SAC signaling is weakened, both BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> and FL-BubR1overexpression seem capable of prolonging mitotic arrest, albeit to different degrees."

To examine whether FL-<i>Bub1b</i>and <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> MEFs might have a lower threshold for SAC activation, we challenged them with low concentrations of nocodazole and monitored time to anaphase onset (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

To test this we used a live-cell imaging-based approach in which we cultured MEFs in 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 1.5\u2009hr to activate the SAC and then monitored mitotically-arrested cells for time to mitotic exit following treatment with either vehicle (DMSO) or 2 \u00b5m AZ3146 as a stimulus for dissolving MCCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In this assay, neither FL-BubR1 nor BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> overexpression permitted an arrest longer than that observed in wild-type MEFs. Additionally, while BubR1-associated PP2A has been shown to be important for error correction in human cells (<a href=\"#bib68\">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</a>), it is also important for silencing the SAC (<a href=\"#bib19\">Espert et al., 2014</a>). As BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> lacks the KARD region implicated in PP2A recruitment, its overexpression could potentially mislocalize PP2A and impede proper SAC silencing. We found PP2A localization to be normal in BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> overexpressing cells, suggesting this branch of signaling is not impacted (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and further supporting that silencing of the SAC is not disrupted. Taken together, these results suggest that the threshold to engage the SAC is instead lowered by the <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> transgene."

To this end, we treated wild-type, <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> and FL-<i>Bub1b</i> MEFs cells with nocodazole for 1\u2009hr before harvesting them by mitotic shake-off. We found that overexpression of FL-BubR1 lead to increased interaction of BubR1 and Cdc20, as had been previously shown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2013</a>). This was confirmed by Cdc20 and Mad2 co-IPs and subsequent analysis of co-precipitating proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>) that indicated there were an increased amount of complexes consisting of BubR1-Cdc20-Mad2, a potent APC/C inhibitor. However, we found that while the total amount of BubR1 (wild-type and mutant) immunoprecipitated in <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> MEFs is increased substantially over normal MEFs, BubR1 lacking the internal Cdc20-binding domain failed to pull-down excess Cdc20 and vice versa (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>). This suggests that while BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> can likely bind to Cdc20, it is not a preferred partner. Surprisingly, the amount of Mad2 co-precipitated by Cdc20 was increased, indicating that a larger proportion of Cdc20 bound Mad2 than in wild-type MEFs, while retaining similar levels of BubR1-Cdc20-Mad2 complexes as wild-type. Immunoprecipitation of Mad2 and Cdc20 and analysis of co-precipitating MCC components confirmed this (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). These unique MCC compositions did not result from changes to total levels of these proteins (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, FL-BubR1 overexpression alone results in the ability for cells to form more mitotic checkpoint complexes compared to wild-type MEFs, which can likely fortify the SAC signaling potential. <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup>, however, exerts its impacts on the MCC through a different mechanism. The increased abundance of Mad2-Cdc20 complexes, albeit a weaker inhibitor of APC/C than a full complement of the MCC, in addition to wild-type levels of MCC could represent a state in which the cells are poised to quickly activate the SAC. This is supported by our data in which <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> show increased sensitivity to a weak SAC-inducing stimulus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

                        "text": "BubR1 is different from other mitotic regulators in that supranormal expression improves numerical chromosomal integrity. Although it will be impractical to overexpress BubR1 for therapeutic purposes, increased insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the positive effects of BubR1 overexpression might create entry points for development of novel anti-cancer treatments based on small molecules that complement current therapies. As a first step, we focused on the roles of BubR1\u2019s Cdc20-binding domains. Here we show that overexpression of the BubR1\u2009N-terminal region is necessary, but not sufficient to prevent Kras-mediated aneuploidy and tumorigenesis, implying that reinforcing pseudo-substrate inhibition of Cdc20-bound APC/C by BubR1 is a requirement but entirely ineffective in isolation. In contrast to the N-terminal Cdc20-binding domain, a region spanning residues 525\u2013700 that includes the elements of the internal Cdc20-binding domain and KARD, is dispensable for the aneuploidy and tumor suppressing effects. Overexpression of BubR1 lacking this region reinforced genomic stability and cancer protection in mice, despite dramatically altering metaphase duration of regularly dividing, unchallenged, MEF cells. We find that key shared characteristics of overexpressed FL-BubR1 and BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> include increased kinetochore localization, increased error correction ability and a more robust SAC, though at differing magnitudes. BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> overexpression was most extreme in altering the SAC in that it appeared to lower the threshold for checkpoint activation and maintenance. By analyzing the mitotic phenotypes of more refined deletion mutants, we determined that the profound length of nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest in this mutant was likely provided by a combined loss of the Phe box and D-box2, which is in alignment to a previous report showing that this region normally serves to shorten mitotic arrest times (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diaz-Martinez et al., 2015</a>). However, whether the increased duration of mitotic arrest is actively participating in attenuation of Kras-mediated tumorigenesis in either FL-<i>Bub1b</i> or <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u2206I</sup> <i>Kras</i><sup>La1</sup> mice is unclear, as oncogenic Kras alone did not negatively impact SAC signaling in MEFs."

We further explored this with a mutant BubR1 lacking a combination of the Phe box, D-box2 and KARD (<i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u2206Phe\u2206KARD</sup>), but also did not see changes to mitotic timing. This suggests that the\u00a0loss of a region within BubR1 between residues 525 and 700, either alone or in combination with the aforementioned domains, might be responsible for influencing the duration of mitosis. Further expansion of this notion could assign new functions related to timing to previously unmapped regions of BubR1."

In FL-<i>Bub1b</i> and <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup>, parameters that positively influence genomic stability such as a robust SAC and improved error correction correlate with loss of Kras-mediated aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the strongest mechanism preventing aneuploidization in our Kras system might be a strengthening of the error correction machinery. Given the heterogeneous nature of lung tumors compared to MEFs, however, it is possible that distinct challenges and defects can arise in Kras lung tumors that are not overtly evident in MEFs."

We proposed two distinct but non-mutually exclusive mechanisms of tumor protection. In the first mechanism, the impact of a hypersensitive SAC combined with an ability to promote proper attachments and prevent misalignments by FL-BubR1 and BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> simply prevents genetic heterogeneity that facilitates cancer progression. Thus, while hyperplasia is still a feature of the lungs, there is a block to full neoplastic transformation because necessary losses of tumor suppressors and gains of cancer promoting genes are prevented."

The competing-networks model proposes that two independent yet competing cell fates oppose each other during mitotic arrest: death by caspase-mediated apoptosis or mitotic slippage resulting from persistent cyclin B1 degradation due to incomplete SAC inhibition (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brito and Rieder, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Topham et al., 2015</a>). Cells with prolonged mitotic arrest have a greater chance and more time to accumulate death signals (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008</a>). Both mutants have an impact on one arm of the competing network branches, as evidenced by their increase in arrest time in mitosis, though BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> appears to have a more significant contribution. This could shift a given cell population towards death rather than survival. However, this hypothesis remains to be rigorously tested in our model especially since oncogenic Kras-infected MEF cells do not show evidence of a weakened mitotic checkpoint. We argue that taking advantage of an extended arrest independent of whether or not the machinery functions normally could still be used to promote cancer cell death, and that BubR1 overexpression would be an entry point to such therapies. Along these lines, microtubules have been targeted in anti-cancer chemotherapy with much success (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dumontet and Jordan, 2010</a>). Furthermore, the use of Wee/Chk1 inhibitors which cause cells to bypass the G2 checkpoint, force reliance on the SAC (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mc Gee, 2015</a>). This could be exploited and we would predict an increased susceptibility to microtubule poisons and cytotoxicity, in particular with a system mimicking BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> or BubR1<sup>\u0394PheD</sup> overexpression."

Here, we conclude, based on more in depth and sophisticated studies to test this aspect of SAC signaling, that there is a modest but significant increase in SAC potency in these cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, overexpression of BubR1<sup>\u2206Phe</sup>, BubR1<sup>\u2206D</sup>, and BubR1<sup>\u2206KARD</sup> deletion constructs in wild-type MEFs also provided a slight but significant increase in mitotic arrest time compared to controls, indicating that they were analogous to FL-BubR1 overexpression alone. It is important to note that the data provided by the extensive analysis of <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u2206I</sup> and <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u2206KARD</sup> MEFs are in disagreement with previous work in human cells, where the KARD was proposed to provide the MT-KT attachment function of BubR1 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</a>). In these studies, introducing exogenous BubR1 with a mutated KARD into systems depleted of endogenous BubR1 have decreased PP2A kinetochore localization, and subsequent chromosome alignment defects (<a href=\"#bib68\">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</a>). In <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> MEFs, however, we do not see increased alignment errors or decreased PP2A kinetochore localization (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and both overexpressed BubR1<sup>\u2206I</sup> and BubR1<sup>\u2206KARD</sup> actually have increased error correction capabilities (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). We emphasize that unlike the studies by Suijkerbuijk and colleagues, our transgene and deletion construct are on the background of a full complement of endogenous BubR1, which may still provide adequate kinetochore docking of PP2A. Furthermore, our data are also in alignment with our previous work in which BubR1<sup>\u2206I</sup> expressed on a BubR1<sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup> background does not show overt increases in misalignments (<a href=\"#bib47\">Malureanu et al., 2009</a>).

Instead, BubR1<sup>\u0394N</sup> may be imposing detrimental effects on the cells, as its overexpression results in a slight increase in aneuploidy and a decreased ability to sustain a checkpoint arrest in MEFs, though in vivo aneuploidy rates do not change. Interestingly, however, while the BubR1\u2009N-terminus appears necessary for physiological benefits, it alone did not exert an anti-tumor effect. FL-<i>Bub1b\u00a0</i>and <i>Bub1b</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> MEFs have increased BubR1 expression at kinetochores (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), corresponding to phenotypic benefits. BubR1<sup>N</sup> cannot localize to kinetochores, in addition to lacking several functional domains such as the putative kinase/pseudokinase domain, the internal Cdc20-binding domain, and KARD. As we have determined from the studies herein that the internal binding domain and KARD are dispensable, kinetochore localization and subsequent action of BubR1 there might be key to beneficial phenotypes, in particular, error attachment (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</a>). This is in agreement with our previous study in which we found BubR1 that is unable to localize to kinetochores due to disruptions of the Bub3-binding domain cannot fully rescue spindle assembly checkpoint or mediate complete corrective effects on misalignment in cells depleted of endogenous BubR1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Malureanu et al., 2009</a>). The use of transgenic strains in which BubR1<sup>N</sup> is artificially tethered to kinetochores and evaluating the impact on SAC and error correction signaling could shed light on this in future studies (<a href=\"#bib46\">Maldonado and Kapoor, 2011</a>). Other transgenic models could parse out the specific contribution of kinetochore-localized overexpression to tumor prevention with a domain mutant that does not permit BubR1 to localize to the kinetochore, as well as overexpression of a kinase-dead BubR1."

Here, we offer a unique perspective by showing the reinforcement of genomic stability through several complimentary mechanisms, with an emphasis on error correction machinery, attenuates tumors in a Kras mouse model of lung cancer. Tumor cells often have compromised DNA repair pathways, and are therefore sensitized to chemotherapies such as topoisomerase inhibitors and alkylating agents that promote cellular damage (<a href=\"#bib10\">Calder\u00f3n-Monta\u00f1o et al., 2014</a>). There are few, if any, cancer treatments that revolve around promoting chromosomal stability and reinforcing known checkpoint pathways.

In mitotic timing experiments, the time interval between nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and anaphase onset was measured in H2B-mRFP positive cells by monitoring unchallenged mitoses. Briefly, cells undergoing NEBD were marked and monitored at two minute intervals until anaphase onset. For SAC sensitivity experiments, cells were treated with nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of either 20 or 10 ng/ml and then monitored from NEBD to anaphase onset. Nocodazole challenge experiments were performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib47\">Malureanu et al., 2009</a>). Briefly, nocodazole was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Cells undergoing NEBD were marked and monitored at 10\u2009min intervals to determine when they decondensed their chromosomes. The duration of arrest in mitosis, which is defined as the interval between NEBD (onset of mitosis) and chromatin decondensation (exit from mitosis without cytokinesis), was then calculated and plotted. For checkpoint silencing and sensitivity experiments, 500 nM or 2 \u00b5M AZ3146 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added either concurrently or in sequence with nocodazole. All experiments were performed on at least three independently generated MEF lines unless stated."

Strikingly, <i>BubR1</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> is more active that the wild type (WT) in establishing or supporting the checkpoint in cultured cells. These results definitively show that the middle region of BubR1 has a negative function in the spindle checkpoint, and are generally consistent with the findings of Diaz-Martinez et al. which showed that human BubR1 with the middle region deleted was more active than BubR1 WT in human cells."

It is unclear why this would lead to a hyperactive checkpoint, as Mad2-Cdc20 is a weaker APC/C inhibitor compared to MCC. One possibility is that <i>BubR1</i><sup>\u0394I</sup> overexpression affects Cdc20 phosphorylation by Bub1 and Plk1, thereby inhibiting APC/C-Cdc20 in an MCC-independent manner. The authors should examine the phosphorylation status of Cdc20. Site-specific Cdc20 antibodies are available for human Cdc20. These might work for mouse Cdc20. If not, phos-tag gels might reveal gel mobility shift of phospho-Cdc20."

It is unclear why this would lead to a hyperactive checkpoint, as Mad2-Cdc20 is a weaker APC/C inhibitor compared to MCC. One possibility is that BubR1<sup>\u0394I</sup> overexpression affects Cdc20 phosphorylation by Bub1 and Plk1, thereby inhibiting APC/C-Cdc20 in an MCC-independent manner. The authors should examine the phosphorylation status of Cdc20. Site-specific Cdc20 antibodies are available for human Cdc20. These might work for mouse Cdc20. If not, phos-tag gels might reveal gel mobility shift of phospho-Cdc20.</i> "
