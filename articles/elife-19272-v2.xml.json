Guided by protein dimerization properties, we examined DNA binding specificities of 270 human bZIP pairs. DNA interactomes of 80 heterodimers and 22 homodimers revealed that 72% of heterodimer motifs correspond to conjoined half-sites preferred by partnering monomers. Remarkably, the remaining motifs are composed of variably-spaced half-sites (12%) or \u2018emergent\u2019 sites (16%) that cannot be readily inferred from half-site preferences of partnering monomers. These binding sites were biochemically validated by EMSA-FRET analysis and validated in vivo by ChIP-seq data from human cell lines. Focusing on ATF3, we observed distinct cognate site preferences conferred by different bZIP partners, and demonstrated that genome-wide binding of ATF3 is best explained by considering many dimers in which it participates. Importantly, our compendium of bZIP-DNA interactomes predicted bZIP binding to 156 disease associated SNPs, of which only 20 were previously annotated with known bZIP motifs."

Guided by protein dimerization properties, we examined DNA binding specificities of 270 human bZIP pairs. DNA interactomes of 80 heterodimers and 22 homodimers revealed that 72% of heterodimer motifs correspond to conjoined half-sites preferred by partnering monomers. Remarkably, the remaining motifs are composed of variably-spaced half-sites (12%) or \u2018emergent\u2019 sites (16%) that cannot be readily inferred from half-site preferences of partnering monomers. These binding sites were biochemically validated by EMSA-FRET analysis and validated in vivo by ChIP-seq data from human cell lines. Focusing on ATF3, we observed distinct cognate site preferences conferred by different bZIP partners, and demonstrated that genome-wide binding of ATF3 is best explained by considering many dimers in which it participates. Importantly, our compendium of bZIP-DNA interactomes predicted bZIP binding to 156 disease associated SNPs, of which only 20 were previously annotated with known bZIP motifs."

Proteins known as transcription factors control the activity of genes by binding to DNA near the start of the genes and switching genes on or off as required. Often transcription factors work together to regulate specific genes in response to signals from other cells or the environment. Failure to control the activity of genes can give rise to cancer, diabetes and a wide array of other diseases."

The experiments show that over two thirds of the bZIP pairs bind to DNA sequences that each individual partner prefers. However, in many cases, the choice of a partner can change the DNA sequence that the pair targets in a manner that could not have been predicted based on the preferences of each partner alone. This suggests that, by pairing up, bZIP transcription factors are able to change their preferences for which location they target in the DNA. The experiments also show that many of the 102 pairs could bind to more than one type of site. Thus, the ability of bZIP proteins to interact with different partners greatly expands the locations on genomic DNA from which they can regulate the activity of different genes."

The combinatorial use of a limited number of TFs provides the means to finely control the complex cellular transcriptome. The ability of a given TF to interact with different partners expands the DNA targeting repertoire. It\u00a0also enhance specificity by focusing combinations of factors to a more specific set of regulatory sites across the genome. Different partners also alter the regulatory potential of a given TF, at times completely altering its regulatory output such that the factor switches from an activator to a repressor of transcription depending on the binding partners with which it associates (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ptashne and Gann, 2002</a>)."

Interestingly, the human bZIP network displays greater ability to form heterodimers compared to simpler eukaryotes, suggesting that more complex combinatorial regulation may contribute to organismal complexity (<a href=\"#bib68\">Reinke et al., 2013</a>). bZIP proteins also interact with other classes of TFs to stabilize higher order oligomers at enhancers (<a href=\"#bib41\">Jain et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Murphy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Thanos and Maniatis, 1995</a>). Their role in nucleating such multi-factor complexes is supported by the observation that certain bZIP dimers such as AP-1 (FOS\u2022JUN) and CEBPA can function as \u2018pioneer\u2019 factors that bind inaccessible chromatin and enable the assembly of other TFs at regulatory sites (<a href=\"#bib8\">Biddie et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Collins et al., 2014</a>). Notably, the choice of dimerizing partner not only impacts DNA recognition properties but can also influence regulatory function of a given bZIP. For example, ATF3 homodimer acts as a repressor, whereas ATF3\u2022JUN activates transcription (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hsu et al., 1992</a>). As a class, bZIPs regulate diverse biological phenomena ranging from response to stress at the cellular level, organ development at the tissue level and viral defense, circadian patterning, memory formation, and ageing at an organismal level (<a href=\"#bib17\">Costa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Herdegen and Waetzig, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Jung and Kwak, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Male et al., 2012</a>).

In 1991, <a href=\"#bib33\">Hai and Curran (1991)</a> showed that some heterodimers have DNA-binding specificities that are distinct from those of each partnering bZIP. For example, JUN\u2022ATF2 heterodimer binds to a cognate site in the ENK2 promoter that is not bound by either JUN\u2022JUN or ATF2\u2022ATF2 homodimers. However, the past 20 years have provided only a handful of additional examples of how bZIP heterodimerization influences DNA-binding specificity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Jolma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Vinson et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yamamoto et al., 2006</a>). Central questions about bZIP transcription factors remain unanswered: What is the influence of protein dimerization on DNA binding? Does DNA stabilize dimer formation? Which protein dimers can bind DNA? Which sequences do they bind? And, how do bZIP-binding sites contribute to cellular function and the etiology of various diseases?"

These pairs were composed from 36 bZIP proteins representing 21 bZIP families and encompassing the diversity of all 53 bZIPs encoded in the human genome (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Given the 666 potential dimeric pairs that can be formed with 36 bZIPs, we used biophysically measured PPIs\u00a0to prioritize the dimers that were examined (<a href=\"#bib68\">Reinke et al., 2013</a>). We selected 126 pairs (97 hetero- and 29 homodimer) that form stable dimers with PPI dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) less than 1 \u00b5M at 21\u00b0C in the absence of DNA. In addition, we tested 144 (137 hetero- and seven homo-) dimer combinations that do not stably associate in solution in the absence of DNA (K<sub>d</sub>\u00a0&gt;1 \u00b5M at 21\u00b0C). For most TFs, including the bZIP class, the DNA specificity of the isolated DNA binding domain (DBD) is typically indistinguishable from the full-length factor (<a href=\"#bib43\">Jolma et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, we focused our efforts on the bZIP domain, which comprises the basic region that binds DNA and the leucine zipper dimerization module that forms a coiled-coil. Recombinant proteins, overexpressed in bacteria, were purified to homogeneity. Two versions of each protein were made, one conjugated to biotin at the carboxyl terminal and the other without. This set of highly purified DNA binding proteins enabled examination of the innate DNA-binding sequence specificity of 36 representative human bZIPs. Individual bZIP partners were mixed in 3:1 molar ratios with the biotinylated partner at the lower concentration; affinity purification of the protein-DNA complexes using the less abundant biotinylated partner enriched for heterodimers. To additionally favor examination of the heterodimer, whenever possible, the interaction partner with the\u00a0weaker homodimer was biotinylated and used for isolating protein-DNA complexes. Each protein dimer is denoted by a dot between each monomer \u2013\u00a0for example, JUN\u2022ATF3. The DNA binding sites are indicated either by a specific sequence or their classical designations, such as CRE or CAAT, or by half-sites connected by a hyphen, such as CRE-CAAT."

In our cognate site identification (CSI) effort using SELEX-seq, a DNA library spanning the entire sequence space of a 20-mer (10<sup>12</sup> different sequence permutations) was independently incubated with each of the 270 different bZIP pairs (234 hetero- and 36 homodimers), and protein-bound DNA sequences were enriched, amplified, and re-probed for an additional two cycles to further enrich cognate sites over non-cognate sites that comprise the majority of the starting library. The starting DNA library as well as selectively enriched sequences were barcoded and sequenced using massively parallel DNA sequencing methods. The CSI intensity, corresponding to the z-score for the enrichment of a sequence, was computed for each 10-mer as described in the methods. Repeated experiments demonstrated an average Pearson\u2019s correlation r\u00a0=\u00a00.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 between CSI intensities from replicates (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Hierarchical clustering of the 102 bZIP-DNA interactomes readily identified six previously known classes of bZIP-binding sites (TRE, CAAT, PAR, MARE, CRE, and\u00a0CRE-L) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). Notably, several bZIP homodimers (ATF6, ATF6B, CREB3L1, and JUN) enriched more than one motif (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Examining the cognate sites bound by heterodimers highlighted the ability of some heterodimers to bind homodimer motifs as well as a range of other heterodimer-specific motifs. Such binding to multiple motifs is reminiscent of previous studies that reported bZIP dimers binding to different sites with different affinities (<a href=\"#bib3\">Badis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kim and Struhl, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">K\u00f6nig and Richmond, 1993</a>). Interestingly, several heterodimers that bind classic bZIP homodimer motifs such as TRE, CRE-L, or CRE displayed clear differences in their preference for a subset of sequences categorized under a single consensus motif (e.g. compare motifs <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> with the CRE-L site). This was also true for different homodimers (e.g. compare CRE-L binding profiles for ATF6, CREB3, CREB3L1, and XBP1 in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Thus, the binding data reported here reveal a sequence sub-structure to classic consensus motifs.

In other words, an <i>emergent</i> site arises as a consequence of heterodimer formation and is not simply comprised of the conjoined or variably-spaced half-sites preferred by each monomer. An elegant study of Hox-Exd heterodimers identified \u2018latent\u2019 sites that were preferred by different Hox factors when they bound DNA in conjunction with Exd (<a href=\"#bib70\">Slattery et al., 2011</a>). Preferences for different sequences at the interface of half-sites or sequences flanking the half sites were observed for different classes of Hox-Exd heterodimers. In our studies, we observed a change in half-site preference of certain bZIPs when they bound DNA as heterodimers. In some instances, homodimers bound with low affinity to sites that emerged as high-affinity sites in the context of a heterodimer, whereas in other cases entirely new site preferences emerged. We classified such newly acquired binding preferences as <i>emergent</i> sites because they are not readily inferred from the binding preferences of homodimers."

In a SEL, all possible sequences of a given length are arranged within concentric circles based on their homology to a seed motif. The seed motif is often derived from position weight matrices (PWMs) of the most enriched sequences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The innermost circle contains all sequences that have an exact sequence match to the seed motif (0-mismatch). As each enriched sequence placed in this ring is an exact match to the seed motif, the source of varying CSI intensity (z-score) is the contribution of the sequences flanking the seed motif. The 1-mismatch ring contains all sequences that differ from the seed motif at any one position, or a Hamming distance of one. The subsequent rings, going outwards, display sequences with increasing number of mismatches to the seed motif. The height and color of each point represents the CSI intensity for the corresponding sequence. As noted above, CSI intensity correlates with binding affinity where measured (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carlson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hauschild et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Puckett et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tietjen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Warren et al., 2006</a>). Although there are far more low-affinity sequences than enriched sequences (as depicted by the illustrative histogram in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), the moderate-to-low affinity sites (low CSI intensity) are often overlooked by motif searching algorithms. Such sequences readily emerge in SEL display of the entire binding data (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carlson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tietjen et al., 2011</a>). In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, we illustrate how SELs are built and we note that a SEL can be constructed using any sequence as a seed motif.

In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, the SELs of JUN\u2022ATF3 and ATF4\u2022CEBPG illustrate the broader insights that emerged from examining specificity profiles of these two heterodimers. JUN\u2022ATF3 binds a CRE site composed of conjoined half-sites for JUN and ATF3. Visualizing the entire JUN\u2022ATF3-DNA interactome via a\u00a0SEL shows that the binding of JUN\u2022ATF3 heterodimer to CRE is significantly influenced by the sequence context that flanks the motif (see affinity variations in the 0-mismatch ring). Additionally, the 3-mismatch ring of the SEL identifies several high-intensity peaks corresponding to additional cognate sites. As indicated, one of these is a variably spaced site, and another is an emergent site <sup>5\u2032</sup>TGACGCAT<sup>3\u2032</sup>. Thus, the SEL highlights that this single heterodimer binds multiple classes of cognate sites. On the other hand, the SEL for ATF4\u2022CEBPG shows that the seed motif <sup>5\u2032</sup>ATGCGCAAT<sup>3\u2032</sup> bound by this heterodimer is relatively insensitive to context effects (0-mismatch ring). The 1-mismatch ring indicates that both half-sites are not equally tolerant of mismatches, with mismatches in the <sup>5\u2032</sup>TGA<sup>3\u2032</sup> core of the CRE site dramatically reducing binding, whereas the <sup>5\u2032</sup>CAA<sup>3\u2032</sup> site is tolerant of deviations at the first position of the half-site but sensitive to deviations in the <sup>5\u2032</sup>AA<sup>3\u2032</sup> positions.

To examine whether the set of sequences that are pointed out in SELs of JUN\u2022ATF3 and ATF4\u2022CEBPG from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> are bound by homodimers or any bZIP in our compendium, we displayed the relative preferences of each dimer for this set of binding sites in a heatmap (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Each column displays the relative preference of each of the 102 bZIP dimers for different sequences, including half-sites of all six classical homodimer motifs. An examination of row 3, which displays preferences of all 102 dimers for the emergent site <sup>5\u2019</sup>TGACGCAT<sup>3\u2019</sup>, indicates that this site is highly preferred by JUN\u2022ATF3 and to some extent by JUN\u2022CEBPG but not by homodimers formed by ATF3, CEBPG, or JUN (denoted by asterisks). While not as exclusive as the JUN\u2022ATF3 emergent site, the conjoined CRE-CAAT site is primarily targeted by heterodimers formed by the\u00a0CEBP family of bZIPs. The heatmap does indicate that this heterodimer-preferred site permits low-affinity binding by the CEBPG homodimer. Interestingly, data in row 8 reveals that substituting <sup>5\u2019</sup>CAAT<sup>3\u2019</sup> with <sup>5\u2019</sup><b><span class=\"underline\">T</span></b>AAT<sup>3\u2019</sup> in the CRE-CAAT site perturbs binding by CEBP heterodimers in a non-uniform manner, unmasking hidden differential sequence preferences of related heterodimers that are opaque to current models that use protein homology to predict cognate site preferences. The C-to-T substitution also expands the repertoire of bZIPs that bind this mutated site. DBP, HLF, and NFIL3 as homo- and hetero- dimers display an unmistakable affinity for this modified CRE-CAAT site that recreates the PAR half-site that is a target of this set of bZIPs. On the other hand, a different substitution at the same position (<sup>5\u2019</sup><b><span class=\"underline\">G</span></b>AAT<sup>3\u2019</sup>) dramatically reduces the binding of all bZIPs to this version of the CRE-CAAT site (row 9). Furthermore, the importance of the sequences flanking a binding site (rows 4 and 5) or the contribution of each half-site to the binding of bZIPs (rows 8\u201310) is also made evident by the heatmap. In essence, SEL plots alongside comparative heatmaps of affinities of proteins for a range of cognate sites bring a new appreciation for diversity of DNA sequences that can be targeted by a given factor."

Each heterodimer was systematically examined with DNA sites that were constructed by conjoining the preferred half-site(s) for each bZIP. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> shows EMSA-FRET data for six heterodimers and corresponding homodimers binding to heterodimer-specific sites (three conjoined sites and three emergent sites). For these sites, the CSI intensity for the heterodimers is higher than the scores for either of the two contributing homodimers. The EMSA-FRET data demonstrate clearly that neither the JUN nor the ATF3 homodimers associate with the emergent site identified for JUN\u2022ATF3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similarly, emergent sites identified for ATF4\u2022CEBPA and ATF4\u2022JUN, and several conjoined sites such as TRE-CAAT for ATF3\u2022CEBPA, CRE-L-CAAT for BATF3\u2022CEBPA, and CRE-CRE-L for BATF3\u2022JUN, were validated by EMSA-FRET as <i>bona fide</i> heterodimer-specific cognate sites that show weaker binding, or no binding, by the contributing homodimers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). EMSA-FRET data also validate the ability of BATF3 to bind emergent CRE-L half-sites as a heterodimer (in addition to the CRE site preferred by the homodimer).

To determine how frequently DNA half-sites derived from homodimer-binding data, when presented as conjoined sites, would bind the corresponding heterodimers, we tested DNA binding by EMSA-FRET for stably interacting bZIP heterodimers (PPI: K<sub>d</sub>\u00a0&lt;1 \u00b5M at 21\u00b0C), and the corresponding homodimers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Consistent with CSI analysis, 52 out of 56 bZIP pairs that form stable heterodimers bound the DNA site made by conjoining the half-site preferred by each monomer. Specific binding to conjoined sites was also detected for 6 out of 27 (22%) pairs that do not stably associate in the absence of DNA (PPI: K<sub>d</sub>\u00a0&gt;1 \u00b5M at 21\u00b0C). This fraction is similar to the 20% of bZIP pairs (29 out of 144) that showed sequence-specific DNA binding in SELEX-seq experiments despite their apparent inability to dimerize in the absence of DNA."

Initially identified as a suppressor of inflammation and the adaptive immune response in resting cells, ATF3 is now associated with numerous diseases including a variety of aggressive and widely occurring cancers (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tanaka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Thompson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yin et al., 2008</a>). ATF3 is able to interact with a large variety of TFs to function as a regulatory hub of cellular adaptive response (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gilchrist et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hai et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2010</a>). As a homodimer, ATF binds to CRE sites and represses a wide array of genes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hai et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2010</a>).

DNA-binding specificities could be assigned with high confidence to nine heterodimers that displayed a range of DNA sequence preferences, including affinity for the CRE site preferred by the homodimer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A and B</a>). Importantly, distinct DNA-binding preferences among ATF3\u2022CEBP and ATF3\u2022BATF heterodimers and their corresponding homodimers were detected. The motifs enriched by the ATF3 homo- and heterodimers can be described in five broad categories: CRE, TRE, CRE-CAAT, CRE-L, and the emergent <sup>5\u2032</sup>TGACGCAT<sup>3\u2032</sup> site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Scatter plots illustrate instances where the CSI intensities of ATF3 heterodimers differ markedly from those of the parent homodimers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>). For example, as evident from high CSI intensities, CRE-CAAT sites (red) are preferably bound by ATF3\u2022CEBPG as compared to ATF3 or CEBPG (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, top panel). Similarly, scores for TRE (green) and <sup>5\u2032</sup>TGACGCA<sup>3\u2032</sup> (black) are higher for JUN\u2022ATF3 than for JUN or ATF3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, middle panel). BATF3\u2022ATF3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom panel) and BATF2\u2022ATF3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, top panel) enrich CRE-L sites (blue), further supporting that CRE-L is an emergent site for BATF family heterodimers (also with JUN in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> further highlights the differences between CRE and TRE binding by ATF3 in its homo versus heterodimer state. An important and recurring observation is that several ATF3 heterodimers (BATF3\u2022ATF3, JUN\u2022ATF3, and JUNB\u2022ATF3) can associate with the CRE site that is bound by the ATF3 homodimer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

To assess how well the in vitro discovered cognate sites explain bound sites in a cellular context, we used area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) values, plotting the true-positive rate (TPR) versus false-positive rate (FPR) for peak detection (Materials and methods). ATF3 homodimer sites spanning the entire spectrum of CSI intensities (z-scores) yielded 0.67\u20130.77 AUC values (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using the AUC-ROC approach, we examined the ability of CSI profiles of nine different ATF3 heterodimers as well as the ATF3 homodimer to identify ATF3 ChIP-seq peaks that might represent heterodimer-bound regions. We used published RNA-seq datasets to verify the expression of the bZIP genes used for the ATF3 heterodimer analysis (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Encode, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gargiulo et al., 2013</a>). Each of the 10 CSI datasets captures a large but varying fraction of the ATF3 peaks and, intriguingly, these data reveal that different ATF3 heterodimers perform better in different cell lines (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>). For example, JUN\u2022ATF3 gives 0.85 AUC in the Glioblastoma line, whereas BATF3\u2022ATF3 better explains the ChIP-seq peaks in H1 and HepG2 cells with AUC of 0.69 and 0.70, respectively. While AUC-ROC curves are not robust to subtle changes, the differences we observe may reflect underlying cell line specific differences in the abundance and regulatory roles of different ATF3 heterodimers. The underlying epigenetic landscapes would further exacerbate these differences. Nevertheless, when considered together, the ATF3 homodimer combined with nine different heterodimers can account for a much larger fraction of ChIP-seq peaks than can the homodimer alone. For example, at an FPR-cutoff of 0.10, in the Glioblastoma cell line, the ATF3 homodimer classified just 39% of the ATF3 ChIP-seq peaks as positive, whereas 85% of the peaks are classified positive by at least one of the ATF3-containing dimers at FPR 0.10. Similar analysis for other cell lines and at different FPR cutoffs is reported in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>."

                                "text": "Given the cell-type-specific differences in genomic sites occupied by ATF3, we scored the ATF3-bound loci for each cell line using the CSI data for 10 ATF3 dimers. Peaks were then clustered based on the FPR-cutoffs for each bound region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a> and Materials and methods). All four cell lines show clear clusters of sites where one or more heterodimer detects a peak at a lower FPR compared to the ATF3 homodimer. Several such clusters are apparent for heterodimers with CEBP or BATF family members. A striking result that emerged from the analysis of the GBM1 cell line is that multiple ATF3-bound genomic loci were better described by ATF3-heterodimers than the homodimer. For GBM1, we further examined two clusters of ChIP peaks for which heterodimers scored better than the ATF3 homodimer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, blue and green clusters in the dendrogram). In the blue cluster, de novo motif discovery revealed enrichment of a CRE-CAAT motif, which is the motif with maximal CSI intensities for CEBP\u2022ATF3 dimers. De novo motif search of ChIP-seq peaks in the green cluster identified the TRE motif, which is the top ranked motif for ATF3 heterodimers formed with JUNB, JUN, FOS, and FOSL1, all of which are expressed in GBM1 cells (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>). This is in contrast to the CRE motif preferred by the ATF3 homodimer. Gene ontology functional annotations of genes linked to the CRE-CAAT (blue) and TRE (green) clusters also differ substantially (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>). CRE-CAAT sites preferred by ATF3\u2022CEBP heterodimers (blue cluster) enriched for gene ontology (GO) terms related to immune response and JAK-STAT signaling, whereas TRE sites (green cluster) enriched for GO terms associated to nutrient sensing, PDGF signaling, and cell junction regulation. This observation lends support to the notion that heterodimers drive cell-type and signal-specific gene networks."

In Tier 1 ENCODE cell lines such as H1 and K562, occupancy of multiple TFs has been charted across the genome (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dunham et al., 2012</a>). We first examined loci co-occupied by ATF3 and CEBPB or JUN. In H1 embryonic stem cells, we identified a region on chromosome I that shows overlapping ChIP peaks for ATF3 and CEBPB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, top panel). This locus is also resistant to DNAse I, suggesting that ATF3 and CEBPB are binding to a seemingly inaccessible part of the genome. Plotting CSI intensities for a given TF across the genome generates CSI-Genomescape<i>s</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>, bottom panels; Materials and methods).

We then used CSI data of different homo- and heterodimers to assign CSI scores within these co-occupied regions. Violin plots clearly demonstrate that regions co-occupied by ATF3 and CEBPB have higher CSI intensities when scored with ATF3\u2022CEBP heterodimers than when scored with ATF3 and CEBP homodimers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This observation is consistent with the ability of the JUN\u2022ATF3 heterodimer to bind consensus CRE sites that are also bound by each contributing homodimer. The perceptibly higher CSI intensity when using JUN\u2022ATF3 cognate sites might arise from heterodimer-preferred TRE sites or heterodimer-specific emergent sites.

We reasoned that non-coding SNPs that are not assigned to known TF cognate sites might be explained with our compendium of new bZIP-DNA interactomes. As a first step, we calibrated our CSI data by examining SNPs that are known to alter binding by CREB1 and CEBPA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> top panel and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The minor allele of rs10993994 in the promoter of the MSMB gene has been associated with prostate cancer and it creates a cognate site that is bound by CREB1 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lou et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, the minor allele of rs12740374 has been associated with myocardial infarction, aberrant plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and enhanced expression of SORT1 gene in the liver (<a href=\"#bib62\">Musunuru et al., 2010</a>). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the G-to-T change generates an optimal CAAT site that is bound by CEBPA. We applied CSI-Genomescape analysis to both SNPs. In both cases, the minor allele has a higher CSI intensity than the corresponding major allele, suggesting that the minor alleles of these SNPs create CEBPA- and CREB1-binding sites (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We added a noise factor to our scoring function to make the fold-change predictions less sensitive to low CSI intensities (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>; Materials and methods). A total of 156 SNPs yielded a greater than twofold difference in CSI intensity between the reference and alternate alleles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>). Displaying the predicted increase (blue) or decrease (red) in binding by 102 bZIP dimers at 156 SNPs reveals minor alleles that are targeted by unique heterodimers as well as mutations that have wide-ranging impacts on multiple bZIP dimers. For example, rs10994336 is predicted to increase CSI intensity by at least twofold for 44 out of 102 bZIP pairs reported here. We also report that 80% of the identified changes impact bZIP heterodimers. In the richly annotated RegulomeDB database that ties SNP impact to occurrence of TF-binding sites, only 20 of 156 SNPs are currently annotated with a bZIP motif (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boyle et al., 2012</a>). It is particularly important to note that many of the SNPs in the database are annotated with PWMs derived from bZIP homodimers, whereas our CSI intensity fold-change predictions for 22 homo- and 80 bZIP heterodimers make use of the entire bZIP-DNA interactomes (all 10-mers). The clusters in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> also point to potential roles of bZIP proteins in less understood diseases and provide new hypotheses for the etiology of such diseases and traits."

Such combinatorial control provides the means to integrate multiple signals and tune the expression of specific genes or sculpt genome-wide transcriptomes in a nuanced manner. The ability of different TFs to form hetero-oligomers via PPI and protein-DNA interaction is an essential feature of this process. While most eukaryotic TFs can bind DNA as monomers, the\u00a0bZIP class of TFs only binds DNA as homo- or heterodimers. The ability of bZIPs to form heterodimers appears to increase with increasing evolutionary complexity, with human bZIPs displaying more intricate heterodimerization networks than <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>D. melanogaster,</i> which in turn, exhibit more complex dimerization networks than <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib68\">Reinke et al., 2013</a>). Comprehensive PPI analysis has shown that 36 human bZIP monomers can form nearly 217 heterodimers, greatly expanding the repertoire of factors that can potentially bind DNA (<a href=\"#bib68\">Reinke et al., 2013</a>). We demonstrate that this diversity of dimers expands the DNA sequence space that can be targeted by bZIPs. Our study further reveals that nearly 20% of the non-interacting bZIP pairs examined can be induced to dimerize at cognate DNA sites, providing yet greater diversity from a modest number of contributing monomers."

An ever-increasing body of evidence now implicates bZIPs in numerous aspects of cellular and organismal function. Given their importance, a systematic study of DNA binding by bZIP heterodimers is clearly essential to understanding their functions. However, despite large surveys charting the TF-DNA interactomes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Badis et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Berger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carlson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fordyce et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Grove et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Jolma et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kamesh et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Nitta et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Noyes et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Siggers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wei et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Weirauch et al., 2014</a>), bZIP dimers were under-scrutinized with only a handful of heterodimers reported thus far (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Jolma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mann et al., 2013</a>). Thus, it was quite unclear prior to this work how dimerization between different bZIP partners would impact DNA recognition.

These 270 bZIP pairs represent a wide survey of the 666 potential pairs that can be formed by 36 monomers. The bZIP-DNA interactomes and specificity landscapes that emerged revealed three classes of cognate sites and several heterodimers displayed an ability to interact with more than one class of binding site. Of the three classes, conjoined half-sites were the most abundant, with nearly 72% of all heterodimers displaying some affinity for such sites. The second class contained variably-spaced half-sites, often overlapping by a single nucleotide. The final class, comprising 16% of the sites, was the least expected \u2018emergent\u2019 class of binding sites, where new non-obvious preferences for half-sites were revealed. Emergent sites targeted by heterodimers fall into \u2018loss of specificity\u2019 or \u2018gain of specificity\u2019 categories, as defined above. EMSA-FRET analyses not only quantified the relative affinities of hetero- and homodimers for these sites but also revealed the widespread ability of heterodimers to associate with cognate sites that have typically assumed to be bound by homodimers. More closely examining the emergent site targeted by ATF3\u2022JUN, we find its occurrence at multiple locations across the human genome and, more importantly, several of these sites are co-occupied by ATF3 and JUN in vivo. Further emphasizing a\u00a0physiological role for these non-obvious binding sites, a SNP that disrupts this site is linked to neurological diseases (<a href=\"#bib36\">Han et al., 2010</a>)."

Access to such nuanced specificity preferences allows better annotation of genome-wide binding data for bZIPs for which specificity profiles and high-quality ChIP data exist. This is particularly relevant because it is not uncommon for ChIP or genomic DNase I footprinting experiments to identify TF-bound regions that lack matches to the consensus motifs for a given TF. Our results suggest that a fraction of such in vivo occupied regions likely contain heterodimer binding sites. Another important insight from our comparative analysis of genome-wide binding profiles across four cell types is that a given heterodimer associates with distinct set of genomic loci in each cell type. The results suggest that underlying chromatin and epigenetic landscapes in different cell types may contribute significantly to the sites that are accessed by bZIP dimers. In this context, the ability of ATF3\u2022CEBPB to bind a cognate site within seemingly closed chromatin is consistent with the ability of bZIPs such as CEBPB and FOS\u2022JUN to function as \u2018pioneer\u2019 factors that first associate with closed chromatin and enable binding of additional TFs to yield transcriptionally active euchromatin (<a href=\"#bib8\">Biddie et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Garber et al., 2012</a>). Whether the ability to bind just one half site is important, or whether DNA-templated dimerization of bZIPs confers any added ability to bind an otherwise inaccessible enhancer in closed chromatin, remains to be determined."

The vast majority of SNPs associated with diseases occur in non-coding regions of the genome and most are not readily annotated by the available TF-DNA interactomes perhaps in part because the focus has been on obtaining consensus motifs of monomeric or homodimeric TFs. Rather than consensus motifs, the use of the full spectrum of binding specificity may enable more accurate mapping of TF-binding sites onto SNPs that are linked to diseases and phenotypic traits. Our compendium of CSI profiles accurately predicted creation of known bZIP cognate sites by previously validated SNPs. Of the 156 SNPs predicted by our CSI profiles to impact bZIP binding, nearly 77% were mapped to bZIP heterodimers, highlighting the importance of determining protein-DNA interactomes for heterodimer TFs. Nearly 64% created bZIP binding sites and were \u2018gain of function\u2019 changes relative to the human reference genome. These results are consistent with the 10-fold greater abundance of bZIP heterodimers over homodimers and the observation that aberrant stimulation of gene networks is arguably a greater contributor to disease etiology (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lee and Young, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mansour et al., 2014</a>). SNPs that disrupt binding also contribute to disease, an example of this form of regulatory perturbation being the loss of the emergent JUN\u2022ATF3-binding site that is associated with Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurological, cognitive and behavioral disorders. Our bZIP-DNA interactomes identify 156 SNPs that potentially impact 646 bZIP binding events, any one of these could potentially contribute to the associated ailments. Not only do our data help better annotate the genome, they also serve as an invaluable resource to generate hypotheses on how genetic variants may contribute to the etiology of a range of diseases."

For bZIP heterodimers, one bZIP partner had a C-terminal biotin tag. bZIP-DNA complexes were pulled down with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Several steps were followed to decrease DNA binding by competing homodimers: (1) a 1:3 molar ratio with an excess of the non-biotinylated bZIP was used to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium from the biotin-labeled homodimer; (2) the biotin-bZIP used for pull-down was chosen as the more weakly interacting homodimer of the two interaction partners. As a convention, when naming bZIP heterodimers, the bZIP-biotin is listed first, unless otherwise stated.

Reads were de-multiplexed by requiring an exact match to the 6 bp barcode and truncated to include only the 20 bp derived from the random portion of the library. On average, we obtained 850,000 reads per barcode. The occurrence of every k-mer (lengths 8 through 14 bp) was counted using a sliding window of size k. To correct for biases in our starting DNA library, we took the ratio of the counts of every k-mer to the expected number of counts in the starting library. The starting library was modeled using a fifth-order Markov Model derived from the sequencing reads corresponding to the starting library (Round 0) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Slattery et al., 2011</a>). We then calculated a CSI intensity (z-score = (x \u2013 \u00b5)/ \u03c3) for each k-mer, using the distribution of k-mer enrichment values for that dimer. The most enriched 10, 12, and 14 bp subsequences were used to derive PWM motifs using MEME. Samples that failed to enrich specific sequences relative to the starting library (Round 0) or that only enriched low-complexity sequences were not included in further analysis.

The assay relies on the ability to observe FRET between two fluorophores, TAMRA and fluorescein, as well as to detect each fluorophore in the absence of FRET (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The assay also measures DNA fluorescence to ensure that protein-DNA complexes are being examined. Two versions of each bZIP were made, one conjugated to TAMRA and the other to fluorescein. We observed that the fluorophores reproducibly retard (TAMRA) or increase (fluorescein) the mobility of the bZIP protein that they are attached to and thus assist in resolving each heterodimer with respect to the two homodimers formed by contributing partners. The sequences of all the DNA sites used are listed in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>. Each site was flanked by six constant nucleotides on each side (GAGTCC-site-CCGTAG). Oligos modified on the 5\u2032 end with the dye TYE 665 (IDT, Coralville, IA) were annealed with an unlabeled reverse-complement oligo. Binding reactions contained 50 nM of each fluorescein- and TAMRA-labeled proteins, 10 nM annealed dye-labeled DNA in 20 \u00b5l of binding buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 5 ng/\u00b5l poly (dI-dC), 0.5 mM TCEP). Samples were mixed, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, and then at 21\u00b0C for 30 min. NOVEX 6% DNA retardation gels were loaded with 16 \u00b5l of each sample (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and run at 300V for 20\u201322 min at 22\u201325\u00b0C. Gels were then imaged using a Typhoon 9500 scanner (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) with separate channels for fluorescein, TAMRA, TYE 665, and FRET. Bleed through between channels was corrected using the spectral-unmixing plugin in ImageJ (<a href=\"http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/\">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</a>). The amount of DNA bound for the homodimers was calculated by quantifying the DNA signal that corresponded to all three bound species (fluorescein homodimer, TAMRA homodimer, and mixed-dye homodimer). For the heterodimers, the amount of DNA bound was calculated by quantifying the DNA signal that corresponded to the mixed dye heterodimer. The amount of bound DNA was divided by the amount of unbound DNA run without protein added. For each heterodimer, the interaction was measured twice, with the fluorescein and TAMRA dye on different proteins, and the average of the two measurements is reported."

The authors used SELEX-seq experiments to characterize the binding specificities of 80 heterodimers and 22 homodimers, and used proper control experiments to ensure that the data is interpreted correctly (e.g. they tested that the choice of which bZIP monomer is biotinylated does not affect results)."

Our SEL-based evaluation of various publicly available protein-DNA interactomes revealed up to 40% had compressed multiple related motifs into low-information content generic motifs (Carlson et al. <i>PNAS</i> 2010). Furthermore, the contribution of flanking sequences to binding even the most ideal consensus motifs is greatly dampened by most motif finding algorithms (as noted by us in publications from 2006 onwards and by others \u2013Gordon et al. <i>Mol Cell</i> 2013). Thus, we request the reviewers consider our inclusion of the heatmap (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) alongside our SEL displays as scholarly effort to increase the general awareness and appreciation of the breadth of cognate sequences bound by DNA (and RNA) binding proteins."
