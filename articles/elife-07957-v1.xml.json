However, the importance of translational regulation during mitosis remains poorly understood. Here, using ribosome profiling, we find both a global translational repression and identified \u223c200 mRNAs that undergo specific translational regulation at mitotic entry. In contrast, few changes in mRNA abundance are observed, indicating that regulation of translation is the primary mechanism of modulating protein expression during mitosis. Interestingly, 91% of the mRNAs that undergo gene-specific regulation in mitosis are translationally repressed, rather than activated. One of the most pronounced translationally-repressed genes is Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex (APC) which is degraded during mitosis. We show that full APC activation requires translational repression of Emi1 in addition to its degradation. These results identify gene-specific translational repression as a means of controlling the mitotic proteome, which may complement post-translational mechanisms for inactivating protein function."

However, the importance of translational regulation during mitosis remains poorly understood. Here, using ribosome profiling, we find both a global translational repression and identified \u223c200 mRNAs that undergo specific translational regulation at mitotic entry. In contrast, few changes in mRNA abundance are observed, indicating that regulation of translation is the primary mechanism of modulating protein expression during mitosis. Interestingly, 91% of the mRNAs that undergo gene-specific regulation in mitosis are translationally repressed, rather than activated. One of the most pronounced translationally-repressed genes is Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex (APC) which is degraded during mitosis. We show that full APC activation requires translational repression of Emi1 in addition to its degradation. These results identify gene-specific translational repression as a means of controlling the mitotic proteome, which may complement post-translational mechanisms for inactivating protein function."

Therefore, Emi1 needs to be inactivated in mitosis so that the APC can become active and promote progression to the next phase of the cell cycle. It was previously shown that Emi1 is destroyed during mitosis to allow the APC to operate. Tanenbaum et al. found that translation of the Emi1 mRNA must also be suppressed during mitosis in order to keep Emi1 protein levels very low and allow the APC to become fully active. These findings uncover a new role for the control of protein production in regulating the cell cycle. The next challenge will be to find out whether suppression of translation is also used in other biological systems where proteins need to be rapidly inactivated."

Transcriptional regulation plays an important role in this temporal expression pattern, as many genes show cell cycle-stage specific expression of their mRNA level (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cho et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Whitfield et al., 2002</a>). Regulated protein degradation also plays a key role in sculpting the proteome during the cell cycle, particularly at the end of mitosis when a large set of proteins is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), and then degraded by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib38\">Peters, 2006</a>)."

                        "text": "In addition to regulation of transcription and protein degradation, changes in translation efficiency (TE) also can modify protein abundance during the cell cycle. Translational regulation plays a particularly important role during the specialized cell division cycles of meiosis and early embryonic development, since transcription is largely silent at this stage (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mendez and Richter, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Groisman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Weill et al., 2012</a>). For example, initial work on meiosis in vertebrate oocytes revealed that lengthening of the poly(A) tails of dormant mRNAs through polyadenylation results in translational activation, which plays a critical role in meiotic progression (<a href=\"#bib54\">Weill et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>). While somatic cells appear to use transcriptional regulation as a major mechanism for modulating protein expression during the cell cycle, translational regulation has been described in somatic cells as well (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sivan and Elroy-Stein, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Novoa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kronja and Orr-Weaver, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aviner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Stumpf et al., 2013</a>). As in meiosis, changes in the poly(A) tail length can occur during G2 phase of the mitotic cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib37\">Novoa et al., 2010</a>), but these effects appear to be less important for translational regulation during the somatic cell cycle than during early embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib50\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>). Perhaps the most striking example of translation regulation in the somatic cell cycle occurs during mitosis, when translation is thought to be globally repressed (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fan and Penman, 1970</a>). This global translational repression appears to be sequence-independent, and likely affects most mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fan and Penman, 1970</a>). While such global translational repression was observed many decades ago, its functional significance remains unknown. Several studies suggested that this global translational repression may facilitate the selective synthesis of a small number of proteins that can escape global inhibition through a non-canonical, mRNA cap-independent translation initiation mechanism dependent on internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cornelis et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pyronnet et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Qin and Sarnow, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schepens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wilker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Marash et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ramirez-Valle et al., 2010</a>). However, recent work challenged the view that translation in mitosis is mediated to a significant extent by IRESes, and instead found that canonical, cap-dependent translation dominates in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shuda et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, it is unclear whether IRES-dependent translation represents a general mechanism of translational regulation during mitosis, and whether such IRES-dependent translational activation represents, a minor, or the dominant mechanism of gene-specific translational regulation during mitosis."

A recent study applied this technology to investigate the mechanism of cell cycle-dependent translational control and found hundreds of genes that show changes in TE during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stumpf et al., 2013</a>). Many mRNAs showed altered translation rates in mitosis when compared to either G1 or S phase cells. However, this study did not include analysis of G2 phase cells, which is required to determine whether observed changes are mitosis-specific, as G2 phase cells are very similar to mitotic cells, but very different from G1- or S-phase cells, at least with respect to mRNA levels (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cho et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Whitfield et al., 2002</a>). Thus, it is imperative to compare mitotic cells with both G2 cells (pre-mitotic entry) and G1 cells (post-mitotic exit) in order to identify the translational changes that occur specifically during mitosis. It is also critical to obtain a minimally perturbed population of mitotic cells. Previous studies of mitotic translational regulation relied on synchronizing cells in mitosis with microtubule targeting drugs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fan and Penman, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pyronnet et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Stumpf et al., 2013</a>), but recent work has shown that translation rates are dramatically affected by treatment with such drugs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sivan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Coldwell et al., 2013</a>), thereby complicating the annotation of mitosis-specific translation effects."

                        "text": "Here, using metabolic labeling, combined with ribosome profiling and a tight cell cycle synchronization protocol that does not require microtubule drug treatment, we have identified two distinct translational programs that occur during mitosis. First, using metabolic labeling of non-transformed RPE-1 cells, we find a modest (\u223c35%) global translational repression of the bulk of mRNAs during mitosis, which is consistent with findings in other studies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fan and Penman, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bonneau and Sonenberg, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pyronnet et al., 2001</a>). In addition to this modest global repression, using ribosomal profiling, we identify a subset \u223c200 of mRNAs that show much larger (&gt;threefold), gene-specific changes in their TE during mitosis. The large majority of the latter group of mRNAs are translationally repressed at mitotic entry and then translationally re-activated at mitotic exit, highlighting the precise temporal specificity of this gene-specific translational regulation. Thus, translational repression, rather than IRES-dependent activation of mRNA translation, is the dominant method of gene-specific translational regulation in mitosis, although minor effects of IRES-dependent translation cannot be ruled out. Follow-up studies on one of these translationally repressed genes, Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1), a potent inhibitor of the APC, reveals that translational repression in mitosis is important to prevent new Emi1 protein synthesis at a time when the existing Emi1 protein pool is degraded. These results lead to a model in which the combined activities of protein degradation and translational repression ensures the complete removal of Emi1 protein, which enhances APC activation and the degradation of APC substrates at the end of mitosis. These results provide the first genome-wide view of the translational changes that occur specifically in mitosis and reveal that translational regulation can enhance the efficiency of post-translational protein inhibition, which may represent a more general function for translational repression."

In ribosome profiling, the small fragments of mRNA (\u223c30 nt) that are associated with a ribosome (called the ribosome footprints [FPs]) are isolated and quantitatively analyzed by deep sequencing. This sequence information allows the calculation of the average number of ribosomes per mRNA, which reports on the TE of each mRNA. In parallel, we analyzed total mRNA content by RNA-seq. As many cell cycle-regulated pathways are deregulated in cancer, we used a non-transformed human epithelial cell line, RPE-1, for these studies, as these cells can be precisely synchronized in the cell cycle (see below)."

In this protocol, cells are first arrested in G2 using the CDK1 inhibitor. CDK1 is largely inactive during G2 and only becomes activated at the end of G2/prophase (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jackman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gavet and Pines, 2010</a>). Thus, the inhibitor prevents the progression out of G2, but the low CDK1 state in the presence of the CDK1 inhibitor reflects the normal G2 phase in unsynchronized cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jackman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gavet and Pines, 2010</a>). To release cells from G2, the CDK1 inhibitor is washed out and the cells progress into M and then G1, and pure (95%) populations of M and G1 cells can be obtained based upon the timing of release from G2 arrest (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Thus, this cell synchronization protocol is minimally perturbing and avoids the use of drugs that arrest cells in mitosis by targeting microtubules, which are known to affect translation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sivan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Coldwell et al., 2013</a>)."

The number of ribosome FPs (which reports on the amount of total translation) was determined for each mRNA and was divided by the total mRNA abundance to obtain the TE.

Furthermore, there is a good correlation in the fold change in TE between G2 vs M and G1 vs M for individual mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

                                "text": "Next, we examined whether there were particularly types of genes that were predominantly regulated by translational vs transcriptional control, so we performed gene ontology enrichment analysis using the functional annotation tool DAVID (<a href=\"#bib22\">Huang da et al., 2009</a>). Many genes that exhibited variations in mRNA levels during the cell cycle are involved in cell division (p-values &lt; 10<sup>\u22129</sup>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In contrast, the translationally regulated genes were functionally very different from the transcriptionally regulated genes and included many signaling molecules, transcription factors, and transmembrane proteins (significantly enriched with p-values &lt; 10<sup>\u22128</sup>) (see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Manual curation of the mRNAs that showed gene-specific translational repression during mitosis revealed regulation of several components of the same pathway. For example, multiple components of the PI3 kinase pathway were translationally repressed during mitosis (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We also found mitosis-specific translational downregulation of the mitotic phosphatases PP1\u03b3 and PP2a\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). During mitosis, these phosphatases are strongly inhibited through phosphorylation and binding to inhibitory proteins (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wurzenberger and Gerlich, 2011</a>), suggesting that mitotic translational repression may represent an additional back-up mechanism to inhibit protein function (see Discussion). Consistent with this notion, we found that overexpression of either PP1\u03b3 or PP2a\u03b2 phosphatase strongly disrupted normal cell division (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). We also found a strong translational repression of two key regulators of centriole duplication, Plk4 and CP110 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Habedanck et al., 2005</a>). Finally, the majority of histones showed a strong reduction in protein synthesis in M compared with G2. Newly synthesized histones may not incorporate readily into highly condensed mitotic chromosomes, which perhaps could explain why their translation is reduced during mitosis, although we cannot completely rule out a small contamination of S-phase cells in the G2 sample which might give rise to an apparent high level of translation of histone mRNAs in G2. We also found a few mRNAs that were translationally increased in mitosis as compared to both G1 and G2, although most were below our threshold of threefold change, indicating the changes were subtle. Included in this list are genes involved in cytoskeleton function and DNA replication initiation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E,F</a>), the latter of which may reflect the ability of cells to license DNA replication at the end of mitosis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clijsters et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, these results show that transcriptional and gene-specific translational control dominate at different stages of the cell cycle (transcription at the G1-to-G2 transition and translational regulation dominating at the more rapid G2-to-M transition) and regulate a distinct set of genes."

(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). First we wished to confirm that regulation of Emi1 expression is due solely to translational regulation, not to changes in Emi1 mRNA expression. To establish that mRNA levels of Emi1 remain unchanged as cells progress into mitosis, we performed single molecule FISH and found that Emi1 mRNA was present at similar levels in G2 and M (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). However, since these FISH probes detect all known Emi1 isoforms, we also wished to determine whether isoform specific regulation may occur. First, we confirmed that the same mRNA isoforms were expressed in G2 and M (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Furthermore, we mapped the regulatory element in the Emi1 UTRs, and found that the translational repression was conferred by the 3\u2032UTR of Emi1 alone, which is identical in all Emi1 mRNA isoforms (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,F</a>). Consistent with this, all 5\u2032UTR isoforms in combination with the Emi1 3\u2032UTR were regulated in a similar manner (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,F</a>). Together, these results confirm the conclusion that the inhibition of Emi1 protein synthesis in M is due to translational repression, and show that the 3\u2032UTR of Emi1 is sufficient for this translational regulation."

First, we confirmed that mCherry-Emi1 was degraded in late G2/early mitosis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), as found previously (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guardavaccaro et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Margottin-Goguet et al., 2003</a>).

These fluorescence reporter substrates were all rapidly degraded in anaphase/telophase in control cells as expected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). When Emi1 lacking its normal 5\u2032 and 3\u2033 translation regulatory elements was expressed, cells progressed through mitosis normally and the bulk of Emi1 protein was degraded; however, APC/Cdh1 activation in telophase was partially inhibited, as indicated by the decreased degradation of APC/Cdh1 substrates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Importantly, exogenous Emi1 was expressed at similar levels as the endogenous gene in these experiments, as determined by transcript counting by single molecule FISH (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Here we confirm a modest (35%) and general repression of translation in mitosis, but in addition, our genome-wide analyses revealed much larger (&gt;300%) effects on TE of several hundred specific mRNAs, the large majority of which involve translational repression rather than activation. Thus in summary, the mitotic translational program is dominated by a modest global translational repression, combined with potent repression of a subset of mRNAs, which acts on top of the global repression. Our follow-up studies on Emi1 suggests that its translational repression acts as a mechanism to enhance post-translational protein inactivation, which could represent a more general function of translational repression in mitosis and in other processes."

CDK1, for example, is known to phosphorylate a number of translation factors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heesom et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dobrikov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shuda et al., 2015</a>) and this could affect TE. However, we feel that the major conclusions regarding selective translational repression in mitosis are unlikely to be due to the use of this CDK1 inhibitor for cell synchronization for three reasons. First, the genome-wide comparison of TE of G1 vs M cells (neither of which have any drug present) yields very similar results to the comparison of G2 (RO-3306 present) vs M cells. Second, we confirmed translational regulation of a selected subset of mRNAs using a single cell fluorescence-based assay that does not involve the use of the CDK1 inhibitor. Third, the CDK1 inhibitor is only present in our G2 sample, a time at which CDK1 is mostly inactive in unperturbed cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jackman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gavet and Pines, 2010</a>). Consistent with this, the translation inhibitor 4E-BP1, which is phosphorylated by CDK1 in mitosis, is not detectably phosphorylated in G2 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heesom et al., 2001</a>). Thus, our synchronized G2 sample closely mimics the G2 phase of unsynchronized cells with respect to CDK1 activity. Together, these results strongly support the conclusion that the observed translational effects reported in this study are due to distinct cell cycle states and not an effect of drug treatment."

Furthermore, the cell cycle timing of transcriptional and translational regulation also differ; the majority of gene-specific translational changes occur at entry and exit from mitosis (G2-to-M and M-to-G1 transitions), while transcriptional changes predominate between G1 and G2. We also show that the vast majority of the \u223c200 translationally-regulated mRNAs are repressed (several fold below the modest global down-regulation of translation in mitosis) rather than activated. Thus, we conclude that the dominant function of gene-specific translational regulation during mitosis is to potently inhibit synthesis of a relatively small subset of the proteome. Our work complements another cell cycle ribosomal profiling study by Stumpf et al.

This limits the usefulness of transcriptional regulation to longer time transitions in the cell cycle, specifically from G1 to S or G2. On the other hand, translational control alters protein synthesis rates almost instantaneously, which makes it well suited to the short time scale of mitosis, which is generally less than 1 hr in most somatic cells with doubling times of 1\u20132 days. Interestingly, a recent study of mouse dendritic cell activation, which happens at a time-scale of many hours, similar to the G1-S transition, found that the vast majority of changes in protein synthesis were due to altered mRNA abundance, rather than due to changes in translation rates (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jovanovic et al., 2015</a>). A second unique feature of translational control is its rapid reversibility, enabling protein synthesis to restart quickly when cells exit from mitosis and enter G1. Thus, translational control may be employed when acute changes in protein synthesis are needed (e.g., entry into and exit from mitosis), while transcriptional control is used to affect slower changes in gene expression."

In previous reported cases of translational regulation of specific mRNAs during mitosis, the findings were predominantly of translational activation through an IRES-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cornelis et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pyronnet et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Qin and Sarnow, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wilker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Marash et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ramirez-Valle et al., 2010</a>). While we also found a small number of mRNAs that were translated more efficiently during mitosis (16 and 6 mRNAs were translationally upregulated &gt;threefold in mitosis compared to G2 and G1, respectively), the vast majority of regulated mRNAs were translationally repressed (187 and 97 mRNAs were downregulated in mitosis compared to G2 and G1, respectively). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the IRES-mediated upregulation of translation in mitosis may be relatively weak compared to the cut-off (&gt;threefold) that we have used in this study to identify changes in gene-specific TE. A previous study of IRES-mediated translational upregulation found that only one of three proteins examined was upregulated by &gt; threefold (<a href=\"#bib41\">Qin and Sarnow, 2004</a>). Furthermore, a recent study found that translation in mitosis is dominantly cap-dependent (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shuda et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that IRES-mediated translation may only make a minor contribution to the translational landscape in mitosis. The results from our work and Shuda et al., while not ruling out IRES-dependent translational activation of some genes in mitosis, indicates that the dominant function of gene-specific translational regulation is to shut down rather than activate synthesis of proteins during mitosis."

Oocytes stockpile maternal mRNA, as new transcription does not occur until the mid-blastula stage of development. Due to the absence of transcriptional control, translational regulation is the main mechanism by which protein synthesis rates are tuned. In these systems, translational regulation occurs largely by modulating poly(A) tail length (<a href=\"#bib54\">Weill et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>). While changes in poly(A) tail length also occur on a subset of mRNAs during the mitotic cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib37\">Novoa et al., 2010</a>), regulation of poly(A) tail length does not appear to be a general mechanism for controlling TE in somatic cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>). Thus, translational control in meiosis is most likely mechanistically distinct from the gene-specific translational regulation during mitosis described here. Consistent with this, we find that the large majority of regulated mRNAs are translationally repressed during mitosis, while in meiosis regulatory mechanisms mainly function to specifically activate a subset of mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mendez and Richter, 2001</a>). Furthermore, the sets of genes that are regulated during meiosis and mitosis are largely non-overlapping. Interestingly, Emi1 is an exception to this rule, as it is translationally regulated during both meiosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</a>) and mitosis (this study). However, in meiosis it is translationally activated through control of its poly(A) tail length by the RNA binding protein CPEB (<a href=\"#bib2\">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</a>). This does not appear to be the case during mitosis, as mutation of all CPEB binding sites in the 3\u2032UTR of Emi1 does not prevent translational repression in mitosis (unpublished observation). Therefore, we conclude that the gene-specific translational control program in mitosis identified here is distinct from the meiotic translation program."

The average protein half-life is many hours (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</a>), while mitosis takes less than an hour, so inhibition of protein synthesis for this short period of time is not expected to have a major impact on overall protein levels. Our analysis of Emi1 offers a clue to the role of gene-specific translational repression during mitosis. During mitosis pre-existing Emi1 protein is inactivated through phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guardavaccaro et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Margottin-Goguet et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Moshe et al., 2011</a>). However, we find that in the presence of continued protein synthesis, degradation cannot remove all of the Emi1, resulting in a small amount of residual Emi1 protein levels at the end of mitosis, which can interfere with full APC activation. In contrast, when new Emi1 protein synthesis is inhibited through translational repression, Emi1 is eliminated more completely (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Transcriptional inhibition at the G2/M transition would not afford a similar effect, since protein synthesis rates would not decline substantially within the required time-scale due to relatively slow mRNA turnover."

All remaining reads were aligned to the human (hg19) genome. Finally, still-unaligned reads were aligned to known canonical mRNA. Reads with unique alignments were used to compute the total number of reads obtained for each transcript. FP alignments were assigned to specific P site nucleotides by using the position and total length of each alignment, calibrated from FPs at the beginning and the end of CDSes. FP and mRNA densities were calculated in units of reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) in order to normalize for gene length and total number of reads per sequencing run. The density of ribosome FPs is used as a measure of the rate of translation and TE is defined as the ratio of FP density/total mRNA.

We found that genes that had more than 200 reads total showed very strong reproducibility between replicates (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Therefore, we excluded from the analysis genes that had less than 200 reads.

For differences in TE, we used a &gt;threefold difference in TE combined with a &gt;twofold difference in FP RPKM. We reasoned that an increase in TE is only biologically meaningful if it is accompanied by an increase in FP RPKM, as this indicates that the total amount of protein synthesis is increased on the specific mRNA.

Cells were either harvested at this point to obtain a G2 sample or the CDK1 inhibitor was removed to allow cells to enter mitosis. Upon removal of the inhibitor, \u223c50% of cells progressed into mitosis in a highly synchronous manner. At 45 min after RO release, mitotic cells were isolated using mechanical shake-off and either harvested to generate the mitotic sample or re-plated to allow mitotic exit and then harvested as a G1 sample 3 hr after re-plating. Global translation rates were measured using a 10 min incubation with S35-methionine. Cells were then washed and lysed and total protein was analyzed on a denaturing gel. Total radioactive S35 incorporation was quantified by measuring the intensity of the entire lane on the gel."

An NLS was also added, concentrating the protein in the nucleus, which simplifies analysis and increases the signal-to-noise ratio. The DHFR-sfGFP-NLS protein was continuously degraded in the absence of the small molecule stabilizer, but rapidly accumulated upon stabilization by trimethoprim (TMP). Indeed, addition of TMP resulted in a rapid increase in GFP fluorescence, which was due to synthesis of new protein. Thus, the increase in GFP fluorescence is a good readout for the rate of translation of the reporter. However, different cells within a population usually contain different copy numbers of the reporter, and therefore showed different rates of GFP fluorescence increase. We therefore inserted a short viral P2A sequence after the GFP-NLS, which allows expression of a second independent protein from the same transcript with very high efficiency (&gt;90%, [<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2011</a>]), due to the inability of the ribosome to form a peptide bond at the end of the P2A sequence. Downstream of the P2A sequence, we inserted a NLS-mCherry protein, which is insensitive to the degron, as the NLS-mCherry protein is physically separated from the DHFR-GFP-NLS protein. Levels of mCherry can thus be used to normalize for the total amount of reporter per cell (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Aurora A was cloned upstream of GFP into the pHR lentiviral expression vector using MluI-NotI restriction sites (hereafter called pHR vector) with a truncated SV40 promoter to reduce expression levels. Emi1 was inserted downstream of mCherry in the pHR vector using BamHI-NotI. For the pHR-mCherry-P2A-PP1\u03b3, mCherry was first PCR amplified and a P2A sequence was inserted into the 3\u2032 primer with an extra RsrII restriction site. mCherry-P2A was then inserted in pHR using BstX1-NotI, after which PP1\u03b3 was inserted downstream of the P2A sequence with RsrII-NotI. For pHR-mCherry-P2A-strepII-PP2a\u03b2, mCherry was first PCR amplified with P2A-StrepII-tag sequence, as well as an extra 3\u2032SpeI site in the 3\u2032 primer. mCherry-P2A-strepII was then inserted into pHR, after which PP2a\u03b2 was inserted in this vector using SpeI-Not1. The fluorescence-based translation reporter was cloned using fusion PCR of three parts: 1. DHFR(Y100I), 2. sfGFP-NLS-P2A 3. NLS-mCherry. The product was cloned into the pHR vector using BstXI-NotI. All 5\u2032 UTRs were inserted using BstXI-BsiWI and 3\u2032UTRs were inserted using RsrII-NotI. Sequences of the entire reporter and all 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs used in this study can be found in the supplemental methods section. Primers to amplify the UTRs used in this study were based on the RNA-seq data to represent the most common UTR splice variant in RPE-1 cells."

Mol Cell Biol, 2014; 34:439-451), and that CDK1 phosphorylation of these two translation initiation components dramatically affects their translational activity. Therefore, the criticism against microtubule targeting drugs may also be true for CDK1 inhibitors. How can the authors be sure that the data obtained are not due to side effects on translation initiation instead of cell cycle-dependent events? This important comment applies to all the comparisons made with G2-arrested cells as they have been obtained by incubating cells with the CDK1 inhibitor for 18 hours. Unfortunately, the main message of the paper arises from comparisons between mitotic and G2-arrested cells."

In this study, Tanenbaum et al. investigated regulation of mRNA translation during mitosis using ribosome profiling. They show that the mRNA levels in G2 and M phase cells are similar, but distinct from G1. In contrast, translation efficiency is similar in G2 and G1, but very different in M where the vast majority of mRNAs are translationally repressed. As the authors note, this conclusion is not novel as the decline in the rate of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells during mitosis has been has been known for a very long time (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fan and Penman, 1970</a> and the citations therein). The novelty here is in the methodology (ribosome profiling) and the conclusion for indiscriminate inhibition of translation of mRNAs during mitosis. The latter is in contrast to previously published data showing that \u223c3% of mRNAs are associated with large polysomes and remain active during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Qin and Sarnow, 2004</a>). Several other studies (mentioned in this article) have also demonstrated that internal initiation of translation is not inhibited during mitosis, in contrast to cap-dependent translation. Finally, IRES-mediated translation of poliovirus, mengovirus and human immunodeficiency type 1 virus is clearly not inhibited in mitotically-arrested (by nocodazole) cells, and these viruses replicate well in these cells, whilst viruses that rely on cap-dependent translation cannot replicate (Johnson and Holland, 1965, J Cell Biol. 27, 565-574; Lake et al., 1970, J Virol. 5, 262-263; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bonneau and Sonenberg, 1987</a>, J Biol. Chem. 262, 11134-11139; Brasey et al., 2003. J Virol. 77, 3939-3949). It is not clear whether different cell lines, cell synchronization protocols or methods to evaluate translation efficiency (ribosome vs. polysome profiling) account for the observed differences. Given the significant discrepancies with published data, the authors should use other methodological approaches to support their conclusions. It is also puzzling why the authors were surprised by the results. Considering that only IRES-containing mRNAs, which constitute perhaps 3% of total mRNAs, are translationally active in mitosis, the observed results are expected rather than surprising. The Abstract and text should be changed to reflect this."

Mol Cell Biol, 2014; 34:439-451), and that CDK1 phosphorylation of these two translation initiation components dramatically affects their translational activity. Therefore, the criticism against microtubule targeting drugs may also be true for CDK1 inhibitors. How can the authors be sure that the data obtained are not due to side effects on translation initiation instead of cell cycle-dependent events? This important comment applies to all the comparisons made with G2-arrested cells as they have been obtained by incubating cells with the CDK1 inhibitor for 18 hours.

However, throughout most of the G2 phase, CDK1 is completely inactive (Jackman et al., Nat. Cell.

Thus, our G2 sample, which is created by addition of a highly specific CDK1 inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vassilev, PNAS, 2006</a>), actually mimics the normal G2 state very closely with respect to low CDK1 activity. Importantly, the notion that CDK1 is not active in phosphorylating general translation factors in G2, is fully supported by experimental data showing no significant phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in G2 phase (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heesom et al., 2001</a>, Curr.

Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4GI by CDK1 then occurs during mitosis (Shuda et al., PNAS, 2015; Dobrikov et al., MBoC 2014) at a time when CDK1 activity is very high. These phosphorylation events could contribute to the effects on translation that we observed; however, these effects occur both in unperturbed M cells and the synchronized M cells in our study, which both have robust CDK1 activity. In summary, the use of a CDK1 inhibitor to arrest cells in G2 followed by its washout closely mimics the CDK1 levels in unperturbed cells in their G2, M and G1 states."

However, this \u201cglobal\u201d translational repression is conceptually distinct from the highly selective and <i>gene-specific</i> translational repression that we describe in this manuscript. We find (through S35met labelling) that the bulk of mRNAs show roughly a 30% decrease in translation in mitosis as compared to G2 or G1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), in overall agreement with earlier studies. This effect, which may be related to phosphorylation of general translation factors during mitosis by a mitotic kinase such as CDK1, is thus widespread and occurs indiscriminately and independent of mRNA sequence. However, we show for the first time that a small subset of mRNAs (1-2% of all mRNAs) deviates from the bulk, suggesting that these mRNAs undergo an additional, <i>gene-specific</i> regulation<i>.</i> This <i>gene-specific</i> regulation may occur through binding of RNA-binding proteins to the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019UTR; indeed the <i>gene-specific</i> nature of this regulation is confirmed by the fact that fusion of their UTR sequences to a reporter confers translational regulation to a report transcript. The unexpected result from our study is that this small group of <i>gene-specific</i> translationally regulated mRNAs (the 1-2% of all mRNAs) are mostly repressed in mitosis (indeed several fold more repressed than the 35% decrease that applies to virtually all mRNAs) while few show higher rates of translation. This <i>gene-specific</i> translation repression during mitosis was not previously known and thus is a major new finding of our study."

In fact, in a very recent study, Shuda et al. (published as we submitted our manuscript) examined global cap-dependent versus cap-independent translation in mitosis in detail and found that mitotic translation was almost exclusively cap-dependent. Consistent with this, Stumpf et al. (Mol Cell, 2013) did not find translational upregulation in mitosis for the majority of the mRNAs that were previously thought to be translated in a cap-independent manner (including nucleophosmin, La and vimentin). Our genome-wide analysis is consistent with these recent papers, and suggest that IRES-mediated translation may not be the major driving force that shapes mitotic translation, as thought previously."

Indeed, of the 3 genes <a href=\"#bib41\">Qin and Sarnow (2004)</a> analyzed quantitatively (Nucleophosmin, La and vimentin), only one gene (Vimentin) showed more than 3-fold increase (\u223c4-fold) in translation in mitosis (note-3-fold is the cut-off used in our study).

We do not exclude the possibility that a small subset of mRNAs are translated more efficiently in mitosis due to the presence of IRESes, and have added this statement to the revised manuscript. However, our genome-wide analysis (the first of its kind to accurately quantify both translational activation and repression in mitosis) shows that the dominant effect of <i>gene-specific</i> translational regulation involves translational repression, rather than activation. Thus, previous cases of IRES-dependent translational activation of a few specific mRNAs during mitosis appear to be exceptions rather than the rule for most mRNAs. Furthermore, it is important to note that we have provided a completely independent validation of our study through the use of a single cell, fluorescence-based translation reporter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), as suggested by the reviewer."

For these reasons, we used a direct translation readout of a reporter construct containing the Em1 sequence. While the reporter is not precisely the same mRNA as the native construct, it yielded the same conclusion (a very large translational repression) and thus was in good agreement with the ribosome profiling result. Thus, we feel that these are two independent and reasonable arguments for translational regulation, and thus we would not necessarily apply the word \u201ccircular\u201d to the logic. One argument measures native transcript + an indirect measure translation (ribosome occupancy) and the other measures a reporter construct + a more direct measure of translation (fluorescence readout from the reporter). Both of these experimental strategies yielded very similar quantitative readouts. Given that \u223c1% of genes show translational repression in mitosis, this agreement of these results is unlikely to be spurious.
