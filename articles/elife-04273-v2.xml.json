PepT1 and PepT2, the mammalian proton coupled peptide transporters (POTs), function to assimilate and retain diet-derived peptides and play important roles in drug pharmacokinetics. A key characteristic of the POT family is the mechanism of peptide selectivity, with members able to recognise and transport &gt;8000 different peptides. In this study, we present thermodynamic evidence that in the bacterial POT family transporter PepT<sub>St</sub>, from <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>, at least two alternative transport mechanisms operate to move peptides into the cell. Whilst tri-peptides are transported with a proton:peptide stoichiometry of 3:1, di-peptides are co-transported with either 4 or 5 protons. This is the first thermodynamic study of proton:peptide stoichiometry in the POT family and reveals that secondary active transporters can evolve different coupling mechanisms to accommodate and transport chemically and physically diverse ligands across the membrane."

This suggests that two different transport mechanisms operate from the same binding site, which may account for the wide variety of molecules that can be transported."

This reveals that while the transport of peptides made of three amino acids requires three protons to also be moved through the transporter, the transport of peptides containing two amino acids requires four, or possibly five, protons. This challenges previous findings that these transporters transport one peptide for every proton, and further supports the idea that a single transporter can use more than one method to bind to and transport molecules. Whether other membrane transporters, particularly the human versions of the POT family, share this ability remains an open question."

This can be accomplished through either a symport mechanism, with the solute being moved in the direction of the driving ion, or antiport, where the solute movement is counter to that of the driving ion (<a href=\"#bib25\">Shi, 2013</a>). The ion gradients utilised by secondary active transporters include proton (\u0394\u03bcH<sup>+</sup>), sodium (\u0394\u03bcNa<sup>+</sup>), or chloride (\u0394\u03bcCl<sup>\u2212</sup>) gradients, which are in turn established through the action of the primary ATP driven P-, F-, V-, and A-type ion pumps (<a href=\"#bib34\">Voet and Voet, 2011</a>). A fundamental characteristic of these systems is that, in general, transport is strictly coupled; the movement of solutes and ions is obligatory and one cannot be transported without the other. If these systems were to operate in a decoupled manner, they would act as leaks and dissipate the ion gradients across the membrane, quickly leading to cell death. Given the strict requirement for coupling solute binding and transport to ion movement, the stoichiometry of these mechanisms is normally a fixed ratio. Examples include the <i>Escherichia coli</i> lactose transporter, LacY, which transports lactose in a symport mechanism with one proton (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kaback et al., 2011</a>) and EmrE, the small multidrug extrusion transporter, which moves both monovalent and divalent substrates in a 1:2 drug:proton stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rotem and Schuldiner, 2004</a>)."

Prominent among these are the proton coupled oligopeptide transporters or POTs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hillgren et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). POT family transporters are widely distributed within bacterial, fungal, and plant genomes where they are responsible for the uptake of di- and tri-peptides from the external environment (<a href=\"#bib3\">Daniel et al., 2006</a>). Mammals contain four POT family transporters, PepT1 (SLC15A1), PepT2 (SLC15A2), PHT1 (SLC15A4), and PHT2 (SLC15A3). PepT1 and PepT2 are expressed at the plasma membrane, whereas PHT1 and PHT2 are found in lysosomal membranes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Daniel and Kottra, 2004</a>). Throughout the POT family the transport mechanism and peptide binding site are highly conserved, with bacterial counterparts sharing \u223c80% identity to human PepT1 and PepT2 within their peptide binding sites (<a href=\"#bib29\">Terada and Inui, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Newstead, 2014</a>). All POT family members studied to date transport their substrates into the cell in a coupled symport mechanism, driven by the proton electrochemical gradient. While a number of mutational studies on the mammalian PepT1 and PepT2 transporters address peptide recognition (<a href=\"#bib30\">Terada et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Fei et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Yeung et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Uchiyama et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Luckner and Brandsch, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kulkarni et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Pieri et al., 2009</a>), the question of how many protons are coupled to peptide transport remains unresolved; early studies using Caco-2 cell lines derives a ratio of greater than two protons per peptide (<a href=\"#bib31\">Thwaites et al., 1993</a>). However due to experimental design, narrowing this figure to a more precise stoichiometry was not possible (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kottra et al., 2002</a>). Electrophysiological studies using two electrode voltage clamping (TEVC) in Xenopus oocytes in tandem with radio ligand transport assays on non hydrolysable peptide (D-Phe-L-Gln/Glu/Lys or Gly-Sar) have reported stoichiometry ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 proton:peptide for neutral/basic and acidic di-peptides respectively for PepT1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fei et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Steel et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Chen et al., 1999</a>). Similar experiments on PepT2 have given different ratios either D-Phe-L-ala of 2:1 and for D-Phe-L-Glu 3:1 (Chen JBC 1999) or 1:1 for D-Phe-L-Gln/Glu or Lys (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fei et al., 1999</a>)."

Whereas the di-peptide L-Ala-L-Phe binds in a horizontal position with respect to the plane of the membrane, whilst the tri-peptide L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Ala resides in a vertical orientation and makes subtly different interactions within the binding site. This raised the interesting and to our knowledge unique proposition, that two different transport mechanisms may have evolved within the same binding site as a way to accommodate a diverse library of peptide ligands, &gt;8000 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ito et al., 2013</a>). To address whether PepT<sub>St</sub> could indeed operate using distinct mechanisms to drive di- and tri-peptides, we explored the coupling mechanism between protons and peptide in a reconstituted system, determining the coupling stoichiometries of protons and peptides. We show that whilst tri-peptide import is coupled to three protons, the mechanism for di-peptide import requires at least four and possibly five protons. These results provide further biochemical evidence that POT family transporters do operate via multiple mechanisms for coupling peptide transport to the proton gradient. The ability to couple different numbers of protons to structurally and chemically diverse ligands may explain how the POT family is able to accommodate and transport such a large library of di- and tri-peptides."

Previously published peptide transport assays tend to follow peptide uptake using a radiolabeled peptide substrate. To instead follow proton movement, we monitored the internal pH with the ratiometric pH sensitive fluorophore, pyranine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We first performed a number of control experiments to see whether our system could indeed follow proton coupled peptide transport into a liposome. Acidification of the lumen was only observed in the presence of peptide and a large hyperpolarized (negative inside) membrane potential imposed by adding the potassium ionophore valinomycin in the presence of a K<sup>+</sup> gradient (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We did not see such acidification either in the absence of valinomycin or in the presence of amino acid (alanine) or tetra peptide (Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala), confirming that this transporter is indeed specific for di- and tri-peptide substrates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). PepT<sub>St</sub> has been shown previously to transport Ala\u2013Ala with a 10-fold higher activity than Ala-Ala-Ala as judged by IC<sub>50</sub> values using tritiated Ala\u2013Ala as a reporter (<a href=\"#bib27\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>). We confirmed this 10-fold difference in uptake by using our proton-based assay, which can now report the direct uptake of any transported substrate rather than inferring substrate specificity through inhibition of Ala\u2013Ala (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This assay is also useful to study poor competitors of di-alanine for example, di-lysine where no competition could be observed previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>). Using this assay, we can now observe uptake of this substrate indirectly by monitoring the coupled proton movement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

This voltage, also known as the reversal potential (<math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mi>\u0394</mi><mi>\u03a8</mi></mrow></math>), is independent of the reaction mechanism. Rather, it depends only on the concentrations of protons and substrate and on the coupling stoichiometry with the form: <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><mi>\u0394</mi><mi>\u03a8</mi></mrow></math> = 60{[pH<sub>in</sub> \u2212 pH<sub>out</sub>] \u2212 m/n log ([Pep]<sub>in</sub>/[Pep]<sub>out</sub>)}, where m and n are the stoichiometric coefficients in the chemical reaction above and <math id=\"inf3\"><mrow><mi>\u0394</mi><mi>\u03a8</mi></mrow></math> is in mV (see derivation in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In contrast, voltages corresponding to reversal potentials for stoichiometries of 2:1 and 4:1 produced clearly distinguishable inward and outward fluxes respectively, strongly pointing to a 3:1 stoichiometry for the transporter. A very different combination of proton and peptide gradients, where we now included a proton gradient, also (pH more acidic outside) gave the same stoichiometry of 3:1 for the same tri-alanine peptide (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

However, when we performed experiments with the same gradients as our initial tri-peptide measurements only now with the neutral peptide Ala\u2013Ala, we still observed transport at a voltage of \u221240 mV, where before we saw no net proton flux for tri-alanine. Transport is still also occurring at \u221230 mV which under these conditions would correspond to a proton:peptide stoichiometry of 4:1 and where we saw proton influx for tri-alanine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Therefore, surprisingly, the stoichiometry of protons to peptides in PepT<sub>St</sub> appears to be different for tri-Ala as compared with di-Ala. Further experiments to try to pin down the number of protons being co-transported with di-alanine lead to slightly ambiguous results, as increasing proton:peptide stoichiometries predict decreasing increments in reversal potential. These are, in turn, harder to generate reproducibly with our valinomycin/K<sup>+</sup> system. We performed experiments with voltages set at reversal potentials predicted for symport ratios of 5 and 6 protons:peptide and proton flux was minimal at \u221220 mV (6 protons) but it is hard to be able to fully distinguish. Importantly, the system can still be driven in the opposite direction with higher voltages (0 mV, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Regardless of whether the actual stoichiometry is 5 or 6 protons:peptide, these experiments strongly suggest that the stoichiometry is higher for di-peptides than for tri-peptides. We confirmed this higher ratio for di-peptide transport using the substrate Ala\u2013Phe (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Again transport is clearly observed at a membrane potential at \u221230 mV, so the stoichiometry for di-peptide transport by PepT<sub>St</sub> is greater than four protons, clearly different from that of tri-peptides."

PepT<sub>St</sub> contains six-protonatable side chains within its binding site (Glu 22, 25, 299, 300, 400, and K126, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). All of these with the exception of Glu299 are conserved across the PTR family from bacteria through to mammalian PepT1 and PepT2. Previous biochemical studies have shown that in PepT<sub>St</sub> this non-conserved residue is likely to be involved in structural and/or stability features specific to this protein as mutation of this residue results in no expression of the protein. Glu400 and Lys126 are likely to form a salt bridge that stabilises the outward open confirmation of the transporter, a feature that would be conserved regardless of the substrate. Glu300 has been shown to interact with both a di-peptide and a tri-peptide substrate and therefore likely to be involved in the transport mechanism for both di- and tri-peptides and has been shown to be important for di-alanine transport previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Doki et al., 2013</a>). This leaves Glu22 and Glu25 as candidates for differential effects on di- and tri-peptide transport. Previously these residues have been shown to be important for proton coupling for di-alanine, however, here we also found that mutating either of these residues to alanine yielded proteins unable to catalyse proton coupled tri-alanine transport (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Therefore, despite different proton:peptide stoichiometries are apparently required for di- and tri-alanine transport, all five protonatable side chains within the binding site of PepT<sub>St</sub> are likely to be important for the transport mechanism."

Previous electrophysiological recordings on PepT1 and PepT2 have focused their attention on di-peptide substrates and suggest a 1:1 proton:peptide stoichiometry in PepT1 for neutral peptides and either 1:1 or &gt; in PepT2 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). Recent crystal structures and functional data on a bacterial POT family transporter, PepT<sub>St</sub>, a homologue of PepT1 and PepT2, revealed that peptides could adopt different orientations within the binding site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Whereas tri-alanine was observed adopting a vertical position and coordinated by 4 hydrogen bonds, the di-peptide L-Ala-L-Phe was held in a more horizontal position and coordinated through a more extensive network of interactions involving electrostatic interactions with conserved side chains from the N- and C-terminal bundles (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lyons et al., 2014</a>). This raised the possibility that PepT<sub>St</sub> could transport peptides using two different mechanisms operating within the same binding site and has important implications for understanding proton coupled transport more generally within the POT family."

Assuming that our measurements on two sets of distinct di- and tri-peptides reflect the stoichiometries in general, our new data add to our previous multiple binding mode model by showing that tri-peptides are transported using three protons, whereas di-peptides are transported using four or possibly even five protons per cycle. It is important at this stage to highlight that our experiments cannot discriminate between protons that come through the transporter and those that may come through bound to the peptide. However, even if some protons are being moved on the peptide as opposed to being required to rearrange interaction networks during transport, our results still demonstrate that different numbers of protons are moved during the coupled transport of neutral di- vs tri-peptides, which we ascertain establishes a fundamental difference in the way this protein handles these two ligands."

This could be due to movement of the three protons within the binding site to different side chains, perhaps to help re-orientate the tri-peptide as the transporter transitions through its conformational cycle. Indeed if you overlay the crystal structure of the tri-alanine structure with a model of the outward open structure (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), tri-alanine in this position would obstruct the closing of the intracellular gate through disruption of the intracellular stabilising salt bridge (formed between Lys126 (TM4) and Glu400 (TM10)). Therefore, we suggest that for tri-alanine to be transported across the membrane, it is likely to undergo a change in its vertical binding position, to allow for closure of the transporter."

                                "text": "The question then arises as to the functional role of the protons in the transporter. We have previously identified six-protonatable side chains present in the binding site of PepT<sub>St</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), with all but Glu299 being conserved across the POT family (<a href=\"#bib27\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>). It would be tempting therefore, on the basis of simplicity, to predict that our data suggest only three side chains are protonated during tri-peptide transport, and four/five in di-peptide transport. However, we do not believe this to be the case. Our attempts to systematically remove the protonable side chains Glu22 and Glu25 on TM1, which form part of the conserved ExxERF motif but do not interact with either of the di-peptide or tri-peptide in the crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lyons et al., 2014</a>), resulted in inactive transporters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Previous studies have shown that mutating any of the remaining side chains; Lys126, Glu300, and Glu400 also result in inactive proton coupled transport (<a href=\"#bib27\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>). We conclude from these results that all of the protonatable side chains are required for transport regardless of substrate. However, the observation that tri-peptides can be moved using only three protons delineates the minimal number of de-protonation events that are required to drive the conformational changes that re-orientate the binding site. In this model, the remaining protonatable groups remain proton-bound throughout the transport cycle when tri-peptides are transported. On the basis of the new data presented here, we can add further mechanistic insight into our earlier model for peptide transport that we have summarised in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>. Alternating access within the POT family is physiologically driven by the proton electrochemical gradient, with defined conformational states stabilised through conserved pairs of salt bridges that act to coordinate the opening and closing of the intracellular and extracellular gates (<a href=\"#bib19\">Newstead, 2014</a>). Starting from the outward open conformation the binding site is accessible to the extracellular side of the membrane, and the intracellular gate is closed and stabilised by a possible salt bridge between Lys126 (TM4) and Glu400 (TM10). Functional studies have revealed that in another bacterial POT family transporter, from <i>Geobacillus kaustophilus</i>, GkPOT, that the equivalent glutamate to Glu300 is protonated and may be required to allow the binding of peptide (<a href=\"#bib4\">Doki et al., 2013</a>). Considering the minimal three-proton model for tri-peptide transport we propose, it seems reasonable to suggest that proton transfer from Glu300 to Glu400 during transport may occur to couple closing of the extracellular gate with opening of the intracellular one. This would account for one proton. The other two we suggest may come from Lys126 and either of Glu22 or Glu25. Our evidence is that in previous functional studies we showed that either of these side chains could be mutated to alanine with only a slight reduction in counterflow transport but complete loss of proton coupled peptide uptake (<a href=\"#bib27\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>), behaviour classically used to identify side chains required for proton coupled uptake. In the case of di-peptides, additional deprotonation is clearly required. We conjecture that this is the result of the tighter coordination observed in the di-peptide complex structure compared to that for the tri-peptide (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and maybe one reason why this binding site is so sensitive to mutation in our assays."

Whilst in bacterial, fungi, and mammals POT family homologues are responsible for peptide uptake, in plants this family has evolved to recognise widely diverse molecules, including nitrate, glucosinylates, hormones, and peptides (<a href=\"#bib16\">L\u00e9ran et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28a\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Parker and Newstead, 2014</a>). This may explain why mammals use the POT family homologues PepT1 and PepT2, as coupling peptide transport to the proton gradient appears to facilitate a promiscuous binding site that can adapt to chemically diverse side chain groups more easily than sodium coupled transporters, which require well-defined binding sites for the cation."

The authors used a ratiometric fluorescence dye to record pH changes in liposomes. They demonstrated that the transporter transports protons when there is a voltage difference across the membrane, mediated by K+ and valinomycin. They also found that proton transport depends on the presence of peptides (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The stoichiometry between peptides and protons was determined by finding the voltage at which H+ flux is zero (defined as the reversal potential) at known peptide and proton gradients. By relating the chemical potential difference of the peptide inside and out to the electrochemical driving force of the protons (which will depend on the number of protons per peptide), the stoichiometry (m/n) can be determined from the equation described."

The previous crystal structures of the <i>S. thermophilus</i> PepT had shown that two classes of substrates, neutral di-peptides and tri-peptides, bind in different ways to the transport region. This raised questions about how the transporter, which handles a huge diversity of di- and tripeptides, manage this feat of nonspecificity within and specificity among substrate classes. Now, using an elegant assay in a reconstituted liposome-flux system, the authors show an important difference in H+-peptide stoichiometry between dipeptides (i.e., Ala-Ala) and tripeptides (Ala-Ala-Ala or Ala-Leu-Ala). This implies, under the assumption of strict H+ coupling for both substrate types that substantially separate transport mechanisms have evolved within the same protein. Given that assumption, that is a novel insight."

Although no such specific residues emerged from these mutants, the effort and its \u201cnegative result\u201d is nevertheless worthwhile to report."

The manuscript is properly explicit in stating the basic assumption underlying the stoichiometry measurement: that the transporter is fully, obligatorily coupled for both substrates. It is this assumption that leads to the equation on p 5 for the reversal potential, the zero-flux condition at thermodynamic equilibrium. If this assumption is valid, then all the conclusions offered here follow as the night the day. But what if it isn't? An alternative possibility is that the \u201cless active\u201d dipeptide substrate might show a higher H+/peptide stoichiometry because it is imperfectly coupled, and that 2 protons \u201cslip through\u201d on average for every transport cycle in which 3 protons are actually mechanistically coupled. This would create a nonequilibrium situation in which the coupled protons and the leak protons have different reversal potentials, and the observed zero-flux voltage lies between the two. In such a case of partial slippage; a situation known to exist, for example, in mutants of CLC transporters, the actual mechanism of transport would be identical for both di- and tripeptides, and so it would be invalid to tout this as an example of \u201cone transporter, two mechanisms.\u201d"
