In contrast, irregular-spiking (IS) interneurons are remarkable for the intrinsic variability of their spike timing, which can synchronize amongst IS cells via specific gap junctions. Here, we have studied the biophysical mechanisms of this irregular spiking in mice, and how IS cells fire in the context of synchronous network oscillations. Using patch-clamp recordings, artificial dynamic conductance injection, pharmacological analysis and computational modeling, we show that spike time irregularity is generated by a nonlinear dynamical interaction of voltage-dependent sodium and fast-inactivating potassium channels just below spike threshold, amplifying channel noise. This <i>active irregularity</i> may help IS cells synchronize with each other at gamma range frequencies, while resisting synchronization to lower input frequencies."

In contrast, irregular-spiking (IS) interneurons are remarkable for the intrinsic variability of their spike timing, which can synchronize amongst IS cells via specific gap junctions. Here, we have studied the biophysical mechanisms of this irregular spiking in mice, and how IS cells fire in the context of synchronous network oscillations. Using patch-clamp recordings, artificial dynamic conductance injection, pharmacological analysis and computational modeling, we show that spike time irregularity is generated by a nonlinear dynamical interaction of voltage-dependent sodium and fast-inactivating potassium channels just below spike threshold, amplifying channel noise. This <i>active irregularity</i> may help IS cells synchronize with each other at gamma range frequencies, while resisting synchronization to lower input frequencies."

When stimulated by input signals of a constant size, neurons generally respond with regular patterns of spiking leading to rhythmical brain activity. However, neurons known as irregular spiking interneurons are unique: the relationship between the input they receive and whether or not they produce a spike appears to be random.

In contrast, the nature of intrinsically irregular firing has resisted elucidation, and appears to be a more complex phenomenon. Irregularity of firing in neurons can arise because of fluctuating patterns of synaptic input due to spontaneous activity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Destexhe et al., 2001</a>), or from stochastic fluctuations in the release of transmitter (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ribrault et al., 2011</a>). In some regions of the brain, though, certain types of neuron show strikingly high irregularity of firing even when isolated in vitro (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cauli et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Grace and Bunney, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ascoli et al., 2008</a>). The cellular mechanisms of such intrinsic irregularity are unknown, though the\u00a0stochastic gating of the ion channels involved in spike generation seems likely to play a part. Effective chaos in the nonlinear dynamics of the voltage-dependent ion channels involved in spike generation could also contribute to irregular patterns of membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib16\">Durstewitz and Gabriel, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fan and Chay, 1994</a>)."

Within the neural circuitry of the neocortex are various types of inhibitory interneuron, several of which have been implicated in the generation of distinct synchronous oscillations at various frequencies from slow (&lt;1 Hz) to very fast (&gt;100 Hz), such as the theta (4\u201310 Hz), beta (10\u201330 Hz) and gamma (30\u201380 Hz) oscillations (Buzs\u00e1ki<a href=\"#bib8\">, 2006</a>). For example, the fast-spiking (FS, parvalbumin-expressing, basket morphology) cell network has a crucial role in the emergence of the gamma rhythm (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cardin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hasenstaub et al., 2005</a>). Recent evidence suggests the possibility of a similar specific role for the low-threshold-spiking (LTS, somatostatin-positive, Martinotti) cell network in lower frequency theta or beta rhythms (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fanselow et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vierling-Claassen et al., 2010</a>). One type of interneuron, however, is distinguished by its intrinsically irregular repetitive firing, showing a broad, apparently random dispersion of its interspike intervals, as opposed to bursting, even when pharmacologically disconnected from any synaptic input. These irregular-spiking (IS) neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cauli et al., 1997</a>) seem to have both a distinctive mechanism of spike timing control, and possibly a unique role during synchronous network oscillations."

These cells express CCK, VIP and 5HT3a receptors (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sugino et al., 2006</a>). They are concentrated in layer 2 (<a href=\"#bib41\">L\u00f3pez-Bendito et al., 2004</a>), and derive primarily from the caudal ganglionic eminence during development (<a href=\"#bib41\">L\u00f3pez-Bendito et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). They connect specifically to each other by gap junctions and mutually inhibitory synaptic connections, which together enable precisely-synchronized irregular firing (<a href=\"#bib23\">Galarreta et al., 2004</a>). Their wide axonal arborizations through many layers of the cortex and inhibition of pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Galarreta et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2008</a>) suggest that they could exert a powerful influence on the network. Another distinctive property of these cells is their expression of CB1 cannabinoid receptors, which can suppress their inhibitory output to pyramidal cells, following depolarization of the postsynaptic cell (<a href=\"#bib24\">Galarreta et al., 2008</a>). Although they make up a large proportion of inhibitory interneurons in superficial layers, they have received much less attention than other classes of interneuron, such as FS and LTS cells."

Using a combination of patch-clamp recording in slices of somatosensory cortex, time series analysis and computational modeling, we show that IS neurons generate robust, intrinsically irregular firing by nonlinear interactions of voltage-dependent currents and channel noise. The degree of irregularity is tuned by the level of a fast-inactivating potassium conductance, and voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channel openings contribute a high level of voltage noise at threshold. The effect of these mechanisms is that these cells reject synchronization to a low frequency (10 Hz), while synchronizing effectively to higher, gamma frequencies, a property which could give them a prominent role in gating local cortical gamma oscillations."

Over long periods of continuous stimulation, the distribution of interspike intervals was skewed and unimodal, and could be reasonably well-fitted by a gamma function (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Irregularity was quantified as the coefficient of variation of interspike intervals or CV(ISI), the ratio of the standard deviation of intervals to their mean (see Materials and methods), which is equal to 1 for a Poisson point process, and 0 for a perfectly periodic process. CV(ISI) was reduced at higher stimulus levels and firing frequencies, and was quite variable from cell to cell, but ranged from 0.1 (fairly regular) to 0.6 at a firing frequency of \u224810 Hz (CV<sub>10\u00a0Hz</sub> = 0.28 \u00b1 0.15, n = 45). The irregularity persisted in the presence of blockers of ionotropic glutamate and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and is therefore presumably generated intrinsically, rather than by noisy synaptic input. The intrinsic nature of the IS was confirmed in primary cultures of dissociated <i>Gad2</i> neurons, which displayed a similar spiking pattern, despite simpler morphology and reduced connectivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e,f</a>)."

                                "text": "To characterize the dynamics of irregular spiking, we first examined return maps of interspike intervals \u2013 scatter plots of each interval against its predecessor \u2013 which displayed no discernible fine structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>). We therefore looked at the predictability of higher-order sequences of intervals using recurrence plots (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eckmann et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Marwan et al., 2007</a>). First, sequences of interspike intervals were embedded \u2013 that is, translated into all sub-sequences of length <i>m</i>, the embedding dimension \u2013 each of which defines a point in <i>m</i>-dimensional embedding space, and can be thought of as a piece of 'recent history'. For example, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> (top) illustrates two similar embedding points of dimension <i>m\u00a0</i>=\u00a03 occurring within two different interval sequences. Similarity of dynamical state is measured by proximity in this space (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, bottom), and this can be generalized to any <i>m</i>. A cross-recurrence plot of two sequences of intervals, A and B, for example two successive spiking responses to an identical step current stimulus, is a matrix in which element (<i>x,y</i>) has a value representing the distance between the <i>x</i>th embedding point of A and the <i>y</i>th embedding point of B (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eckmann et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Marwan et al., 2007</a>) (see Materials and methods for further details). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a> shows an example in which Euclidean distance in embedding space is represented by color, so that close recurrences show up as colored dots on a gray background. Diagonal lines of slope one, many examples of which can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>, indicate periods when the trajectory of one time series evolves similarly to the trajectory of the other. Examples of four different recurrent ISI sequence 'motifs', identified from the recurrence plot in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>, are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>. Recurrence can be quantified as follows. Applying a threshold to the cross-recurrence plot, so that element (x,y) = 1 if the distance between <b>A<sub>x</sub></b> and <b>B<sub>y</sub></b> is less than a threshold neighborhood size \u03b5 (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>), or zero otherwise, gives a binary cross-recurrence plot, in which the density of 1\u2019s is defined as the degree of recurrence, and the fraction of these which lie within diagonals of length 2 or greater is defined as the degree of determinism. Randomly shuffling the time series before embedding destroys significant recurrence and determinism (allowing statistical testing of their significance (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and Materials and methods). We calculated cross-recurrence plots between successive pairs of trials (5\u201330 s in duration), omitting the first 450 ms of firing in each trial to exclude initial adaptation, for 10 neurons which showed long periods of stationary responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>), at average firing frequencies between 4 and 17 Hz. Using a standard sequence size or embedding dimension <i>m</i> = 4, and a neighborhood size (\u03b5) of one standard deviation of the ISIs, we found that in five of ten cells, both recurrence and determinism were significant (p&lt;0.05, z-test), while only recurrence was significant in a further two cells, and in the three remaining cells, neither recurrence nor determinism were significant. See <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a> for details. Note that, unlike the related technique of nonlinear prediction (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kantz and Schreiber, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sprott, 2003</a>), the detection of significant recurrence and dynamical determinism by recurrence plot quantification is less confounded by nonstationarity, and relatively insensitive to the exact choice of <i>m</i> and \u03b5. Thus, irregular sequences of spikes generated during a constant stimulus in about half of IS neurons show recurrent, correlated sequences of four or more successive intervals. It seems likely that the concerted action of voltage-dependent ion channel populations would be involved in producing such determinism. We found similar recurrence and determinism in a conductance-based biophysical model of these cells, described below, when applying the same analysis procedure to its spike trains (Figure 6, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We noted that those cells that failed to show significant recurrence and determinism had particularly strong voltage noise in their interspike intervals (not shown)."

Clearly, one potentially relevant phenomenon is the noisy fluctuation in the\u00a0membrane potential which switches on above \u221250 mV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). We found that these fluctuations depended on voltage-gated sodium channels, since they were eliminated by applying tetrodotoxin (TTX; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, n = 6 cells). To further investigate the unitary properties of voltage-gated sodium channels, we carried out cell-attached recordings in somatic patches. Characteristic \u224820 pS inward openings were observed, concentrated soon after the beginning of the depolarization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), with an extrapolated reversal potential of about +120 mV positive to the resting potential, as expected for single voltage-gated sodium channels (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sigworth and Neher, 1980</a>). We also observed frequent late openings of the same channel amplitude, up to 100 ms following +40 mV depolarizations from rest, (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c and d</a>, in 4 out of 5 patches containing transient Na channels). Whole-cell recordings further confirmed the presence of a non-inactivating, TTX sensitive inward current, evoked in response to a slowly depolarizing ramp (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>, prominent in 11/13 cells), when K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were reduced with TEA (2 mM), 4-AP (2 mM) and Cd<sup>2+</sup> (200 \u03bcM). Similar 'persistent' sodium current (NaP) and channel openings have been described in many neurons and excitable cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kiss, 2008</a>). Thus, stochastic, voltage-dependent gating of sodium channels could be involved in generating irregularity of firing. Sodium-channel-driven subthreshold noise has been observed in other cell types (<a href=\"#bib65\">White et al., 1998</a>), but without appearing to produce the high level of firing irregularity observed in IS cells at \u224810 Hz firing frequencies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alonso and Klink, 1993</a>). The deterministic recurrence of the interspike intervals suggests that another active mechanism might also be involved."

However, neither blockers of calcium-activated potassium channels (iberiotoxin and apamin) nor intracellular perfusion of a fast calcium buffer (BAPTA) diminished irregularity of firing (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and we concluded that intracellular calcium signaling is not centrally involved in the dynamics of intrinsic irregularity. We therefore next examined the voltage-dependent potassium currents, which are of key importance in determining action potential generation and shape (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bean, 2007</a>). In particular, we focussed on those whose voltage-dependence of gating might allow dynamical interaction with the sodium channels."

                                "text": "Whole-cell voltage-clamp of the outward currents in response to families of step depolarizations revealed an early transient outward or A-type potassium current (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>), which could be isolated by applying a pre-pulse protocol (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amarillo et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">Maffie et al., 2013</a>) in the presence of 5 mM TEA to remove slower K<sup>+</sup> currents (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a09). Fits of the voltage-dependence of the peak conductance and of the steady-state inactivation of this transient potassium conductance (<i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i>) showed that activation and inactivation curves overlapped around the threshold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a018 cells for inactivation, n\u00a0=\u00a036 cells for activation), peaking within 1\u20132 ms, and inactivating over about 20\u201330 ms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>, top). Additionally, this fast inactivating outward current recovered from inactivation with a time constant of around 40 ms at \u221270 mV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>, bottom). These properties are not consistent with Kv1 channels (the current was insensitive to 1 \u03bcM \u03b1-dendrotoxin, n\u00a0=\u00a04, not shown), including Kv1.4 (recovery from inactivation in the range of milliseconds rather than seconds, see <a href=\"#bib66\">Wickenden et al., 1999</a>), nor with channels from the Kv3 family (transient currents were TEA insensitive, see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The gating properties closely resemble those of Kv4-family voltage-dependent potassium channels in pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Birnbaum et al., 2004</a>), and this was further supported by its sensitivity to 4-AP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a> top, n\u00a0=\u00a06) and the specific Kv4.2/4.3 blocker phrixotoxin (PhTX; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a> bottom, n\u00a0=\u00a07), which produced a partial, reversible block of 55% at a concentration of 5 \u00b5M. We fitted conventional Hodgkin-Huxley type models to the voltage-step responses of this current (see Materials and methods), and estimated a peak transient conductance at 0 mV (<i>g<sub>max0</sub></i>, see Materials and methods) of 22.37 \u00b1 14.41 nS (<i>n</i> = 8 cells, mean \u00b1 SD). This current would be expected to delay the rise of membrane potential just before spike initiation. Although the membrane potential leading into spikes was generally highly fluctuating, averaging the waveform of hundreds of action potential, aligned with the fastest point of the upstroke, consistently showed the presence of a clear dip or inflection in the rising phase, about 10 ms before the start of the fast upstroke (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>), which we attribute to this current. There was also a high density of single channel currents in some cell-attached patches (<i>n\u00a0</i>=\u00a07) with similar activation and inactivation properties (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g and h</a>), implying some clustering in the membrane, as previously described for Kv4 channels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alonso and Widmer, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jinno et al., 2005</a>). The fast and small-amplitude single channel openings in these recordings were not well-resolved, but appeared to comprise step transitions corresponding to a single channel chord conductance of about 10\u201312 pS (assuming <i>E<sub>K</sub></i> \u2248\u221290 mV). The single channel conductance of Kv4 channels is not extensively-characterized, but reports vary from \u22485 pS to \u224820 pS in low potassium external solutions, and it is sensitive both to external potassium concentration and to association with accessory proteins such as KChIPs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Holmquist et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cooper and Shrier, 1989</a>). Thus, overall, the transient potassium conductance recorded at the soma strongly resembles reported descriptions of Kv4-mediated conductance."

Artificial conductance injection of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> was sufficient to modulate the spiking irregularity of intrinsically irregular <i>Gad2</i> interneurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013c</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). When negative <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i>\u00a0was injected, i.e. <i>subtracting</i> from the dynamics of the native conductance in these cells (as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a> for voltage clamp currents), we saw a striking regularization of firing in the range of frequency examined, as well as a reduction in the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude. On the other hand, injecting positive <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> induced an increase in the irregularity of firing, accompanied by a more prominent subthreshold membrane potential fluctuation between spikes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). The effect of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> on CV(ISI) was consistent especially at lower firing frequencies (e.g. 10 Hz, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a042 cells), and it was even more evident when the total <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> injected was normalized to the capacitance of each cell, which is proportional to its plasma membrane area (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>). Pharmacological block of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> by 4-AP or phrixotoxin gave a similar result to negative conductance injection, reducing irregularity of firing (See <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We constructed a conductance-based biophysical model, in which the key <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> and NaP conductances could be modeled either as stochastic or deterministic elements. A two-compartment model was used, comprising a somatic compartment which contained voltage-dependent conductances, linked to a passive dendritic compartment. The dendritic compartment was included in order to capture, in a simplified way, the extended spatial aspect of the cell morphology. Similar to a widely-used model of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Erisir et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gouwens et al., 2010</a>), the soma included Kv1 and Kv3 voltage-dependent potassium conductances\u00a0and a sodium conductance. To this, however, was added a <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> conductance based on the voltage-clamp findings above, and a persistent sodium conductance (NaP). NaP and <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> were modeled either deterministically or stochastically with a dynamic noise variance (see Materials and methods for details)."

In a three-dimensional subspace of the (8-dimensional) phase space of the model, displaying the activation variable of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> as <i>x</i>, the membrane potential as <i>y</i>, and the sodium inactivation variable as <i>z</i>, some of the dynamical structure underlying this behaviour can be seen (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The subthreshold oscillations correspond to variable numbers of circuits around an unstable-amplitude cycle in one region of phase space, before the system escapes into the upstroke of a spike. Long pauses correspond to a transition to another critically slow region of phase space where <i>h, m</i>, and <i>V</i> remain at an almost fixed point, while Kv1 activation (<i>n</i>) slowly subsides, eventually leading to an escape from this region, either directly into a spike, or into a period of subthreshold oscillations. Thus, this set of conductances gives two dynamical mechanisms for generating irregular interspike intervals: variable numbers of circuits of unstable amplitude subthreshold oscillations, and long pauses in a slow region of phase space. The activation of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> is seen to vary considerably for different spikes (note the spread in values of <i>m<sub>Kt</sub></i> in the afterhyperpolarization in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>)."

The subthreshold noise amplitude is highly dependent on the stochastic <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i>, since it is greatly reduced if <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> is deterministic (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). It is only slightly reduced if NaP is deterministic, but greatly reduced if all voltage-gated sodium conductance is removed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>, 'TTX' - right hand side). This implies that subthreshold fluctuations are dominated by <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i>-driven stochastic fluctuations which are strongly amplified by the voltage-gated sodium conductance \u2013 both are required. The greater importance of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> noise over NaP noise is largely due to its much longer correlation time (10 ms versus 1 ms), which means that <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> noise is much less filtered by the membrane time constant. Thus, these strong subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations appear to be actively-amplified channel noise, somewhat like noise-driven subthreshold oscillations, as described in entorhinal stellate neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dorval and White, 2005</a>). This result suggests that, although the fit of the subthreshold membrane potential noise variance by the 'voltage-clamped' channel noise of NaP and <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> channels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, see Materials and methods) appears to describe the onset of this noise reasonably well, the numbers of channels are probably overestimated, as the powerful active amplification of fluctuations is not taken into account."

As the amount of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> in the membrane is increased to 12 nS, a region of structurally-stable variability is created for firing frequencies up to 20\u201330 Hz, above which frequency the CV(ISI) subsides, as seen in recordings, in both deterministic (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>) and stochastic (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>) forms of the model.

However, the mechanism of irregularity proposed here depends on the intrinsic dynamics and noise sources within individual cells. It seems possible that the impact of fluctuations generated within individual cells could be diluted when cells are connected in an electrical network. Therefore, we simulated small networks of symmetrically-coupled stochastic IS neurons. In a 5-cell network, firing became\u00a0highly synchronous as gap junction conductance was increased, as seen in the sharp central peak of cross-correlation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). However, CV(ISI) was maintained at the same level as for uncoupled cells, even with strong coupling and complete synchrony (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>).

                                "text": "The intrinsic irregularity of firing of IS neurons, which is distinctive amongst the cell types of the cortical network, raises the question of what these neurons do, particularly in the context of the regular firing which underlies organized oscillations in many frequency bands (<a href=\"#bib7\">Busz\u00e1ki and Draguhn, 2004</a>). This particular type of IS neuron directly inhibits pyramidal neurons, and it has been suggested that it might promote asynchronous firing and thereby resist synchronous oscillations (<a href=\"#bib24\">Galarreta et al., 2008</a>). In order to test how these cells integrate periodic inputs, we examined their ability to synchronize their spikes to rhythmic oscillation in a naturalistic stimulus consisting of several conductance components: a stationary, noisy AMPA receptor-type excitatory conductance and an oscillating (10 Hz or 40 Hz) GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-type shunting inhibitory conductance, combined with simultaneously adding or subtracting <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> using dynamic-clamp (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>). <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a> shows an example of an IS cell subjected to an elevation of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> (+3.57 nS <i>g<sub>max0</sub></i>). This depresses the synchrony of spikes to the\u00a0<i>g<sub>GABA</sub></i> rhythm (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b<i>ii,iii</i></a>) across the range of oscillation amplitudes tested. Conversely, subtraction of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> from another cell (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>) enhanced synchrony over a wide range of oscillation amplitudes. These striking effects of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> on synchrony to 10 Hz inputs are not observed, however, for 40 Hz input (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>, summary statistics for the whole set of cells at both frequencies are shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>). Thus modulation of irregularity of IS neurons by the level of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>) appears to determine their ability to synchronize to oscillatory inhibition, and the dynamics of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> are such that it can counteract 10 Hz but not 40 Hz rhythms. Rejection of synchronization results from the intrinsically irregular dynamics at lower frequencies, around 10 Hz, while resonance with a noise-obscured subthreshold oscillation (whose frequency in the deterministic model is 28 Hz) could contribute to the stronger\u00a0synchronization at higher frequencies. Thus the native <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> of IS cells allows them to resist synchrony to lower network frequencies such as 10 Hz, while complying readily with higher, gamma frequency rhythms. This could have the effect of destabilizing lower frequency network oscillations while helping to stabilize higher-frequency rhythms, and help to determine the times of onset and offset of organized gamma-frequency firing in the network."

Inducible in vivo genetic fate mapping (<a href=\"#bib45\">Miyoshi and Fishell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Miyoshi et al., 2010</a>) has been used to show that these IS interneurons originate from the caudal ganglionic eminence relatively late in development (E16), express 5HT3a receptors, VIP and calretinin, and form about 10% of CGE-derived interneurons, which dominate the more superficial layers of cortex and comprise about 30% of all cortical interneurons.

In contrast, we found that there was both significant recurrence and determinism, i.e. predictability, in sequences of spike intervals, in about half of the cells examined (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We propose that this predictability is linked to the dynamics of a prominent low-threshold fast-inactivating voltage-gated potassium conductance interacting with voltage-dependent sodium conductance, including a persistent fraction, which enhances the activation of sodium channels around AP threshold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Evidence for this was the sensitivity of membrane fluctuations to TTX, the strong modulation of irregularity by injecting artificial inactivating K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and the ability to reproduce this phenomenon in a biophysical model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>)."

Not only does its fast recovery from inactivation (\u224840 ms) exclude the other main candidate, Kv1.4, but the current was partially blocked by PhTX, and had a\u00a0weak voltage dependence for activation and inactivation kinetics, which are known properties of Kv4-mediated currents. IS cells in this same GFP mouse model have been shown to express high levels of Kv4.2 (kcnd2) mRNA, higher than in a population of pyramidal cells and seven times higher than in a population of fast-spiking interneurons (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sugino et al., 2006</a>), but only very low levels of Kv1.4 (kcna4) transcripts. The kinetics and voltage dependence of activation and inactivation also match well those described for Kv4.1/4.2 in pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Birnbaum et al., 2004</a>).

This suggests that normal morphology and circuit formation in development are not required for the irregularity. It is possible that the relatively high mature input resistance of IS neurons (331 M\u03a9), compared to other types of interneuron could directly lead to greater variability, since single-channel voltage noise should be bigger. However, we found that when we injected an intense (2 nS) static shunting conductance, reversing at \u221270 mV, near to the resting potential \u2013 effectively greatly reducing input resistance, the action potential is reduced in amplitude, and afterhyperpolarizations and interspike membrane potential fluctuations are strongly diminished, but irregularity is not reduced (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Likewise, adding the artificial K<sup>+</sup> conductance, which also decreases input resistance, caused increased, not decreased firing variability. This indicates that irregularity is produced by a more complex dynamical mechanism, driven partially by stochastic channel opening, but also dependent on the nonlinearity of the transient K<sup>+</sup>conductance."

Both these mechanisms exist over a fairly wide range of values of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> conductance density and stimulus level (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), but depend on the presence of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i>. The high irregularity and variability of the purely deterministic form of the model is suggestive of deterministic chaos, although a rigorous proof of chaos in the model would require for example proof of a positive Lyapunov exponent, and is beyond the scope of this study. At the same time, however, it is clear that significant dynamical noise must be involved to some extent in the irregularity, as a result of the single-channel characteristics of the main voltage-dependent channels involved. ISI distributions in IS neurons appear to be shaped by the single-channel current fluctuations around AP\u00a0threshold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>), both of sodium channels including persistent ones, and\u00a0of <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> channels. Adding noise in the model, which mimics the single-channel activity of these channels around the\u00a0AP\u00a0threshold, realistically obscures the regularity of the subthreshold oscillation, and leads to ISI distributions very similar to those observed experimentally (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel a). While still clearly preserving the <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i>-induced region of high-CV firing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>), the addition of noise changes the unnaturally high CV(ISI) of the deterministic model (\u22481) to a value compatible with the experiments (\u22480.3). Thus, we believe that the interaction of both elements, the nonlinear deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations and the single-channel dynamical noise is needed for an adequate description of irregular spiking. Both the deterministic and stochastic components of the model have measurable biophysical parameters."

For example, a bifurcation analysis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Golomb et al., 2007</a>) of an FS cell model, incorporating different levels of slowly-inactivating potassium current (<i>I<sub>d</sub></i>, probably corresponding to Kv1 channels) showed that higher levels of this current can produce 'stuttering' behavior associated with subthreshold oscillations, as also seen experimentally in FS neurons (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tateno et al., 2004</a>). Dispersion of interspike intervals produced by variations in amplitude of subthreshold oscillations of a much higher frequency (100\u2013150 Hz) characterized in spinal motoneurons has been termed 'mixed-mode' oscillation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Manuel et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">Iglesias et al., 2011</a>). Noise-induced switching between a fixed point and a spiking limit cycle has been shown to produce high irregularity in the Hodgkin-Huxley model (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rowat, 2007</a>). Recently, Stiefel et al. suggested that fast-activating K<sup>+</sup> currents could promote this kind of switching behavior in IS neurons, leading to high irregularity (<a href=\"#bib61\">Stiefel et al., 2013</a>). Although the mechanism that we propose here is both more specific and more complex, the basic necessity for an interaction between noise and strong nonlinearity assisted by fast K<sup>+</sup> channels is consistent with these studies. Interestingly, A-type potassium and NaP currents have also been implicated in the generation of theta-frequency (5\u201310 Hz) membrane potential oscillations in hippocampal interneurons (<a href=\"#bib47\">Morin et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">Skinner, 2012</a>), possibly through the dynamical mechanism of 'critical slowing', in which the amplitude of noise-driven fluctuations grows near a bifurcation. This may also be relevant in IS neuron membrane potential fluctuations, and further studies of their sensitivity to noise near AP\u00a0threshold would be merited."

First, it is an energetically-favorable way to generate high spike interval irregularity in individual cells, while minimizing unnecessary membrane potential fluctuation, because fluctuations switch on sharply just below AP threshold, and their active amplification makes them highly effective at controlling spike timing. Second, IS cells are linked to each other in a specific gap-junction-coupled network, and also inhibit each other through GABA<sub>A</sub>\u00a0receptor-mediated\u00a0synapses (<a href=\"#bib23\">Galarreta et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2008</a>). This would be expected to enhance the local synchrony of irregular firing (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gouwens et al., 2010</a>), potentially greatly increasing its\u00a0impact on network activity. The partly active, deterministic nature of irregularity and the subthreshold dynamics would help to coordinate the sources of irregularity in different cells, via current flow through gap junctions. Examining the synchronization of ensembles of stochastically-modeled IS neurons connected through gap junctions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c,d</a>), we found that even with high gap-junctional coupling and resultant complete synchrony of firing, irregularity is maintained just as high as in isolated neurons. This non-trivial result implies that the network of IS neurons can indeed fire with both high irregularity and precise synchrony."

It may also enhance STDP-based learning (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christodoulou and Cleanthous, 2011</a>), and could be important in decision-making and generation of spontaneous choices. The coupled network of IS neurons could also control initiation and termination of periods of synchronous regular oscillations, consistent with the rejection of synchronization to low-frequency rhythms that\u00a0we observed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), which was enhanced by the\u00a0addition of artificial <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i>."

It is a thorough and detailed analysis made for a neuronal type showing how particular ion channels interact to control spiking patterns. The authors use a genetically altered mouse model to identify a specific type of cortical interneuron that is localized in layer 2 of the cortex and shows an unusual irregularly spiking phenotype, quite different from the better-known fast-spiking phenotype. The work is especially notable as the authors not only characterize some of the cell's biophysical characteristics, but they also create a model and use dynamic clamp to explore the irregularity mechanism and its potential role. These studies especially underlie the importance of determining biophysical specifics of particular cell types and not only doing fits to a generic set of conductances."

Ever since the classic papers by Connor and Stevens, previous analyses of the functional role of Kv4-mediated A-type potassium current have emphasized its role in enabling highly regular low-frequency firing, completely opposite to the critical role in enabling irregular firing that is discovered here. The authors use modeling to find that this mechanism confers on the neurons the ability to decrease synchronization at frequencies below 20 Hz, while permitting synchronization at higher (gamma band) frequencies, thus giving the neurons interesting network properties. The detailed analysis of how Kv4 transient A-type potassium current interacts with subthreshold persistent sodium current to produce irregularity of firing is very nicely done, comprising a detailed experimental characterization of the voltage-dependent and kinetic properties of the two conductance, use of that information in dynamic clamp experiments -which include a demonstration that the kinetics and voltage-dependence of the A-type current are well-enough characterized to allow subtraction of current, rarely attempted (or rigorously tested) in dynamic clamp experiments \u2013 and computer modeling that includes the stochastic behavior of the channels."

The reader needs some help in following the thread of the logic. In any event, the result is that the noise is caused by the stochastic opening of ion channels, as in other neurons that fire more deterministically, and is no larger than in those neurons. At the end of this section we are invited to dismiss this noise as the cause of the irregular firing. Noise will appear again later, but it will not be required for irregular firing. Of course, at this point in the paper the reader does not know this."

Data about Kv4 channels are then given, without any reference to their effect on irregularity. Blockers of Kv4 are used to study the current, but their effect on irregularity are not described. In fact, the effects of those blockers (4-AP or phrixotoxin) on irregularity of firing will never be presented. Why not? Certainly the authors have this information."

The description of the embedding dimension is unnecessarily confusing. From the beginning, when the authors are describing \"two time series, A and B\", it is unclear what these are. The time series are really series of spike times. Why not call them that? It would be much easier and much more interesting for neuroscientists. Are time series A and B spike times from two cells or only one? There is no indication. Are they the subsets of spike times from the same cell? The answers to these questions may seem obvious to the authors but they are not obvious to the readers, and they are essential for understanding the cross-recurrence plots. After they are understood, do the authors think that the reader will get some information from studying the cross-recurrence plots? If so, exactly what should they glean from them? Do they mean that some specific sequences of interspike intervals occur more often than expected by chance? If so, what kind of sequences are they? This figure is important, but as it is, it doesn't really add much to the paper from a reader's point of view. Later in the paper, a model will be presented that tends to fire in a particular set of preferred sequences. If this analysis gave us a first look at this, in the form of particular kinds of sequences that recur at higher than chance level, it would contribute strongly to the flow of the logic."

This is a key experimental part of the paper, and makes the case for the Kv4-like current as essential for irregularity. This part of the paper gets only an extremely brief description in the Results section despite its importance for the argument. And there is a little problem with it. Whereas adding the Kv4-like current was very effective at making the cell more irregular, deleting it was almost completely ineffective. Although the effect at -8.7 nS was apparently statistically significant, it is really a tiny change in regularity, and the cells' CV showed no systematic decrease over the range of negative conductances used. The test claims that the negative conductance produced a \"striking regularization of firing\", but this is not evident in the group measurements in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>. There is apparently a regularization in the example shown in A and B. The change in CV is unconvincing in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>. There are a little cluster of points at -0.1 nS/pF that are lower than the others, but in general, for points at conductances less than 0.2 nS/pF, it looks as though the removal of A current did not reduce CV. This is important for the argument, as the previous section did not show a change in regularity with Kv4 blockers. In the end, there is no strong evidence presented for the key point, which is that the natural level of Kv4 current is necessary for the irregularity."

Neurons have intrinsic noise, caused by the stochastic nature of ion channels, but the noise is relatively small and most cells fire in an almost deterministic way when the synaptic input is removed. Of course, chaotic firing has been demonstrated in realistic models of neurons (e.g. Canavier, Baxter, Clark and Byrne, J. Neurophysiol 1993, 69:2252-2257), but it is rare for authors to claim that irregularity is caused by chaos.

Adding the Kv1 channels to the model introduces pauses in firing that increase the CV. The model also shows subthreshold oscillations that also act to produce long ISIs, but these are of more variable duration because the oscillation occurs near threshold and is unstable. Every transit through the subthreshold oscillation provides an opportunity for another action potential, and this can produce repeating sequences in firing like those I guess are being detected in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> (although not sure because those sequences were never described). It is important that this phenomenon is independent of the presence of noise. The authors don't say so explicitly, but the model can clearly produce irregular firing via chaotic transitions between pauses, spiking, and unstable periodic orbits. In fact, the noise does not increase the irregularity, but rather decreases the range of parameters at which it is seen, as shown by comparing the extent of the red regions in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and B. That figure also shows that the addition of noisy channels reduces the effect of Kv4 (gt) on CV."

Are time series A and B spike times from two cells or only one? There is no indication. Are they the subsets of spike times from the same cell? The answers to these questions may seem obvious to the authors but they are not obvious to the readers, and they are essential for understanding the cross-recurrence plots.

This is a key experimental part of the paper, and makes the case for the Kv4-like current as essential for irregularity. This part of the paper gets only an extremely brief description in the Results section despite its importance for the argument. And there is a little problem with it. Whereas adding the Kv4-like current was very effective at making the cell more irregular, deleting it was almost completely ineffective. Although the effect at -8.7 nS was apparently statistically significant, it is really a tiny change in regularity, and the cells' CV showed no systematic decrease over the range of negative conductances used. The test claims that the negative conductance produced a \"striking regularization of firing\", but this is not evident in the group measurements in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>. There is apparently a regularization in the example shown in A and B. The change in CV is unconvincing in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>. There are a little cluster of points at -0.1 nS/pF that are lower than the others, but in general, for points at conductances less than 0.2 nS/pF, it looks as though the removal of A current did not reduce CV. This is important for the argument, as the previous section did not show a change in regularity with Kv4 blockers.

However, we do not agree that this is a minimal or unclear effect. Firstly, the measurements as shown in original <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, for -8.7 nS injection, gave a clear and significant reduction. The data for the -4.35 nS histogram bar were not significant, but there was a relatively low n for that set of measurements (n = 7). In the original <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, we used data from only one of the three <math id=\"inf63\"><mrow><msub><mi>g</mi><mrow><mi>K</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>conductance definitions (model 3). In the new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, we have incorporated data from the two other models as well (n=42 cells), and instead tested the lumped negative and positive conductance injections against control. Both results are significant, with <i>p</i>&lt;1.6 X 10<sup>-8</sup> for negative injections, and <i>p</i>&lt;9.8 X 10<sup>-16</sup> for positive injections. The basis for this can be seen in a clearly shifted set of points for the negative injection case (red points). In a new supplementary <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, we now show several examples of the changes in spike train pattern induced by both negative and positive <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> injection. In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, plotting the relative change in CV(ISI) versus normalised conductance injected, the trend is clear across both positive and negative conductance injections, and we have now added a linear regression fit to emphasise this. The apparent cluster of points at \u2248-0.1 nS/pF is real \u2013 all of those cells indeed showed a relatively big reduction in CV(ISI) for what turned out (after normalisation) to be a relatively modest negative injection. Note that there is less scope to reduce CV(ISI) experimentally by negative conductance injection than to increase it by positive conductance injection, because we are limited in the amount of negative conductance that we can inject without creating instability. Also, as irregularity is reduced by cancelling <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i>, other sources of variability may start to dominate. Despite this, we were able to cancel almost half of the native <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> (8.7 nS of 22 nS), and this had a significant effect in reducing CV(ISI). Therefore, we feel it is safe to conclude that the native <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i> has a prominent role in producing the experimental level of irregularity."

Neurons have intrinsic noise, caused by the stochastic nature of ion channels, but the noise is relatively small and most cells fire in an almost deterministic way when the synaptic input is removed. Of course, chaotic firing has been demonstrated in realistic models of neurons (e.g. Canavier, Baxter, Clark and Byrne, J. Neurophysiol 1993, 69:2252-2257), but it is rare for authors to claim that irregularity is caused by chaos. This may be because even a small amount of noise can make the demonstration of chaos ambiguous.</i>"

Adding the Kv1 channels to the model introduces pauses in firing that increase the CV. The model also shows subthreshold oscillations that also act to produce long ISIs, but these are of more variable duration because the oscillation occurs near threshold and is unstable. Every transit through the subthreshold oscillation provides an opportunity for another action potential, and this can produce repeating sequences in firing like those I guess are being detected in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> (although not sure because those sequences were never described). It is important that this phenomenon is independent of the presence of noise. The authors don't say so explicitly, but the model can clearly produce irregular firing via chaotic transitions between pauses, spiking, and unstable periodic orbits. In fact, the noise does not increase the irregularity, but rather decreases the range of parameters at which it is seen, as shown by comparing the extent of the red regions in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and B. That figure also shows that the addition of noisy channels reduces the effect of Kv4 (gt) on CV.</i>"

Our view is that the noise and the nonlinearity are both essential in determining the actual level and characteristics of irregularity. We certainly agree that the noise-free deterministic model actually leads to higher irregularity in some parameter regions of putatively chaotic behaviour. We now state that this behaviour of the fully deterministic model resembles chaos, but that a rigorous demonstration of this by estimating Lyapunov exponents is beyond the scope of this study (Discussion, sixth paragraph). We now highlight, in the Results and Discussion, the fact that this CV(ISI) is unnaturally high (\u22481) and that the addition of the noise reduces it to the experimental value (\u22480.3), while still clearly preserving the existence of the high CV region induced by <i>g<sub>Kt</sub></i>. We conclude in the Discussion that \u201cThus, we believe that the interaction of both elements, the nonlinear deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations and the single-channel dynamical noise, is needed for an adequate description of irregular spiking.\u201d."
