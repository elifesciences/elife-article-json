Molecular gradients provide critical signals to guide growth cones, which are the motile tips of developing axons, to their targets. However, in vitro, growth cones trace highly stochastic trajectories, and exactly how molecular gradients bias their movement is unclear. Here, we introduce a mathematical model based on persistence, bias, and noise to describe this behaviour, constrained directly by measurements of the detailed statistics of growth cone movements in both attractive and repulsive gradients in a microfluidic device. This model provides a mathematical explanation for why average axon turning angles in gradients in vitro saturate very rapidly with time at relatively small values. This work introduces the most accurate predictive model of growth cone trajectories to date, and deepens our understanding of axon guidance events both in vitro and in vivo."

Molecular gradients provide critical signals to guide growth cones, which are the motile tips of developing axons, to their targets. However, in vitro, growth cones trace highly stochastic trajectories, and exactly how molecular gradients bias their movement is unclear. Here, we introduce a mathematical model based on persistence, bias, and noise to describe this behaviour, constrained directly by measurements of the detailed statistics of growth cone movements in both attractive and repulsive gradients in a microfluidic device. This model provides a mathematical explanation for why average axon turning angles in gradients in vitro saturate very rapidly with time at relatively small values. This work introduces the most accurate predictive model of growth cone trajectories to date, and deepens our understanding of axon guidance events both in vitro and in vivo."

Indeed, many neurodevelopmental disorders are likely the result of wiring defects (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yaron and Zheng, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Geschwind and Levitt, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stoeckli, 2012</a>). Axon guidance, where axons grow and navigate to their targets, occurs primarily via the sensing of molecular cues in the environment. A critical mechanism by which such cues act is believed to be concentration gradients, causing axons to be attracted or repelled in particular directions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mortimer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lowery and Van Vactor, 2009</a>).

In vitro assays allow individual influences, such as that from the concentration gradient of a single guidance factor, to be isolated and quantified. A substantial mystery posed by in vitro axonal chemotaxis assays is the relatively weak turning produced, even over long periods of time. The naive prediction that axons would promptly turn until they become fully aligned with the gradient turns out not to be true. In an early study of chemotactic responses of chick sensory neurons to a gradient of nerve growth factor in a diffusion chamber, only 60% of nerve tips were preferentially directed toward the gradient direction after 46\u2009hr of growth (<a href=\"#bib34\">Letourneau, 1978</a>). The growth cone turning assay over 1\u20132\u2009hr produces average turning angles typically ranging from 10\u00a0to\u00a025\u00b0, with high variability (<a href=\"#bib61\">Song et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">H\u00f6pker et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Xiang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ming et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Thompson et al., 2011</a>).

Axons are under mechanical tension from the pull of the growth cone (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bray, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bray, 1979</a>), and this tension stimulates the elongation of the axon by stretching (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bray, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zheng et al., 1991</a>). Traction forces generated in the growth cone arise from the coupling of the continuous retrograde flow of actin to the substrate through adhesion receptors (<a href=\"#bib19\">Franze and Guck, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Betz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Athamneh and Suter, 2015</a>). For reasons which are not clear, axons tend not to bend and follow the highly random movements of their growth cones. Rather, they usually form a straight line between their tip and a location where they are firmly attached to the substrate (i.e. a focal adhesion (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaverina et al., 2002</a>)). We call such locations anchor points; they can be at the soma, at a branch point, or at some other seemingly sporadic location along the axon. Although it is not clear how this tension leads to elongation, the growth cone advances largely in the stretch direction along the axon, resulting in relatively straight paths."

Growth cone movements were first analyzed in detail in (<a href=\"#bib26\">Katz et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Katz, 1985</a>). Subsequently, various phenomenological models have been built that differ as to how they treat stochasticity, and mechanisms for directional preference, namely turning or growth rate modulation. One set attempted to fit the dynamics of growth cone movement to a random walk with drift (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buettner et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Odde and Buettner, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Maskery et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pearson et al., 2011</a>). Li <i>et al</i>. simulated trajectories by assuming the turning angle of the growth cone is in proportion to the angle between the neurite and the resultant filopodial tension (<a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 1995</a>). In (<a href=\"#bib3\">Borisyuk et al., 2008</a>), the axon growth angle depends on the tendency to turn toward the gradient angle and noise. The noise term is small (2\u20135\u00b0), leading to straight paths that resemble axon growth in the tadpole spinal cord. Another set of models has concentrated on how asymmetric receptor binding across the growth cone might be used as the basis of a turning signal (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goodhill et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Xu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mortimer et al., 2010</a>), but without considering the consequence for whole trajectories. A third group of models considers the possibility that the velocity of the growth cone is influenced by an attractive gradient from the target cells, and chemoattractants and chemorepellants released from other growth cones and itself (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hentschel and Ooyen, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Krottje and van Ooyen, 2007</a>). However, none of these models has been closely compared with the details of experimentally measured trajectories in gradients, and parameters such as variability in step sizes, the distribution of instantaneous turning angles, and straightness of real paths, have not been addressed. Thus, the question of whether there is a model that can adequately capture all these characteristics of real trajectories remains open. Without such a model, it is difficult to determine if trajectories observed in vivo are in fact consistent with gradient guidance."

We found experimentally\u00a0that the gradient had no effect on the step sizes; thus, we only model the turning angles. Critically, the model predicts rapid near saturation of average turning angles with time. To test this model quantitatively, we then introduce a new microfluidics assay for studying axonal response to gradients, and using timelapse imaging characterize the behavior of axons over several hours of growth in both attractive and repulsive gradients. We find that our model fits the behavior observed very closely. We then investigate by simulation the effect of increasing the number of anchor points, and find that this increases the average fidelity of turning but at the cost of higher variability. Together, this work both explains why turning response to gradient saturates so rapidly and reveals the quantitative principles that are required to reproduce accurately in vitro axonal trajectories in response to chemotactic gradients. The model identifies straightness as a limiting factor on how much axons can turn and suggests that the frequency of anchor points plays a key role in the axonal turning response to a gradient."

As expected, the pull due to the gradient increased with larger <i>b</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Thus, the persistence term prevented the axon from completely aligning with the gradient. Also apparent is that without noise, the trajectories were all very straight (with straightness index [see 'Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods'] greater than 0.98).

However, the average final turning angle was even less than that of the noiseless case. This is because the noise created more random wandering of the growth cone, further reducing the directional effect of the gradient (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>).

Assuming a normal distribution of turning angles, this means that many of the axons were no longer roughly perpendicular to the gradient, and thus only continued to turn extremely slowly.

Cells were injected into the growing chambers and grown for 2\u2009hr before gradient onset. In the control condition, cells were grown over several hours with 0.3 nM NGF. In the NGF gradient condition, two solutions of concentrations 0 nM and 10 nM NGF were pumped into the growing chamber through the two inlets. Previous work using Scatchard analysis estimated that\u00a0<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> = 0.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 nM (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wehrman et al., 2007</a>) and showed that SCG neuronal outgrowth is severely inhibited at the saturating NGF concentration of 40 nM (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ohta et al., 1990</a>). Given the healthy growth in our assay, it is clear that\u00a0the concentration in the gradient condition was below saturation point. We analyzed trajectories for 300 axons per condition. These were obtained from 23 individual chambers in the control case, 27 chambers in the NGF gradient case, and 24 chambers in the NGF gradient plus KT5720 case. In most experiments, 2 chambers were run in parallel, so the total numbers of experiments in each case were 12, 15, and 13, respectively. For the measurement of turning angles, we selected only axons that started growing between 70\u00b0 and 110\u00b0 relative to the gradient (when present). An asymmetric concentration field of guidance cue across the growth cone leads to turning (<a href=\"#bib61\">Song et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hentschel and Ooyen, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Xiang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ming et al., 2002</a>) and axons growing in this range experienced between 94% (i.e.\u00a0sin\u00a070\u00b0) to 100% (i.e. sin\u00a090\u00b0) of the maximum possible concentration difference across the growth cone. Thus, we expected the impact of the gradient would be strongest on these axons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We tracked the growth cones every 5 min for as long as possible until they collapsed or branched or collided with other cells, axons or the edges of the chamber. The SCG axons were clearly attracted in the NGF gradient (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). When the protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720 was added to the high and low solutions at concentration 70 nM, attraction was converted into repulsion as previously described (<a href=\"#bib61\">Song et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Forbes et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These results confirm that the gradient in the microfluidic assay elicited a guidance response in SCG axons. From the timelapse imaging data, we then selected the subset of axons that did not branch or retract following growth for several hours in the attractive NGF gradient, and measured the turning angles of the population over time. The average turning angle reached the steady state quickly and did not increase significantly with time, matching the prediction of the model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

This implies that often the entire axon segment was pulled sideways across the substrate (as can be seen directly in the movies). Thus, despite the irregular trajectory of the centre of the growth cone, the tension force on the growth cone from the axon was usually pointing directly back to the last anchor point, consistent with the assumptions of the model.

The statistics over 5000 simulated trajectories using these parameters are shown in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>, and some example trajectories are shown in <a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>.

Thus, with realistic step sizes and bearing change noise distributions, the model was able to capture the phenomenon of saturated turning with quantitatively accurate means and variances over time. The distribution of turning angles and step sizes also closely matched the real data (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B,C</a>). The simulated straightness distribution was also very smilar to the real distribution (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.2, <i>t</i>-test) (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12D</a>). The model also captured the distribution of bearing changes, the mean square displacement and the anticorrelation between successive bearing change, which was a consequence of the persistence term straightening the paths (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12D\u2013F</a>). If successive steps were positively correlated, the paths would become more bent over time. This correlation was rapidly lost beyond one time lag because of the large noise."

The model was then able to predict the evolution of the average turning angle over time, the straightness profile and the anticorrelation in bearing changes. Most importantly, it could explain the phenomenon of slow and saturated turning, due to a weak bias term relative to the persistence term. A microscopic factor in each step led to a macroscopic phenomenon of limited, variable turning and straight paths. This often overlooked feature of axon growth turned out to be critical in our model in limiting the overall turning. We also found little difference between the attractive and repulsive case, indicating that attractive and repulsive gradients employed similar mechanisms and could not reduce the variability of axon trajectories."

However, the in vivo environment is much more complex, and axons may establish anchor points with the substrate at multiple positions as they extend. We therefore investigated in the model what effect this would have on turning angles. We assumed that at each timestep, the probability of that point becoming a new anchor point was fixed, while leaving the evolution at each step as before. The average number of anchor points per timestep (i.e. 5\u2009min) is denoted by <i>r</i>. We analyzed two cases: anchoring probabilistically at each time step (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14A\u2013C</a>), and anchoring at regular intervals (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14D\u2013F</a>).

However, it increased the variability in the turning (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14G</a>).

We found that the movement of the growth cone was strongly influenced by the axon\u2019s tendency to maintain a straight trajectory forward, limiting the directional effect of the gradient and preventing the axon from aligning with the gradient even after a long time. Our model predicted that, averaged over a large population of axons, the initial rate of turning drops rapidly over a short period of time (20\u201340 min). The model shows that adding more anchor points can give the growth cone more flexibility and produce larger average turning, but also increases the variability. Thus, we predict that different substrates, producing different densities of anchor points, could result in different trajectories for the same the gradient conditions."

Furthermore, stretch can also regulate the mode of growth. When axons are tightly bound to a sticky substrate, stretching only happens at the tip and axons elongate by tip growth. In contrast, if axons grow relatively unattached to the substrate, they will lengthen by stretching due to the pull of the growth cone (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">O'Toole et al., 2008</a>), which appears to be the case in our experimental condition. The tension along the axon will cause stimulation of growth in the existing direction producing straighter trajectories. The stiffness of axons is also important (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rajagopalan et al., 2010</a>), and stiffer axons will likely have higher persistence due to their more limited ability to bend."

Although anchor points are an abstraction in our model, their biological implementation may be focal adhesions. Only at these points is the axon firmly attached to the substrate. There is\u00a0a number of ways in which anchor points could be investigated experimentally in future work. Axons could be stained for proteins such as integrins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaverina et al., 2002</a>) to test whether their distribution is strongly localized to particular points along the axon. We also predict that applying force orthogonal to the direction of axon growth, for instance by using a pipette to puff liquid at different locations along the axon, would cause a deflection of the axon of a size related to the distance from the nearest anchor point. A similar experiment was performed using a glass needle to tow axons (<a href=\"#bib51\">O'Toole et al., 2008</a>). It was observed that the distal region of the axon was free of the substrate, while the proximal region was firmly attached. In addition, it could be possible to determine the internal stress field of an axon, as has been done for growth cones (<a href=\"#bib2\">Betz et al., 2011</a>): we would expect the stress to in general be different on the two sides of an anchor point. The density of anchor points will depend on the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In our experiments, on laminin, they appeared to be rare. This might be because adhesion points are expensive to produce and the axon can grow faster when it is not attached to the substrate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chang et al., 1998</a>). However, the biological factors governing when new anchor points are generated are unknown."

Substrates with different ECM components differentially promote growth cone motility and point contact formation.

Recent 3D culture models, in which cells are grown with a protein scaffold, can capture some aspects of the tissue environments instead of hard surfaces (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cullen et al., 2007</a>).

The mold with PDMS was degassed in a vacuum chamber for 2\u00a0hr and baked at 80\u00b0C for 2\u00a0hr. The PDMS replica was then peeled from the silicon wafer and cut into individual chambers. Holes were cored in the PDMS chambers using a 0.75 mm corer (Harris Uni-Core). To bond the PDMS chamber to a plastic tissue-culture petri dish, the dish and the chamber were plasma treated at 100W at a pressure of 380 mTorr for 40 s. The plate was then covered with (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (5% APTES in 70% ethanol). The plastic dish was washed thoroughly with water, air dried, and the chamber was pressed onto the dish. To avoid air bubbles forming, the dish was filled with distilled water and degassed in the vacuum chamber for 10 min before use."

After the cells were seeded, the syringes containing the high and low solutions were connected to the chamber using polyethylene tubings. The chamber was moved to an incubated inverted microscope (Zeiss AxioObserver). The syringes were attached to a Harvard PHD pump and the flow rate was set at 10 \u03bcL/hr. After the flow had been started, fluorescent images of the chamber were taken in Zen software. Background intensity outside the chamber was subtracted from the images. The average brightness intensity and variations over time were then calculated across the chamber. A gradient of fluorescence confirmed that the NGF gradient had formed in the growth chamber. To generate a repulsive gradient, KT5720 (Alexis Biochemicals), a specific inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), was added into both the high and low solutions at a concentration of 70 nM."

All axons were tracked manually using customized MATLAB software (The MathWorks) for as long as possible until they branched or retracted. A 5-min time interval was chosen because, for smaller intervals, variability in identifying the centre of the growth cone was larger than the net movement between frames.

There is no evidence that growth cones perform stepwise turning with respect to an anchor point. In the Discussion, the authors describe: \"New anchor points could be established when tension is too high, or when it becomes too energetically expensive to drag the neurite.\" However, I am not aware of published studies that show growth cones physically 'dragging' a neurite (please direct me to such evidence if incorrect). The anchor point idea indeed predicts that the axon between the growth cone and the nearest anchor point should be 'dragged' into the direction where the growth cone moves. Of course, if the anchor point is far away (paper quote: 'the in vitro data we have presented here was well-fitted by assuming the only anchor point is where the axon emerges from the soma'), then a lot of axon would need to be dragged indeed. What would the stiffness of that axon be? The authors acknowledge that the in vivo environment will be more 'complex', but only by assuming there may be more anchor points. Not surprisingly, a closer anchor point allows sharper turns and results in more variability. This simple conclusion is actually one of the major conclusions of the paper."

I am with the authors that a simplification to an elegant in vitro system is a good approach and I would not look for further in vivo relevance, if the in vitro behavior were to fit the model. But if there is an in vivo or in vitro neurite that actually drags an axon between the growth cone and an anchor point, the reader really needs to be shown one. To my knowledge it is more likely that most axons, including in the SCG culture, lay behind the moving growth cone without experiencing any force or tensions required for provide feedback from a hypothetical anchor point. If there is no such feedback, the core of the model cannot be supported."

If such evidence exists for at least some instance, in vivo or in vitro, I can and should be convinced that the model is applicable. This is a true prediction of the core of the anchor point model. In contrast, the measurements provided on the turning speed and the 'saturation' of turning are <i>not</i> true predictions of the model more than they are the basic data the drove the generation of the model in the first place. For example, the authors describe this 'long-standing mystery' many times, use it to justify the model, and then present the data that was used to make the model in the first place as: 'the average turning angle reached the steady state quickly and did not increase significantly with time, matching the prediction of the model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)'. This is a clear case of a model that was made to fit the data. There is no true prediction of the model (one that would not have been possible before running the model) that is tested in the paper. The authors consistently use the wording 'predicted by the model' to describe an outcome of the anchor point model that fits data past or present. Again, I could and should be convinced when, for example, evidence for a real existing anchor point (even just in the SCG culture) were provided, predictions based on tension of the axon, its predicted stickiness to the substrate (as discussed by the authors), etc."

Since our assays did not show poor growth, it suggests that the [NGF] was not saturating.

For example, the authors describe this 'long-standing mystery' many times, use it to justify the model, and then present the data that was used to make the model in the first place as: 'the average turning angle reached the steady state quickly and did not increase significantly with time, matching the prediction of the model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)'. This is a clear case of a model that was made to fit the data. There is no true prediction of the model (one that would not have been possible before running the model) that is tested in the paper.
