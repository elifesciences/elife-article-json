We report that in yeast, such IB formation is a factor-dependent process subjected to age-related decline. A genome-wide, high-content imaging approach, identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ltn1 of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) as a key factor required for IB formation, ubiquitination, and detoxification of model mHtt. The failure of <i>ltn1\u2206</i> cells to manage mHtt was traced to another RQC component, Tae2, and inappropriate control of heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, activity. Moreover, super-resolution microscopy revealed that mHtt toxicity in RQC-deficient cells was accompanied by multiple mHtt aggregates altering actin cytoskeletal structures and retarding endocytosis. The data demonstrates that spatial sequestration of mHtt into IBs is policed by the RQC-Hsf1 regulatory system and that such compartmentalization, rather than ubiquitination, is key to mHtt detoxification."

We report that in yeast, such IB formation is a factor-dependent process subjected to age-related decline. A genome-wide, high-content imaging approach, identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ltn1 of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) as a key factor required for IB formation, ubiquitination, and detoxification of model mHtt. The failure of <i>ltn1\u2206</i> cells to manage mHtt was traced to another RQC component, Tae2, and inappropriate control of heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, activity. Moreover, super-resolution microscopy revealed that mHtt toxicity in RQC-deficient cells was accompanied by multiple mHtt aggregates altering actin cytoskeletal structures and retarding endocytosis. The data demonstrates that spatial sequestration of mHtt into IBs is policed by the RQC-Hsf1 regulatory system and that such compartmentalization, rather than ubiquitination, is key to mHtt detoxification."

The experiments identified several new molecules that are required for mutated Htt to form clumps. Some of these are components of a system called the Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) complex, which monitors newly made proteins and labels abnormal ones for destruction. However, Yang et al.\u2019s findings suggest that the RQC complex regulates the formation of Htt clumps through a different pathway involving a protein called heat shock factor 1. In this case, cells would need to fine-tune heat shock factor 1 activity to make mutant Htt proteins clump together to protect cells from damage."

Mutated and aggregation-prone poly-glutamine-expanded (Poly (Q)) Huntingtins (mHtt) are causing HD by toxic gain-of-functions and, possibly, dominant-negative mechanisms, which are typically manifested in aged individuals (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</a>). While the formation of mHtt inclusion bodies (IBs) correlates with toxicity and disease, such formation might, in effect, be a protective response to limit proteotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arrasate et al., 2004</a>): For example, IB formation predicts improved survival in neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arrasate et al., 2004</a>) and the IB-forming mHtt103QP protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>; exon-1 with 97Q repeats) are not, or only mildly, cytotoxic even when produced at high levels in young yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dehay and Bertolotti, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Duennwald et al., 2006</a>). In contrast, when the innate proline-rich region adjacent the poly (Q) stretch of exon-1 is removed, the protein, mHtt103Q, forms multiple small, highly cytotoxic aggregates/oligomers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Dehay and Bertolotti, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Duennwald et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Meriin et al., 2002</a>). These aggregates are associated with the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib47\">Song et al., 2014</a>) and interfere with the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome-system (UPS) by sequestering the Hsp40 chaperone Sis1 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Park et al., 2013</a>). Chaperones, peptides, and prion-like proteins that either prevent/modify oligomer production (<a href=\"#bib5\">Behrends et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dehay and Bertolotti, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krobitsch and Lindquist, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Muchowski et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gokhale et al., 2005</a>) or convert small aggregates/oligomers into IBs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kayatekin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wolfe et al., 2014</a>) can suppress the toxicity of the proline-less exon-1, suggesting that small aggregates and oligomers are likely culprits in mHtt103Q-derived toxicity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arrasate et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Miller et al., 2011</a>)."

This approach was prompted also by our finding that the ability to form large and single mHtt103QP IBs was lost upon mother cell aging and the mHtt proteins accumulated instead in multiple, three or more smaller aggregates per cell, referred to as Class 3 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>; Class 1 cells contain one aggregate and Class 2 cells contain two aggregates). To identify trans-acting factors required for IB formation in an unbiased genome-wide manner, we used high content microscopy (HCM) and a galactose-regulated version of mHtt103QP, which we introduced into the ordered yeast deletion library (SGA-V2)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib50\">Tong, 2001</a>) of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Upon galactose-induction, mHtt103QP formed aggregates in about 50% of the cells within 180\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>) and 70% of these cells contain one large IB. HCM was used to identify mutants that formed multiple aggregates/oligomers rather than a big IB (Class 3 mutants; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>), which revealed that IB formation requires proteasome/chaperone and ubiquitination functions, Golgi-vesicle trafficking, mRNA transport/metabolism, and cell cycle control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f&amp;g</a>, see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> for a list of confirmed mutants). Among these factors, Ltn1 and Rqc1 are especially interesting as they are both partners of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>) and Ltn1 is the yeast homologue of the E3 RING ubiquitin ligase Listerin of mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>), which reduced activity causes premature neurodegeneration in mice (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chu et al., 2009</a>)."

It\u2019s been reported that the absence of Ltn1, but not Rqc1, results in the failure to tag non-stop protein with ubiquitin (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>). Contrasting such data on non-stop proteins, both Ltn1 and Rqc1-deficieny resulted in a failure of cells to tag also full-length mHtt103QP properly with ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and to form IBs, even though the effect of <i>rqc1\u2206</i> was markedly smaller than <i>ltn1\u2206</i> on IB formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Moreover, both soluble and aggregated mHtt103QP was stable in the absence and presence of Ltn1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and the levels of soluble and aggregated mHtt103QP was somewhat lower in <i>ltn1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2 &amp; 4</a>).

We found that deleting <i>TAE2</i> in <i>ltn1\u2206</i> or <i>rqc1\u2206</i> cells restored IB formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2 &amp; 5</a>) but did not restore ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), demonstrating that ubiquitination is not an absolute requirement for the formation of mHtt103QP IBs. Moreover, overproducing a hyperactive Hsf1 (<i>HSF1-R206S\u00a0</i>[<a href=\"#bib21\">Hou et al., 2013</a>]) alone was sufficient to reduce IB formation, as was reducing Hsf1 activity using the <i>hsf1-848</i>(ts) allele (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). demonstrating that maintaining a proper, intermediate, range of Hsf1 activity is required to efficiently sequester mHtt103QP into IBs. In support of this notion, a deletion in the C-terminal trans-activation domain of Hsf1 resulted in defects in IB formation that could not be further abrogated by an <i>ltn1</i> deletion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>)."

Consistently, a <i>tae2\u2206</i> mutation completely suppressed the toxicity of mHtt103QP in the <i>ltn1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Since the <i>TAE2</i> deletion did not restore mHtt103QP ubiquitination, we conclude that IB formation is more important than ubiquitination for the\u00a0detoxification of mHtt103QP, at least in the yeast model system. Contrasting the <i>LTN1</i> data, the absence of <i>TAE2</i> failed to fully suppress toxicity in <i>rqc1\u2206</i> cells indicating that the roles of Ltn1 and Rqc1 in RQC are overlapping (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>) but not identical. Consistent with small mHtt103QP aggregates/conformers being toxic, both overactive and diminished Hsf1 activity rendered mHtt103QP toxic (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f&amp;g</a>). Since the proline-less, intrinsically noxious, mHtt103Q protein requires the presence of the prion-forming protein Rnq1 to display cytotoxicity in yeast (<a href=\"#bib32\">Meriin et al., 2002</a>), we tested whether the toxicity of mHtt103QP in Ltn1-deficient also required the presence of Rnq1 and found that this was not the case (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>)."

First, using co-staining with the misfolded protein Ubc9<sup>ts</sup>-mCherry, we confirmed that the mHtt103QP proteins of wild type cells were deposited in IBs adjacent to the Ubc9<sup>ts</sup>-associated insoluble-protein-deposit, IPOD (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kaganovich et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Super resolution, three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (SIM) revealed that these mHtt103QP IBs were associated with dense actin cytoskeletal structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Moreover, the actin cytoskeleton appears to harness latent mHtt103QP toxicity as a screen for conditional <i>ts</i> mutations causing synthetic sickness/lethality with mHtt103QP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d&amp;e</a>) revealed that cells carrying <i>ts</i> mutations in genes encoding actin itself (<i>act1</i>), profiling (<i>pfy1</i>) involved in actin polymerization, cofilin (<i>cof1</i>) regulating assembly/disassembly of actin filaments, Arp3 of the actin-nucleation center, Las17, an activator of Arp2/3 and actin assembly factors, and Mss4, a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, were drastically sensitized to mHtt103QP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d&amp;e</a>, also see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> for a list of alleles). The multiple mHtt103QP aggregates formed in <i>ltn1\u2206</i> cells also co-localized with actin cytoskeletal structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), akin to those of the toxic mHtt103Q aggregates reported previously (<a href=\"#bib47\">Song et al., 2014</a>). Actin-mHtt103QP-associated structures were more abundant in Ltn1-deficient cells than in wild type cells whereas the number of aggregate-free forms of actin structures, including actin patches, was reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). Because the actin cytoskeleton is required for proper endocytosis, we tested the effect of mHtt103QP and an <i>ltn1</i> deletion on the rate of endocytic internalization of the dye FM4-64, and found that Htt103QP retarded endocytosis and that such retardation was more pronounced in cells lacking Ltn1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, Ltn1 deficiency did not by itself cause actin cytoskeleton defects or endocytosis retardation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                        "text": "The conserved Listerin (Ltn1) E3 ligase is a key factor involved in targeting protein products derived from defective mRNA or aborted translation for degradation by the 26S proteasome (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>). Upon translation stalling, ribosome recycling factors dissociate 80S ribosome-nascent chain complexes to 60S ribosome-nascent chain-tRNA complexes, which are recognized by Ltn1 and Tae2 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Shao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shao et al., 2013</a>). Both nascent chains and, for example, K12- and R12-arrested polypeptides are substrates for Ltn1-dependent ubiquitin tagging, which signal their destruction by the 26S proteasome (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Preissler et al., 2015</a>). Herein, we report on another pivotal role of Ltn1 in protein quality control \u2013 detoxification of mutant Huntingtin through a Tae2/Hsf1-dependent sequestration of mHtt103QP into actin-associated inclusions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h</a>). As depicted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h</a>, the effect of Ltn1 on mHtt103QP aggregation appears to act through Tae2, which in turn is known to negatively control Hfs1 activity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the presence of Tae2 is known to cause hyperactivation of Hsf1 when <i>LTN1</i> is deleted (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>), which could be enough to inhibit IB formation. On the other hand, mutations reducing Hsf1 activity also inhibited IB formation suggesting that maintaining a proper, intermediate, range of Hsf1 activity is required to efficiently sequester mHtt103QP into IBs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h</a>). In worms, elevated production of small heat shock proteins through Hsf1 activity has been shown to delay the onset of polyglutamine-expansion protein aggregation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hsu, 2003</a>) and reducing <i>hsf-1</i> activity accelerates aging (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hsu, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Morley and Morimoto, 2004</a>). Reciprocally, <i>hsf-1</i> overexpression extends worm lifespan (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hsu, 2003</a>). (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baird et al., 2014</a>). The data presented here, however, demonstrate that both Hsf1 elevation and Hsf1 deficiency in cells expressing the Huntingtin disease protein is detrimental (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h</a>), suggesting, again, that a fine balance of Hsf1 activity has to be maintained to assuage proteotoxicity. This notion might explain why alterations in Hsf1 levels in mammalian cells have been shown to either inhibit mHtt IB formation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fujimoto et al., 2005</a>) or lower the concentration threshold at which HTT forms IB (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bersuker et al., 2013</a>). These results raise the question of whether age-dependent penetrance of HD could be due to a reduced Hsf1 activity in aging tissues or a malignant hyperactivation of Hsf1. The latter scenario could be the result of an age-dependent increase in translational processivity errors, which could titrate the RQC complex eliciting a Tae2-dependent activation of Hsf1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h</a>), possibly through Tae2-directed tagging of incomplete translation products with carboxyl-terminal Ala and Thr extensions.\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib45\">Shen et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "The exact mechanism behind Hsf1-dependent modulation of mHtt IB formation might be complex in that Hsf1 targets other genes than heat shock genes. It has been shown in worms that over-expression of hsf-1, with or without the C-terminal trans-activation domain, elevates the levels of pat-10, a troponin-like protein, that increase actin cytoskeleton integrity leading to lifespan extension and resistance to proteotoxic stress (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baird et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it is possible that Hsf1 may regulate mHtt IB formation/toxicity in the yeast model system through the\u00a0regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics since we found that mHtt103QP is associated with dense actin structures and that genes involved in actin dynamics are required to harness the latent toxicity of mHtt103QP. In addition, our data cannot rule out the possibility that the expression of mHtt in general raises proteostasis stress in the cell leading to Hsf1 activation and that such activation is epistatically affecting the effect of Ltn1-deficieny."

Here, the authors compare two forms of polyQ containing proteins (103Q) that differ by an internal proline region. The toxic form, lacking the P-rich region, forms small aggregates and the less toxic form, containing the P-rich domain forms a single large inclusion body. Asking if the IB formation is an active process, the group has screened for mutants that convert the IB into smaller bodies. The group focuses on Ltn1 and Rqc1 mutations, both of which have been identified for their role in ribosome associated protein quality control. Conversion of the smaller aggregates corresponds with increased toxicity and loss of Tae2, a downstream effector of Ltn1/Rqc1 suppresses both aggregate formation and toxicity."

This effect correlates with toxicity. However, the current manuscript does not differentiate between a direct or indirect role of RQC components in IB formation. RQC deficient cells may have a general proteostasis impairment resulting in failure of the actin cytoskeleton to mediate IB formation. Such proteostasis impairment may not occur (or be less pronounced) in the <i>TAE2</i> deletion strain, consistent with the absence of <i>HSF1</i> activation in that strain (Brandman et al.). The finding that <i>HSF1</i> activation (or suppression) reduces IB formation independently of RQC deficiency could be merely correlative. These aspects should be discussed in more detail. Another important question relates to the interesting possibility that Ltn1 is directly involved in mHtt ubiquitination (also see below)."
