The most frequent mutation (F508del-CFTR) results in altered proteostasis, that is, in the misfolding and intracellular degradation of the protein. The F508del-CFTR proteostasis machinery and its homeostatic regulation are well studied, while the question whether \u2018classical\u2019 signalling pathways and phosphorylation cascades might control proteostasis remains barely explored. Here, we have unravelled signalling cascades acting selectively on the F508del-CFTR folding-trafficking defects by analysing the mechanisms of action of F508del-CFTR proteostasis regulator drugs through an approach based on transcriptional profiling followed by deconvolution of their gene signatures. Targeting multiple components of these signalling pathways resulted in potent and specific correction of F508del-CFTR proteostasis and in synergy with pharmacochaperones. These results provide new insights into the physiology of cellular proteostasis and a rational basis for developing effective pharmacological correctors of the F508del-CFTR defect."

The most frequent mutation (F508del-CFTR) results in altered proteostasis, that is, in the misfolding and intracellular degradation of the protein. The F508del-CFTR proteostasis machinery and its homeostatic regulation are well studied, while the question whether \u2018classical\u2019 signalling pathways and phosphorylation cascades might control proteostasis remains barely explored. Here, we have unravelled signalling cascades acting selectively on the F508del-CFTR folding-trafficking defects by analysing the mechanisms of action of F508del-CFTR proteostasis regulator drugs through an approach based on transcriptional profiling followed by deconvolution of their gene signatures. Targeting multiple components of these signalling pathways resulted in potent and specific correction of F508del-CFTR proteostasis and in synergy with pharmacochaperones. These results provide new insights into the physiology of cellular proteostasis and a rational basis for developing effective pharmacological correctors of the F508del-CFTR defect."

The condition is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a protein called \u201ccystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator\u201d (or CFTR for short). CFTR forms a channel in the membrane of cells in the lungs that help transport salt across the membrane. Mutated versions of the protein are not as efficient at transporting salts, and eventually this damages the lung tissue. As the damage progresses, individuals become very vulnerable to bacterial infections that further damage the lungs and may eventually lead to death."

The inhibitors produced even better results when used in combination with a known CFTR-protecting drug.

Folding occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the sequential action of multiple chaperone complexes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Loo et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Meacham et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rosser et al., 2008</a>) and is followed by export out of the ER and glycosylation in the Golgi before arrival at the plasma membrane (PM), where CFTR undergoes several cycles of endocytosis before degradation in the lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gentzsch et al., 2004</a>). The most frequent mutant, which is present in ~90% of the patients\u00a0with\u00a0CF, misses a phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del-CFTR) and folds in a kinetically and thermodynamically impaired fashion into a conformation that is recognized as defective by the ER quality control (ERQC) system. It is thus retained in the ER and targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome machinery (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jensen et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ward et al., 1995</a>). A small fraction of F508del-CFTR may escape degradation in the ER and reach the PM, where it can function as a channel. This might have therapeutic relevance because patients that express even low levels of functional channel have milder symptoms (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amaral, 2005</a>). However, at the PM, F508del-CFTR is recognized by the peripheral (or PM-associated) quality control (PQC) system and is rapidly degraded in the lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Okiyoneda et al., 2010</a>)."

Notable exceptions are the recent studies on the effects of the unfolded protein response and heat shock response (UPR and HSR, respectively) on the proteostasis of F508del-CFTR. The UPR and HSR operate as <i>homeostatic</i> reactions that tend to redress the imbalances between the load of unfolded proteins and the folding capacity of a cell essentially by enhancing the transcription of the cellular folding machinery. Investigators have therefore sought to induce these reactions by pharmacological means with the aim to rescue the F508del-CFTR folding/transport defect, with partial success (<a href=\"#bib61\">Roth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ryno et al., 2013</a>)."

We and others have previously shown that constitutive trafficking along the secretory pathway is potently controlled by such signalling networks triggered by both extra- and intracellular stimuli (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cancino et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">De Matteis et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Farhan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Giannotta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pulvirenti et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Simpson et al., 2012</a>). This suggests that the machinery of proteostasis viz. protein synthesis, folding, and degradation, is also likely to be controlled by similar signalling systems. Identifying the relevant regulatory components of these systems would not only enhance our understanding of the physiology of proteostasis, but also have significant impact on future therapeutic developments, because components of the signalling cascades, such as membrane receptors and kinases, are generally druggable, and are, in fact, the main targets of most known drugs."

The choice of this strategy over more traditional approaches such as kinome-wide screenings was based on the rationale that since many of the successful drugs target multiple molecular pathways simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lu et al., 2012</a>) and with limited toxicity, elucidating the MOAs of these drugs might lead to uncovering molecular networks that regulate proteostasis in a synergistic and relatively \u2018safe\u2019 manner."

Changes in gene expression are significant components of the MOAs of many drugs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Popescu, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Santagata et al., 2013</a>), and the analysis of transcriptional MOAs is a growing research area (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iorio et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Iskar et al., 2013</a>). However, a major difficulty here is that the available proteostasis regulator drugs include representatives of diverse pharmacological classes such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hutt et al., 2010</a>), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anjos et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carlile et al., 2012</a>), hormone receptor activators (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caohuy et al., 2009</a>), cardiac glycosides (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>), and others. Thus, the effects of the available F508del-CFTR correctors are most probably not mediated by their heterogeneous principal MOA, but by some unknown weak secondary MOAs (\u2018side effects\u2019) that these drugs share. In order to extract the transcriptional changes that are correction-related from those that are due to the (correction-irrelevant) principal MOAs of the corrector drugs we have developed a new approach based on the \u2018fuzzy\u2019 intersection of gene expression profiles. This method, applied to a set of proteostatic correctors will identify genes that are commonly modified by these drugs and should therefore correspond to the correction-related pathways and not to their heterogeneous primary effects. Using this strategy, we harvested a group of few hundred genes that are regulated by most of the proteostatic correctors, and then derived a series of molecular networks from this gene pool through bioinformatic and experimental approaches. Several of these networks are signalling pathways made up of druggable receptors and kinases. Silencing or targeting these pathways with chemical blockers inhibit the degradation in the ER and enhance the transport of F508del-CFTR to the PM. Moreover, the large pool of ER-localised foldable F508del-CFTR that results from the inhibition of ER degradation can be acted upon by pharmacochaperones, to further enhance correction. These findings build on previous screening studies and on the accumulated knowledge of F508del-CFTR proteostasis to start to define the network of signalling pathways that control F508del-CFTR proteostasis, and thereby provide a rational basis for the development of novel, potent and specific proteostasis corrector treatments for CF."

First, we wished to identify sub-groups of correctors, if any, which might have shared correction-relevant MOA. The use of prototype ranked lists (PRLs) for the correctors present in the MANTRA dataset (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iorio et al., 2010</a>) results in the loss of information about fold\u00a0changes in transcript levels and corresponding p-values. Thus, these lists are not suitable for comparisons and cluster analyses made with traditional metrics (such as Correlation or Euclidian distance) and classic partitional or agglomerative/hierarchical clustering methods. However, we attempted to overcome this issue by a state-of-the-art method to 'cluster' the profiles. In the past, in an effort to cluster the drugs present in the connectivity map database (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iorio et al., 2010</a>) based on their transcriptional response similarity, we had designed a novel gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA: [<a href=\"#bib67\">Subramanian et al., 2005</a>]) based metric to obtain similarity scores between ranked lists (see [<a href=\"#bib33\">Iorio et al., 2010</a>] for details). This study resulted in a network that contains clusters of densely interconnected drugs (named drug communities), whose corresponding ranked-lists had high 'similarity' scores. Since this network is basically the output of a state-of-the-art method to cluster the ranked-lists of genes derived from connectivity map, we mined this network in an attempt to cluster the F508del-CFTR corrector drugs. Shown here is the drug similarity network assembled, by iterative affinity propagation clustering. The topology of this network is hierarchical and derived from a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)-derived similarity metric applied to drug-induced transcriptional profiles (see [<a href=\"#bib33\">Iorio et al., 2010</a>] for details). Each node represents a drug. An edge connects two nodes if the corresponding consensual transcriptional responses are significantly similar and its length is inversely proportional to the similarity of the response. The clusters (referred to as drug-communities) correspond to drugs with highly similar transcriptional responses. The F508del-CFTR correctors belonging to this network (from MANTRA dataset) are highlighted together with the identifier of the drug-community they belong to. The nodes (corrector drugs) are color-coded such that drugs belonging to the same community share the same color. The F508del-CFTR correctors do not cluster together, and most of them belong to drug-communities enriched for their primary MOA (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

                                "text": "We then turned to experimental validation of the role of CORE genes in the regulation of F508del-CFTR proteostasis. Experiments were carried out using a characterised biochemical assay (See Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for details) that detects both the amount of core-glycosylated CFTR trapped in the ER (band B with western blotting) and the amount of CFTR fully glycosylated in the Golgi (most of which presumably resides at the PM; band C with western blotting). As a model system, we used non-polarised CFBE41o-cells stably expressing F508del-CFTR (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bebok et al., 2005</a>) (hereafter referred to as CFBE); but many experiments were carried out also in HeLa, BHK and polarized CFBE cells, with results that were in good qualitative agreement with the CFBE data. While this assay is not suitable for large-scale screening, it provides quantitative information on the main proteostasis parameters including CFTR accumulation in the ER, ER-associated CFTR degradation, and transport and processing in the Golgi complex. Moreover, this assay is specific for proteostasis as it separates the effects on the F508del-CFTR protein from the effects on conductance as revealed by faster chloride-permeability assays (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pedemonte et al., 2005</a>). Experimental validation was restricted to a limited set of genes: downregulated CORE genes (to exploit the availability of siRNA-based downregulation and of small-molecule inhibitors) that showed functional coherence, that\u00a0is, were found in protein-protein interaction networks or in enriched GO groups; or were network hubs from Ingenuity analysis, or ubiquitin ligases and signalling molecules. In total, this resulted in a group of 108 genes (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Notably, these genes had no previously reported role in the regulation of F508del-CFTR proteostasis."

As a reference for correction, we used the investigational drug VX-809 (<a href=\"#bib71\">Van Goor et al., 2006</a>), a robust corrector that acts as a pharmacochaperone. VX-809 treatment increased band C levels by four-\u00a0to\u00a0fivefold over control in most experiments. In all, 47 out of the 108 genes tested were found to be active in regulating F508del-CFTR proteostasis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>). Of these, 32 genes (when depleted) enhanced the levels of bands B and C by 1.5-fold to more than 10-fold over controls, while 15 genes decreased bands B and C by 20\u201380% of the control levels. We refer to these as anti-correction and pro-correction genes, respectively. Among these active genes, 30 were CORE genes and 17 were hubs in IPA networks. Notably, the correction that was induced by the\u00a0depletion of many anti-correction genes was greater than that achieved by VX-809 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), or by the corrector drugs originally included in the study (see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This was in particular the case for a group of four poorly characterised ubiquitin ligases (RNF215, UBXO5, ASB8, FBXO7) that were not known to regulate F508del-CFTR proteostasis. RNF215 depletion increased the levels of bands C to over 10-fold the control levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Given these strong effects, RNF215 is a worthy candidate for further studies as a potential ERAD machinery component. Also notably, the depletion of many anti-correction genes not only enhanced the bands B and C but also markedly increased (to different extents) the band C/band B ratio (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that these genes affect the efficiency of export of F508del-CFTR protein from the ER and/or the stability of this protein after export. Given that siRNA treatments often have off-target effects, several controls were performed to ensure the specificity of the observed effects on proteostasis (see Methods section for details). It is also to be noted that the downregulation of anti-correction genes did not change the levels of F508del-CFTR mRNA (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), suggesting that the observed effect is not due to increased F508del-CFTR synthesis, although these data cannot by themselves exclude an effect on translation. Further experiments confirm that the effect of the downregulation of these genes is mostly (if not completely) on F508del-CFTR degradation and folding/export (see below)."

This assay is sensitive and robust enough to detect even small changes in the proteostasis of CFTR. CFTR is resolved by SDS-PAGE into two distinct bands - one at ~140 kDa (band B; core glycosylated protein present in the ER) and another at ~170 kDa (band C; processed by Golgi-localized glycosylation enzymes). In the case of wild type CFTR, the majority of the protein is in the form of band C (not shown) while in the case of mutant F508del-CFTR the major form is band B. Sometimes a lower molecular weight band, termed band A, is also observed that probably corresponds to non-glycosylated CFTR. For the quantitation\u2019s described in this manuscript, bands B and A were considered together as band B. Quantitation of the changes in the levels of bands B and C were carried out as outlined here in this example. CFBE cells were treated with indicated corrector drugs for 48\u00a0hr and were lysed and processed for western blotting as described\u00a0in\u00a0the Materials and methods. Treatment with corrector drugs increases the levels of both band B and band C of F508del-CFTR. Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was used as loading control. To quantitate the levels of bands B and C, the X-ray films obtained were scanned using a flatbed scanner (Hewlett-Packard) at a resolution of 200\u2013600 dpi and exported as 8-bit tiff images. (<b>B</b>) The scanned images were then imported into ImageJ for quantitation. First, the images were converted to grayscale and background of the image was removed using the 'subtract background' function with a rolling ball radius of 50\u2013150 pixels. Next, using the rectangular selection tool, C bands (shown here) or B bands were selected. (<b>C</b>) The gel/blot analysis tool (Analyze&gt;Gels) was then used for quantitation of the selected bands. First the 'select first lane' function was executed followed by the 'plot lane' function. This resulted in a plot as shown here. The area under the curve (as a measure of the density of bands) was then quantitated using the magic wand tool to select the peaks individually and exporting the density into a text file. The quantitated density values are indicated below the plot. We note that the method described here is semi-quantitative; nevertheless, the values obtained adequately describe the biological phenomenon observed. (<b>D</b>) The fold change in band C levels calculated using the measured values of density in (<b>C</b>) is plotted. (<b>E, F</b>) To test whether the semi-quantitative process described here is within the linear range of detection, we resolved indicated quantities of cell lysates prepared from CFBE cells by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting, and the blots were processed as described before. The exposure time of the blots to the X-ray films was varied to get different intensity levels of the bands. Only one exposure of 30 s is shown here (<b>E</b>) for clarity. The intensity of the bands was calculated using ImageJ (see above) and expressed as fold change in band B (<b>E</b>) relative to the minimum value. As can be noted, the amounts of band B quantitated are linear in the range from 10 to 80\u00a0\u03bcg of cell lysate loaded. Similar results were obtained for band C. The linearity was also preserved for exposures that were twice or half of the time shown here. For experiments described in this manuscript the total amount of protein loaded ranged from 25\u00a0to\u00a040\u00a0\u03bcg and exposure time of blots ranged from 30\u00a0to\u00a045 s."

We first analysed the frequency of the active CORE genes among the genes downregulated by the corrector drugs. The CORE genes were ~3-fold enriched in the signatures of correctors compared to those of other ~200 drugs taken at random from the MANTRA database (not shown). We next searched for MANTRA drugs that significantly downregulate the CORE genes (anti-correctors) using GSEA (specifically two-tailed symmetric GSEA as implemented in MANTRA; <a href=\"http://mantra.tigem.it/\">http://mantra.tigem.it/</a>). The top 25 hits included three of the correctors that we had used for the FIT analysis. From the remaining 22, we selected eight drugs (based on availability) for testing in the correction assay. Among these, mitoxantrone was found to potently increase both band C and band B. (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>); in addition, among the top five hits was Vorinostat, an HDAC inhibitor that was shown to act as a corrector (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hutt et al., 2010</a>). Thus, at least 20% (5 out of 22) of the short-listed drugs were correctors, while among a large number (&gt;20) of randomly selected drugs none showed correction activity (not shown). These data suggest that the downregulation of CORE genes is a useful criterion to identify correctors. We then extended our analysis of the top hits by comparing the five active drugs with those that failed to correct and also by examining upregulated genes in their gene expression profiles. The correctors showed a high frequency (two-\u00a0to\u00a0threefold more than non-corrector drugs) of upregulation of the potent pro-corrector genes MKK1, MKK3 and FGFBP1, while the non-corrector drugs upregulated more frequently (two-\u00a0to\u00a0threefold more than corrector drugs) the anti-corrector genes NF-\u03baB2 and MKK7. These results thus suggest that considering also the upregulation of CORE genes will help in further defining the search space for new correctors."

Thus, in order to explore the possible epistatic interactions between the CORE networks/pathways, siRNAs against selected targets were combined and tested on F508del-CFTR rescue. These candidates were chosen for their potential druggability and/or strong effects on correction. Strong synergistic interactions were observed between various combinations of siRNAs against CKII, CAMKK2, MLK3, and NUP50 (a spliceosomal network component) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), thus validating our choice of the approach. As a note of caution here, the efficacy of the combined siRNA treatments was more variable than that observed with single siRNAs. In our experience, this is because siRNAs in combinations are less effective than the individual siRNAs in depleting their target proteins, and a depletion threshold must be reached to achieve synergy. We conclude that, using the FIT technique and a series of bioinformatic and experimental filters, we have identified a set of synergistic molecular networks that show strong control over F508del-CFTR proteostasis."

MLK3 (or MAP3K11) is part of a group of 14 MAP3 kinases that act through cascades of MAP2K and MAPK enzymes. MLK3 can be activated by various PM receptors, including the TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, VEGF, and PDGF receptors, through at least two MAP4Ks (haematopoietic progenitor kinase [HPK]1 and germinal centre kinase [GCK]) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3\u03b2, or via the CDC42/Rac family (summarised in [<a href=\"#bib65\">Schachter et al., 2006</a>]). MLK3 can also be activated by stress, e.g., oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2014</a>) (i.e., it is a Stress Activated Protein Kinase, or SAPK) and it can, in turn, trigger three main kinases: p38 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), depending on cell type and conditions, through the intermediate kinases MKK3/6, MKK4/7 and MKK1/2, respectively (<a href=\"#bib65\">Schachter et al., 2006</a>). MLK3 is also known to be an upstream activator of NF-kB (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hehner et al., 2000</a>).

Among the components upstream of MLK3, we found TGF receptors, CDC42, Rac2, and HPK1 to be active in correction (i.e. their depletion induced correction) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Within the cascade downstream of MLK3, MKK7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and further downstream, JNK2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) were active components (JNK2 is highly expressed in bronchial epithelial cells [<a href=\"http://biogps.org\">http://biogps.org</a>]). The p38 MAPK, also downstream of MLK3 (through MAP2K3 and MAP2K6) was inactive in CFBE but moderately active in HeLa cells, indicating some cell\u00a0type-dependent specificity in the effects of these kinases (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, altogether, suppression of the MKK7-JNK2 branch of the MLK3 pathway induced F508del-CFTR correction.

CFBE cells treated with MLK3 or JNK2 siRNA for 72\u00a0hr were transfected with Proteasome ZsProsensor-1 for the final 24 hr, and the levels Proteasome ZsProsensor-1 monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Treatment with MG132 (20 \u03bcg/ml for 3\u00a0hr), a proteasomal inhibitor, was used as a positive control. While treatment with MG132 increases the fluorescence levels of ZsProsensor-1 compared to untreated cells indicating a reduced proteasome activity, downregulation of MLK3 or JNK2 did not change the levels of fluorescence, suggesting that proteasome activity is not changed under these conditions. (<b>D</b>) CFBE cells were treated with MLK3 or JNK2 siRNA and processed for western blotting to monitor the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins. There was no change in the levels of poly ubiquitinated proteins suggesting that these treatments do not affect proteasome activity. (<b>E</b>) Downregulation of MLK3 does not affect the folding of F508del-CFTR. CFBE cells expressing wild type CFTR or F508del-CFTR were treated with MLK3 siRNA as indicated. Untreated CFBE cells incubated at 26\u00b0C for 24\u00a0hr were used as a positive control for the promotion of folding. Membrane fractions from the cells were isolated and subjected to trypsin digestion for 10 min on ice, followed by western blotting with M3A7 antibody that recognizes the NBD2 domain of F508del-CFTR, or with 3G11 antibody that recognizes NBD1. The wild-type CFTR and its NBD domains show more resistance to trypsin digestion compared to F508del-CFTR. There was no change in the stability of F508del-CFTR or its NBD domains upon downregulation of MLK3, while the low temperature treatment enhanced the stability of F508del-CFTR and its NBD1 domain. The western blots are representative of at least three different experiments. (<b>F</b>) Downregulation of MLK3 does not affect the exit of cargo from the ER. CFBE cells were treated with MLK3 siRNA for 72 hr, and during the final 16 hr they were transfected with VSVG-GFP and incubated at 40\u00b0C. The cells were then shifted to 32\u00b0C to allow the exit of cargoes from the ER. The cells were fixed at the indicated times after shift to 32\u00b0C and labeled for GM130 (red) to mark the Golgi apparatus and DAPI (blue) to stain the nucleus. The rate of transport of VSVG-GFP (green) either from ER to Golgi or from Golgi to the PM was not significantly affected by the downregulation of MLK3. Bar = 20 \u03bcm. G. HeLa cells were treated with JNKi II (2.5\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0hr and F508del-CFTR was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitate was subjected to western blotting to reveal the amount of associated HOP. The blots (like in the insert) were quantitated and normalized to the levels of F508del-CFTR (not shown). The values are presented as mean \u00b1 SD (n&gt;3)."

This is not explained by reduced ERAD alone and suggested that the MLK3 pathway might have additional effects on the folding/ export of F508del-CFTR, or on the stability of band C at the PM (or both). The trypsin susceptibility assay to assess the folding status of F508del-CFTR and an assay for protein transport out of the ER using vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG), a classical probe to study secretory trafficking, ruled out large effects of the MLK3 pathway on F508del-CFTR folding or on the general ER-export machinery (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). Nevertheless, we note that these assays (trypsin susceptibility or VSVG export) are limited in their scope and do not capture the wide spectrum of subtle regulations that can influence the outcome of proteostasis (see below for a discussion of the effect of the MLK3 pathway on folding/export). We next tested the effect of MLK3 on the stability of F508del-CFTR at the PM. We depleted MLK3 and exposed the cells to low temperature (26\u00b0C), to accumulate F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, and then shifted the cells back to 37\u00b0C, a temperature at which the F508del-CFTR at the PM is subjected to accelerated ubiquitination and degradation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Okiyoneda et al., 2010</a>). Under these conditions, the depletion of MLK3 slowed the degradation rate of band C, increasing the t<sub>1/2</sub> from ~2 to ~4\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>), whereas overexpression of CDC42 to activate MLK3 enhanced the band C degradation rate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). These data suggest that also the peripheral QC of F508del-CFTR is regulated by MLK3. In contrast, the knockdown of JNK2 (or its overexpression) did not change the degradation kinetics of band C, although it increased the band C/band B ratio (not shown), suggesting that JNK2 may have additional effects, for instance on the folding and/or export of F508del-CFTR (see above and Discussion). Similar effects on F508del-CFTR folding seem likely to be induced also by many of the CORE genes whose depletion greatly increases the band C/band B ratio, in some cases up to 4-fold over control levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

                                "text": "We next tested the effect of selected kinase inhibitors on F508del-CFTR proteostasis in CFBE cells. A well-known characteristic of the kinase inhibitors is their promiscuity. In our experience, inhibitors that nominally target the same kinase can cause divergent effects on correction (see below), most likely because they target other kinases with different or competing effects. We sought to overcome this difficulty by selecting kinase inhibitors with different structures and modes of action, and by using information from the KINOMEscan library (<a href=\"http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/data/kinomescan/\">http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/data/kinomescan/</a>). For JNK, we tested a set of 10 reported JNK inhibitors (JNKi), three of which led to robust increases in the levels of band B and band C (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>; JNKi II, JNKi IX, JNKi XI) at concentrations that were required for JNK inhibition in CFBE cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These JNK inhibitors have different chemical structures; moreover, while JNKi II and JNKi IX are ATP-competitive inhibitors of JNK, JNKi XI is an inhibitor of substrate/scaffold binding to JNK. Therefore,\u00a0they appear to be reliable tools to correct F508del-CFTR by targeting JNK. A previously proposed MLK3 inhibitor (K252a) had no clear effects on correction, perhaps because it inhibits MLK3 weakly and has diverging effects on other kinases (see <a href=\"http://www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/screening-compounds/345892\">http://www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/screening-compounds/345892</a>). We thus searched the KINOMEscan library for a molecule that had a suitable inhibitory pattern on the MLK3 pathway. (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol (hereafter referred to as oxozeaenol) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ninomiya-Tsuji et al., 2003</a>) potently inhibits the MLK3 pathway members VEGF and PDGF receptor kinases and (less potently) MLK3 itself and MKK7, as well as, more weakly, a few kinases with antagonistic effects on correction (<a href=\"http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/db/datasets/20211/\">http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/db/datasets/20211/</a>). Oxozeaenol markedly increased the bands B and C of F508del-CFTR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). This drug had been identified as a corrector in an earlier screening study, and proposed to have F508del-CFTR corrector properties as an inhibitor of TAK1 (MAP3K7) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Trzcinska-Daneluti et al., 2012</a>). However, the downregulation of TAK1 itself had no effect on correction (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Although the pharmacological inhibition and the siRNA knockdown of kinases can sometimes have distinct consequences, these data suggest that oxozeaenol likely acts through MLK3 pathway kinases to affect proteostasis rather that through TAK1. In line with this notion, the corrective effects of oxozeaenol were not additive with MLK3 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and were accompanied by a reduction in phospho c-jun levels (c-jun phosphorylation is diagnostic of JNK activity) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

Indeed, when we added both MLK3 pathway inhibitors and VX-809, there was potent synergy between them (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>) with increases in levels of band C that were over 20-fold the basal band C level and fourfold over those obtained with VX-809 alone.

The effects on their proteostasis was monitored by assessing changes in their glycosylation patterns (NCC, P-gp, hERG mutants) or in their intracellular movement from the ER to the Golgi complex (ATP7B mutants). JNKi II rescued some of these mutants (P-gp DY490 and ATP7B mutants), while it had no effects or had \u2018negative\u2019 effects, on others (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). The effects on ATP7B were large and led to almost complete correction, as we report elsewhere (Chesi et al., submitted). We also tested the effect of JNKi II on other endogenous non-mutant proteins (apart from Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase that was a reference in many of our treatments) including, E-cadherin, IGF1R-\u03b2 and EGFR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>) and found no effect on their proteostasis. Both P-glycoprotein and ATP7B, like CFTR, have two groups of transmembrane domains with an interconnecting nucleotide-binding domain. Moreover, the mutations tested (DY490 and H1069Q) are located in the nucleotide-binding domains of these proteins, and result from either a loss or substitution of aromatic amino acids, as for F508del-CFTR. These similarities suggest that a common proteostatic machinery might be involved in the processing of these mutants and can be targeted by the MLK3 pathway in a selective fashion."

Most of the CORE pathways enhance the efficiency of QC and degradation. This is the case of the MLK3 pathway, which can be activated by selected cytokines and by cellular stresses. The ERBB4 pathway, in contrast, is activated under growth conditions, and appears to have the effect of suppressing the QC and degradation processes. It may be speculated that cells under stress need to reduce the toxic burden of certain classes of unfolded proteins to survive, while growing cells might need to \u2018tolerate\u2019 higher levels of folding/unfolded proteins to proliferate, and that the CORE pathways regulate the proteostasis machinery according to needs. A further possibility is that at least part of the CORE pathways might function as part of an internal control system (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cancino et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Luini et al., 2014</a>) that is activated by the presence of unfolded/misfolded proteins. Interestingly in this regard, MLK3 interacts directly with (and might be activated by) HSP90 (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zhang et al., 2004</a>), a component of the F508del-CFTR folding and QC machinery."

Also importantly, they can be hyperactivated under pathological conditions, leading to vicious circles. For example, large amounts of ROS are produced by neutrophils in the inflamed lungs of CF patients (<a href=\"#bib75\">Witko-Sarsat et al., 1995</a>), and elevated serum VEGF are detected in some CF patients (<a href=\"#bib46\">McColley et al., 2000</a>). Both of these molecules act via the MLK3 pathway to enhance the degradation of F508del-CFTR, and in particular the ROS do so with striking efficacy and speed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). These effects most probably result in lowering F508del-CFTR to levels below those that would be determined by the primary folding defect, which might be harmful because even low residual levels of F508del-CFTR may help to improve the CF phenotype in the long term (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amaral, 2005</a>). Blocking the MLK3 pathway is thus probably important to stop maladaptive processes that can adversely affect therapeutic efforts. Similar considerations apply to the CAMKK2 and other CORE-derived pathways."

The simplest interpretation of the data is therefore that inhibition of the MLK3 pathway regulates this folding/degradation switch by impairing the entry of F508del-CFTR into the degradation pathway and giving the mutant more time to fold and exit the ER. Although MLK3 does not measurably affect the folding of F508del-CFTR as measured by the trypsin susceptibility assay, it cannot be excluded, however, that MLK3 (and other CORE genes) might exert subtle direct actions on the folding and/or ER export mechanisms. This is supported by the strong effects of some of the CORE pathways on the band C/band B ratio, and also by the observation that the inhibition of MLK3 markedly stimulates the efficiency of export of a mutant of ATP7B (similar in structure to CFTR) from the ER (Chesi et al., submitted)."

HOP serves as a link between HSC70 and HSP90 in the F508del-CFTR folding process, and its depletion induces rescue of F508del-CFTR (<a href=\"#bib45\">Marozkina et al., 2010</a>), possibly by acting on the folding/ERQC switch discussed above. Thus, a reduced interaction of HOP with F508del-CFTR\u2013associated QC/folding complex might be one of the possible modes of action of MLK3 on F508del-CFTR rescue. This might be an example of how corrector drugs may act by modulating the \u2018activity\u2019, rather than the levels, of relevant machinery proteins. A complete analysis of the effects of the MLK3 pathway on the interactions and posttranslational modifications of the ERQC/ERAD machinery components remains a task for future work."

For instance, over 120 inhibitors against the correction-related kinases identified in this study (not shown) are currently in clinical trial. Moreover, as shown for the case of oxozeaenol (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>), suitable kinase inhibitors can be selected in a rational fashion by matching the list of CORE kinases with the kinase inhibitory patterns of the many available drugs of this class, according to polypharmacology principles (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aggarwal et al., 2007</a>).

These observations, together with the fact that the CF genetic modifiers TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 potently affect F508del-CFTR proteostasis, support the notion that a regulatory network similar to that uncovered in CFBE cells operates on the proteostasis machinery in bronchial epithelial cells in CF patients."

To this end, we first analysed the kinetics of action of the corrector drugs in modulating F508del-CFTR proteostasis. HeLa cells stably expressing HA-tagged F508del-CFTR (<a href=\"#bib51\">Okiyoneda et al., 2010</a>) were treated with selected corrector drugs (from MANTRA dataset) that resulted in a detectable increase in the intensity of band B already after 3\u00a0hr, while the effects on band C levels were detectable only after 12\u201324\u00a0hr of drug treatment (not shown). In order to minimize the toxic effects of actinomycin D on cell physiology and since the increase in band C was always preceded by an increase in band B, we decided to monitor the actinomycin D sensitivity of the corrector drugs towards the regulation of F508del-CFTR proteostasis by monitoring the early changes in band B levels. To this end, HeLa cells stably expressing HA-tagged F508del-CFTR were treated either with corrector drugs alone ([Chlorzoxazone [50 \u00b5M], Glafenine [50 \u00b5M], Trichostatin-A [500 nM], Dexamethasone [500 nM], Doxorubicin [500 nM]) or along with 10 ug/ml actinomycin-D for 3\u2009hr and the\u00a0levels of band B were determined by western blotting. While actinomycin D treatment did not have any effect on the increase in band B levels resulting from treatment with VX-325 or Corr-4a, it significantly reduced band B levels in other cases (not shown). This suggests that the corrector drugs (except VX-325 and Corr-4a) are proteostatic regulators that act by inducing transcriptional changes in the cell."

In these PRLs, cell line-specific responses are diluted, thus summarising consensual transcriptional responses to drug treatment. In each PRL, microarray probe-sets are ordered from the most upregulated to most downregulated one. We downloaded PRLs for the whole panel of small molecules in the connectivity map (<a href=\"www.connectivitymap.org\">www.connectivitymap.org</a>) from which the MANTRA database is derived (<a href=\"http://mantra.tigem.it/\">http://mantra.tigem.it/</a>). We used these in conjunction with ranked lists of probe sets based on fold\u00a0changes (and assembled following the guidelines provided in [<a href=\"#bib33\">Iorio et al., 2010</a>]) from microarray profiles that we generated in house (CFBE dataset)."

The top and bottom 20% of the probe-sets (corresponding to the up- and downregulated probe-sets, respectively) were used for the analysis. The 20% cut-off was used since the merging of individual gene expression profiles into PRLs precludes the application of other thresholds based on fold\u00a0change (or p-value) to identify significantly differentially expressed genes. To build a null model against which the significance of the final genes sets can be tested (as detailed below), a fixed number of PRLs (N) from the MANTRA dataset were randomly selected and the upregulated or downregulated probe-sets from this selection were intersected by varying the fuzzy cut-off threshold (i.e. the ratio of drugs that a given probe-set should transcriptionally respond to, in order to be considered \u2018consistently\u2019 regulated, hence to be included in the fuzzy intersection). After 1000 of these iterations, we derived an empirical null distribution of the number of probes included in the resulting fuzzy intersections and used it for p-value assignments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). For the CFBE dataset (generated on an Agilent platform, which is different from that used for the connectivity map and MANTRA database), we derived this null distribution by randomly permuting all the individual probes. Finally, we determined the optimal fuzzy cut-off values for the transcriptional profiles elicited by the corrector drugs (11 contained in MANTRA and 13 in the CFBE dataset). Briefly, we selected the value such that the number of probes present in the final fuzzy intersection was at least threefold higher than that expected by random chance and its p-value &lt; 0.05 (according to the computed null models). By using this method, no significantly upregulated probes from the MANTRA dataset were identified across all of the range of tested fuzzy cut-offs. For the downregulated probe-sets a fuzzy cut-off of 8 (out of 11 corrector drugs) or above produced significant fuzzy intersection of probe-sets. For the CFBE dataset, a significant cut-off of 6 drugs (out of 13) and above was identified. To optimise the selection of these cut-offs\u00a0further, we chose the maximal cut-off yielding a fuzzy intersection of probe-sets enriched in one or more Gene Ontology terms. With this criterion, we obtained a final cut-off value of 8 for the MANTRA downregulated probe set and cut-off of 9 for the CFBE dataset. Intersecting the corrector-induced gene expression profiles using this optimal fuzzy cut-off resulted in 541 upregulated probe-sets (mapping 402 unique genes) and 191 downregulated probe-sets (mapping to 117 unique genes) for the CFBE dataset, and 108 downregulated probe-sets (mapping 102 genes) for the MANTRA dataset. Note that most of the CORE genes (519 out of the 621 CORE genes) are derived from the CFBE dataset. This, we suppose, is due to the use of PRLs in the case of cMAP dataset and use of data derived from a single cell line in the case of CFBE dataset. The use of single cell line-derived data can potentially lead to high number of false positives since perturbation-independent response of cell lines to treatments is usually stronger than the perturbation-dependent response (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iorio et al., 2010</a>)."

This was performed by a permutation test where, in a series of iterations, the fuzzy cut-off is kept constant and the number of randomly selected drugs varied within a given range (specifically from 1 to 20). At each of these iterations, we computed the cardinality of the resulting fuzzy intersections, observing that this value reached a plateau at 10 drugs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), which suggests that the number of drugs that was used in the analysis (i.e. 11 drugs in the cMAP dataset) was fairly close to the optimal level."

(4) Overexpression of identified hits show an opposite effect on proteostasis to that of the siRNAs (see below <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).\u00a0(5) Finally, there was a positive correlation between the concentration of siRNAs used and the effect on proteostasis (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). All these evidence together confirm the specificity of the observed effect of the siRNAs on proteostasis."

CFBE41o<sup>-</sup> cells (1x10<sup>6</sup>) were seededonto 12-mm fibronectin-coated Snapwell inserts (Corning) and the apical medium was removed after 24\u00a0hr to establish an air-liquid interface. Transepithelial\u00a0resistance was monitored using an EVOM epithelial\u00a0volt-ohm\u00a0meter and cells were used\u00a0when the transepithelial resistance was 300\u2013400 \u03a9.cm<sup>2</sup>. CFBE41o<sup>-</sup> monolayers were treated on both sides with optiMEM medium containing 2% (v/v) FBS and one of the following compounds: 0.1% DMSO (negative control), or compounds at the stated dosage for 48\u00a0hr before being mounted\u00a0in EasyMount chambers and voltage-clamped using a VCCMC6 multichannel current-voltage clamp (Physiologic Instruments). The apical membrane conductance was functionally isolated by permeabilising the basolateral membrane with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/ml nystatin and imposing an apical-to-basolateral Cl<sup>-</sup> gradient. The basolateral bathing solution contained 1.2 mM NaCl, 115 mM Na-gluconate, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.24 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and 10 mM glucose (pH 7.4). The CaCl<sub>2</sub>concentration was increased to 4mM to compensate for the chelation of calcium by gluconate. The apical bathing solution contained 115 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.24 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and 10 mM mannitol (pH 7.4). The apical solution contained mannitol instead of glucose to eliminate currents mediated by Na-glucose co-transport. Successful\u00a0permeabilization of the basolateral membrane was obvious from the reversal of <i>I<sub>sc</sub></i> under these conditions. Solutions were continuously gassed and stirred with 95% O<sub>2</sub>-5% CO<sub>2</sub> and maintained at 37\u00b0C. Ag/AgCl reference electrodes were used to measure transepithelial\u00a0voltage and pass current. Pulses (1\u00a0mV amplitude, 1\u00a0s duration) were delivered every 90\u00a0s to monitor resistance. The voltage clamps were connectedto a PowerLab/8SP interface for data collection. CFTR was activated by adding 10 \u00b5M\u00a0forskolin to the apical bathing solution."

So we have not applied a traditional hierarchical cluster analysis (or GENE-E as mentioned by the reviewer). However, we attempted to overcome this issue by an alternative way to \u201ccluster\u201d the profiles. In the past, in an effort to cluster the cMap drugs based on their transcriptional response similarity, we had designed a novel Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based metric to obtain similarity scores between ranked lists (see Iorio et al., PNAS 2010 for details). This study resulted in a network that contains clusters of densely interconnected drugs (named drug communities), whose corresponding ranked-lists had high \u201csimilarity\u201d scores. Since this network is basically the output of a state-of-the-art method to cluster the ranked-lists of genes derived from cMap, we have mined this network in an attempt to cluster the F508del-CFTR corrector drugs.

Moreover, for selected genes (MLK3, CAMKK2, RNF215, NUP50 and CD2BP2) the findings from the screening studies were reinforced using additional siRNAs (for instance, 5 additional siRNAs for MLK3; see <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 6</a> for details of the siRNAs used) that showed similar effects on proteostasis of F508del-CFTR (not shown). 3) The coherent effects of the known signaling pathway components on proteostasis that suggests that the observed effects of kinase inhibition are not due to off-target effects. 4) The results presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> where the overexpression of the MLK3 pathway proteins show an opposite effect on proteostasis to that of the siRNAs further confirms the specificity of the effect of the siRNAs used. 5) The control suggested by the reviewers where we have done a dose-dependency of the effect of a set of siRNAs (targeting RNF215, CD2BP2, MLK3 or JNK2) and found a positive correlation between the concentration of siRNAs used and the effect on proteostasis (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

This is supported by the strong effects of some of the CORE pathways on the band C/band B ratio, and also by the observation that the inhibition of MLK3 markedly stimulates the efficiency of export of a mutant of ATP7B (similar in structure to CFTR) from the ER (Chesi et al., submitted).\u201d"

However, these assays also revealed a quantitative discrepancy between the effect on proteostasis and the effect on chloride channel activity, i.e. a 20-fold increase in Band C levels corresponds only to 4-5 fold increase in chloride channel activity at the PM, even with the use of the potentiator VX-770. Regulation of the chloride channel activity is a complex phenomenon and is determined by several factors including proteostasis pathways, signaling pathways (for e.g. PKA pathway) and the presence (or absence) of regulators such as NHERF and cytoskeletal components. The apparent discrepancy between the effect on proteostasis and the effect on chloride channel activity [which has been observed before (see Hutt et al. 2010) suggests that restoration of proteostasis alone may not be enough to functionally restore chloride channel activity at the PM. Further studies that reveal the regulatory network controlling the activity of the channel at the PM will complement our study on proteostasis and will help in the rational design of pharmaceutical approaches. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now discussed this issue in the Discussion, as stated before."
