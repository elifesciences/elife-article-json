High-ranked individuals are represented in higher positions than low-ranked individuals. We show that conceptual metaphorical mapping between social rank and the representational domain exists in our closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees. Chimpanzee participants were requested to discriminate face identities in a vertical arrangement. We found a modulation of response latencies by the rank of the presented individual and the position on the display: a high-ranked individual presented in the higher and a low-ranked individual in the lower position led to quicker identity discrimination than a high-ranked individual in the lower and a low-ranked individual in the higher position. Such a spatial representation of dominance hierarchy in chimpanzees suggests that a natural tendency to systematically map an abstract dimension exists in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees."

High-ranked individuals are represented in higher positions than low-ranked individuals. We show that conceptual metaphorical mapping between social rank and the representational domain exists in our closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees. Chimpanzee participants were requested to discriminate face identities in a vertical arrangement. We found a modulation of response latencies by the rank of the presented individual and the position on the display: a high-ranked individual presented in the higher and a low-ranked individual in the lower position led to quicker identity discrimination than a high-ranked individual in the lower and a low-ranked individual in the higher position. Such a spatial representation of dominance hierarchy in chimpanzees suggests that a natural tendency to systematically map an abstract dimension exists in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees."

For example, a photograph of a high-ranked, dominant chimpanzee could be shown above a photograph of a lower-ranked chimpanzee (a coherent stimulus) or below a photograph of a lower-ranked chimpanzee (an incoherent stimulus). The chimpanzees doing the tests had to identify which of the photographs they had been shown earlier by touching the correct photograph on a screen."

This suggests that the neural representations of social status and physical position might be linked in chimpanzees. If the social status and the physical position of the photograph match, the chimpanzee doing the test can quickly identify the photograph that it has been shown earlier. However, if they do not match, the conflict between the neural representations of social status and physical position slows down the response. These findings suggest that conceptual metaphors are not uniquely human and, moreover, that they could have emerged before the development of language."

The cross-modal correspondence between the visuospatial domain (high or low) and an abstract domain (rank) has been described as a conceptual metaphor (<a href=\"#bib11\">Lakoff and Johnson, 1980a</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">b</a>) and thought to be uniquely human (<a href=\"#bib6\">Feldman and Narayanan, 2004</a>). A conceptual metaphor takes one concept and connects that to another concept in order to better understand that concept. The way we think and act is largely influenced by conceptual metaphors, even without being fully aware of them (<a href=\"#bib11\">Lakoff and Johnson, 1980a</a>). The question remains if conceptual metaphorical mapping is indeed uniquely human or if it appears in other primates and thus describes a conceptual metaphorical mapping that predates language.

The abilities of object representation and recognition further apply to social domains such as recognition of faces (<a href=\"#bib3\">Dahl et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Dahl et al., 2013</a>), conspecifics (<a href=\"#bib3\">Dahl et al., 2007</a>), and ingroup-outgroup members (<a href=\"#bib22\">Pokorny and de Waal, 2009</a>). To avoid or reduce costly social conflicts among individuals, a crucial skill for living in social groups is to express one\u2019s status and to recognize the status of the others via visual or vocal cues (<a href=\"#bib20\">Paxton et al., 2010</a>). Recognition of status or rank allows inferences about expected roles of oneself and of others during group situations (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ridgeway and Diekema, 1989</a>). Access to food resources, information and social respect are facilitated with high rank in the hierarchy, while some degree of protection and care are granted to lower-ranked individuals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fiske, 1992</a>). In many non-human species, spatial information, such as perceived physical body size, and facial and body postures, serve as an indicator of social status (<a href=\"#bib14\">Maestripieri, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Tiedens and Fragale, 2003</a>). Besides these non-verbal cues, we humans developed a conceptual metaphor, which connects social rank to the spatial domain (e.g., \u201chigh\u201d vs \u201clow status\u201d [<a href=\"#bib21\">Pinker, 1997</a>]). Accordingly, humans represent social status in a pyramidal-like structure (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bosserman, 1983</a>): high-ranked individuals are represented in spatially higher positions than low-ranked individuals in diverse contexts, for example, stratification (<a href=\"#bib25\">Saunders, 1989</a>), organizations (<a href=\"#bib28\">Weber, 1991</a>), religion, family, human needs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Maslow, 1943</a>), and others. In this study, we examined if such conceptual metaphorical mapping between social dominance and the spatial domain is uniquely human or if it appears in our evolutionary closest relative, the chimpanzees. We addressed this question by comparing response latencies on discriminating photographs of familiar chimpanzee faces of high- and low-ranked individuals in a vertically aligned delayed matching-to-sample task. We hypothesize that <i>coherent</i> arrangements, such as a high-ranked individual presented in the higher and a low-ranked individual presented in the lower position, lead to quicker identity discrimination than <i>incoherent</i> arrangements, such as a high-ranked individual in the lower and a low-ranked individual in the higher position."

The chimpanzees were required to indicate which of the two simultaneously presented faces (match, distractor) corresponds to the initially presented face (cue) in identity by touching one of the faces. Note that the participants did <i>not</i> classify the stimuli based on social rank. In addition to <i>coherent</i> and <i>incoherent</i> combinations of <i>stimulus</i> and <i>position</i>, we included a neutral condition combining two pictures of closely ranked individuals in a trial (<i>close</i> condition). In the first step of analyses, we pooled response latencies for <i>coherence</i> (<i>coherent</i> vs <i>incoherent</i> vs <i>close</i>) and <i>position</i> (<i>high</i> vs <i>low</i>). Using a mixed model ANOVA with <i>coherence</i> and <i>position</i> as fixed factors, we found a main effect for <i>coherence</i> (<i>F</i>(2, 30) = 5, m.s.e. = 1.10e+004, p&lt;0.001), but not for <i>position</i> (p&gt;0.34) or the interaction between the two factors (p&gt;0.83) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

High-ranked participants showed the same response patterns as low-ranked participants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Due to the low sample size, we were unable to run statistical tests across participants; however, we collapsed all data samples of high-ranked participants for <i>coherent</i>, <i>incoherent</i> and <i>close</i> conditions and compared them to the corresponding conditions in low-ranked participants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests revealed that none of the frequency distributions of response latencies were statistically different across the two participant groups (all p&gt;0.54). In addition, we calculated a sensitivity index reflecting the amount to which two sample distributions are separable from each other (also referred to as d-prime). We again split the data according to the rank of the individuals (high- vs low-ranked) (equivalent to splitting according to the stimulus sets). We further binned data samples (response latencies) across participants for <i>coherent</i> and <i>incoherent</i> trials.

Importantly, the participants were not trained on discriminating the ranks of the presented individuals. Instead, they were substantially affected by the rank while discriminating the identity of those individuals.

We accounted for potential confounding perceptual cues, such as physical height, gestures and postures (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ridgeway and Diekema, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Paxton et al., 2010</a>). However, teasing apart perceptual and conceptual determinants entirely is almost impossible. There might be a co-dependence of the two domains, with the conceptual domain having been established on the basis of the perceptual domain. We applied the following control for a perceptual confound: If perceptual cues cause the effect, for example high-ranked individuals would naturally appear in higher positions than low-ranked individuals, the response characteristics of high-ranked and low-ranked participants would be different due to the rank difference between participant and the presented individuals: A high-ranked participant is more likely to show response facilitation for low-ranked individuals, while a low-ranked participant is more likely to show response facilitation for high-ranked individuals. This, however, is not the case. Response characteristics are similar in high-ranked and low-ranked participants. Thus, even though perceptual determinants cannot be fully excluded with this control, it is still suggestive that the effect is not merely based on perceptual cues but on, to some extent, conceptual components."

Moreover, merely looking at number causes a shift of attention to the left or the right side (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fischer et al, 2003</a>). In other words, the mental number line reflects a cross-modal mapping of visual cues (numbers) and cognitive labels (values). Interestingly, social status and number comparisons recruit to some extent overlapping neural substrates in the intraparietal sulci of the human brain (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chiao et al., 2009</a>). There is evidence for a non-verbal, supramodal neural representation of numerosity in the macaque ventral intraparietal sulcus and lateral prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Nieder, 2012</a>); however, neural evidence for cross-modal correspondences is missing. Rare evidence for non-human cross-modal correspondences comes from visuo-auditory mappings between high luminance and high pitch in chimpanzees (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ludwig et al., 2011</a>). This relationship between luminance and pitch illustrates a form of sound-symbolism, which refers to the concept that in human language words and referents are not arbitrary (<a href=\"#bib19\">Nuckolls, 1999</a>). Hence, while the existence of such a systematic mapping between luminance and pitch in chimpanzee suggests the emergence of an early vocabulary of human language (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ramachandran and Hubbard, 2001</a>), we here expand this finding to a cross-modal correspondence between vision and an abstract domain: the social status. A natural tendency to systematically map an abstract dimension, such as social status, in our closest and nonlinguistic relatives, the chimpanzees, suggests that this tendency had already evolved in the common ancestors of humans and chimpanzees. This tendency might have influenced the emergence of metaphorical linguistics, thinking via image schema, an embodied pre-linguistic structure of experience that motivates conceptual metaphor mappings (<a href=\"#bib11\">Lakoff and Johnson, 1980a</a>). According to Lakoff (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lakoff and Johnson, 1980b</a>), orientational metaphors, such as \u2018more is up\u2019, \u2018good is up\u2019 and \u2018dominant is up\u2019, are based on observational correlation between increasing a substance and seeing the level of the substance rise, like adding an element to a pile. Given the strong physical basis, these metaphors are good candidate for universal concepts. Until now, conceptual metaphors have been exclusive human experiences. Our findings point in a different direction."
