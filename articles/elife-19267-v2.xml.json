We now show conversely that transient elevations of cytoplasmic Ca strongly regulate cardiac Na/K pumps. When cytoplasmic Na is submaximal, Na/K pump currents decay rapidly during extracellular K application and multiple results suggest that an inactivation mechanism is involved. Brief activation of Ca influx by reverse Na/Ca exchange enhances pump currents and attenuates current decay, while repeated Ca elevations suppress pump currents. Pump current enhancement reverses over 3 min, and results are similar in myocytes lacking the regulatory protein, phospholemman. Classical signaling mechanisms, including Ca-activated protein kinases and reactive oxygen, are evidently not involved. Electrogenic signals mediated by intramembrane movement of hydrophobic ions, such as hexyltriphenylphosphonium (C6TPP), increase and decrease in parallel with pump currents. Thus, transient Ca elevation and Na/K pump inactivation cause opposing sarcolemma changes that may affect diverse membrane processes."

As a result, the concentration of sodium ions inside cells is low in comparison to the concentration outside, and vice versa for potassium ions. These differences between inside and outside concentrations are a source of energy for cells to do a variety of important tasks, similar to using energy that is stored in a reservoir formed by a dam. When cells allow ions to move in the direction they naturally move, similar to water moving over a dam, they carry out two important roles. First, they generate electrical signals that are the basis of all fast communication in nerves and muscles. Second, they can force important molecules to be moved into or out of cells in a specific way, thereby making the inside composition of cells different from the outside."

In cardiac myocytes, small changes of pump activity have large effects on excitation-contraction coupling by shifting the energetic equilibrium of Na/Ca exchangers (<a href=\"#bib64\">Reuter et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hilgemann, 2004</a>).

                        "text": "Surprisingly, cardiac Na/K pump regulation remains rather enigmatic. The FXYD protein, phospholemman, can inhibit Na/K pumps with analogy to phospholamban action at SERCA Ca pumps, and this inhibition is proposed to be released when phospholemman is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKAs) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bibert et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mishra et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, phosphorylation of phospholemman by PKAs appears to increase the affinity of pumps for cytoplasmic Na, while phosphorylation of phospholemman by protein kinase Cs (PKCs) increases maximal pump activity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Han et al., 2006</a>). These effects appear robust in optical experiments with Na-sensitive dyes, but without control of membrane potential, while the equivalent results in patch clamp-controlled experiments are remarkably inconsistent. During whole cell patch clamp of cardiac myocytes, activation of PKAs has been reported to duplicate results with dyes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Despa et al., 2005</a>), to mildly stimulate pump currents under all experimental conditions (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kockskamper et al., 2000</a>), to have no effect (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ishizuka and Berlin, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Main et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fine et al., 2013</a>), or to inhibit pump currents via an oxidative mechanism (<a href=\"#bib20\">Galougahi et al., 2013</a>). One analysis suggests that phosphorylation by PKA <i>inhibits</i> pump activity in the absence of Ca, but overcomes an inhibitory action of Ca and thereby <i>enhances</i> pump activity, albeit modestly, in the presence of cytoplasmic Ca (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gao et al., 1996</a>). Results for PKCs are similarly complex and presumably reflect complexities of PKC signaling in cardiac myocytes. Both small stimulatory effects (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gao et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Han et al., 2006</a>) and inhibitory effects (<a href=\"#bib76\">White et al., 2009</a>) are reported, the latter occurring through oxidative stress signaling mechanisms. Na/K pumps are evidently regulated by trafficking mechanisms in some cell types (<a href=\"#bib2\">Al-Khalili et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Liu and Shapiro, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lecuona et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alves et al., 2015</a>), but there is little support for physiological regulation of cardiac pumps by these mechanisms. Nonconventional endocytic mechanisms can remove pumps from the sarcolemma during reperfusion injury (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). Other mechanisms proposed to regulate the activity of Na/K pumps in cardiac myocytes include redox-dependent glutathionylation of the beta subunits of Na/K pumps (<a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) and the modulation of phospholemman function by palmitoylation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Tulloch et al., 2011</a>)."

Attempting to stop and/or reverse this run-down, it became evident that a brief elevation of cytoplasmic Ca via reverse Na/Ca exchange had substantially larger effects on pump activity than the activation of either PKAs or PKCs. As described here, the stimulatory effects of transient Ca elevation, usually associated with spontaneous beating, occur as an apparent increase of the cytoplasmic Na affinity of Na/K pumps, the same functional effect proposed to occur with PKA activation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Despa et al., 2005</a>). Subsequent to a transient Ca elevation, peak pump currents activated by extracellular K are strongly enhanced, and the current decay that occurs during continued K application is attenuated. This decay has been ascribed previously to depletion of cytoplasmic Na in a restricted space (Fujioka et al.; <a href=\"#bib70\">Su et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Verdonck et al., 2004</a>), and we explore here the possibility that current decay reflects instead, or additionally, an inactivation mechanism that bears similarity to the Na-dependent inactivation of Na/Ca exchangers (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hilgemann et al., 1992b</a>). In contrast to Na/Ca exchangers, inactivation of Na/K pumps would not occur when cytoplasmic binding sites are occupied by Na. Rather, it would occur when one or more Na binding sites are unoccupied, while recovery from inactivation would be promoted by Na binding. We do not discern any effect of PKA activation in the absence of Ca elevations and the stimulatory effects of Ca elevation occur similarly in phospholemman-deficient myocytes. Further results suggest that physical changes of the membrane itself may be involved, rather than classical signaling mechanisms, and that Na transporters in close vicinity to one another may interact functionally by modifying physical properties of the adjacent bilayer."

We hypothesize that Na/K pumps in intact murine myocytes can enter into long-lived inactive states when they are in E1 configurations. Specifically, we hypothesize that pumps inactivate preferentially when the Na-selective binding site (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kanai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Vedovato and Gadsby, 2014</a>) is not occupied by Na, while recovery from inactivation may be favored by Na binding to all sites. Inactivation could in principle be a process that hinders Na binding and/or hinders pump phosphorylation, therefore preventing the completion of a forward pump cycle. Transient cytoplasmic Ca elevations may act to attenuate Na/K pump inactivation via membrane modifications mediated by lipid-modifying enzymes <i>or</i> by long-lived conformational changes of high-density membrane-associated proteins.,"

Hypothetically, Na/K pump current decay occurs as an inactivation reaction taking place preferentially (but probably not exclusively) from 'E1' states in which the Na-selective ion binding site is not occupied by Na. Inactivation might occur with a lower probability from other states, including E2 states. Recovery from inactivation may be promoted by Na binding to inactive exchangers."

In contrast, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> is a representative current record using a cytoplasmic solution with 90\u2009mM K and 25\u2009mM Na. In the presence of cytoplasmic K and with this lower cytoplasmic Na concentration, the pump current activated by extracellular K (7\u2009mM) amounts to 2.4\u2009pA/pF and immediately begins to decline, approaching a steady state over 10 to 15\u2009s. The decaying current component typically amounts to more than one-half of the peak current. Importantly for our subsequent analysis, membrane capacitance typically decreases abruptly by 0.5 to 1% upon application of extracellular K and then declines further, but to a lesser extent, as pump current falls during K exposure. Upon removal of K, the capacitance signal returns toward its baseline with a slow multi-second time course that mimics in our experience the availability of pump currents for activation by renewed application of extracellular K. To test for sensitivity to heart glycosides, the myocyte was moved into two separate solution streams containing ouabain at a concentration that was high enough (0.3\u2009mM) to effectively block rodent Na/K pumps (<a href=\"#bib30\">Herzig and Mohr, 1984</a>). The currents were very effectively inhibited by ouabain (n\u00a0=\u00a05), demonstrating that they indeed reflect Na/K pump activity. Importantly, the transient capacitive signals, as well as pump currents, are ablated by ouabain, indicating that they likely arise from Na/K pumps."

These currents showed unusually strong decay (&gt;90%) in spite of their small magnitude, such that the apparent mixing volume of Li would be substantially less than a picoliter. This result is consistent with the inactivation model because more binding sites will be empty with a low affinity pump ligand, thereby promoting inactivation.

In equivalent experiments using rat myocytes, Verdonck et al. described that as cytoplasmic Na is increased from 0 to 100\u2009mM, the rate constant that best describes pump current decay increases to a maximum with nearly the same Na dependence as pump current itself (<a href=\"#bib75\">Verdonck et al., 2004</a>). This result seems inconsistent with the Na depletion model. If current decay were occurring as a result of Na depletion, the rate constant should have decreased as Na was increased above the half-maximal Na concentration of 8\u2009mM and up to 100\u2009mM. Furthermore, the fractional decay of current should have decreased markedly at the higher Na concentrations. Rather, the result supports an inactivation model in which the Na binding to inactive states promote recovery from inactivation. The kinetic results from our experiments were somewhat more complex: In the experiments described in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> at 23\u00b0C, the initial rate of pump current decay <i>increased</i> as cytoplasmic Na was <i>decreased</i> from 0.06 \u00b1 0.02\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> at 40\u2009mM Na to 0.14 \u00b1 0.02\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> at 2.5\u2009mM Na. This favors our suggestion that inactivation occurs preferentially from E1 states that are not fully occupied by Na. Nevertheless, as evident subsequently in Figure 6B at 37\u00b0C, current decay can also accelerate as the fractional current decay becomes smaller at high cytoplasmic Na concentrations."

In other words, both extracellular Na and Ca promote accumulation of E1 states and favor inactivation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Matsuoka and Hilgemann, 1994</a>). When experiments are performed in the presence of cytoplasmic Na and in the absence of extracellular Ca and Na, transporters initially accumulate in the E2 configuration that does not allow inactivation. Then, when Ca is applied to activate reverse transport (i.e. Ca influx), transporters shift to the E1 configuration and inactivation is promoted. When extracellular Na is applied <i>before</i> applying Ca, large fractions of the exchangers shift to the E1 configuration and inactivate without transporting Ca. That inactivation then becomes evident when Ca is applied without Na. For Na/K pumps the equivalent experiments will not normally be possible because the <i>reverse</i> pump reactions, which move bound Na within E2 to E1 configurations, require that for cytoplasmic Na release the pump is dephosphorylated and that ATP is synthesized. These reverse reactions require, in addition to extracellular Na, high cytoplasmic concentrations of ADP. As described in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, appropriate experiments are readily possible to test this prediction by selecting conditions that promote cytoplasmic accumulation of ADP."

At the start of the experimental record, pump current was activated twice by moving the myocyte from a solution with 5\u2009mM Na to one with 5\u2009mM K. When 5\u2009mM Na is replaced with 5\u00a0mM NMG, a small outward current develops that decays partially over 20\u2009s, as expected for a pump current, and application of 5\u2009mM K then activates a maximal pump current that is less than half of the previous pump currents. Return to a solution with 5\u2009mM Na restores the pump currents. Application of 15\u2009mM Na enhances pump currents only about 10% beyond peak currents obtained after incubation with 5\u2009mM Na. We conclude therefore that 5\u2009mM Na suppresses most of the pump activity supported by residual K in these solutions.

We also tested in 6 experiments the ability of tetraethylammonium (TEA) to rescue pump current, since TEA binds to E2 potassium sites without being transported (<a href=\"#bib62\">Peluffo et al., 2004</a>). As expected, 120\u2009mM TEA rescued pump activity equally well as 120\u2009mM Na. However, much higher TEA concentrations were required than Na concentrations. The effect of 20\u2009mM was very small, and the concentration dependence was concave upward with no evidence of saturation."

Removal of Na without application of K activates a small current, and the pump current activated subsequently with 5 mM K is less than one-half of the control pump current. Thus, pumps inactivate in nominally Na free solution, presumably because pump activity supported by contaminating K is adequate to allow inactivation. Pump currents recover in the presence of 5 mM Na, and the application of 15 mM has very little further rescue effect. From 6 experiments, employing 5, 15 and 120 mM Na, the half-maximal Na concentration required to rescue pump currents was 2.3 mM. (<b>B</b>) Under standard conditions, 120 mM Na was applied, instead of NMG, for 30 s before applying K in the absence of Na. Peak pump currents were increased by 13% on average, compared to currents activated after incubation with 7 mM Na. (<b>B</b>) Na/K pump inactivation is promoted by conditions that allow backward pump reactions from E2 to E1 states. With 10 mM deoxyglucose in the pipette solution, to promote ATP hydrolysis and generation of ADP by hexokinsaes, pump currents ran down slowly over several minutes. After application of 120 mM Na for 30 s, peak pump currents activated by K were decreased to nearly their 15\u00a0s value, as expected if inactivation had occurred in the presence of extracellular Na. This result verifies a key prediction of the inactivation model presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>."

Equivalent to the experiment of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, we first activated pump current as usual by replacing 6\u2009mM Na with 6\u2009mM K. Then, we switched to 120\u2009mM Na (instead of NMG) for 40\u2009s and reactivated the pump current with 6\u2009mM extracellular K. The potentiation of current by 120\u2009mM Na versus 7\u2009mM amounted to 13 \u00b1 3%, a change that is in good agreement with the K<sub>d</sub> of 2.3\u2009mM. Thus, the activation of pump currents that occurs with increasing extracellular Na (<a href=\"#bib23\">Garcia et al., 2013</a>) can be accounted for entirely by Na competition with contaminating K, thereby rescuing pumps from steady state inactivation.."

Initially, we simply included 5\u2009mM ADP in the pipette solution, together with 5\u2009mM ATP. Peak pump currents then decreased significantly, but modestly, when extracellular Na was applied before pump current activation, as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. In this connection, we report that changes of nucleotides (e.g. use of 0.5\u2009mM ATP versus 12\u2009mM) in the pipette solutions in general had very little influence on pump currents, and in fact pump currents remained stable for periods of minutes with no added ATP. Clearly, ATP regenerating systems are very powerful in myocytes, and we therefore considered other means to decrease the ATP/ADP ratio. We included 10\u2009mM deoxyglucose in the pipette solution with the expectation that hexokinases would rapidly phosphorylate deoxyglucose and thereby increase cytoplasmic ADP (<a href=\"#bib66\">Russell et al., 1992</a>). As apparent in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, Na/K pump currents then ran down progressively over 5\u2009min. After substitution of 120\u2009mM extracellular NMG by 120\u2009mM Na for 40\u2009s, the peak pump currents activated by K in the absence of extracellular Na were decreased by 35% on average. Furthermore, currents activated during application of extracellular K showed very little decay, as expected if inactivation had already occurred in the presence of extracellular Na. We report finally that similar results were often obtained <i>without</i> deoxyglucose when myocytes were employed more than 4\u2009hr after isolation, consistent with a time-dependent run-down of ATP-regenerating systems."

Pump currents were activated, as usual, by replacing 7\u2009mM Na for 7\u2009mM K on the extracellular side in the presence of 25\u2009mM Na and 90\u2009mM K on the cytoplasmic side. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, currents decayed by ~70% with a time constant of ~ 2\u2009s. As evident in the second half of the recording, the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (0.5 \u03bcM), applied by shifting the myocyte to two separate solution lines containing the drug, caused no evident change of the activation-decay pattern or current magnitudes. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> shows composite results for isoproterenol in individual myocytes from 5 different myocyte preparations. Similar to results for isoproterenol, we also did not observe significant effects of the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (20\u2009\u03bcM). Furthermore, no significant changes of the current decay and run-down patterns were observed when cAMP (2\u2009mM) was included in the pipette solution. These results reiterate negative results using human iCell myocytes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fine et al., 2013</a>). In contrast to results for PKAs, we did observe small stimulatory effects of the PKC activator, rac-1-oleyl-2-acetyl- glycerol (OAG, 5\u2009\u03bcM) on peak pump currents (~25%), similar to results of others (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2010</a>).

Myocytes initiate a series of rapid contractions in this protocol, documented subsequently to involve Ca waves. Typically, contractile activity continues for a few seconds after exchange currents are deactivated. Contractions then stop and myocytes remain fully extended thereafter. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> illustrates the prominent after-effects transient Ca elevations when cytoplasmic Na is submaximal (25\u2009mM with 90\u2009mM K). During 15 to 40\u2009s after the Ca elvation, membrane capacitance routinely increased by 3 to 6%. Within this same time frame, peak pump currents activated by extracellular K increased on average by 54%, and current decay during a 12\u2009s K pulse was decreased from 70% to about 20%. Pump currents at 10\u00a0s were typically increased by three-fold. Over the course of 3 min, the Na/K pump currents returned to their initial wave form. Bar graphs to the right of the experimental record quantify representative results for 12 experiments, each using a myocyte from a different myocyte batch. We point out that these effects are the largest modulatory effects observed routinely on Na/K pump currents in the experience of this group. Further, we report that the myosin ii inhibitor, blebbistatin, at a high concentration (5\u2009\u03bcM) blocked the observed contractile activity but did not block these effects (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Bar graphs to the right of the experimental record give composite results for 8 similar experiments.

We demonstrate in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, however, that much larger sustained Na fluxes can be generated by Na/Ca exchangers than are carried by Na pumps. For these experiments, we employed myocytes that overexpress NCX1 Na/Ca exchangers by at least five-fold in relation to WT expression levels (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lin et al., 2013</a>) and that generate several nanoamperes of reverse exchange current in equivalent experiments. To limit the magnitude of Ca changes and to avoid excessive contraction, we employed heavily Ca- and pH-buffered pipette solutions without K (50\u2009mM EGTA, 12\u2009mM Ca, 50\u2009mM HEPES, and 20\u2009mM Na; resting free Ca, ~0.2\u2009\u03bcM). Peak Na/K pump currents in these myocytes were not different in magnitude from WT myocytes (~2\u2009pA/pF with 20\u2009mM Na), but they decayed nearly completely. Peak exchange currents amounted to &gt;20\u2009pA/pF, and they decayed to a magnitude of 430 \u00b1 33\u2009pA after 20\u2009s. Impressively, the maintained exchange current magnitudes approximate the maximal Na flux that can be expected for an access resistance of 3 M\u03a9 and a pipette Na concentration that amounts to 7% of all diffusible ions (i.e. 20\u2009mM out of 300\u2009mM with ion fluxes calculated from a constant field equation and assuming a 3Na/1Ca exchange stoichiometry). The total magnitude of Ca influx during each episode of exchange current amounts to more than 10 mmol/Liter of cytoplasmic space, assuming a cell volume of 30 pL. In response to these Ca elevations, peak Na/K pump currents doubled in magnitude and the 10\u2009s current magnitudes increased from negligible values to 76 \u00b1 6\u2009pA (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Clearly, it becomes difficult to explain these current patterns in terms of a restricted subsarcolemmal Na space shared by Na/K pumps and Na/Ca exchangers. The total amount of Na moved during the initial Na pump current over 20\u00a0s is subseqeuntly moved by Na/Ca exchangers within just a few milliseconds. Therefore, one must assume that the Na space available to Na pumps is very small (&lt;1 pL), while that available to Na/Ca exchangers is very larger. Either the two transporters do not share the same Na space, or else Ca influx dramatically expands the space within milliseconds."

As necessary for optical measurements, the recordings were performed using mycoytes attached to cover slips, and solutions were changed with a device in which two solution lines shared a common volume outflow. Therefore, solution changes were not as abrupt as in routine experiments. Perhaps for this reason, or as a result of dye loading, myocytes did not visually contract as vigorously as in routine experiments. Nevertheless, the overall patterns were very similar. The whole-cell fluorescence is presented as the middle record in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, and the upper trace is a time-expanded record for a cross-sectional optical slice taken roughly in the middle of the myocyte. The cross-section record documents the occurrence of profuse Ca waves which follow closely our routine observations of contraction. Ca waves become increasingly pronounced and rapid as the Ca signal declines. Thereafter, Ca waves decrease in magnitude and eventually in frequency. During application of extracellular Ca, the Fluor4 fluorescence increased on average 3.7 \u00b1 0.4 fold (n\u00a0=\u00a07). This corresponds to a peak free Ca of 2.7 \u00b5M, calculated with K<sub>d</sub> for Ca of 300 nM and a background free Ca of 0.13\u2009\u03bcM. Free Ca decays with a time constant of ~15\u2009s. Importantly, the cytoplasmic Ca changes can be reproduced with good precision after 3\u2009min. In this experiment the first and second exchange currents were similar in magnitude, but we describe next that exchange currents can change substantially. We conclude from these measurements that during the routine Ca elevation protocols free Ca rises to at least 2 and probably 3\u2009\u03bcM, and that Ca returns nearly to baseline within 15 to 30\u2009s."

This behavior indicates that the current depends directly on extracellular Ca and therefore is indeed Na/Ca exchange current, rather than a cytoplasmic Ca-activated nonspecific current that would turn off with the slower time course of the cytoplasmic Ca decline. In conclusion, Ca-dependent mechanisms enhance both Na/K pump and Na/Ca exchange activities for periods of more than one minute after a transient Ca elevation.

As illustrated in the record in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, the outward Na/Ca exchange currents ran down in close parallel to pump currents. This parallel run-down was usually associated with a fall of membrane capacitance, reflecting Ca-activated endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>). But even when the loss of membrane area was small, about 10% in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, pump currents were strongly suppressed, usually ablated. Thus, transient Ca elevations have both facilitating and inhibiting effects on both Na/K pump currents and Na/Ca exchange currents. While the stimulatory effects invariably reversed over 3\u2009min, reversal of inhibitory effects of repeated Ca elevations was highly variable."

Therefore, the rapid phosphorylation of deoxyglucose by hexokinases, at the expense of ATP, is likely to be the cause of run-down in these experiments, rather than mechanisms downstream of deoxyglucose-6-phosphate. As summarized in the Table in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, inward HTPP currents decreased in parallel with pump currents, on average by 69%. Furthermore, HTPP currents were stable when deoxyglucose was not included in the pipette, and HTPP currents decreased by 51% when the pipette solutions contained 140\u2009mM K, instead of NMG, and no Na. Thus, the membrane changes that occur with deoxyglucose do not appear to depend on Na-dependent Na/K pump conformational changes.

Conformational changes of the Na/K pump per se may also affect these dyes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fedosova et al., 1995</a>). With this background, we tested whether conformational changes of Na/K pumps during pump current elevations might affect the currents carried by HTTP. As shown in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>, HTTP currents were indeed decreased by ~30% immediately after removing extracellular K to deactivate Na/K pumps. Furthermore, the HTTP currents routinely recovered with a time course that was similar to the recovery of pump current from inactivation. Note that the recovery of capacitance also followed this time course. In this context, we point out that Na/K pumps are present in the mouse sarcolemma at a high density. Pump density must be &gt;2000 per \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> to account for maximal currents of 4\u2009pA/pF with maximal transport rates of ~300\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gadsby and Nakao, 1989</a>).

The functional consequence will presumably be a down-regulation of basal cardiac contractility, thereby completing a negative-feedback loop in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Na/K pumps are very well poised to fulfill this function: Na/K pump activity in the presence of cytoplasmic K has a steep dependence on cytoplasmic Na (Hill coefficients\u00a0&gt;\u00a02; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Therefore, Na/K pumps minimize changes of cytoplasmic Na whenever Na influx increases or decreases. By minimizing the influence of Na influx, and therefore of Na-conducting ion channels, Na/K pumps emerge as singularly powerful regulators of basal cardiac contractility (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hilgemann, 2004</a>)."

Our results now raise the possibility that Ca transients regulate cardiac Na/K pumps independent of cAMP, and that cAMP-dependent kinases will to a <i>greater-or-lesser</i> extent up-regulate Na/K pump activity secondary to their well- known actions to enhance myoycte Ca transients. In the presence of saturating cytoplasmic Na, pump currents are not increased by Ca elevations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Thus, attenuation of the <i>putative</i> inactivation reaction by Ca elevations duplicates the apparent increase of Na affinity ascribed to phospholemman phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2010</a>). An interesting parallel to our results is the description of Na/K pump activation in skeletal muscle by a train of rapid excitations, reviewed recently (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clausen, 2013</a>). Although extracellular K definitely accumulates in skeletal muscle T-tubules during rapid action potential firing, and thereby promotes Na/K pump activity (<a href=\"#bib14\">DiFranco et al., 2015</a>), this mechanism cannot explain why ouabain-sensitive rubidium uptake is strongly enhanced by skeletal muscle activity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buchanan et al., 2002</a>).

Nevertheless, multiple groups were able to measure significant changes of cytoplasmic Na in myocytes during activation of Na/K pump currents (<a href=\"#bib70\">Su et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Despa and Bers, 2003</a>), albeit on longer time scales than current decay in the present experiments. Thus, the faster components of Na/K pump current decay have remained open to other interpretations. The fact that Na/K pump activity causes a parallel decline of Na/Ca exchange activity (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A</a>) is a very persuasive argument for Na depletion, although the present work suggests a plausible alternative. Given that hydrophobic cation currents decrease in parallel with Na/K pump current decay (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>), it is likely that significant membrane changes are occurring and the possibility thus arises that Na pump inactivation might regulate Na/Ca exchange function by mechanisms that are independent of Na concentration changes. That Na/K pumps might physically influence Na/Ca exchangers within protein complexes was suggested already by <a href=\"#bib70\">Su et al. (1998)</a> in this same context. This might be possible if inactivation involves unusual physical changes of pump structure, as might occur with dimerization, and that might mechanically influence the bilayer as well as interacting protein networks. Alternatively, inactivation might control an enzymatic activity that alters the membrane, similar to the long-standing (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tian et al., 2006</a>) but still controversial (<a href=\"#bib78\">Yosef et al., 2016</a>) hypothesis that Na/K pumps directly regulate Src kinases."

Using highly Ca-buffered pipette solutions, activation of Na/K pumps by extracellular K caused a time-dependent decrease of Na/Ca exchange currents with no change of reversal potential, as expected if Na/K pumps physically regulate Na/Ca exchangers. However, Na/Ca exchange reversal potentials changed markedly during recovery from pump activity, as if subsarcolemmal Na had been depleted during pump activity and recovered after termination of pump activity. Clearly, this issue requires further work. The measurement of Na channel reversal potentials might be more decisive than Na/Ca exchange reversals because the stoichiometry of NCX1 Na/Ca exchange operation is not completely fixed and may be subject to regulatory changes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kang and Hilgemann, 2004</a>)."

Thus, Na/K pumps probably do not immediately return to an E2 configuration when pump activity is terminated. (2)\u00a0Na/K pump current decay occurs to the same fractional extent at 23 and 37\u00b0C, although pump currents are about four-times smaller at the lower temperature (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). (3) The inclusion of cytoplasmic K in pipette solutions decreases the apparent cytoplasmic Na affinity and thereby decreases pump current densities when Na is submaximal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>). Nevertheless, the fractional decay of pump currents is increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). (4)\u00a0Current decay is very strong when a high Li concentration (40\u2009mM) is used as a Na surrogate and pump currents are three-fold smaller than in our standard conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). (5)\u00a0We have verified a key prediction for the inactivation model, suggested in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Application of extracellular Na under conditions that promote accumulation of cytoplasmic ADP suppresses the transient phase of pump currents, such that pump currents activate to approximately their quasi steady state (15\u2009s) magnitude without a peak followed by current decay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). (6) Myocytes can support outward Na/Ca exchange currents that are many times larger than pump currents (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Within the context of a Na depletion model, one must assume that Na/Ca exchangers have access to a much larger restricted space than Na/K pumps in those myocytes, or alternatively that the restricted space and/or Na diffusion rates are strongly enhanced within a very short time by Ca influx. (7) A large, continuous Na influx via forward Na/Ca exchange fails to enhance pump currents, although the operation of pumps can depress reverse exchange currents (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>). (8)\u00a0The fractional decay of pump currents often increases as currents decline over time, a behavior that is opposite to the pattern expected for an ion depletion mechanism (e.g. <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Finally, as noted in Results, the rate of pump current decay does not decrease as cytoplasmic Na is increased into the saturation range for pump activity (<a href=\"#bib75\">Verdonck et al., 2004</a>)."

During a maintained average pump current of 300\u2009pA, about 2 mmole ATP per liter cytoplasm will be cleaved every 10\u2009s in a 20 pL cell. In the physiological setting, these nucleotide changes must be very rapidly countered by ATP regeneration via glycolysis and/or oxidative phosphorylation. On the one hand, extensive local depletion of ATP might be an immediate cause of pump current decay during metabolic stress. On the other hand, our work suggests that ADP accumulation during metabolic stress will favor occupancy of states that can inactivate. Independent of Na/K pump function, it appears that significant membrane changes are occurring rapidly in the presence of metabolic stress (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>)."

In both a 'Na depletion' model <i>and</i> an 'inactivation' model, a genuine increase of Na/K pump Na affinity will of course cause an increase of peak pump currents when extracellular K is applied. Qualitatively, a genuine increase of Na affinity can also explain changes of pump current decay that occur. In a depletion model, cytoplasmic Na must decrease more extensively to cause a fall of pump current when the Na affinity is increased. In an inactivation model, a higher Na affinity attenuates inactivation because the number of E1 pumps without a bound Na would be decreased. In this context, the existence of a labile, hydrophobic Na antagonist would go quite far to explain many results. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to evoke a genuine change of Na affinity to explain these results. One possible extension of the inactivation model is that pumps inactivate at multiple points in the pump cycle, including E2 states. If transient Ca elevation favors the recovery from <i>multiple</i> inactive states, not just those immediately coupled to E1 conformations, peak pump currents will increase without evoking a genuine increase of Na affinity."

Further, it appears important that the effects of Ca elevation in intact myocytes have no clear parallels in biochemical pump studies.

One reason could be that giant excised patches are highly stretched membranes which probably lack actin membrane cytoskeleton. On the other hand, pump currents in excised patches routinely show an initial 'run-up' that is consistent with the irreversible loss of an endogenous pump inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hilgemann, 1997</a>).

Cardiac (NCX1) Na/Ca exchangers have a large cytoplasmic regulatory domain with multiple Ca binding sites that effectively responds to changes of the time integral of cytoplasmic free Ca (Matsuoka, 1993). Both conformational changes per se of this domain (<a href=\"#bib40\">John et al., 2011</a>) and its activating influence on Na/Ca exchange function (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hilgemann et al., 1992a</a>) <i>can</i> persist for longer than one minute after cytoplasmic Ca declines. Thus, the cytoplasmic NCX1 domain is one potential Ca sensor for the activation of Na/K pumps by Ca elevation. Conformational information would be transferred to Na/K pumps via cytoskeleton, the bilayer, and/or an enzymatic activity. The existence of physical interactions between neighboring transporters, independent of Na concentration changes, is an attractive explanation for findings that specific Na/K pump isoforms regulate cardiac excitation-contraction coupling in a specific manner (<a href=\"#bib65\">Rindler et al., 2013</a>). As concerns the Na depletion hypothesis, the physical basis of a restricted subsarcolemmal Na space with multi-second Na exchange remains to be established. We stress that our results do not at this time rigorously exclude its existence.

Transient Ca elevations attenuate Na/K pump current decay by mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. Common Ca-dependent protein kinases and phosphatases do not appear to be involved, and the underlying mechanisms result in physical changes of the membrane that can be detected by multiple nonspecific membrane probes. The Ca-dependent mechanisms that modulate Na/K pumps may also modulate the function of Na/Ca exchangers, and the involvement of membrane per se suggests that other membrane-coupled processes might also be affected."

Solutions employing 20 and 50\u2009mM EGTA were prepared by first dissolving EGTA with NMG to give a neutral pH, followed by boiling with the required amounts of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. The final osmolarity of all solutions was 290 mosmol/L. In experiments examining the cytoplasmic Na dependence of pump currents with K, K was reduced from 90 to 70\u2009mM in the K-containing solutions employed, and NMG was substituted for Na. NMG was substituted for cytoplasmic K in experiments without K."

At least as important, they provide evidence for possible modulation of that inactivation by manipulations that raise cytoplasmic Ca concentration. Shockingly, the magnitude of the modulation identifies it as probably the largest physiological regulator of cardiac Na/K pump function found to date. Moreover, the authors' exhaustive search for the underlying Ca-dependent modulatory pathway seems to have ruled out all the usual suspects, forcing them to consider effects mediated by changes in physico-chemical properties of the cell membrane itself."

The data include measurements of cell membrane current and capacitance, or cytoplasmic Ca concentration. Not surprisingly, among the wealth of experimental information are findings that prompt further questions. Obvious ones are what are the origin and mechanism of the extracellular K-induced decrease in the capacitance signal, which is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> to be ouabain sensitive, and which recovers relatively slowly (10s of sec) after K withdrawal with a time course that seems to mimic both recovery of Na/K pumps from inactivation and recovery of hydrophobic cation current amplitude from K-induced depression (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>)? Could the capacitance signal in the absence of K include a component of charge movement within the Na-bound phosphorylated Na/K pumps that is then lost when K binds and drives the Na/K exchange evident as net outward current? (Those pump charge movements are known to be diminished at low external Na concentration, but might be evident in high-resolution measurements). Could the slow recovery of that capacitance signal reflect unbinding of the last K ion, given the pump's expected \u03bcM K affinity in the near absence of external Na, the millimolar concentration of K applied, and the possibility of diffusion-limited spaces containing high-affinity K binding sites (T-system, between sarcolemma and coverslip)? A pump origin for that capacitance component is supported by its abolition by ouabain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and by its doubling when pump cycling current was similarly doubled (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). If so, the latter parallel changes in the capacitive and stationary pump current signals could imply a temporary increase in the number of functioning pumps following episodes of Ca entry. The authors acknowledge that increased membrane capacitance after Ca entry could reflect membrane fusion events, but argue that the implied overall ~2% increase in membrane area is hard to reconcile with doubling of pump currents. But if the reversibly inserted membrane were specialized \u2013 e.g. T-tubular or caveolar \u2013 perhaps this might be possible? A little further discussion of ramifications of the clearly documented capacitance signal changes would help the interested reader."

Calcium transients are mentioned in the Title, Abstract, Introduction and first sentence of the Results, and the \"stimulatory effects of Ca transients\" are introduced in the last paragraph of the Introduction and in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, whose title attributes the stimulation to \"a train of excitation-contraction coupling cycles\". The text reasonably clarifies that entry of extracellular Ca via reverse Na/Ca exchange triggers a series of contractions by Ca-induced Ca release, which stops on Ca withdrawal; that text does not mention Ca transients. Nor does the next paragraph, though its title announces \"Repeated Ca transients\u2026\" and it describes effects of \"two consecutive Ca influx protocols\" and, later, of \"a second Ca influx episode\". Those latter usages suggest that a Ca transient means an episode of Ca influx, whereas the previous paragraph might be read as implying that a Ca transient is a single Ca-induced Ca release event, many of which occur during a Ca influx episode. The confusion is not helped by phrases like \"the first pump current transient after the Ca transient\" (subsection \u201cStimulatory effects of Ca transients do not appear to involve classical signaling pathways\u201d), or \"effects of extended Ca transients\" (subsection \u201cPhysiological regulation of cardiac Na/K pumps by Ca transients\u201d). If the phrase \"Ca transient\" is retained it will be essential to define it clearly early on (e.g., transient increase of cytoplasmic Ca concentration) and then to use it consistently."

The results do not offer a clear mechanistic explanation but nevertheless are significant because they extend established ideas about regulation of Ca(i) by Na/K pump activity and show that reciprocal regulation of exchange and pump activity occurs, and further that this regulation involves mechanisms independent of previously examined candidates like kinase activity, phospholemman, and redox changes. The authors also rigorously analyze and highlight discrepancies between data and predictions of models of inactivation due solely to ion depletion. Further, the authors use hydrophobic ions to show that changes in membrane properties accompany regulatory changes of pump activity. The strength of the work is its rigor and demonstration of a potentially quite important phenomenon in cardiac myocyte physiology, as well as in presenting some potential challenges to current ideas. Its weakness stems from the fact that the mechanisms underlying key observations remain largely obscure. Although the work may be criticized as descriptive, the phenomena are novel and will certainly stimulate further work."

The authors suggest that capacitance changes likely reflect physical changes in addition to membrane trafficking, which is an interesting idea based in part on niflumic acid and C6TPP effects on capacitance, but this mechanism and connection is unfortunately somewhat obscure. Still, an important idea raised by the work is the potential physiological significance of modulation of pump activity by Ca(i), and the existence of a potential feedback loop with linkage to capacitance/physical membrane changes. A single exchanger-mediated Ca transient induces capacitance decrease, repetitive Ca transients induce a large increase, and a single large Ca transient (using FPL64176) induces a decrease. This apparent frequency effect is not discussed; is there any potential mechanistic explanation for apparent dependence on frequency of transients versus quantity of Ca(i)? In addition, the niflumic acid-induced capacitance change after Ca transients increased, but was \u03b4 C/C changed? This is important with respect to the postulated relationship between Ca regulation and membrane changes."

A prediction of the authors' inactivation model is borne out by experiments designed to deplete ATP and suppress the transient overshoot phase but it would seem to be informative to further test whether increasing glucose or including ATP in the pipette blocked or reduced the pump current inactivation, increased the steady-state current, or changed recovery kinetics. It would also seem worthwhile to test whether ATP affected inhibition of pump currents induced by multiple Ca transients."

The authors should show that are no pre steady-state Ni washout currents that may be additive or occlusive with the pump current. This would strengthen the conclusion that presence or absence of inward exchanger current does not affect the amplitude of pump current as predicted by a depletion model (instead, inhibition of pump currents is seen in the face of enhanced exchange current). The authors state there is no effect of Ni under \"routine conditions\", is there also no direct effect of Ni on K-induced pump currents?"

Nevertheless, we had found that pump currents increased as K was increased in our experiments over the range of 3 to 7 mM, whereby we always exchanged equal concentration of extracellular Na for K. It became clear in the intervening period that this concentration dependence in fact represented the concentration dependence by which extracellular Na blocks pump activity that occurs as the result of contaminating K in typical experimental solutions. This problem has in fact been investigated thoroughly in the past by Rakowski et al., as referenced in the revised article. We now describe this situation carefully with reference to our standard experimental conditions (i.e. with reference to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and we include a new panel to our figure that describes effects of extracellular Na on pump currents (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In its present format, this figure now demonstrates (1) that extracellular Na at low concentrations rescues pumps from steady state inactivation, which occurs in nominally Na-free solutions as a result of contaminating K. It demonstrates (2) that this effect of extracellular Na occurs with such high affinity that 7 mM Na is adequate to rescue nearly 90% of pumps from inactivation. It demonstrates (3) that this mechanism likely accounts for previous suggestions that Na/K pumps have an extracellular regulatory Na binding site.

Also, ideally, the effects of Ca should also be observed in inside out patches.</i> "

We discuss now further the 'giant patch'. Unfortunately, all of these regulatory properties systems appear to be lost in the giant patch. We point out that this can be due to loss of cytoskeleton or some type of regulatory factor that diffuses away. We agree as well that the ADP may critical and that some giant patch experiments may be possible. However, as described in the section noted above, pump currents become very highly activated immediately when ATP is applied the first time. Possibly this effect reflects loss of an endogenous pump inhibitor and we have spent much time pursuing this area. But we have not yet found what is lost! Hopefully soon."

As concerns current magnitude, the murine pump currents at room temperature are just as large as the pump currents of other myocytes routinely studied at 37 C, e.g. guinea pig myocyte pump currents. Certainly, we prefer larger currents, but we are confident that the measurements at RT remain accurate."
