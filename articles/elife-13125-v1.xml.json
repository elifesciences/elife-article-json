However, an individual\u2019s ability to use information is likely to be dependent on phenotypic constraints operating at three successive steps: acquisition, application, and exploitation. We tested this novel framework by quantifying the sequential process of social information use with experimental food patches in wild baboons (<i>Papio ursinus</i>). We identified phenotypic constraints at each step of the information use sequence: peripheral individuals in the proximity network were less likely to acquire and apply social information, while subordinate females were less likely to exploit it successfully. Social bonds and personality also played a limiting role along the sequence. As a result of these constraints, the average individual only acquired and exploited social information on &lt;25% and &lt;5% of occasions. Our study highlights the sequential nature of information use and the fundamental importance of phenotypic constraints on this sequence."

Information can be acquired in two ways (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dall et al., 2005</a>): by interacting with the environment directly (personal information) or by attending to the behaviour of others (social information). Individuals benefit from both personal and social information in myriad contexts, including foraging, predator avoidance, and mate choice (<a href=\"#bib37\">Giraldeau et al., 2002</a>). Their use is moderated by their expense and reliability: personal information is usually reliable but costly and time consuming to collect, social information is less costly but more likely to become outdated and unreliable (<a href=\"#bib37\">Giraldeau et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Laland, 2004</a>). The low costs of social information also allow it to disseminate more rapidly across groups, such that it can play an important role in the formation of traditions and cultures (<a href=\"#bib76\">Whiten, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Castro and Toro, 2004</a>)."

Indeed, theory developed to explain the costs and benefits of information use usually assumes homogeneity within a population (e.g. <a href=\"#bib61\">Pradhan et al., 2012</a>). To understand individual variation in information use, either personal or social, we suggest it is helpful to decompose the process into a sequence of three steps: the acquisition of information, its application, and the exploitation of its benefits (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Up until now, many studies have implicitly assumed that these three steps are synonymous, but recent evidence indicates that information use is substantially more complex. In particular, <a href=\"#bib17\">Carter et al. (2014)</a> found that the time spent acquiring social information about a task did not correlate with subsequent performance (information application) in wild baboons (<i>Papio ursinus</i>), while <a href=\"#bib4\">Atton et al. (2012)</a> found differences in individual performance between task discovery (information acquisition) and task solving (information exploitation) in three-spine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>). The recognition of three sequential steps allows us to begin unpacking the complexity of information use, and to explore variation in the performance of different individuals at different points along the sequence. Distinct sensory and motor capabilities are likely to be involved at each stage, leading to different phenotypic constraints. As a result, individuals who are effective at one step may be less so at another, with significant implications for who captures the most benefits."

The importance of these constraints is likely to differ not only between individuals but also between populations and species. Here, we focus on social, behavioural and demographic constraints on the social information use sequence. To begin with, we consider the social phenotype, i.e., phenotypic traits that emerge from social interactions with others and are likely to be under selection, in this case individual dominance rank (<a href=\"#bib60\">Moore, 1993</a>) and position in the social network (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aplin et al., 2015</a>). Dominant animals can aggressively monopolise resources such as mates (<a href=\"#bib26\">Cowlishaw and Dunbar, 1991</a>) and food (<a href=\"#bib51\">Koenig, 2002</a>), limiting the opportunities for others to apply and exploit information that they have acquired either personally or socially about these resources. This can further lead to voluntary inhibition in the use of information by subordinate animals, e.g., low-ranked rhesus monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) only performed a socially-learnt task when high-ranked monkeys were not present (<a href=\"#bib32\">Drea and Wallen, 1999</a>). The social network will likely manifest constraints on different stages of the information use sequence depending on the type of association indexed by the network, i.e., associations according to spatiotemporal proximity or direct interactions. For instance, positions in proximity networks may affect an individual\u2019s opportunities for information acquisition, assuming individuals are more likely to acquire information from others with whom they are more frequently in visual contact (<a href=\"#bib24\">Coussi-Korbel and Fragaszy, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Voelkl and No\u00eb, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib73\">2010</a>), e.g., stickleback proximity networks predict the flow of information about the location of a novel task (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atton et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, positions in interaction networks may limit the application and exploitation of information about resources if social bonds are required to gain access to those resources (<a href=\"#bib40\">Henzi and Barrett, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Clarke et al., 2010</a>), e.g., vervet monkeys (<i>Chlorocebus aethiops</i>) allocate their social effort to access food provided by others (<a href=\"#bib35\">Fruteau et al., 2009</a>)."

We have previously shown that personality can affect both the first and second steps of the social information use sequence: calmer baboons were more likely to acquire social information but bolder individuals were more likely to apply it (<a href=\"#bib17\">Carter et al., 2014</a>). In geese (<i>Branta leucopsis</i>), personality affected the final step in the sequence: shyer geese were more likely to exploit social information to forage where other geese were successfully foraging (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kurvers et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, fast exploring great tits (<i>Parus major</i>) were more likely to apply social information and change their foraging behaviour to mirror a demonstrator\u2019s (<a href=\"#bib58\">Marchetti and Drent, 2000</a>)."

Juveniles may be more reliant on social information because adults have already acquired the necessary information to survive to adulthood (<a href=\"#bib36\">Galef and Laland, 2005</a>). This prediction is supported in baboons, where juveniles spend more time than adults acquiring social information about a novel food (<a href=\"#bib17\">Carter et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, in Japanese macaques (<i>Macaca fuscata</i>), novel socially-transmitted behaviours were more likely to be adopted by juveniles (<a href=\"#bib44\">Huffman et al., 1996</a>). Sex differences in the social information use sequence are also likely due to, e.g., sex-specific costs of competition at resources (e.g. <a href=\"#bib3\">Arag\u00f3n, 2009</a>)."

However, individuals may preferentially acquire information from others besides those to whom they are associated as neighbours. For instance, individuals may be more attentive to those with whom they have strong affiliative bonds (<a href=\"#bib24\">Coussi-Korbel and Fragaszy, 1995</a>) or to lower ranking animals from whom they can scrounge resources (<a href=\"#bib50\">King et al., 2009</a>). The need to consider alternative networks in the identification of information diffusion paths is well illustrated by <a href=\"#bib9\">Boogert et al. (2014)</a>, who showed that the spread of solutions to a novel foraging task in captive starlings (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>) was better predicted by a network based on perching associations than foraging associations."

Individuals younger than 2 years did not have marks, were not individually recognisable and did not form part of the study. Dominance ranks were assessed through aggressive interactions, recorded <i>ad libitum</i>, using Matman 1.1.4 (Noldus Information Technology 2003). These data included all displacements, supplants, threats, chases and attacks that occurred for which we could identify both the actor and recipient. If more than one dominance behaviour occurred in one event, such as a threat followed by a chase, only one interaction was recorded. The dominance hierarchies were strongly linear (Landau\u2019s corrected linearity index: <i>h</i>\u2019<sub>J troop</sub> = 0.162, <i>h</i>\u2019<sub>L troop</sub> = 0.183, <i>N</i><sub>J</sub> = 618, <i>N</i><sub>L</sub> = 856, p&lt;0.001 in both cases). Dominance rank was expressed relatively (which controls for group size), using the formula 1-[(1-<i>r</i>)/(1-<i>n</i>)] where <i>r</i> is the individual\u2019s absolute rank and <i>n</i> is the group size, and ranges from 0 (lowest rank) to 1 (highest rank). Personality was indexed by boldness, estimated by presenting individuals with a novel food (2 cm<sup>2</sup> pieces of potato or sweet potato dyed blue) while foraging naturally alone and quantifying the time that the individuals spent investigating\u2014handling and smelling\u2014the novel food (for further details, see <a href=\"#bib15\">Carter et al., 2012b</a>). Individuals who investigated the novel food for longer were considered bolder. We tested individuals\u2019 boldness only once during the study period, but have previously found this test to be repeatable over three years (<a href=\"#bib15\">Carter et al., 2012b</a>) and correlated with subjective ratings of boldness (<a href=\"#bib14\">Carter et al., 2012a</a>). Age (in years) was estimated from a combination of known birth dates and dental patterns of tooth eruption and wear (see below). Unmarked immigrant males\u2019 ages were estimated at 9 years old when they appeared in the study troops, as this is the age most males were observed to transfer from our study groups."

The field site is on private land, and the baboons have minimal contact with people other than the research team. The troops forage entirely naturally, except during specific research events that involve troop capture or feeding experiments. These occur very rarely (five occasions over the past 10 years), are short in duration (2\u20134 weeks), and entail the provisioning of the entire troop with corn kernels at a single site at dawn (e.g., <a href=\"#bib49\">King et al. 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Carter et al., 2013</a>). Since 2009, individuals foraging alone have also been given the opportunity to sample a small, novel, food item (e.g., a slice of apple) at a random place and time, on average once per year, as a personality test (Carter et al., 2013)."

They are sequentially anaesthetised using tiletamine\u2013zolazepam and the entire troop is processed within a day, to be released together the following morning when fully awake. While the baboons are anaesthetised, age is estimated through dentition. Tooth eruption schedules are used to assign age up to molar eruption (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kahumbu and Eley, 1991</a>), while age beyond this point is estimated from molar wear. Validation of this approach using individuals captured on multiple occasions (N = 19 over periods of 1\u20135 years) to compare estimated versus known age differences between captures indicates these estimates are robust (the mean difference between the observed and estimated time periods does not differ from zero: one-sample t-test, p&gt;0.05; G.

We recorded subgroups (hereafter \u2018groups\u2019) within each troop according to three proximity-based definitions of group membership. To ensure that groups were sampled randomly and individuals were sampled evenly (and there was no bias against less social individuals), we quantified the groups associated with given \u2018focal\u2019 individuals chosen randomly from the troop membership. Because the troops can spread over 1 km<sup>2</sup> while foraging and finding particular individuals can be time consuming, the observer (MTT) searched for one of the first five individuals on the randomised list of baboons to optimise the number of independent groups sampled each day. Once a focal individual was found and its group membership quantified, that individual was removed from the list until all remaining individuals had been found and a new randomised list started. If a focal baboon had already been recorded in an already-sampled group (i.e., group membership had not changed), that individual was not sampled for an hour to ensure that the sampled groups constituted independent data. We are confident that each sampled group was independent and as such have not pooled data within arbitrary time periods (c.f. <a href=\"#bib13\">Carter et al., 2009</a>). We recorded group composition at each scan for each of our three proximity rules: (1) the identity of all individuals within a 10\u00a0m radius of the focal individual (10\u00a0m scans), (2) the identity of all individuals whose most peripheral member was within 5\u00a0m of another individual of the group (5\u00a0m chain scan) and (3) the nearest neighbour within 5\u00a0m of the focal individual (nearest neighbour scans) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Castles et al., 2014</a>).

Observers collected <i>ad libitum</i> data while performing other data collection tasks at the site that required them to search for every individual every day (to perform the daily census, to perform the scans [this study] and while doing focal follow observations [not this study]) and to estimate group spread and activity every 30\u2009min. Given that the observers were required to move constantly throughout the troop to monitor all individuals, our <i>ad libitum</i> data collection is not biased to more spatially central and/or obvious individuals and as such we have made no correction for individual baboon observability. New observers received training from experienced observers (who had worked with the baboons over at least two prior field seasons) until they could unambiguously and correctly identify dominance interactions (grooming was never ambiguous). No formal inter-observer reliability tests were done for <i>ad libitum</i> data, but we have successfully validated our training system for new observers collecting focal data in previous studies.

To avoid pseudoreplication in the collection of the interaction data, an independent grooming bout was recorded when the partner identities of the dyad changed or the dyad stopped grooming and moved to a different location. As such, we did not record reversals of dyads within bouts (i.e., if individual A groomed B, and B then groomed A without moving to a new location, B was not recorded as grooming A).

Weighted data, which we use in all our networks, indicate that the frequency of interactions between individuals is recorded, rather than a binary indicator of whether or not two individuals ever interacted. Directionality data indicate the degree to which interactions between individuals are reciprocal. Thus, undirected edges assume reciprocality, i.e. the relationships between dyads are equal and the association matrix is symmetrical along its diagonal, while directed edges assume non-reciprocality, e.g. A may groom B more than B grooms A and the association matrix is not symmetrical. From the records of group membership for the 10\u00a0m and 5\u00a0m chain rules, we created an undirected association matrix for each troop for each method using the simple ratio index (SRI): x/(x + y<sub>ab</sub> + y<sub>a</sub> + y<sub>b</sub>) where x is the number of times individuals A and B have been observed in the same group, y<sub>ab</sub> is the number of times individuals A and B have been observed in separate groups, y<sub>a</sub> is the number of times A has been observed without B and y<sub>b</sub> is the number of times B has been observed without A (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cairns and Schwager, 1987</a>). The nearest neighbour data, like the interaction data, are directional (A may have B as a nearest neighbour, but B\u2019s nearest neighbour may not be A). Thus, for these datasets, we created directed association matrices which included the frequency with which A was the 'actor' towards B. For nearest neighbour, these frequencies represented the count of times that A had B as its nearest neighbour; for grooming, the count of times A groomed B; for dominance, the count of times A was aggressive towards B. However, dyads in the directed networks may acquire social information from each other equally. As such, we also analysed all our directed networks as undirected networks (by summing the interactions given and received by a dyad so that the association matrix was symmetrical along the diagonal). In total, across the 5 proximity and interaction datasets, this resulted in 5 symmetric and 3 non-symmetric (directional) weighted association matrices for each troop, resulting in a total of 16 association matrices (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> for diagrams of the networks according to the 5 association rules)."

Degree strength (hereafter strength) sums the weighted edges each individual has with all other individuals in the network. Higher values indicate individuals who have more and/or stronger connections to others and are predicted to have greater access to information accordingly. Betweenness calculates the (weighted) number of shortest paths that travel \u2018through\u2019 a particular individual. Individuals with high betweenness connect different parts of networks and are therefore predicted to have greater access to information. We calculated both measures of centrality for the proximity, grooming and dominance networks using the igraph package (<a href=\"#bib29\">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</a>) in R (<a href=\"#bib68\">Team, 2011</a>)."

Two considerations were key to the design of the patch presentations: first, that the presentations were representative of naturalistic diffusions of information, such as about the location of a nest of eggs, and second, that the baboons did not learn to associate the observers with food. As such, one observer (AJC) created food patches by moving ahead of a foraging troop and scattering 52.9 \u00b1 5.3\u2009g of maize kernels over a 0.5\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> core area (with a little surrounding scatter enlarging this area to no more than 1\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>), in the direction of travel of the troop. To avoid the baboons observing the patch being created, the observer either (i) quickly scattered the kernels as she was walking or (ii) pretended to get something from her field backpack while scattering the kernels behind her bag. In all cases, the baboons did not see the kernels being placed. Furthermore, because the observer was present in the troops for many hours preceding and following these trials, the baboons did not associate the camera nor the waiting behaviour of the observer with the presence of the patches. Because the foraging paths of the baboons are unpredictable, and the baboons typically have to be within 2\u00a0m of the patch to see the corn kernels (median, range 0\u20138\u00a0m, N = 38 trials with recorded detection distances), there was variation in the spatial position of the individual who discovered the patch. In 28 of the 50 experiments (56%), it was an individual at the leading edge of the group that found the patch. In 11 experiments (22%), it was an individual at the side periphery and in a further 11 (22%) an individual in the middle-back of the troop. In total, 37 different baboons (J = 19, L = 18) discovered the patches (median = 1 time, min = 1, max = 5). Not every patch that was put out was found by a baboon, either because passing individuals failed to detect it or the troop changed their direction of travel (N &lt;\u00a010). In such cases, the patches were picked up by the observer after the baboons had left the area, and excluded from the analysis. In total, we performed 50 successful information diffusion experiments (25 per troop)."

The observer moved as required during the experiment to identify baboons. We recorded the identities of all individuals who (i) gazed at an individual in the patch, (ii) entered the patch and (iii) ate food from the patch (see <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). These data were used to quantify social information (i) acquisition, (ii) application and (iii) exploitation, respectively. Note that the prolonged gazes observed during information acquisition were clearly distinct from the brief glances used in the routine monitoring of conspecifics, with most animals approaching and halting at the patch to watch its occupants (e.g., <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). The experiment was conducted 25 times per troop. We subsequently counted the number of times each individual was recorded performing (i) \u2013 (iii) above, excluding those cases when they discovered the patch. On two occasions (in 50 experiments) an individual who acquired social information could not be identified before they left the vicinity of the patch, but otherwise we were able to identify all individuals who acquired, applied and exploited social information."

In the social transmission model, the rate at which na\u00efve individuals acquire information from informed individuals is proportional to the connection(s) they have to those individuals. In the asocial model, information is acquired independently of the social network. The parameter <i>s</i> estimates the social transmission relative to asocial transmission and ranges from 0, when there is no social transmission of information, to 1, when all information is transmitted socially (<a href=\"#bib42\">Hoppitt et al., 2010</a>). In natural situations, <i>s</i> \u2260 1 because at least one individual must acquire personal information for it to be socially transmitted. The social and asocial models are fitted to the observed order of diffusion data using maximum likelihood, and the model with the highest support, by comparison of Akaike Information Criteria corrected for small sample size (AIC<sub>C</sub>) (or a likelihood ratio test), indicates the most likely route of information diffusion."

Phenotypes were quantified according to social traits (dominance rank, network centrality), behavioural traits (personality), and demographic traits (age, sex). Two different measures of network centrality were used, namely the individual strength scores for the 10\u00a0m proximity and directed grooming networks, generating six phenotypic predictors in total. Individual betweenness scores were not used because they were strongly correlated with their corresponding strengths in almost all cases (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We chose to use the strengths and betweennesses from the 10\u00a0m proximity and directed grooming networks, because these were the best proximity and interaction network predictors of information diffusion respectively (see below).

All proximity networks and grooming networks had strong support for predicting the diffusion of information between group members in comparison to the asocial transmission model (\u0394AIC<sub>C</sub> for the social transmission model with the lowest AIC<sub>C</sub> versus the asocial model = 192.9). In all cases, the multiplicative models had a better fit than the additive models. The dominance networks, however, had little support in either case. The social network that best predicted the transmission of information was the 10\u00a0m network (AIC<sub>C</sub> = 3968.9), followed by the 5\u00a0m chain network (AIC<sub>C</sub> = 3993.4, \u0394AIC<sub>C</sub> = 24.5). These were followed by the undirected nearest neighbour network (\u0394AIC<sub>C</sub> = 82.1), which performed better than the directed neighbour network (\u0394AIC<sub>C</sub> = 114.4). All proximity networks were better at predicting diffusion than the grooming networks (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). For both grooming and dominance, there was minimal difference in the performance of the models between the directed and undirected networks (\u0394AIC<sub>C</sub> grooming = 3.6, dominance = 0.2). The social transmission parameter of the best multiplicative model (10\u00a0m proximity, <i>s</i> = 0.999) suggests that, following patch discovery, all subsequent discoveries were via social information. This was confirmed when comparing all possible combinations of individual-level variables in the 10\u00a0m model as all four of the best candidate models (\u0394AIC<sub>C</sub> = 0) were multiplicative and the best additive model was comparatively poor (\u0394AIC<sub>C</sub> = 9.85) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Model-averaged estimates of the individual-level variables calculated from the multiplicative OADA models indicated that rank (\u03b2 = 0.26), sex (\u03b2 = 0.15) and age (\u03b2 = -0.01) affected information diffusion, while boldness did not (\u03b2 = 0.00), such that more dominant, younger male baboons were more likely to learn asocially about patch locations (see <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a> for a list of the parameter estimates of the competing models)."

These results are consistent with several previous studies indicating the importance of spatiotemporal associations for information flow (e.g., great tits: <a href=\"#bib1\">Aplin et al., 2012</a>; three-spine sticklebacks: <a href=\"#bib4\">Atton et al., 2012</a>). While the most appropriate proximity network to capture information flow will vary depending on the type of information, the social forager, and the environment, our study emphasises the need to recognise that not all networks will be equally applicable. These findings build on the suggestions of previous authors (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lehmann and Ross, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Madden et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Castles et al., 2014</a>), and provide the first quantitative demonstration that multiple networks should be considered when studying information transmission. In the present analysis, the grooming networks also provided a good match to the pattern of information flow, suggesting that individuals may be more likely to monitor those with whom they share strong social bonds, irrespective of the symmetry of those bonds (the model results for the undirected and directed networks were very similar). However, the absence of an effect of grooming strength on information acquisition at the individual level (<a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>) suggests that such effects are relatively weak in comparison to those of spatial proximity. In contrast, the dominance networks were entirely unrelated to information flow. Since information flow required visual observation, this suggests that the monitoring of conspecifics is independent of dominance rank. A recent study of social attention in wild vervet monkeys reported a similar pattern (<a href=\"#bib65\">Renevey et al., 2013</a>). This may reflect the fact that dominants and subordinates monitor each other equally, albeit for different reasons: dominant animals seek to scrounge the food discoveries of others, while subordinates seek to avoid aggression."

In the first step, we found that information acquisition was independent of almost all phenotypic traits tested, i.e., age, sex, rank, personality, and social bonds (grooming strength). The only important trait was individual centrality in the 10\u00a0m proximity network. This suggests that visual information about the patch was inexpensive to collect, and limited only by an individual\u2019s spatial associations with other group members. Where the acquisition of social information is more costly, we might expect other phenotypic traits to become important. For instance, among juvenile chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>), sex differences in attentiveness are believed to explain why females spend more time observing, and are faster to learn, the challenging skill of \u2018termite fishing\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lonsdorf, 2005</a>)."

Both steps involved patch entry, but the latter also involved the successful capture of foraging benefits from the patch. The similarities and dissimilarities in phenotypic predictors between the two models are highly informative, not only with respect to understanding the different constraints that can operate along the information use sequence, but also in elucidating how information use mediates the acquisition of monopolisable resources. The latter is possible because our experimental design makes information exploitation synonymous with resource acquisition. Clearly, in many other cases, information exploitation will be unrelated to monopolisable resources but rather involve other types of knowledge, such as foraging skills, predation risk, and mate compatibility. In these instances, the phenotypic constraints on information application and exploitation may be quite different to those observed here."

Dominant animals were far more likely to successfully exploit social information, because they were able to monopolise food patches. Indeed, as information about the patch spread, increasingly dominant animals would become informed and enter the patch, supplanting lower ranked occupants and preventing others from entering subsequently until the patch was exhausted. This pattern is consistent with how dominant animals scrounge from others in this population (<a href=\"#bib50\">King et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Marshall et al., 2012</a>) and across social foragers generally (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barta and Giraldeau, 1998</a>). Surprisingly, however, dominance did not predict information application. The reason for this is that many subordinates also entered the patch, but only after the dominant animal had left (see <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Some of these animals were late arrivals, but a large number would be waiting (\u2018queuing\u2019) nearby for the dominant animal to leave. Since the patch was largely depleted when the dominant animal left, the subsequent patch entries by subordinates imply the application of outdated information, at a surprisingly large scale given over half of those entering the patch failed to exploit it. One possible explanation for such apparently maladaptive behaviour is that, while baboons are able to collect social information about patch location, they are unable to collect \u2018public\u2019 information about patch quality. A similar pattern has been observed in three-spined sticklebacks (<a href=\"#bib23\">Coolen et al., 2003</a>). However, other experimental work in this population indicates that baboons are able to collect such information (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lee, 2015</a>). A more likely explanation is that lower ranking individuals are aware that the patch is largely empty, but there is minimal cost in entering it and sifting through the sand in case any food items remain. Indeed, in a small number of cases, late arrivals did find a small number of kernels that had been overlooked."

                        "text": "Proximity strength remained a strong predictor for information application, as might be expected: individuals had to find the patch before they could enter it. However, because only a very small fraction of those who acquired and applied the information were able to benefit from it, the effect of proximity strength was lost in information exploitation. Grooming strength, however, was important for both information application and exploitation, possibly reflecting the role that social bonds play in tolerance at feeding sites, both in this baboon population (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sick et al., 2014</a>) and in primates more generally (<a href=\"#bib71\">Ventura et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tiddi et al., 2011</a>). Nevertheless, tolerance of direct co-feeding at the patch (patch sharing) was rare in this experiment: of the 293 patch entries observed in the 44 experiments for which these data could be extracted, only 14 (4.8%) resulted in co-feeding (where two or more individuals fed simultaneously from the patch). Moreover, in 4 of these cases (including one group of 3 co-feeders), there were vocal protests of intolerance from one or both parties (see <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a> for an example of a vocal protest during co-feeding). Thus toleration of co-feeding could be said to occur on only 9 occasions (3.1%). Instead, the tolerance observed in this experiment was primarily of close proximity of individuals to the patch, which allowed individuals to queue for and quickly enter the patch on a dominant\u2019s exit (see <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). There are thus two strategies for information application to occur, both of which may rely on social bonds: tolerated co-feeding and tolerated (close-proximity) queuing. A change in the dimensions of the patch to allow more foragers concurrently to occupy it, and thus a greater possibility of tolerated co-feeding, may show a greater effect of grooming strength on both social information exploitation and application."

As we control for rank in the analyses, this finding may reflect female reproductive constraints. Previous work on nine-spine sticklebacks (<i>Pungitius pungitius</i>) has indicated that female gravidity can influence the use of social information (<a href=\"#bib75\">Webster and Laland, 2010</a>). In our case, many of the observed females were either pregnant or lactating, and females in these states experience higher foraging demands (<a href=\"#bib67\">Silk, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barrett et al., 2006</a>), potentially making them less willing either to forego valuable foraging time to queue for patch entry (information application) or to spend excessive time searching for food once in the patch (information exploitation). Shy animals also showed lower rates of information exploitation, presumably because they were more nervous and therefore spent more time in the social monitoring of conspecifics (<a href=\"#bib33\">Edwards et al., 2013</a>). The observation that bolder animals were more likely to successfully exploit information is consistent with the finding that bolder animals are also more likely to demonstrate social learning in this population (<a href=\"#bib17\">Carter et al., 2014</a>). In comparison, <a href=\"#bib39\">Harcourt et al. (2010)</a> found no effect of boldness on social information use in three-spined sticklebacks. However, that study only went as far as the information application step of the information use sequence. We only found an effect of personality in the final information exploitation step."

The most likely explanation for this pattern is that dominant juveniles were more likely to be at the leading edge of a foraging group, and therefore the first to encounter the patches. Similarly, juvenile ring-tailed coatis (<i>Nasua nasua</i>) occupy positions at the leading edge of their foraging groups (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hirsch, 2011</a>). The multiplicative effect further suggests that the probability of younger dominant males occupying this spatial position increased the better connected they were in their social network. Notably, we found no effect of age on social information use. While this is not surprising at the information acquisition stage, where there were no phenotypic constraints other than network position, it is more surprising for information application and exploitation, especially since juveniles appear to show greater propensity for social learning than adults, both in baboons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Carter et al., 2014</a>) and more generally (e.g., meerkats, <i>Suricata suricatta</i>: <a href=\"#bib69\">Thornton and Malapert, 2009</a>). However, this propensity usually refers to social learning tasks involving novelty or complexity, reflecting the tendency for juveniles to be more curious and exploratory about their environment (<a href=\"#bib63\">Reader and Laland, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kendal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Benson-Amram and Holekamp, 2012</a>). In our case, the task simply involved entering and exploiting a patch of familiar food, and for such a task it might be expected that individuals of all ages would show equal abilities."

We provided individuals with the opportunity to acquire social information about the location of a highly preferred food source in a novel location. These novel patches were rapidly depleted and the social information quickly became outdated. Such short-lived, ephemeral information may be easy and cheap to acquire and, as we have found, more likely be transmitted through proximity rather than interaction networks. Whilst our results support previous findings that proximity social networks are important for the transmission of ephemeral and/or easy-to-acquire information among individuals in the wild (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aplin et al., 2012</a>), evidence from starlings suggests that more complex information diffuses through alternative networks. <a href=\"#bib9\">Boogert et al. (2014)</a> showed that information about novel foraging skills diffused through the perching rather than foraging social networks. Whilst it is challenging to determine the difficulty with which species acquire different types of information (<a href=\"#bib38\">Griffin et al., 2015</a>), research is needed to elucidate how the type of social information influences how quickly and through which networks it is transmitted. In the baboon system, we might similarly expect that social information that takes longer to acquire and/or process will transmit through different networks to those that transmit easy-to-acquire information."

Our study extends this work, revealing fundamental individual differences in the ability to use social information. Decomposing social information use into three constituent steps has further illuminated how these individual differences limit information use. The implications of such sequential phenotypic constraints are manifold. We conclude by considering two points. First, only a small number of individuals who acquire or apply social information may successfully exploit it. Similarly, <a href=\"#bib62\">Racine et al. (2012)</a> report that ring-billed gulls (<i>Larus delawarensis</i>) may acquire social information about the location of food resources but be unable to apply it because of parenting constraints. Second, where phenotypic traits are expressed in relation to conspecifics (e.g., dominance rank, network position), social information use will vary markedly between social environments. For instance, in a captive setting where competition is minimised (e.g. by testing individuals when isolated and not at risk of aggression: <a href=\"#bib11\">Call et al., 2005</a>) (c.f. <a href=\"#bib32\">Drea and Wallen, 1999</a>), subordinate animals may show a propensity for copying others (e.g. <a href=\"#bib46\">Kendal et al., 2015</a>), but in the wild, where subordinates are more vulnerable to aggression and where food resources are relatively more valuable, subordinates may rarely copy others. Together, these two points highlight a critical disjunction between an ability to acquire information and to capture its benefits. This disconnection is likely to have a fundamental impact on selection for social information use, such that even in social information-rich environments, only a small number of individuals of a particular phenotype may be selected to use it."

We thank the members of the Tsaobis Baboon Project 2014 Team 1 for collecting many of the interaction data and Neeltje Boogert for putting up with endless questions about interpretations of model parameters in OADA. We thank Alex Lee for being patient with the installation of MatMan and calculating the dominance hierarchy. We thank Will Hoppitt for answering our questions about model averaging in OADA. We thank Brianne Beisner, Brenda McCowan and an anonymous reviewer for constructive feedback on the manuscript.

It subsequently examines the role of several characteristics that govern the decision-making process at each of the three steps. The application of this novel approach is an important contribution that could have a significant, innovative influence on future research into decision-making and social transmission of information. The analysis presented in this paper goes beyond many other papers that use social network approaches by investigating multiple different social networks, which is critical to gaining a full understanding of social information transmission, because social groups are comprised of many different social networks. The data analysis techniques appear to be appropriate and state of the art. The article is well-organized and well-written. Although some of the results presented are not surprising and seem very intuitive (e.g., dominant animals were better able to exploit the information acquired about the food patches), other findings are quite valuable (e.g., boldness was relevant only at the stage of successful exploitation; proximity networks best predict social information transmission whereas dominance networks did not at all predict transmission). Our major concerns are primarily about details about the methods used to carry out the field experiments."

Indeed, in the videos, the maize seems to be placed in areas bare of vegetation where it is plausible to think that it could have been spotted from more than 1 m away. Also, the videos suggest that the maize may have been concentrated over a much smaller area than 1 square meter, making spotting easier, but co-feeding less likely to occur."

The prior test of boldness concerned handling of a novel food in isolation, i.e., boldness in a nonsocial context. The nonsocial test of taking a novel food item in isolation is probably assessing the animal's boldness with regard to exploration. Yet the application of boldness in the study likely had a social element to it, particularly when/if individuals attempted to co-feed with others in these small patches. Hence, the choice of the word 'shy' (Discussion, fifth paragraph) to mean the opposite of bold may not be accurate. What evidence is there that the two forms of boldness are equivalent? Correlated? Certainly humans differ in social vs. nonsocial manifestations of boldness. If they are not known to be equivalent, it would probably be more accurate to avoid the word 'boldness' and to say instead that baboons that show a high tendency to explore novel objects and surroundings also had a higher rate of successfully exploiting the experimental food patches."

The brief nature of their food patch experiments means that animals that acquired information about the location of the food patch (and perhaps even applied it, though unsuccessfully) did not have the opportunity to apply and exploit such information in the future. From an evolutionary perspective, however, social information can spread about more permanent food patches as well as ephemeral food patches, and there may be future opportunities for animals to return to the location of more permanent food patches and they may be able to apply the information acquired (about this new food patch) as well as successfully exploit it. This may even be a reason for low-ranking individuals to enter a depleted food patch (especially if visibility of patch details is somewhat limited without entering it) \u2013 to determine for themselves whether the food patch may be a permanent patch that they can return to at a later date."

Following the reviewers\u2019 suggestion, we now state explicitly in the Discussion how many instances of co-feeding there were (fifth paragraph) and summarise them for the reviewers here. We extracted instances of co-feeding from 44 experiments\u2019 videos (due to a technical problem with one of the video cameras, we could not download 6 of them from the camera we used and consequently could not back them up). In the 44 trials, there were 14 instances of co-feeding i.e. individuals eating &gt;1 kernel from the patch simultaneously (10 pairs, and 3 triplets); of these 14 co-feeding patch entries, 4 were not \u2018tolerance\u2019 per sei.e. two individuals fed at the patch but at least one of them vocally protested against the other. In total, there were 293 patch entries in this subset of 44 experiments; thus the vast majority of patch entries were not tolerated co-feeding. The tolerance that we observed was primarily for individuals to be allowed in close proximity to an occupier of a patch without being threatened or chased away. Tolerated queuing could thus be defined as a patch occupier allowing the proximity of an individual within, for example, 10 m of the patch for &gt;10s. Unfortunately, as we did not set out to quantify this behaviour in these experiments, we cannot retrospectively accurately estimate instances of tolerated queuing \u2013 as our goal was to quantify the identities of individuals acquiring, applying and exploiting information, we did not film or keep an accurate dictated record of all those individuals who might be waiting around the patch, their distances from the patch, and their turnover. In our future experiments, we could endeavour to collect these data with the use of a second observer. As suggested by the reviewers, we discuss these two strategies in the text, suggest a change in the experimental design that could test this idea, and provide another video of \u201ctolerated queuing\u201d to illustrate this strategy in individuals of different ranks (as opposed to the infants queuing for the patch of the dominant male in <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) (Discussion, fifth paragraph)."

Regarding the first issue, we have shown convergent validity for this trait using a multimethod approach (Carter et al. 2012), which suggests that (i) this trait is more general than a \u201ctendency to explore novel objects\u201d and (ii) this trait is not exploration, though there may be overlap with such a trait (Carter et al. 2013). As such, we feel it is better to retain the term \u2018boldness\u2019. In addition, this approach is consistent with the terminology we have established in our past publications (while using the term \u201cexploration\u201d now would introduce confusion). Regarding the second issue, we have three lines of evidence that novel food boldness also relates to the social environment: novel food boldness predicts social learning (Carter et al. 2014), bolder individuals tend to associate with other bolder individuals (Carter et al. 2015), and novel food boldness correlates with cross-context observer assessment scores of boldness (Carter et al. 2012). Since one of the goals of personality research is to understand such overlaps (e.g. behavioural syndromes, Sih et al. 2004), we feel the current presentation is in-line with these approaches."

We have now elaborated to clarify (Materials and Methods, subsection \u201cInteraction networks\u201d, first paragraph). No, unfortunately it is impossible to perform all-occurrences sampling of interactions, nor is it possible to record how much time observers spend in proximity to particular baboons to estimate sampling rates. However, as we explain in the amended manuscript, we believe that our sampling method was not biased because all observers were required to move throughout the troops and to monitor all group members throughout the day as part of their other data collection duties, and they thus regularly sampled the entire troop. Like the referees, we were also surprised by the range in the observations of interactions; however, on inspection of these, they made biological sense and we were satisfied they were representative: frequent groomers were females in consortship with males (and often the same males over months); infrequent groomers were juvenile males; frequent antagonists were males in consortship with females; infrequent antagonists were low ranking individuals. The patterns in the ad lib interactions data are also verified by the behavioural states observed during the focal individual proximity scans, i.e., some individuals were frequent groomers, while others were never observed grooming (across 94 individuals, the percentage of observations taken during grooming ranged from 0 to 35%, with 14 individuals never recorded grooming); moreover, females in consortship groomed more than all other individuals (Welch two-sample t-test: t = -3.13, df = 42.05, p = 0.003) while juvenile males groomed less than others (Welch two-sample t-test: t = 6.35, df = 91.97, p &lt; 0.001). Finally, we now also specify how we sampled to avoid pseudoreplication (in the second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection)."

While we perform concurrent observations for interobserver reliability tests for data collected using focal observations, we do not perform such tests for the ad libitum data. While grooming is never ambiguous, some dominance interactions can be more subtle and difficult to identify correctly (such as during recruitment for coalition formation where it may not be clear which individual is being threatened by whom). New observers to the site thus receive intensive training at the beginning of the field season, and are tested by experienced observers until they consistently identify dominance interactions correctly. This usually takes two weeks. Observers are advised to collect dominance data only when they are sure of the interaction. We have added text to this effect to the manuscript (subsection \u201cInteraction networks\u201d, first paragraph)."

This is our current research focus! That is, we are now investigating whether particular (social and behavioural) phenotypes are more or less likely to generate information and, if so, whether individuals can pay attention to such information generators strategically to maximise social information acquisition. Whilst we have included information about the numbers of individuals who found a patch to demonstrate the diversity of patch discoverers (Materials and methods, subsection \u201cInformation diffusion experiments\u201d, first paragraph), we are aware that this is not information about their phenotypes. Because this is a research topic for which we have been collecting data we do have some preliminary analyses to answer the reviewers\u2019 queries. These suggest that older individuals are more likely to be on the periphery of the troop and higher ranking individuals tend to be at the front, though this latter relationship is not statistically significant. Perhaps surprisingly, the proportion of time individuals are found on the periphery or front of the troop does not predict whether or not they will find a patch, though again we stress that these analyses are preliminary. We have not yet analysed whether network and spatial positions are correlated. However, we would prefer not to present these results in the current manuscript. Our reasons for this are two-fold: (1) the analyses answer a different research question tangential to the main research questions, and (2) we are currently collecting a more robust dataset (pooled over 3 years) to answer this question and do not wish to present these limited analyses here."

From an evolutionary perspective, however, social information can spread about more permanent food patches as well as ephemeral food patches, and there may be future opportunities for animals to return to the location of more permanent food patches and they may be able to apply the information acquired (about this new food patch) as well as successfully exploit it.
