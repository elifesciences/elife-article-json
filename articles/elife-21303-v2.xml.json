The expression of <i>Paired-homeobox 6 (PAX6)</i> is regulated by multiple cis-DNA elements including the intronic \u03b1-enhancer, which is active in GABAergic amacrine cell subsets. Here, we report that the transforming growth factor \u00df1-induced transcript 1 protein (Tgfb1i1) interacts with the LIM domain transcription factors Lhx3 and Isl1 to inhibit the \u03b1-enhancer in the post-natal mouse retina. <i>Tgfb1i1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice show elevated \u03b1-enhancer activity leading to overproduction of Pax6\u0394PD isoform that supports the GABAergic amacrine cell fate maintenance. Consequently, the <i>Tgfb1i1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse retinas show a sustained light response, which becomes more transient in mice with the auto-stimulation-defective <i>Pax6<sup>\u0394PBS/\u0394PBS</sup></i> mutation. Together, we show the antagonistic regulation of the \u03b1-enhancer activity by Pax6 and the LIM protein complex is necessary for the establishment of an inner retinal circuitry, which controls visual adaptation."

The expression of <i>Paired-homeobox 6 (PAX6)</i> is regulated by multiple cis-DNA elements including the intronic \u03b1-enhancer, which is active in GABAergic amacrine cell subsets. Here, we report that the transforming growth factor \u00df1-induced transcript 1 protein (Tgfb1i1) interacts with the LIM domain transcription factors Lhx3 and Isl1 to inhibit the \u03b1-enhancer in the post-natal mouse retina. <i>Tgfb1i1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice show elevated \u03b1-enhancer activity leading to overproduction of Pax6\u0394PD isoform that supports the GABAergic amacrine cell fate maintenance. Consequently, the <i>Tgfb1i1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse retinas show a sustained light response, which becomes more transient in mice with the auto-stimulation-defective <i>Pax6<sup>\u0394PBS/\u0394PBS</sup></i> mutation. Together, we show the antagonistic regulation of the \u03b1-enhancer activity by Pax6 and the LIM protein complex is necessary for the establishment of an inner retinal circuitry, which controls visual adaptation."

Several other transcription factors control the production of Pax6 by binding to a section of DNA known as the \u201c\u03b1-enhancer\u201d.

In experiments performed in mice, the loss of Tgfb1i1 led to increased production of this form of Pax6, which resulted in the retina containing more of a certain type of amacrine cell that produce a molecule called GABA. Mice lacking Tgfb1i1 show a stronger response to light and are therefore comparable to people who are too sensitive to light. On the other hand, mice with a missing a section of the \u03b1-enhancer DNA have fewer amacrine cells releasing GABA and become less sensitive to light and are comparable to people who have difficulty detecting weaker light signals."

After light detection by rod and cone photoreceptors, the first step in visual processing occurs in bipolar cells that are either stimulated or inhibited by light-absorbed photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Masland, 2012</a>). The activities of bipolar cells are then tuned by horizontal cells while they receive visual input from the photoreceptors and by amacrine cells while they deliver the signals to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hoon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Masland, 2012</a>). The amacrine cells do not simply convey the signals from bipolar cells, but they also invert the signals by releasing inhibitory neurotransmitters such as <b>\u03b3</b>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine. Therefore, even subtle changes in the composition and connectivity of amacrine cell subsets might alter the output of the retina, modifying the visual information sent to the brain."

Thus, the alterations of transcription factors that specify retinal neuron subtypes should modify visual output of mature retina. Those transcription factors include Pax6 in amacrine cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marquardt et al., 2001</a>), Vsx2 in bipolar cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 1994</a>), Otx2 in bipolar cells and photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koike et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nishida et al., 2003</a>), and Lhx2 and Sox2 in M\u00fcller glia and certain amacrine subtypes (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Melo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gordon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lin et al., 2009</a>).

The \u2018\u03b1-enhancer\u2019, located within intron 4 of the <i>Pax6</i> gene, is active in the retina from embryo to adult (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kammandel et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Marquardt et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Plaza et al., 1995</a>). This retina-specific enhancer activity sustains in RPCs in the peripheral retina of the embryos and regulates neuronal differentiation in a context-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marquardt et al., 2001</a>). In the mature eye, the \u03b1-enhancer is active in cells of the ciliary body and amacrine cells of the retina (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marquardt et al., 2001</a>)."

We found Lhx2, but not Isl1, shows specific binding to the DF4 sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Isl1 instead binds DF3, which contains the predicted Isl1 binding sequence 5\u2019-CATTAG-3\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Leonard et al., 1992</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>).

This inhibition of the \u03b1-enhancer is even more significant when Tgfb1i1 is co-expressed with both Lhx3 and Isl1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). We hypothesized that multiple LIM domains of Tgfb1i1 allow it to form a multi-protein complex that blocks \u03b1-enhancer-dependent gene expression. To assess this, we co-expressed these LIM domain transcription factors with Lmo4 (LIM-domain-only 4), which prevents Isl1 and Lhx3 from interacting with one another or with other LIM domain-containing proteins (<a href=\"#bib55\">Thaler et al., 2002</a>). Lmo4 alone caused a dose-dependent increase in \u03b1-enhancer activity and potentiated Pax6-induced activation of the \u03b1-enhancer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In the presence of Lmo4, Lhx3 and Isl1 cannot inhibit the \u03b1-enhancer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Thus, Pax6 binding to the PBS may hinder the binding of Isl1-Tgfb1i1-Lhx3 complex to the DF3 and DF4 sequences, and vice versa. Using ChIP analyses in the cultured cells, we found Isl1, Lhx3, and Tgfb1i1 reduce the binding of Pax6 to the \u03b1-enhancer when all three are co-expressed but not when expressed individually (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, three right graphs). Conversely, Pax6 expression interferes with the access of Tgfb1i1 to the \u03b1-enhancer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, rightmost graph). Pax6 does not affect Lhx3 binding to the \u03b1-enhancer, but it promotes Isl1 binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>, two center graphs). Together, these molecular interaction results suggest two different transcription factor complexes occupying the \u03b1-enhancer region. The Isl1-Pax6 complex binds to the DF3 and PBS and activates the \u03b1-enhancer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>, top), whereas the Isl1-Tgfb1i1-Lhx3 complex binds to DF3 and DF4 to cover the area between those two sequences and inhibit the access of Pax6 to DF3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>, bottom)."

About 54% of EGFP-positive INL cells in P14 mouse retinas, which were electroporated with the pCAGIG-Pax6\u0394PD DNA at P0, are identified as Syntaxin-positive amacrine cells, whereas only 26% of EGFP-positive INL cells are amacrine cells in the retinas electroporated with control pCAGIG DNA (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> [top row], D). This is also contrary to the results of pCAGIG-Pax6-electroporated mouse retinas, in which about 85% of EGFP-positive INL cells are identified as amacrine cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> [top row, middle], D). Moreover, by showing insignificantly different marker positivity with EGFP;Syntaxin double-positive INL cells (54% \u00b1 7.56%(Syntaxin) vs. 46% \u00b1 7.33%(Gad67)), majority of EGFP-positive amacrine cells in the pCAGIG-Pax6\u0394PD-electroporated retinas are predicted as GABAergic amacrine cells, which are approximately half of the EGFP;Syntaxin double-positive amacrine cell population in pCAGIG-Pax6-electroporated mouse retinas (85% \u00b1 7.2%(Syntaxin) vs. 44% \u00b1 9.17%(Gad67)) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> [second row], D). The populations of EGFP-positive cholinergic and glycinergic amacrine cells in pCAGIG-Pax6\u0394PD-electroporated mouse retinas are not greatly different from those in pCAGIG-electroporated mouse retinas, but are lower than those in pCAGIG-Pax6-electroporated mouse retinas (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> [bottom two rows], D).

To test this hypothesis, we presented the mice with two different types of visual stimuli. First, we trained dark-adapted mice to associate a water reward with a flashing light stimulus. Then, we counted correct water-licking events in response to various intensities of flash light (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). <i>Tgfb1i1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mice not only learn this task faster than WT mice (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), but they also show more sensitive detection of the light stimuli (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

Especially, the \u2018LIM code\u2019 mixes and matches LIM domain-containing transcription factors to direct tissue- and cell-specific gene expression (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gill, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002</a>). Lhx3, for example, specifies motor neuron cell fate in the spinal cord by forming a hetero-hexameric complex with Isl1 and nuclear LIM interactor (NLI) for the binding to the promoter of the <i>Mnx1/Hb9</i> gene, whereas it specifies V2 interneuron cell fate by forming a hetero-tetrameric complex with NLI at the promoter of the <i>Vsx2/Chx10</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib55\">Thaler et al., 2002</a>). Given that the various LIM homeodomain transcription factors, including Lhx2, Lhx3, Lhx4, and Lhx9, share a consensus target sequence (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gehring et al., 1994</a>), we speculate Isl1 partners with different LIM homeodomain transcription factors in a cell-context-dependent manner. In contrast to its relationship with Lhx3, Isl1 cooperates with Lhx2 to activate the \u03b1-enhancer in cultured cell lines (data not shown). However, this is unlikely to occur in vivo, because Lhx2 and Isl1 are expressed mutually exclusively in RPCs (Lhx2) and post-mitotic RGCs (Isl1) of the embryonic mouse retina, in GABAergic (Lhx2) and cholinergic amacrine cells (Isl1) in the mature retina, as well as in M\u00fcller glia (Lhx2) and ON bipolar cells (Isl1) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balasubramanian et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Elshatory et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gordon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pan et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, <i>Lhx2<sup>flox/flox</sup>;P6\u03b1-Cre</i> retinas, which lack Lhx2 expression in the Cre-active lineages (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gordon et al., 2013</a>), show no change in the number of <i>Pax6</i> \u03b1-enhancer-active cells (data not shown).

The effects of Tgfb1i1 on the \u03b1-enhancer could be achieved by blocking Pax6\u2019s access the PBS sequence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>). Alternatively, Tgfb1i1 may also recruit transcriptional co-repressors, such as NCoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Heitzer and DeFranco, 2006</a>), to the <i>Pax6</i> \u03b1-enhancer. These negative effects of Tgfb1i1 on the <i>Pax6</i> \u03b1-enhancer can be antagonized by Lmo4, which is persistently co-expressed with Pax6 in the retina and interferes with the interactions between Tgfb1i1 and Lhx3 and/or Isl1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duquette et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3D</a>). Retinas lacking <i>Lmo4</i> have fewer GABAergic amacrine cells than controls (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duquette et al., 2010</a>), which suggests Lmo4 may positively affect <i>Pax6</i> \u03b1-enhancer-dependent GABAergic amacrine cell fate determination by inhibiting the formation of the LIM complex. However, the antagonistic regulation of the LIM complex by Tgfb1i1 and Lmo4 could not be applied to OFF bipolar cell fate determination, since OFF bipolar cell numbers are decreased commonly in <i>Tgfb1i1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> and Lmo4-cko mouse retinas. Our results suggest that Tgfb1i1 and Lmo4 might involve in the development of different OFF bipolar cell subsets.

Pax6\u0394PD does not affect Pax6 target gene expression via the conserved PBS (data not shown). Instead, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mikkola et al., 2001</a>), Pax6\u0394PD may potentiate the expression of Pax6 target genes by interacting with full-length Pax6. This facilitation of Pax6-induced gene transcription by Pax6\u0394PD may also occur with the <i>Pax6</i> \u03b1-enhancer, resulting in a feed-forward activation of the \u03b1-enhancer. Alternatively, it may bind another promoter element containing the Pax6 homeodomain target DNA sequence (TAATT(/C)NA(/C)ATTA). Therefore, future studies will be needed to identify the targets of Pax6\u0394PD in RPCs and post-mitotic retinal neurons.

Acting downstream of rod bipolar cells that deliver visual signals from rod photoreceptors, A17 GABAergic amacrine cells provide a direct feedback inhibition to the rod bipolar cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2010</a>). In parallel, an\u00a0unidentified subset of GABAergic amacrine cells is also proposed to inhibit rod bipolar cells at the\u00a0downstream of ON-cone bipolar cells, which can be activated by AII amacrine cells in the rod pathway as well as by daylight (<a href=\"#bib10\">Demb and Singer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Eggers et al., 2013</a>). GABAergic inhibition to the rod bipolar cells could be reduced in <i>Tgfb1i1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mouse retinas, leading to sustained ON responses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Conversely, the ON pathway in <i>Pax6<sup>\u0394PBS/\u0394PBS</sup></i> mouse retinas is activated more transiently and is also more readily re-activated by subsequent visual stimuli (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Therefore, the P6\u03b1 amacrine cells might attenuate those GABAergic inhibitions to rod bipolar cells and prevent premature inactivation of rod pathway. However, future studies should identify molecular and electrophysiological identities of the P6\u03b1 amacrine cells and their pre- and post-synaptic partners to fully understand this visual adaptive circuits in the inner retina."

The in vitro transcribed sgRNAs (50 ng/ml) were injected into C57BL6/J mouse embryos (2 cell-stage) together with Cas9 mRNA (100 ng/\u03bcl; purchased from Toolgen Inc.,\u00a0South\u00a0Korea). Then, these embryos were injected into the inner cell mass of ICR embryos. Four resulting F1 chimeric male mice were crossed to C57BL6/J female mice to obtain an F2 generation with the potential to carry deletions in the PBS. Then, tail DNA from each F2 mouse (n = 51) was prepared and used as a template for the PCR-amplification of the <i>Pax6</i> \u03b1-enhancer sequence. Each resulting PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector for sequencing. Four F2 mice carry different heterozygous deletions in the PBS sequence were obtained. Before breeding with littermate <i>Pax6<sup>+/\u0394PBS</sup></i> female mice, <i>Pax6<sup>+/\u0394PBS</sup></i> male mice were crossed with C57BL6/J females for more than six generations to dilute any potentially OFF target mutations. All experiments using mice were performed according to the regulations of the KAIST-IACUC (KA2012-38)."

All mice used for this task were water-deprived for 1 day before beginning the training protocol. For the visual stimulus, we presented a full-field flashing light five times (10 Hz for 500 ms) through a gamma-corrected LCD monitor placed 10 cm from the left eye. Each stimulus trial began with a visual stimulus (500 ms in duration) and ended with a 2 s inter-trial period. Non-stimulus trials were randomly interleaved with stimulus trials using custom code (Presentation). We detected each lick through a custom-made lickport (4.0 mm ID) using a transistor-based lickometer system. Licks detected during the final 2 s of stimulus trials (i.e., in the response window) were rewarded with 4 \u00b5l of water (on). We delivered water rewards by gravity into the lickport under the control of a solenoid valve. Licks detected during the response window of non-stimulus trials were punished with a mild air puff (300 ms) and a longer inter-trial interval (8 s, timeout) (off). We delivered compressed air puff punishments (10 psi) through a plastic tip (1.0 mm ID) located 2 cm from the face and controlled by a solenoid valve. Mice whose spontaneous lick rate during non-stimulus trials fell below 0.4 were advanced to the next phase. In the next phase, we measured lick rates in response to nine different intensities of visual stimuli presented randomly with equal probability."

Training proceeded in two steps: conditioning and discrimination. For conditioning (2\u20138 days), we trained each mouse to lick in response to continuous light. Each trial began with a continuous light (go stimulus, 2 s duration) and ended with an inter-trial period of 2 s. Licks detected in the final 2 s of the trial (i.e., in the response window) were rewarded with 10 \u00b5l of water for 2 s. During the conditioning phase, water rewards were still given after continuous light even if the animal failed to lick during the response window. Mice exceeding 300 licks within 1 hr were advanced to the discrimination phase. For discrimination (15 days), we trained mice to lick only when continuous light (2 s) was presented (go trial) and not to lick when a drifting horizontal grate stimulus (1 s) was presented after a continuous light stimulus (1 s) (no-go trial). All visual stimuli used for training were fixed at 57 Lux. We never presented the same type of stimulus more than three consecutive times. Licks within the response window of go trials were rewarded with water (4 \u00b5l) for 2 s, and licks within the response window of no-go trials were punished with mild air puffs (300 ms) and a longer inter-trial interval (8 s, timeout). Mice were neither rewarded nor punished for misses (i.e., no lick in a go trial) or correct rejections (i.e., no lick in a no-go trial). Training ended when the mouse stopped licking for 10 consecutive go trials."

This manuscript reports the identification of a new LIM domain protein Tgfb1i1 that forms a LIM protein complex with Lhx3 and Isl1 to inhibit the activity of the Pax6 \u03b1-enhancer and its auto-binding by Pax6. Site-directed mutagenesis of the \u03b1-enhancer, which transcribes the Pax6 isoform Pax6\u2206PD, leads to loss of GABAergic amacrine cells, whereas both Pax6\u2206PD overexpression and Tgfb1i1 inactivation, which augments the \u03b1-enhancer activity and overproduces Pax6\u2206PD, results in increased GABAergic amacrine cells in mice. Tgfb1i1 knockout and the \u03b1-enhancer mutant mice also display opposite physiological properties: sustained light responses versus more transient ones. This work is a comprehensive in-depth study of the \u03b1-enhancer machinery which has revealed a novel function of the little known Pax6\u2206PD isoform in the specification of a physiological amacrine cell subtype, thus representing a major extension of previous studies on an essential transcriptional regulator of retinal development."

Pax6 plays a critic role in eye development from the establishment of eye field to the formation of retina and lens. In the retina, Pax6 is expressed throughout retinogenesis and its expression remains in the amacrine and ganglion cells post-development. Prior work in the field has shown that multiple Pax6 transcripts arise from alternative transcriptional initiation and/or alternative splicing. In addition, studies have identified Pax6 \u03b1-enhancer, a regulatory region in the intron of Pax6 gene, which contains multiple binding sites for transcription factors including the auto-stimulatory PAX6 binding sites. Nevertheless, how the expression of different Pax6 transcripts is regulated and what are the roles of Pax6 in amacrine subtypes remains unclear."

Here, Kim et al. report that \u03b1-enhancer is specifically activated in GABAergic amacrine cells. By using a proteomic screen, ChIP and in vitro assays, they show that LHX3 and TGFB1I1 interact, bind to the \u03b1-enhancer, and inhibit \u03b1-enhancer activity in vitro. Tgfb1i1-null retinas display higher \u03b1-enhancer activity and generate more GABAergic amacrine cells and fewer OFF bipolar cells. In contrast, removal of Pax6 auto-stimulatory sequences in the \u03b1-enhancer in vivo leads to a reduction in Pax6\u0394PD and in fewer GABAergic amacrine cells but more OFF bipolar cells. Furthermore, these mutant mice exhibit altered visual acuity and adaptation. Overall, this is a well-performed study and results presented in the paper make a case for the model in which Lhx3 and Tgfb1i1 negatively regulate \u03b1-enhancer and the development of GABAergic amacrine cells.

There is insufficient data in vivo to support it. The main problem is that GABAergic amacrine cells are mostly born during embryogenesis and peak at E14 (Voinescu et al., 2009, J. Comp. Neurol.). Giving the late-onset of Lhx3 expression at P7 (Elshatory et al., 2007, J. Neurosci.), it is unlikely that Lhx3 regulates the development of GABAergic amacrine cells by regulating \u03b1-enhancer. The binding of LHX3 to \u03b1-enhancer in vivo (ChIP-PCR results) and LHX3-TGFB1I1 interaction could occur in the bipolar cells, which may or may not be of any functional significance. Experiments such as knocking out or knocking down Lhx3 during amacrine development are desirable to address the role of Lhx3 directly. Also, the authors did a nice CRISPR/Cas9 experiment to demonstrate the necessity of PBS, has a similar experiment done on the LHX3 binding site in DF4?"

If so, what is the subtype(s) and how is related to the change in visual function seen in Tgfb1i1-nulls? Similarly, is the increase of amacrine cells specific to the INL or GCL or both?

They find that LIM proteins form a complex (consisting of Isl1, Lhx3, and Tgfb1i1) that inhibits transcription from this enhancer and thereby inhibits amacrine cell fate. The mechanism appears to involve preventing Pax6 itself from binding the \u03b1 enhancer. Analysis of Tgfb1i1 and Pax6 binding site (deltaPBS) mutant mice suggest that the two proteins may regulate a cell fate choice between GABAergic amacrine and OFF bipolar cell. Behavior and physiology studies demonstrate that amacrine cell number influences sensitivity to light flashes, both in the context of low-threshold detection and light adaptation. I very much like the authors' approach of linking developmental mechanisms to visual function. The molecular studies are thorough and potentially very interesting.

However, I'm unclear on the cellular context in which this is supposed to act. All of these proteins are expressed by postmitotic neurons, mainly in the first postnatal week. So the complex can only exist in neurons. But cell fate decisions are typically made at the progenitor stage, upon cell cycle exit. And GABAergic amacrine cells are typically born before P0 (Cherry et al., 2009, PNAS; Voinescu et al., 2009, J. Comp. Neurol.). So how does the cell fate switch actually work? Is there a transdifferentiation of bipolar cells into amacrines in Tgfb1i1 mutants? Or does the window of GABAergic amacrine cell genesis extend longer, such that they keep getting born when it's supposed to be time for OFF bipolar genesis? Or could the authors have missed the existence of the complex in progenitors? Without a plausible cellular mechanism I remain somewhat skeptical of the notion that this is a simple cell fate switch."

Full-length Pax6 also increases GABA amacrine cell fate, and suppresses Vsx1 bipolar cell fate. So these features are not selective to the deltaPD version of Pax6.

All of the MEA and behavior experiments were done in a light regime where the test stimulus was a brief light stimulus presented in the dark. We don't know what would happen with the inverse paradigm. Even if we did, it is still pretty speculative to get into circuit mechanisms here. The two mutant mice manipulate amacrine cell number in opposite directions.

Here, we show Tgfb1i1 inhibits GABAergic amacrine cell fate, although it also supports OFF bipolar cell fate like <i>Lmo4</i>. The supportive role of <i>Lmo4</i> in the development of both retinal subtypes was proposed based on the reduced numbers of Bhlhb5-positive cells in <i>Lmo4</i>-cko mouse retinas (Duquette et al., 2010). Interestingly, the numbers of Bhlhb5-positive type-2 OFF bipolar cell subsets are not significantly changed in Tgfb1i1-KO and Pax6(\u0394PBS/\u0394PBS) mouse retinas in comparison to WT littermates, whereas Vsx1-positive OFF bipolar cell numbers were significantly altered in those mutant retinas (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6F</a>). The results are also contrary to the changes of Bhlhb5-positive GABAergic amacrine cell subsets, which are increased in Tgfb1i1-ko retinas but are decreased in Pax6(\u0394PBS/\u0394PBS) retinas. The results therefore suggest that Tgfb1i1 and <i>Lmo4</i> might be involved in the development of different OFF bipolar cell subsets, thus the loss of Tgfb1i1 causes the defects in the development of OFF bipolar cell subsets different from those affected in <i>Lmo4</i>-cko mice.To avoid the confusion that can be imposed by these complicated relationships (and also to follow the suggestion of other reviewer), we removed the diagram from the revised paper but still wrote in the text (subsection \u201cTgfb1i1<sup>-/-</sup> retinas have excessive Pax6 \u03b1-enhancer-active GABAergic amacrine cells\u201d, third paragraph)."

However, I'm unclear on the cellular context in which this is supposed to act. All of these proteins are expressed by postmitotic neurons, mainly in the first postnatal week. So the complex can only exist in neurons. But cell fate decisions are typically made at the progenitor stage, upon cell cycle exit. And GABAergic amacrine cells are typically born before P0 (Cherry et al., 2009, PNAS; Voinescu et al., 2009, J. Comp. Neurol.). So how does the cell fate switch actually work? Is there a transdifferentiation of bipolar cells into amacrines in Tgfb1i1 mutants? Or does the window of GABAergic amacrine cell genesis extend longer, such that they keep getting born when it's supposed to be time for OFF bipolar genesis? Or could the authors have missed the existence of the complex in progenitors?

Combining these, we hypothesize that the LIM complex likely contributes to specifying OFF bipolar cell fate, which might be achieved by overcoming default GABAergic amacrine cell fate in the post-natal mouse retina, via the inhibition of Pax6 \u03b1-enhancer-driven Pax6-\u0394PD expression."
