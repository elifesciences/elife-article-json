We use high-resolution X-ray crystallography and computational methods to delineate the mechanism of the homotrimeric RND-type proton/drug antiporter AcrB, the active component of the major efflux system AcrAB-TolC in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and one most complex and intriguing membrane transporters known to date. Analysis of wildtype AcrB and four functionally-inactive variants reveals an unprecedented mechanism that involves two remote alternating-access conformational cycles within each protomer, namely one for protons in the transmembrane region and another for drugs in the periplasmic domain, 50 \u00c5 apart. Each of these cycles entails two distinct types of collective motions of two structural repeats, coupled by flanking \u03b1-helices that project from the membrane. Moreover, we rationalize how the cross-talk among protomers across the trimerization interface might lead to a more kinetically efficient efflux system."

We use high-resolution X-ray crystallography and computational methods to delineate the mechanism of the homotrimeric RND-type proton/drug antiporter AcrB, the active component of the major efflux system AcrAB-TolC in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and one most complex and intriguing membrane transporters known to date. Analysis of wildtype AcrB and four functionally-inactive variants reveals an unprecedented mechanism that involves two remote alternating-access conformational cycles within each protomer, namely one for protons in the transmembrane region and another for drugs in the periplasmic domain, 50 \u00c5 apart. Each of these cycles entails two distinct types of collective motions of two structural repeats, coupled by flanking \u03b1-helices that project from the membrane. Moreover, we rationalize how the cross-talk among protomers across the trimerization interface might lead to a more kinetically efficient efflux system."

Proton transport also proceeds according to an alternating-access mechanism\u2014and, although the transmembrane and periplasmic domains are far apart, their movements are tightly linked. Thus, because proton uptake releases energy, the transmembrane domain effectively powers the periplasmic domain to expel drugs and other molecules.

Its biological function is to capture cytotoxic compounds from either the periplasmic space or the inner membrane, and to expel them across the outer membrane, into the extracellular medium. This tripartite system is arguably one of the most complex and intriguing secondary transporters known to date, from both structural and mechanistic standpoints. The AcrAB-TolC system and its homologues are also of considerable biomedical interest, as they confer multidrug resistance to important pathogenic bacteria involved in human disease (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nikaido and Pag\u00e8s, 2012</a>)."

In each protomer, the transmembrane (TM) domain consists of 12 \u03b1-helices (TM1\u2013TM12), mostly interconnected by short unstructured loops as is common. In contrast to other secondary transporters, however, AcrB also features two large periplasmic insertions, between TM1 and TM2, and between TM7 and TM8, which account for approximately 60% of the 1049 amino acids in each protomer. These insertions are highly structured domains that project 70 \u00c5 away from the membrane, and form extensive interfaces among protomers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The TM domains barely contribute to the trimer interface, in further contrast to typical homomeric transporters. The more distal region of the periplasmic domain features a central funnel-shaped cavity that channels the substrate towards TolC, the outer-membrane channel component (140 \u00c5 in length) of this transport system (<a href=\"#bib16\">Koronakis et al., 2000</a>).

                        "text": "The intricate and unusual topology of AcrB and its trimerization state were confirmed by subsequent higher-resolution X-ray structures obtained from crystals grown in different space groups, several of which include bound substrates (<a href=\"#bib26\">Murakami et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Seeger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sennhauser et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nakashima et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Eicher et al., 2012</a>). These structures, however, also revealed that upon substrate loading AcrB becomes asymmetric, that is, each protomer in the trimer adopts one of three distinct conformational states, designated as \u2018loose\u2019 (L), \u2018tight\u2019 (T) and \u2018open\u2019 (O), or alternatively, as \u2018access\u2019, \u2018binding\u2019 and \u2018extrusion\u2019, (<a href=\"#bib26\">Murakami et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Seeger et al., 2006</a>). On the basis of these structures as well as other findings (<a href=\"#bib43\">Seeger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2009</a>), it has also become generally accepted that drug recognition and efflux are mediated by a sub-domain of the periplasmic region, referred to as the porter domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), whose mechanism is akin to that of a peristaltic pump (<a href=\"#bib42\">Seeger et al., 2006</a>). Specifically, recognition of high molecular-mass drugs occurs in the L state, via an access pocket in the porter domain that is open to the periplasmic space (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakashima et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Eicher et al., 2012</a>). When the L protomer transitions to the T state, drugs translocate to a binding pocket deeper in the protein; low molecular-mass drugs, however, can apparently bind directly to the deep binding pocket in the T protomer without binding to the access pocket first (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakashima et al., 2011</a>). Drug extrusion occurs next, in the transition from T to O, which re-shapes and opens the binding pocket to a central cavity in the funnel domain, which leads to the lumen of the TolC channel. Finally, the O to L transition resets the conformational cycle by re-exposing the binding site to the periplasm. The extensive interface between protomers in the porter domain, and the asymmetric nature of the trimer, also suggest that the three protomers are conformationally coupled (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pos, 2009</a>). Indeed, recent measurements of AcrB transport kinetics (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nagano and Nikaido, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lim and Nikaido, 2010</a>) are consistent with a bi-site activation model (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pos, 2009</a>), analogous to the binding-change mechanism of the ATP synthase (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyer, 1997</a>)."

The asymmetric trimer structures indicate that this domain also cycles between three distinct conformations, and point to several ionizable residues in its core (D407, D408, K940 and R971) that might function as a proton-relay network. Nevertheless, no clear interpretation of existing data has been formulated yet in terms of an alternating-access proton transport mechanism, which is a necessary condition for the transporter to harness the energy stored in the transmembrane electrochemical gradient. How this proton-motive-force is mechanically transduced to the porter domain, in order to power uphill drug efflux, also remains to be determined."

More specifically, we examine the TM domain of the transporter in an improved atomic structure of wildtype AcrB (<a href=\"#bib10\">Eicher et al., 2012</a>), at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution, and also report the structures of four single-substitution variants (D407N, D408N, K940A and R971A), all of which are inactive both in proton translocation and drug efflux, solved at resolutions between 2.0 and 2.3 \u00c5. Taken together with our computational analysis, these data enable us to delineate the alternating-access mechanism of proton transport of the TM domain, and rationalize how this mechanism energizes drug efflux, more than 50 \u00c5 away."

In the porter domain, as noted previously, each protomer consists of two structural repeats, referred to as PN1/PC2, and PN2/PC1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Each repeat is a tandem of two similar \u03b1/\u03b2 sub-domains, joined by a shared \u03b2-strand. The PN1/PC2 repeat appears to be a rigid unit throughout the LTO conformational cycle. Analysis of the conformation of this repeat in the 1.9 \u00c5-resolution crystal structure of wildtype AcrB (<a href=\"#bib10\">Eicher et al., 2012</a>) yields root-mean-square differences (RMSD) among states of less than 0.5 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). By contrast, the PN2/PC1 tandem changes its conformation significantly, in particular in the L to T (RMSD \u223c2.0 \u00c5) and T to O transitions (RMSD \u223c1.8 \u00c5). This is due to the rearrangement of PN2 relative to PC1, rather than to changes in the internal structure of the individual \u03b1/\u03b2 domains, which appear to be quite inflexible across the cycle, in both repeats (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). As described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib26\">Murakami et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Seeger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sennhauser et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pos, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nakashima et al., 2013</a>), the changes in PN2/PC1 reflect binding of the substrate deep within the hydrophobic core of the tandem, in the T state, and its subsequent release into the interior of the funnel domain, in the O state (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>).

To identify these, we quantified the degree of similarity of combinative structural superpositions of fragments of the transmembrane 12-helix bundle in the L, T and O states (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This analysis indicates that the conformational cycle of the TM domain entails relative motions of two structural repeats within each protomer, which had not been previously recognized. Each of these repeats, which we refer to as R1 and R2, comprise five transmembrane \u03b1\u2212helices. The N-terminal repeat, R1, includes TM1 and TM3 to TM6, while the C-terminal repeat, R2, comprises TM7 and TM9 to TM12 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). R1 and R2 are thus oriented in parallel, and are rotated relative to each other approximately 180\u00b0 around an axis perpendicular to the membrane plane. Interestingly, each repeat is flanked by a single transmembrane helix that seems to function as a coupling element with the periplasmic porter domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The flanking helices are TM2 and TM8, respectively; TM2 is linked to the flexible PN2/PC1 repeat in the porter domain, while TM8 is connected to the more rigid PN1/PC2 unit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

When these RMSD values are used as a rank, it becomes clear that combinations that exclude TM2 or TM8 (red) feature systematically smaller differences across the LTO cycle than those that include TM2 or TM8 (black). All other exclusions show no clear correlation. For example, comparing TM1-TM6 (left panel) in L vs T, this increasing ranking is \u0394TM2, \u0394TM4, \u0394TM1, \u0394TM5, \u0394TM3, and \u0394TM6; in T vs O: \u0394TM2, \u0394TM5, \u0394TM4, \u0394TM3, \u0394TM1, and \u0394TM6; and in O vs L: \u0394TM2, \u0394TM5, \u0394TM1, \u0394TM4, \u0394TM3, and \u0394TM6. Furthermore, the data shows that combinations of five helices excluding TM2 and TM8 are not significantly more divergent across the LTO conformers than combinations of four helices. Thus, the asymmetric crystal structure of AcrB captures collective displacements of two 5-helix bundles within each protomer, formed by TM1/TM3-TM6 and TM7/TM9-TM12 (referred to as repeats R1 and R2), relative to flanking helices TM2 and TM8, respectively. Note that comparisons of combinations of seven or more helices result in larger RMSD values than those shown here, and are therefore omitted."

This helix is inserted between TM6 and TM7 in the protein sequence, and thus links R1 and R2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Structurally, however, I\u03b1 is mostly adjacent to R2, and interacts with R1 (via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen-bonds) primarily at the cytoplasmic end of TM2, at a right angle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Our analysis shows that I\u03b1 is effectively part of R2, and that it moves rigidly along with this repeat in the three conformational transitions, most probably in response to the motion of TM2 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This notion is consistent with the finding that MexB, a homolog of AcrB, is functional if the <i>mexB</i> gene is expressed in two halves, split at the N-terminal end of I\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Eda et al., 2003</a>). This construct lacks a direct link between I\u03b1 and TM6 in R1, but likely preserves the large interface between I\u03b1 and R2, as well as the interaction with TM2."

In particular D407 and D408 in TM4 and K940 in TM10 are critical for function (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guan and Nakae, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Murakami and Yamaguchi, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Seeger et al., 2009</a>).

The latest high-resolution (1.9 \u00c5) crystal structure of AcrB (PDB entry 4DX5, <a href=\"#bib10\">Eicher et al., 2012</a>), whose TM domain had not been previously analyzed, reveals in detail how this side-chain network reorganizes throughout the conformational cycle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In both the L and T states, R1 and R2 appear to be strongly paired through multiple interactions. First, through K940, which projects away from R2 and is sandwiched between D407 and D408, from R1, forming two simultaneous ionic interactions. D407 is the acceptor of an additional hydrogen-bond between repeats, namely from T978 in TM11. And lastly, towards the cytoplasm, R971 is in close proximity to E414 and N415, from TM4, particularly in the T state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). (D408 is also the acceptor of an additional hydrogen-bond, but within its own repeat, namely S481 from TM6.) In the O state, by contrast, all R1-R2 interactions break off, and are replaced by alternative ones within each repeat. D407 rotates to engage the backbone of G403, one helix-turn above along TM4; K940 retracts towards R1, and donates hydrogen-bonds to N941 (TM10) and T978; and R971 moves away from E414/N415, and interacts instead with the backbone carbonyl of L944 and the aromatic ring of F948, both in TM10. (D408 also switches interaction partners, to the backbone of L442 in TM5, i.e. also within repeat R1.) In sum, repeats R1 and R2 appear to exchange between an \u2018engaged\u2019 state in the L and T conformations, to a \u2018disengaged\u2019 state, in the O conformation."

First, we conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations of the protonation equilibrium of all aspartate, glutamate and histidine side-chains in the protein under a continuum-electrostatics framework, that is, via the Poisson equation (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In these calculations all lysine and arginine side-chains were assumed to be ionized, except for K940 and R971, which were explicitly analyzed. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> summarizes the results from these simulations, focusing on the TM domain. Most of the aspartate, glutamate and histidine side-chains were found to be deprotonated across the LTO cycle; many of these aspartate and glutamate are engaged in salt-bridges, particularly on the cytoplasmic side of the protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). A handful of residues, however, change their most probable protonation state in the T to O transition. These include D407 and D408, in the core of the TM domain, which are ionized in the L and T states but become protonated in the O state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Interestingly, E346 and D924, at the periplasmic end of TM2 and TM10, respectively, are protonated in the L and T states, but become deprotonated in O; conversely, the neighboring H338 (TM2) and D566 (in the region between TM7 and PC1 subdomain) are most likely deprotonated in L and T, and become protonated in the O state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Lastly, the calculations indicate that both K940 and R971 remain protonated throughout the cycle."

This analysis shows that in the transition from T to O, K940 and R971 lose favorable electrostatic interactions with D407 and D408, as a result of their becoming protonated; however, by re-orienting and retracting towards their own repeat, that is, R2 (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), they gain much of the lost electrostatic energy, by increasing their favorable interactions with other residues in the protein, by minimizing the repulsion between each other, and by increasing their exposure to solvent.

Although the results just described are generally consistent across the range of most plausible values (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kukic et al., 2013</a>), namely 2 to 6, we sought to confirm our conclusions with a second methodology. In particular we used a series of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of AcrB protomers embedded in a phospholipid membrane (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) to calculate the protonation free energy of individual sites, relative to side-chain analogs in bulk water (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Specifically, we computed the free energy of protonation of D407, D408 and K940, in the O state, and of E346 and D924, in the T conformation. The results, shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, reveal strong upward shifts in the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of D407 (in the O conformation), D408(O), E346(T) and D924(T), and a weak downward shift in K940(O), thus confirming that these side-chains are most likely protonated in those protomer states. As controls we also analyzed E693(T) and K603(O), which are located on the solvent-exposed surface of the periplasmic PC2 subdomain; as expected, the calculated p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> shifts for these side-chains are small or negligible (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In sum, both all-atom molecular simulations and continuum-electrostatic calculations indicate that in the L and T states, two protons are bound to the TM domain of AcrB at the periplasmic side (i.e., D924 and E346), while D407 and D408, two-thirds of the way across the membrane, are deprotonated; upon transition to the O state, two protons bind to D407 and D408, while the proton-accepting sites on the periplasmic face become deprotonated."

Our results suggest that the primary role of these side-chains is not, however, to capture and donate protons; instead, they appear to function as a conformational electrostatic switch coupled to the protonation state of D407 and D408. In the L and T states both K940 and R971 have strong favorable interactions with ionized D407 and D408, which exceed their mutual repulsion (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Neutralization of D407 and D408, in the transition to the O state, alters this electrostatic balance. As a result, K940 and R971 reorient to reduce their electrostatic repulsion and to maximize alternative favorable interactions within the protein, particularly within repeat R2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We propose that the re-configuration of this reversible electrostatic switch, which is coupled to the protonation and deprotonation of both D407 and D408, is the trigger for the lateral displacements of repeat R2 relative to R1 observed in the T to O and O to L transitions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>)."

That is, these two substitutions appear to perturb the conformational cycle of the transporter by altering the energetic balance between the L, T and O states, rather than by precluding the protomers from adopting native-like conformations in each of these states. Indeed, electrostatic calculations analogous to those carried out for the wildtype protein show that in the K940A structure, D408 is constitutively neutralized throughout the cycle. D407, which is more proximal to R971, is deprotonated in the L and T states and protonated in the O state, as in the wildtype (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly for the D408N variant, D407 is predicted to become protonated only in the O state, while the substituted N408 is evidently neutral throughout the cycle (K940 and R971 are protonated in all states in both mutants) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These results imply that the ionic interactions across the R1-R2 interface that stabilize the L and T states are weakened in the mutants. By contrast, the O state is probably less affected (K940A) or not at all (D408N), since the repeats become disengaged in this state. This change in the energetic balance of the conformational cycle (which for example would hinder the transition from O to L) would explain the drastic functional effect of these two mutations."

In R971A, like in K940A, a first proton is already bound to the protomer in the L and T states (alternating between D407 and D408, respectively) and a second proton binds in the O state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In D407N, like in D408N, only one proton is loaded (on D408), and only in the O state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Thus, also in these two variants is the key ionic interaction network at the R1-R2 interface partially neutralized in the L and T states. The R971A and D407N substitutions, however, not only perturb the energetics of the conformational cycle and the transduction of the proton electrochemical gradient, but also seem to preclude the protomers from adopting all the native-like conformations, particularly the T state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The structure of R971A shows that K940 is engaged only with D408 in the L state (while D407 is protonated). In the T state, K940 switches towards D407 (while D408 is protonated), adopting a configuration that is arguably an intermediate between the native T and O states: first, in that K940 retracts away from the repeat interface, unhindered by the now absent repulsion with R971, while still paired with D407; and second, in that as a result D407 loses its hydrogen bond to T978 across the R1-R2 interface. Consistent with our hypothesis that the structural configuration of the proton-relay network is intimately coupled to the displacements of the 5-helix repeats, the arrangement of these repeats in the T protomer of the R971A crystal structure is an intermediate between the T and O states of the wildtype structure (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>); in fact, this altered conformation is more similar to the latter (RMSD values of 2.4 vs 1.6 \u00c5, respectively\u2014<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3C</a>)."

In the L state this appears to be compensated by an alternative hydrogen-bond donated by N941, but this interaction is not feasible in the T state. In addition, the asparagine substitution removes the attractive electrostatic interaction between D407 with R971. In sum, the interaction network at the R1-R2 interface is partially disengaged. Consequently, the T state in the D407N structure shows R1 and R2 partially displaced, in a conformation that is again intermediate between the wildtype T and O states (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3C</a>)."

Because the porter and transmembrane domains are necessarily coupled, it is conceivable that the DARPins inhibit the structural impact of the mutations, that is, only the strongest perturbations (R971A and D407N) would translate into noticeable structural differences in our experiment. Thus, we cannot rule out that the lack of activity of these mutants reflects structural perturbations more significant than those observed here. Nonetheless, even the relatively modest changes revealed by the structures presented here support the conclusions of our analysis of wildtype AcrB. That is, that there is a causal relationship between the displacements of the repeats R1 and R2 within the TM domain and the configuration of the proton-dependent electrostatic network at the R1-R2 interface; that there is a conformational and electrostatic coupling between R971 and K940 and the two aspartate side-chains that serve as proton-binding sites; and lastly, that the transitions from T to O and O to L, which power the peristaltic pump mechanism of the porter domain, entail binding and release of two protons at D407 and D408."

In the case of proton-driven secondary transporters, these pathways must also be dependent on the conformational state of the protein, that is, they must be consistent with an alternating-access mechanism, so as to preclude leakage and ensure strict coupling of substrate and proton transport. To examine whether the conformational cycle of AcrB indeed implies changes in proton accessibility, we carried out an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the complete trimer in a lipid membrane, and analyzed the formation and persistence of hydration channels across the TM domain. The results, summarized in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, indicate that the LTO conformational cycle described above does indeed involve a mechanism of alternating access. More specifically, we observe that the L state permits the formation of two persistent water channels open to the cytoplasm, at the interface between repeats R1 and R2, and reaching into the proton-binding site; access from the periplasmic space is, however, closed (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). In the T state, by contrast, two narrow water wires form on the periplasmic face of the TM domain, again reaching into the proton-binding site, and approximately along the interface between the two repeats R1 and R2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Interestingly, E346 and D924 flank the entrance of each of these water wires; as mentioned earlier, both these side-chains are likely to be protonated in the L and T states and deprotonated in the O state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), which suggests that E346 and D924 facilitate proton uptake by providing transient binding sites en route to D407/D408 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fischer and Kandt, 2011</a>). On the cytoplasmic side, we also observed a narrow water wire, flanked by R971, which is thus unlikely to sustain proton transfer, as discussed below. Finally, the O state features two water channels into the proton-binding site that are highly similar to those seen in the L conformation, that is, open to the cytoplasm, while access from the periplasmic space is also occluded (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, the structure of the T state in wildtype AcrB features the abovementioned continuous water wire flanked by TM10, connecting the periplasmic space and D407/D408, with D924 at its entrance. The second outward-open wire, with E346 at its entrance and running along the interface between TM2-TM4 and TM11, cannot be discerned in the wildtype structure, but interestingly, is partially resolved in the structures of D407N and R971A (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). As discussed earlier, in these crystals the T protomer is captured in an intermediate conformation between wildtype T and O, in which the lateral displacement of repeat R2 is already underway (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In the native membrane and at room temperature, the two repeats would be much more dynamic than what appears in the crystal lattice, and thus we envisage that both water wires co-exist, also in the wildtype protein, as we observe in the simulation. In any case, it is apparent that no water wires connect the central proton-binding site and the periplasmic space in the L and O states, in any of the structures. By contrast, a significant number of ordered water molecules are observed in the intracellular side of these protomers. According to our simulation, the cytoplasmic channels, and particularly that between TM5 and TM10, are highly dynamic, and thus electron densities in this region would be poorly defined. Nevertheless, ordered water can be clearly discerned in the proximity of the proton-binding site, particularly in the L state (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>)."

As mentioned, this is a necessary condition in order for the transporter to harness the proton-motive-force. Interestingly, two distinct types of relative motion of repeats R1 and R2 result in alternating access, namely a rocking motion during the L to T transition, with no protons bound, and a shear motion in the T to O transition, in the protonated form. This finding indicates that other transporters may also follow significantly different conformational pathways in the substrate-bound and apo segments of their functional cycle, contrary to what is often assumed. To our knowledge, however, AcrB is the only secondary-transporter for which two distinct structural transitions resulting in alternating access have been described to date."

In the L to T transition, substrate binding in the deep binding pocket of the porter domain causes a structural change within the PN2/PC1 unit. This change translates into the downward displacement of TM2, which pushes on I\u03b1 and causes it to swing away, along with whole of the R2 repeat (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In this transition, the interaction network formed by the proton-relay triad, D407, D408 and K940, remains engaged (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), with all three side-chains ionized (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), and seems to provide the hinge point of the swinging motion of R1 and R2 relative to each other (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Importantly, this motion leads to alternating access of pathways for protons from either side of the membrane. Specifically, while in the L state the triad is accessible only from the cytoplasm, in the T state protons can only enter the TM domain from the periplasm (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In both cases, proton transfer is highly likely to be mediated by water channels formed at the interface between repeats, which open or close as the repeats themselves rearrange relative to each other."

The combinations shown in green are the most feasible from a steric standpoint; these are also sufficient to draw a complete transport cycle that, arguably, would be also ideal from a kinetic standpoint, as it would minimize the chances of drug re-binding after extrusion into the TolC lumen (see manuscript).

K940 remains in the ionized, protonated state, and retracts towards TM10/TM11 to compensate for the loss of interaction partners. R971 (on TM11) also reconfigures in response to these events, rotating towards TM10. As a result, the repeats R1 and R2 become disengaged, and R2 (along with I\u03b1) moves laterally relative to R1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This displacement allows TM2 to return to the up conformation, and importantly, enables TM8 to come into close proximity to R2. The displacement of TM8 causes the PN1/PC2 repeat in the porter domain to move, as a rigid body, against PN2/PC1, thus closing the binding cleft to the periplasmic space, and triggers instead the opening of an exit pathway towards the funnel domain. The ability of TM8 to steer the motion of PN1/PC2 in the T to O step (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) seems to be facilitated by the elongation of the helical fold of TM8, on the periplasmic side, upon transition from L to T (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>); this naturally facilitates its coupling to the motion of PN1/PC2. Crucially, in the O state the proton-relay site is again accessible to the cytoplasm, and not to the periplasm (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Thus, deprotonation will imply a release of the bound protons down the electrochemical gradient. Proton release into the cell interior also causes the R1 and R2 repeats to re-engage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), and thus the dissociation of TM8 from R2 when reforming the L state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This enables the re-opening of the drug-binding cleft between PC1 and PC2, exposing the access binding pocket (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakashima et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Eicher et al., 2012</a>) to the periplasm, ready to sequester a new drug molecule."

Thus, the free-energy gain associated with downhill proton permeation compensates the cost of uphill efflux of cytotoxic compounds. This energy-transduction process is reminiscent of the binding-change mechanism of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase, which also utilizes the energy harnessed from the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient to release synthesized ATP molecules from their binding sites in the \u03b1/\u03b2 subunits (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyer, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pos, 2009</a>)."

Indeed, transport of certain cephalosporins and penicillins has been shown to be highly cooperative (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nagano and Nikaido, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lim and Nikaido, 2010</a>). How the cross-talk among protomers might benefit the antiport mechanism is, however, not immediately evident. From an architectural standpoint, trimerization is necessary for AcrB to form a pore leading into the TolC channel, but why would the protomers not cycle independently from each other? A disadvantage of independent protomer cycling would be that a drug released into the exit pore by a protomer in the O state would often be exposed to a second protomer also in the O state, which would enhance the probability of re-binding. Such event would not likely result in drug re-uptake (which would require uphill proton transport) but efflux would be surely hindered from a kinetic standpoint, because the drug concentration within TolC is probably very large. Ideally, therefore, the number of trimer configurations in which one or more protomer are in the O state ought to be somehow minimized. Following the same kinetic argument, it would be advantageous if AcrB maximizes the number of trimer configurations featuring the L and T states in one or more protomers, so as to accelerate capture (or re-capture) of the substrate from the periplasmic space or the inner membrane."

Wildtype and mutagenized AcrB structures were analyzed via Monte-Carlo/Poisson-equation simulations of the global protonation equilibrium in the complete trimer. In addition, selected ionizable side-chains in the wildtype transporter were analyzed via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of individual protomers, using the free-energy perturbation (FEP) method. To assess the most likely protonation state of the ionizable side-chains in AcrB, we carried out a series of Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations of the global protonation equilibrium of the protein at fixed pH. In a first set of calculations, we analyzed in each protomer separately, including all ionizable side-chains in the calculation. All lysine and arginine side-chains were consistently predicted to be protonated at the pH and dielectric constant values used in these calculations (see below). Thus, in subsequent simulations, in which the complete trimer was considered, all lysine and arginine side-chains were fixed in their ionized state, except for K940 and R971, which were explicitly re-analyzed along with all aspartate, histidine and glutamate residues (306 side-chains in total)."

The equilibration phases, in which the temperature was kept at 300 K, lasted 500,000 steps. The protonation probability of each group was determined by averaging the ionisation states sampled during the equilibration phase of the final cycle of the simulation.

To optimize the protein-solvent and protein-lipid interfaces in the model, and to thermalize the system, a series of short simulations (10 ns) were initially carried out with gradually weaker positional restraints applied to the protein and the crystallographic and DOWSER-added water molecules (excluding hydrogen atoms). To enable the protein to tumble, the equilibration phase was extended (5 ns) after replacing the positional restraints with collective conformational restraints (RMSD), applied first to the whole protein, and subsequently to each of three transmembrane domains separately. In the last state of the equilibration (10 ns), only the configuration of the proton-relay network was preserved via inter-residue distance restraints (flat-bottom harmonic potential).

The preparation and equilibration of these reduced simulation systems was analogous to the procedure followed for the trimer. In the final production phase (90 ns), however, only the transmembrane domain was fully unrestrained. The conformation of the porter domain was preserved using a harmonic restraint on its RMSD relative to the crystal structure, to preclude any distortions resulting from the artefactual truncation of the funnel domain. Importantly, the force constant of this harmonic restraint was selected so that the structural fluctuations of the porter domain in the truncated-protomer system are comparable to those observed in the unrestrained simulations of the complete trimer (not shown). Thus, the dynamics of the transmembrane domain during the free-energy calculations is unlikely to be significantly affected by the truncation. For both T and O protomers, snapshots after 90 ns of simulation were extracted and used to initiate the FEP calculations. Here, the protonation state of a given side-chain is exchanged alchemically, using a step-wise protocol controlled by a parameter \u03bb that reflects the weight of either protonation state in the potential energy function of the system. All FEP calculations were carried out in the forward and backward directions, with 38 intermediate \u03bb steps (33 for D408 in the O state). The simulation time per \u03bb step was 1 ns; the initial 100 ps of each simulation were considered as equilibration, and so free-energy increments were obtained from the final 900 ps."

This conclusion is at odds with the recent EM studies by Du et al. (Nature, 2014), which indicate no direct contact between TolC and AcrB. At the time of the submission of our article, the results of Du et al. had not been made public yet. A change in nomenclature seems appropriate now.

However, this earlier publication was exclusively focused on novel aspects of drug recognition in the porter domain, and not on the mechanism of the transmembrane domain, or its coupling with the porter domain. Regarding the quality of the data, it is true that the L state appears to be more dynamic than the other two states; for example, the atomic B-factors for the residues shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> are in general higher in the L state (between 48 and 78 A<sup>2</sup>) than in the T and O states (between 31 and 60 A<sup>2</sup>).

Under conditions where no drug was added to the growth medium, these cells grew to OD600 values comparable to those cells expressing wildtype AcrB or other variants. There are a number of ways to interpret these results, but we believe the most plausible explanation is that in the absence of drug, AcrB adopts the symmetric LLL state observed in X-ray structures that lack a bound substrate. The absence of a T protomer in this \u2018resting state\u2019 of the trimer would explain the lack of H<sup>+</sup> leakage."

We routinely use passive loading and active efflux experiments with fluorescent dyes to test the efflux activity of AcrB variants and take either D407N or D408N clones as negative controls. Thus far, we have not observed any activity in these assays. The assay based on hydrolysis of cephalosporins (Lim and Nikaido, AAC, 2010) might be indeed more suitable to detect residual activity, since acrAB knock out strains produce only 1% of the efflux activity compared to wildtype. However, this assay requires a special set-up of the spectrophotometer, currently not available in our lab, to reduce scattering caused by the measurements with whole <i>E. coli</i> cells."

That is, drugs are not transported from the cytoplasm across the plasma membrane, but only across the outer membrane. For protons, however, AcrB mediates classical transport from the periplasm to the cytoplasm, to harness the electrochemical gradient and energize the conformational changes necessary for active efflux of drugs. Consequently, the charge of the transported drugs is not a relevant factor i.e. the overall process of transport will be electrogenic for every drug molecule transported from the periplasm to the outside, regardless of its charge. The thermodynamic quantity that depends on whether each transport cycle is coupled to one or two H<sup>+</sup> is the magnitude of the substrate gradient sustained by the action of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. Comparing MIC data from cells lacking AcrB with those with active AcrB, it appears that the pump is in some cases able to sustain gradients larger than 1:1000, e.g. for the substrate oxacillin (Kobayashi et al., JBC, 2014). The energetic cost required to sustain such gradients would exceed the energy gain associated with the transport of a single proton across a membrane potential of \u223c-180 mV. These observations, in combination with the structural information we obtained for the three different states (L and T with no protons bound to Asp407 and Asp408, vs. two protons bound to these residues in the O state) and the two alternating-access pathways deduced by the MD simulation studies, strongly indicate a H<sup>+</sup>:drug stoichiometry of 2:1. Clearly, direct experimental evidence from reconstituted AcrAB-TolC in proteoliposomes would settle this question, but this remains an experimental challenge, due to the complexity of this two-membrane spanning tripartite system."
