The mechanistic basis for its action, however, is only poorly understood. Here, we have established a physical assay to determine whether the binding of condensin to native chromosomes in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> involves entrapment of DNA by the Smc\u2013ScpAB ring. To do so, we have chemically cross-linked the three ring interfaces in Smc\u2013ScpAB and thereafter isolated intact chromosomes under protein denaturing conditions. Exclusively species of Smc\u2013ScpA, which were previously cross-linked into covalent rings, remained associated with chromosomal DNA. DNA entrapment is abolished by mutations that interfere with the Smc ATPase cycle and strongly reduced when the recruitment factor ParB is deleted, implying that most Smc\u2013ScpAB is loaded onto the chromosome at <i>parS</i> sites near the replication origin. We furthermore report a physical interaction between native Smc\u2013ScpAB and chromosomal DNA fragments."

The mechanistic basis for its action, however, is only poorly understood. Here, we have established a physical assay to determine whether the binding of condensin to native chromosomes in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> involves entrapment of DNA by the Smc\u2013ScpAB ring. To do so, we have chemically cross-linked the three ring interfaces in Smc\u2013ScpAB and thereafter isolated intact chromosomes under protein denaturing conditions. Exclusively species of Smc\u2013ScpA, which were previously cross-linked into covalent rings, remained associated with chromosomal DNA. DNA entrapment is abolished by mutations that interfere with the Smc ATPase cycle and strongly reduced when the recruitment factor ParB is deleted, implying that most Smc\u2013ScpAB is loaded onto the chromosome at <i>parS</i> sites near the replication origin. We furthermore report a physical interaction between native Smc\u2013ScpAB and chromosomal DNA fragments."

Multi-subunit Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes\u2014such as cohesin and condensin\u2014are major determinants of chromosome structure and dynamics during the cell cycle in eukaryotes as well as in prokaryotes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hirano, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Thadani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gruber, 2014</a>). Condensin subunits were initially identified as abundant, non-histone components of mitotic chromosomes in metazoans (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</a>). In mitosis, condensin localizes together with topoisomerase II in punctate structures to the longitudinal core of chromatids, called the chromosome axis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coelho et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Maeshima and Laemmli, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ono et al., 2004</a>). Inactivation of condensin subunits by mutation or depletion results in severe morphological aberrations and mechanical sensitivity of metaphase chromosomes, and subsequently to defects in their segregation during anaphase (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ono et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gerlich et al., 2006</a>). In bacteria, Smc\u2013ScpAB is the prevalent version of SMC protein complexes. Its distant relatives MksBEF and MukBEF can be found scarcely scattered over most of the bacterial phylogenetic tree and in isolated branches of proteobacteria, respectively (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gruber, 2011</a>). In <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, Smc\u2013ScpAB is recruited to a region around the replication origin by ParB/Spo0J protein bound to <i>parS</i> sites, thereby forming a discrete focus\u2014also called condensation center\u2014on each nascent copy of the chromosome (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gruber and Errington, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sullivan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Minnen et al., 2011</a>). Inactivation of Smc\u2013ScpAB in <i>B. subtilis</i> under nutrient rich growth conditions blocks separation of sister replication origins and consequentially leads to lethal defects in chromosome partitioning (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gruber et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Smc\u2013ScpAB thus promotes the initial stages of chromosome segregation in <i>B. subtilis</i>, likely by condensing and individualizing the emerging copies of the chromosome in preparation for their segregation to opposite halves of the cell."

Overall, the pentameric Smc\u2013ScpAB complex displays a highly extended conformation harboring a central channel, which is surrounded by a closed tripartite ring formed by the Smc dimer and the ScpAB<sub>2</sub> sub-complex. The <i>B. subtilis</i> Smc coiled coils associate with one another to form rod-shaped Smc dimers (<a href=\"#bib45\">Soh et al., 2015</a>).

Such protein preparations support the bridging of given DNA molecules in vitro as indicated by the re-annealing of single stranded DNA, intermolecular DNA ligation, DNA catenation and the co-purification of labeled and unlabeled DNA molecules (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sutani and Yanagida, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Losada and Hirano, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cui et al., 2008</a>). Many SMC complexes bound to different segments of DNA might thus come together and anchor DNA in condensation centers or at the chromosome axis. Oligomeric assemblies of bacterial Smc proteins have indeed been observed by Atomic Force Microscopy and Electron Microscopy (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mascarenhas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fuentes-Perez et al., 2012</a>). This model provides a straightforward explanation for the compaction activity of SMC. However, it is unclear how such apparently indiscriminate DNA aggregation would promote rather than block the individualization of sister chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gruber, 2014</a>). Local wrapping of DNA around the SMC complex could result in well-defined lengthwise condensation of DNA. However, too little SMC protein appears to be present in chromosomes to yield decent levels of compaction by simple wrapping. A different hypothesis is based on the finding that the structurally related cohesin complex holds sister chromatids in eukaryotes together by entrapping sister DNA fibers within its ring (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gruber et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gligoris et al., 2014</a>). Accordingly, individual SMC complexes might entrap and expand loops of DNA, thereby driving lengthwise condensation of chromosomes with little limitations in the attainable levels of compaction (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nasmyth, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alipour and Marko, 2012</a>)."

However, several attempts failed to provide clear evidence for entrapment of small circular DNA by prokaryotic condensin. Conceivably, Smc\u2013ScpAB does not interact with these artificial substrates in a physiological manner. To circumvent this possibility, we established an inverse assay by immobilizing whole chromosomes of <i>B. subtilis</i> in agarose plugs and monitoring their association with covalently closed rings of Smc\u2013ScpA under harsh protein denaturing conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To develop the chromosome entrapment assay we first performed experiments with the replicative sliding clamp, DnaN, in <i>B. subtilis</i>, which is known to entrap DNA in a topological manner. Furthermore, most of cellular DnaN protein is maintained in the vicinity of active replication forks in <i>B. subtilis</i>, presumably by its topological association with leading and lagging strand DNA (<a href=\"#bib46\">Su'etsugu and Errington, 2011</a>)."

For detection a cys-less variant of the HaloTag (\u2018HT\u2019) was fused to the C-terminus of DnaN (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and the construct was integrated into the genome of <i>B. subtilis</i> via allelic replacement at the endogenous locus. The <i>dnaN-ht</i> genes with and without cysteine mutations supported normal growth of <i>B. subtilis</i>, implying that they encoded functional DnaN proteins (data not shown). In vivo cross-linking of DnaN-HT resulted in two additional, slow migrating bands in SDS-PAGE gels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), corresponding to single and double cross-linked species of DnaN dimers, designated as X-DnaN-HT and XX-DnaN-HT, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We next embedded cells in agarose plugs and disrupted their cell walls by lysozyme digestion. Agarose plugs were then subjected to an electric field in the presence of SDS to denature and remove any unattached proteins from chromosomes. Plugs were finally treated with benzonase to digest genomic DNA and to release any stably entrapped protein. DnaN-HT protein was then analysed by in-gel fluorescence. Non-crosslinkable DnaN-HT was efficiently depleted from agarose plugs during the entrapment assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, the double cross-linked, circular form of DnaN(N114C, V313C)-HT (XX-DnaN-HT) was retained in the agarose plug during electrophoresis with high efficiency (\u223c50% of input). A minor fraction of single cross-linked DnaN dimer (X-DnaN-HT) was also observed. This is likely generated from XX-DnaN-HT by spontaneous hydrolysis of thiol-malemide adducts during protein isolation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kalia and Raines, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baldwin and Kiick, 2013</a>). Importantly, the presence of benzonase during cell lysis eliminated all DnaN from the plug, indicating that circular DnaN is retained in plugs via its interaction with cellular DNA. Furthermore, in the absence of the cross-linker BMOE, no DnaN-HT was detected in the eluate fraction (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The chromosome entrapment assay thus specifically detects a topological association of intact chromosomes with DNA sliding clamps and confirms that a major fraction (at least 50%) of DnaN is loaded onto DNA in rapidly growing cells."

                                "text": "Next, we used the newly developed chromosome entrapment assay to test for an association between native chromosomes and Smc\u2013ScpAB complexes. Cysteine pairs were introduced at the Smc\u2013Smc and at both Smc\u2013ScpA interfaces and a HT was fused at the C-terminus of Smc to allow in-gel fluorescence detection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">B\u00fcrmann et al., 2013</a>). Strains bearing the cysteine mutations and the Smc-HaloTag fusion supported normal growth on nutrient rich medium demonstrating the functionality of the modified Smc complex (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Cells were treated with BMOE and extracts were analysed by SDS-PAGE. As internal control for the chromosome entrapment assay we employed the DnaN(N114C, V313C) protein, whose double cross-linked form was detected in input and eluate samples by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Various species of Smc\u2013ScpAB were identified in extracts of BMOE cross-linked cells by in-gel fluorescence. These correspond to fully cross-linked Smc\u2013ScpA\u2013Smc rings and several intermediate cross-linking species as reported previously (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">B\u00fcrmann et al., 2013</a>). To reveal the identity of all species, strains lacking one of six engineered cysteines were used as controls that collectively form several intermediate cross-linked species but no fully cross-linked rings of Smc\u2013ScpAB (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In these control samples little or no Smc-HT protein was retained in agarose plugs under denaturing conditions as expected for any non-circular protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In the presence of all pairs of cysteine, however, a set of two closely migrating species was consistently detected at significant levels after the chromosome entrapment assay (\u223c10\u201320% of input material) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We argued that the two closely migrating species might correspond to Smc\u2013ScpAB with a single or a double cross-link at the Smc hinge. Consistent with this notion we find that only a single species of Smc<sub>2</sub>\u2013ScpA accumulated during the chromosome entrapment assay when a single cysteine residue (R643C) was used to cross-link the Smc hinge domains (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). These findings strongly suggest that Smc\u2013ScpAB is bound to chromosomes via entrapment of chromosomal DNA. If this were indeed the case, then its retention in agarose plugs should depend on the integrity of Smc\u2013ScpAB rings and of chromosomal DNA. Incubation of agarose plugs with the nuclease benzonase during cell lysis eliminated the Smc-HT and DnaN signal in the sample (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To disrupt covalent Smc\u2013ScpAB rings, we inserted cleavage sites for TEV protease into the linker region preceding the C-terminal WHD of ScpA and incubated cells during lysozyme treatment with recombinant TEV protease to open any circular Smc<sub>2</sub>\u2013ScpA species. As expected, little or no Smc-HT signal was detected in agarose plugs after TEV cleavage of ScpA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To exclude any artefacts due to the presence of the HT on Smc we have repeated the chromosome entrapment assay with an untagged allele of Smc using immunoblotting with anti-Smc antibodies for the detection of cross-linked species, which yielded very similar results (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Furthermore, we found that Smc<sub>2</sub>-ScpA rings are stably trapped in agarose plugs over extended periods of time in constant or alternating electric fields (data not shown). Thus, our chromosome entrapment assay specifically detects the association between intact chromosomal DNA and rings of Smc\u2013ScpAB in <i>B. subtilis</i>, demonstrating that DNA fibers pass through the Smc ring."

More specifically, ATP hydrolysis has been hypothesized to transiently open an entry gate for DNA in the cohesin ring during its loading onto chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gruber et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2011</a>). To test what steps of the ATP hydrolysis cycle in Smc\u2013ScpAB are involved in the entrapment of chromosomal DNA, we made use of <i>smc</i> alleles harboring mutations that specifically prevent ATP binding (K37I), engagement of Smc head domains (S1090R) or ATP hydrolysis (E1118Q) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hirano and Hirano, 2004</a>). The three mutant proteins are expressed at normal levels in <i>B. subtilis</i> being indicative of proper protein folding (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, they do not support growth on nutrient rich medium similar to <i>smc</i> null mutants, implying that all steps of the ATPase cycle are essential for Smc functionality (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gruber et al., 2014</a>). For the chromosome entrapment assay, these Smc ATPase mutations were combined with cysteine mutations for BMOE cross-linking. To support their viability, the resulting strains as well as the wild-type controls were grown in minimal medium. The three mutant Smc proteins assembled into normal Smc\u2013ScpAB complexes as judged by Smc\u2013ScpA cross-linking, albeit there is a slight decrease in the fraction of ScpA proteins bridging Smc dimers and a concomitant minor increase in ScpA subunits bound to single Smc proteins (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, species \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib6\">B\u00fcrmann et al., 2013</a>). Intriguingly, the ATP binding and engagement mutants abolished the fraction of covalent ring species retained in the agarose plug during the chromosome entrapment assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In case of the ATP hydrolysis mutant Smc(E1118Q) only minute amounts of cross-linked rings were recovered from SDS treated plugs. This small fraction of stably bound condensin conceivably arises as a consequence of residual levels of ATP hydrolysis activity in Smc(E1118Q) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hirano and Hirano, 2004</a>). Thus, ATP binding and ATP dependent Smc head engagement\u2014and most probably also ATP hydrolysis\u2014are essential for entrapment of chromosomal DNA by condensin in bacteria, as has been supposed for cohesin in yeast. Furthermore, the strict requirement of several steps of the ATPase cycle strongly suggests that entrapment of DNA corresponds to the physiological form of association with the bacterial chromosome."

ParB might act by simply increasing the local concentration of Smc\u2013ScpAB around <i>oriC</i> either before or after its loading onto the chromosome. Alternatively, ParB bound to <i>parS</i> sites might be more directly involved in the loading reaction itself, for example, as catalytic factor, and its absence might thus affect levels of chromosomal condensin. To test this, we performed the chromosome entrapment assay with cells lacking the <i>parB</i> gene. Intriguingly, the levels of Smc\u2013ScpAB entrapping chromosomal DNA were strongly reduced in the <i>parB</i> null mutant as judged by the limited retention of Smc\u2013ScpA species in agarose plugs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, ParB protein likely promotes the entrapment of chromosomal DNA by Smc\u2013ScpAB. This strongly suggests that most condensin is loaded onto the chromosome at <i>parS</i> sites, where ParB protein is bound. In all other parts of the chromosome entrapment of DNA fibers by Smc\u2013ScpAB might be very inefficient.

We found that these mutations strongly impair loading of Smc onto the chromosome in the entrapment assay similar to <i>\u0394parB</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The R149G mutation is positioned on the helix-turn-helix motif of ParB and might thus directly affect binding to <i>parS</i> sites (<a href=\"#bib36\">Leonard et al., 2004</a>). The N112S mutation, however, is located in another highly conserved region, which has been implicated in the \u2018spreading\u2019 of ParB protein from <i>parS</i> sequences into adjacent DNA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Leonard et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Graham et al., 2014</a>). The spreading of ParB along several kb of DNA is a feature conserved in plasmid and chromosome derived ParB proteins, however, the underlying mechanism is only poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rodionov et al., 1999</a>). It might possibly involve the formation of a large nucleoprotein complex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Broedersz et al., 2014</a>). Several other mutants of ParB (including <i>B. subtilis</i> ParB G77S and R80A) have been reported to be defective in spreading from <i>parS</i> sites (<a href=\"#bib4\">Breier and Grossman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Graham et al., 2014</a>). Intriguingly, also these mutations resulted in largely reduced levels of Smc on the chromosome in our entrapment assay, being comparable to the levels found in a <i>parB</i> deletion mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This implies that ParB spreading from <i>parS</i> sites or formation of large nucleoprotein complexes might be essential for loading of DNA into the Smc ring by ParB. These findings are consistent with the observation that formation of Smc-GFP foci near the origin of replication are affected by the G77S mutation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sullivan et al., 2009</a>). In summary, these results demonstrate that several factors\u2014including ScpB protein, a ParB/<i>parS</i> nucleoprotein complex and the Smc ATPase cycle\u2014are required to promote efficient loading of condensin rings onto the chromosome."

The physical contacts with DNA might occur once condensin has been successfully loaded onto chromosomes and thus be a permanent feature of chromosomal Smc\u2013ScpAB. Alternatively, the direct association with DNA might be restricted to certain intermediates in the chromosomal loading reaction. To test for interactions between Smc\u2013ScpAB and specific chromosomal DNA fragments, we have affinity-purified endogenous Smc\u2013ScpAB from <i>B. subtilis</i> cell lysates using a short Avitag peptide fused to the C-terminus of the Smc protein, which gets biotinylated when the biotin ligase gene <i>birA</i> is co-expressed (\u2018Smc-Avitag\u2019). We then examined fractions for the co-purification of fragments of chromosomal DNA\u2014generated by restriction digest with XbaI\u2014using quantitative PCR with primer pairs specific for different parts of the chromosome. Since we worried that Smc\u2013ScpAB might not be sufficiently stable in diluted cell extracts, we cross-linked the three ring interfaces in Smc\u2013ScpAB using BMOE cross-linking of engineered pairs of cysteines. A small fraction of chromosomal DNA was reproducibly co-purified with wild-type Smc-Avitag, whereas the yield of co-purified DNA was significantly improved by the presence of cross-linkable cysteine residues in Smc\u2013ScpAB (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In both cases origin-proximal regions (<i>yyaD</i>, <i>parS-359</i>, <i>dnaA</i> and <i>dnaN</i>) of the chromosome were more efficiently enriched than distal regions (<i>amyE</i>, <i>trnS</i> and <i>ter</i>) by the co-purification with Smc implying that the observed Smc-DNA contacts are dependent on chromosomal loading of Smc\u2013ScpAB by ParB protein at <i>parS</i> sites and are thus physiologically relevant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gruber and Errington, 2009</a>). The association of DNA with wild-type and BMOE cross-linked Smc\u2013ScpAB was highly sensitive to washes with a salt solution (2M NaCl), suggesting that it was dependent on electrostatic contacts between DNA and protein. These DNA contacts are presumably formed by the Smc\u2013ScpAB complex itself. Alternatively, albeit less likely, other chromosomal proteins physically bound to DNA could prevent the release of condensin from DNA by blocking its sliding towards DNA ends."

The eukaryotic variants cohesin and condensin have been suggested to work as concatenases, which hold selected stretches of DNA together by simple embracement in their ring (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haering et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cuylen et al., 2011</a>). Whether DNA entrapment is an ancestral and thus fundamentally conserved function of SMC\u2013kleisin complexes, however, remained elusive so far. Furthermore, interaction studies developed for cohesin and condensin are based on small, artificial DNA substrates and might thus not necessarily reflect the mode of binding to native chromosomes. These assays also fall short of providing an estimate for the fraction of SMC complexes involved in interlocked associations with DNA and thus leave open the possibility that DNA entrapment might be an insignificant side reaction. Finally, it has not been tested under physiological conditions, whether the ATPase cycle is required for proper loading of DNA into any SMC\u2013kleisin complex. To provide answers to these questions, we have established the chromosome entrapment assay to determine the association of prokaryotic condensin with native chromosomes. Our results clearly demonstrate that chromosomal DNA is loaded into condensin complexes in <i>B. subtilis</i>\u2014in a manner that depends on the non-SMC subunit ScpB and at least one full cycle of Smc ATPase activity. The chromosome entrapment assay recovers about 10\u201320% of the fully cross-linked input material. This number probably understates the real proportion of chromosomally entrapped Smc complexes due to the loss of material during protein re-isolation from agarose plugs, due to possible adverse effects of cysteine mutations on Smc\u2013ScpAB loading and because cysteine-maleimide linkages are vulnerable to hydrolytic reversal during and after the entrapment assay (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kalia and Raines, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baldwin and Kiick, 2013</a>). Interestingly, a recent single-molecule tracking study in <i>B. subtilis</i> revealed two major populations of Smc: 80% of Smc-YFP proteins are displaying highly dynamic behavior on the nucleoid, whereas the other 20% (and most ScpA-YFP protein) are immobile and constrained within a small volume of the cell (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kleine Borgmann et al., 2013</a>). This immobile fraction possibly represents Smc\u2013ScpAB complexes embracing origin proximal DNA after loading at <i>parS</i> sites as observed in the entrapment assay."

Therefore, it remains to be determined whether DNA entrapment by Smc\u2013ScpAB is of topological (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and/or non-topological (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) nature."

It is tempting to speculate that ParB/<i>parS</i> not only enriches Smc in the vicinity of the replication origin but also sets up lengthwise compaction of chromosomes by presenting DNA of a certain topology to the Smc\u2013ScpAB complex. Consistent with this notion, we found that several <i>parB</i> mutants, which are defective in the ability to form large nucleoprotein complexes and to spread from <i>parS</i> sites, fail to promote loading of Smc\u2013ScpAB onto the chromosome. Thus, Smc\u2013ScpAB might capture, stabilize and expand structures\u2013such as DNA loops or coils\u2013that are pre-formed within larger ParB/<i>parS</i> nucleoprotein assemblies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Alternatively, ParB/<i>parS</i> might serve as an elaborate landing platform on the chromosome, where Smc\u2013ScpAB initiates with the help of ParB the lengthwise compaction of chromosomes by forming and extruding loops of DNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

A reasonable first step towards understanding the architecture of Smc/ParB/<i>parS</i> assemblies might be the investigation of physical interactions between ParB/<i>parS</i> and Smc\u2013ScpAB and their functional interconnection with the Smc ATPase cycle. In the future, Smc/ParB/<i>parS</i> structures could serve as a relatively simple paradigm for chromosome organization by the more intricately regulated cohesin and condensin complexes in eukaryotes."

In contrast, Smc functionality and its loading onto DNA in vivo is critically dependent on the ScpB subunit and the ATPase cycle. It remains unclear though what the exact role of ScpB and ATP hydrolysis in the entrapment of DNA might be. If loading indeed depends on transient opening of a DNA entry gate, the open state would likely represent an energetically unfavorable reaction intermediate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Timely opening would require energy input as well as tight regulation. We have recently demonstrated that the ATP dependent engagement of Smc head domains\u2014together with DNA binding to the Smc hinge domain\u2014can transform the configuration of the Smc coiled coil from a rod to a more open ring-like conformation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Soh et al., 2015</a>). Hydrolysis of ATP and/or ScpB binding could drive a subsequent conformational change that might open the SMC\u2013kleisin ring (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Alternatively, ScpB and/or ATP hydrolysis might stabilize Smc\u2013ScpAB once loaded onto DNA or promote Smc's sliding along DNA to allow efficient extrusion of DNA loops by the Smc\u2013ScpAB ring (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

In addition to this loading defect, also the specific recruitment of Smc\u2013ScpAB towards the replication origin is lost in the absence of ParB (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gruber and Errington, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sullivan et al., 2009</a>). Thus, in <i>parB</i> mutants only a very small proportion of cellular Smc\u2013ScpAB is bound to chromosomes within the replication origin region, where it presumably performs its essential function by promoting the separation of nascent sister chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gruber et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Nevertheless, defects in chromosome segregation are rather mild in <i>parB</i> mutants when compared to mutants of <i>smc</i>. Using quantitative blotting of Smc protein and replication origin DNA from cell extracts, we have estimated the average number of Smc protein to be around 30 dimers per replication origin in a fast growing population of cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Assuming that all Smc complexes entrap chromosomal DNA in wild-type cells, only three to six Smc dimers (10\u201320% of total) are loaded onto the chromosome in <i>parB</i> mutants according to our measurements. Thus, a handful of Smc\u2013ScpAB complexes, which are presumably randomly distributed over the chromosome, appears to be capable of supporting near-normal chromosome segregation under these conditions\u2014when chromosome segregation is already compromised by the loss of the <i>parABS</i> system. Few Smc\u2013ScpAB therefore seem to be able to provide enough organization to the replication origin region and the remainder of the chromosome to prevent lethal accumulation of inter-linked sister chromosomes. It is conceivable that individual Smc\u2013ScpAB complexes are able to organize large chunks of a bacterial chromosome, possible by forming giant loops of DNA. Alternatively, Smc activity might be needed only at a limited number of defined locations on the <i>B. subtilis</i> chromosome and/or for very short periods of time. However, when levels of functional Smc dimers are in addition reduced for example by hypomorphic mutations in the <i>smc</i> gene itself, the loss of ParB protein becomes lethal (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gruber and Errington, 2009</a>)."

Wild-type Smc protein was expressed and purified as described in (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fuentes-Perez et al., 2012</a>) with an additional Superose 6 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) gel filtration added as a final step in the purification. Gel filtration was performed in storage buffer 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. The concentration of purified untagged Smc protein was determined by measuring the absorption of the protein at 280 nm in 6 M guanidine chloride (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grimsley and Pace, 2004</a>). An extinction coefficient (51,230 M<sup>\u22121</sup> cm<sup>\u22121</sup> at 280 nm) for the <i>B. subtilis</i> Smc protein was obtained using the ProtParam tool at <a href=\"http://www.expasy.org\">www.expasy.org</a>."
