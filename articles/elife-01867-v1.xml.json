We used magnetoencephalography recordings of spontaneous activity to characterize whole-brain functional connectivity dynamics at high temporal resolution. Using a novel approach that identifies the points in time at which unique patterns of activity recur, we reveal transient (100\u2013200 ms) brain states with spatial topographies similar to those of well-known resting state networks. By assessing temporal changes in the occurrence of these states, we demonstrate that within-network functional connectivity is underpinned by coordinated neuronal dynamics that fluctuate much more rapidly than has previously been shown. We further evaluate cross-network interactions, and show that anticorrelation between the default mode network and parietal regions of the dorsal attention network is consistent with an inability of the system to transition directly between two transient brain states."

We used magnetoencephalography recordings of spontaneous activity to characterize whole-brain functional connectivity dynamics at high temporal resolution. Using a novel approach that identifies the points in time at which unique patterns of activity recur, we reveal transient (100\u2013200 ms) brain states with spatial topographies similar to those of well-known resting state networks. By assessing temporal changes in the occurrence of these states, we demonstrate that within-network functional connectivity is underpinned by coordinated neuronal dynamics that fluctuate much more rapidly than has previously been shown. We further evaluate cross-network interactions, and show that anticorrelation between the default mode network and parietal regions of the dorsal attention network is consistent with an inability of the system to transition directly between two transient brain states."

Since changes in blood oxygen occur relatively slowly, the ability of fMRI to detect rapid changes in activity is limited: it is thus possible that the long-lived nature of resting state networks is an artefact of the use of fMRI."

These so-called resting state networks (RSNs) have been consistently identified across different subjects in the absence of any explicit task from covariations in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beckmann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Smith et al., 2009</a>).

This is in part due to the fact that the indirect hemodynamic response measured via the BOLD signal precludes studying the rich temporal dynamics of the underlying electrophysiological activity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Logothetis, 2008</a>). In contrast, non-invasive electrophysiological recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide a direct measure of neuronal activity at high temporal resolution. Recent studies using these modalities have revealed that these networks have an electrophysiological basis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Laufs et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">He et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brookes et al., 2011</a>), and are underpinned by much richer spatiotemporal dynamics that may be better characterized using time-varying measures of interactions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brookes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hutchison et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">de Pasquale et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2012</a>). These studies have shown evidence that functional connectivity within whole brain networks exhibit temporal variability on a time scale of seconds to tens of seconds. However, to provide an effective substrate for cognitive processes, functional networks should be able to rapidly reorganize and coordinate on a sub-second temporal scale (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bressler and Tognoli, 2006</a>)."

This may provide a more meaningful metric since a sufficient amount of data is required for reliable estimation of the covariance matrix. Increasing the number of states also has an effect on the mean life times of the inferred states. Varying the number of states from 4 to 15 results in mean lifetimes decreasing from 230 ms to 140 ms (<b>C</b>).

To confirm that these brain states are consistent with coordinated fluctuations at these rapid time scales, we performed a follow up analysis using the inferred state time courses. We reasoned that if there were coordinated fluctuations at the fastest time scales in the state time course, then low pass filtered versions of the state time courses should do worse at explaining fluctuations in the data. Different low pass filtered versions of the state time courses were obtained by computing fractional occupancy time courses using a range of time windows from 0.1 to 8 s. Note that for the shortest time windows, the fractional occupancy time course approximates the state time course. These fractional occupancy time courses were then separately regressed onto the amplitude envelope time course from a representative voxel of the corresponding brain state (the voxel that most correlated with the state time course). This analysis reveals a peak in correlation for window widths between 200 ms and 400 ms, demonstrating that when using the fractional occupancy the fastest time scales at which we can detect fluctuations in the amplitude envelopes are slower than those suggested by the HMM state life-times (\u223c100 ms), but still much faster than has been previously shown (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

The life times of these states were longer, at around 1 s, reflecting the slower time scales of these low pass filtered signals. Next, to test whether simply introducing high frequency noise could result in shorter life times, band-limited Gaussian noise (low pass filtered below 10 Hz, reflecting the spectral content of the original envelopes, and therefore with the same non-independence properties between time points), were added to the envelopes prior to inferring the HMM. As before, states with spatial topographies similar to the original HMM states were identified (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

To assess the relationship between different functional networks in the context of the HMM, we examined the relationship between the points in time at which different states are active. An important result from fMRI studies is the observation that the DMN exhibits anticorrelation with networks associated with attention demanding tasks, such as the dorsal attention network (DAN) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fox et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Smith et al., 2009</a>). Of particular interest therefore is the relationship between state 1, which represents the DMN, and state 7, which we postulate may represent parietal regions of the DAN. While the correspondence between BOLD and electrophysiological activity has yet to be fully understood, it has been shown that alpha and beta power at rest correlate positively with BOLD in the DMN and negatively with BOLD in the DAN (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mantini et al., 2007</a>). Accordingly, increased activity in the DMN (red/yellow in state 1) and decreased activity in parietal regions of the DAN (blue in state 7) would both correspond to an increase in the BOLD signal. Based on this reasoning, we hypothesized that the antagonistic behavior of these two networks as shown in multiple fMRI studies would manifest in the inferred HMM states as an anticorrelation between the fractional occupancy time courses of these two states. In other words, periods of time in which the DMN state is frequently visited would coincide with periods of time in which the putative DAN state is rarely visited (and vice versa)."

To investigate whether any relationship exists between temporal variability in amplitude correlation and the occurrence of states inferred from the HMM, we computed the sliding window envelope correlation between different nodes of the DMN and compared the resulting correlation time courses with changes in the fractional occupancy of the inferred DMN state. Regions of interest were defined in the centers of the nodes corresponding to the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) in both hemispheres (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The envelope of oscillatory activity was computed at these six locations for each subject. With reference to previous findings (<a href=\"#bib38\">de Pasquale et al., 2010</a>), envelope correlation was computed within 10-s sliding windows between all six ipsilateral ROI pairs and all three contralateral ROI pairs. The HMM state corresponding to the DMN was identified and the fractional occupancy was computed within the same 10-s sliding window. The time courses of these two measures are shown for a single subject in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, where the DMN pair shown is the right IPL and right MFG. In line with previous findings, it is evident that the envelope correlation between different network nodes alternates between periods of high and low correlation (<a href=\"#bib38\">de Pasquale et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, periods of high envelope correlation are generally associated with an increase in the fractional occupancy of the DMN state, suggesting that fluctuations in interregional functional connectivity represent periods of time in which a particular transient network is frequently visited. This relationship may be quantified as the correlation between the two time series for each subject and node pair. There is a clear positive correlation between the two measures for all inter- and intra-hemispheric pairs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

However, these relatively weak assumptions render the hypothetical networks unidentifiable using existing decomposition techniques (to the best of our knowledge), and so further constraints are currently needed to proceed. For example, in temporal ICA the assumption of temporal independence will discourage temporal overlap. In the HMM, the mutual exclusion approach will also prohibit temporal overlap. As a result, the HMM states can perhaps be best thought of as representing the most dominant unique configurations of these hypothetical networks. Based on this interpretation, the state time courses provide a meaningful window on the underlying network dynamics by indicating the most dominant state at each point in time. Indeed, we have shown that these time courses can provide an insight into the relationship between different functional networks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

The spatial correspondence between the spatial maps obtained via the HMM and RSNs derived from application of ICA to BOLD are shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. A notable difference between these maps is the absence of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) or precuneus in the DMN state. One possible explanation is that the PCC may act as a functional \u2018hub\u2019, such that it is not strongly represented in any one state. While the HMM allows spatial overlap, we have visualized the states in terms of state-specific amplitude changes, such that any node that is active during a number of states will be suppressed in the spatial maps. It is possible that, as a hub, the PCC has membership in the majority of states and is therefore poorly identified by mapping state specific activity. However, it is not trivial to identify nodes that are active in multiple states because this is confounded by the spatial leakage due to the ambiguities in the source reconstruction (<a href=\"#bib53\">Van Veen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schoffelen and Gross, 2009</a>)."

Graph theoretical analyses of MEG band-limited power have revealed strong hubs in dorsal prefrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and temporal cortex (in essence those areas represented by state 1), but notably not the PCC (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hipp et al., 2012</a>).

The particular form of such networks is tied to the approaches used to identify them, for example spatial ICA. Indeed when other approaches with different assumptions are made, then different networks can be inferred. One good example of this is that, when using temporal ICA on fMRI data, no single DMN is found (<a href=\"#bib50\">Smith et al., 2012</a>). In short, the concept of a \u2018network\u2019 and the form they take depends on the assumptions made in the data decomposition approach, and none should be considered necessarily better than the other (assuming they show similar objective performance, e.g., Bayesian model evidence and reproducibility), but instead they each offer different perspectives on the nature of the brain\u2019s activity."

Microstates are quasi-stable topographies in which the distribution of EEG power over the scalp remains stable for periods of around 100 ms. Clustering of these topographies into a limited number of classes has revealed that relatively few (typically four) unique maps are consistently identified across multiple time points and subjects (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lehmann et al., 1998</a>). It has also been suggested that EEG microstates may represent the electrophysiological signatures of resting state networks. A number of recent studies have sought to investigate this by correlating fMRI RSNs with simultaneously acquired EEG recordings (<a href=\"#bib5\">Britz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Musso et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>)."

However, a clear distinction is that the HMM explicitly models the temporal dynamics and is therefore tuned to finding states that repeat in a predictable way. Another difference is that our approach exploits the superior spatial resolution available using MEG, by basing the inferred states on source space projections of MEG data. This makes results more directly interpretable in the context of fMRI resting state networks. While it is possible that the HMM states inferred in this paper relate to the source space counterparts of EEG microstates, without measuring EEG and MEG concurrently, a direct relationship cannot be confirmed."

In both the ICA and HMM approaches, data from all voxels are used and therefore no prior spatial localization assumptions (e.g., seed voxels) are required. In the case of temporal ICA, two regions will tend to be strongly represented in the same network if their time courses exhibit a strong time-averaged correlation with the same independent component. By contrast, in the case of the HMM, membership of two regions to a particular state (\u2018network\u2019) depends only on there being a repeated pattern of covariance at those points in time at which the state is active, that is, it is not time averaged over \u2018all\u2019 time points. The results in this paper, for example the fact that the two approaches result in similar networks, are consistent with the idea that ICA RSNs derive from the transient time-varying behavior captured by the HMM states. This idea is supported by the findings that seed-based functional connectivity is increased if evaluated only within those time points at which the rest of the network is synchronized (<a href=\"#bib38\">de Pasquale et al., 2010</a>). In this paper, we provide evidence of a relationship between the sliding window correlation computed between nodes of the DMN and the occurrence rate of the DMN state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Accordingly, changes in within-network envelope correlation may reflect variations in the frequency at which a particular connectivity state is visited. One explanation for this observation is the idea that electrophysiological data are characterized by scale-free dynamics that span from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds (<a href=\"#bib54\">Van de Ville et al., 2010</a>). This fractal property of neural dynamics may provide an explanation for the similar spatial correlation structure that exists between signals at different temporal scales. Hence, slow fluctuations in band-limited amplitude correlations that underlie MEG RSNs may capture similar physiological phenomena as the HMM states, but seen through different temporal filters."

Group concatenation is widely used in unsupervised analyses of resting state activity, particularly in the case of ICA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Calhoun et al., 2009</a>). Nonetheless, it is important to bear in mind that this approach assumes that there is an anatomical correspondence between subjects. In the case of ICA, this assumption means that individuals share common group maps (<a href=\"#bib10\">Calhoun et al., 2009</a>). In the case of the HMM approach, this assumption extends to the requirement that the data from different individuals within a particular state are drawn from the same multivariate normal distribution, and that the transitions between these states occur in a repeatable manner over subjects. This being said, there is no requirement that all states should be present in all subjects, however it is clear from the fractional occupancy time courses in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> that they are. In light of this assumption, states inferred from the group data may best be thought of as representing the spatiotemporal patterns of activity that occur most consistently over the group. An alternative strategy to group concatenation is to infer separate HMMs for each subject individually. This would allow the model to more freely adapt to individual subjects\u2019 patterns of activity and functional connectivity. However, a severe limitation of this approach is that there will not necessarily be a correspondence between states inferred from different subjects, making it difficult to perform subsequent analyses at the group level."

Bayesian inference techniques provide a means to test model order selection, by providing an approximation to the model evidence via the free energy. In theory, it should be possible to pick the optimal number of states by selecting the model with the greatest (negative) free energy. In practice however, we observe that the free energy increases monotonically up to K = 15 states, suggesting that the Bayes-optimal model may require an even higher number of states (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In the absence of a straightforward data driven approach to model order selection, we opted instead to repeat the analysis for values of K from 4 to 15 and arbitrarily chose 8 states as the case to present here, which we believe represents a good trade-off between richness and redundancy. Results for different model orders are shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Varying the number of states between 4 and 14 did not change the topographies of the most prominent RSN-like states. It is worth noting that a similar limitation exists for more established data-driven decompositions such as ICA, in which the choice of model order is driven by the application; for example, lower model orders are used to obtain the classic RSNs, and higher model orders are used to obtain finer grained parcellations for use in subsequent network analysis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Smith et al., 2011</a>)."

The assumption of a Gaussian observation model allows inference of the HMM to be made tractable to variational Bayesian inference and thus permits its application to large amounts of data (40 observations and 1.5 hr of time points). However, it should be recognized that modeling only the first and second order statistics under a Gaussian assumption is likely to be an oversimplification of the underlying network dynamics. The multivariate normal distribution is just one of many potential observation models that may be used in the context of the HMM. For example, binary observation models have previously been used in the context of modeling interictal spikes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ossadtchi et al., 2005</a>). Future work will focus on implementing a multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model that can model time lagged dependencies between observations."

However, this means that the multivariate normal distributions that define each state span this reduced subspace, and are therefore not readily interpretable in terms of the underlying anatomy. To interrogate those brain areas associated with each state, we mapped state-specific activity by correlating the amplitude envelope at each voxel with the HMM state time courses. This has the advantage of identifying only activity that is unique to each state, and thus reduces components of the signal that are common across states that may obscure state-specific effects."

Specifically, we perform a multiple linear regression at each voxel with the group-concatenated envelope data as the dependent variable. To compute the partial correlation, both the design matrix and the data were normalized to have zero mean and unit variance prior to fitting the GLM.

Since each extracted state was multivariate normal, the HMM technique as applied here might be detecting the most-stationary epochs in resting MEG data, which would suggest that rather than detecting networks, it is detecting epochs during which minimal oscillatory (i.e., network) activity is present in a given region. One simple means to assess this would be to describe the characteristic frequency of each of the 8 detected states using e.g., a Fourier transformation at the center of mass for each network as presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. If this would constitute too much additional work, the authors should provide a substantial and well-referenced limitations section. Given that HMM is also an effective method of spike detection in M/EEG data (Ossadtchi, Mosher, Sutherling, Greenblatt, &amp; Leahy, 2005) the authors should describe in detail the methodological differences between HMM for spike detection and HMM as used in the present study."

Furthermore, the issue of anti-correlation between DMN and DAN should not be over-emphasized given that even in fMRI there are significant questions with regard to their biological significance."

An alternative would be to project the observation model means and covariance matrices using the eigenvectors derived from the original PCA.

So in this regard there is no reason why a hub, such as the PCC, should not be represented.
