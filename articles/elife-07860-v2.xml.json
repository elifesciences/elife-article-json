Here we investigate genomic imprinting in the cerebellum using a newly developed Bayesian statistical model that provides unprecedented transcript-level resolution. We uncover 160 imprinted transcripts, including 41 novel and independently validated imprinted genes. Strikingly, many genes exhibit parentally biased\u2014rather than monoallelic\u2014expression, with different magnitudes according to age, organ, and brain region. Developmental changes in parental bias and overall gene expression are strongly correlated, suggesting combined roles in regulating gene dosage. Finally, brain-specific deletion of the paternal, but not maternal, allele of the paternally-biased <i>Bcl-x,</i> (<i>Bcl2l1</i>) results in loss of specific neuron types, supporting the functional significance of parental biases. These findings reveal the remarkable complexity of genomic imprinting, with important implications for understanding the normal and diseased brain."

Here we investigate genomic imprinting in the cerebellum using a newly developed Bayesian statistical model that provides unprecedented transcript-level resolution. We uncover 160 imprinted transcripts, including 41 novel and independently validated imprinted genes. Strikingly, many genes exhibit parentally biased\u2014rather than monoallelic\u2014expression, with different magnitudes according to age, organ, and brain region. Developmental changes in parental bias and overall gene expression are strongly correlated, suggesting combined roles in regulating gene dosage. Finally, brain-specific deletion of the paternal, but not maternal, allele of the paternally-biased <i>Bcl-x,</i> (<i>Bcl2l1</i>) results in loss of specific neuron types, supporting the functional significance of parental biases. These findings reveal the remarkable complexity of genomic imprinting, with important implications for understanding the normal and diseased brain."

The degree of imprinting varied between genes. In some genes only one copy was expressed and the other was completely silenced whereas others only deviated from the two copies being expressed equally. For individual genes, imprinting varied with age, tending to be more pronounced in young animals than in adults. It also varied between brain regions and typically genes were imprinted more in the brain compared to elsewhere in the body."

Although expression differences between parental alleles are commonly assumed to be all-to-none, a substantial number of imprinted genes have been shown to exhibit a biased expression from one of the parental alleles in at least some tissues (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dao et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Lewis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Khatib, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Babak et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Menheniott et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tierling et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gregg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Gregg, 2014</a>). Imprinted genes have been shown to play key roles during embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cleaton et al., 2014</a>), in the placenta (<a href=\"#bib94\">Tunster et al., 2013</a>), and more recently, in the developing and adult brain (<a href=\"#bib105\">Wilkinson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Keverne, 2012</a>). A systematic survey of the expression patterns of known imprinted genes in the brain indicates a preferential enrichment of imprinted gene expression in a subset of brain areas, in particular those involved in feeding, social, and motivated behaviors (<a href=\"#bib35\">Gregg et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, the prominent role of imprinted genes in brain development and function is evidenced by a number of human disorders and mouse mutant phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib105\">Wilkinson et al., 2007</a>). For instance, patients with Prader\u2013Willi syndrome, caused by loss of paternal expression in the q11-13 region of human chromosome 15, display abnormal development, hyperphagia, mental retardation, and volatile behavior (<a href=\"#bib67\">Peters, 2014</a>). In contrast, Angelman syndrome, which is caused by loss of maternal expression in the same genomic region, results in mental retardation, impaired speech, and an abnormally joyful demeanor (<a href=\"#bib67\">Peters, 2014</a>). Similarly, Birk-Barel mental retardation syndrome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barel et al., 2008</a>) is caused by mutations in the human maternally expressed <i>KCNK9</i> gene, and phenotypes associated with loss of the imprinted genes <i>Grb10</i>, <i>Mest</i>, and <i>Peg3</i> in the mouse exhibit impairments in specific social behaviors (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lefebvre et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Li et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Isles et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Garfield et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "A key feature of genomic imprinting lies in the transmission of epigenetic marks that remain stable across cell divisions throughout the lifespan of the organism and in different tissues. Surprisingly, subsets of genes have been reported to exhibit tissue-specific imprinting, and the whole brain, neurons and certain brain regions emerged as hot spots for such regulation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albrecht et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gregg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sato and Stryker, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Prickett and Oakey, 2012</a>). A genome-wide identification of allelic parental bias throughout the adult and developing brain appears therefore necessary to fully assess the role of genomic imprinting in the nervous system. Such a quest has been noticeably difficult to achieve. Initial methods to uncover imprinted genes based on the differential expression between parthenogenetic (containing only maternally derived chromosomes) and androgenetic (containing only paternally derived chromosomes) embryos, and subsequent discovery of adjacent imprinted loci within the genome were mainly focused on early developmental stages, and led to the identification of approximately 100 imprinted genes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kaneko-Ishino et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hagiwara et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Morison et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Ruf et al., 2006</a>). The development of next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) allowed for genome-wide screens of parentally biased allelic expression in any tissue of interest using F1s of reciprocal crosses between distantly related mouse strains. An intriguing question was whether or not this new, and presumably more powerful, experimental strategy would uncover novel imprinted genes. The answer to this question was proven challenging and controversial. In pioneer RNA-seq analyses of mouse hybrids, <a href=\"#bib103\">Wang et al. (2008)</a> and <a href=\"#bib4\">Babak et al. (2008)</a> used neonatal brains and E9.5 embryos, respectively, and determined parental biases by testing if the sum of parentally phased reads along a gene significantly deviates from biallelic expression. This approach, combined with shallow sequencing, only identified a handful of novel imprinted genes and failed to detect genes known to be imprinted in the profiled tissues. Next, <a href=\"#bib35\">Gregg et al. (2010)</a> conducted an imprinting study at higher resolution by characterizing the preoptic area and prefrontal cortex of adult males and females, and the E15 brain, with an over 10-fold higher sequencing depth compared to the two previous studies. This experimental design, combined with testing for deviation from biallelic expression of parentally phased reads at each single SNP rather than along an entire gene, resulted with a much larger number of novel imprinted gene candidates. However, most of the novel imprinted candidates were not subject to independent experimental validation. In turn, <a href=\"#bib22\">DeVeale et al. (2012)</a> criticized the use of single SNPs to infer imprinting and the lack of systematic independent validation of <a href=\"#bib35\">Gregg et al. (2010)</a> as leading to a large and underestimated false discovery rate, and suggested that the vast majority of imprinted genes in mouse were likely already uncovered (<a href=\"#bib22\">DeVeale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48a\">Kelsey and Bartolomei, 2012</a>)."

We further build upon these methodological and experimental advances to gain insights into the spatial and developmental dynamics of parent-of-origin allelic expression. From our study, the apoptotic pathway emerges as an important target of imprinting regulation, and we provide evidence that the paternal and maternal alleles of <i>Bcl-x</i> (<i>Bcl2l1</i>) contribute unequally to brain development. These findings open exciting new avenues for investigating epigenetic mechanisms underlying the normal and pathological brain."

Thus, accurate transcriptional analysis requires estimating the expression level of each transcript rather than quantifying expression at the gene level. In turn, quantification at the transcript level is also necessary to accurately estimate the expression of a given gene, which is merely the sum of all its isoforms (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jiang and Wong, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Turro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Trapnell et al., 2013</a>). However, since a large fraction of reads do not map uniquely to a single transcript (e.g., reads originating from constitutive exons) or even to unique genomic locations, transcript- and gene-expression levels can only be estimated with some degree of certainty, that is, with estimation error (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jiang and Wong, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Turro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Trapnell et al., 2013</a>). The uncertainty in estimating transcript- and gene-expression levels is even more pronounced when quantifying allele-specific expression, because the high sequence similarity between the two alleles results in a high level of read-mapping ambiguity. An additional concern arises from the mapping of RNA-seq hybrid data to the mouse C57Bl/6J reference genome, as it will favor the mapping of reads originating from the C57Bl/6J allele, and may therefore lead to inaccurate estimates of allele-specific expression levels (<a href=\"#bib98\">Vijaya Satya et al., 2012</a>). Finally, accurate inference of genomic imprinting requires a statistical model that explicitly accounts for expression-level uncertainty in each sample, together with the biological and technical variability, and the effects of all factors in the experimental design, such as sex, age, and, in the case of mouse hybrids, the cross of each sequenced subject."

First, we generated Cast/EiJ and C57Bl/6J diploid genomes and transcriptomes by incorporating Cast/EiJ and C57Bl/6J single nucleotide- and short insertion and deletion polymorphisms (SNPs and indels, obtained from the Mouse Genome Project: <a href=\"ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/REL-1303-SNPs_Indels-GRCm38\">ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/REL-1303-SNPs_Indels-GRCm38</a>) into the <i>Mus musculus</i> GRCm38 reference genome sequence using the AlleleSeq package (<a href=\"#bib80\">Rozowsky et al., 2011</a>). We then mapped each of the Cast/EiJ\u00d7C57Bl/6J hybrid RNA-seq libraries to the splice-junction aware diploid genome using STAR RNA-seq aligner (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dobin et al., 2013</a>). For each mapped RNA-seq library, we then estimated the expression level of each transcript with its respective error, for each allele in a Cast/EiJ\u00d7C57Bl/6J diploid transcriptome using MMSEQ (<a href=\"#bib96\">Turro et al., 2011</a>). Finally, we developed a statistical model testing for genomic imprinting at the level of each transcript, while taking into account the effects of cross, sex, and age across all samples. Specifically, we developed a BRAIM which is a Bayesian variable selection regression model extending <a href=\"#bib15\">Chipman et al. (1997)</a> by accounting for the measurement error in the response (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In our settings, we define the response as the difference between the paternal and the maternal expression levels for a given transcript in each sample in the experiment, that is, the parental bias. The model therefore computes a posterior distribution of the magnitude of the parental bias, and of the effects that all factors have on the parental bias, along with their marginal posterior probabilities (PPs) of being significantly different from zero."

                                "text": "Our approach readily estimates parental bias at the transcript level, as seen in the allelic analysis of the 11 expressed isoforms of the imprinted gene <i>Rian</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hatada et al., 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Our data suggest that most imprinted genes, including <i>Rian</i>, show a consistent imprinting pattern in all isoforms. However, isoform-specific imprinting is readily identified by our approach, and can be seen in two different genomic contexts. A few genes harboring a paternally expressed gene inserted within an intron (often a retrogene) have been shown to generate different isoforms from the maternal and paternal alleles (<a href=\"#bib106\">Wood et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gregg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cowley et al., 2012</a>). Although it is unclear exactly how such regulation arises, transcriptional interference by the intronic paternally expressed gene may play an important role (<a href=\"#bib60\">McCole and Oakey, 2008</a>). Our analysis readily identified previously reported cases of genes in which isoforms are subject to such regulation (e.g., the <i>H13</i>-<i>Mcts2</i> locus, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Moreover, it detected additional imprinted transcripts in the <i>Herc3</i> gene- either or both of two short transcripts (indistinguishable by our sequence data) from a promoter upstream to the large 25 exons-long transcript (Gencode transcript IDs: ENSMUST00000141600.1 and ENSMUST00000122981.1), which are preferentially expressed by the maternal allele (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Other known cases of isoform-specific imprinting are due to differential methylation of alternative promoters (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arnaud et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Choi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Peters and Williamson, 2007</a>). Interestingly, we detect a novel maternally expressed short transcript (791 bp) (Gencode transcript ID: ENSMUST00000149496.1) at the locus of the paternally expressed <i>Mest</i> gene, whose transcription starts at exon 9, suggesting alternative promoter usage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This transcript is presumably a non-coding RNA since no open reading frame could be identified. In total, we detected 8 of the 10 known cases of isoform-specific imprinting (the missing two cases are the short isoform of <i>Cdh15</i>, which is not expressed in the cerebellum, and the long isoform of <i>Blcap</i>, which is not heterozygous in the Cast/EiJ\u00d7C57Bl/6J hybrids), and we uncovered additional imprinted isoforms, including a novel example of isoform-specific imprinting in the <i>Mest</i> locus.

Our analysis shows that the age effects on the magnitude of the parental bias and on the overall expression are positively correlated, such that both the magnitude of the parental bias and the overall expression level of imprinted genes tend to increase or decrease together with age (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.33; p-value = 4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Since the ability to accurately detect and estimate parental biases is limited at low expression levels, we repeated this analysis with a higher expression level threshold (right to the dashed line in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) but found no significant effect on our results. The relationship between parental bias and overall expression identified in our analysis may result from the fact that the two parental alleles experience differential transcriptional regulation during development, thereby altering both the magnitude of the parental bias as well as the overall level of expression. To test this hypothesis we fitted our model to the data where we defined the response as either the paternal or the maternal expression level. This analysis reveals that age regulated expression or parental bias (age effect PP &gt; 0.95) is achieved either by a significant change in the expression level only of the most highly expressed (preferred) parental allele (PA; 19 genes, aligned along the X-axis in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), a significant change in the expression level only of the non-preferred allele (8 genes, aligned along the Y-axis in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), or a significant change in the expression levels of both alleles (12 genes, aligned along the diagonal in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Finally, some genes have a significant change in expression and/or parental bias only when both alleles are combined but not when the alleles are analyzed separately (11 genes, scattered around the origin of axes in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Thus, our data suggest that altering the expression level of the preferred allele is the most common mode through which imprinted genes are regulated according to age (p-value = 0.03; <i>\u03c7</i><sup>2</sup> test), and this allelic regulation changes both the parental bias as well as the overall expression level. It is also possible that the enhanced expression and parental bias observed in the P8 cerebellum originates from different cellular compositions of the developing and adult cerebellum. These scenarios are not mutually exclusive."

The remaining 9 genes (8%) are isolated from other known or newly identified imprinted genes. Moreover, although most newly identified imprinted genes from this study are located within or around known imprinted clusters, 7 of the 41 (17%) appear isolated in the genome (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). We noticed that a substantial number of imprinted genes displaying weak to moderate parental bias localize to the vicinity of imprinted genes showing stronger parental bias (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). For example, <i>Ankrd34c</i> and <i>Ctsh</i>, two genes that exhibit a weak paternal bias (note: the parental bias of <i>Ankrd34c</i> is significant according to the pyrosequencing data only), are located up- and downstream to <i>Rasgrf1</i>, a gene exclusively expressed from the paternal allele (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This observation led us to explore whether parental bias consistently decays as a function of the distance from strongly biased genes. We first defined imprinted cluster centers as genes for which the parental bias of the preferentially expressed allele reaches at least 85%, and subsequently assigned adjacent imprinted genes with an intergenic distance of up to 1 MB as members of the same cluster (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This step partitioned the imprinted genes in our data to a total of 24 imprinted clusters. Analysis of the magnitude of the parental bias as a function of the distance to the cluster center reveals a statistically significant negative effect (p-value = 1.08 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), supporting a model of decay of parental bias from imprinted cluster centers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Importantly, not all of the imprinted clusters follow these patterns. For instance, the developmentally regulated imprinted cluster on chromosome 1 (described above and in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) does not contain any strongly imprinted gene that could be categorized as a cluster center, nor does it exhibit a decay in the parental bias of adjacent genes."

Alternatively, if imprinting regulation of genes with weak-to-moderate parental bias is not functionally important, and simply reflects the indirect byproduct of regulation of adjacent genes, the micro-synteny of these genes is not expected to be strongly conserved across mammalian genomes. To test these hypotheses, we derived all pairs of adjacent genes in the mouse genome with orthologs in at least one of 15 other mammalian genomes (409,874 gene pairs) and estimated the tendency of their mammalian orthologs to be adjacent as well (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>, and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), using a probabilistic phylogenetic model analyzing phyletic patterns of presence and absence (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen et al., 2008</a>). This analysis reveals that the mean propensity of adjacency of mammalian orthologs of weakly imprinted gene pairs in the mouse (parental biases below 85%) is significantly higher than the mean propensity of adjacency of orthologs of all mouse adjacent gene pairs (p-value = 0.007, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). These findings suggest that the micro-synteny of imprinted clusters is evolutionary conserved, thus supporting the idea that the imprinting regulation of mouse genes with weak-to-moderate parental biases is functionally important. This also suggests that the orthologs of many of these genes may be imprinted in other mammalian species."

Previous studies have reported a differential methylation between the two parental alleles for some of these genes. For example, differential methylation was observed in a region of chromosome 13 immediately downstream of <i>Nhlrc1</i> (<a href=\"#bib107\">Xie et al., 2012</a>), a novel paternally-biased gene in our results (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In humans, mutations in <i>Nhlrc1</i> cause Lafora progressive myoclonic epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib75\">Rom\u00e1-Mateo et al., 2012</a>), a fatal neurological disorder characterized by the presence of massive intracellular inclusions observed in several neuronal cell types across the brain including the cerebellar granule cells. Differential methylation but not parentally biased expression in the brain was also reported within the Actinin alpha 1 (<i>Actn1</i>) gene at chromosome 12 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Calaway and Dom\u00ednguez, 2012</a>), which codes for a protein that regulates cytoskeleton interactions with the membrane. Our results show that this gene is indeed preferentially expressed from the paternal allele in the cerebellum. We also uncovered the paternal-specific expression of the <i>Fkbp6</i> gene, which is isolated on distal chromosome 5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Interestingly, this gene displays maternal allele-specific binding of ZFP57, a DNA-binding protein that specifically binds to the majority of imprinted genes and protects them from demethylation after fertilization (<a href=\"#bib71\">Quenneville et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "The differences in parental biases observed across the brain raise the question of when during development these specificities are established. To address this issue, we performed a pyrosequencing analysis of the parental biases of 13 genes inferred to be temporally and/or spatially regulated across the brain and in non-brain tissues, at postnatal days 0, 8, 15, and 64 in the cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1I</a>). These three brain regions were selected for developmental analysis because they display contrasting imprinting patterns in the adult. In addition, we analyzed the parental bias of these 13 genes in the entire E15 brain. This analysis revealed substantial spatiotemporal dynamics of the parental bias of several genes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). For instance, <i>Blcap</i> exhibits a gradual decrease in maternal bias over development consistently across the three analyzed brain regions. In contrast, the switch from maternal to paternal bias of <i>Zim1</i> during cerebellum development, occurs gradually along development in both the cerebellum and cortex, yet is not mirrored in the hypothalamus where maternal bias is strongly maintained into adulthood. Moreover, this analysis reveals that the sharp contrast between the parental biases of <i>Igf2</i> and <i>Grb10</i>, observed across the brain, seems to be temporally co-regulated. The switch in the expressed allele for both genes happens earlier in the cortex and hypothalamus than in the cerebellum, which roughly coincides with the completion of their development (<a href=\"#bib55\">Levitt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Shimogori et al., 2010</a>). These results demonstrate that imprinting is a remarkably dynamic process, and suggest that the highly coordinated spatiotemporal regulation of parent-of-origin expression may in turn orchestrate development across different brain regions."

                                "text": "In order to gain initial insights into the functional implications of the observed patterns of parental bias across the brain, we investigated whether specific biological pathways are enriched among cerebellum-imprinted genes. The category of programmed cell death (apoptosis) includes eight genes previously shown to exhibit parent-of-origin monoallelic expression, and five genes that we have newly identified as exhibiting parentally biased expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Our data thus uncover the programmed cell death pathway as a prominent target of imprinting. Noticeably, most of the maternally-biased genes (<i>Cdkn1c</i>, <i>Kcnk9</i>, <i>Blcap</i>, and <i>Bmf</i>) promote apoptosis, while most of the paternally-biased genes (<i>Ndn</i>, <i>Peg3</i>, <i>Peg10</i>, <i>Plagl1</i>, and <i>Magel2</i>) inhibit apoptosis. One gene of particular interest is the paternally-biased <i>Bcl-x</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Gregg et al., 2010</a>), which can produce two distinct protein isoforms: the anti-apoptotic <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> and the pro-apoptotic <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>S</i></sub>, translated from two distinct mRNA transcripts (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boise et al., 1993</a>). <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> is by far the predominant <i>Bcl-x</i> transcript in the brain (<a href=\"#bib51\">Krajewska et al., 2002</a>), where it exhibits widespread paternally-biased expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Also of interest is the gene <i>Bag3</i>, which was newly identified by our study as maternally-biased in the brain and biallelic in peripheral tissues (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The protein products of genes <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> and <i>Bag3</i> have multiple functions, including some unrelated to apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib77\">Roth and D'Sa, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Rosati et al., 2011</a>). However, a suggested function of these proteins, mediated by their mutual interaction, is to prevent the mitochondrial release of factors controlling activation of caspases and thus the irreversible commitment to undergoing apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Jacobs and Marnett, 2009</a>). Our RNA-seq analysis of the cerebellum revealed that the maternal bias of <i>Bag3</i> substantially increases from P8 to P60 whereas <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> shows a substantial decrease in paternal bias between these two time points (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Further quantification of parental biases across 16 regions of the adult brain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) shows that, with the exception of the ventral midbrain and pons, the parental biases of <i>Bag3</i> and <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> are significantly anti-correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient = \u22120.56; p-value = 0.04, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This pattern is most evident in the cortex and cerebellum, as well as in central striatal regions, caudate putamen, and hippocampus. Variation in the parental biases of <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> and <i>Bag3</i> are also observed in our developmental analysis but an anti-correlation between the two is not as apparent (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>)."

Complete knockout of <i>Bcl-x</i> results in massive embryonic apoptosis and lethality, whereas loss of one allele has been reported to reduce brain size by \u223c15% (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kasai et al., 2003</a>). We hypothesized that if the paternal and maternal alleles unequally contribute to the expression of <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> in the brain, and if this differential parental contribution is of functional significance, the differential loss of each parental allele should result in distinct functional outcomes.

The floxed <i>Bcl-x</i> allele enables CRE-dependent deletion of both the anti-apoptotic <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> and pro-apoptotic <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>S</i></sub> isoforms. However, since <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> is substantially more highly expressed in the brain (<a href=\"#bib51\">Krajewska et al., 2002</a>), the brain-specific deletion of <i>Bcl-x</i> is expected to affect the <i>Bcl-x</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> isoform nearly exclusively. As expected, neither the brain-specific maternal deletion nor paternal deletion of <i>Bcl-x</i> had a significant effect on the body weight of adult mice (week 11\u201312, \u223cP80). However, we found that mice with a paternal <i>Bcl-x</i> deletion had a \u223c15% reduced brain weight compared to wild type (WT) littermate controls, which carried the <i>Nestin::Cre</i> transgene and two WT copies of <i>Bcl-x</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). In contrast, mice with a maternal <i>Bcl-x</i> deletion exhibited no significant difference in brain weight compared to WT littermates. We next asked whether the paternal <i>Bcl-x</i> deletion has observable effects on brain morphology by measuring the cross-sectional area of three different brain structures: cortex, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. In all three structures, significant differences in area were observed between mice with a paternal <i>Bcl-x</i> deletion and both mice with a maternal deletion and WT littermates, while no significant differences were found between mice with a maternal <i>Bcl-x</i> deletion and WT littermates (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>, and <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>).

Similar analyses of the effects of paternal and maternal <i>Bcl-x</i> deletion on lobule 6 of the cerebellum revealed significantly fewer cells in the molecular layer of paternal deletion compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>). Within the molecular and Purkinje layers, <i>Gad1</i>+ neurons were significantly reduced in number in mice with a paternal <i>Bcl-x</i> deletion compared to WT littermates (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2F,G</a>). Together, these results reveal that deletion of the paternal allele of <i>Bcl-x</i> causes dramatic reductions in brain size and cell number that are not observed upon deletion of the maternal allele. Moreover, these effects differ according to cell type and brain region, with specific cell types affected in a given region. They therefore suggest a largely unexpected role of genomic imprinting in the regulation of the distribution of specific cell types in distinct areas of the mouse brain."

This methodological approach allows precise quantification of the entire spectrum of parental biases observed in imprinted genes, and accurately reveals the contribution of each parental allele to the overall gene expression. In addition to 74 imprinted genes that had been previously validated in earlier studies (<a href=\"#bib63\">Morison et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Tunster et al., 2013</a>), our analysis detects 41 novel imprinted genes that we successfully confirmed by pyrosequencing.

Imprinted genes are often described and even defined as mononallelically expressed in a parent-of-origin specific manner. Such definition, however, is incomplete since a substantial number of known imprinted genes appear preferentially expressed from one of the parental alleles. Indeed, the concurrent detection of both mononallelically-expressed and parentally-biased imprinted genes has been highlighted in multiple genome-wide profiles of genomic imprinting (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babak et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gregg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">DeVeale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Zou et al., 2014</a>).

First, the majority of imprinted genes with weak-to-moderate parental bias are located nearby or at known imprinted clusters, and we show that this localization is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting it is under purifying selection. Second, genes like <i>Actn1</i> and <i>Nhlrc1</i>, which exhibit weak parental biases and are isolated in the genome, have been reported to have differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the parental alleles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Calaway and Dom\u00ednguez, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Xie et al., 2012</a>). These DMRs may thus serve as imprinting control regions as has been shown for monoallelically expressed genes. Third, a substantial proportion of genes with weak-to-moderate biases, as well as strongly imprinted genes, show tissue and developmental-stage specificities in their parental biases. For instance, <i>Copg2</i> shows a weak maternal bias in the cerebellum (\u223c60% maternal expression to 40% paternal expression) while its maternal bias in the cortex is close to monoallelic (90% maternal expression to 10% paternal expression). It is therefore possible that many genes with weak-to-moderate parental bias in the cerebellum are actually strongly imprinted in other tissues or developmental stages. Finally, many of the genes with weak-to-moderate biases are implicated in the same biological processes as genes with strong biases, including cell survival and apoptosis."

Postnatal day 8 is an important milestone of cerebellar development that includes a peak of granule cell precursor proliferation, the active migration of granule cells to the inner granule layer, and the establishment of connectivity between mossy fibers, granule cells, and Purkinje cells. Interestingly, most of the regulated genes exhibit stronger parental biases and/or higher overall expression during this time point than in the mature cerebellum.

Our study adds substantial new insights into this phenomenon by investigating the regulation of parental bias of 28 known and novel imprinted genes, across 16 brain regions and 7 somatic non-neural tissues. Three interesting observations emerge from this analysis. First and most noticeably, many genes tested appear uniquely imprinted in the brain. Second, a subset of the genes tested show significant variability in the degree of parental bias across different brain regions. Third, genes within an imprinted cluster, as well as occasional genes located on distinct chromosomes, display interesting similarities in the patterns of paternal bias across brain regions. Additionally, for a subset of imprinted genes, we observed regulation of parental bias according to both the developmental stage and the brain region, suggesting that differences in parental bias observed throughout the adult brain may originate during the lineage specification of distinct brain regions, and may also result from different cellular compositions of the tissues analyzed."

For most imprinted genes, monoallelic or parentally biased expression has been shown to be primarily dependent on DNA methylation marks established in one of the parental germ lines, and maintained post-fertilization in the parental alleles of the embryo and mature organism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith, 2011</a>). In a smaller subset of imprinted genes, the differential methylation of the parental alleles is established in somatic tissues (<a href=\"#bib101\">Wang et al., 2014a</a>). Other genes such as <i>Dlk1</i> and <i>Cdh15</i> become biallelically expressed in specific cell types after gaining DNA methylation on the normally unmethylated allele (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ferr\u00f3n et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Proudhon et al., 2012</a>). Based on these established mechanisms, it is possible that the observed spatial and temporal regulation of parental bias depends on cell-lineage-specific acquisition of DNA methylation or other epigenetic modifications in one of the parental alleles. It is also possible that changes in parental bias result from loss of methylation or perhaps hydroxymethylation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Guo et al., 2011</a>) of DMRs. Alternatively, spatial and temporal variations in parental biases may depend on the presence or absence of chromatin regulators directed by DNA methylation, which in turn control necessary steps to achieve preferential expression of one of the parental alleles (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kulinski et al., 2013</a>), or may rely on the use of brain- and brain region-specific promoter elements. If the parental bias of a certain gene changes according to cell-type, different cellular compositions may also contribute to the observed variability across tissues. This possibility is particularly intriguing in cases where parental biases change according to brain region."

We reasoned that the notion of a significant functional contribution of the observed parental bias to normal brain function and development should be supported by at least three elements: first, the parental bias of a given gene must be evolutionary conserved, second, changes in parental bias of a given gene should be consistent with changes in overall expression level, and third, uniparental deletions should lead to different phenotypes. Our data partially support these three notions. First, although we did not investigate parental biases in other species, the evolutionary conserved micro-synteny of biased genes suggests that natural selection may operate against the disruption of the biased expression. Second, an attractive hypothesis underlying parental allelic biases may lie on the requirement for different brain regions, and possibly neuronal types, to tightly regulate the expression of certain genes for proper cellular or network function. Converging evidence from mental disorders associated with slight over- or under-regulation of certain genes (<a href=\"#bib24\">D\u00f6len et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Ramocki and Zoghbi, 2008</a>) suggests that normal brain function may indeed require precise gene titration. Our study reveals that certain genes undergo striking variations in parental bias from one brain region to the next, or from one developmental stage to the other. For example, <i>Ago2</i> shows a modest 60% maternal bias in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, but a robust \u223c80% maternal expression in the cortex. Similarly, <i>Zim1</i> shows biallelic expression in cortical regions, 85% maternal bias in the pallidum and hypothalamus, and 60% paternal expression in the cerebellum. These data, however, were collected using pyrosequencing, which does not inform on the overall gene expression level, hence such spatial changes in parental biases may, or may not, be associated with up- or down regulation of genes."

Moreover, we find evidence that in the majority of cases, an age-regulated increase in parental bias (age effect PP &gt; 0.95) is accompanied by a significant up-regulation in the expression level of the preferred allele and thus, an increase in parental bias correlates with an increase in overall expression level. This indicates that changes in parental bias and overall expression are coordinated according to development stage and brain region, which may effectively modulate gene dosages in individual cells. In addition, or alternatively, changes in parental biases may arise from different cellular distributions across developmental and adult brain areas. Both scenarios commonly point to a highly dynamic regulation of genomic imprinting according to neuronal types. Finally, the distinct phenotypes observed in mice bearing paternal and maternal deletions of <i>Bcl-x</i> argue strongly that, even for genes displaying weak-to-moderate biases, the two parental alleles may differ in their functional significance."

Accordingly, most of the imprinted apoptosis-related genes observed in our study exhibit stronger overall expression and parental biases in the developing cerebellum than in the adult. We also observe a significant number of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes that are differentially expressed according to brain region. Considering that most neurons in the adult brain are post-mitotic, the functional significance of such spatial regulation is still unclear.

We first downloaded the Gencode (<a href=\"#bib26\">Engstr\u00f6m et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Steijger et al., 2013</a>) M2 mouse main gene annotation (gencode.vM2.annotation) general transfer format (GTF) file and removed from it the following RNA types: Mt_rRNA, Mt_tRNA, miRNA, rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, Mt_tRNA_pseudogene, tRNA_pseudogene, snoRNA_pseudogene, snRNA_pseudogene, scRNA_pseudogene, rRNA_pseudogene, miRNA_pseudogene, as they are not supposed to be enriched in our RNA libraries. In order to include as an extensive set of transcripts as possible and to specifically cover retroposed genes due to their known involvement in genomic imprinting (<a href=\"#bib60\">McCole and Oakey, 2008</a>), we followed these steps to add additional annotated transcripts to gencode.vM2.annotation. First, we downloaded the Gencode Retrotransposed (gencode.vM2.2wayconspseudos) GTF file and the ucscRetroInfo2 mm10 mouse genome assembly retrogenes annotation file from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser (<a href=\"#bib47\">Karolchik et al., 2014</a>). We eliminated any redundancy between the two transcript sets by selecting the longest transcript between any two transcripts represented in both files. Following that, we eliminated any redundancy between that retrogene set and gencode.vM2.annotation transcript set by selecting the longest transcript between any two transcripts represented in both sets. In order to remove any redundancy between our retrogene set and single-exon protein coding transcripts (which is a structural prominent feature of retrogenes) in gencode.vM2.annotation we kept the longest of any intersecting protein-coding single-exon transcript in gencode.vM2.annotation and retrogene in our retrogenes set. Subsequently, we added all transcripts from the UCSC knownGene mm10 mouse genome assembly annotation file, which are not indicated to be represented in the gencode.vM2.annotation set. Finally, we added all functional RNAs from the functional RNA database (fRNAdb, <a href=\"#bib62\">Mituyama et al., 2009</a>), which did not intersect with any of the transcripts in the set we generated in the previous steps and is longer than our 59 bp read length. Altogether, this amounted in 148,120 transcripts from 92,965 genes, comprised of 60,978 protein coding transcripts, 87,142 non-coding transcripts, among which 16,404 are pseudogenes, 15,538 are retrogenes, 2518 are lincRNAs, and the remaining 52,682 are of other miscellaneous types. We then used the UCSC liftOver utility to generate a C57Bl/6J, Cast/EiJ diploid transcriptome set from our generated transcriptome set. We note that many retrogenes are highly redundant in sequence with their paralogs. In the case of short, single-end read RNA-seq data, the accuracy of their expression level estimates would therefore, by and large, be low. For this reason, retrogenes added from the ucscRetroInfo2 retrogenes annotation, which are of lower certainty than retrogenes in the Gencode annotation, are indicated in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A\u2013F</a>."

We then mapped each of our C57Bl/6J\u00d7Cast/EiJ hybrid RNA-seq sequenced libraries to the C57Bl/6J, Cast/EiJ diploid genome and transcriptome splice junctions using STAR RNA-seq aligner (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dobin et al., 2013</a>) allowing a maximum of three mismatches. Specifically, we mapped the data twice where after the first mapping step we incorporated valid splice junctions which were reported by STAR to exist in our RNA-seq data. We note that restricting the number of allowed mismatches to one had no apparent effect on the remaining downstream analyses. Subsequent to the second STAR mapping step we transformed our genomic alignments to transcriptomic alignments and thus filtered any alignments that did not map to our transcript set using custom code. We note that by doing so we allow the reads to unbiasedly align to their best locations in the splice-junction aware genome and subsequently keep our alignments of interest as opposed to aligning the read data directly to the transcriptome (e.g., <a href=\"#bib74\">Roberts and Pachter, 2013</a>). Following that, we estimated the expression levels with their respective uncertainties of each transcript in our C57Bl/6J, Cast/EiJ diploid transcriptome using MMSEQ (<a href=\"#bib96\">Turro et al., 2011</a>). MMSEQ uses a Bayesian model for estimating expression levels and therefore computes a posterior distribution of the expression levels of each transcript in fragment per kilobase per million (FPKM) units. We first transformed these posterior FPKM samples to TPM units as TPM units were shown to be less biased and more interpretable (<a href=\"#bib99\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>). We set the minimum expression TPM cutoff to 0.01. While this is a very low expression level, it still enables to detect genes with parentally biased expression, albeit with lower accuracy, in the estimated fraction of the preferentially expressed allele (see \u2018Results\u2019). In any RNA-seq sample, any transcript for which its MMSEQ posterior median TPM was lower than 0.01 was set to 0.01 (which we thus used as the minimal measureable expression level and therefore avoid taking the logarithm of 0). At a 0.01 TPM expression level cutoff we detect and validate genes with parentally biased expression, although at the very low expression levels the parental biases estimated by RNA-seq strongly deviate from those estimated by pyrosequencing and there is a higher fraction of false positives (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This indicates that the accuracy of parental biases estimated by RNA-seq is limited at this range of low expression levels. Accordingly, the distribution of parental biases at very low expression levels does not follow the bimodal shape of parental biases of genes expressed at higher levels (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We therefore empirically defined a more stringent expression level cutoff corresponding to where the discrepancy between the parental biases estimated by RNA-seq and pyrosequencing drops dramatically (dashed line in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1C</a> and correspondingly in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "Using an extensive transcriptome annotation set has the advantage of estimating the expression levels (and therefore testing for parentally-biased expression) of as many known transcripts that are expressed in the tissue from which RNA was purified, as possible. However, it is very likely that highly similar transcripts (e.g., NAGNAG alternative splice forms, <a href=\"#bib8\">Bradley et al., 2012</a>) will not be distinguishable by the read data. This, in turn, would increase the expression level uncertainties of such lowly identifiable transcripts and would therefore reduce power when testing whether their expression is parentally biased. Ideally, one would detect such lowly identifiable transcripts and combine their expression level estimates into that of a single merged transcript, indicating that either or all of them are expressed. Such combined transcripts would therefore have lower expression level uncertainty than their constituents, which would therefore increase power when testing whether their expression is parentally biased. To achieve this, we adopted the approach of <a href=\"#bib95\">Turro et al. (2014)</a> for combining lowly identifiable transcripts based on the posterior correlation of their expression level estimates, tailored for a diploid transcriptome case. In this approach, for any given RNA-seq sample we compute the Pearson correlation coefficient of the posterior TPM samples of any pair of transcripts from the same locus and the same allele. Subsequently, if the mean Pearson correlation coefficient across all RNA-seq samples for a pair of transcripts in both alleles is lower than a defined cutoff (which we empirically set to \u22120.25), we combine each of these pairs into a single combined transcript. This process continues iteratively until no pair of transcripts (or pairs of already combined transcripts) can be further combined. This consistency between the alleles in the combining process ensures that the resulting combined transcripts are identical for the two alleles and can therefore be tested for parentally biased expression."

Intuitively, if the parental bias is approximately zero across all samples we would conclude that the transcript is not imprinted. The reality of RNA-seq data, however, is more complicated than that. First, as mentioned above, we do not obtain accurate estimates of expression levels but rather estimates with uncertainty. Next, our experimental design may include inherent factors that can affect allele-specific expression levels to various extents, such as the mouse cross, sex, and age. Whether of interest or not, the effects of these factors need to be explicitly accounted for. In addition, even though our nearly genetically identical animal subjects are treated with similar conditions, thereby minimizing effects of any additional factors to the ones specified above (such as environment), we still expect biological variability in RNA levels across our subjects (e.g., due to litter effects). Finally, we would expect technical variability across experiments to add to the biological variability, yet unless addressed explicitly (e.g., sequencing the same RNA library as technical replicates), the two are indistinguishable."

The <i>c</i> parameter acts as a multiplying constant that determines how much higher an important effect has to be relative to a negligible effect in order to be considered significant. The <i>\u03c4</i> parameter allows scaling each effect independently. The shape and scale of the inverse gamma prior distribution of <i>\u03c3</i><sup>2</sup> is determined by <i>\u03bd</i> and <i>\u03bb</i>, respectively (<a href=\"#equ7\">Equation 7</a>).

We chose <i>\u03c4</i> and <i>c</i> of all transcripts to have empirical values of 0.1 and 4.25, respectively, in order to provide a good separation between imprinted and non-imprinted transcripts at the selected PP = 0.95 cutoff. In addition, we set <i>p</i> of all effects to 0.1, reflecting our prior belief of the effects being significant. Although the choice of these hyper-parameter values is arbitrary to some extent, if the model is robust this choice should not affect the ranking of transcripts according to the PPs. Therefore, in order to evaluate how the inference of genomic imprinting by our model is affected by our choice of empirical hyper-parameter values we performed the following sensitivity analysis. The empirical value that we chose for each of the five hyper-parameters: <i>\u03c4</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>\u03bd</i>, <i>\u03bb</i>, and <i>p</i>, was perturbed by selecting four other values. Specifically, we perturbed the empirical <i>\u03c4</i> = 0.1 value with 0.005, 0.01, 1, and 2 thus both lowering and elevating the posterior probability of an effect being significant; we perturbed the empirical <i>c</i> = 4.25 value only with the higher values: 1.7, 3.4, 5.3125, and 10.625 as 4.25 was found to be approximately the minimal value for detecting significant effects; we perturbed the empirical <i>\u03bd</i> = 2.5 value with 5, 12.5, 25, and 50 as <i>\u03bd</i> cannot assume values lower than 2; we perturbed the empirical <i>\u03bb</i> = 0.04 value with 0.002, 0.004, 0.4, and 0.8 shifting the <i>\u03c3</i><sup>2</sup> prior distribution from informative to uninformative; and finally, we perturbed the empirical <i>p</i> = 0.1 value with higher prior probabilities of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. In each such perturbation we re-fitted our model to the data where all other hyper-parameter values are held fixed at their original empirical unperturbed values (thereby achieving a one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis). We assessed the perturbed results using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in which the imprinted transcripts obtained by the unperturbed inferences were used as the ground-truth positives, and all other non-imprinted transcripts were used as ground-truth negatives. For practical computational considerations, for all perturbations we used a random sample of 10% of the 47,676 transcripts in our data set. In all perturbations the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was found to be 1, except for the <i>\u03c4</i> = 1 and <i>\u03c4</i> = 2 perturbations which obtained AUCs of 0.99 and 0.95, respectively (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). These results therefore indicate that the ranking of transcripts according to the PP of the parental effect, obtained by our model, is robust to the choice of hyper-parameter empirical values. Therefore, the practice employed in this study of selecting empirical values, setting a parental effect PP cutoff, and experimentally confirming all transcripts with a PP of parental effect above that cutoff, is a reasonable choice for obtaining reliable inference of genomic imprinting from RNA-seq data."

In order to represent a gene by a single transcript, for each gene we chose the isoform with the most significant parental bias (i.e., the isoform with the maximal parental effect PP), derived from the model fitted to both age groups. The same criterion was also used to select between host and resident genes as the representative of their genomic location. In order to assign genes to clusters we linearly scanned each chromosome from its 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 end. The most upstream gene on a chromosome (where we represent the start and end sites of genes encoded on the antisense strand as their end and start sites on the sense strand, respectively), was assigned to the first imprinted cluster of that chromosome. Then, if the start site of the next downstream gene is within 1 MB of the end site of the previous upstream gene it was assigned to the same cluster, else it was assigned to a new cluster. Thus, the maximal distance between any two genes within a cluster can be 1 MB. We then defined the genes with a parental bias larger than 85:15% as candidate centers of their respective clusters. Since in some imprinted clusters more than a single gene met this condition, we grouped all physically consecutive candidate cluster center genes to a single gene which start site was defined as the start site of the most upstream candidate center gene and end site was defined as the end site of the most downstream candidate center gene. If an imprinted cluster resulted with more than one such group of candidate center genes flanked by genes with parental biases lower than 85:15% it was broken down to sub-clusters centered on each of these candidate centers. We defined the boundaries of each sub-cluster as half the distance between the end site of its center gene and the start site of the center gene of the adjacent sub-cluster (or up to 1 MB in the cases of the most up- and downstream sub-clusters) and thus flanking genes were assigned to the sub-cluster which boundary was downstream to their start site location. We finally removed any gene which start site was more than 1 MB away from its respective cluster center. We then fitted a general linear fixed effects model to non-cluster center genes, where we defined the response as the parental bias and the fixed effect as the intergenic distance from the cluster center."

                                "text": "To test whether the clustered organization of mouse imprinted genes with weak parental-expression biases (lower than 85:15%) is conserved in mammalian evolution, which therefore suggests functional importance, we carried out the following analysis of conservation of micro-synteny. We defined a pair of adjacent genes in the mouse reference genome as any two genes for which intergenic distance was below 1 MB (as 92% of the imprinted genes in our data are within 1 MB of another imprinted gene). Using this set of adjacent pairs of genes as reference we then constructed a phyletic pattern of orthologous gene pairs as follows. We downloaded the gene orthology assignment between the mouse reference genome and all mammalian reference genomes available in the Ensembl genome browser (<a href=\"#bib30\">Flicek et al., 2014</a>), which are assembled at the chromosome level. This included the genomes of the following species: opossum, pig, sheep, cow, horse, cat, dog, rat, marmoset, rhesus, orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee, and human (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). For each comparative genome, if both orthologs of a mouse adjacent gene pair exist in that genome, we labeled this orthologous pair by \u20181\u2019 if their intergenic distance is lower than 1 MB (i.e., they are also adjacent in the comparative genome) and \u20180\u2019 otherwise (i.e., they are not adjacent in the comparative genome). If either or both orthologs do not exist in the comparative genome we labeled this pair as \u2018?\u2019 (i.e., unknown). Ensembl tables of orthology assignment provide two types of homology between a query and search genomes: a one-to-one and a one-to-many homology. In addition, these tables also provide a binary confidence score for the orthology assignment (0 for low and 1 for high). As a conservative approach, we filtered out all one-to-many and low confidence orthologs unless the genes orthologous to the mouse pair were found to be within 1 MB of each other. As a result we obtained a phyletic pattern, which is a type of a multiple sequence alignment, where in our case each site in the phyletic pattern is a gene pair orthologous to an adjacent gene pair in the mouse genome with the characters of \u20181\u2019, \u20180\u2019, and \u2018?\u2019. All phyletic pattern columns in which all sites were \u2018?\u2019, were removed thus obtaining a phyletic pattern of 409,874 sites. We then fitted to this phyletic pattern and corresponding phylogenetic species tree (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) a probabilistic phylogenetic model estimating the substitution rates between presence and absence (\u20181\u2019 and \u20180\u2019, respectively) and vice-versa (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen et al., 2008</a>). We specifically allowed the presence/absence ratio to vary across sites and the presence and absence probabilities at the root of the phylogenetic tree to be independently estimated. As a result, we obtained a posterior expectation of the absence-to-presence substitution rate (i.e., rate of gene-pair gain: \u20180\u2019 to \u20181\u2019) and a posterior expectation of the presence-to-absence substitution rate (i.e., rate of gene-pair loss: \u20181\u2019 to \u20180\u2019) for each site in the phyletic pattern. The propensity of each orthologous gene pair to be adjacent throughout the mammalian evolution represented by the species used in this analysis is therefore the posterior expectation of its rate of gene-pair gain divided by the posterior expectation of its rate of gene-pair loss. In order to test whether the propensity of adjacency of orthologs of mouse weakly parentally-biased imprinted gene pairs (with a bias lower than 85:15%), is significantly higher than what would be expected by chance, we compared the mean propensity of adjacency of these gene pairs with the mean propensity of adjacency of all gene pairs in the phyletic pattern using a one-sided <i>z</i>-test. We note that not applying any distance cutoff for defining a pair of adjacent genes means that genes with much longer intergenic distances will be included for which the micro-synteny is expected to be much less evolutionary conserved thus potentially biasing our analysis."

But the plot shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a> is trimodal, not bimodal. The bimodality of expression levels in RNA-seq data is usually seen with modes around TPM \u223c0.01-0.1 (\u201coff\u201d genes) and 10-1000 (\u201con\u201d genes). I think these are your rightmost two modes. The third (leftmost) mode at log(TPM)\u223c-10 is, I'm guessing, a software artifact of MM-SEQ estimation of expression levels given little or no mapped reads. It seems unlikely that you have any data for a transcript at TPM = 10^-10. I think you should be drawing your cutoff threshold at around log(TPM)\u223c0, between the rightmost two modes. One place this affects you is in the top panel of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <i>Fkbp6</i>: I think this gene is basically off (TPM \u223c 0.1 or so), and accordingly it's showing very high variance."

The orange dot with coordinates at \u223c0.8,0.8 was considered a false positive because the preferred allele observed in the RNA-seq data is opposite to the one observed by pyrosequencing. This dot represents one of the transcripts of the <i>Slc22a1</i> gene that on the RNA-seq platform shows that approximately 80% of its expression comes from the maternal allele, which in spite of substantial variability among biological samples has a marginal posterior probability above 0.95. However, pyrosequencing analysis of this same transcript reports an average of approximately 80% of its expression from the paternal allele with high variability and this effect is not significant (PP = 0.86). A similar situation occurred for <i>Cpa4</i>, which is represented by the orange dot at \u223c0.6,0.8. The RNA-seq data show that approximately 60% of its expression comes from the maternal allele, whereas in pyrosequencing a more substantial 80% maternal expression is observed, yet due to the high variability this effect is not significant (PP = 0.77). Since these two genes are the only examples of this situation, it is clearly an exception in our analyses. We updated the legend of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> to clarify this point."

But the plot shown in</i> <a href=\"#fig1s1\"><i>Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</i></a> <i>is trimodal, not bimodal. The bimodality of expression levels in RNA-seq data is usually seen with modes around TPM \u223c0.01-0.1 (\u201coff\u201d genes) and 10-1000 (\u201con\u201d genes). I think these are your rightmost two modes. The third (leftmost) mode at log(TPM)\u223c-10 is, I'm guessing, a software artifact of MM-SEQ estimation of expression levels given little or no mapped reads. It seems unlikely that you have any data for a transcript at TPM = 10^-10. I think you should be drawing your cutoff threshold at around log(TPM)\u223c0, between the rightmost two modes. One place this affects you is in the top panel of</i> <a href=\"#fig2\"><i>Figure 2</i></a><i>,</i> Fkbp6<i>: I think this gene is basically off (TPM \u223c 0.1 or so), and accordingly it's showing very high variance</i>."

The distribution of ln(TPM) in a single RNA-seq sample is indeed trimodal, and the left mode is indeed what MMSEQ reports, where for transcripts whose expression levels are nearly, but not absolutely, zero MMSEQ reports posterior FPKM samples as low as 10<sup>-07</sup>. If MMSEQ\u2019s posterior FPKM variances are taken to represent the expression-level uncertainty (as we did in our model) this results with false negatives in cases where a silenced or nearly silenced allele is in the left mode but due to this artificially high uncertainty the parental bias does not come out as significant. We are aware of this limitation and all transcripts whose mean posterior FPKM (which we convert to TPM units) fell below our cutoff were set to zero. We subsequently add the cutoff value to all posterior TPM samples thereby avoid taking the log of zero. We had an error in the figure and associated text indicating the cutoff is determined as the local minimum between the left two modes for each RNA-seq sample. We use a fixed cutoff of TPM = 0.01 for all RNA-seq samples and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a> is now updated and shows the mean ln(TPM) values of all expressed transcripts (not only heterozygous) across all our RNA-seq samples."

Using a more stringent expression level cutoff, which we determined empirically and describe in the Materials and methods (represented by the dashed line in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplements 1A-B</a> and the newly added 1C), has a negligible effect on our results."

Higher expression levels do make it is easier to detect parental biases (as are more polymorphic sites that phase the reads, as well as lower redundancy between the different isoforms). Indeed, inference of parental biases at the range of very low expression levels (left parts of <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplements 1A-B</a>) is significantly affected. The location of the parental biases at that range of expression levels reflects the low identifiability \u2013 MMSEQ reports high uncertainty in the allele-specific expression levels of these transcripts and our model propagates this uncertainty. As a result, the posterior distribution of the parental bias (which prior is at 0.5) thus has higher variance (at the most extreme case the posterior distribution will cover the entire 0.5-1 range), and the mean of that posterior distribution is thus likely to be close to 0.75. This trend is also visible when we contrast the parental bias inferred by RNA-seq and pyrosequencing versus expression levels (newly added <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>). Based on this figure we defined a more stringent expression level cutoff, where the discrepancy between the parental biases inferred by RNA-seq and pyrosequencing drops dramatically.
