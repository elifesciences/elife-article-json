One hypothesis is that frequent codons are translated relatively rapidly. However, there is little direct, in vivo, evidence regarding codon-specific translation rates. In this study, we generate high-coverage data using ribosome profiling in yeast, analyze using a novel algorithm, and deduce events at the A- and P-sites of the ribosome. Different codons are decoded at different rates in the A-site. In general, frequent codons are decoded more quickly than rare codons, and AT-rich codons are decoded more quickly than GC-rich codons. At the P-site, proline is slow in forming peptide bonds. We also apply our algorithm to short footprints from a different conformation of the ribosome and find strong amino acid-specific (not codon-specific) effects that may reflect interactions with the exit tunnel of the ribosome."

One hypothesis is that frequent codons are translated relatively rapidly. However, there is little direct, in vivo, evidence regarding codon-specific translation rates. In this study, we generate high-coverage data using ribosome profiling in yeast, analyze using a novel algorithm, and deduce events at the A- and P-sites of the ribosome. Different codons are decoded at different rates in the A-site. In general, frequent codons are decoded more quickly than rare codons, and AT-rich codons are decoded more quickly than GC-rich codons. At the P-site, proline is slow in forming peptide bonds. We also apply our algorithm to short footprints from a different conformation of the ribosome and find strong amino acid-specific (not codon-specific) effects that may reflect interactions with the exit tunnel of the ribosome."

By using a computer algorithm, Gardin, Yeasmin et al. were able to measure just how often each kind of sense codon was trapped inside the ribosome and use this as a measure of how quickly each codon is decoded. The more often a given codon is used in a gene sequence, the less likely it was found to be trapped inside the ribosome\u2014which suggests that these codons are decoded quicker than other codons and pass through the ribosome more quickly. Put another way, it appears that genes tend to use the codons that can be read the fastest."

The method described by Gardin, Yeasmin et al. for peering into a decoding ribosome may now help future studies that aim to answer other questions about how proteins are built."

In particular, it has been suggested that the frequently-used codons are translated more rapidly than rarely-used codons, perhaps because tRNAs for the frequent codons are relatively highly expressed (<a href=\"#bib48\">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</a>). However, there have also been competing hypotheses, including the idea that frequently-used codons are translated more accurately (<a href=\"#bib48\">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</a>). Genes are often recoded to use frequent codons to increase protein expression (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burgess-Brown et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Maertens et al., 2010</a>), but without any solid understanding of why this manipulation is effective. There is little or no direct in vivo evidence as to whether the more common codons are indeed translated more rapidly than the rarer codons. Even if they are, the fact that translation is typically limited by initiation, not elongation, leaves the effectiveness of codon optimization a puzzle (<a href=\"#bib48\">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</a>)."

The basis of the method is that a translating ribosome protects a region of mRNA from nuclease digestion, generating a 30 base \u2018footprint\u2019. The footprint is roughly centered on the A-site of the ribosome. If some particular codon in the A-site were translated slowly, then the ribosome would dwell at this position, and so footprints generated from ribosomes at this position would be relatively common. Thus, if one looked at the number of ribosome footprints generated along an mRNA, there should be more footprints centered at every codon that is translated slowly and fewer centered at every codon translated rapidly; in principle, this is a method for measuring rates of translation of individual codons."

However, this analysis in its simplest form would overweight the highly expressed genes, which account for a large fraction of total reads\u2014that is, a relatively small number of highly expressed genes would dominate the analysis. But because there are extreme peaks and valleys in ribosome footprint profiles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and because these are not primarily due to codon usage, this simple analysis would likely fail, because the results would depend mainly on a relatively small number of chromosome positions, and because of the peak-to-valley variability affecting these positions. Defining the right normalizations to compensate for differences in gene expression, gene length, sequence composition, etc, is complicated and problematic."

For footprints 10-codons long, there are exactly 10 classes of footprints that contain this particular CTC and fit entirely in the window. That is, the CTC of interest can occur at position 1 of the footprint, or position 2, \u2026., or position 10. Analysis was restricted to windows with at least 20 total reads and at least 3 non-empty classes. For our four datasets discussed below, there was an average of 408, 1586, 1749, or 2868 qualifying windows per codon, respectively (more windows for the abundant codons, fewer for the rare codons)."

That is, in a window centered on CTC and containing 100 footprints, one expects 10 footprints at each of the 10 positions, a relative frequency of 0.1 (10/100) at each position. On the other hand, if the ribosome was to dwell for an extended time over the CTC whenever that codon was at, say, position 6 of the footprint, then there might be 30 footprints with CTC in position 6, and about 8 footprints at each of the other 9 positions, thus giving a frequency distribution with a peak at position 6. Many such relative frequency distributions can be fairly averaged over all windows over all genes centered on a specific codon. Regions on highly expressed genes can be fairly compared with similar regions on genes with lower expression, because we are dealing with relative frequency distributions. Each window thus represents an independent trial of the ribosome's dwell time over each given codon. Averaging over the hundreds or thousands of windows in the genome generates a statistically rigorous analysis. Note that we do not attempt any normalization based on gene expression\u2014instead, we take each qualifying window as an independent experiment, regardless of level of expression, then average all frequency distributions from all windows for each codon. A related idea was also used by <a href=\"#bib34\">Lareau et al. (2014)</a>, although on significantly different data, and with normalization by gene."

Similarly when CTC is in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th positions. However, there is a relative over abundance of footprints that have CTC at the 6th position. In fact, for CTC at the 6th position, averaged over 451 windows (in the case of this rare codon), there are 1.89-fold more footprints than at the baseline.

Proline is a unique amino acid in having a secondary rather than a primary amino group, and so it is less reactive in peptide bond formation. Proline forms peptide bonds slowly (<a href=\"#bib43\">Muto and Ito, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wohlgemuth et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pavlov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Johansson et al., 2011</a>), and proline has been associated with slow translation in footprinting experiments (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>). Our result that the ribosome slows with proline at position 5 is consistent with this and tends to confirm our assignment of position 5 to the P-site and, therefore, position 6 to the A-site. A few other residues also seem slightly slow at position 5 (e.g., Asn, Gly, see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), possibly due to low reactivity in peptide bond formation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johansson et al., 2011</a>)."

We wondered whether the apparent slowness of proline at both positions 5 and 6 was an informatic artefact due to extreme slowness for ProPro dipeptides. We redid the original analysis after excluding all footprints encoding ProPro dipeptides. Results did not change significantly; Pro still appeared to be slow at both positions 5 and 6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). On the other hand, when we looked specifically at footprints containing a ProPro dipeptide, there was a very large peak at position 5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), consistent with the very slow peptide bond formation seen in studies cited above."

In particular, that dataset was generated by adding cycloheximide to the growing culture, then harvesting (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>), whereas our data were generated by flash-freezing first, then adding cycloheximide to the frozen cells.

                                "text": "There are strong correlations between codon usage, the number of tRNA genes for the relevant tRNA, and tRNA abundance (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ikemura, 1981</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tuller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Novoa and Ribas de Pouplana, 2012</a>). Although one cannot determine causation from this correlation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</a>), nevertheless it is consistent with the idea that the rate of decoding in translation is at least partly limited by tRNA concentration. Most of our results are consistent with this. However, there are some interesting exceptions. In yeast, the 61 sense codons are decoded by only 42 tRNAs. There are 12 pairs of codons that share a single tRNA (e.g., Phe TTC and TTT; Tyr TAT and TAC; etc) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Roth, 2012</a>). In many but not all cases, the RRT of the two codons is similar (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), consistent with the \u2018concentration\u2019 hypothesis. However, there are also cases where the RRT appears to be significantly different for two codons sharing the same tRNA. For instance, the Cys codon TGC has an RRT of 1.23, while TGT has an RRT of 0.81 (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Both codons are recognized by the same tRNA, which in this case is complementary for TGC, and wobble for TGT. Similarly, the Gly codon GGC has an RRT of 1.22 (tRNA is complementary), while GGT has an RRT of 0.93 (tRNA is wobble). Both these relationships (RRT for TGC &gt; TGT, and RRT for GGC &gt; GGT) were true in all five datasets (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In both the cases, the perfect match is decoded more slowly than the wobble match and in both cases, the slower, complementary pairing has a G:C match at the third (i.e., wobble) position. These and other similar examples (not shown) suggest that the RRT depends on more than just the concentration of the relevant tRNA. Perhaps the long RRTs for these GC-rich codons are related to the time needed to eject incorrectly paired anti-codons of incorrect tRNAs, although this explanation is somewhat at odds with the literature (<a href=\"#bib13\">Daviter et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gromadski et al., 2006</a>). Alternatively, it has been suggested that translocation can occur more quickly when the codon:anticodon interaction is weaker (<a href=\"#bib55\">Semenkov et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Khade and Joseph, 2011</a>)."

It is the long class that is seen in cycloheximide experiments, and which we have characterized above. The short (20\u201322 nuc.) footprints seem to represent a different conformation of the ribosome, perhaps one that occurs when the ribosome translocates along the mRNA. Furthermore, Lareau et al. found that treatment of cells with the elongation inhibitor anisomycin efficiently generates short footprints. Lareau et al. suggest that the long and short footprints are reporting on two different states of translation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lareau et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "We applied RRT analysis to the short footprints generated by Lareau et al., with special focus on the footprints after anisomycin treatment. All three of their anisomycin datasets were studied, and the pairwise correlations between the RRT results for these three datasets were very high, ranging from 0.89 to 0.998. Partial results are shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>, and complete results are shown in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. RRT analysis showed a series of peaks at different positions along the 7-codon footprint. The RRT values for the short footprints did not significantly correlate with RRT values for the long footprints, even when the phases of the footprints were shifted. This suggests, in agreement with Lareau et al., that the short and long footprints are indeed reporting on different translational processes. Furthermore, for the short footprints the RRT values are amino acid-specific, while for the long footprints at position 6, the RRT values are codon-specific (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This again indicates that the two kinds of footprints are reporting on different translational processes. The amino acids in the peaks at positions 3, 5, and 6 are shown in <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>: the peak at position 3 contains glycine; the peak at position 5 contains smallish hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Val, Ile, and to some extent Phe), and the peak at position 6 is dominated by the two basic amino acids, Arg and Lys. It has previously been shown that basic amino acids can cause a pause in elongation by interacting with the ribosome exit tunnel (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Charneski and Hurst, 2013</a>). The basis of the anisomycin arrest is partly but not fully understood (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hansen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blaha et al., 2008</a>), and so it is difficult to clearly interpret these results (but see \u2018Discussion\u2019). Nevertheless, the application of RRT analysis to the anisomycin-generated footprints gives strong specific signals that are unlikely to be explained by a random process. We note, however, that results from the short footprints from untreated (no anisomycin) cells are only modestly correlated (0.23) with results from short footprints from the anisomycin-treated cells (data not shown)."

During translation, the ribosome must sample many incorrect tRNAs at the A-site before finding a correct tRNA. It must match the anti-codon of that correct tRNA with the codon; after such matching, there is a conformational change around the codon\u2013anticodon interaction at the decoding center (<a href=\"#bib14\">Demeshkina et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zeng et al., 2014</a>). The ribosome must form the peptide bond (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rodnina, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Polikanov et al., 2014</a>), translocate (<a href=\"#bib55\">Semenkov et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Khade and Joseph, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>), and eject the empty tRNA. The nascent peptide must make its way through the ribosome exit tunnel (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Petrone et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wilson and Beckmann, 2011</a>). Depending on the rate of each of these events, the concentration of the various tRNAs might or might not have a detectable effect on the overall rate of translation. Our findings that (i) the more frequent codons (i.e., the ones with the highest tRNA concentrations) are decoded rapidly; and (ii) GC-rich codons are decoded slowly; and (iii) proline is slow in the P-site, suggest that there are at least three processes that happen somewhat slowly and on a similar timescale. The high rate of decoding for high concentration tRNAs may reflect the relatively short time it takes for the ribosome to find a high-concentration correct tRNA among many incorrect tRNAs. The fact that we detect proline-specific delays of a similar magnitude to the rare-codon specific delays suggest that peptide bond formation and identification of the correct tRNA are happening on similar time scales. In general, this is what one might expect from the evolution of such an important process as protein synthesis\u2014if one process was entirely rate-limiting, there would be very strong selection for greater speed in that process, until a point is reached where it \u2018catches up\u2019 with other processes, and several processes together are then rate-limiting."

Nevertheless, on a genome-wide (and not gene-specific) scale, the use of faster codons would mean that a given genomic set of mRNAs would require (or titrate out) fewer ribosomes to make a given amount of protein than the same set of mRNAs using slower codons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersson and Kurland, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</a>). Based on our RRT measurements, and taking into account the different copy numbers of different mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lipson et al., 2009</a>), we roughly estimate that yeast requires about 5% fewer ribosomes than if they were to make protein at the same overall rate but using each synonymous codon at an equal frequency (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This provides at least a sufficient reason for the bias towards faster synonymous codons."

These short footprints seem to report on a different translational process than the long footprints seen in cycloheximide experiments. We see that the basic amino acids Arg and Lys are slow at position 6; small hydrophobic amino acids are slow at position 5; and glycine is slow at position 3. While we know too little about the nature of the short footprints to reliably interpret these results, one speculative possibility is that the results report on the interaction of amino acids in the nascent peptide chain with the exit tunnel of the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib52\">Raue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Petrone et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Berndt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bhushan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wilson and Beckmann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gumbart et al., 2012</a>). We find Arg and Lys slow at position 6, and this correlates with the fact that these basic amino acids cause a pause by interacting with the exit tunnel (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Charneski and Hurst, 2013</a>).

The Spearman rank correlation between the RRTs as calculated by the mean, and by the median, is 0.97, while the Kendall Tau correlation is 0.89."

Each codon's RRT values along the positions of a footprint may be considered as a k-dimensional vector, where k is the number of positions in the footprint (10 for long reads vs 7 for short reads). We consider the position in k-dimensional space of the end-point of this vector. For the set of synonymous codons for a particular amino acid, we consider the set of endpoints. For any given set of c such endpoints, we can compute the average pairwise distance d between them over all c(c-1)/2 pairs of points. If all codons for an amino acid behave similarly, then the endpoints are close together, and the distance d is relatively small, indicating codon coherence (amino-acid specific behavior), whereas if the various codons for a given amino acid behave differently (non-coherence, codon-specific behavior), then the distance d is relatively large."

In each case, the mRNA would occupy, or titrate out, a different number of ribosomes. A transcriptome of mRNAs using only the slowest codons would require more ribosomes to make a given amount of total protein in a given time than a transcriptome of mRNAs using only the fastest codons. We roughly estimated the size of this effect for the range of codon decoding speeds we observed. We generated <i>in silico</i> a yeast transcriptome using only the fastest codon for each amino acid at position 6 (from <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) or only the slowest codon or a random mixture of codons. Furthermore, we weighted the abundance of each mRNA according to its actual abundance as measured by <a href=\"#bib37\">Lipson et al. (2009)</a>. We then compared the relative time required to translate each of these <i>in silico</i> transcriptomes by a set number of ribosomes based on the RRT values for each codon at position 5 and 6, and also assuming that the relevant delay is the delay at position 5 plus the delay at position 6 (since these two reactions must occur sequentially and not simultaneously before the ribosome can shift along the mRNA). In doing this, we noted that the RRT values for position 5 are negatively correlated with those at position 6. Results are as follows: the random encoding requires 1.050 as long as WT; the slowest encoding requires 1.168 as long as WT; and the fastest encoding requires 0.930 as long as WT. Note that this estimate uses the simplification that each species of mRNA will initiate translation at the same rate. A more accurate calculation in which the more abundant mRNAs initiate more rapidly than average would increase the difference between the WT and the random encodings."

However, the third reviewer who is more knowledgeable in statistics/bioinformatics was rather critical, as detailed below. A major appeal of your work is that you arrive at a different conclusion than previous work Qian et al and Charneski & Hurst, using ribosome-profiling data, which has concluded that there is little or no difference in the rates of decoding by tRNAs. The latter conclusions contradict a large body of previous work in genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry of translation, which clearly showed that there are significant differences in the rates of decoding. This naturally led to a significant amount of confusion in the field. You suggest that the abundant transient pausing on mRNAs, in the previous published study, caused by other effects, probably made it impossible to see the relatively more subtle differences in ribosome residence time derived from differences in codon recognition."

The time that ribosome spends at a particular codon is only one of the factors affecting the number of footprints aligning to that codon. The others are sequence coverage (i), initiation rate for the start codon of corresponding ORF (ii) and concentration of corresponding mRNA (iii). These factors can be estimated (e.g. mRNA-seq can estimate relative mRNA levels) or the data could be normalized in the ways that would minimize the contribution of these factors, e.g. a footprint density at a particular location can be normalized over the cumulative density for the entire dataset or for individual mRNAs. Such normalization procedures aren't perfect and may generate certain artifacts and Gardin et al do discuss it rightfully to some extent. However, there are other factors that are more difficult to take into account, such as the effect of antibiotics on capture of the ribosomes at particular locations or even at specific ribosomal conformations leading to differing length of footprints, see <a href=\"#bib34\">Lareau et al 2014</a> <i>eLife</i> [PMID: 24842990] for more information.

Their presence can be easily seen in the data analyzed here with RRT as well, e.g. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; codon 10 corresponds to the 5' ends of the footprints and show a variability comparable to that of position 6 (btw plotting 64 curves on the same diagram is not very effective, the authors should explore other statistics for measuring variability within a distribution). Most likely this variability is due to sequence specificity of RNAse cleavage and/or adapter ligation. The other factor that is highly relevant to measuring decoding rates is PCR amplification of cDNA libraries. PCR amplifies fragments non-linearly, and the ratio between a low abounded fragment and a highly abounded fragment would likely increase after PCR. To control for that the initial step of cDNA amplification should be carried out with RT primers containing random indexes. So that only sequences corresponding to unique ribosome protected fragments are counted. The reviewer understands that doing ribosome profiling this way would require a new experiment and he does not expect the authors doing it for this work, but the issue needs to be at least caveated."

We had finished writing our manuscript in April, before the Lareau paper came out. For various reasons, we did not submit the manuscript to <i>eLife</i> until June, and in the meantime we did not follow the relevant literature as closely as we should have. We were not aware of the Lareau paper until the reviewers pointed it out. Of course, it is a highly relevant paper that needs to be addressed. We have addressed it in this revised manuscript in a fair amount of detail. The biggest impact is that the Lareau paper provides us with short footprints from anisomycin arrest, and we have applied our method to these short footprints. The new results obtained are in our opinion really interesting, and they are described in a new section of text, a new Figure, and a new Table. We agree with Lareau et al that these short footprints are reporting on a different translational event than the long footprints, so the analysis of the short footprints does not in any way conflict with any of our previous conclusions, but does give us significant new conclusions. We also think it is striking that, although we think the Lareau et al. analysis was very good, nevertheless our analysis got quite a bit more out of the short footprint data, showing the value of our new method. Finally, Lareau et al. got some long footprints without use of cycloheximide, and when we analyzed these by our methods, we got a reasonable correlation (0.47) with our results, which argue that cycloheximide is not introducing severe artefacts."

The time that ribosome spends at a particular codon is only one of the factors affecting the number of footprints aligning to that codon. The others are sequence coverage (i), initiation rate for the start codon of corresponding ORF (ii) and concentration of corresponding mRNA (iii). These factors can be estimated (e.g. mRNA-seq can estimate relative mRNA levels) or the data could be normalized in the ways that would minimize the contribution of these factors, e.g. a footprint density at a particular location can be normalized over the cumulative density for the entire dataset or for individual mRNAs. Such normalization procedures aren't perfect and may generate certain artifacts and Gardin et al do discuss it rightfully to some extent. However, there are other factors that are more difficult to take into account, such as the effect of antibiotics on capture of the ribosomes at particular locations or even at specific ribosomal conformations leading to differing length of footprints, see</i> <a href=\"#bib34\"><i>Lareau et al 2014</i></a> <i>eLife [PMID: 24842990] for more information.

Most likely this variability is due to sequence specificity of RNAse cleavage and/or adapter ligation. The other factor that is highly relevant to measuring decoding rates is PCR amplification of cDNA libraries. PCR amplifies fragments non-linearly, and the ratio between a low abounded fragment and a highly abounded fragment would likely increase after PCR. To control for that the initial step of cDNA amplification should be carried out with RT primers containing random indexes. So that only sequences corresponding to unique ribosome protected fragments are counted. The reviewer understands that doing ribosome profiling this way would require a new experiment and he does not expect the authors doing it for this work, but the issue needs to be at least caveated</i>."
