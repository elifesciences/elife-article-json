We have identified a conserved protein and interactors required for maintaining cell adhesion during a simple collective migration in the developing <i>C. elegans</i> male gonad.  LINKIN is a previously uncharacterized, transmembrane protein conserved throughout Metazoa. We identified seven atypical FG-GAP domains in the extracellular domain, which potentially folds into a \u03b2-propeller structure resembling the \u03b1-integrin ligand-binding domain. <i>C. elegans</i> LNKN-1 localizes to the plasma membrane of all gonadal cells, with apical and lateral bias. We identified the LINKIN interactors RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and \u03b1-tubulin by using SILAC mass spectrometry on human HEK 293T cells and testing candidates for <i>lnkn-1</i>-like function in <i>C. elegans</i> male gonad.  We propose that LINKIN promotes adhesion between neighboring cells through its extracellular domain and regulates microtubule dynamics through RUVBL proteins at its intracellular domain."
