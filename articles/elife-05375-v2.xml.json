The sRNA RydC of <i>Salmonella sp</i>. and <i>Escherichia coli</i> is an example of this class of riboregulators. Like many other sRNAs, RydC bears a \u2018seed\u2019 region that recognises specific transcripts through base-pairing, and its activities are facilitated by the RNA chaperone Hfq. The crystal structure of RydC in complex with <i>E. coli</i> Hfq at a 3.48 \u00c5 resolution illuminates how the protein interacts with and presents the sRNA for target recognition. Consolidating the protein\u2013RNA complex is a host of distributed interactions mediated by the natively unstructured termini of Hfq. Based on the structure and other data, we propose a model for a dynamic effector complex comprising Hfq, small RNA, and the cognate mRNA target."

The sRNA RydC of <i>Salmonella sp</i>. and <i>Escherichia coli</i> is an example of this class of riboregulators. Like many other sRNAs, RydC bears a \u2018seed\u2019 region that recognises specific transcripts through base-pairing, and its activities are facilitated by the RNA chaperone Hfq. The crystal structure of RydC in complex with <i>E. coli</i> Hfq at a 3.48 \u00c5 resolution illuminates how the protein interacts with and presents the sRNA for target recognition. Consolidating the protein\u2013RNA complex is a host of distributed interactions mediated by the natively unstructured termini of Hfq. Based on the structure and other data, we propose a model for a dynamic effector complex comprising Hfq, small RNA, and the cognate mRNA target."

In bacteria, the control of gene expression post-transcription is mediated in part by small RNAs (sRNAs), and their contributions enrich the computational complexity and repertoire of regulatory circuits (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beisel and Storz, 2011</a>). Bacterial sRNAs are typically 50 to 300 nucleotides in length (<a href=\"#bib52\">Storz et al., 2011</a>), and each control expression of a distinct set of target mRNAs, which they recognise with high specificity and apparent precision. One of the major facilitators of sRNA activity in bacteria is the protein Hfq, which promotes pairing of an sRNA with its target mRNA in solution (<a href=\"#bib29\">M\u00f8ller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vogel and Luisi, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Panja and Woodson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Lay et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, the kinetics of target pairing seem an essential aspect of sRNA action in vivo, as many of these sRNAs affect rates of translation or decay, either positively or negatively depending on target and context (<a href=\"#bib51\">Storz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fr\u00f6hlich and Vogel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Desnoyers and Mass\u00e9, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Papenfort et al., 2013</a>). It can be envisaged how Hfq acts as a catalyst for such recognition in vivo, but the question naturally arises how sRNAs generally achieve precision, accuracy, and speed in producing their effects and avoid undesired off-target consequences. The key to understanding these fundamental processes of sRNA-based regulation is to determine how RNAs are bound and presented by Hfq and other effector proteins."

Hfq bears an \u03b1 + \u03b2 fold that is the signature of the highly conserved family of Sm/Lsm proteins that draws members from all domains of life (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kambach et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wilusz and Wilusz, 2013</a>). Like other proteins of this extensive group, the bacterial Hfq self-assembles into a ring-like architecture. Hfq of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and other eubacteria forms a compact hexameric toroid that presents two structurally non-equivalent concave surfaces for molecular recognition; these faces are referred to as the proximal and distal faces, with the former exposing an N-terminal \u03b1-helix (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schumacher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Link et al., 2009</a>). Crystallographic studies have identified interactions of short RNA polymers with either of these two surfaces and have inferred sequence preferences that have been corroborated and refined by mutagenesis and solution binding studies (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schumacher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Link et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sauer and Weichenrieder, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Robinson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Peng et al., 2014</a>). According to these results, the proximal site interacts preferentially with uridine-rich sequences, while the distal site favours the binding of ARN or ARNN motifs (with R being a purine and N any nucleotide) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schumacher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Link et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sauer and Weichenrieder, 2011</a>). In addition to the distal and proximal faces, the torus-shaped Hfq hexamer bears a convex circumferential rim that has recently been identified as a surface contributing to RNA binding (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sauer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Structural studies of the hetero-heptameric Sm assembly from the mammalian splicing machinery have identified RNA binding surfaces that share some similarities with the bacterial counterpart (<a href=\"#bib24\">Leung et al., 2011</a>)."

In some sRNAs, a target-recognition region is presented at or near the 5\u2032-end (<a href=\"#bib38\">Papenfort et al., 2010</a>). For another subset of sRNAs, several pairing regions are non-continuous and each can independently bind distinct targets (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beisel and Storz, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shao et al., 2013</a>). In both cases, the sRNA recognition site (referred to as the \u2018seed\u2019) and the target can have imperfect complementarity of various lengths with interactions being as short as 6 base-pairs, as seen for example in the SgrS/<i>ptsG</i> mRNA pair from <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib21a\">Kawamoto et al., 2006</a>). To fully understand the mechanism of sRNA mediated regulation, it is important to address the questions of how the intricate RNA folds are recognised, how the seeds are presented, and how the pairing of sRNAs with mRNAs is facilitated. As the sRNAs, mRNAs, and their complexes can all be remodelled upon binding Hfq, the rules for recognition are likely to be highly dependent on context."

RydC is proposed to have a pseudoknot fold that exposes a 5\u2032 seed sequence, and the in vivo stability of RydC requires Hfq (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fr\u00f6hlich et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bordeau and Felden, 2014</a>).

                                "text": "To assess the molecular mechanism underlying the intrinsic instability of the RydC-S1 mutant, we compared its turnover rate to the wild-type RNA in the presence and absence of the chaperone Hfq (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B/C</a>). To this end, both RydC and RydC-S1 were expressed in <i>Salmonella</i> under the control of the constitutive P<sub>L</sub> promoter from high-copy plasmids. At exponential growth (OD<sub>600</sub> of 1), transcription was stopped by the addition of rifampicin, and RNA levels were monitored at various time-points after treatment. As previously shown (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fr\u00f6hlich et al., 2013</a>), RydC is very stable in wild-type cells (half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) &gt;32 min), while RydC-S1 decayed rapidly (t<sub>1/2</sub> \u223c2 min). In contrast, the half-life of RydC is already markedly reduced in <i>hfq</i> mutant cells (t<sub>1/2</sub> \u223c4 min) and there is some further acceleration of the decay rate for RydC-S1, matching that of RydC in the absence of Hfq. This observation led us to assume that RydC stability depends on both the integrity of the pseudoknot fold and the ability to associate with the Hfq protein. Both the wild-type RydC and RydC-S1 mutant bind Hfq in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with in vitro synthesized RNA although the affinity of the mutant is lower than for the wild-type RydC (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Competition experiments suggest that the binding sites for the RydC and RydC-S1 overlap at least partially (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This suggests that the destabilisation in vivo might result mostly from the integrity of the pseudoknot fold, but to some degree, the Hfq binding alone may inhibit the degradation of RydC from initiating in single-stranded regions as suggested for other sRNAs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moll et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Saramago et al., 2014</a>)."

Co-crystals of full length <i>E. coli</i> Hfq and <i>Salmonella</i> RydC were obtained that diffracted to 3.48 \u00c5 resolution, and the crystal structure of the RydC\u2013Hfq complex was solved by molecular replacement using a model of the structured hexameric core of <i>E. coli</i> Hfq (i.e., lacking the C-terminal residues beyond amino acid 65). Unbiased, interpretable density for the RNA was apparent in the early maps calculated from the positioned protein hexamer, and a model for most of RydC could be fitted into the electron density (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> shows a map in which the RNA was omitted from the refinement and phase calculations). As the crystal structure is limited to a resolution of 3.48 \u00c5, the map does not provide unequivocal alignment of RydC sequence with structure; however, the path of the majority of the RNA and the duplex regions could be modelled confidently. The asymmetric unit of the crystal comprises one full Hfq hexamer and one RydC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The fold of the RydC is consistent with the pseudoknot structure predicted from solution studies and sequence alignments (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fr\u00f6hlich et al., 2013</a>). The RNA bridges two adjacent Hfq hexamers in the crystal lattice, effectively forming a distorted sandwich with a wedge-shape (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The 3\u2032-end of the RNA interacts with the proximal face of the principle hexamer, while the 5\u2032-end interacts with the upper portion of the lateral surface of another hexamer in the asymmetric unit (see below for details, paragraph \u2018<i>Interactions of RydC with the lateral surface of Hfq</i>\u2019)."

However, solution studies using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALS) indicate that the RydC can form a stable 1:1 complex with the Hfq hexamer under various buffer conditions when the components are present in unitary stoichiometry (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20133</a>). When Hfq is present at twice the concentration of RydC under low ionic strength conditions, some 2:1 Hfq:RydC species can be identified; moreover, a higher order complex can be observed by electrophoretic mobility shifts when Hfq is in excess over RNA (results not shown). These observations suggest that the stoichiometry of Hfq/RNA complexes is very sensitive to solution conditions. In vivo, it seems unlikely that one RydC can find two Hfq hexamers when the protein is limiting to total RNA (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wagner, 2013</a>), and we suggest that the 1:1 complex is likely to represent the physiologically relevant species. We propose that the 2:1 sandwiching complex we observe in the crystal is not the biologically relevant species, but that it encompasses the full set of interactions that would form in a closed 1:1 RydC:Hfq complex. We suggest that the contacts made by RydC with the neighbouring Hfq hexamers can form on the proximal face of the same, single hexamer to form an idealised 1:1 complex. This hypothetical model will be elaborated on further below."

The RydC/Hfq structure reveals that the U-rich tail is bound in a recessed channel on the proximal face of Hfq. The electron density is not well defined in this region, and there may be disorder or multiple conformations of the polyU tail, but the features do show that uridines U61, U62, and U64 (as well as C63) each forms an aromatic base stacking interaction with the ring of F42 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; distances provided in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). K56 forms hydrogen bonds with the O2 group of the uracils, consistent with the importance of this residue in binding RNA on the proximal face (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mikulecky et al., 2004</a>). The model indicates that there are likely to be hydrogen bonds between the uridine bases and Q41 and Q8, as well as between the furanose 2\u2032 OH group with the imidazole group of H57. These interactions are consistent with the crystal structure of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium Hfq/polyU (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sauer and Weichenrieder, 2011</a>; PDB code 2YLC) and with fluorescence quenching experiments for binding U<sub>6</sub> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Robinson et al., 2013</a>). Similar interactions are seen in the crystal structure of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> Hfq in complex with AUUUUUG (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schumacher et al., 2002</a>; PDB code 1KQ2) and <i>E. coli</i> Hfq in complex with AUUUUUA (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2013</a>; PDB code 4HT9). In principle, the RNA can visit each of the uridine pockets following a clockwise or counter-clockwise path, but the polarity seems to be consistently clockwise in the reference frame that views the proximal face. The RNA exits the groove to engage on the rim of the proximal face of Hfq through numerous interactions with protein side- and main-chain atoms, as we describe further below."

To address the function of the highly conserved U residues, three mutant variants of RydC were constructed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). RydC-LI (U23G U24C), RydC-LII (U46C U47G), as well as RydC-LI/II (U23G U24C U46C U47G) were expressed from a constitutive promoter in wild-type <i>Salmonella</i> cells, and RNA stability was assessed by rifampicin treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Compared to wild-type RydC (t<sub>1/2</sub> \u223c32 min), mutant RydC-LII had a reduced half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub> \u223c11 min). Both variants RydC-LI and the double mutant RydC-LI/LII were even less stable (t<sub>1/2</sub> \u223c2 min) and especially the RydC-LI and RydC-LI/LII variants were less potent than the wild-type to regulate the reporter target Cfa\u2013GFP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The discrepancy between steady-state levels and regulatory potential observed between the different RydC variants could be the result of alternative binding patterns via LI and LII leading to changes in RNA orientation on Hfq. Thus, while functional conclusions may be limited at this point, our in vivo data suggest a requirement of the conserved U pairs in the loops of the RydC pseudoknot structure for RNA stability and indicate a functional importance for the interactions observed in the crystal structure of the complex."

Based on results from in vivo crosslinking and RNA sequencing from enterohemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i>, it has been proposed that the consensus Hfq binding site on many sRNAs includes a U\u2013U dinucleotide associated with an unpaired region (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tree et al., 2014</a>). Our results are consistent with this prediction and provide a structural rationalisation: the unpaired region is required to engage the U\u2013U step on the rim. Interactions with the rim may account for the capacity of longer U-tracts to bind Hfq more strongly (<a href=\"#bib31\">Murina et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Panja et al., 2013</a>), since these are anticipated to bridge between the rim and the 3\u2032-polyU-binding pore.

For most of the Hfq subunits in the crystal structure studied here, the C-terminal regions beyond residue 77 are disordered, but broken density in the vicinity is likely to be due to multiple conformations of the C-terminal region. These regions make consolidating interactions with the RNA and appear to be distributed over the exposed surfaces of the nucleic acid. A structural condensation of the C-terminal domains with sRNA binding is also consistent with data from X-ray and neutron solution scattering (<a href=\"#bib17\">Henderson et al., 2013</a>). Both the structural data as well as in vivo experiments suggest that the C-terminal end of Hfq contributes to the association with RydC. The distributive interactions of the C-terminal domain are not expected to provide specificity to the recognition but may enhance the stability of equilibrium complexes as well as boosting the association rates by increasing the effective molecular encounter radius. The distributive interaction may account for the finding that deletion of the C-terminal extension decreases binding to mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ve\u010derek et al., 2008</a>) and that the C-terminal tail can bind to some RNA species (<a href=\"#bib43\">Robinson et al., 2013</a>).

Similar to several orthologues of various bacterial species, Hfq of the archaeon <i>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</i> lacks the unstructured C-terminus. <i>M. jannaschii Hfq</i> is generally able to complement a <i>Salmonella hfq</i> null mutant; however, the distribution of associated sRNAs recovered from pull-down experiments varies greatly compared to the wild-type. While a number of <i>Salmonella</i> sRNAs (including, for example, the Hfq-dependent SroC, InvR, and GcvB) are not reduced in their cellular abundance, a second class of sRNAs is strongly affected by the absence of the C-terminal end. This latter group includes RydC and also several sRNAs highly abundant in the wild-type (e.g., RprA, SdsR, and ArcZ), and it is tempting to speculate that this subpopulation of sRNAs is associated with Hfq through supporting interactions with the C-terminal tail. The differing roles of the tails for different sRNAs may account for the apparently conflicting results reported in the literature on the effects of the C-terminus on sRNA binding and activity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Olsen et al., 2010</a>)<i>.</i> Finally, it should be noted that the C-terminal tails have different lengths in different Hfq homologs, and it is likely that their role differs in different species (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vincent et al., 2012</a>)."

We envisage that these interactions would help to keep the sRNA and mRNA in proximity without constraining them, so that the mRNA might travel along the distal face while the sRNA was held in a more fixed conformation on the proximal face. In this way, the complex can glide along an mRNA until the seed and target region meet. Once this occurs, they will close like a zipper to form a short duplex that could be engaged on the convex rim of the Hfq. The mismatch of molecular symmetries and the high flexibility of both the N- and C-termini of Hfq ensure that the complex will be intrinsically heterogeneous in conformation, but highly dynamic."

The model shares some similarity to the schematic proposed by <a href=\"#bib36\">Panja et al. (2013)</a> and predicts that the 5\u2032 seed will be exposed and available for interaction with the target to form a duplex region that binds to the convex rim of the Hfq hexamer. We envisage that a different model will be required to explain the interactions of sRNA using recognition regions that are internal and not in the 5\u2032 seed. One prediction is that the base-pairing sites in this group of sRNAs will be presented near the rim of Hfq. This model awaits testing."

The authors suggest that the contacts seen on neighboring hexamers can also form on a single one, and that such single interaction is likely to be the functional complex. A clearer discussion of what interacts with each hexamer would at least clarify whether there are mutational tests that might demonstrate the importance of each type of interaction. Related to this point, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> is the only figure that provides a picture of the whole structure and therefore is important for readers to understand the major conclusions, as well as the nature of the complex with two Hfq hexamers. It might be easier to understand this if the second RydC (at upper right) in 2b were in a different shade, for instance (lighter), and possibly if a schematic were included to make it clear what is going on (what the contacts are on each proximal face). Highlighting in some fashion (maybe box and expand to the side) the rim interaction region is important in trying to understand the implications of this sandwiched structure for the rim interaction. It is hard to read the label in some cases. Is the U-rich tail on one hexamer and the 5' end on the other Hfq hexamer? How important is the 5' end for function?"

Our results demonstrate that the affinity for Hfq of the S1 mutant is lower than that of wild type RydC (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a> panel A). The complex formed by RydC with Hfq can only be partially outcompeted in the presence of a 500-fold excess of cold RydC-S1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a> panel B, lanes 1-7). In contrast, RydC-S1/Hfq complexes appeared more susceptible to competition and were already destabilized in the presence of 10-fold excess of unlabelled RydC RNA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a> panel B, lanes 8-14). We conclude that the low in vivo stability of RydC-S1 is likely due to its lower affinity for Hfq and its relatively weak performance in competition for chaperone binding. Additionally, our competition experiments suggest that RydC wild type and S1 mutant share at least an overlapping binding site.

We assume that the lower stability of RydC-S1 is most likely arising from the susceptibility of the RNA to RNase attack when not bound by Hfq. Wild-type RydC is very stable in vivo (t<sub>1/2</sub> &gt; 32\u2019), and its half-life cannot further increase in a temperature sensitive RNase E mutant (rne-ts) compared to the control strain in the course of a 32\u2019 experiment. We do observe an even flatter decay rate though. This suggests that RydC is mostly immune to the action of RNase E when bound to Hfq. In contrast, the half-life of the S1 pseudoknot mutant was increased in the absence of RNase E (from \u223c3 min to \u223c6.5 min), suggesting that the S1 mutant is more susceptible to degradation. However, the S1 mutant is not as stable as wild-type RydC and might be preferentially attacked by other cellular nucleases. Whether this susceptibility is due to an alternative structure or reduced binding capability to Hfq is unclear. We have clarified in the text that both the formation of the pseudoknot and the binding of Hfq may contribute to the in vivo stabilization of RydC."

Our tentative explanation for this is that the assembly rate of LI is sufficiently high to make enough active regulator whereas the LI/II double mutant may be compromised for both assembly and stability, resulting in an intracellular copy number too low for <i>cfa</i> activation. Such effects are difficult to distinguish in vivo and will need the development of a suitable in vitro assay that can separate sRNA decay and activity in a more quantitative fashion. We suggest that LI and LII are both interacting with Hfq, but there might be two alternative binding patterns involving LI or LII. One of the binding options (the one using site LI) is more beneficial for RydC with regard to stability. If interacting via LI RydC is capable of target binding, but also protection by Hfq. If interacting via LII, RydC is still able to interact with <i>cfa</i> but is more susceptible to degradation.
