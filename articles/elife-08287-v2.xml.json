Here we report a novel meiotic gene, v<i>ilya</i>, which encodes a protein with homology to Zip3-like proteins shown to determine DSB fate in other organisms. Vilya is required for meiotic DSB formation, perhaps as a consequence of its interaction with the DSB accessory protein Mei-P22, and localizes to those DSB sites that will mature into crossovers. In early pachytene Vilya localizes along the central region of the synaptonemal complex and to discrete foci. The accumulation of Vilya at foci is dependent on DSB formation. Immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates that Vilya is a component of recombination nodules, which mark the sites of crossover formation. Thus Vilya links the mechanism of DSB formation to either the selection of those DSBs that will become crossovers or to the actual process of crossing over."

Here we report a novel meiotic gene, v<i>ilya</i>, which encodes a protein with homology to Zip3-like proteins shown to determine DSB fate in other organisms. Vilya is required for meiotic DSB formation, perhaps as a consequence of its interaction with the DSB accessory protein Mei-P22, and localizes to those DSB sites that will mature into crossovers. In early pachytene Vilya localizes along the central region of the synaptonemal complex and to discrete foci. The accumulation of Vilya at foci is dependent on DSB formation. Immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates that Vilya is a component of recombination nodules, which mark the sites of crossover formation. Thus Vilya links the mechanism of DSB formation to either the selection of those DSBs that will become crossovers or to the actual process of crossing over."

Then, sections of DNA around the double-strand breaks are exchanged between the matching chromosomes by a process known as crossover.

This is achieved by coupling one round of DNA replication with two rounds of chromosome segregation. During the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes segregate away from each other. At the second (mitosis-like) meiotic division sister chromatids segregate from each other, producing four meiotic products. Successful completion of the first meiotic division requires the proper completion of several key events, each of which must occur at a specific time and place during prophase. For instance, programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs), required for the initiation of meiotic recombination, are spatially and temporally controlled. Failure to initiate recombination, to create the correct number of DSBs, or to position the DSBs properly can lead to aneuploidy (<a href=\"#bib44\">Murakami and Keeney, 2008</a>), which in humans can result in disorders of chromosome number such as Down, Klinefelter, or Turner syndrome."

Crossovers are formed within the context of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved proteinaceous structure formed between homologs during early meiotic prophase (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Page and Hawley, 2004</a>). The SC consists of two lateral elements (LEs) and a central region that contains both the central element (CE) and transverse filament (TF) proteins. Although crossover formation almost universally requires the presence of SC, the degree to which DSB formation depends on SC formation, or vice versa, differs between organisms. In yeast (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roeder, 1997</a>), SC formation is dependent on DSBs, as DSB sites appear to be the location for the initiation of SC synthesis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chua and Roeder, 1998</a>); and in mammals, SC formation between homologs is dependent on DSB formation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baudat et al., 2000</a> <b><a href=\"#bib54\">Romanienko and Camerini-Otero, 2000</a>)</b>.

Moreover, in the absence of SC formation in flies, DSB formation in the oocyte is significantly reduced (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Collins et al., 2014</a>)."

Indeed, the process of DSB formation is tightly controlled, both in terms of DSB number and position. Recently, a feedback mechanism has been proposed that links the process of DSB repair to the DSB formation process in both yeast and worms (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rosu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Thacker et al., 2014</a>).

Therefore, there must be a selection process that differentiates those DSBs that become crossovers from those that will be repaired by processes that create noncrossover gene conversions. Recent studies have identified components of the multistep process that selects those DSBs that will become crossover-competent DSBs. These steps appear to be controlled by the ever-growing Zip3 family of proteins and their regulators."

Recently it has been suggested that there are two subgroups within the Zip3 family: the Zip3/RNF212 group and the Hei10 group (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chelysheva et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">De Muyt et al., 2014</a>). All the members within both subgroups are required for the formation of crossovers and are similar in terms of protein structure; they contain a RING-type zinc finger domain, an internal coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal domain that tends to be serine rich (<a href=\"#bib51\">Reynolds et al., 2013</a>). However, not all organisms possess members of both subgroups. Both budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</a>) and worms (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jantsch et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bhalla et al., 2008</a>) are predicted to carry only a single member of the Zip3/RNF212 group, whereas the Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chelysheva et al., 2012</a>), rice (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2012</a>) and Sordaria (<a href=\"#bib16\">De Muyt et al., 2014</a>) genomes are thought to encode only a member of the Hei10 group.

Zip3/RNF212 group members appear to act solely as SUMO E3 ligases, whereas some members of the Hei10 group appear to possess both ubiquitin E3 ligase and SUMO E3 ligase activity. Yeast Zip3, which is required to regulate SUMO modification along meiotic chromosomes, has SUMO E3 ligase activity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 2006</a>), and genetic studies have implicated Zhp-3, the <i>C. elegans</i> Zip3 homolog, in the SUMO pathway as well (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhalla et al., 2008</a>). Conversely, human Hei10 has been shown biochemically to have ubiquitin E3 ligase activity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib65\">Toby et al., 2003</a>). However, recent studies suggest that mouse Hei10 may also function as a SUMO E3 ligase (<a href=\"#bib59\">Strong and Schimenti, 2010</a>). These observations suggest that the relationship between SUMOylation and ubiquitination of proteins in the vicinity of the DSB determines which DSBs become competent to crossover (<a href=\"#bib50\">Qiao et al., 2014</a>)."

Prior to this study, homologs for most of the proteins required for this process in other organisms (Msh4/Msh5 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yokoo et al., 2012</a>), RNF212, Hei10 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Strong and Schimenti, 2010</a>), Mlh1/Mlh3) had not been identified in Drosophila. In this manuscript we describe a new meiosis-specific gene that we have named <i>vilya</i>. Vilya is a Zip3-like RING-containing protein that is required for programmed DSB formation. Vilya interacts with another DSB accessory protein, Mei-P22, and these proteins localize to sites of DSBs as identified by the chromatin modification \u03b3H2AV (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</a>). When an epitope-tagged version of Vilya is expressed in the female germline, it shows a dynamic localization pattern that is dependent on DSB formation. In early pachytene, Vilya localizes both to the central region of the SC and to discrete foci. As the oocyte matures into early/mid-pachytene, Vilya is primarily found at discrete foci. The number and distribution of these foci along the euchromatic SC of each chromosome arm parallels the number and position of crossover events. Indeed, we show that Vilya is a component of recombination nodules (RNs) by immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM), making it the first RN protein component identified in Drosophila. We speculate that Vilya has functions that have recently been described for several members of the Zip3 group, such as DSB fate determination and crossover formation."

Activation of this checkpoint induces several observable phenotypes, which are bypassed by mutants that fail to form DSBs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ghabrial and Schupbach, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lake et al., 2011</a>). We examined the effect of the <i>vilya</i> mutant on two of these phenotypes. First, in <i>okra</i> mutant-bearing oocytes, the presence of unrepaired breaks leads to sterility (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ghabrial et al., 1998</a>). In <i>vilya<sup>826</sup>/</i>+ oocytes, which carry one wild-type copy of <i>vilya</i>, homozygosity for <i>okra</i> causes near complete sterility, producing only 0.2 progeny per female on average. However, in the <i>vilya<sup>826</sup> okra</i> double mutant, the fertility was similar to <i>vilya<sup>826</sup></i> alone, averaging 14.4 and 16.3 progeny per female, respectively, and the rate of <i>X</i> and <i>4th</i> chromosome nondisjunction in the double mutant was similar to the <i>vilya<sup>826</sup> </i>single mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Therefore, the reduction of DSBs due to the <i>vilya</i> mutation resulted in the rescue of fertility (about 30% as fertile as wild type) caused by the <i>okra</i> mutation. Second, in <i>okra</i> mutant oocytes the presence of unrepaired DSBs results in an inability to form the spherical meiotic chromosome mass, known as the karyosome, in late pachytene (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ghabrial et al., 1998</a>). In the presence of DSBs, but in the absence of repair, the karyosome structure is fragmented (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>vilya<sup>826</sup></i> was also able to rescue the karyosome defect seen in <i>okra</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that DSBs are formed and repaired in a <i>rad54/okra</i>-independent manner so quickly that we are unable to detect them in our assay, these studies strongly support the conclusion that programmed DSBs are rarely formed in <i>vilya<sup>826</sup></i> oocytes."

While a strong correlation between crossover position and the distribution of Vilya foci would strongly support the hypothesis that the establishment of discrete Vilya foci plays a role in crossover formation, the finding of a lack of consistency for the distribution and/or in the position of the foci might indicate the foci are an artifact from using this overexpression system. A summary of the number and distribution of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci from the five early/mid-pachytene nuclei in which we could clearly identify all five SCs between homologous chromosome arms is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>. Examining these five oocyte nuclei, which contain a total of 25 stretches of SC, we observed 24 Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci or an average of 4.8 foci per oocyte. The majority (22/24) of the SC between homologous chromosome arms were associated with only one Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> focus. A small fraction (1/22) contained two foci (corresponding nucleus shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), and 2/22 were not associated with any Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci. These numbers correspond well to the observed distribution of crossovers in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. In addition, as is seen in the images in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C-a,b</a> and corresponding <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci were found exclusively within the euchromatic SC, and no Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci were detected in the less-defined heterochromatic SC. Consistent with this observation we failed to detect any colocalization of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci with the histone variant (CID, the CENP-A homolog) that localizes in the pericentromeric heterochromatin throughout early/mid-pachytene (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus the number of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci in early/mid-pachytene oocytes are consistently found and correspond well to the known number and position of crossover events in flies, with each stretch of euchromatic SC between homologous chromosome arms primarily containing one focus (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lindsley et al., 1977</a>)."

Unlike many model organisms where crossover-specific proteins have been identified and reagents have been made to analyze their localization, no such proteins or reagents exist in Drosophila. However, early studies by Carpenter in Drosophila show that sites of crossovers form large electron-dense structures known as RNs within the central region of the SC (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carpenter, 1975a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carpenter, 1975b</a>)."

For this experiment we chose to use the mutant <i>spnB</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ghabrial et al., 1998</a>), which is located on a separate chromosome from both the expression construct and the germline driver and could easily be combined genetically for this analysis. SpnB, the XRCC3 or Rad51-like protein, is required for programmed DSB repair, and therefore in the absence of <i>spnB</i> function, DSBs fail to be repaired and can be seen by immunofluorescence as \u03b3H2AV foci accumulating in mid-pachytene oocytes (region 3). We find that in the absence of DSB repair, the number of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci in region 3 increases from an average of 3.2 (SD = 0.9) in an otherwise wild-type background (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) to 7.5 (SD = 1.6, n = 10 oocytes).

In addition, similar to the DSB repair-proficient background above, in the absence of DSB repair the frequency of association between Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> and \u03b3H2AV was reduced to 10.6% (8 of the 75 Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci) upon rotation of the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> channel (p &lt; 0.0001, binomial test)."

The SC is not required for the temporal induction of DSBs in nurse cells in early pachytene (see <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), however it is required for wild-type levels of DSB formation in oocytes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</a>). Although it is difficult to distinguish oocyte nuclei from nurse cell nuclei in the absence of <i>c(3)G</i>, occasionally the oocyte can be located by the weak haze of nuclear Corolla staining (<a href=\"#bib14\">Collins et al., 2014</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, we find that in the absence of C(3)G, Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> is able to localize in early pachytene oocytes to discrete foci that are often associated with \u03b3H2AV marks (75% of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci, 34 of 45, colocalize with \u03b3H2AV marks in 14 oocyte nuclei analyzed). As the number of DSBs in oocytes of a <i>c(3)G</i> mutant are reduced to 15\u201320% of normal (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</a>), as expected, Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci are also reduced in number compared to wild type in region 2A (an average of 3.2 Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci per oocyte compared to 8.0 in wild type). Interestingly, we failed to see a persistence of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> in region 2B oocytes that we could identify by Corolla staining. Of the seven region 2B oocytes we analyzed that no longer contained \u03b3H2AV staining, only two had a single Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> focus while the remaining had none. We speculate that the absence of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci at this stage is a consequence of a failure to form RNs and thus repair those DSBs into crossovers. At this time, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the levels of expression of <i>vilya<sup>3XHA</sup></i> using the Gal4-UAS system in the <i>c(3)G</i> mutant is less than in our wild-type background. In addition, we never observed linear Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> staining in the absence of <i>c(3)G</i>, indicating that the SC is required to localize Vilya to the central element but not to DSBs."

As shown in our model (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>), DSBs are not formed in the absence of Mei-P22, Vilya, or Mei-W68 (<i>Dm</i> Spo11), resulting in the absence of crossovers (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</a>) (this study). Unlike Mei-P22, whose localization to discrete foci in early pachytene is not dependent on DSBs (or at least <i>mei-W68</i> function) but is dependent on the SC (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2002</a>), Vilya\u2019s ability to localize to discrete foci appears to require only the formation of DSBs but not the SC. In the absence of either Mei-P22 or Mei-W68, the discrete Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci, which are first apparent in early pachytene and often persist throughout mid-pachytene, do not form. Our studies also suggest that the localization of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> along the central region of the SC is not required for its localization to discrete foci, as we did not detect any linear staining of Vilya in a <i>c(3)G</i> mutant, but we did detect discrete foci often colocalizing with \u03b3H2AV marks (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Therefore, Vilya is not only required for the formation of DSBs, but it\u2019s localization to discrete foci, which can be found at a significant number of DSBs (based on \u03b3H2AV staining), is dependent on DSB formation. Based on these observations, along with the finding that Mei-P22 and Vilya interact in a yeast two-hybrid assay, we propose that Mei-P22 acts upstream of Vilya, and recruits Vilya and Mei-W68, which catalyzes DSBs. Vilya is recruited to at least a subset of DSBs, which are then visualized as discrete foci in early pachytene often colocalizing with \u03b3H2AV marks."

Vilya localizes to the central region of the SC and is required along with its binding partner, Mei-P22, and Mei-W68 (the Spo11 homolog) for formation of DSBs. Although initially Vilya may localize to a vast majority of, if not all, DSBs, as the oocytes mature into early/mid-pachytene, Vilya is retained and/or recruited to form discrete foci at sites of crossing over. Failure to accumulate Vilya at DSB sites would direct that DSB to a noncrossover fate. (Right) In the absence of Mei-P22 or Mei-W68, and thus in the absence of DSB formation, Vilya fails to localize to discrete foci and is found exclusively along the central region of the SC. In the absence of Vilya, we speculate, based on the fact that Mei-P22 can localize to discrete foci in the absence of Mei-W68 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2002</a>), that Mei-P22\u2019s localization is unaffected. However, DSB formation would fail due to the absence of <i>vilya</i> function. In the absence of Mei-W68, Mei-P22 is able to bind normally (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2002</a>), however, due to the absence of DSBs, Vilya does not form discrete foci.

We base this proposal on the observation in budding yeast that the differential enrichment of Zip3 at DSBs positively biases the DSB toward the crossover pathway (<a href=\"#bib56\">Serrentino et al., 2013</a>). We know from our studies that exogenous DSBs have the ability to recruit or concentrate Vilya to a subset of them, in the absence of SC there appears to be a failure to maintain Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> at discrete foci in early/mid-pachytene oocytes, and our immuno-EM analysis of oocytes expressing <i>vilya<sup>3XHA</sup></i> indicate that Vilya is indeed a component of the RN. Together, these data suggest that Vilya plays an active role at the sites of crossing over. Although we do not have direct evidence that Vilya controls DSB fate by promoting crossover maturation, our demonstration that Vilya is recruited to the sites of DSBs in a similar number and position to that of RNs strongly supports this hypothesis."

Here, we show in <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> the sequence alignment of Vilya to Zip3 homologs of selected plants, fungi, worms, and vertebrates. These selected sequences were used to generate a maximum likelihood tree to show the relationship of Vilya to these homologs (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Consistent with the BLAST similarity network findings of Chelysheva et al. (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chelysheva et al., 2012</a>), two groups could be identified. One contains the Hei10-like homologs of plants, fungi and vertebrates; and one contains the Zip3-like members including Zip3, Zhp-3 and RNF212. This analysis suggests that evolutionarily Vilya is more closely related to the Zip3-like members than Hei10 members. In addition, based on predicted protein structure and domains, there is an overall similarity between members within the Zip3 group members and Vilya. These similarities include an N-terminal RING domain (see <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which predicts E3 ligase activity, an internal coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal serine-rich domain, which many Zip3 members possess (<a href=\"#bib51\">Reynolds et al., 2013</a>).

Studies in Sordaria have shown that the RXL motif of Hei10, along with the RING domain, are required to modulate the levels of SUMOylation along the SC (<a href=\"#bib16\">De Muyt et al., 2014</a>). Although we have not specifically determined whether the SUMO-IM and RXL motifs in Vilya are required for its function, in preliminary studies we have not been able to detect an interaction between Vilya and the Drosophila Ubc9 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Nor have we been able to identify SUMOylation of proteins at the SC in Drosophila oocytes using an antibody to Drosophila SUMO (Abgent AP1287b, San Diego, CA). Therefore, although structurally Vilya bears a strong resemblance to the Zip3 family, we have no evidence Vilya possess SUMO E3 ligase activity, interacts directly with an E2 enzyme, or that SUMOylation plays a role at the SC in Drosophila at this time."

As the oocyte progresses into early/mid pachytene, the discrete foci predominate and the signal along the central region of the SC appears to diminish (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In oocytes that have progressed past mid-pachytene, the discrete foci disappear and the signal along the central region becomes uniform (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). This dynamic localization is unlikely to be a result of the overexpression system we are using because in this same system in the absence of meiotic recombination initiation we fail to observe this pattern and only linear central region staining is present. Moreover, similar dynamic localization patterns have been seen for <i>C. elegans</i> Zhp-3, mouse RNF212, and Arabidopsis and rice Hei10 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jantsch et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bhalla et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chelysheva et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Reynolds et al., 2013</a>). The general dynamic trend seems to begin with the localization along the SC as continuous linear tracks or arrays of discrete foci, and culminates with localization at discrete foci that mark the sites of crossing over. In the absence of meiotic recombination initiation in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhalla et al., 2008</a>) and mice (<a href=\"#bib51\">Reynolds et al., 2013</a>), Zhp-3 and RNF212, respectively, were also found to localize along the SC, albeit the SC of nonhomologous chromosomes in mice, and failed to coalesce into discrete foci. However, we cannot rule out that the reappearance of Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> to the central region of the SC in late pachytene is not a consequence of this ectopic expression since we have not discerned a later function for Vilya."

For example, Zip3 in budding yeast appears to be the only member required for SC assembly (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bhalla et al., 2008</a>), and Hei10 in Sordaria is uniquely required for processes involving spindle pole body dynamics (<a href=\"#bib16\">De Muyt et al., 2014</a>). Because DSB accessory proteins are highly divergent and Drosophila appear to lack homologs of the meiosis-specific MutS complex (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yokoo et al., 2012</a>), which are required to stabilize strand invasion during crossing over, and the crossover-specific complex MutL\u03b3, to which Zip3 family members bind, perhaps then it is not surprising that Drosophila has found an unique way to couple the events of DSB formation to those of crossing over."

We recorded the percent transmission (which stayed consistent) and exposure time in each channel for each of the acquired images. We averaged the five exposure times for each filter. We fixed these as values for our wild-type image acquisition. The images were then deconvolved as above. In addition, we recorded the exposure time on wild type for each of the filters when using a target intensity value of 3000. These were then averaged as before and compared to the averages of <i>vilya<sup>3XHA</sup></i>-expressing tissue as a ratio of average exposure time in <i>vilya<sup>3XHA</sup></i>-expressing ovaries to average exposure time in wild type. For the DAPI the ratio was 1.0:0.9, TRITC (HA) 1.0:5.78 and Cy5 (Corolla) 1.0:1.2.

We then rotated the images in 3D to verify that the \u03b3H2AV signal was not simply above or below the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> focus. We scored those signals that overlapped, as well as those signals that were adjacent (no apparent gap between the foci), but not separated above or below in 3D, as being associated. To verify the relevance of their association, we took each 3D cropped oocyte nucleus and rotated the channel for the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci by 180 degrees using ImageJ software. First, we split each of the channels of the image. We selected the channel with the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci, and used the transform function to flip the z-series horizontally. We then used the stack tool to reverse the stack. Together these two manipulations are equivalent to a 180 degree rotation of the Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> channel. After merging the channels back together, we again analyzed the association of \u03b3H2AV and Vilya<sup>3XHA</sup> foci as before."

The use of \u00ce\u00b3H2AV antibody developed in an earlier study (Lake et al., 2013) has allowed the authors to quantify DSB formation and conclude that a truncation of the Vilya gene causes defect in DSB formation. The protein shares some features characteristic of the yeast Zip3 protein family, important for crossover designation. Vilya interacts with the DSB accessory protein Mei-P22, is localized in oocytes along the synaptonemal complex, and forms foci that appear to be recombination nodules by electron microscopy. Altogether, the results suggest that Vilya plays an important role in DSB formation and/or repair, and help to provide a more complete model of meiotic recombination pathway in <i>Drosophila</i> females, where several recombination factors well conserved among eukaryotes appear to be absent."

It would be better to use more nuanced language: This experiment suggests a failure or a strong reduction, and the resolution of the picture does not allow for the conclusion \"complete\" failure. What is the estimated limit of sensitivity of the gH2AV staining? The data of the recombination map is clear but if Vilya is required for CO, then some remaining DSB could be repaired to NCO in the mutant."

We also have been very aware to use throughout the manuscript the 3XHA reference when discussing the localization of Vilya, as to remind the reader this is a tagged overexpressed construct. We have included in the manuscript caveats to using an overexpression construct for certain experiments as well."

These nurse cells synthesize both protein and RNAs, which are dumped into the oocyte. We would be unable to determine whether a certain level of increase in mRNA resulted in that level of protein expression, as well due to the inability to isolate germarium, we are unable to look at expression levels specifically in the area of the ovary we are studying in this manuscript."
