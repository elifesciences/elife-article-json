Here we discern the functional architecture of human NELF through X-ray crystallography, protein crosslinking, biochemical assays, and RNA crosslinking in cells. We identify a NELF core subcomplex formed by conserved regions in subunits NELF-A and NELF-C, and resolve its crystal structure. The NELF-AC subcomplex binds single-stranded nucleic acids <i>in vitro</i>, and NELF-C associates with RNA <i>in vivo</i>. A positively charged face of NELF-AC is involved in RNA binding, whereas the opposite face of the NELF-AC subcomplex binds NELF-B. NELF-B is predicted to form a HEAT repeat fold, also binds RNA <i>in vivo</i>, and anchors the subunit NELF-E, which is confirmed to bind RNA <i>in vivo</i>. These results reveal the three-dimensional architecture and three RNA-binding faces of NELF."
