If two variables, say A and B, are correlated, it could be because A causes B, or that B causes A, or because a third factor affects them both. We suggest that in many cases in biology, the causal link might be bi-directional: A causes B through a fast-acting physiological process, while B causes A through a slowly accumulating evolutionary process. Furthermore, many trained biologists tend to consistently focus at first on the fast-acting direction, and overlook the slower process in the opposite direction. We analyse several examples from modern biology that demonstrate this bias (codon usage optimality and gene expression, gene duplication and genetic dispensability, stem cell division and cancer risk, and the microbiome and host metabolism) and also discuss an example from linguistics. These examples demonstrate mutual effects between the fast physiological processes and the slow evolutionary ones. We believe that building awareness of inference biases among biologists who tend to prefer one causal direction over another could improve scientific reasoning."

A great conceptual challenge, which often triggers intense arguments, is to decipher the nature of causal links that underlie these observations. It seems to us that biologists tend to interpret causation in a way that reflects their education and other biases, often noticing at first the proximate cause. We follow with a few examples of biological questions in which the direction of a causal link (physiological or evolutionary) has been, or could have been, debated. In each example we describe how a physiological causal link (\u201cA causes B\u201d) could account for an observed correlation, but also how the opposite causal direction (\u201cB causes A\u201d), which takes\u00a0place over an evolutionary time scale, can and perhaps should be invoked. We conclude with a discussion on the interaction between the fast-acting and slow-acting effects in biology and ask why biologists might intuitively focus on one effect over another."

Scientists who wish to overexpress a gene in a heterologous system know that they need to \u201ccodon-optimize\u201d their gene. That is to say, they must alter its coding sequence so that it is the best match for the codon usage of the most highly expressed genes in the host genome. These are often the codons that correspond to abundant tRNAs in that species. Indeed the effects of codon optimization of gene expression are most pronounced in heterologous expression systems (see <a href=\"#bib6\">Gustafsson et al., 2004</a>). Yet also for the natural genes in a genome, the most codon-optimized genes are often most highly used and expressed (<a href=\"#bib20\">Sharp and Li, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Man and Pilpel, 2007</a>). This may lead to the conclusion that optimal codon usage is a cause of high protein expression for natural genes too.

There is circumstantial evidence that serves to provide support for this notion. For example, native speakers of the Pirah\u00e3 language, which does not have names for numbers above two, perform relatively poorly in simple counting tasks (<a href=\"#bib3\">Everett, 2005</a>); natives of languages in which directions are absolute (\u201csouth\u201d, \u201cnorth,\u201d \u201ceast\u201d and \u201cwest\u201d) rather than relative (\u201cright\u201d or \u201cleft\u201d) navigate better (<a href=\"#bib1\">Boroditsky, 2011</a>); and natives of languages such as Russian, in which different shades of blue have different names, can distinguish between such colours more easily (<a href=\"#bib23\">Winawer et al., 2007</a>).

The putative effect of perception on language would necessarily take place over an evolutionary time scale, while effects of language on perception would occur during our life span as we acquire a language. For example, is it possible that the language of the Aboriginal group Kuuk Thaayorre, which uses absolute directions, was shaped in its rather peculiar way because absolute directions were more evolutionarily critical than relative directions in that culture? That is, maybe this group, to which navigation through absolute directions comes naturally, survived better over the years, and their language simply reflects their natural inclinations. Likewise, the different names for shades of blue in Russian might reflect a peculiarity in the\u00a0genes\u00a0that determine colour vision in the Russian population. Although we will leave the resolution of this general dispute to the linguists, it is interesting to notice that, in this example too, the observed correlation between language and perception might be interpreted as indicating a bi-directional causal link."

Curiously, the slower-acting potential effect that requires involvement of evolutionary processes was less intuitive, albeit typically not to evolutionary biologists. We note though that under certain conditions a bi-directional effect, both physiological and evolutionary might be at work. In particular, consider again A and B as two characteristics of an organism. First, suppose that B is a characteristic that increases an organism\u2019s fitness (e.g. high expression of a gene). Second, suppose that the organism can display B without the characteristic A (e.g. high codon optimality of that gene), but that A makes B more efficient. Then, after a long evolutionary process, we would expect the organism to develop a mechanism in which B is established through the means of A. This means that the effect \u201cB causes A\u201d depends on the existing effect \u201cA causes B\u201d. For example, evolution likely selected for high codon optimality of highly expressed genes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kudla et al., 2009</a>).
