This phenomenon can lead to deleterious rearrangements, but also genetic novelty, and many questions regarding its genesis, fate and evolutionary role remain unanswered. Here, we describe extreme chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination, a process resulting from hybridization of <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants expressing different centromere histones H3. Shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single, laggard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucleus. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or stalled fork repair. Furthermore, mutation of required NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. Lastly, heritability and stability of a rearranged chromosome suggest a potential for enduring genomic novelty. These findings provide a tractable, natural system towards investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders."

This phenomenon can lead to deleterious rearrangements, but also genetic novelty, and many questions regarding its genesis, fate and evolutionary role remain unanswered. Here, we describe extreme chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination, a process resulting from hybridization of <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants expressing different centromere histones H3. Shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single, laggard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucleus. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or stalled fork repair. Furthermore, mutation of required NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. Lastly, heritability and stability of a rearranged chromosome suggest a potential for enduring genomic novelty. These findings provide a tractable, natural system towards investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders."

In nature, similar phenomena involve defective CENH3 loading (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sanei et al., 2011</a>). Thus, mating of individuals that express diverged CENH3s, can lead to mitotic catastrophe."

Missegregated chromosomes can lead to aneuploidy (<a href=\"#bib13\">Janssen et al., 2011</a>), but also to extensive and catastrophic restructuring resulting in, sequentially, chromosome sequestration in micronuclei, endonucleolytic damage, defective repair, and finally rescue (<a href=\"#bib4\">Crasta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Hatch et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>).

Nevertheless, chromosomal rearrangements are not necessarily deleterious: some may influence fitness by altering recombination or gene dosage (<a href=\"#bib2\">Comai et al., 2003</a>). It is possible that pathways leading to disease and to diversity share a common mechanistic basis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Genome elimination in <i>Arabidopsis</i> provides a previously lacking organismal system to investigate genome instability during mitotic catastrophes, connected mechanisms, and consequences."

                        "text": "We used the <i>GFP</i>-tailswap haploid inducer (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ravi and Chan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ravi et al., 2014</a>) in the experimental setup illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. This strain is in the Col-0 background and carries a homozygous <i>CENH3</i> null mutation whose function is partially complemented by a chimeric CENH3 in which an N-terminal <i>GFP</i> fused to the H3.3-like N-terminal tail replaces the native CENH3 N-terminal tail. We crossed this strain to polymorphic accession L<i>er gl1-1</i> to track haplotypes in the F1 progeny and obtained the expected haploid induction frequency (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ravi and Chan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ravi et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The recessive <i>gl1-1</i> mutation confers trichomeless leaves in paternal L<i>er gl1-1</i> haploids while it is masked in Col/L<i>er</i> diploid hybrids. We sequenced 10 of the phenotypically diploid Col/L<i>er</i> individuals with wild-type phenotype, performed dosage plot and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and found that 100% of these were diploid with 50% Col and L<i>er</i> genomes respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Plants from the aneuploid class exhibited multiple pleiotropic and morphological defects and had trichomes, except in the rare exception when the <i>GL1</i> locus was lost. The five recognizable primary trisomic (2n + 1) phenotypes were represented (<a href=\"#bib31\">Steinitz-Sears, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Koornneef and Vanderveen, 1983</a>): Chromosome 1 (Chr1) trisomics have dark green, serrated leaves and are dwarfed, Chr2 trisomics exhibit round leaves and are late flowering, Chr3 trisomics have narrow, yellow green leaves, Chr4 trisomics display narrow and smaller flat leaves, and Chr5 trisomics display light green and narrow leaves. However, aneuploid plants with more severe or unusual phenotypes were also observed, suggestive of other chromosomal combinations or more serious chromosomal aberrations. Chromosome dosage analysis based on whole genome sequencing (<a href=\"#bib11\">Henry et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) distinguished three chromosomal alteration types in aneuploids (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Similar outcomes were obtained using independently derived haploid inducers, either expressing <i>GFP</i>-tailswap (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) or CENH3 from other plant species (<a href=\"#bib22\">Maheshwari et al., 2015</a>). The most common type, numerical aneuploids, display whole chromosome aneuploidy such as in the classical primary trisomics (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> shows an example for a numerical Chr3). In our dataset, single primary trisomics (2n + 1) account for 75% of the numerical class. Other individuals from the numerical class with two or more extra whole chromosomes included 16% double primary trisomics (2n + 1 + 1), 2% triple primary trisomics (2n + 1 + 1 + 1) and 3% quadruple primary trisomics (2n + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1). Additionally, we obtained disomic Chr4 haploids (n + 1, a type of numerical aneuploidy that were not included in this analysis) as well as Chr2 or Chr3 monosomic diploids (2n \u2212 1) at 4% frequency (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These have never been described in <i>Arabidopsis</i> before<i>,</i> possibly because, if they were to arise from meiotic defects, they would result from nullisomic gametes, which are not viable (<a href=\"#bib10\">Henry et al., 2009</a>). Aneuploids resulting from mitotic failure do not have those constraints."

In the third class, a single chromosome exhibited many oscillations in copy number state, as if shattered and subsequently rearranged (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> shows an example of shattered Chr3). This shattered class was found to occur in 11% of the aneuploid population. Additionally, some of the aneuploids exhibited a combination of numerical, truncated and shattered chromosome types (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Alteration of copy number for Chr1, 2 and 3 are represented at similar frequencies based on the average copy number alteration of all five chromosomes, with Chr4 and 5 alterations being, respectively, over- and under-represented (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This may be explained by the uneven distribution between chromosomes of few, selected genes that are highly dosage-sensitive. According to this hypothesis, Chr4 would be selectively depleted for such genes."

Duplicated and triplicated blocks could therefore, have different origins. To address this question, we asked whether breakpoint junctions of the two different copy number states display differential association to various genomic and chromatin features such as genes and repeated elements (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lamesch et al., 2012</a>), DNA replication origins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Costas et al., 2011</a>), DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) and nine non-overlapping chromatin states that partition the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5</a>). When analyzing windows of 1000 bp centered around the breakpoints of duplicated blocks, we observed an enrichment in genic DNA (from 53% background level to 70%, p &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,F</a>). A subtler, but still significant, increase was observed when using larger windows (10,000 bp , from 53% background level to 62%, p &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Consistently, 42% of breakpoint junctions from FRAG00062 are predicted to generate chimeric gene products (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). In the same analysis, we noted that the breakpoint regions of duplicated and triplicated blocks contained some genomic features that differed in frequency. In particular, replication origins, which occupy less than 1% of 10,000 bp windows around the borders of duplicated blocks, are present in almost 8% around the borders of triplicated blocks (compared to a genome average of 3.5%, p &lt; 0.05, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>). The association of the breakpoints flanking duplicated DNA to genic DNA and of those flanking triplicated DNA to replication origins suggests the contribution of two distinct mechanisms to restructuring of the same chromosome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The first, chromothripsis acting through breakage and ligation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Stephens et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Korbel and Campbell, 2013</a>).

In many cases, the chromosomes marked by the variant CENH3 missegregate in the embryo and are compartmentalized in micronuclei. DNA damage, NHEJ repair and restitution of the micronucleus to the euploid pole nucleus can result in aneuploidy or diploidy. Alternatively, shattered chromosomes result from chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis. The former involves fragmentation and random ligation, the latter replication fork collapse and microhomology-mediated strand switching. As a consequence, the pulverized and reassembled chromosome forms a single unit and can be meiotically inherited. The schematics for chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis are shown sequentially for convenience, but their order has not been determined. In addition, our results obtained using <i>DNA ligase4-2</i> mutants suggest that the NHEJ pathway plays an important role in the repair of the haploid inducer chromosomes that contribute to diploid and aneuploid progeny, such that when NHEJ is inhibited, haploid induction frequency increased."

To test this explanation, we created a haploid inducer carrying a homozygous null mutation in <i>LIG4</i> (DNA Ligase IV), a conserved component of the canonical NHEJ pathway. Pollinating it with wild-type <i>LIG4/LIG4</i> pollen (from L<i>er gl1-1</i>) resulted in normal haploid induction frequencies. However, when mutant <i>lig4-2/lig4-2</i> pollen was used, the frequency of haploids doubled at the expense of aneuploids and diploids (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This effect was still observed when the seed parent carried the WT allele (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). It is possible that parental-specific haploinsufficiency results from early loss of the wild-type <i>LIG4</i> allele located on the chromosome targeted for elimination, which in this case is the maternal chromosome. This result indicates that NHEJ contributes to formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny and that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase elimination of the haploid inducer genome, similar to observations in mouse-human hybrid genome elimination (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). We hypothesize that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks. Occasionally, such chromosomes are rescued (i.e., restituted to a haploid or diploid nucleus) through a pathway requiring NHEJ, resulting in aneuploidy. Therefore, more haploids are produced when the NHEJ pathway is impaired (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

This phenomenon studied here depends on chimeric CENH3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species (<a href=\"#bib22\">Maheshwari et al., 2015</a>), indicating the effectiveness of natural and artificial variation. While the genesis and fate of restructured chromosomes is difficult to study in humans, their formation, effects, and even transmission in <i>Arabidopsis</i> are within experimental reach, as demonstrated by the enhancing effect of NHEJ mutants on haploid induction. The range of phenotypes, the formation of copy variants and of chimeric genes at junctions, and their occasional meiotic transmission, suggest that catastrophic chromosomal restructuring, could contribute to heritable genetic variation."

These sequences were then assembled using the PRICE genome assembler using the standard paired-end assembly setting (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ruby et al., 2013</a>). Resulting contigs were aligned to the <i>Arabidopsis</i> reference genome by NCBI-BLASTN and characteristic breakpoint junctions were identified when two halves of a contig mapped disconcordantly to the reference genome. Primers flanking 12 randomly selected breakpoint junctions were designed using Primer3 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>) based on their respective de novo assembled contigs. Standard PCR procedures were used for amplification using oligo pairs (<a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 8</a>) and GoTaq Green Mastermix (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) on 1 ng DNA from FRAG00062 and FRAG00080 (a diploid sibling control) followed by Sanger sequencing."

The GFF file containing the location of mapped replication origins was available from a study by <a href=\"#bib3\">Costas et al., (2011)</a>.

Specifically, window sizes of either 1000 or 10,000 bp were centered on each breakpoint coordinate, and the number of bp contributed by each feature of interest were summed across all windows. We also calculated the number of bp contributed by each feature outside those windows."

Although this particular study principally involves <i>GFP</i>-tailswap haploid-inducer lines, it has clear relevance to general biological phenomena resulting from hybridization of related species and aneuploidy. The authors have used cytogenetics complemented by a NGS approach to carry out a clear and coherent analysis of chromosome elimination and reorganization at the genome-wide level in these plants. This is a most interesting paper that follows up on a recent PLoS Genetics paper that showed that crossing plants with differing CENH3 N-terminal tails frequently resulted in genome instability. The present paper extends these studies and definitively analyzes the nature of the chromosome shattering, showing that the instability most likely arises in post-meiotic mitoses and likely most involves two different processes are implicated."
