The light-gated Channelrhodopsin has been widely used to study and manipulate neuronal activity in vivo, whereas optogenetic control of second messengers in vivo has not been examined in depth. In this study, we present a transgenic mouse model expressing a photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (bPAC) in sperm. In transgenic sperm, bPAC mimics the action of the endogenous soluble adenylyl cyclase (SACY) that is required for motility and fertilization: light-stimulation rapidly elevates cAMP, accelerates the flagellar beat, and, thereby, changes swimming behavior of sperm. Furthermore, bPAC replaces endogenous adenylyl cyclase activity. In mutant sperm lacking the bicarbonate-stimulated SACY activity, bPAC restored motility after light-stimulation and, thereby, enabled sperm to fertilize oocytes in vitro. We show that optogenetic control of cAMP in vivo allows to non-invasively study cAMP signaling, to control behaviors of single cells, and to restore a fundamental biological process such as fertilization."

The light-gated Channelrhodopsin has been widely used to study and manipulate neuronal activity in vivo, whereas optogenetic control of second messengers in vivo has not been examined in depth. In this study, we present a transgenic mouse model expressing a photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (bPAC) in sperm. In transgenic sperm, bPAC mimics the action of the endogenous soluble adenylyl cyclase (SACY) that is required for motility and fertilization: light-stimulation rapidly elevates cAMP, accelerates the flagellar beat, and, thereby, changes swimming behavior of sperm. Furthermore, bPAC replaces endogenous adenylyl cyclase activity. In mutant sperm lacking the bicarbonate-stimulated SACY activity, bPAC restored motility after light-stimulation and, thereby, enabled sperm to fertilize oocytes in vitro. We show that optogenetic control of cAMP in vivo allows to non-invasively study cAMP signaling, to control behaviors of single cells, and to restore a fundamental biological process such as fertilization."

Cyclic AMP signaling is essential for sperm development, motility, and maturation in the female genital tract (<a href=\"#bib37\">Visconti et al., 1995b</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wennemuth et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kr\u00e4hling et al., 2013</a>). However, the underlying signaling pathways are not well understood. CRIS, a cAMP-binding protein, controls spermatogenesis and sperm motility (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kr\u00e4hling et al., 2013</a>). An increase in bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) during the transit from the epididymis to the female genital tract activates a soluble adenylyl cyclase (SACY) and, thereby, accelerates the flagellar beat and enhances progressive sperm motility (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esposito et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Xie et al., 2006</a>). HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-induced cAMP synthesis by SACY stimulates protein kinase A (PKA) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wennemuth et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Nolan et al., 2004</a>) and controls capacitation, a maturation process of sperm in the female genital tract that is essential for fertilization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang, 1951</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Austin, 1952</a>). Acceleration of the flagellar beat and capacitation proceed on quite different time scales: the beat frequency increases within seconds, whereas PKA-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, a hallmark of sperm capacitation, takes about an hour to become noticeable (<a href=\"#bib36\">Visconti et al., 1995a</a>)."

Previous attempts to delineate these signaling pathways relied on common pharmacological tools: membrane-permeable cAMP analogs and modulators of cAMP signaling components (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kobori et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xia et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wertheimer et al., 2013</a>). Recent studies in human sperm, however, refute that cAMP controls [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Str\u00fcnker et al., 2011</a>) and disclose serious shortcomings of these pharmacological tools that directly act on the sperm Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel CatSper and, thereby, artifactually change Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brenker et al., 2012</a>).

We show that bPAC mimics the action of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> in sperm. Furthermore, bPAC functionally replaces the endogenous SACY activity and remedies cAMP signaling defects, demonstrating that in vitro, fertility can be restored by optogenetics. Finally, an increase of cAMP levels by light does not elevate Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in sperm. Thus, the Prm1-bPAC mouse model is a powerful tool to analyze cAMP-dependent signaling in ciliary structures with high spatio-temporal resolution uncompromised by pharmacological artifacts."

The basal beat frequency of bPAC sperm was slightly lower compared to wild-type sperm (5.5 \u00b1 2.5 Hz versus 8.0 \u00b1 3.7 Hz; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), which might be due to a cAMP-dependent feedback mechanism activated by elevated basal cAMP levels (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burton and McKnight, 2007</a>). Light stimulation of bPAC sperm evoked a transient acceleration of the flagellar beat: a 200-ms light pulse increased the beat frequency within 10 s about 2.5-fold from 7 Hz to 18 Hz (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1,2</a>). The acceleration persisted for at least 10 s and sperm returned to basal beat frequency within 30 s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). The light-stimulated acceleration of the flagellar beat was dose-dependent: the longer the light exposure, the faster the onset and higher the beat frequency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I,J</a>). Local illumination of a small part of the flagellum also enhanced the beat frequency, albeit the increase was smaller and its kinetics slower compared to global illumination (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3,4</a>). Altogether, we conclude that (1) light activation of bPAC mimics the transient beat acceleration evoked by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> stimulation of SACY (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wennemuth et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carlson et al., 2007</a>), (2) the behavioral response of single cells can be modulated in a graded fashion, and that (3) bPAC is able to control cAMP signaling in the sperm flagellum with spatial precision."

To scrutinize our experimental conditions, we determined sperm cAMP levels before and after activation of bPAC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We observed that cAMP synthesis via light stimulation of bPAC did not evoke a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>), consistent with the observation that a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-induced cAMP increase does not affect [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in mouse (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wennemuth et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carlson et al., 2007</a>) and human sperm (<a href=\"#bib35\">Str\u00fcnker et al., 2011</a>).

                                "text": "The loss of SACY function abolishes cAMP signaling in sperm, rendering sperm immotile and resulting in male infertility (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esposito et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Xie et al., 2006</a>). We explored the potential of optogenetics to compensate for the functional loss of SACY. Removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> attenuated HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-induced cAMP synthesis by SACY (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jaiswal and Conti, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carlson et al., 2007</a>). Thereby, tyrosine phosphorylation in wild-type and bPAC sperm was largely abolished (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Elevation of basal cAMP levels by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX restored tyrosine phosphorylation in wild-type sperm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Similarly, in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, the light-stimulated increase of cAMP levels restored tyrosine phosphorylation in bPAC sperm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), demonstrating that bPAC activation compensates for the loss of SACY activity. Furthermore, we examined whether in sperm lacking functional SACY, bPAC activation can restore motility and the ability to fertilize the egg. To this end, we crossed Prm1-bPAC mice with mice lacking the sperm-specific Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger sNHE, encoded by the <i>Slc9a10</i> gene. Male <i>Slc9a10-</i>null mice are infertile, because their sperm are largely immotile (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2003</a>). In <i>Slc9a10-</i>null mice, the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-stimulated SACY activity is abolished as well, probably because sNHE and SACY form a functional signaling complex that is disrupted in these mice (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wang et al., 2007</a>). The motility of <i>Slc9a10-</i>null sperm is restored by db-cAMP (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2003</a>); however, db-cAMP not only elevates cAMP levels but also evokes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via CatSper (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Thus, we tested whether motility can be restored by solely increasing cAMP levels with light. Sperm were immotile in darkness (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, left); light stimulation restored both the flagellar beat and forward motility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, right; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), demonstrating that restoring cAMP levels alone is sufficient to rescue motility. We went one step further and tested whether <i>Slc9a10-</i>null/bPAC sperm also regain their fertilization potential upon light stimulation. Indeed, light-stimulated <i>Slc9a10-</i>null/bPAC sperm were able to fertilize oocytes in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), demonstrating that optogenetics can restore fertility."

In fact, bPAC mimics the effect of SACY activity: the light-stimulated increase in cAMP levels is similar to that activated by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> and activation of bPAC increases the flagellar beat frequency in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the Prm1-bPAC mouse model is an ideal optogenetic tool to study cAMP signaling in sperm."

Sperm from infertile <i>Slc9a10-</i>null mice are devoid of cAMP signaling, because they lack HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>-stimulated SACY activity, which is essential for sperm motility (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2007</a>). Expression of bPAC in <i>Slc9a10-</i>null sperm allowed restoring motility after light stimulation and, most importantly, restoring fertilization in vitro. Of note, in vitro fertilization (IVF) using light-stimulated sperm was successful using zona pellucida-intact oocytes, demonstrating that a cAMP increase, at least in vitro, is sufficient to restore fertility in <i>Slc9a10-</i>null mice. In contrast, incubation of <i>Slc9a10-</i>null sperm with cAMP analogs only restored fertilization of zona pellucida-free but not zona pellucida-intact oocytes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2003</a>). This discrepancy could be explained by (1) cAMP analogs not reaching sufficiently high levels in sperm, or (2) cAMP analogs being not as efficient as cAMP to stimulate downstream targets, or (3) non-specific effects compromising the interpretation of their action (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brenker et al., 2012</a>). The Prm1-bPAC mouse model holds great promise studying cAMP signaling uncompromised by side effects and allowed us to solve a long-standing controversy by showing that cAMP, in fact, does not stimulate a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into mouse sperm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These results demonstrate that optogenetics can disentangle cellular events such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP signaling in vivo."

For example, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> stimulation evokes a rapid cAMP increase and changes the flagellar beat frequency within seconds. However, PKA-dependent activation of tyrosine phosphorylation is barely detectable within the first hour of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> incubation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Visconti et al., 1995a</a>). Thus, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> exhibits short-term and long-term effects and probably controls cellular events in addition to cAMP synthesis via SACY. The Prm1-bPAC mouse model allows deciphering these signaling events, if bPAC expression does not interfere with other signaling pathways."

The flagellar beat is controlled by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of PKA targets in the axoneme (<a href=\"#bib31\">Salathe, 2007</a>); however, it is unknown whether cAMP signaling is restricted to microdomains or whether changes in cAMP propagate along the flagellum. Compartmentalization of cAMP signaling confers specificity to this ubiquitous cellular messenger, for example, in cell-cycle progression or modulation of gene expression. (<a href=\"#bib22\">Michel and Scott, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Willoughby and Cooper, 2007</a>). Our results show that local illumination of the flagellum of bPAC sperm is sufficient to increase its beat frequency. Optogenetics using bPAC provides the spatial and temporal precision to increase cAMP levels in subcellular regions and specialized signaling compartments such as cilia and flagella, which allows to study complex signaling networks - not only in mammalian sperm but also any other ciliated cell type."

The salt precipitate and cell debris were sedimented by centrifugation (15 min, 15,000 g, 4\u00b0C). The cAMP content in the supernatant was determined by a competitive immunoassay (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA), including an acetylation step for higher sensitivity.

                                "text": "Sperm motility was studied in shallow observation chambers (depth 150 \u00b5m). Cells were tethered to the glass surface by adjusting the BSA concentration in the buffer to 0.3 mg/ml. For analysis, cells that had their head attached to the glass surface and that had a free beating flagellum were chosen. Sperm motility was recorded under an inverted microscope (IX71; Olympus) equipped with a dark-field condenser, a 10x objective (UPlanFL, NA 0.3; Olympus), and additional 1.6\u00d7 lenses (16\u00d7 final magnification). The temperature of the microscope incubator (Life Imaging Services, Basel, Switzerland) was adjusted to 37\u00b0C. To obtain sharp images of moving sperm, stroboscopic illumination (2 ms light pulses) was achieved using a red LED (M660L3-C1; Thorlabs, Newton, USA) with a custom-made power supply. The camera and the LED light pulses were synchronized using a function generator (33220A; Agilent). Images were collected at 200 frames per second using a CMOS camera with a pixel size of 11 \u00b5m (Dimax; PCO, Kelheim, Germany). Stimulation of bPAC was achieved using a collimated UV LED (365 nm; \u223c12 mW) coupled to the epifluorescence port of the microscope (M365L2-C1; Thorlabs) and a TTL-controlled custom-made power supply. Irradiation time was set using a TTL pulse generator (UTG100; ELV). For local activation of the flagellum of bPAC sperm, we partially focused the UV-LED onto a 100-\u00b5m diaphragm (Linos Photonik) by detuning its corresponding collimator lens. The diaphragm aperture was then imaged onto the objective focal plane by a plano-convex lens (f = 100 mm; LA1509A, Thorlabs). This resulted in a Gaussian-shaped UV spot (R<sup>2</sup> of the fit 0.96) with a 12-\u00b5m width at the focal plane. The total UV-light power delivered was 2.3 mW. Quantification of the flagellar beat was performed using custom-made programs written in MATLAB (MathWorks. Natick, USA). The software can be made available upon request. The program identified the best threshold for binarization followed by a skeleton operation to identify the flagellum. The flagellar beat parameters were determined within a time window of 0.5 s before and after each frame. For frames at the boundaries (the beginning or the end of the video or flanking the UV flash), the time windows were asymmetric but contained the same number of frames. We monitored the angle between the straight line connecting the middle of the flagellum with the sperm head and the axis of symmetry of the cell. This angle varied in a sinusoid-like manner in time. The beat frequency was obtained by fitting a sinus to this wave. For alignment of the flagellar beat envelopes, we used custom-made programs written in LabVIEW. Using defined thresholds, the image was binarized. From a user-defined region-of-interest centred at the cell head, the program determined the location of the head on subsequent frames using a registering procedure. The neck of the cell was identified by applying a mask with the shape of an annulus centred into the sperm head. The annulus had an internal diameter of 16 \u00b5m to cover the sperm head and a 4 \u00b5m longer external diameter, enough to resolve the first pixels of the neck. All frames were then rotated and superimposed with a rotation angle equal to the azimuth of the neck region on a reference system centred at the sperm head. For better visualization, representative datasets were smoothed using Graph Pad Prism 5.02 (factor 20 for global illumination, factor 100 local illumination)."

Emission light was passed through a BrightLine 536/40 filter (Semrock) and recorded by photomultiplier modules (H10723-20; Hamamatsu Photonics).

While the finding in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>, that light stimulation does not lead to detectable change in \u0394 F/F, is consistent with the idea that cAMP doesn't cause Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, there can be other interpretations to the data. For example, the light-induced [cAMP] increase is relatively moderate (\u223c2 to 4 fold) and is comparable to that induced by HCO<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Earlier studies by Babcock and colleagues (e.g. Wennemuth, JBC, 2000) showed that large detectable HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increases were obvious only when combined with K8.6 stimulus (higher [K+] with alkali bath). It is possible that at the level achieved by light stimulation in the current study, cAMP requires other co-stimuli to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Another possibility, perhaps even more likely, is that the 2-4 fold [cAMP] increase, which is measured from whole, is largely from sperm head (because of its overwhelmingly larger volume) but little from sperm principal piece where the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channels are localized. The experiments in the paper do not show whether there is [cAMP] increase in sperm tail upon light stimulation. The geometry of the sperm midpiece and the filled mitochondria perhaps are significant barriers for cAMP diffusion from sperm head to tail."

Is this concentration comparable to what was used previously in other studies that examined the effects of cAMP analogs on calcium entry? What was the concentration of db-cAMP used in</i> <a href=\"#fig2\"><i>Figure 2E</i></a> <i>(cAMP-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation)?</i>"

A db-cAMP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via CatSper has not been reported before. In general, this drug is used at millimolar concentrations to interfere with cAMP signaling. The concentration of db-cAMP used in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> was 1 mM, similar to what has been used in other studies (Visconti et al., 1955, Development). We have included this information in the figure legend."
