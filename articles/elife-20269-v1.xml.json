                    "text": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss is associated with increased consumption of weight-promoting foods. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to mediate reward anticipation. However, the precise role of the PFC in mediating reward responses to highly palatable foods (HPF) after REM sleep deprivation is unclear. We selectively reduced REM sleep in mice over a 25\u201348 hr period and chemogenetically inhibited the medial PFC (mPFC) by using an altered glutamate-gated and ivermectin-gated chloride channel that facilitated neuronal inhibition through hyperpolarizing infected neurons. HPF consumption was measured while the mPFC was inactivated and REM sleep loss was induced. We found that REM sleep loss increased HPF consumption compared to control animals. However, mPFC inactivation reversed the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption without affecting fat consumption. Our findings provide, for the first time, a causal link between REM sleep, mPFC function and HPF consumption."

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to mediate reward anticipation. However, the precise role of the PFC in mediating reward responses to highly palatable foods (HPF) after REM sleep deprivation is unclear. We selectively reduced REM sleep in mice over a 25\u201348 hr period and chemogenetically inhibited the medial PFC (mPFC) by using an altered glutamate-gated and ivermectin-gated chloride channel that facilitated neuronal inhibition through hyperpolarizing infected neurons. HPF consumption was measured while the mPFC was inactivated and REM sleep loss was induced. We found that REM sleep loss increased HPF consumption compared to control animals. However, mPFC inactivation reversed the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption without affecting fat consumption. Our findings provide, for the first time, a causal link between REM sleep, mPFC function and HPF consumption."

A study of more than 30,000 participants found that those who slept less than 6 hr per night were more likely to gain weight over a 1-year period compared to people who slept 7 to 8 hr per night (<a href=\"#bib24\">Watanabe et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, when healthy adults obtain insufficient sleep (i.e., 5 hr per night) they are more likely to consume weight-promoting foods compared to persons who obtain sufficient sleep (i.e., 9 hr per night; <a href=\"#bib11\">Markwald et al., 2013</a>). Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss itself may be sufficient to increase consumption of weight promoting, highly palatable foods (HPF). <a href=\"#bib20\">Shechter et al. (2012)</a> found that REM sleep loss in humans, over a period of 5 d, was inversely associated with hunger ratings and fat consumption. Indeed, increased intake of weight promoting, highly palatable foods may, over time, lead to adverse health outcomes such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases."

Healthy adults who were subjected to one night of total sleep loss reported an increased desire to consume high-calorie foods compared to non-sleep deprived controls (<a href=\"#bib4\">Greer et al., 2013</a>). In addition, sleep deprivation decreased activation, assessed by fMRI scans, in areas of the brain thought to mediate reward anticipation and inhibitory control, namely the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Greer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Stuss, 2011</a>). However, the relationship between brain function and sleep loss are not consistent. For example, presentation of HPF to sleep deprived healthy adults was not associated with anterior cingulate activation (<a href=\"#bib21\">St. Onge et al., 2014</a>) while in other instances a positive association was found between appetite for HPF and anterior cingulate function (<a href=\"#bib1\">Benedict et al., 2012</a>)."

To achieve this aim, we used a well-validated chemogenetic method (<a href=\"#bib8\">Lerchner et al., 2007</a>) to produce a modified invertebrate chloride channel (GluCl\u03b1\u03b2) that when activated by the drug ivermectin (IVM) facilitates neuronal inhibition in the mPFC over several days. We then examined the effect of mPFC inactivation and REM sleep loss on appetite for HPF in mice."

Whereas, mPFC inhibition completely reversed increased sucrose intake by attenuating the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption.

Brain circuits responsible for judging the palatability of foods such as taste, texture and smell are mediated by areas of the PFC including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Rolls, 2015</a>). More specifically, the anterior cingulate appears to mediate taste for glucose in primates as feeding fruit juice (i.e., a high-glucose\u00a0food) to satiety decreased neuronal firing in the anterior cingulate cortex using single cell recordings, whereas initial juice feeding increased neuronal firing in these animals (<a href=\"#bib17\">Rolls, 2008</a>). Chocolate flavor also increases activation, as measured by fMRI, in the anterior cingulate cortex in humans (<a href=\"#bib16\">Rolls and McCabe, 2007</a>). In addition, obese patients display increased PFC activity in response to high-calorie visual food stimuli; specifically, increased activity in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Stoeckel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Rothemund et al., 2007</a>). Alterations in PFC brain activity may, over time, result in the inability of these persons to inhibit salient food cues leading to excess high calorie food consumption and weight gain. Our results support these data by directly manipulating mPFC function in mice, which resulted in a substantial decrease in sucrose consumption, but had no effect on fat consumption. On the other hand, it is unknown whether consumption of other highly palatable foods may be effected by mPFC inactivation and/or REM disruption (e.g., foods high in salt content). Future research is needed to explore this possibility. The mPFC contains heterogeneous neurons that include some inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (approximately 20%) and excitatory pyramidal neurons (approximately 80%; (<a href=\"#bib15\">Riga et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, mPFC neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptors mediate food consumption (<a href=\"#bib6\">Land et al., 2014</a>); however, it is currently unknown what role this neuronal subtype may play in controlling highly palatable food consumption in response to REM sleep disruption."

For example, REM sleep loss in humans enhances the desire to consume food and increases food consumption (<a href=\"#bib3\">Gonnissen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Shechter et al., 2012</a>). In addition, REM sleep loss in children and adolescents, of 1 hr per night measured over three nights, was associated with a marked increase in the likelihood of these children being overweight (<a href=\"#bib9\">Liu et al., 2008</a>). In agreement with these findings, we observed that reducing REM sleep, over a 25\u201348 hr period, during the dark phase resulted in increased HPF consumption. On the other hand, it should be noted that, in the current investigation, REM sleep was not effected during the light phase. It is unknown why our observed reduction in REM sleep was restricted to the dark phase and not during the light phase. Indeed, sleep pressure is greater during the light phase compared to the dark phase in mice; therefore, it is possible that our device was only able to produce REM reduction during the dark phase when sleep pressure was weaker. In addition, the REM sleep disruption observed in the current investigation did not occur during the first 24 hr after WMGD introduction. A plausible explanation is that the sleep reducing effect of our device requires time to build-up and thus produce disturbances in sleep."

The highly palatable foods were introduced on day 8 and food consumption was subsequently measured every 24 hr at 17:00 over a total period of 72 hr.

All three groups were not exposed to the wire-mesh-grid cage bottom (i.e., the non-sleep deprived groups). During the 72 hr test period, all mice had free access to white chocolate (DARS brand, Morinaga Company, Tokyo, Japan), a high-fat diet (HFD-60, Oriental Yeast Company, Tokyo, Japan) and standard laboratory chow (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> for the composition of each highly palatable diet).

They demonstrate that sleep loss induces an increase of a diet rich in sucrose. Notably, chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC neurons blunted that increase. They did not find an effect to blunt a high fat diet. Collectively, the results are novel and are potentially of wide interest. It is widely accepted that sleep disruption affects metabolism and energy balance. However, the CNS sites and mechanisms linking sleep disruption and obesity are poorly defined. However, as it currently stands the manuscript has several issues that need to be addressed."
