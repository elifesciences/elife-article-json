A few genes are transcribed before this stage but how this differential activation is accomplished is still an open question. We have performed ChIP-seq experiments on tightly staged <i>Drosophila</i> embryos and show that massive recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with widespread pausing occurs de novo during the midblastula transition. However, \u223c100 genes are strongly occupied by Pol II before this timepoint and most of them do not show Pol II pausing, consistent with a requirement for rapid transcription during the fast nuclear cycles. This global change in Pol II pausing correlates with distinct core promoter elements and associates a TATA-enriched promoter with the rapid early transcription. This suggests that promoters are differentially used during the zygotic genome activation, presumably because they have distinct dynamic properties."

A few genes are transcribed before this stage but how this differential activation is accomplished is still an open question. We have performed ChIP-seq experiments on tightly staged <i>Drosophila</i> embryos and show that massive recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with widespread pausing occurs de novo during the midblastula transition. However, \u223c100 genes are strongly occupied by Pol II before this timepoint and most of them do not show Pol II pausing, consistent with a requirement for rapid transcription during the fast nuclear cycles. This global change in Pol II pausing correlates with distinct core promoter elements and associates a TATA-enriched promoter with the rapid early transcription. This suggests that promoters are differentially used during the zygotic genome activation, presumably because they have distinct dynamic properties."

Instead, the mother deposits RNA molecules in the egg as it forms inside her, and after the egg has been fertilized, these RNA molecules are translated into proteins that guide the development of the early embryo. Only at a stage called midblastula transition does the zygote take over control by transcribing its own RNA molecules."

In particular, it is not known if the molecular machinery needed to transcribe the genes is recruited a long time before transcription starts, or if it is recruited \u2018just in time\u2019. Here, Chen et al. explore how genes are switched on in the fruit fly zygote."

Chen et al. used a technique called ChIP-Seq to determine how much RNA polymerase was bound to the DNA before, during and after the midblastula transition. Before the transition\u2014from about eight rounds of DNA replication onward\u2014RNA polymerase was bound to only about 100 genes, and was active in most of these cases. In contrast, after the transition, RNA polymerase had been recruited to the promoters of around 4000 genes (fruit flies have a total of about 14,000 genes). However, it was often found in a paused, rather than active, form, at these genes, which is thought to help ensure that their transcription can occur on a precise schedule."

Strikingly, there were clear differences in the sequence motifs that recruited RNA polymerase to the promoters of genes that were transcribed immediately and those that showed pausing of the polymerase. Moreover, genes that were transcribed before the midblastula transition were shorter, on average, than those transcribed after. This suggests that transcription during the rapid genome replication cycles has to occur quickly and therefore lacks pausing. Together, these findings present a biological rationale for differences in how genes are first transcribed during fruit fly development."

In animals such as <i>Xenopus</i>, zebrafish and <i>Drosophila</i>, development begins with rapid, synchronous cell divisions without gap phases (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lamb and Laird, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</a>). During the midblastula transition (MBT), cells switch to prolonged asynchronous divisions and this coincides with a massive increase in zygotic transcription. Before the MBT, only a small set of \u2018pre-MBT genes\u2019 are expressed. How this differential transcription is set up globally during these early stages of development, including the role of histone modifications and the recruitment of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), has been the subject of considerable interest (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akkers et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lindeman et al., 2011</a>). In mammalian embryonic stem cells, as well as early <i>Drosophila</i> embryos, paused Pol II is frequently found at developmental control genes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Guenther et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Min et al., 2011</a>), but it is not known when pausing is first established in the embryo. Pol II pausing prior to activation may promote the rapid and synchronous induction of genes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boettiger and Levine, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman and Lis, 2012</a>), but it is unclear whether Pol II can be recruited and paused during the rapid early nuclear cycles prior to the MBT (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim and Jinks-Robertson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Petruk et al., 2012</a>)."

However, we did not find these marks in <i>Drosophila</i> nuclei prior to gene activation. In both immunostainings and ChIP-seq data, the signal of H3K4me3, a modification associated with gene activation, only starts to be detectable during the MBT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, see also the ChIP-seq results in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). H3K27me3, a marker of Polycomb-mediated gene silencing and possibly epigenetic memory, can be detected in nuclei and in polar bodies at the earliest cleavage stages but is then undetectable in somatic nuclei until after the MBT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Consistent with this, the ChIP-seq H3k27me3 signal at Polycomb response elements (PREs) increases over time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, H3K27me3 is likely present in oocytes but may be diluted or erased during replication consistent with a recent study (<a href=\"#bib42\">Petruk et al., 2012</a>).

Note that genes can have core promoter elements of both modes (e.g., TATA and PB), leading them to switch from a non-pausing behavior to a pausing behavior during the midblastula transition.

For example, we have analyzed promoters during muscle development and find that many genes are induced during late stages of embryogenesis without prior Pol II pausing and that these genes are also enriched in TATA (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gaertner et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with this, statistical analyses suggest that the combination of Inr and TATA represents a separate class of promoters that is often found among genes expressed in adult tissues (<a href=\"#bib15\">FitzGerald et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lenhard et al., 2012</a>).

Pre-MBT embryos were carefully hand-sorted and analyzed by ChIP-seq for Pol II, TBP, and histone modifications (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Strong occupancy of TBP and Pol II as well as low levels of H3K4me3 were observed on the pre-MBT genes in the pre-MBT embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). By using a pausing index based on the distribution of Pol II, it was found that most (77 to 107 out of 117) pre-MBT genes exhibit little transcriptional pausing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In contrast, a strong extent of pausing was observed with genes that are activated during the MBT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were essentially absent from the nuclei of pre-MBT embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Analysis of core promoter sequences revealed that the TATA box is significantly enriched in the promoters of pre-MBT genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). These findings lead to the model shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. In essence, zygotic transcription from pre-MBT genes appears to occur typically via the TATA box by a mechanism that does not involve transcriptional pausing."
