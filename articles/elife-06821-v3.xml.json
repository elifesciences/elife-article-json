Here, we uncover a novel mechanism licensing transcription in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) adipogenically primed by confluence. Prior to adipogenesis, confluency promotes heterodimer recruitment of the bZip TFs C/EBP\u03b2 and ATF4 to a non-canonical C/EBP DNA sequence. ATF4 depletion decreases both cell-density-dependent transcription and adipocyte differentiation. Global profiling in hMSCs and a novel cell-free assay reveals that ATF4 requires C/EBP\u03b2 for genomic binding at a motif distinct from that bound by the C/EBP\u03b2 homodimer. Our observations demonstrate that C/EBP\u03b2 bridges the transcriptional programs in na\u00efve, confluent cells and early differentiating pre-adipocytes. Moreover, they suggest that homo- and heterodimer formation poise C/EBP\u03b2 to execute diverse and stage-specific transcriptional programs by exploiting an expanded motif repertoire."

Here, we uncover a novel mechanism licensing transcription in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) adipogenically primed by confluence. Prior to adipogenesis, confluency promotes heterodimer recruitment of the bZip TFs C/EBP\u03b2 and ATF4 to a non-canonical C/EBP DNA sequence. ATF4 depletion decreases both cell-density-dependent transcription and adipocyte differentiation. Global profiling in hMSCs and a novel cell-free assay reveals that ATF4 requires C/EBP\u03b2 for genomic binding at a motif distinct from that bound by the C/EBP\u03b2 homodimer. Our observations demonstrate that C/EBP\u03b2 bridges the transcriptional programs in na\u00efve, confluent cells and early differentiating pre-adipocytes. Moreover, they suggest that homo- and heterodimer formation poise C/EBP\u03b2 to execute diverse and stage-specific transcriptional programs by exploiting an expanded motif repertoire."

When mesenchymal stem cells become tightly packed, more of another protein called ATF4 is produced. This protein binds to C/EBP\u03b2, and the resulting two-protein complex then binds to sites on the DNA of the mesenchymal stem cell to activate genes that turn the stem cell into a pre-adipocyte. Reducing the amount of ATF4 in mesenchymal stem cells reduces the number of pre-adipocytes that develop."

The cell-fate decisions occurring during the stages of adipogenesis are controlled by multiple sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Farmer, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cristancho and Lazar, 2011</a>). Best described among these are PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP TFs, which drive a process of terminal differentiation that results in the expression of metabolic genes and adipokines important for the adipocyte phenotype (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hwang et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lefterova and Lazar, 2009</a>). PPAR\u03b3 is recognized as a master regulator because it is necessary (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barak et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kubota et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rosen et al., 1999</a>) and sufficient (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tontonoz et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hu et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shao and Lazar, 1997</a>) for adipogenesis. C/EBP proteins can also induce adipocyte differentiation of fibroblasts, although none can induce differentiation in the absence of PPAR\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rosen et al., 2002</a>). Cistromic analyses have revealed that PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 occupy sites near most of the genes that are up-regulated during adipogenesis, including their own, suggesting that they coordinate expression of the majority of genes determining adipocyte function (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lefterova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nielsen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schmidt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Soccio et al., 2011</a>).

While lacking a canonical, palindromic C/EBP\u03b2 motif, these enhancers exhibit dramatic enrichment for an asymmetric, composite motif that juxtaposes half-sites for canonical C/EBP and AP-1 motifs. We demonstrate that these hybrid motifs recruit C/EBP\u03b2 as a heterodimer with another bZIP family member, ATF4. Genome-wide binding by ATF4 demonstrates its exclusive co-localization with C/EBP\u03b2, and depletion of ATF4 decreases adipogenesis. Together, these observations suggest that a program of C/EBP\u03b2-ATF4-dependent gene expression triggered by high-seeding density plays an important role in priming hMSCs for adipogenesis. The observation that C/EBP\u03b2 hetero- and homodimeric complexes exhibit different sequence specificities provides novel mechanistic insights into how C/EBP\u03b2 can be differentially targeted to control distinct programs of gene expression at distinct phases of adipocyte differentiation, and revises the prevailing view that C/EBP\u03b2 is transcriptionally inactive in the absence of exogenous adipogenic stimuli (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wiper-Bergeron et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Raghav et al., 2012</a>)."

To address this idea, we placed several RNAPII-annotated regions that are targeted by C/EBP\u03b2 and harbor either a hybrid or canonical motif into luciferase reporters, and assayed their activity in response to DMI cocktail (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Interestingly, reporters carrying the hybrid motif had reduced in activity in the presence of DMI, while those with the canonical C/EBP sequence were increased by DMI. Moreover, the hybrid motif mediates transcriptional activity since targeted mutation of either the hybrid sequence specifically (Hyb-) or the C/EBP motif generally (C/EBP-) lowered luciferase activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To further test the functional significance of C/EBP motifs in regulating gene transcription, we quantified mRNAs for genes with nearby RNAPII-annotated regions bound by C/EBP\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Consistent with the changes in both RNAPII occupancy and the luciferase reporters, genes associated with the hybrid motif showed decreased expression upon DMI stimulation. In contrast, genes associated with the canonical C/EBP motif (<i>AKR1C1</i>, <i>ALOX15b</i>, <i>FKBP5</i>, <i>HSD11b1</i>, and <i>ZBTB16</i>) were activated by DMI treatment along with a control adipocyte marker (<i>PDK4</i>). As a whole, these findings suggest that C/EBP\u03b2 targets a non-canonical C/EBP motif to activate HD-primed enhancers. Furthermore, although the addition of DMI cocktail increases C/EBP\u03b2 occupancy globally, including sites associated with the HD-primed enhancers, it reduces the activity of the HD-primed enhancers while inducing enhancers harboring canonical C/EBP motifs."

ATF4 occupies sites near all of the genes observed in the HD-primed clusters that function in amino acid transport and metabolism and tRNA aminoacylation (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Relative to C/EBP\u03b2, ATF4 occupies sites that are highly enriched for RNAPII, with the majority of these falling in the HD-primed clusters (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Thus, ATF4 is intimately tied to HD-primed RNAPII, implicating it in the activation of gene transcription in response to high-cell-density seeding of hMSCs. These data also imply that ATF4 abundance may be regulated by cell density. Indeed, western analysis revealed that while ATF4 levels in uncommitted LD cells were negligible, ATF4 was up-regulated in response to high-cell-seeding density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Furthermore, upon addition of DMI cocktail, ATF4 expression diminished modestly at 3 hr and prominently by 24 hr. As expected, C/EBP\u03b2 showed a rapid and sustained induction by DMI in hMSCs. To determine if ATF4 genomic occupancy was correlated with its abundance, we performed ChIP in cells cultured at LD or HD with or without DMI treatment. ATF4 occupancy at hybrid sites was strongly reduced in either untreated LD hMSCs or DMI-treated HD hMSCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). C/EBP\u03b2, in contrast, bound to the hybrid sites irrespective of the cell seeding conditions. Concomitant with C/EBP\u03b2 up-regulation by differentiation cocktail, a trend of increased binding was apparent in the DMI condition. These observations indicate that ATF4 protein level is modulated by signals derived from both cell density and DMI cocktail, leading to functional interaction with C/EBP\u03b2 in primed hMSCs as well as early in adipogenesis."

Transient transfection with ATF4 siRNAs decreased the level of Oil Red O staining relative to controls, indicating lower lipid accumulation in the ATF4 knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In parallel, early markers of adipogenesis were decreased threefold\u2013fourfold in ATF4 knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), including the mRNAs encoding the lineage-determining TFs PPAR\u03b32 and C/EBP\u03b1, as well as several of their downstream transcriptional targets. This deficit in adipogenic gene expression became more pronounced over time (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and together, these data suggest that ATF4 expression is important for adipogenesis. To better define the role of ATF4, we measured genomic binding in ATF4 knockdown cells. As expected, ATF4 occupancy was significantly reduced at all sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Notably, RNAPII occupancy was diminished at all but one of the ATF4-binding sites, and most of these showed a significant reduction, indicating that ATF4 functions to recruit RNAPII. C/EBP\u03b2 binding was decreased at all sites, but reached significance at a minority, which is not surprising given that C/EBP\u03b2 can occupy these sites under conditions with little or no ATF4 binding. These data establish ATF4 as a novel density-dependent TF that transduces signals from multiple pro-adipogenic stimuli including cell density and DMI cocktail to program the activity of HD-primed enhancers and promote adipocyte differentiation."

This stage-specific gene expression program is driven by robust sequence-specificity of the C/EBP\u03b2-ATF4 heterodimer, such that it preferentially occupies hybrid sequences relative to the C/EBP\u03b2 homodimer, with ATF4's genomic function tied exclusively to C/EBP\u03b2. Whether these findings are emergent properties of the intrinsic DNA-binding specificities of ATF4, C/EBP\u03b2 and the C/EBP\u03b2-ATF4 heterodimer or result from other mechanisms is unknown. To gain insight into this, we performed EMSA with DNA probes representing the different motifs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), and recombinant ATF4 and C/EBP\u03b2 purified from <i>Escherichia coli</i> to ensure homogenous preparations that lacked other potential bZip binding partners typically present in mammalian cell extracts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). ATF4 exhibited no detectable binding to either sequence by itself, while C/EBP\u03b2 bound both, but preferred the palindromic C/EBP motif (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Addition of recombinant ATF4 to C/EBP\u03b2 increased binding to the ATF4 motif at the lower protein concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, lanes 4\u20139), indicating that ATF4 and C/EBP\u03b2 readily form heterodimers in solution as shown previously for other bZip proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 1991</a>), and revealing that the heterodimer recognizes this sequence with higher affinity than the C/EBP\u03b2 homodimer. In contrast, ATF4 decreased C/EBP\u03b2 occupancy of the palindromic C/EBP motif (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, lanes 1\u20136), suggesting that the C/EBP\u03b2-ATF4 heterodimer has lower affinity relative to the C/EBP\u03b2 homodimer for this sequence. Similar results were obtained with a reverse titration scheme (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and antibody controls demonstrated that ATF4 and/or C/EBP\u03b2 produce the protein-DNA complexes, further supporting these conclusions."

Akin to EMSA, recombinant TFs and isolated DNA were interrogated via solution phase binding.

In support of this, de novo motif analyses revealed stronger enrichment of the C/EBP motif at the top-ranked sites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Yet, the C/EBP motif was the top-ranked sequence for both the strongest and weakest sites, indicating appropriate specificity for the C/EBP\u03b2 homodimer even at the higher protein levels. We anticipated that the number of C/EBP\u03b2-binding sites observed in vitro would exceed that found in cells due to the removal of accessibility barriers imposed by chromatin. To test this, we examined the level of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), a marker of active transcription and open chromatin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Stasevich et al., 2014</a>), in hMSCs at regions bound by C/EBP\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Unlike sites occupied in hMSCs, the in-vitro-specific sites have little or no H3K27ac in cells, suggesting that they reside in inactive chromatin.

Upon addition of ATF4, C/EBP\u03b2 exhibited reduced occupancy of C/EBP\u03b2-homodimer sites and de novo binding at sites not represented in the homodimer cistromes generated with higher C/EBP\u03b2 concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, tracks 1\u20134). Induced C/EBP\u03b2-binding sites displayed parallel enrichment for ATF4 occupancy (tracks 5 and 6). Motif analysis showed robust enrichment of the hybrid motif at these sites, reproducing the exquisite specificity mapped in the hMSC ATF4 cistrome. Remarkably, ATF4 by itself exhibited no detectable binding to these regions (track 7), demonstrating that its interaction with the genome is exclusively heterodimeric. In total, we identified 111 peaks in the ATF4 homodimer cistrome, and these were enriched for multimers of a c-JUN motif (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). These rare sites are not occupied by ATF4 in hMSCs, revealing that homodimeric binding by ATF4 may not be physiological. Together, the EMSA and in vitro cistromics experiments demonstrate that the DNA-binding properties of ATF4 and C/EBP\u03b2 are sufficient to reconstitute their sequence specificities observed in cells."

High cell density has long been known to be an important condition for adipocyte differentiation in vitro (<a href=\"#bib12\">Green and Kehinde, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pittenger et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">McBeath et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cristancho et al., 2011</a>). It is likely that a combination of cues is required in tissue microenvironments supporting adipogenesis in vivo. ATF4 joins a small, yet growing list of TFs that confer adipogenic competency. A major block in identifying TFs controlling the formation of pre-adipocyte cells is the lack of molecular markers distinguishing na\u00efve hMSCs from committed pre-adipocytes. Nevertheless, several candidate TFs have been identified in murine cell culture models. ZFP423 is expressed almost exclusively in adipogenic fibroblasts, and is necessary for adipocyte differentiation in vitro and for the development of adipose tissue in mice (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gupta et al., 2010</a>). TCF7L1 promotes commitment of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to a pre-adipocyte state in response to cell confluency (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cristancho et al., 2011</a>). KAISO, in contrast, represses pre-adipocyte differentiation by recruiting the co-repressor SMRT to promoters (<a href=\"#bib43\">Raghav et al., 2012</a>). Each of these studies marks an important advance in understanding pre-adipocyte biology, yet it remains unclear as to how, or if, these pre-adipocyte TFs functionally interact with each other or with the TFs responding to adipogenic signals. Here, the identification of the C/EBP\u03b2-ATF4 heterodimer points to a mechanism that connects adipogenic competency and early differentiation through the sharing of C/EBP\u03b2."

Our demonstration of a role for ATF4 in adult stem cell adipocyte differentiation suggest that this regulatory mechanism could be especially relevant in adult adipose tissue, consistent with the recent demonstration that adipogenesis occurs via distinct cell lineages during development vs adulthood (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>). Depletion of ATF4 in 3T3-L1 cells blocks adipocyte differentiation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yu et al., 2014</a>).

First, genomic binding of ATF4 requires heterodimerization with C/EBP\u03b2. While elegant biochemical studies have demonstrated the propensity of ATF4 and C/EBP\u03b2 to heterodimerize (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vinson et al., 1993</a>), early studies also reported DNA-binding activity for ATF4 homodimers at palindromic cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vinson et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Podust et al., 2001</a>). In this light, our finding of a paucity of ATF4 homodimeric sites is unexpected, and indicates that while such interactions may be detectable when the relative concentration of the motif is high, the affinity of ATF4 homodimers for the CRE sequence is insufficient to produce binding in cells, or in vitro when a large amount of competitor DNA is present. In support of these coclusions, PBM-based assays failed to identify a robust motif for ATF4 homodimers (<a href=\"#bib65\">Weirauch et al., 2014</a>), whereas HT-SELEX assays showed robust sequence preference of ATF4 for hybrid motifs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jolma et al., 2013</a>)."

The relative plasticity of C/EBP\u03b2 homodimer in accommodating multiple DNA sequence variants is borne out in vivo, as the top motif associated with the cellular C/EBP\u03b2 cistrome shows considerable degeneracy at the \u22121 and \u22122 positions. In contrast, the C/EBP\u03b2-ATF4 heterodimer is restricted to hybrid motifs of two inverted half-sites, TTRSATCA. Thus the biochemical properties of the heterodimer are sufficient to explain the nearly 1:1 correspondence between ATF4 binding and the presence of hybrid motifs in vivo. Interestingly, ATF4 heterodimerizes with the C/EBP related protein, CHOP, in the context of ER stress to bind hybrid motifs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Han et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that while heterodimerization is required for DNA binding, the specific C/EBP partner can vary in different biological contexts."

DMI-treated hMSCs show persistent occupancy of the hybrid sites by C/EBP\u03b2 despite low ATF4 levels. An interesting possibility is that persistent binding is attributable to the elevated C/EBP\u03b2 concentrations in differentiating cells, however the effects of DMI-induced post-translational modification of C/EBP\u03b2 on homodimer binding cannot be excluded. Notably, robust RNAPII recruitment at hybrid sites was observed in cells only in the presence of ATF4. Thus, hetero vs homodimeric binding may have important consequences for licensing transcription activity, especially under conditions where the basal activity of C/EBP\u03b2 is limiting, possibly due to associated repressor complexes (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wiper-Bergeron et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Raghav et al., 2012</a>)."

By analogy with the C/EBP\u03b2-ATF4 heterodimer, other C/EBP\u03b2-bZip heterodimers may selectively recognize non-degenerate DNA sequences, which could illuminate fundamental rules governing their operation on a genome scale, and help to explain discrepancies between the palindromic C/EBP motif identified in vitro (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jolma et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Weirauch et al., 2014</a>) and the ChIP-seq motif with substantial variation at the central positions. Consistent with this paradigm, heterodimers displaying greatest affinity for TGACGCAA, which differs from the C/EBP\u03b2-ATF4 motif by single T/C substitution at the fourth position, were observed through forced expression of C/EBP\u03b1 with either c-JUN or c-FOS (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hong et al., 2011</a>) and inferred from DNase I footprinting in 3T3-L1 cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">Siersb\u00e6k et al., 2014a</a>). We propose that the degenerate C/EBP motif observed in cells results from the binding of different homo- and heterodimeric protein complexes with distinct sequence specificities. Because C/EBP proteins are widely expressed with additional bZip family members, determining how they target the genome is critical to understanding their control of basic processes including cell growth and development."

The first IP for sequential ChIP was performed with whole cell extract derived from approximately 5 million formaldehyde-crosslinked hMSCs. After overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with antibody and protein G sepharose in 1 ml ChIP buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate and Complete protease inhibitor), IPs were washed and then eluted by incubation at 65\u00b0C for 15 min in 50 \u03bcl ChIP elution buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) with 10 mM DTT. Beads were pelleted and the supernatant transferred to a new tube. A subsequent wash with 50 \u03bcl ChIP elution buffer was performed with the beads, and the supernatants combined. Eluted protein-DNA complexes were added to 1 ml ChIP buffer with 5 mg/ml BSA and 2 \u03bcg nonspecific DNA. Samples were split into two equal parts and volumes raised to 1 ml with ChIP buffer. One aliquot received antibody against a particular TF, the other rabbit IgG, and samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1\u20132 hr. Immune complexes were captured by protein G sepharose, washed, eluted, and incubated overnight at 65\u00b0C to reverse formaldehyde crosslinks. DNA was subsequently isolated for PCR.

Peak calling on TF ChIP-Seq tracks and all de novo motif analyses were performed using HOMER (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heinz et al., 2010</a>). Peak calling for RNAPII and sequence tag analyses for features of interest were performed on the Galaxy and Cistrome servers. CEAS analysis (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2009</a>) and generation of Venn Diagrams were performed on Cistrome. Mapping RNAPII to nearby genes was done using GREAT (<a href=\"#bib34\">McLean et al., 2010</a>). GO analysis was conducted with DAVID Resources (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dennis et al., 2003</a>).

To eliminate artifacts introduced by regions of low ChIP signals caused by poor mappability, regions of no RNAPII sequence coverage were masked based on their mappability scores from the ENCODE Duke Uniqueness 35 bp track. Masked regions (low mappability, low ChIP signal) that were juxtaposed to bins with enriched RNAPII signal were assigned an interpolated USHP score, that is, the average USHP score of adjacent upstream and downstream bins unaffected by mappability. RNAPII data were smoothened by recalculating USHP scores as the moving average of a 60 bp window centered on each 20 bp bin. Genomic regions with high sequencing depth in the input (no ChIP) tracks were subtracted from the RNAPII data to remove false positive peaks. Finally, each bin was assigned a \u2018USHP slope\u2019 score computed from the difference of the USHP values for the bin lying 60 bp downstream vs the bin 60 bp upstream divided by the intervening bp length (100 bp internally)."

Briefly, RNAPII bins were thresholded for USHP slope scores and clustered to detect regions of positive or negative USHP slopes. Each positive sloping region was joined with the nearest downstream negative slope region, with a maximum cutoff distance of 400 bp between the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the positively and negatively sloping regions. Adjacent RNAPII features were then evaluated for peak merging based on the peak to trough ratios (rations &lt; 2.5 were merged), such that complex RNAPII features comprised of poorly resolved multiplets were treated as a single feature. To evaluate enrichment of sequence reads within the putative RNAPII features, features within 2 kb were clustered, and these domains expanded to \u00b11 kb to sample the local RNAPII background. Peak-associated bins within these domains were masked and the average USHP signal per bin in the local neighborhood computed. RNAPII features with USHP maxima that were 3.5-fold greater than the mean of non-peak associated local USHP bins were used in subsequent analyses. In addition, RNAPII features intervals were subject to a signal threshold requiring a tag count of \u226520 per feature or a tag density of at least 14.5 sequence tags per bp. All steps of the RNAPII feature detection algorithm were scripted through the Galaxy server, and will be available as published workflows."

Following attributed-based group assignment, the complexity of the clustering results was simplified by grouping together functionally related clusters. Similar classes of RNAPII were detected with non-supervised clustering methods (k-means clustering using Cluster 3.0). For heat map representations of the RNAPII data, the data was transformed to represent the log<sub>2</sub> fold change of the condition-specific tag count relative to the mean tag count observed for all four RNAPII tracks (e.g., log<sub>2</sub> [tags in condition #1/mean tag count at the RNAPII peak for all conditions]).

To directly address adipogenesis, we measured the expression of key differentiation markers in hMSCs with normal and reduced levels of ATF4. Transcriptional activation of <i>PPAR\u03b3</i> and <i>C/EBP\u03b1</i>, both encoding adipose-determining transcription factors, is significantly decreased in hMSCs depleted for ATF4 in response to adipogenic signals. Several downstream gene targets important for adipocyte differentiation also have reduced expression, suggesting that ATF4 affects lipid accumulation by promoting adipogenesis. These data have been added to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, and referred to in the subsection headed \u201cLoss of ATF4 Attenuates Adipogenesis and Cell-Density-Dependent Transcription\u201d as follows: In parallel, early markers of adipogenesis were decreased 3-4-fold in ATF4 knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), including the mRNAs encoding the lineage-determining TFs PPAR\u03b32 and C/EBP\u03b1, as well as several of their downstream transcriptional targets. This deficit in adipogenic gene expression became more pronounced over time (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), and together, these data suggest that ATF4 expression is important for adipogenesis."

However, rather than restoring function, forced expression of C/EBP\u03b2 under ATF4 knockdown conditions will yield abnormally high C/EBP\u03b2 levels, limiting the interpretation of any potential effects on adipogenesis. Forced C/EBP\u03b2 expression has been shown by the Spiegelman and Farmer labs to trigger adipogenesis in NIH-3T3 cells, likely by overwhelming and/or overriding the system and obviating the need for pre-adipocyte-specific transcription. Thus, we do not believe that this experiment can resolve how ATF4 contributes to adipogenic commitment."

GO results derived from mapping ATF4-binding sites to nearby genes are now included in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>. They are similar to the GO results obtained from the HD-primed RNAPII sites. To provide a clearer display of the relationship between ATF4 and RNAPII genomic occupancy, we determined the fraction of ATF4 or C/EBP\u03b2 sites that co-localize with RNAPII, and present the results as pie charts in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>.
