We experimentally characterized all combinations of genotypes in the joint protein-DNA sequence space defined by an historical transition in TF-RE specificity that occurred some 500 million years ago in the DNA-binding domain of an ancient steroid hormone receptor. We found that rampant epistasis within and between the two molecules was essential to specific TF-RE recognition and to the evolution of a novel TF-RE complex with unique derived specificity. Permissive and restrictive epistatic mutations across the TF-RE interface opened and closed potential evolutionary paths accessible by the other, making the evolution of each molecule contingent on its partner's history and allowing a molecular complex with novel specificity to evolve."

We experimentally characterized all combinations of genotypes in the joint protein-DNA sequence space defined by an historical transition in TF-RE specificity that occurred some 500 million years ago in the DNA-binding domain of an ancient steroid hormone receptor. We found that rampant epistasis within and between the two molecules was essential to specific TF-RE recognition and to the evolution of a novel TF-RE complex with unique derived specificity. Permissive and restrictive epistatic mutations across the TF-RE interface opened and closed potential evolutionary paths accessible by the other, making the evolution of each molecule contingent on its partner's history and allowing a molecular complex with novel specificity to evolve."

We previously reconstructed the ancestor of all SRs (AncSR1) and the ancestor of all PAMGRs (AncSR2) and assayed their affinities for ERE and SREs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We found that AncSR1 was ER-like, preferentially binding to ERE, and that AncSR2 was like PAMGRs, preferentially binding SREs. When just three of the 38 amino acid replacements that occurred during the evolutionary interval between AncSR1 and AncSR2 were introduced into AncSR1, they fully recapitulated the shift in half-site preference from ERE to SREs. These three replacements (glu25GLY, gly26SER, and ala29VAL, where lower and upper cases denote ancestral and derived states, respectively) were the only changes on the DBD's ten-residue recognition helix (RH), which inserts into the DNA major groove (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The ancestral and derived states at these three sites are completely conserved in modern-day ERs and PAMGRs, respectively, so the inference of their states in AncSR1 and AncSR2 was unambiguous. Although other substitutions during this interval affected the DBD's non-specific affinity for DNA and the cooperativity of dimeric binding, only the RH substitutions affected half-site specificity, and they did so without affecting cooperativity (<a href=\"#bib57\">McKeown et al., 2014</a>)."

Here we report on experiments to functionally map this region of the molecules' joint sequence space and to understand the implications of its topology for evolutionary processes. We experimentally measured the binding affinity of AncSR1-DBD variants containing all genotypic combinations of ancestral and derived amino acids in the RH in complexes with REs containing all possible combinations of nucleotides at the two variable positions in the half-site. We used these data to statistically estimate the main effects of every variable state in the DBD and the RE and of interactions between states within and between each molecule. This analysis allowed us to investigate how the causal determinants of binding changed as the regulatory complex evolved during the historical shift in function and to evaluate the plausibility that any pathway through the joint TF-RE space might have been followed under various evolutionary scenarios."

These determinants include the average (or \u2018main\u2019) effects of each possible nucleotide at the variable RE sites, as well as epistatic interactions, which occur when a combination of nucleotides at multiple sites affects affinity differently from expectation based on each nucleotide's average contribution. We used a multiple linear regression model (<a href=\"#bib85\">Stormo, 2011</a>) that predicts a protein's free energy of binding to an RE as the sum of all main and epistatic effects at the two variable positions 3 and 4 (for details, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019); a linear model is appropriate because the dependent variable is the \u0394G of reversible binding, which grows additively with the free energy of the factors that contribute to it (<a href=\"#bib9\">Benson, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dill, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Stout et al., 1998</a>).

This approach allows us to quantify the contribution to the total binding energy made by each individual state (the main effects) and every combination of states (epistatic effects). It also allows us to estimate the portion of all variation in affinity explained by each main and epistatic effect (expressed as the increase in adjusted R<sup>2</sup> when a parameter for any class of effect is added to the model) and to evaluate the statistical significance of the improvement in fit attributable to each class of parameters."

A strong epistatic effect (G3xT4) is also present, which further enhances affinity for the GT combination by 0.8 kcal/mole beyond that expected from the main effects of these two nucleotides.

AncSR1's specificity is further affected by a strong negative epistatic determinant G3xA4, which substantially reduces its affinity for SRE2 (GA); without this interaction, the protein's preference for G3 would have made SRE2 (GA) a high affinity target (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

To change specificity, an amino acid replacement must affect affinity for RE genotypes differently. Therefore, when amino acid replacements change specificity or preference for REs, epistasis across the protein-DNA interface must be involved. To statistically characterize this form of epistasis, we further expanded the linear models described above to simultaneously analyze the effects of the combined protein + DNA genotype on affinity. This approach allowed us to identify epistatic effects on affinity caused by combinations of amino acid replacements and nucleotide states. The magnitude of an epistatic effect across the molecular interface is the difference in the binding energy of complexes containing both a specific TF amino acid and a specific RE nucleotide from that predicted based on the average effects of each of those states. A replacement may also participate in third-order interactions with a combination of nucleotide states in the RE, if it specifically changes relative affinity for the combination more than expected from the first- and second-order effects together."

Because none of the replacements acted as a switch that impaired binding to some sequences while improving affinity for others, multiple replacements were necessary to achieve the derived specificity and affinity. Why would the shift in function not have occurred via a simpler genetic mechanism involving sign epistasis? We speculate that there are few or no potential replacements that have pinpoint opposite effects on different REs. The interface between a TF and DNA is heterogeneous and densely packed, and all four possible nucleotides share many similarities in the physical properties they confer on the DNA surface to which a TF binds. Thus, amino acid changes are more likely to alter binding in a generic direction across all possible versions of the RE, but they do so more effectively when paired with some nucleotides than with others."

We based our analysis on the concept of a connected network of functional protein genotypes, which assumes that purifying selection makes mutational pathways through nonfunctional intermediates very unlikely (<a href=\"#bib56\">Maynard Smith, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Wagner, 2008</a>). Although the RH substitutions occurred after a gene duplication of AncSR1, it is unlikely that either copy was released from purifying selection, because the ancestral function was conserved in both copies for tens or hundreds of millions of years before neofunctionalization occurred (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bridgham et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eick et al., 2012</a>). We defined each protein's set of functional RE targets as those that fulfill two simple criteria. First, to achieve reasonable occupancy by the low concentrations of TF typical in cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fisher et al., 2012</a>), the RE must be bound with moderate to high affinity, which we defined as greater than the average affinity across all TF-RE complexes tested. Further, a potential DNA binding site must compete with other REs for occupancy by the same TF, so the second criterion we imposed is that the affinity constant for an RE must be within a factor of ten of that protein's best target (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fisher et al., 2012</a>). TF:RE complexes not meeting these criteria were classified as low-occupancy and therefore nonfunctional. Although these criteria are somewhat arbitrary, they provide a starting point for understanding how the biochemical epistasis we observed, along with a simple nonlinearity in the transformation of affinity into function, might affect the mutational paths available to the evolving TF-RE complex."

                                "text": "The second scenario we examined was a process of mutually permissive neutral drift by a functional unit of one TF and one RE under purifying selection. Numerous studies have found that a TF and its RE at a regulatory element sometimes diverge in sequence from their ancestral states while maintaining a conserved regulatory association with each other (<a href=\"#bib89\">True and Haag, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Haag and True, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barriere et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lynch and Hagner, 2015</a>). Using the same criteria as above to define a functional complex, we sought to understand whether a single complex of AncSR1:ERE could traverse the joint TF-RE sequence space through a series of changes in the protein and the DNA, reaching AncSR1+RH:SRE along a continuous neutral network without ever losing high-affinity, high-occupancy binding."

These pathways are made possible by intermolecular epistasis, which causes replacements in the TF to alter constraints on evolution of the RE, and vice versa. At the starting point of AncSR1:ERE, both the TF and the RE genotypes are highly constrained by the requirement to maintain a high-affinity complex with each other: only a single mutation is available to the DNA (from GT to GG), and only one replacement (glu25GLY) is available to the protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Drift along each of these pathways has very different functional implications: if the G4 mutation in the RE were to occur first, the neutral network available to the protein would remain unchanged, with glu25GLY remaining as the only viable replacement on the trajectory towards AncSR1+RH. But if glu25GLY were to occur first, the set of viable mutations available to the RE would radically expand, with almost any RE genotype being tolerated. Reaplcement glu25GLY in the TF therefore acts as a permissive substitution for drift by the RE, allowing the DNA binding site to explore many new pathways\u2014including mutation to SREs\u2014while still maintaining an association with the TF. Thus, neutral substitutions in the protein can permit previously unavailable moves by the DNA through its neutral network."

For example, if the complex is in the state GLY-SER-ala:GT, adding the final replacement ala29VAL would lead to a nonfunctional complex. But if the RE were to drift first to one of the SREs, then the complex would be able to tolerate this amino acid change. Further, neutral substitutions in the RE can also restrict evolutionary pathways that were previously open to the TF, making certain amino acid changes inaccessible. For example, if the complex is in the state GLY-gly-VAL:GA, the TF can drift to AncSR1+RH via the gly26SER replacement; however, if the RE first drifts to GC, this replacement would abolish the TF:RE association, making it an unlikely evolutionary step (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

To follow one such example, replacement glu25GLY allows the ancestral ERE (GT) to drift to TT, which prevents gly26SER, which otherwise would have been available, and also permits the previously denied replacement ala29VAL; if ala29VAL does occur next, then mutation of the DNA to TA becomes available, which in turn is permissive for gly26SER. That replacement closes off many DNA mutations that were previously available, but the final mutation to SRE1 or SRE2 is open. Epistasis across the molecular interface therefore makes the evolution of the TF and the RE contingent upon the genotype\u2014and therefore the prior evolutionary history\u2014of its partner. A chain of serially contingent events may ensue, as permissive and restrictive mutations in the protein and DNA open or close evolutionary paths for mutations within the same molecule or its binding partner."

AncSR1:ERE is a highly specific complex that does not recognize SRE; it lies on a narrow peninsula in sequence space, with few mutations leading directly to other functional complexes. A series of permissive mutations in both partners, however, could have allowed the RE and the TF to drift together through numerous new genotypes, eventually reaching AncSR1+RH:SRE, which itself is a specific complex on a narrow peninsula that does not bind or connect directly to ERE."

The criteria that we used to define this mapping are highly simplified. In reality, the selective effects of mutations that change TF:RE interactions are likely to depend on many factors, including the genomic context and role of other TFs in regulating a given target, interactions between the TF and other proteins, the genotype and function of other domains and sites in the TF, the physiological roles of the target genes, and the demographic characteristics of the population. How these factors affected the mapping of affinity onto fitness for the ancient molecular complex we study here is unknown; as a result, the mutational pathways most likely to have been followed during the evolutionary history of the SR DBD and its targets are also unknown. Despite this uncertainty about specific historical scenarios, however, it is clear that rampant epistasis was present at the most fundamental biochemical level, and even the simple biological criteria we imposed resulted in very strong impacts on the evolutionary accessibility of trajectories across sequence space. It therefore seems likely that epistasis will also structure evolutionary trajectories under more complex, realistic conditions that introduce further nonlinearities into the relationship between physical properties and selectable biological outcomes."

But specificity\u2014variation in affinity among REs\u2014appears to be determined by biophysical interactions that are largely unique to each TF-RE combination. For example, replacement ala29VAL improves relative affinity for REs containing A4; in previously published ancestral X-ray crystal structures, the hydrophobic side chain of VAL29 packs against the hydrophobic methyl groups that are unique to the complementary T at position 4 in the RE, providing a likely explanation, at least in part, for this effect (<a href=\"#bib57\">McKeown et al., 2014</a>).

As models become complex, estimates of higher-order determinants of affinity can become uncertain or biased if the estimates of affinity are noisy or imprecise; this problem can be exacerbated if affinities for some sequence states are estimated by interpolation rather than being measured (<a href=\"#bib66\">Otwinowski and Plotkin, 2014</a>). By directly and precisely measuring the \u0394G of binding for all TF:RE combinations, we were able to detect and estimate the magnitude and importance of higher-order epistatic effects with relatively high confidence. Further, because effects on the free energy of binding by independent factors are additive for reversible interactions, these measurements allowed us to use linear regression to rigorously estimate the magnitude and significance of main and epistatic effects on TF-RE recognition. Other metrics such as occupancy or entropy may require more complex descriptive models."

The 128 TF:RE combined genotypes whose affinity we measured represent a tiny slice of the vast joint sequence space of possible TFs and REs. Even within this small region of sequence space, however, we found rampant epistatic interactions within the DNA RE, within the TF protein, and between the RE and the TF. These epistatic interactions play key roles in determining the specificity of binding by each TF, and they strongly shape the functional topology of the joint sequence space and the capacity of each molecule to traverse this space under various evolutionary scenarios. As improving technical capacities allow larger tracts of joint sequence space to be analyzed and higher-level biological functions to be assessed, it seems quite likely that epistasis will be a major influence on the specificity and evolution of molecular complexes."

Previous studies of epistasis within a molecule have shown that interactions among mutations constrict the number of passable evolutionary trajectories through sequence space and make the outcomes of evolution contingent upon the prior occurrence of permissive mutations (<a href=\"#bib96\">Weinreich et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bridgham et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</a>).

Permissive epistatic mutations across the molecular interface open paths for the other molecule that would otherwise have been blocked. As a result, the absolute number of trajectories (and ultimate endpoints) available to either partner is larger than it would appear to be if only the \u2018slice\u2019 or profile through the joint sequence space represented by variability in a single molecule were considered. Under the scenario we examined, for example, an ERE regulated by an immutable AncSR1-DBD could not reach SRE without losing functionality, and AncSR1 could not reach AncSR1+RH if it regulated only immutable binding sites. But because amino acid replacements in the TF are permissive for mutations in the RE, and subsequent RE mutations are permissive for replacements in the protein, both members of the complex can explore regions of their own sequence space and reach genotypes that were not previously available to either."

The extensive intermolecular epistasis that we observed among a small number of sites in a simple binary complex suggests that the reach of intermolecular epistasis may be vast. If the structure of that epistasis is anything like that present in the AncSR1-RE complex, then the web of contingent events that structures evolutionary trajectories is likely to be dense, with the evolutionary potential of any one molecule depending on prior events in other molecules. But if some of those events are permissive, as our results suggest they are likely to be, then the potential of evolution to generate new functional complexes by the combined action of mutation, drift and selection is greater than it may appear if the molecules are viewed only in isolation. Complexity and interdependence not only constrain evolution; they can also buy freedom for the parts of a system to reach new states, if the historical events are right."

We constructed analogous first-, second-, and third-order models using a binary encoding system, in which each variable is 1 if the respective genetic state is at a given position, and 0 otherwise (e.g., glu25 is 1 if there is a glu at position 25, and 0 in all other cases). For higher-order models, the terms were constructed so that they equal 1 if all lower-order genetic states are present (e.g., glu25_G3 is 1 if both site 25 in the RH is a glu and site 3 in the RE is a G, and 0 otherwise). We constructed these linear models by determining the effect of each binary variable relative to the mean \u0394G<sub>dissociation</sub>. We then compared the effect of all the same first- and second-order genetic effects with this approach to our results from <i>abc</i>-/<i>WYK</i>-models and found they were entirely consistent, as expected (<a href=\"#bib85\">Stormo, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Poelwijk et al., 2015</a>)."

Each system was solvated in a cubic box with a 10 \u00c5 margin, then neutralized and brought to 150 mM ionic strength with sodium and chloride ions. This was followed by energy minimization to remove clashes, assignment of initial velocities from a Maxwell distribution, and 1 ns of solvent equilibration in which the positions of heavy protein and DNA atoms were restrained. Production runs were 50 ns, with the initial 10 ns excluded as burn-in. The trajectory time step was 2 fs, and final analyses were performed on frames taken every 12.5 ps."

This part of the space represents the historically relevant portion of the sequence space, because these are the only two positions that vary between the ancestrally preferred RE and the derived preferred RE, and only half-site specificity changed across the functional transition from AncSR1 to AncSR1+RH\u2014not cooperativity or other aspects of dimeric binding. Limiting our study to a relatively small region of multidimensional joint protein+DNA sequence space was necessary for us to exhaustively map function and quantify genetic factors contributing to variation in affinity (we explore these points in the following subsections of the text: \u201cEpistasis across a molecular interface: transcription factors and DNA response elements\u201d, \u201cExploitation of latent binding affinity\u201d and \u201cMethodologies for characterizing epistasis in combined sequence space\u201d)."

Using a linear model is appropriate based on first principles given the fact that total free energy of a system by definition is the sum of the free energy of the factors that contribute to it. The advantage of this model is that it allows the energetic contributions of epistatic interactions to binding to be precisely quantified and the statistical significance of such contributions to be evaluated (please see the subsections \u201cDeterminants of affinity in RE sequence space\u201d, \u201cEffects of amino acid substitutions on affinity\u201d and \u201cEpistasis across a molecular interface\u201d)."
