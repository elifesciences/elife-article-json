Once the pupa starts to form, the ecdysone hormone reduces the production of <i>miR-965</i> to increase histoblast proliferation and migration. The <i>miR-965</i> microRNA in turn reduces the level of ecdysone receptor. The ecdysone hormone acts as an all-or-nothing switch to make an irreversible change from the larval to the pupal stage. The hormone boosts its own activity by increasing expression of its own receptor. This \u2018positive feedback loop\u2019 acts like a switch and is very sensitive to small changes in the amount of hormone present."

This is because the hormone must first overcome the action of <i>miR-965</i> before it can kick off the positive feedback loop. This takes time, and means that any change in the amount of hormone must be around for a while to have an effect. This mechanism buffers against short-lived, small changes in hormone levels that might throw the switch at the wrong time\u2014a feature known as \u2018robustness\u2019. This seems to be a complicated process to go from one state to another (i.e., from a larva to a pupa).

The adult abdominal epithelium is produced from progenitor cells, known as histoblast cells.

Histoblasts are specified in the embryo and lie quiescent throughout larval development (<a href=\"#bib11\">Guerra et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Simcox et al., 1991</a>). There are four pairs of histoblast nests in each segment, which merge to assemble the adult abdominal epidermis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Madhavan and Schneiderman, 1977</a>). The anterior and posterior dorsal histoblast nests give rise to the external dorsal cuticle of the abdominal segments (tergites), while the ventral pair give rise to the ventral cuticle (sternites)."

The proliferative phase is divided into two stages with distinct features (<a href=\"#bib16\">Madhavan and Madhavan, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ninov et al., 2009</a>). The early \u2018division phase\u2019 is characterized by rapid and synchronous cell division without intervening G2 phases to allow for cell growth. Cells double in number and decrease in size with each division, with little change in the size of the nests. This is followed by a phase of slower division, from 15\u201340 hr of pupal development, in which proliferation is accompanied by longer intervening gap phases to allow cell growth. During this phase, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Insulin receptor/PI3K- signaling coordinate the growth of cells with proliferation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ninov et al., 2009</a>). During the growth phase, the histoblast nests begin to spread to replace the LEC. The expansion of the histoblast nests by cell migration is accompanied by programmed cell death, so that larval cells are replaced by the expanding histoblast population to maintain integrity of the epithelium (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bischoff and Cseresnyes, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Nakajima et al., 2011</a>)."

One mutant allele was made by homologous recombination using the pw25 vector (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gong and Golic, 2003</a>). In this allele, the genomic region containing the miRNA hairpin was replaced by a mini-white reporter gene flanked by LoxP sites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, w+KO1). The presence of the intron-containing mini-white marker in the <i>kismet</i> intron was expected to disrupt <i>kismet</i> gene function. Cre-mediated excision of the LoxP-flanked mini-white cassette produced the KO1 allele, in which the miRNA was replaced by a single LoxP site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, w-KO1). A second independent deletion was produced using the pRMCE vector, which was designed to allow subsequent retargeting of the locus using Recombination Mediated Cassette Exchange (RMCE) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Weng et al., 2009</a>). The miRNA hairpin was replaced by a mini-white marker flanked by inverted attP and LoxP sites. The KO2 allele was made by Cre-mediated excision of the LoxP flanked mini-white reporter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, w-KO2). Deletion of the miRNA was verified by quantitative miRNA PCR in animals heteroallelic for the mini-white deleted versions of KO1/KO2 and for the KO2 allele in trans to <i>Df(2L)ED19,</i> a chromosomal deletion that uncovers the <i>kismet</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To produce a genetic rescue allele, we used RMCE to replace the mini-white cassette with a fragment containing the miR-965 hairpin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, 965-Rescue). <i>miR-965</i> expression was restored to normal levels in the 965-Rescue allele (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

To ask whether <i>kismet</i> gene function was compromised in these mini-white excised alleles, we performed molecular and genetic tests. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows RT-PCR to assess splicing of the first <i>kismet</i> intron. A PCR product of normal size was produced in RNA isolated from <i>miR-965</i><sup><i>w-KO1</i></sup>/<i>miR-965</i><sup><i>w-KO2</i></sup> and <i>miR-965</i><sup><i>w-KO2</i></sup>/Df animals. This qualitative assessment was confirmed by quantitative PCR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). <i>kismet</i> transcript levels were not reduced in the <i>miR-965</i><sup><i>w-KO1</i></sup>/<i>miR-965</i><sup><i>w-KO2</i></sup> flies compared to controls, indicating that splicing of intron 1 was not impaired in these mutants.

Note the presence of large polyploid cells in the histoblast nest in the <i>miR-965</i> mutant (arrows). At the start of the imaging period, the large polyploid cells marked by the arrows did not express GFP, but began to express GFP after making contact with the expanding histoblast nests. Possible explanations for the appearance of GFP in large polyploidy cells include (1) induction of esg-Gal4 activity in the larval cells that cannot be eliminated by the expanding histoblast nests, perhaps by signals from the histoblasts; (2) fusion of polyploidy LEC with esg-Gal4-expressing histoblasts.

The level of Wg protein was higher in the <i>miR-965</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Wg is a secreted protein, and its distribution appears to be broader, reaching some of the LECs in the mutant, perhaps reflecting the higher level of protein produced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). To ask whether this elevated Wg expression contributes to the defects in the mutant, we introduced <i>wg</i> mutant alleles into the <i>miR-965</i> (<i>KO1/KO2)</i> mutant background.

The genetic method used to reduce target activity in the mutant background does not allow precise control over the final target level, so this question cannot be addressed.

In light of the relationship between <i>miR-965</i> and <i>string</i>, we asked whether <i>miR-965</i> expression might be under Ecdysone control at this stage. We made use of a UAS-EcR<sup>RNAi</sup> transgene expressed under esg-Gal4 to reduce Ecdysone receptor levels in the histoblasts. RNAi-mediated depletion of <i>EcR</i> mRNA led to an increase in the level of the miR-965 primary transcript and mature miRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and to reduced <i>string</i> mRNA levels in RNA samples isolated from early pupae (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). EcR binding sites have been identified near the host gene, <i>kismet</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gauhar et al., 2009</a>), consistent with the possibility that ecdysone regulates expression of both <i>kismet</i> and <i>miR-965</i>. When <i>miR-965</i> was overexpressed in the histoblast cells using esg-GAL4, <i>string</i> transcript levels were reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and histoblast cell divisions were arrested (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>). This phenotype resembles <i>EcR-B</i> mutants, in which histoblast division is compromised (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bender et al., 1997</a>). Pupae overexpressing <i>miR-965</i> in histoblast cells did not survive beyond \u223c12 APF, so it was not possible to monitor the later stages of histoblast migration in this genotype."

Previous reports have provided evidence that Ecdysone signaling activates <i>string</i> expression to trigger the onset of histoblast proliferation at the beginning of pupal development (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ninov et al., 2009</a>). Our findings provide evidence that Ecdysone signaling works though regulation of <i>miR-965</i>, which in turn regulates <i>string.</i> Interestingly, we also find evidence for negative feedback regulation of <i>miR-965</i> on <i>EcR</i>. Mutual repression circuitry of this type can contribute a switch-like function: EcR activity lowers <i>miR-965</i> activity, which allows greater <i>EcR</i> expression/activity by alleviating <i>miR-965 </i>mediated repression. In a circuit of this design, there will be a delay between reduced transcription of the miRNA primary transcript and the decay of the mature miRNA product. Hence sustained EcR activity is needed to throw the switch."

Positive feedback allows for a sharp switch-like response, but also makes the system very sensitive to stochastic fluctuation in <i>EcR</i> activity. Coupling <i>EcR </i>positive auto-feedback to miRNA-mediated repression allows a robust switch function upon Ecdysone stimulation, while protecting the system from the effects of biological noise. This study provides evidence that <i>miR-965</i> plays an analogous role in regulating <i>EcR</i> response and suggests that <i>miR-965</i> confers robustness to the <i>EcR</i> response in the histoblasts."

Those authors provided evidence that cell growth and the expansion of the histoblast nests may be required to elicit LEC apoptosis. Although the mechanism by which expansion of the histoblasts triggers LEC death is not clear, elevated <i>string</i> expression in the <i>miR-965</i> mutant is likely to be responsible for the cell cycle progression defects during this phase, hindering normal LEC removal and histoblast migration."

Wg levels are normally higher in the posterior region of the anterior histoblast nests and lower more anteriorly. Our finding that Wg levels were elevated and that the distribution of Wg was broader than normal suggests ectopic Wg activity throughout the histoblast nest, including cells that normally experience low Wg levels. Ectopic spread of Wg could be responsible for the formation of ectopic bristles and for the occasional instances of polarity reversal observed in the anterior part of tergites in the <i>miR-965</i> mutants."

Coupling EcR positive feedback to miRNA-mediated mutual repression allows a robust switch function upon Ecdysone stimulation, while protecting the system from the effects of random fluctuation in EcR levels that might otherwise trigger a feedback response.
