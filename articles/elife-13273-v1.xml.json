For example, failure of neural fold fusion during neurulation leads to open neural tube defects including spina bifida. Using mouse embryos, we show that cell protrusions emanating from the apposed neural fold tips, at the interface between the neuroepithelium and the surface ectoderm, are required for completion of neural tube closure. By genetically ablating the cytoskeletal regulators Rac1 or Cdc42 in the dorsal neuroepithelium, or in the surface ectoderm, we show that these protrusions originate from surface ectodermal cells and that Rac1 is necessary for the formation of membrane ruffles which typify late closure stages, whereas Cdc42 is required for the predominance of filopodia in early neurulation. This study provides evidence for the essential role and molecular regulation of membrane protrusions prior to fusion of a key organ primordium in mammalian development."

For example, failure of neural fold fusion during neurulation leads to open neural tube defects including spina bifida. Using mouse embryos, we show that cell protrusions emanating from the apposed neural fold tips, at the interface between the neuroepithelium and the surface ectoderm, are required for completion of neural tube closure. By genetically ablating the cytoskeletal regulators Rac1 or Cdc42 in the dorsal neuroepithelium, or in the surface ectoderm, we show that these protrusions originate from surface ectodermal cells and that Rac1 is necessary for the formation of membrane ruffles which typify late closure stages, whereas Cdc42 is required for the predominance of filopodia in early neurulation. This study provides evidence for the essential role and molecular regulation of membrane protrusions prior to fusion of a key organ primordium in mammalian development."

Understanding the mechanisms by which the vertebrate neural plate folds up and fuses to form a closed neural tube is thus of paramount importance for gaining insight into the embryonic pathogenesis of NTDs, and for developing improved methods for their prevention. In recent years, some of the molecular mechanisms underlying different morphogenetic aspects of neural tube closure have been unravelled. For example, the initial convergence and extension movements that narrow and elongate the neural plate were found to be regulated by the non-canonical Wnt-planar cell polarity pathway (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wallingford and Harland, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Williams et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007b</a>), whereas the subsequent bending of the mammalian neural plate at discrete medial and dorsolateral hinge points was shown to be regulated by Shh and BMP signalling (<a href=\"#bib82\">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007a</a>). Much less is known, however, about the final steps of neurulation, involving fusion and remodelling of the neural folds at the dorsal midline."

Neural tube closure involves a particular kind of epithelial fusion, in which two distinct tissues need to fuse and remodel: the pseudostratified neuroepithelium (NE) and the squamous surface ectoderm (SE). Initially, these two tissues form a continuous ectodermal layer; however, during neural fold fusion, the continuity of this epithelium is disrupted at the bilateral NE/SE junctions, and new adhesions form between concurring epithelia from each side. Remodelling then generates the closed neural tube covered by the future epidermis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Cellular protrusions are often observed prior to apposition at the onset of epithelial fusion events (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pai et al., 2012</a>). It has long been known that membrane ruffles are present at the edges of apposed neural folds during neural tube closure in amphibians (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mak, 1978</a>), birds (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bancroft and Bellairs, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schoenwolf, 1979</a>), and mammals (<a href=\"#bib23\">Geelen and Langman, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Waterman, 1976</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Recently, filopodia have been observed at the neural fold tips in mice (<a href=\"#bib42\">Massarwa and Niswander, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pyrgaki et al., 2010</a>) and in ascidians (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ogura et al., 2011</a>), together with F-actin enrichment along the NE/SE boundary (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hashimoto et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ogura et al., 2011</a>). Early morphological studies in mice found that the initial contact between neural folds in the midbrain and hindbrain regions is made by SE cells, from which cellular protrusions emanate, whereas at the forebrain level initial contact is made by NE cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geelen and Langman, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">1979</a>). In chick, during cranial neurulation the SE and NE layers contact at the same time, but in the spinal region this first contact is made by SE cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schoenwolf, 1979</a>), and in frog neurulation the SE closes first, and this closure is actually uncoupled from NE closure, which occurs later (<a href=\"#bib15\">Davidson and Keller, 1999</a>). In mouse spinal neural tube closure, however, the cell type of origin of the protrusive cells and initial contact point have not been previously identified. Moreover, whether these protrusions are required for vertebrate neural tube closure at any level of the body axis is unknown."

Rac1 induces the formation of the branched actin networks that underlie lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, and Cdc42 drives the assembly of unbranched actin bundles that form filopodia (<a href=\"#bib32\">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ridley, 2011</a>). Even though the specific roles of the different Rho-GTPases were initially described using constitutively active and/or dominant negative forms, as well as pharmacological approaches, these techniques were later recognised to create limitations, owing to issues with specificity and dosage control.

Furthermore, we show that Rac1 regulates the formation of ruffles, without which neurulation fails leading to open spina bifida, whereas Cdc42 is implicated in the formation of filopodia during earlier stages of neurulation."

TEM provides very detailed imaging of both the cellular protrusions and the cells they emanate from. However, the sectional views obtained with TEM do not allow for a three-dimensional analysis of protrusive morphology. We therefore initially chose to describe the protrusive activity in the mouse spinal neural folds using SEM. We observed elaborate membrane protrusions at the point of fold apposition throughout spinal neurulation, and these protrusions were found to vary qualitatively as neurulation progressed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). At the onset of neural tube closure (somite-stage (ss)7), protrusions consisted mainly of long, finger-like filopodia (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As neurulation progressed (e.g. ss12), we observed a mixture of filopodia and ruffles at the spinal fusion point (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). By late spinal neurulation stages (from ss24 onwards), membrane ruffles only were observed, devoid of filopodial extensions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In some cases, cell protrusions were seen not only at the fold apposition point, but also along the edges of both open neural folds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For consistency in the analysis between different embryos, we have focussed our analysis of protrusion types solely on the activity seen at the fold apposition point (for further details of protrusive analysis, see 'Materials and methods' section and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">3</a>)."

Knock-outs of both <i>Rac1</i> and <i>Cdc42</i> are embryonic lethal before neurulation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sugihara et al., 1998</a>), and therefore, analysing their role in neural tube closure required the generation of conditional knock-out mice. We initially chose to conditionally ablate these GTPases by recombining floxed alleles of either <i>Rac1</i> or <i>Cdc42</i> with Cre recombinase expressed under the control of the <i>Pax3</i> promoter. Pax3 is a transcription factor expressed in the dorsal-most cells of the developing neural plate and neural tube from early neurulation stages (embryonic day (E)8.5) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Goulding et al., 1991</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To confirm effective Cre-driven recombination at the appropriate tissues and stages, we crossed <i>Pax3<sup>Cre/+</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Engleka et al., 2005</a>) with a homozygous ROSA26-EYFP reporter line (<a href=\"#bib62\">Srinivas et al., 2001</a>). As expected, YFP was expressed in the dorsal NE from E8.5 onwards (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), with some YFP-expressing cells also detected ventral to the Pax3 expression domain, consistent with recent findings (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moore et al., 2013</a>). Surprisingly, however, at neurulation stages later than ss20, we also detected YFP expression in cells of the dorsal SE, mainly those directly in contact with the NE of the open neural folds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In confirmation of their SE identity, we found that these cells robustly express E-cadherin, whereas Pax3 was expressed only at very low intensity, or not at all (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Comparing the types of protrusions formed by Non-Cre and Pax3Cre-Con embryos did not reveal a difference between the two groups (p=0.44). Nonetheless, because Pax3 is known to regulate the cytoskeleton in osteogenic cells, and Rac1 activity is required for this function (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wiggan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wiggan and Hamel, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wiggan et al., 2006</a>), we also investigated protrusions in the <i>Pax3</i> mutant mouse <i>Sp<sup>2H</sup></i>, which contains a 32bp deletion in the <i>Pax3</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib20\">Epstein et al., 1991</a>). No differences were observed between the protrusions of wild-type, heterozygous and <i>Sp<sup>2H</sup></i> mutant embryos (data available in doi:10.5061/dryad.rm660). We conclude that <i>Pax3</i> heterozygosity does not affect protrusion formation; from here onwards, the protrusion analysis utilised a single category of Controls, comprising pooled Non-Cre and Pax3Cre-Con embryos."

These observations are consistent with the failure or delay in PNP closure seen in Pax3Cre-Rac1 embryos resulting from a defect in cell protrusive activity at late neurulation stages.

Nevertheless, because Rac1 is required for the formation of adherens junctions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ehrlich et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kovacs et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</a>), we analysed the localisation of F-actin and \u03b2-catenin in the NE of Pax3Cre-Rac1 mutants, as well as E-cadherin in the SE. The distribution of these proteins was found to be closely similar in control and mutant embryos, as well as in both the targeted and non-targeted regions of the NE in mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), thus ruling out an effect of Rac1 knock-out on epithelial stability, which could impair neural tube closure."

The size of the spina bifida lesions and the timing of failure of PNP closure in <i>ct/ct</i> embryos are similar to those in Pax3Cre-Rac1 embryos. Furthermore, the PNP defect in <i>ct/ct</i> embryos is known to be caused by a defect of cell proliferation in the hindgut, leading to excessive curvature of the body axis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brook et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Copp et al., 1988</a>), and hence is unlikely to be related to protrusion and fusion events at the neural fold tips."

Rac1 might be required for the formation of ruffles that are devoid of filopodia, but not for the combined appearance of ruffles and filopodia. These ruffles without filopodia might be needed only for late spinal NT closure. Alternatively, it is possible that Rac1 is required for neural fold protrusions along the whole spinal axis throughout all NT closure stages, but these protrusions arise on SE cells, and so Rac1-dependency is seen only at late neurulation stages, when the Pax3 lineage becomes targeted in the SE as well as the NE (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To address the first hypothesis, and to test a possible candidate for the formation of filopodia, we generated conditional Cdc42 mutants in the Pax3 cell lineage (Pax3Cre-Cdc42). None of the Pax3Cre-Cdc42 embryos showed NTDs (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Moreover, Pax3Cre-Cdc42 embryos collected during neurulation between ss16 and ss27 resembled control litter mates in PNP length (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The proportions of protrusion types at mid (ss15-22) and late (ss23-30) neurulation did not differ between Pax3Cre-Cdc42 and control embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). These results suggest that the protrusions seen at earlier neurulation stages are either regulated independently of both Rac1 and Cdc42, or may emanate from SE rather than NE cells."

These small GTPases are required in the neural crest for proper development of structures including craniofacial primordia, dorsal root ganglia, and the cardiac outflow tract septum (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fuchs et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Thomas et al., 2010</a>). The Pax3 lineage encompasses the neural crest population (<a href=\"#bib19\">Engleka et al., 2005</a>), and therefore defects in neural crest derivatives were expected in both Pax3Cre-Rac1 and Pax3Cre-Cdc42 embryos. Embryos of both genotypes were dead by E13.5 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), as expected in cases of defective outflow tract septation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Conway et al., 1997</a>).

However, since Cre recombination also occurred in dorsal NE cells in Pax3Cre lines, and in scattered NE cells in Grhl3Cre lines, we could not rule out a role of Rac1 in the NE. To resolve this issue, we performed a further experiment to test specifically whether Rac1 function in NE cells may mediate cell protrusions and neural tube closure. We used Nkx1-2Cre-ERT2 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2016</a>)\u00a0to generate Nkx1-2Cre-Rac1 embryos in which <i>Rac1\u00a0</i>was conditionally inactivated solely in NE cells. <i>Nkx1-2,</i> also known as <i>Sax1,</i> is a homeobox gene expressed in the posterior neural tube (<a href=\"#bib60\">Schubert et al., 1995</a>). In situ\u00a0hybridisation confirmed that <i>Nkx1-2</i> is expressed solely in the closing PNP of E9.5 embryos (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), with transcripts detectable only in the NE (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Using the ROSA26-EYFP reporter, we confirmed that Nkx1-2Cre drives recombination in the NE of the PNP and previously closed neural tube (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), whereas there is no recombination in the SE (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Nkx1-2Cre-Rac1 embryos developed entirely normally, and did not display NTDs (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Moreover, they formed normal ruffles typical of late neurulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>).

To test the role of Cdc42 in the formation of filopodia in early neurulation, we conditionally ablated <i>Cdc42</i> predominantly in the SE lineage, using Grhl3Cre. The <i>Grhl3</i> and <i>Cdc42</i> genes are located less than 2 Mb apart on mouse chromosome 4 (<a href=\"www.ensembl.org\">www.ensembl.org</a>), and therefore have less than 2% chance of recombination.

The present work is, to our knowledge, the first to provide evidence that these protrusions are required for successful neural tube closure. Moreover, we show that as spinal neurulation progresses these cell protrusions change, both qualitatively and in their genetic regulation. At the onset of neurulation, the protrusions are predominantly filopodial, requiring Cdc42 function, whereas later stages are characterised by either a mixture of ruffles and filopodia, or by membrane ruffles alone, and these require Rac1. Additionally, using both genetic experiments and morphological analysis, we show that the protrusions originate from SE cells rather than NE cells."

For example, during palatal shelf fusion in mice, filopodia are present at the medial edge epithelial cells just before fusion, and <i>TGF</i>-\u03b2<i>3</i> knock-out mice that lack such protrusions display cleft palate (<a href=\"#bib66\">Taya et al., 1999</a>). Similarly, during eyelid closure, filopodia extend from the leading edge epithelia and are reduced in number and length in <i>c-jun</i> mutants that display defective eyelid closure (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zenz et al., 2003</a>). But perhaps the best studied case of cell protrusive activity in epithelial fusion during development is the process of dorsal closure in <i>Drosophila</i>. In this system, the leading edge cells of the lateral epidermis extend cell protrusions as they advance over the amnioserosa layer. When Rac or Cdc42 functions are perturbed, using dominant-negative proteins or loss-of-function mutations, this leads to defects of lamellipodia or filopodia, respectively, accompanied by failed dorsal closure, as well as misalignment of any segments that manage to close (<a href=\"#bib28\">Harden et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jacinto et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Woolner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2002</a>). This suggests that in <i>Drosophila,</i> these protrusions may have a dual role, both in terms of mechanically participating in the closure process, and as exploratory structures that assure proper matching of fusing segments. However, because Rac is also involved in contraction of the underlying amnioserosa cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Harden et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">2002</a>), it is possible that its role in the leading edge cells is mainly exploratory."

Moreover, in the segmented epidermis of the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, exact alignment of A-P segments appears vital and is sub-served by the epithelial protrusions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Millard and Martin, 2008</a>). In contrast, the mouse developing spinal cord is not overtly segmented and it would appear that the role of neural fold protrusions is more likely to involve cell-cell recognition and/or signalling across the midline, to initiate epithelial fusion and ensure robust closure of the neural tube."

However, Rac1 is required in the SE earlier on, as Grhl3Cre-Rac1 mutants show delayed PNP closure from ss20, and a lack of ruffles alone in these mutants is detected at ss15-22, despite no overall statistical significance. This argues for a requirement of ruffles from at least mid-neurulation, and perhaps a gradual transition between protrusive types, with a balance of different protrusions needed."

                                "text": "Despite the lack of ruffles, the shift towards excessive filopodia formation in Grhl3Cre-Rac1 mutants was unexpected given that, in cultured fibroblasts, expression of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 leads to inhibition of filopodia (<a href=\"#bib36\">Johnston et al., 2008</a>). Fibroblasts genetically deficient for Rac1, on the other hand, are able to spread and move by extending filopodia, possibly through an Arp2/3-independent process (<a href=\"#bib63\">Steffen et al., 2013</a>). Filopodial initiation can be driven by either Arp2/3 (branched nucleation) or by formins (unbranched nucleation) (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yang and Svitkina, 2011</a>). Moreover, Rac1 can both activate and inhibit the Arp2/3 complex, through either the Scar/WAVE complex or the Arpin protein, respectively (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dang et al., 2013</a>). If filopodium formation on the leading edge SE cells occurs through an Arp2/3-dependent process, then in the absence of Rac1 perhaps initiation of filopodial extension can be driven by other activators of the Arp2/3 complex. The occurrence of filopodia initiation would then be enhanced if Rac1 activates an Arp2/3 inhibitor such as Arpin in these cells. On the other hand, if initiation of these filopodia is driven independently of Arp2/3, then the absence of Rac1 might shift the balance from branched to unbranched actin nucleation, resulting in more actin filaments being incorporated into filopodium-forming cross linked bundles."

But Cdc42 does play a role in early neurulation, as Grhl3Cre-Cdc42 mutants show a shift towards the extension of ruffles at the expense of filopodia. Whether or not this would impair progression of neural tube closure past ss10 could not be determined, given the early lethality of these embryos. It is possible that, in the absence/reduction of filopodia, membrane ruffles could take over their role and closure would progress. In fact, mutant mice for Ena/VASP proteins (actin regulators involved in filopodium formation) successfully close their PNP despite having cranial neural tube closure defects (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kwiatkowski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lanier et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Menzies et al., 2004</a>), arguing that filopodia are dispensable for spinal neurulation."

However, after being unable to find in the literature any convincing examples of such detection at stages earlier than E11, and in view of the insensitivity of the antibodies we have tried, we concluded that this approach would be unfeasible and that protein reduction could probably only be shown by western blotting. Given that we are dealing with conditional KOs, not all cells in an embryonic structure (e.g. caudal embryonic region) would be expected to show protein knockdown. Moreover, it would be unfeasible to precisely dissect out cells of the Pax3Cre domain. In a previous study using qRT-PCR on dissected PNP regions of E9.5 embryos (the same region we would analyse) (Zhao et al., 2014), conditional KO of \u03b2-catenin using the Pax3Cre driver led to a reduction of only about 20% of mRNA levels. Therefore, an approach to this question using western blotting would suffer from the need to detect knockdown of Rac1 in a minority of cells within the dissected samples. We consider that the large number of embryos required to have a chance of detecting such small levels of protein reduction in the different conditional knockouts, and at the different neurulation stages, would be prohibitive in terms of cost and time."

We would like to point out, however, that the prospective neural crest region, at the axial level we have analysed, is pre-migratory. Neural crest cells do not migrate out of the spinal region until at least 12 hours after neural tube closure is completed (Erickson and Weston, 1983), therefore making it unlikely that cells at the point of neural tube closure have yet begun to undergo EMT. Nonetheless, we accept that these could be highly modified NE cells and have now changed our interpretation accordingly at the end of the Results section."
