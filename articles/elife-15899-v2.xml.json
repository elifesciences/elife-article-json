These proteins undergo three coordinated COOH-terminal events: isoprenylation of the cysteine, proteolytic removal of <i>aaX</i>, and COOH-terminal methylation. Here, we investigated the coupling of these modifications in the context of the yeast Ydj1p chaperone. We provide genetic, biochemical, and biophysical evidence that the Ydj1p <i>CaaX</i> motif is isoprenylated but not cleaved and carboxylmethylated. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ydj1p-dependent thermotolerance and Ydj1p localization are perturbed when alternative <i>CaaX</i> motifs are transplanted onto Ydj1p. The abnormal phenotypes revert to normal when post-isoprenylation events are genetically interrupted. Our findings indicate that proper Ydj1p function requires an isoprenylatable <i>CaaX</i> motif that is resistant to post-isoprenylation events. These results expand on the complexity of protein isoprenylation and highlight the impact of post-isoprenylation events in regulating the function of Ydj1p and perhaps other <i>CaaX</i> proteins."

These proteins undergo three coordinated COOH-terminal events: isoprenylation of the cysteine, proteolytic removal of <i>aaX</i>, and COOH-terminal methylation. Here, we investigated the coupling of these modifications in the context of the yeast Ydj1p chaperone. We provide genetic, biochemical, and biophysical evidence that the Ydj1p <i>CaaX</i> motif is isoprenylated but not cleaved and carboxylmethylated. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ydj1p-dependent thermotolerance and Ydj1p localization are perturbed when alternative <i>CaaX</i> motifs are transplanted onto Ydj1p. The abnormal phenotypes revert to normal when post-isoprenylation events are genetically interrupted. Our findings indicate that proper Ydj1p function requires an isoprenylatable <i>CaaX</i> motif that is resistant to post-isoprenylation events. These results expand on the complexity of protein isoprenylation and highlight the impact of post-isoprenylation events in regulating the function of Ydj1p and perhaps other <i>CaaX</i> proteins."

They are defined by a COOH-terminal <i>CaaX</i> motif where <i>C</i> is cysteine, <i>a</i> is typically an aliphatic amino acid, and <i>X</i> can be one of several residues. In some publications, the <i>CaaX</i> motif is referred to as a <i>CXXX</i> motif due to its highly degenerate nature (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kinsella et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fu and Casey, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Young et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wright et al., 2006</a>)."

The first modification is C15 (farnesyl) or C20 (geranylgeranyl) isoprenylation of the cysteine (<i>C</i>) by cytosolic isoprenyltransferases. This is followed by endoproteolysis to remove the COOH-terminal tripeptide (<i>aaX</i>). Rce1p and Ste24p are proteases that can independently mediate this activity, but the promiscuous nature of Ste24p suggests that <i>CaaX</i> proteolysis is not likely its primary duty (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boyartchuk et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tam et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ast et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hildebrandt et al., 2016</a>). The isoprenylated cysteine revealed by proteolysis is carboxylmethylated by an isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT/Ste14p). The <i>CaaX</i> proteases and ICMT are all integral, multi-pass membrane proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Romano et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schmidt et al., 1998</a>). In some instances, additional modifications occur to <i>CaaX</i> proteins. Common examples are palmitoylation of mammalian H-Ras and N-Ras, and additional proteolysis of precursors to yeast <b>a</b>-factor and lamin A. The modifications occurring to <i>CaaX</i> proteins often impact their function and/or localization, and intense interest is focused on developing therapeutic inhibitors against all enzymatic steps associated with <i>CaaX</i> protein modification (<i>e.g.</i> farnesyltransferase inhibitors; FTIs) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Silvius, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Winter-Vann and Casey, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Berndt et al., 2011</a>)."

Whereas these proteins certainly undergo the ordered set of post-translational modifications described above, several lines of evidence support the existence of a shunt pathway that yields partially modified products. Mammalian Rab38 (CAKS <i>CaaX</i> motif) is farnesylated, but not carboxylmethylated, implying that it is not cleaved (<a href=\"#bib33\">Leung et al., 2007</a>). The \u03b1 (CAMQ) and \u03b2 (CVLS) subunits of phosphorylase b kinase (Phk) are farnesylated yet retain their <i>CaaX</i> motifs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heilmeyer et al., 1992</a>). The major form of G\u03b35 (CSFL) is geranylgeranylated and also retains its <i>CaaX</i> motif (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kilpatrick and Hildebrandt, 2007</a>). Additionally, mammalian annexin A2 (CGGDD) was identified in a screen for isoprenylated proteins. Its non-canonical length motif suggests that it may not be cleaved (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kho et al., 2004</a>). Detailed follow-up studies of these observations have not been reported, and the relevance of interrupted processing to protein function has not been investigated."

Ydj1p is a yeast homolog of DnaJ, an <i>E. coli</i> heat shock protein (<a href=\"#bib11\">Caplan and Douglas, 1991</a>). The homology between Ydj1p and DnaJ lies predominantly in the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (<a href=\"#bib11\">Caplan and Douglas, 1991</a>); DnaJ does not possess a <i>CaaX</i> motif. Heat shock proteins generally function in protein folding, transport, and assembly (<a href=\"#bib44\">Qiu et al., 2006</a>). Among its many reported roles in yeast, Ydj1p functions with Hsp70s of the Ssa class to mediate the\u00a0transfer of preproteins across mitochondrial and ER membranes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Caplan and Douglas, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Atencio and Yaffe, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Becker et al., 1996</a>). Ydj1p is also required for growth at elevated temperature (<a href=\"#bib12\">Caplan et al., 1992</a>). Farnesylation of Ydj1p is specifically required for growth at elevated temperatures, the\u00a0suppression of certain prions, and maturation of Hsp90 client proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Caplan et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Summers et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Flom et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sharma et al., 2009</a>). The roles of proteolysis and carboxylmethylation in regulating these activities have not previously been investigated. We report here that the yeast Hsp40 chaperone Ydj1p is a <i>CaaX</i> protein that avoids post-isoprenylation proteolysis and carboxylmethylation. We also demonstrate that there are negative consequences to Ydj1p function and localization if it is forced to undergo post-isoprenylation modification. These observations expand on the complexity of protein isoprenylation and are expected to provide a better understanding of the roles of the <i>CaaX</i> proteases and ICMT in regulating the function of <i>CaaX</i> proteins."

Using a qualitative plate growth assay, we observed as previously reported that yeast fail to grow at elevated temperatures in the absence of Ydj1p (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; vector). Expression of wildtype Ydj1p (CASQ) reversed this phenotype and allowed growth at elevated temperature.

Unmodified Ydj1p (SASQ; open triangle) has slower mobility than farnesylated Ydj1p (closed triangle). Values to the left of the image indicate the migration of protein standards (kDa).

At the onset of this study, we expected that altering the <i>CaaX</i> motif of Ydj1p would yield phenotypes matching that of either farnesylated or unmodified Ydj1p (<i>i.e.</i> CASQ and SASQ phenotypes respectively). We further expected farnesylated forms of Ydj1p to be cleaved and carboxylmethylated at the COOH-terminus. We observed an intermediate phenotype, however, when we evaluated Ydj1p mutants containing the <i>CaaX</i> motifs from <b>a</b>-factor (CVIA) and the Ste18p G\u03b3 subunit (CTLM). These Ydj1p <i>CaaX</i> mutants developed normal colony size at 37\u00b0C, indicative of isoprenylation, but grew poorly at 40\u00b0C relative to wildtype Ydj1p. The growth defect at 40\u00b0C was more pronounced than just a smaller colony size. There were fewer colonies per spot relative to farnesylated Ydj1p (CASQ) and additional colonies did not appear after prolonged growth at elevated temperature. It should be mentioned that the <i>CaaX</i> motifs compared were purposefully chosen. In the context of <b>a</b>-factor, the CASQ motif is recognized as being Ste24p-specific, CTLM is Rce1p-specific, and CVIA is cleaved by both proteases (<a href=\"#bib58\">Trueblood et al., 2000</a>); this target specificity is species-independent (<a href=\"#bib43\">Plummer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cadi\u00f1anos et al., 2003</a>)."

For SASQ, we expected loss of isoprenylation. For the others, we expected either reduced farnesylation or alternative geranylgeranylation. To assess the isoprenylation status of the Ydj1p mutants, we took advantage of the observation that farnesylation increases the SDS-PAGE mobility of Ydj1p (<a href=\"#bib12\">Caplan et al., 1992</a>). Lysates from the same strains used for the thermotolerance assay were evaluated by immunoblot, which revealed that SASQ was indeed unmodified while CTLM and CVIA were fully farnesylated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Moreover, the expression levels of the <i>CaaX</i> variants appeared similar. The <i>ram1</i> genetic background was used to generate unmodified Ydj1p for comparison; <i>RAM1</i> encodes the \u03b2 subunit of the farnesyl isoprenyltransferase. The <i>ram1</i> strain contains a chromosomal copy of <i>YDJ1</i> that contributes a small amount of immunoreactive signal in each of the <i>ram1</i> samples; the contribution was calculated to be approximately 25% of the total signal in plasmid-transformed strains though comparison of serially diluted samples (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). It is important to note that the cultures for the extracts evaluated by immunoblotting were prepared at permissive temperature (25\u00b0C). Thus, it remains formally possible that reduced thermotolerance could result from poor farnesylation of CTLM and CVIA sequences at higher temperatures. We find this unlikely based on evidence that these motifs are still farnesylated at higher temperature when using a genetic background that allows growth at 40\u00b0C (see below and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We took advantage of this observation to examine the impact of alternative Ydj1p <i>CaaX</i> motifs on this phenotype. By comparison to a vector control, strains over-expressing Ydj1p (CASQ) or non-prenylated Ydj1p (SASQ) yielded slightly smaller colonies after a fixed time of incubation on selective solid media and a 2-fold increase in liquid culture doubling time in both the presence and absence of <i>STE14</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; compare vector with CASQ and SASQ). These observations suggest that farnesylation and post-isoprenylation modification are not a contributing factor to the negative impact of over-expressed Ydj1p.

In the context of the <b>a</b>-factor reporter, the CVIA naturally present on <b>a</b>-factor is cleaved by both proteases, whereas CTLM is Rce1p-specific, and CASQ is Ste24p-specific (<a href=\"#bib58\">Trueblood et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Plummer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cadi\u00f1anos et al., 2003</a>). Yet, our findings indicate that the CASQ motif is not cleaved in the context of Ydj1p. To reconcile these observations, we considered that cleavage of CASQ was either context-specific or an over-interpretation of <b>a</b>-factor-based results. The latter seemed more likely given that previous studies, including our own, typically used over-expression systems and/or highly sensitized methods for detection of <b>a</b>-factor bioactivity (<a href=\"#bib58\">Trueblood et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Plummer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cadi\u00f1anos et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Marcus et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Huyer et al., 2006</a>). Thus, we decided to re-investigate the impact of the CASQ motif on <b>a</b>-factor production using conditions that minimize over-expression effects.

In this genetic test, the formation of mating products (<i>i.e.</i> diploid colonies) is directly related to <b>a</b>-factor production, which must be farnesylated, cleaved, and carboxylmethylated in order to be secreted and function as a mating signal. Using similar inputs of <i>MAT</i><b>a</b> cells capable of producing <b>a</b>-factor, the pattern of diploid formation was similar in the context of the natural <b>a</b>-factor sequence (CVIA) whether Rce1p or Ste24p was used to drive pheromone production. A similar pattern was observed for Rce1p-dependent mating in the context of CTLM. Fewer diploid colonies, however, appeared for Ste24p-dependent mating in the context of CASQ, indicative of reduced <b>a</b>-factor production. Because the protease and <b>a</b>-factor genes (<i>RCE1, STE24, MFA1</i>) were slightly over-expressed through the\u00a0use of <i>CEN</i>-based plasmids in this experiment, we re-evaluated <b>a</b>-factor production in the context of the chromosomal genes for the proteases (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This analysis revealed no differences in diploid production for the CVIA and Rce1-dependent CTLM conditions, but much fewer diploids were evident for the Ste24p-dependent CASQ condition. An analysis of mating efficiencies for these strains revealed that <b>a</b>-factor (CASQ) was approximately 1% as effective as <b>a</b>-factor (CVIA) and the CTLM variant. Since the <b>a</b>-factor gene was encoded on a <i>CEN</i>-based plasmid, we expect that mating efficiency observed for <b>a</b>-factor (CASQ) is still an over-estimate.

Our study adds Ydj1p the list of shunted proteins, but importantly, it is the first to associate a negative impact on cellular processes when a shunted protein is forced to undergo post-isoprenylation processing (i.e. proteolysis and carboxylmethylation). This implies, for Ydj1p at least, that a retained <i>CaaX</i> motif is a critical feature necessary for optimal function of the protein. There is a high degree of sequence conservation within the <i>CaaX</i> motif for the DNAJA2 chaperone family, to which Ydj1p belongs (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

Limited alanine-scanning site-directed mutagenesis of Ydj1p has not revealed a single amino acid within or immediately adjacent to the motif that is critical for shunting (Kim and Schmidt, unpublished observations). By comparison, similar studies of the shunted protein G\u03b35 (CSFL) suggest that the presence of an aromatic residue at the <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> or <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> position of the <i>CaaX</i> motif is the feature that reduces cleavage efficiency (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kilpatrick and Hildebrandt, 2007</a>).

Moreover, we have observed that the CASQ and CTSQ <i>CaaX</i> motifs support similar phenotypes in the context of both Ydj1p and <b>a</b>-factor (<i>i.e.</i> poorly cleaved), implying that the <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> position can be something other than aliphatic in nature ([<a href=\"#bib43\">Plummer et al., 2006]</a>; Hildebrandt and Schmidt, unpublished observation).

PrD over-expression strains were cultured in liquid selective media to saturation, serially diluted, and spotted as for temperature sensitivity assays, except that dilutions were into H<sub>2</sub>O, spots (7.5 \u00b5l) were onto SC-Ura/Leu and SGal-Ura/Leu, and incubations were at 30\u00b0C. PrD-GFP strains were cultured to mid-log, and lysates prepared as previously described (<a href=\"#bib54\">Summers et al., 2009</a>). In brief, cells were mechanically broken by vortexing with silica beads in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1x protease inhibitor mixture (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL), crude lysates clarified by centrifugation (1000 xg, 5 min), and clarified samples assayed for total protein concentration. A portion of each lysate (10 \u00b5g total protein) was analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with either Ydj1p or GFP antibody. An additional portion (100 \u00b5g total protein) was incubated with Ydj1p antibody and immune complexes recovered using Protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Science, Pittsburg, PA). Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with GFP antibody. Immunoprecipitated Ydj1p could not be visualized because it was obscured by the presence of the\u00a0antibody heavy chain that co-migrated with Ydj1p on the gel."

Primarily relying on genetic methods in yeast, the authors show that the natural C-terminal sequence CASQ of Ydj1p in yeast is farnesylated but not proteolyzed or carboxymethylated. They show that Ydj1p farnesylation is critical for function (based on results with the SASQ mutant) but that forced proteolysis and carboxymethylation by substituting with C-terminal sequences from a-factor or Ste18p disrupt Ydj1p function as evidenced by thermotolerance differences. They also show that CASQ processing is context dependent (i.e. different with protease overexpression and presence in a-factor). The work appears carefully done and rigorous and is the first clear demonstration that prenylation without further processing is a biological requirement for at least one protein."

The possibility that the natural Ydj1p <i>CaaX</i> motif interacts with specific \u2018readers\u2019 is an intriguing possibility. We first investigated, as suggested, whether interactions between Ydj1p <i>CaaX</i> mutants and specific client proteins were disrupted. But, it was unclear to us why investigations of GDI and Yip1 were promoted, since we are not aware of evidence (genetic, physical, published) that these proteins interact with Ydj1p. Instead, we chose to investigate the interaction between Ydj1p and the prion domain of Rnq1p (PrD), which is known to be dependent on farnesylated Ydj1p. We confirmed the previously reported farnesyl-dependency but did not observe altered interactions for Ydj1p <i>CaaX</i> mutants despite using multiple technical approaches, including co-IP and genetic analyses. These results are now reported as an additional figure (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We also investigated the interaction between Ydj1p and the glutamine-rich fragment of Htt and observed no differences with <i>CaaX</i> mutants. Lastly, we evaluated expression of Axl1p whose mRNA and protein levels are dependent on Ydj1p (Meacham et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1999, 274:34396-34402). We observed reduced levels of Axl1p in the absence of Ydj1p (<i>i.e. ydj1</i>\u2206) but not for any of the Ydj1p <i>CaaX</i> mutants, including Ydj1p SASQ. The Htt and Axl1p results are mentioned in the text but not reported in figure format. Of the considerable number of other genetic and physical interactors reported for Ydj1p (over 400 unique interactors on the <i>Saccharomyces</i> Genome Database), we expect that a case-by-case approach could eventually yield an appropriate \u201creader\u201d. But, extensive case-by-case analyses and/or more appropriate global analyses would have quickly expanded our effort beyond the scope and timeframe of this current study. In our opinion, our negative results for interaction studies do not weaken our conclusion that the shunt pathway is functionally relevant for certain <i>CaaX</i> proteins."
