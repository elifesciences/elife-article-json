We address the organization and functional roles of MICOS and identify two independent MICOS subcomplexes: Mic27/Mic10/Mic12, whose assembly is dependent on respiratory complexes and the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin, and Mic60/Mic19, which assembles independent of these factors. Our data suggest that MICOS subcomplexes independently localize to cristae junctions and are connected via Mic19, which functions to regulate subcomplex distribution, and thus, potentially also cristae junction copy number. MICOS subunits have non-redundant functions as the absence of both MICOS subcomplexes results in more severe morphological and respiratory growth defects than deletion of single MICOS subunits or subcomplexes. Mitochondrial defects resulting from MICOS loss are caused by misdistribution of respiratory complexes in the inner membrane. Together, our data are consistent with a model where MICOS, mitochondrial lipids and respiratory complexes coordinately build a functional and correctly shaped mitochondrial inner membrane."

We address the organization and functional roles of MICOS and identify two independent MICOS subcomplexes: Mic27/Mic10/Mic12, whose assembly is dependent on respiratory complexes and the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin, and Mic60/Mic19, which assembles independent of these factors. Our data suggest that MICOS subcomplexes independently localize to cristae junctions and are connected via Mic19, which functions to regulate subcomplex distribution, and thus, potentially also cristae junction copy number. MICOS subunits have non-redundant functions as the absence of both MICOS subcomplexes results in more severe morphological and respiratory growth defects than deletion of single MICOS subunits or subcomplexes. Mitochondrial defects resulting from MICOS loss are caused by misdistribution of respiratory complexes in the inner membrane. Together, our data are consistent with a model where MICOS, mitochondrial lipids and respiratory complexes coordinately build a functional and correctly shaped mitochondrial inner membrane."

The inner mitochondrial membrane has the highest density of protein in the cell and is differentiated into three distinct interconnected domains: the boundary region, which are flattened membranes that lie in close apposition to the outer membrane; cristae membranes, which are lamellar invaginations with highly curved edges; and cristae junctions, which are relatively narrow tubules that connect cristae to the boundary membrane and may act as a physical partitioning mechanism that prevents and/or regulates the intermixing of proteins between cristae and the boundary domains (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mannella et al., 1994</a>). Compositionally, the boundary membrane is enriched for import and assembly machinery for the mitochondrial proteome (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vogel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wurm and Jakobs, 2006</a>). In contrast, cristae membranes house assembled electron transport chain protein complexes and ATP synthase, which function together to synthesize ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Specific combinations of electron transport chain complexes further assemble into large mega-Dalton supercomplexes in cristae in a manner dependent on the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and act to facilitate electron transport, and likely as diffusion traps to promote their sorting into cristae (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cruciat et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pfeiffer et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Acehan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wilkens et al., 2013</a>).

The MICOS complex is also embedded in the inner membrane with domains facing the intermembrane space that mediate the formation of heterologous structures localized to the inner boundary membrane (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>). It is comprised of six core subunits in yeast: Mic60, Mic10, Mic19, Mic27, Mic26, and Mic12, that, with the exception of Mic12, have mammalian homologs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Xie et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mun et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Darshi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Head et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alkhaja et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">An et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Weber et al., 2013</a>). Single MICOS subunit deletion causes a characteristic mitochondrial inner membrane morphological defect in cells, consisting of extended, stacked, lamellar inner membranes and a reduction of the number of cristae junctions, with a consequent lamellar mitochondrial shape defect. The common cellular phenotypes of single MICOS subunit deletions indicate that they perform a shared function. However, expression analysis indicates that Mic60 and Mic10 function uniquely as \u2018core components\u2019 that direct a hierarchal MICOS assembly as <i>MIC60</i> deletion causes Mic19 instability and <i>MIC10</i> deletion causes Mic27 instability (<a href=\"#bib17\">Harner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</a>). In addition, specific pairwise combinations of MICOS subunit deletions can produce either positive or negative genetic interactions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>), indicating that although MICOS subunits act cooperatively, they also perform non-redundant roles within mitochondria. For example, Mic60 plays a role in import independently of the MICOS complex (<a href=\"#bib52\">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</a>)."

Our data indicate that Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 assembles at cristae junctions in a respiratory complex- and cardiolipin-dependent manner. In contrast, Mic60 assembles and organizes independently of other MICOS subunits, cardiolipin, and the respiratory machinery, suggesting that Mic60 assemblies may intrinsically mark nascent cristae junctions. MICOS subcomplexes are bridged together by Mic19, which our data indicates controls the copy number and position of cristae junctions within mitochondria. Together, our findings demonstrate how the MICOS complex works with respiratory complexes and the mitochondria lipid environment to establish inner membrane architecture, organization and function."

Using this approach, we constructed \u2206MICOS\u2014a strain containing \u2018clean,\u2019 unmarked deletions of all six MICOS genes. In contrast to single MICOS subunit deletions, \u2206MICOS cells displayed a severe respiratory growth defect, as assessed by growth on the non-fermentable carbon source, glycerol (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right panel). Importantly, reintroduction of four of six MICOS genes at their native loci complemented the growth defect, validating the \u2206MICOS strain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The mitochondrial morphology defect of the \u2206MICOS strain, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy using the matrix-targeted fluorescent protein, mito-DsRed, was also more penetrant as compared to mitochondria in individual MICOS deletion cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Although the predominant lamellar shape phenotype present in single MICOS deletion mutants was observed (56% of \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells vs 21% of \u2206MICOS cells), a majority of \u2206MICOS cells also had bulbous mitochondrial structures with a beads on a string appearance, and hollow, large spherical structures that were sometimes continuous with the bulbous structures (11% of \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells vs 59% of \u2206MICOS cells) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

The mild overexpression of Mic60 as a consequence of two genomic copies did not interfere with the ability of pMic60-EGFP to localize to foci (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Purification of Mic60 from cross-linked extract from these cells using either \u03b1-FLAG or \u03b1-GFP antibodies specifically co-purified both tagged Mic60 versions by Western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To rule out the possibility that Mic60 foci represent insoluble aggregates, we solubilized mitochondria isolated from wild type and \u2206MICOS cells expressing Mic60-EGFP using the non-ionic detergent, Triton X-100, under relatively low ionic conditions and subjected extracts to ultracentrifugation. As in wild type cells, Mic60-EGFP expressed in \u2206MICOS cells remained soluble, indicating that Mic60 foci represent assembled structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These data indicate that Mic60 self-interacts in the absence of other MICOS members and suggest that Mic60 foci in \u2206MICOS may represent self-assemblies."

Expression of Mic10, Mic12, Mic26, or Mic27 had no apparent effect on Mic60 foci formation or frequency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast, expression of Mic19 caused Mic60 to become more distributed within mitochondria as compared to the matrix marker, with only 20% of \u2206MICOS + Mic19 cells possessing Mic60-EGFP foci as compared to 80% in cells expressing Mic60-EGFP alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F</a>). The unique dependence on Mic19 for Mic60 distribution in \u2206MICOS cells is consistent with the dependence of Mic19's stability on Mic60 in wild type cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Harner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</a>). To gain insight into the molecular basis of the effect of Mic19 on Mic60 distribution, we performed purifications using \u03b1-FLAG antibody and mass spectrometry analysis from cross-linked cell extracts of \u2206MICOS strains expressing Mic60-FLAG and untagged Mic19, or Mic19-FLAG and untagged Mic60, expressed from their endogenous loci. In each purification, we identified both Mic60 and Mic19 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), suggesting that Mic19 interacts directly with Mic60 independently of other MICOS subunits and that Mic19, in part, functions within MICOS to regulate the distribution of Mic60 along the inner membrane."

                                "text": "Because of the severe respiratory defect of the \u2206MICOS strain and the interrelationship between respiratory complexes and MICOS for generating mitochondrial inner membrane shape (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>), we tested whether respiratory complexes are required for Mic60 and Mic27 assembly formation. To block the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, we generated strains that lack mtDNA (rho<sup>0</sup>) and examined the distribution of the two MICOS subcomplexes as marked by either Mic60 foci (in \u2206MICOS + Mic60-EGFP cells) or Mic27 foci (in \u2206<i>mic60</i> + Mic27-mCherry cells). We observed that Mic60 foci in \u2206MICOS persisted in a majority of rho<sup>0</sup> cells (foci in 80% of rho<sup>+</sup> cells vs 64% of rho<sup>0</sup> cells; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). In contrast, although steady state expression level of Mic27 in \u2206<i>mic60</i> rho<sup>0</sup> cells was similar to in rho<sup>+</sup> cells, Mic27 assemblies were absent in rho<sup>0</sup> cells (foci in 86% of rho<sup>+</sup> cells vs 3% of rho<sup>0</sup> cells; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In \u2206<i>mic60</i> rho<sup>0</sup> cells, the absence of Mic27 foci corresponded to a loss of its interaction with Mic10 and Mic12 as assessed by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of Mic27 purifications (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1A</a>). The loss of Mic27 subcomplex interactions is due specifically to the combination of mtDNA loss and the absence of Mic60, as Mic27 co-purified with the entire MICOS complex in wild type rho<sup>0</sup> cells as assessed by mass spectrometry analysis of Mic27 purifications (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1B</a>). These data reveal that the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex is selectively dependent on the presence of mtDNA, suggesting a critical role of respiratory complexes in the assembly and/or stabilization of this MICOS subcomplex."

This observation indicates that individual respiratory complexes contribute to Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex formation/stability, but are not essential.

Thus, we considered the possibility that the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex marks cristae junctions. Previously, we observed that cells harboring individual MICOS deletions have a 3\u201310-fold reduction in the frequency of cristae junctions, but that junction architecture is not altered (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the relatively discrete nature and low copy number of Mic27 assemblies in \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells relative to the abundant assemblies in wild type cells is also consistent with its localization at cristae junctions. A direct assessment of whether Mic27-EGFP localizes to cristae junctions in \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells by thin section immuno-EM was not successful due to technical challenges posed by the low copy number of cristae junctions. As an alternative, we utilized fluorescent protein fusions of respiratory complex constituents that selectively localize to cristae (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wurm and Jakobs, 2006</a>). In wild type cells, functional markers for Complex III (Qcr2-mCherry) and ATP synthase (Atp2-mCherry) were relatively uniformly distributed as compared to the matrix marker, consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wurm and Jakobs, 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A\u20133B</a>). In contrast, in \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells, both Qcr2-mCherry and Atp2-mCherry possessed a non-uniform distribution and concentrated in discrete subregions of mitochondria as compared to the matrix marker (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). In addition, Atp2-EGFP fluorescence signal marked edges of Qcr2-mCherry-labeled subregions of \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3D\u20133E</a>). EM analysis of ATP synthase localization in different cell types indicates that it selectively localizes in multimeric ribbons to the curved edges of cristae (<a href=\"#bib49\">Strauss et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Acehan et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the localization patterns of Atp2 in subregions marked by Qcr2 strongly suggests that these are lamellar, stacked cristae as visualized by EM in \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells."

In this context, the paralogous Mic27 and Mic26 contain an Apolipoprotein O-like lipid-binding domain, and the mammalian homolog, MIC27/APOOL, has been shown to specifically bind to cardiolipin in vitro (<a href=\"#bib53\">Weber et al., 2013</a>). In addition, members of the MICOS complex have a strong negative genetic interaction with members of the cardiolipin synthesis pathway, further suggesting that MICOS and cardiolipin act together to maintain mitochondrial function (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>). We therefore asked whether cardiolipin affected the assembly/stability of the Mic27 subcomplex in mitochondria. We examined both the localization of Mic27 and mitochondrial morphology in wild type cells and cells lacking the mitochondrial cardiolipin synthesis enzyme, Crd1. Deletion of <i>CRD1</i> led to minor mitochondrial morphology and respiratory growth defects in cells, consistent with published observations (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jiang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D,E</a>). In \u2206<i>crd1</i> cells, the non-uniform localization pattern of Mic27 was similar to wild type cells and consistently, mass spectrometry analysis of purifications of Mic27 from \u2206<i>crd1</i> cell extracts indicated that the MICOS complex was intact (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>, and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). In contrast, we found that in \u2206<i>mic60</i> \u2206<i>crd1</i> cells, Mic27-EGFP foci were largely absent and Mic27 stability was reduced as compared to levels in wild type, \u2206<i>mic60</i>, or \u2206<i>crd1</i> cells (foci in 87% of \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells vs 2% of \u2206<i>mic60</i> \u2206<i>crd1</i> cells; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The requirement of cardiolipin for Mic27 stability and Mic27 assemblies was specific, as Mic60 foci formation was not significantly affected in \u2206MICOS \u2206<i>crd1</i> cells as compared to \u2206MICOS cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Consistent with loss of Mic27 assemblies, purification and mass spectrometry analysis of Mic27 from cross-linked \u2206<i>mic60</i> \u2206<i>crd1</i> cell extracts indicates a loss of interaction of Mic27 with the MICOS complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Together, these data indicate that the association of Mic27 to the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex is dependent on cardiolipin and suggest that cardiolipin is required for its localization at cristae junctions."

Together, these data indicate that in cells the absence of both Mic60 and cardiolipin partially phenocopies deletion of the entire MICOS complex and suggest that cardiolipin, in addition to its role in the assembly of respiratory chain supercomplexes, acts to promote the assembly of Mic27 into the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex and its localization to cristae junctions. Importantly, the genetic interaction between <i>CRD1</i> and <i>MIC10</i> differs from that of <i>CRD1</i> and <i>MIC27</i>, suggesting that there are complex interactions both within and between each MICOS subcomplex and their mitochondrial environment (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

Mitochondrial respiratory complexes and supercomplexes remained largely intact in both \u2206<i>mic60</i> and \u2206MICOS mitochondria as assessed by Blue Native PAGE (BN-PAGE) analysis relative to mitochondria isolated from wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Likewise, both ATP synthase dimerization and activity were unaffected in either single MICOS deletions or \u2206MICOS as assessed by an in gel activity assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). However, despite the presence of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, we detected deficiencies in cytochrome-<i>c</i> oxidase (Complex IV) activity specifically in \u2206MICOS and not in \u2206<i>mic60</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Using two-dimensional gel analysis, we determined that the composition of respiratory complexes in \u2206<i>mic60</i> and \u2206MICOS cells was indistinguishable from wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). These data indicate that in the absence of the MICOS complex, respiratory complexes can assemble, but do not function optimally. It is possible that in the absence of the MICOS complex, the respiratory defect results from a severe decrease in cristae junctions and consequent disorganization of the inner membrane structure. Alternatively, but not exclusively, MICOS could play a more direct role in the organization of respiratory complexes in the inner membrane."

                                "text": "To further test this idea, we examined the relationship between respiratory complexes and the mitochondrial morphology defect in \u2206MICOS cells. Specifically, we asked whether mitochondrial morphology was altered in \u2206MICOS rho<sup>0</sup> cells, which lack mitochondrial respiratory complexes. Strikingly, \u2206MICOS rho<sup>0</sup> cells exhibited relatively normal, tubular mitochondrial morphology as assessed by fluorescence microscopy of matrix-targeted dsRed as compared to \u2206MICOS rho<sup>+</sup> cells (10% rho<sup>+</sup> cells vs 95% rho<sup>0</sup> cells exhibited tubular mitochondrial morphology; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,G</a>). As expected, by electron microscopy, the inner membrane of \u2206MICOS rho<sup>0</sup> cells lacked detectable cristae and were frequently septated, suggesting that mitochondrial inner membrane fusion is compromised likely as a secondary consequence of reduced respiration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sauvanet et al., 2012</a>). Thus, in the absence of the MICOS complex, expression of respiratory complexes causes inner membrane disorganization, and consequently, severe and diverse abnormal mitochondrial morphologies. Consistently, loss of ATP synthase was previously shown to suppress the predominant lamellar mitochondrial morphology defect of \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we asked whether deletion of individual respiratory complexes alleviated the \u2206MICOS mitochondria morphological defect by deleting genes for essential assembly factors of Complex III (\u2206<i>cbs1</i>), Complex IV (\u2206<i>mss51</i>), and ATP synthase (\u2206<i>atp10</i>) from \u2206MICOS. As in \u2206<i>mic60</i> cells, deletion of ATP synthase assembly selectively suppressed the abnormal mitochondrial lamellar phenotype of \u2206MICOS, but the bulbous or spherical morphologies were still present in the cell population. Only 25% of \u2206MICOS \u2206<i>atp10</i> cells had normal tubular morphology, compared to 10% in \u2206MICOS alone, suggesting distinct morphological phenotypes present in \u2206MICOS are caused by separate factors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,G</a>). Consistent with this, deletion of either Complex III or IV assembly factors more significantly alleviated all types of \u2206MICOS morphological defects, as \u223c75% of \u2206MICOS \u2206<i>cbs1</i> or \u2206MICOS \u2206<i>mss51</i> cells had normal tubular mitochondrial morphology (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,G</a>). These observations, together with the reduced Complex IV activity in \u2206MICOS cells, suggest that assembled respiratory Complex III and IV are not properly organized and/or positioned in \u2206MICOS, leading to morphological and respiratory growth defects."

Mic60 assembles independently of the MICOS complex and its interactions with other MICOS members are significantly reduced in \u2206<i>mic19</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B, 7A</a>). Consistent with these data, we observed that Mic60 localizes to focal assemblies in \u2206<i>mic19</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We tested the relationship between Mic60 and Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 assemblies in \u2206<i>mic19</i> cells expressing Mic60-EGFP and Mic27-mCherry. We found that the focal localization of Mic60 and Mic27 overlapped, suggesting Mic60 assemblies also mark cristae junctions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, see arrows). Consistently, Mic60 assemblies in \u2206<i>mic19</i> cells localized adjacent to discrete mitochondrial subregions labeled by the cristae markers Qcr2 and Atp2, further supporting their localization to cristae junctions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Thus, while it is possible that the co-localization of Mic60 with Mic27 in \u2206<i>mic19</i> cells is due to direct interactions between the Mic60 and Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplexes, the behavior of Mic60 assemblies in \u2206<i>mic19</i> cells is consistent with that of Mic60 assemblies in \u2206MICOS cells. These observations suggest that Mic60 structures may independently mark cristae junctions in cells. Their persistence in \u2206MICOS rho<sup>0</sup> cells, which lack detectable cristae further suggests that Mic60 functions upstream of the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex to position nascent sites of cristae junction formation within mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A, 6F</a>). In the context of our data supporting a role of Mic19 as a MICOS subcomplex regulator and connector, we propose that Mic19 coordinately regulates the assembly of MICOS to dictate the copy number and distribution of cristae in the inner membrane."

The second MICOS subcomplex consists of a Mic60 multimer, which assembles in a manner independent of cardiolipin, respiratory complexes, and other MICOS proteins. Although each subcomplex assembles independently, the cardiolipin- and respiratory complex-independent nature of Mic60 assemblies suggest that there is a hierarchical nature to MICOS assembly, where Mic60 functions upstream of the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex in MICOS assembly. In this context, we observed Mic60 assemblies in cells without mtDNA, which lack detectable cristae by electron microscopic analysis.

Mitochondrial internal determinants may also contribute to the assembly and position of Mic60, such as the mtDNA-independent replisome, which could function to coordinate cristae biogenesis with nucleoid placement (<a href=\"#bib32\">Meeusen and Nunnari, 2003</a>). Alternatively, but not exclusively, it is possible that Mic60 assembles at mitochondrial lipid sub-domains positioned, for example, by contacts between mitochondria and the ER (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kornmann et al., 2009</a>)."

Cardiolipin is also required for the assembly and activity of respiratory complexes and for the formation of respiratory supercomplexes, which are processes that do not depend on MICOS. Thus, our observations suggest that Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 may instead directly sense cardiolipin-rich subdomains of mitochondria to coordinate the non-redundant actions of MICOS and cardiolipin in the respiratory complex-dependent formation of cristae junctions. Consistent with this, Mic26 and Mic27 both share a conserved Apolipoprotein O-like domain, which in other contexts bind to lipids. We could not detect a role for Mic26 in MICOS subcomplex assembly, although its domain architecture suggests it may also function to coordinate MICOS with the mitochondrial lipid environment. In addition, although we failed to generate a functional Mic10 fluorescent protein to directly examine its localization and behavior, the observation that Mic10 is required for Mic27 stability suggests that it plays a central role in directing the formation and function of the Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 subcomplex."

The reciprocal is not true as we find that MICOS is not required for respiratory supercomplex assembly. However, in the absence of MICOS, the activity of cytochrome-<i>c</i> oxidase Complex IV is somewhat reduced and, more importantly, cells lacking MICOS exhibit a severe respiratory defect. One explanation for this severe defect is that MICOS's role in the regulation of cristae copy number is important for producing an optimal distance within cristae between the electron transporting Complex III/IV supercomplexes, localized at lamellar regions, and ATP synthase oligomers localized to the curved edges for efficient oxidative phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rieger et al., 2014</a>). Our data also implicate Complex III and IV directly in the nucleation of cristae and in the process of cristae biogenesis. This is supported by the requirement of Complex III and IV for the generation of aberrant mitochondrial morphology in the absence of MICOS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The basis for this observation may lie in the ability of Complex III and IV to form large cardiolipin-dependent supercomplexes, which could act as diffusion traps for the cristae proteome and lipidome (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wilkens et al., 2013</a>). Recent work also implicates a role for the inner membrane fusion dynamin, OPA1, in the regulation of mitochondrial inner membrane shape and respiratory supercomplex assembly (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cogliati et al., 2013</a>). Thus, future work will be required to understand the mechanistic relationships between MICOS and respiratory complexes and OPA1 in the process of inner membrane organization."

A typical wild type mitochondrion possesses many cristae positioned and distributed along the mitochondrial boundary inner membrane. We find that the only soluble MICOS protein, Mic19 functions as the key component directing the inner membrane distribution of each MICOS subcomplex. We propose that through this distributive action and its role as a connector/adaptor, Mic19 regulates the copy number of the MICOS complex and, consequently, the copy number and position of cristae junctions. In this context, it is interesting to note that Mic19 has two mammalian homologs (MIC19 and MIC25), with conserved coiled-coil-helix motifs, consistent with a role as a key regulatory component of MICOS and suggesting a structural basis for its role as a connector."

Currently, protein localization assessments are indirect (near Ox Phos complex proteins in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) and of low resolution. An important conclusion is that the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 complex localizes to cristae junctions independent of Mic60. This is based on the correlated locations of Mic27 and respiratory complexes presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4D and E</a>. At least a quantification (which is admittedly a challenge on its own) of the proximity of Mic27 to Qcr2 and Atp2 and addressing whether they are more adjacent to each other than to some other mitochondrial substructure (nucleoids?) is needed to support this conclusion. This would assure that not everything is close together within mitochondria visualized at this low resolution. However, immune-Ems would be the best solution."

Could the Mic60 foci in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> be misfolded aggregates? Perhaps expression of Mic19 stabilizes Mic60 allowing it to fold more normally. Immuno-EM may allow the authors to support the claim that Mic60 labels discrete structures (cristae junctions?) rather than forming nonspecific aggregates. Or perhaps blue native gels would support the contention that Mic60 forms discrete substructures. It would be important to back up or substantiate the authors\u2019 conclusion at the end of the subsection headed \u201cMic10, Mic12, and Mic27 form a second independent MICOS organizing center\u201d that Mic60 \u201chas an intrinsic self-organizational capacity\u201d above and beyond self-aggregation. Self-aggregation may also explain why Mic60 foci form in Rho0 cells. On the other hand, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> shows that Mic60 forms focal assemblies in Mic19 null cells that overlap with Mic27. This supports the authors\u2019 idea that Mic60 is localized to actual substructures but in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> (relative to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) location of Mic60 may be influenced by other MICOS proteins and prevent aggregation."

However, loss of cardiolipin leads to disassembly of respiratory chain super complexes, which have been linked to cristae morphogenesis. It remains unclear how the authors distinguish between a direct effect of cardiolipin on Mic27 from that caused by an assembly defect of respiratory chain super complexes (even more as they observe that impaired assembly of respiratory complexes affects MICOS sub complexes)."

The authors should at least perform EM analysis to examine whether deletions of CBS1 or MSS51 restore cristae in the absence of Mic60 or MICOS."

Data supporting this conclusion include the dependence of Mic27 foci formation on the presence of cristae as well as the adjacent localization of Mic27 foci to cristae-localized respiratory complex proteins <i>\u2206mic60</i> cells. We agree that more equivocal support would include immuno-EM data demonstrating more directly the localization of Mic27 to cristae junctions. However, immuno-EM analysis of Mic27 in <i>\u2206mic60</i> cells, as mentioned in the manuscript, proved too technically challenging because of the low abundance of both cristae junctions and Mic27 foci in <i>\u2206mic60</i> cells and the difficulty associated with visualizing cristae junctions in thin section. However, in order to determine if this problem was specific to <i>\u2206mic60</i> cells, we performed immuno-labeling of Mic60 in both <i>\u2206mic19</i> cells and \u2206MICOS cells. We obtained images of gold particle clusters specific for Mic60 at the edges of mitochondria (as observed for Mic27 immuno-gold labeling), which likely correspond to the focal appearance we observe by fluorescence. However as seen previously for Mic27, we could not determine whether these were spatially linked to cristae junctions because of the morphology of the mitochondrial membranes in these thin sections."

We think these images convincingly demonstrate the localization of both Mic27 and Mic60 foci immediately adjacent to submitochondrial-concentrated regions of Qcr2 and Atp2. Thus, to further test this, we developed an unbiased quantitative analysis method of these higher resolution images, which indicates that the localization pattern of Mic27 foci adjacent to Qcr2-labled cristae is non-random (see new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D-4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2013supplement 5</a>)."

Specifically, in \u2206MICOS cells only aberrant mitochondrial morphology is restored upon loss of respiratory complexes (rho0), not cristae structure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Indeed, restoration of morphology correlates with loss of cristae in rho0 cells, which indicates that the aberrant cristae, observed by light imaging of Qcr2, causes mitochondrial morphological defects in \u2206MICOS, a finding we previously published for single MICOS subunit deletion cells (Hoppins et al. JCB 2011). Thus, while deletion of CBS1 and MSS51 partially restore tubular morphology in \u2206MICOS cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and 6G</a>), this is not mediated through restoration of cristae morphology."
