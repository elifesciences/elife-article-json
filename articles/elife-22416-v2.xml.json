Here, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1 (OTUD2) as a novel interactor of TRAF6 in human cells. YOD1 binds to the C-terminal TRAF homology domain of TRAF6 that also serves as the interaction surface for the adaptor p62/Sequestosome-1, which is required for IL-1 signaling to NF-\u03baB. We show that YOD1 competes with p62 for TRAF6 association and abolishes the sequestration of TRAF6 to cytosolic p62 aggregates by a non-catalytic mechanism. YOD1 associates with TRAF6 in unstimulated cells but is released upon IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, thereby facilitating TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination as well as NEMO/IKK\u03b3 substrate ubiquitination. Further, IL-1 triggered IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling and induction of target genes is decreased by YOD1 overexpression and augmented after YOD1 depletion. Hence, our data define that YOD1 antagonizes TRAF6/p62-dependent IL-1 signaling to NF-\u03baB."

Here, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1 (OTUD2) as a novel interactor of TRAF6 in human cells. YOD1 binds to the C-terminal TRAF homology domain of TRAF6 that also serves as the interaction surface for the adaptor p62/Sequestosome-1, which is required for IL-1 signaling to NF-\u03baB. We show that YOD1 competes with p62 for TRAF6 association and abolishes the sequestration of TRAF6 to cytosolic p62 aggregates by a non-catalytic mechanism. YOD1 associates with TRAF6 in unstimulated cells but is released upon IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, thereby facilitating TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination as well as NEMO/IKK\u03b3 substrate ubiquitination. Further, IL-1 triggered IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling and induction of target genes is decreased by YOD1 overexpression and augmented after YOD1 depletion. Hence, our data define that YOD1 antagonizes TRAF6/p62-dependent IL-1 signaling to NF-\u03baB."

The N-terminal RING and Zinc Finger1 (Z1) domain confers ubiquitin ligase activity. In response to IL-1 stimulation, TRAF6 in conjunction with the E2 enzyme UBC13/UEV1A catalyzes the attachment of lysine (K)63-linked ubiquitin chains to substrate proteins, including TRAF6 itself, IRAK1, TAK1 and the non-catalytic IKK complex component NEMO/IKK\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deng et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Conze et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yamazaki et al., 2009</a>).

Since TRAF6 overexpression alone is sufficient to strongly activate NF-\u03baB (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 1996</a>), its activity needs to be tightly controlled by positive and negative regulators."

However, p62 also recruits the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) CYLD (Cylindromatosis) that acts as negative regulator of NF-\u03baB signaling (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wooten et al., 2008</a>).

Besides CYLD, the ubiquitin editing enzyme A20 counterbalances TRAF6 activity.

Originally, the yeast homolog OTU1 was shown to act as a cofactor of the hexameric AAA-ATPase Cdc48/p97 for protein processing (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006</a>). In mammalian cells, YOD1 facilitates protein quality control by Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway (<a href=\"#bib6\">Claessen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ernst et al., 2009</a>). We find that YOD1 directly associates with TRAF6 and competes with p62 for TRAF6 binding and activation. YOD1 is released from TRAF6 upon IL-1 stimulation and YOD1 depletion enhances canonical NF-\u03baB activation. These results define YOD1 as novel negative regulator of TRAF6/p62-triggered IL-1 signaling."

                                "text": "To identify regulators of TRAF6, we searched for interaction partners by yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H). We discovered a novel interaction of YOD1 with full length TRAF6, but not with a fragment comprising the catalytic RING-Zinc Finger1 (Z1) domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Originally, mammalian YOD1 and its yeast homolog OTU1 were identified as co-factor of the AAA-ATPase p97/Cdc48 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ernst et al., 2009</a>), which was also confirmed in the Y2H (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Besides the binding to YOD1, TRAF6 self-associated and bound to the E2 enzyme UBC13 and the ubiquitin editing enzyme A20, but not to p97 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To obtain data on the selectivity of YOD1/TRAF6 interaction, we checked binding of YOD1 to a panel of E3 ligases as well as other proteins involved in regulatory ubiquitination by Y2H (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Despite some weak interaction with cIAP2 and SHARPIN, within this panel YOD1 was quite selectively binding to p97 and TRAF6. Protein expression was determined by Western Blotting and functionality of some proteins in yeast was confirmed by verifying known interactions of selected constructs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D and E</a>). Of note, even though expression of some E3 ligases was barely detectable, the interaction with known partners (e.g. HOIP with OTULIN or cIAP1/2 with UBC13) was readily detectable in the growth assay. To confirm that TRAF6 and YOD1 are directly associating and to narrow down the YOD1 binding site on TRAF6, we expressed and purified recombinant YOD1 and TRAF6 proteins and performed pull-down (PD) experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Clearly, YOD1 was binding to the C-terminal MATH (346 -504) but not to the N-terminal RING-Z1 (50\u2013159) domain of TRAF6. In addition, we confirmed binding of recombinant YOD1 to p97 by GST-PD (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In a triple PD experiment we neither found that YOD1-p97 association was prevented by TRAF6 nor that p97 did influence interaction of YOD1 to the TRAF6 MATH domain, revealing that both proteins can bind to YOD1 independently (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

Co-immunoprecipitations (IP) using anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies confirmed the interaction of TRAF6 and YOD1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>). Congruent with the Y2H and PD results, YOD1 bound to the C-terminal MATH domain, but not to the N-terminal RING-Z1-Z4 region of TRAF6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). On the side of YOD1, the N-terminal UBX domain was essential to mediate TRAF6 interaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, scheme <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Sequence comparison indicated the existence of a putative TRAF6 interaction motif (TIM) for MATH interactors within the UBX domain (PXEXXAr/Ac) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ye et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). However, neither exchange of the conserved glutamic acid to alanine (YOD1 E96A) nor even more profound mutations of the putative TRAF6 binding motif abolished YOD1 association (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), indicating that binding of TRAF6 MATH to YOD1 UBX domain is not mediated through a typical TIM. To assess the selectivity of YOD1/TRAF6 interaction, we compared association of YOD1 to TRAF2 and TRAF6 in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>).

Indeed, in all cell lines and primary HUVEC YOD1 was specifically co-precipitating with endogenous TRAF6, as validated by either TRAF6 or YOD1 IP. Further, specificity of TRAF6/YOD1 interaction was confirmed by the decreased co-precipitation of YOD1 in TRAF6 knock-down HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). We compared the expression levels of TRAF6 and YOD1 in different cell lines (HeLa, HEK293, U2OS and PC3 cells) and tested, if there was a correlation between expression and association (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). TRAF6/YOD1 binding was visible in all cells and there was a tendency that more TRAF6/YOD1 association was observed in cells that expressed more TRAF6 (U2OS and HEK293). Since YOD1 has been described as a cellular co-factor of p97, we checked for YOD1/TRAF6 interaction in p97 knock-down HEK293 cells and found that binding of YOD1 to TRAF6 was not significantly altered upon p97 depletion (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). Thus, cellular and in vitro binding studies identify the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1 as a direct interaction partner of the E3 ligase TRAF6."

To confirm co-localization, we plotted fluorescence intensities (FI) of RFP-TRAF6 and GFP-YOD1 through spot containing sections and show that the peaks of highest RFP and GFP FI overlap (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

                                "text": "The MATH domain of TRAF6 serves as interaction and oligomerization platform and thus it is critically involved in regulating TRAF6 functions in NF-\u03baB signaling (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ye et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Walsh et al., 2015</a>). By directly comparing the binding of YOD1 and p62 to TRAF6 in HEK293 cells we could confirm that both proteins are associating with the C-terminal MATH domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Therefore, we investigated whether YOD1 and p62 are binding simultaneously to TRAF6 and potentially forming a tripartite complex or if binding of the two MATH domain interactors is mutually exclusive and possibly even competitive. Indeed, co-IP experiments using MYC-TRAF6 together with Crimson-p62 and GFP-YOD1 revealed that YOD1 was able to inhibit the association of TRAF6 and p62, while p62 did not alter the binding of YOD1 to TRAF6 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and E</a>). Inhibition of p62/TRAF6 binding was independent of YOD1 catalytic activity, suggesting that YOD1 and p62 are competing for an association with TRAF6 independent of YOD1 DUB activity. Since p62/TRAF6 as well as YOD1/TRAF6 form cytosolic aggregates, we carefully analyzed their localization by confocal microscopy when all three proteins (RFP-TRAF6, Crimson-p62 and GFP-YOD1) were co-expressed in U2OS and HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). Even though all three proteins were found in cytoplasmic speckles, the merged images especially at a higher magnification indicated that while YOD1 and TRAF6 were co-localizing within clusters as seen in the absence of Crimson-p62 (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), p62 in contrast was in the vicinity, but largely excluded from YOD1/TRAF6 aggregates. The same distribution was seen when catalytically inactive YOD1 C160S was expressed in U2OS cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In line, the plotted FI showed co-localization of RFP-TRAF6 and GFP-YOD1 but not Crimson-p62 peaks in all analyses. Also, automated image analysis of FI in a larger number of cells indicates a stronger enrichment of RFP-TRAF6 signal in GFP-YOD1 spots compared to Crimson-p62 spots and no co-localization beyond background of Crimson-p62 in RFP-TRAF6 or GFP-YOD1 clusters (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Thus, co-IP and co-localization studies suggest that YOD1, p62 and TRAF6 are not found in a trimeric complex, but that YOD1 and p62 compete for TRAF6 association and that YOD1 can interfere with the recruitment of TRAF6 to p62 sequestosomes by a non-catalytic mechanism."

By lentiviral transduction we generated HeLa cells that inducibly overexpress YOD1 WT or YOD1 C160S (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We used a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible expression system and generated a HeLa cell population that stably expresses the transcriptional repressor tTR-KRAB together with dsRed (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wiznerowicz and Trono, 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Under DOX/tTR-KRAB control, we then co-expressed YOD1 and GFP using the co-translational processing site T2A. Sorting by FACS yielded homogenous populations of GFP expressing cells after DOX treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), correlating with YOD1 overexpression in the infected cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We consistently found that expression of catalytically inactive YOD1 C160S was substantially lower than YOD1 WT, potentially indicating toxic effects of high overexpression of the mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). To address if overexpression of YOD1 impacts on NF-\u03baB activation, we measured by quantitative (q)RT-PCR the expression of the well-defined NF-\u03baB target genes <i>NFKBIA/I\u03baB\u03b1</i> , <i>TNFAIP3/A20</i> and <i>TNFA</i> in response to IL-1\u03b2 in the absence or presence of overexpressed YOD1 (minus or plus DOX, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). While DOX treatment alone did not significantly alter expression of these genes in HeLa parental cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), expression of YOD1 WT or C160S caused a significant decline in NF-\u03baB target gene induction after IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, indicating that YOD1 can antagonize IL-1R triggered NF-\u03baB signaling independent of its catalytic activity."

After lentiviral transduction of HeLa cells, DOX treatment led to strong and homogenous GFP expression, which correlated with a decrease in YOD1 protein expression upon increasing DOX concentrations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> \u2013 <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Again, we analyzed expression of NF-\u03baB target genes upon IL-1\u03b2 stimulation in YOD1 expressing (minus DOX) or depleted (plus DOX) HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). In line with a negative regulatory function of YOD1 for IL-1\u03b2 signaling to NF-\u03baB, reduction of YOD1 resulted in enhanced NF-\u03baB target gene expression, which was especially evident at early stimulation time points. Taken together, overexpression and knock-down experiments suggest that YOD1 counteracts a rapid induction of NF-\u03baB target genes in response to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation."

For this, exon 4 of the YOD1 gene, which encodes almost the entire open reading frame, was deleted by transfection of flanking single guide RNAs together with Cas9 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). After clonal selection loss of YOD1 was analyzed by PCR of genomic DNA and Western Blotting (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The approach yielded two independent HeLa cell clones (#6 and #33) that carry the expected genomic deletion as verified by sequencing. Despite a faint residual PCR fragment at the size of YOD1 WT, no WT DNA could be detected by sequencing and the Western Blot demonstrates loss of YOD1 protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, single cell clones from HeLa cells independent of the YOD1 status displayed a great heterogeneity with respect to cell proliferation, gene induction, NF-\u03baB signaling etc. Therefore, we directly compared the effects within the individual YOD1 KO clones after lentiviral reconstitution, because due to the high transduction efficiency clonal selection was not required. Cells were sorted by FACS to obtain homogenous population of GFP positive cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and expression of YOD1 was verified by Western Blot (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). As observed earlier (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), expression of YOD1 C160S was much weaker and therefore we focused the functional analyses on YOD1 WT reconstituted cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Co-IP revealed binding of reconstituted YOD1 to TRAF6 in unstimulated cells and the interaction was reduced after IL-1\u03b2 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). On the level of NF-\u03baB target gene expression we could verify the negative regulatory influence of YOD1 on gene induction as previously seen upon YOD1 overexpression or knock-down in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Next, we examined direct effects on canonical NF-\u03baB signaling in YOD1 KO clones in the absence (mock) or the presence of YOD1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). As expected for a putative negative regulator that controls TRAF6-dependent upstream signaling, activation of NF-\u03baB DNA binding in response to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation was reduced in YOD1 expressing HeLa cells. In line, phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 was reduced in YOD1 expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, reconstitution of two independent KO cell clones provided clear evidence that YOD1 counteracts NF-\u03baB signaling upon IL-1\u03b2 stimulation."

All three siRNAs yielded an efficient knock-down of their respective target on protein level (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Whereas knock-down of TRAF6 or p62 severely impaired IL-1\u03b2 triggered NF-\u03baB activation as evident by EMSA, depletion of YOD1 enhanced NF-\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Congruently, induction of NF-\u03baB target genes <i>NFKBIA/I\u03baB\u03b1</i> and <i>TNFAIP3/A20</i> was decreased by TRAF6 or p62 knock-down and increased by YOD1 knock-down (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Downregulation of TRAF6 or p62 prevented I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and YOD1 depletion enhanced I\u03baB\u03b1 removal upon IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, demonstrating that all proteins affect NF-\u03baB signaling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Since TRAF6 acts upstream of IKK on the route to NF-\u03baB, we verified that YOD1 also controls IKK activation by showing that YOD1 reduction coincides with increased IKK T-loop phosphorylation after IL-1\u03b2 treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Of note, while IKK/NF-\u03baB activation was significantly enhanced in the absence of YOD1, we found no effect of YOD1 knock-down on the activation of the MAPKs JNK, p38 and ERK (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). TRAF6 is involved in NF-\u03baB activation in response to IL-1R stimulation, but dispensable for TNFR triggered NF-\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lomaga et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 1996</a>).

While both stimuli induced NF-\u03baB activation as evident by I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB DNA binding, YOD1 depletion led to strongly augmented NF-\u03baB signaling and activation after IL-1R engagement, while TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB signaling was unaffected by altered YOD1 amounts."

Thus, to determine a putative role of YOD1 in other TRAF6/p62-dependent pathways, we knocked-down TRAF6, p62 or YOD1 in CD40 expressing 293 or PC3 cells prior to stimulation with CD40-L or RANKL, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). As expected, TRAF6 knock-down led to diminished I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB activation after CD40 or RANK stimulation. However, despite an efficient downregulation, p62 knock-down did not significantly affect NF-\u03baB activation in response to both stimuli. Indeed, the previous studies already indicated that the role of p62 for CD40 and RANK signaling is relying on the cell type and the timing of stimulation (see Discussion) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dur\u00e1n et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Seibold and Ehrenschwender, 2015</a>). In contrast to its negative regulatory role for IL-1 signaling, YOD1 downregulation impaired I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB activation upon CD40 or RANK stimulation in these cellular systems. Thus, the results indicate that YOD1 is not counteracting NF-\u03baB signaling in general, but its negative function is restricted to the TRAF6/p62-dependent IL-1 pathway. In fact, in the case of CD40 and RANK signaling\u00a0YOD1 even promotes NF-\u03baB activation."

TRAF6 is an E3 ligase which in conjunction with the E2 enzyme UBC13/UEV1A transfers K63-linked ubiquitin chains onto its substrates (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deng et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yin et al., 2009</a>). Also TRAF6 itself is ubiquitinated by an autocatalytic mechanism (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lamothe et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). By MYC-TRAF6 and GFP-YOD1 overexpression in HEK293 cells, we analyzed if YOD1 as deubiquitinating enzyme was able to remove ubiquitin chains conjugated to TRAF6 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Under denaturing conditions (1% SDS) and after MYC-IP, TRAF6 ubiquitination is readily detectable and YOD1 expression did not interfere with TRAF6 poly-ubiquitination, which is in line with its previously reported inability to cleave K63-linked ubiquitin chains (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mevissen et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Binding of p62 has been shown to enhance TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wooten et al., 2005</a>) and as expected, TRAF6 ubiquitination was strongly increased in the presence of p62 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Noticeably, co-expression of YOD1 abrogated this enhancement. Also, catalytically inactive YOD1 C160S impaired the boost of TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination by p62, even though the inhibition was not quite as severe as with YOD1 WT. To validate that YOD1 does not directly cleave off ubiquitin chains from TRAF6, we incubated the p62-boosted TRAF6 ubiquitination with a panel of purified DUBs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As expected, the non-selective DUB USP2 eradicated all TRAF6 ubiquitin modifications. The severe reduction of K63-linked and overall ubiquitination by the K63-specific DUB AMSH indicates predominant K63 ubiquitination of TRAF6. In contrast, neither recombinant YOD1 (K11, K27, K29 and K33 selectivity) nor Cezanne (K11 selectivity) were cleaving TRAF6 ubiquitin chains. Therefore, the data show that p62-induced attachment of K63-linked ubiquitin chains to TRAF6 is counterbalanced by YOD1 primarily by a non-catalytic mechanism that involves competition with p62 for TRAF6 association (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>)."

                                "text": "To demonstrate that YOD1 also counteracts TRAF6 E3 ligase activity upon IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, we first determined inducible TRAF6 ubiquitination in YOD1 KO cells upon reintroduction of YOD1. TRAF6 was ubiquitinated upon IL-1\u03b2 treatment in mock transduced YOD1 KO HeLa cell clones, but TRAF6 ubiquitination was diminished upon re-expression of YOD1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In fact, IL-1-induced TRAF6 ubiquitination correlates with a decreased binding of YOD1 to TRAF6 after IL-1 stimulation (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), and we asked, whether reduced binding is also visible at the level of endogenous proteins in HeLa cells and primary HUVEC cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C and D</a>). As noted earlier, YOD1 was co-precipitating with TRAF6 in unstimulated cells and the interaction was lost within the first 15\u201320 min of IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, revealing that TRAF6 is released from YOD1. To test whether endogenous p62 and YOD1 exert opposing functions in the regulation of TRAF6 ubiquitination in response to IL-1\u03b2, we knocked-down both proteins by siRNA and determined TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Whereas p62 depletion completely abolished stimulus-dependent TRAF6 ubiquitination, down-regulation of YOD1 had an opposite effect, leading to increased ubiquitination after IL-1\u03b2 treatment. Again, to obtain data on the type of ubiquitin chains that TRAF6 is decorated with, we precipitated TRAF6 from IL-1\u03b2 stimulated HeLa cells and incubated it with a panel of DUBs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). As already seen with TRAF6 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the promiscuous DUB USP2 and the K63 selective DUBs AMSH or, to a minor extent, TRABID cleaved TRAF6-attached ubiquitin chains. However, none of the other DUBs including YOD1 was able to remove TRAF6 ubiquitin chains, strongly suggesting that TRAF6 is primarily modified with K63-linked ubiquitin chains and that YOD1 is counteracting TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination by a non-catalytic mechanism. Ubiquitination of the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO is an important step in stimulus-dependent IKK activation and it was shown that NEMO ubiquitination induced by TRAF6 expression or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation requires p62 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zotti et al., 2014</a>). Also in HeLa cells ubiquitination of NEMO after IL-1\u03b2 treatment was abolished in TRAF6 or p62 knock-down cells and YOD1 depletion had the opposite effect by enhancing stimulus-dependent NEMO ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Thus, YOD1 counteracts IL-1 signaling to NF-\u03baB by functioning as a negative regulator of TRAF6/p62-mediated ubiquitination events."

Binding of the adapter p62/SQSTM1 enhances TRAF6 E3 ligase activity to promote NF-\u03baB signaling upon IL-1 stimulation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sanz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wooten et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dur\u00e1n et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Seibold and Ehrenschwender, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 1996</a>) Here, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1 as a new regulator of TRAF6/p62-dependent IL-1R signaling to NF-\u03baB. YOD1 is an OTU domain DUB that can hydrolyze K11, K27, K29 and K33 ubiquitin linkages (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mevissen et al., 2013</a>). Structure-function analyses showed a high preference of the YOD1 OTU for K11- and K33-linked ubiquitin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Flierman et al., 2016</a>) and as expected, we do not detect cleavage of K63-linked ubiquitin chains generated by TRAF6. A number of findings suggest that YOD1 controls TRAF6/p62-dependent IL-1 signaling predominantly by a non-catalytic mechanism: YOD1 as well as catalytically inactive YOD1 (i) compete with p62 for TRAF6 binding, (ii) abolish the formation of cellular p62/TRAF6 aggregates, (iii) prevent enhancement of TRAF6 ubiquitination by p62 and (iv) inhibit IL-1-induced NF-\u03baB activation upon overexpression. Since we see a slightly stronger reduction of p62-enhanced TRAF6 ubiquitination using YOD1 WT compared to catalytically inactive YOD1 C160S, it remains possible that YOD1 DUB activity can contribute to the negative regulation. Of note, in conjunction with the E2 enzyme UBC13/UEV1A TRAF6 catalyzes attachment of K63-linked chains (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deng et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2001</a>), but TRAF6 and UBCH5A may build chains of different topology, including YOD1-sensitive K11-linked ubiquitin chains (<a href=\"#bib55\">Windheim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bosanac et al., 2011</a>). Further, K11-linked ubiquitin chains have been shown to be able to recruit NEMO and activate the IKK complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dynek et al., 2010</a>), but relevant K11-modified substrates in the IL-1 pathway have not yet been defined. Using linkage specific OTU DUBs, we do not see formation of K11 ubiquitin chains on TRAF6, but YOD1 DUB activity may also control TRAF6 ubiquitination indirectly, e.g. by changing overall ubiquitin attachment. Nevertheless, we provide evidence that YOD1 acts in a non-catalytic competitive manner to counteract TRAF6 activation by p62."

Importantly, all three DUBs are interfering with TRAF6 activity via distinct mechanisms and are thus controlling different steps of an NF-\u03baB response. As we described here for YOD1, CYLD is acting on TRAF6/p62 complexes, but - in contrast to YOD1 - CYLD is not preventing the formation of TRAF6/p62 aggregates, but is recruited to TRAF6 by p62 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wooten et al., 2008</a>). Upon recruitment, CYLD is hydrolyzing K63-linked ubiquitin chains generated by active TRAF6 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wooten et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yoshida et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jin et al., 2008</a>). Similar to YOD1, A20 is not able to efficiently cleave K63 ubiquitin linkages and DUB activity is not required for impeding TRAF6 activity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mevissen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shembade et al., 2010</a>). However, whereas YOD1 binds to TRAF6 in resting cells affecting C-terminal substrate binding, A20 is associating with TRAF6 only upon prolonged IL-1 stimulation to counteract binding of the E2 enzyme UBC13 to the RING-Z1 of TRAF6 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shembade et al., 2010</a>). Thus, CYLD and A20 act as negative feedback regulators that terminate post-inductive TRAF6 activity by a catalytic or non-catalytic mechanism, respectively. The YOD1/TRAF6 association in uninduced cells and the dissociation upon IL-1 stimulation indicate that YOD1 is acting in an earlier phase of the IL-1 response to counteract the accessibility of p62. In line, we show that early NF-\u03baB signaling and gene induction is increased upon YOD1 depletion. Since p62 exerts a dual role by first activating TRAF6 and later recruiting CYLD (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sanz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jin et al., 2008</a>), CYLD may at least partially impede enhanced signaling upon loss of YOD1 during an IL-1 response. Thus, our data together with the published data on CYLD and A20 reveal that the DUBs may act in a concerted manner at different steps of the pathway and that an interdependency of these negative regulators can potentially act as a fail-safe mechanism that can compensate for the loss of one another."

However, despite its role in NF-\u03baB signaling, p62 is not substantially involved in the activation of JNK by TRAF6 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sanz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Feng and Longmore, 2005</a>). Thus, normal JNK signaling in YOD1 knock-down cells further supports the notion that YOD1 is selectively acting on p62/TRAF6 complexes. Hence, TRAF6 activation of MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling seems to involve different subsets of TRAF6 interactors."

Quite unexpectedly, we did not observe enhanced NF-\u03baB signaling after YOD1 knock-down upon CD40 or RANK stimulation in 293 or PC3 cells. In contrast, NF-\u03baB activation was even impaired upon decreased YOD1 expression. However, in this cellular context p62 knock-down did not significantly influence CD40 and RANK signaling. Previously, Seibold et al reported that CD40-induced NF-\u03baB signaling was weakend in macrophages from p62-mutant mice, but unaffected in a human kidney tumor cell line after p62 knock-down (<a href=\"#bib45\">Seibold and Ehrenschwender, 2015</a>). Further, p62 was shown to be dispensable for immediate early NF-\u03baB signaling in response to RANK and it only controlled a second wave of NF-\u03baB activity in osteoclasts after several days of stimulation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dur\u00e1n et al., 2004</a>). Apparently, the results reveal a stimulation, cell-type and context-dependent role of p62 for different TRAF6-dependent signaling pathways, which may explain why YOD1 is not acting as a general negative regulator in all these settings. However, why and how YOD1 promotes canonical NF-\u03baB signaling and activation in the context of p62-independent CD40 or RANK stimulation is currently unclear and we can only speculate. Of note, YOD1 was originally identified as a co-factor of p97 in the regulation of protein quality control and the ERAD pathway (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ernst et al., 2009</a>). YOD1/TRAF6 binding is apparently independent of p97, suggesting that YOD1 affects NF-\u03baB signaling in response to IL-1 independent of this multifunctional AAA-ATPase. However, p97 was shown to positively regulate canonical NF-\u03baB signaling by facilitating proteasomal I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schweitzer et al., 2016</a>). Potentially, YOD1 could also function as a p97 co-factor for I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation to support canonical NF-\u03baB signaling, but it is unclear why this would affect signaling in response to some inducers (e.g. CD40) while others are unaffected (e.g. IL-1 and TNF). Future studies will need to address if a putative positive action of YOD1 is relying on TRAF6 and/or p97 and in how far this regulatory events are cell-type and context dependent."

However, changes in TRAF6 expression and TRAF6 oligomerization can activate downstream signaling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baud et al., 1999</a>). The C-terminal MATH of TRAF6 is an oligomerization and interaction domain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ha et al., 2009</a>) and stimulus-dependent recruitment of many adaptors including p62 is mediated by a consensus TRAF6 interaction motif (TIM) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ye et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Linares et al., 2013</a>). The putative TIM of YOD1 is not required for binding to the TRAF6 MATH domain, indicating a different binding mode of YOD1 in un-induced cells. Nevertheless, YOD1 specifically binds to TRAF6 and not to TRAF2, and consequently YOD1 counteracts TRAF6-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling from the IL-1R and not the TNFR. Since YOD1/TRAF6 interaction takes place in unstimulated cells, TRAF6 oligomerization is apparently not required, indicating that monomeric TRAF6 has a preference for binding to YOD1 over p62. Whether this is due to higher affinity or localization inside the cell needs to be elaborated, but the data suggest that YOD1 raises the threshold for TRAF6/p62 signaling to occur. Upon IL-1 stimulation, TRAF6 oligomerization may induce YOD1 dissociation, but also other processes like post-translational modification (e.g. TRAF6 ubiquitination) may play a role. The C-terminal MATH domain of TRAF6 associates with TIMs in various adaptors to regulate signaling in different settings. These adapters include MALT1 and Caspase8 in activated T cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sun et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Oeckinghaus et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bid\u00e8re et al., 2006</a>), TIFA after IL-1 stimulation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Takatsuna et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ea et al., 2004</a>) or TRIP6 in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulated cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lin et al., 2016</a>). The existence of the large number of adapters that enhance TRAF6 activity and signaling underscores the necessity for tight control and it will be interesting to analyze if YOD1 is influencing the recruitment of other C-terminal TRAF6 interaction partners to control NF-\u03baB signaling in different settings."

TRAF6 recruitment to p62 sequestosomes is enhanced upon IL-1\u03b2 stimulation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sanz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Sequestosomes are hotspots for signal transduction activity and in addition they can contribute to proteasomal degradation by co-localizing with the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib44\">Seibenhener et al., 2004</a>). For NF-\u03baB signaling, these two functions have been proposed to occur in a sequential process related to the progression of stimulation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Hence, freshly formed sequestosomes constitute a microenvironment for signaling to boost NF-\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Seibenhener et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sanz et al., 2000</a>). In the course of prolonged stimulation, sequestosomes mature into proteasome-organizing centers and NF-\u03baB signaling is terminated (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Our data indicate that YOD1 is able to counteract TRAF6 recruitment to sequestosomes and NF-\u03baB signaling. Future analyses must elucidate the exact order of events and how multiple positive and negative regulators contribute to faithful initiation, maintenance and termination of sequestosome-mediated IL-1 signaling to NF-\u03baB."

Cells were first infected with pLV-tTRKRAB-red vector (IRES exchanged for T2A) and afterwards with pLVTHM-based transfer vectors encoding YOD1 WT, YOD1 C160S or shYOD1 sequence, respectively, plus GFP as marker. For constitutive YOD1 expression, a single infection round with the transfer vector encoding YOD1 WT or empty transfer vector (mock) was conducted. Lentivirus production and transduction was essentially performed as described previously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hadian et al., 2011</a>), using pMD2.G and psPAX2 as envelope and packaging plasmids. Virus was applied to HeLa cells for about 18 hr. To induce protein or shRNA expression, cells were treated with 0,05 \u00b5g/ml DOX (Roth) for 72 hr. Transduction efficiency was analyzed by flow cytometry with an Attune Acoustic Focusing Cytometer System (Thermo Scientific) on the basis of GFP or dsRed expression. qRT-PCR and Western Blotting were performed to determine mRNA and protein expression, respectively.

To confirm that the effect of YOD1 on TRAF6 activation indeed relates to its ability to interfere with p62 binding to the latter, rather than affecting some other aspect of IL-1 signaling, the authors should check if ablation of YOD1 expression facilitates signaling in response to such other triggers."

The authors show that YOD1 interacts with the C-terminal MATH domain of TRAF6, and inhibits TRAF6 binding with p62/Sequestosome-1. Functional studies using HeLa YOD1 overexpression and knockout cells support the idea that YOD1 is a negative regulator of IL-1-induced NF-\u03baB activation. YOD1 appears to inhibit TRAF6 by a noncatalytic mechanism since the YOD1 C160S mutant still inhibits IL-1-NF-\u03baB signaling. Overall, this is a very thorough and interesting study and the data are convincing for the most part. However, a weakness of the study that needs to be addressed is that much of the data were generated using overexpression strategies in cell lines (mainly HeLa and 293)."

Quite to our surprise, we found that in both settings TRAF6 but not p62 is required for optimal NF-\u03baB activation. However, the requirement of p62 for initial TRAF6-dependent CD40 and RANK signaling is not so clear (see also below response to reviewer# 1; Duran et al., Dev Cell 2004; Seibold et al., JCMM, 2015). Further, YOD1 was not antagonizing NF-\u03baB activation after CD40L and RANKL stimulation, but even necessary for NF-\u03baB signaling. Thus, the data are pointing to a more complex interplay in which depending on the stimulus, YOD1 can act as a negative or a positive regulator of NF-\u03baB and we included these important data. At the moment, we cannot resolve how YOD1 exerts these opposing effects. Of note, it is even possible that the positive effect is relying on YOD1 activity as a cofactor of p97/VCP, which was recently shown to enhance I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. We changed the Discussion (third paragraph). However, we think that in this manuscript we need to keep the focus on IL-1R signaling that clearly relies on the interplay of TRAF6 and p62 (see also our response to reviewer#1). All experiments and changes have been described in more detail in the point by point response to the reviewer comments. We are confident that we have been able to adequately address the issues and to improve the manuscript."

The data yielded quite unexpected results. First, TRAF6 but not p62 knock-down significantly affected NF-\u03baB activation in response to CD40-L (CD40 293 cells) or RANKL (PC3 cells). However, looking at the literature it becomes clear that the role of p62 in CD40 and RANK signaling is not so clear. In fact, p62 knock-down did not affect CD40 signaling in the renal adenocarcinoma cell 786-O and CD40 signaling was only slightly reduced in primary macrophages from mice carrying a p62 truncation that deletes the TRAF6 binding region (Seibold et al., BBRC 2015). Also, early RANK signaling to NF-\u03baB was not impaired in p62 KO osteoclasts, but only a second wave of NF-\u03baB response after several days of stimulation was abolished (Duran et al., Dev Cell 2004). Thus, the role of p62 on TRAF6 signaling is apparently highly stimulus and cell-type specific. To our surprise, in the largely p62-independent early activation of NF- \u03baB after CD40 or RANK stimulation, YOD1 knock-down led to decreased NF-\u03baB signaling, suggesting a positive rather than a negative effect on the signaling pathway. We include these data, because we think it is quite important to report on these findings. We included a new part in the Discussion (third paragraph). At the moment, there is no simple explanation for these results, e.g. that YOD1 is a positive regulator for TRAF6-dependent and p62-independent pathways. One interesting aspect is that YOD1 acts as a p97 co-factor. p97 was recently shown to enhance I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and to augment NF-\u03baB activation (Li et al., MCB 2014; Schweitzer et al., JCMM 2016). Possibly, YOD1 exerts a positive effect by facilitating p97-dependent I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, but it is unclear why this would not be the case for IL-1 or TNF signaling. Thus, at present we think that we need to focus the study largely on the well-characterized TRAF6/p62-dependent IL-1 signaling. Future analyses must determine how YOD1 can exert opposing effects on different TRAF6 signaling pathways."

Functional studies using HeLa YOD1 overexpression and knockout cells support the idea that YOD1 is a negative regulator of IL-1-induced NF-\u03baB activation. YOD1 appears to inhibit TRAF6 by a noncatalytic mechanism since the YOD1 C160S mutant still inhibits IL-1-NF-\u03baB signaling.

The Western Blot in the UbiCrest looks different and the quality is not quite as strong, because the signals are decreased after the additional DUB incubation time (30 min at 37\u00b0C). However, the experiment clearly shows that only the promiscuous DUB USP2 and the K63-specific DUB AMSH significantly decreased TRAF6- ubiquitination. Since it is well documented that TRAF6 is generating K63 ubiquitin chains and these chains cannot be efficiently hydrolyzed by YOD1, we feel that this is sufficient to support our assumption that YOD1 acts largely through a non-catalytic mechanism."

Consistent with this result, shRNA knockdown of YOD1 increases expression of the same three genes. Does doxycycline treatment alone (without YOD1 expression) alter IL-1\u03b2 activation of NF-\u03baB in the parental cells?</i>"
