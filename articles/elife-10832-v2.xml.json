However, Seidel and Kimble found that the germline quiescence caused by starvation maintains the stem cell state even when Notch signaling is prevented. This suggests that, in the absence of food, quiescence alone can maintain germline stem cells, although how it does so remains a question for future work. One possibility is that quiescence stabilizes other molecules involved in the Notch signaling pathway or prevents the production of proteins that enable a stem cell to develop into a specialized cell."

Such quiescence was viewed as an inherent property of the stem cell fate and thus essential for a tissue\u2019s long-term self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib51\">Hall and Watt, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Potten and Loeffler, 1990</a>). More recently, however, it has become clear that adult stem cells are not universally quiescent but instead cycle in accordance with the needs of the tissue: Some types of stem cells proliferate continuously, whereas others switch from quiescence to rapid proliferation in response to certain stimuli (e.g. wounding or hormones) (<a href=\"#bib122\">Wabik and Jones, 2015</a>). In mammals, for example, hematopoietic and neural stem cells reversibly switch between quiescence and active proliferation in response to tissue injury (<a href=\"#bib34\">Doetsch et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Harrison and Lerner, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Lugert et al., 2010</a>), and mammary stem cells expand transiently during pregnancy and the estrus cycle (<a href=\"#bib6\">Asselin-Labat et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Joshi et al., 2010</a>). Though periods of sustained stem cell proliferation enable rapid tissue growth or turnover, they challenge the view of quiescence as a prerequisite for the stem cell fate. Thus, a long-standing question has remained unanswered: Does cell-cycle quiescence play a role in stem cell maintenance?"

Such a test requires a system in which cell-cycle quiescence can be readily induced, and in which the signals otherwise required for stem cell maintenance can be readily removed. In this study, we establish the adult germline of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a model fitting these criteria. We describe a previously uncharacterized state of cell-cycle quiescence among adult germline stem cells, emerging under conditions of starvation. We then test whether this quiescence can maintain stem cells, independent of the signal required for their maintenance under conditions of active proliferation."

These effects are mediated in part by changes in the somatic gonad (<a href=\"#bib125\">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</a>), including changes in the size of the somatic niche supporting germline stem cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bonfini et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Hsu and Drummond-Barbosa, 2011</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i>, primordial germ cells are born in the early embryo and arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle until newly hatched larvae begin to feed (<a href=\"#bib13\">Butuci et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Fukuyama et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Fukuyama et al., 2012</a>). This response to feeding has been hypothesized to involve food-related signals traveling through soma-to-germline gap junctions, which are required early in larval development for germ cell proliferation and survival (<a href=\"#bib118\">Starich et al., 2014</a>). Later in development, germ cells stop dividing if animals enter the non-feeding dauer larval stage (<a href=\"#bib94\">Narbonne and Roy, 2006</a>). Even in non-dauer larvae, germ cells proliferate less when food is scarce, an effect mediated in part by communication between food-sensing neurons and the somatic gonad (<a href=\"#bib31\">Dalfo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Korta et al., 2012</a>). In adult <i>C. elegans</i>, decreased food intake slows mitotic and meiotic progression and oogenesis (<a href=\"#bib47\">Gerhold et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Lopez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Salinas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Seidel and Kimble, 2011</a>), and limited observations suggest that germ cell proliferation is also reduced (<a href=\"#bib108\">Salinas et al., 2006</a>). More strikingly, full starvation from the L4 larval stage causes dramatic germline shrinkage in adult hermaphrodites, and this shrinkage is reversible upon re-feeding (<a href=\"#bib4\">Angelo and Van Gilst, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Seidel and Kimble, 2011</a>). These observations motivated us to examine in greater detail how mitotically dividing germ cells in adult <i>C. elegans</i> respond to food removal."

This quiescence is characterized by a dramatic slowing of S phase, cell-cycle arrest in G2, and the ability to re-enter M phase rapidly in response to re-feeding. We investigate these cell-cycle responses in wildtype animals and in germline tumors, and we test whether this cell-cycle quiescence requires factors controlling larval or behavioral responses to food. We next investigate the control of stem cell maintenance under starved conditions. We uncover a major difference in the requirement for GLP-1/Notch signaling in the maintenance of actively proliferating versus quiescent germline stem cells. This work establishes the <i>C. elegans</i> germline as a model of facultative stem cell quiescence and demonstrates the utility of such a model in clarifying the role of quiescence in maintaining the stem cell state."

Cells in M phase were identified by staining for phospho-histone H3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), a marker of M phase (<a href=\"#bib52\">Hans and Dimitrov, 2001</a>). Food removal caused a drop in the number of M-phase cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and this response was fast: In hermaphrodites, the number of M-phase cells per progenitor zone dropped from an average of 7.6 before food removal to 2.1 after 30 min without food (n = 7 replicates of 220\u2013551 gonadal arms per replicate per time\u00a0point) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The number of M-phase cells continued to decline thereafter, and after 3.5\u2009hr without food, M-phase cells were virtually absent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This drop in M-phase cells did not occur in hermaphrodites fed continuously (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B, D</a>), nor in hermaphrodites exposed to a mock starvation procedure (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In males, M-phase cells also disappeared rapidly in response to food removal, although the initial drop in M-phase cells was not monotonically decreasing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We conclude that in adults of both sexes, germ cells stop dividing quickly in the absence of food."

This extension was motivated by the need to perform certain later experiments in such animals, as starvation from L4 prolongs the amount of time that adult hermaphrodites can be maintained without food (<a href=\"#bib4\">Angelo and Van Gilst, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Seidel and Kimble, 2011</a>). We removed food from mid-L4 hermaphrodites and monitored the number of cells in M phase, as above. In starved L4s, M-phase cells persisted for ~4\u20135\u2009hr after food removal, with the average number of M-phase cells only moderately reduced relative to fed animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Thereafter, the number of M-phase cells declined rapidly, and after 10.5\u2009hr without food, M-phase cells had virtually disappeared (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The disappearance of M-phase cells coincided with the molt into adulthood (~5\u20138\u2009hr after food removal), and the coincidence of these events persisted even under conditions where the timing of this molt was changed: Hermaphrodites starved from early L4 molted into adulthood ~12\u201320\u2009hr after food removal, and gonads in these animals contained, on average, 1.6 M-phase cells per progenitor zone before the molt (n = 57, gonads collected 10.5\u2009hr post food removal) and 0.0 M-phase cells after the molt (n = 63, gonads collected 24\u2009hr post food removal). These results demonstrate that germ cells in hermaphrodites starved from L4 do not immediately stop dividing in response to food removal, but germ cell division eventually ceases, at or near the molt into adulthood. This finding suggests that mitotically dividing germ cells in L4s are not equivalent to those in adults, a result consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Crittenden et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Dalfo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Gerhold et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Michaelson et al., 2010</a>)."

We therefore tested whether longer periods of starvation would delay mitotic re-entry upon re-feeding. We repeated the re-feeding time\u00a0course in two types of animals having experienced longer starvation: Adult hermaphrodites starved from mid-L4 for 24\u2009hr and adult hermaphrodites starved from early L4 for 72\u2009hr.

Our estimates of median cell-cycle length are within the range reported by others (<a href=\"#bib28\">Crittenden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Fox et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Morgan et al., 2010</a>), and the long-tailed distribution of G2 lengths is consistent with estimates of maximal cell-cycle length being considerably longer than estimates of median cell-cycle length (<a href=\"#bib28\">Crittenden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Fox et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Morgan et al., 2010</a>)."

We removed food from animals of both sexes and, after varying amounts of time, calculated the fraction of progenitor-zone cells in G1, S phase, and G2. S-phase cells were identified by EdU labeling, and G1 versus G2 cells were distinguished by nuclear size (see \u2018Use of nuclear size to distinguish G1 versus G2 cells\u2019 in Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The following time\u00a0points were collected: Animals starved from early adult for 3.5, 6.5, and 10.5\u2009hr; animals starved from mid-L4 for 10.5 and 24\u2009hr; and animals starved from early L4 for 10.5, 24, 48, and 72\u2009hr. For all three age groups and for both sexes, G1 cells disappeared following food removal, and the timing of their disappearance coincided with the disappearance of M-phase cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This result demonstrates that during starvation, G1 cells continued to initiate S phase without a pronounced delay. Our second observation was that for all age groups and sexes, the fraction of S-phase cells decreased over time during starvation, and the fraction of G2 cells increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However, S-phase and G2 fractions changed more slowly during starvation than expected from measurements of S-phase length in fed animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). (For example, in hermaphrodites starved from early adult, S-phase fractions changed very little during the 7 hr between time\u00a0points 3.5\u2009hr and 10.5\u2009hr [<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>], indicating that progression through S phase during this time period was minimal. By contrast, cells in fed adult hermaphrodites complete S phase in a median of ~4.4\u20136.8\u2009hr [<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>].) We conclude that during starvation, germ cells do not pause in G1 and instead continue through S phase and arrest in G2. However, S-phase progression occurs much more slowly than under fed conditions."

We re-fed starved animals and determined the length of time until all germ cells entered M phase. This analysis is complementary to our initial monitoring of M-phase cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) because our initial monitoring allowed us to detect the earliest germ cells to enter M-phase upon re-feeding, whereas this analysis allowed us to detect the slowest such cells. To detect M-phase entry of all cells, we blocked M-phase exit using a temperature-sensitive mutation in <i>emb-30</i>, which encodes a component of the anaphase-promoting complex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Furuta et al., 2000</a>). <i>emb-30(tn377ts)</i> hermaphrodites were starved at the permissive temperature (15\u00b0C), then shifted to the restrictive temperature (25\u00b0C), and re-fed. At the time of re-feeding, germlines contained a mixture of S-phase and G2 cells (data not shown). In response to re-feeding, germ cells entered M phase, as expected, but were unable to complete the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, thus enabling us to quantify the accumulation of M-phase cells: Two hours after re-feeding, 55% of cells, on average, had entered M phase (n = 60 gonadal arms); after 4 hr, this number reached 99% (n = 66 gonadal arms) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). (This analysis is restricted to the distal-most 50 germ cells, because germ cells located more proximally sometimes directly entered the meiotic cell cycle upon re-feeding. See <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>.) Therefore, virtually all mitotically dividing germ cells completed the remainder\u00a0of S phase and G2 within 4 hr of re-feeding, a time shorter than the time required to complete all of S phase and G2 in continuously fed adult hermaphrodites (~4.4\u20136.8\u2009hr for S-phase, plus ~1.3\u20132.3\u2009hr for G2). Thus, not only does re-feeding trigger germ cells arrested in G2 to enter M phase, but re-feeding also restores the rate of progression through S phase and earlier stages of G2."

The distal tip cell forms the niche for germline stem cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Kimble and Seidel, 2013</a>) and influences how germ cells respond to physiological cues (<a href=\"#bib31\">Dalfo et al., 2012</a>). We therefore tested the effect of proximity to the distal tip cell on cell-cycle responses to food removal and re-feeding. We monitored M-phase cells, as above, in two mutant backgrounds in which mitotically dividing germ cells fill the gonad (i.e. germline tumors): (i) <i>glp-1(oz112gf)/Notch</i> gain-of-function mutants, in which constitutive GLP-1/Notch signaling maintains all germ cells in the mitotic cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib11\">Berry et al., 1997</a>) and (ii) <i>gld-3(q730) nos-3(q650)</i> loss-of-function mutants, in which meiotic entry is inhibited irrespective of GLP-1/Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib17\">Byrd et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Eckmann et al., 2004</a>). Germ cells in both genotypes of germline tumors responded normally to starvation and re-feeding: Outside the region normally corresponding to the progenitor zone (i.e. outside the distal-most 20 rows of germ cells), M-phase cells disappeared quickly in response to food removal and re-bounded 1 to 2 hr after re-feeding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). These results demonstrate that proximity to the distal tip cell\u2014the germline stem cell niche\u2014is not required for a normal starvation and re-feeding response. Additionally, these results refine our understanding of the control of germ cell fate: Constitutive GLP-1/Notch signaling or combined loss of <i>gld-3</i> and <i>nos-3</i> does not promote germ cell proliferation per se, but rather promotes an undifferentiated fate in which cells divide only in the presence of food."

This morphology is readily distinguishable from the \u2018non-crescent\u2019 morphology found in mitotic interphase. In fed controls, incubation at the restrictive temperature caused all germ cells to enter the meiotic cell cycle: Chromosomes adopted the \u2018crescent\u2019 shape (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), and GLD-1 levels in the distal-most germ cells rose (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). In starved animals, by contrast, meiotic entry did not occur: 99% (n = 214) of progenitor zones retained germ cells with a interphase chromosome morphology (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), and GLD-1 levels in the distal-most germ cells remained low (n = 47 of 47 gonadal arms) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). Importantly, germ cells in starved animals retained the capacity for mitotic cell division, because when starved animals were re-fed at the restrictive temperature, their germ cells re-entered M phase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Germ cells in starved animals also retained the capacity for long-term self-renewal, because when starved animals were instead returned to the permissive temperature and re-fed for 2\u20133 days, 91% (n = 148) of progenitor zones retained germ cells in the mitotic cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Similar results were observed when incubation at the restrictive temperature was extended to 16\u2009hr or 24\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). These results demonstrate that starved animals maintain germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch. In other words, starvation inhibits the meiotic entry of germline stem cells, even in the absence of GLP-1/Notch. Similar to cell-cycle quiescence, this inhibition of meiotic entry was reversible upon re-feeding, because when starved <i>glp-1(q224ts)</i> animals were re-fed at the restrictive temperature, all germ cells eventually entered the meiotic cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>)."

To answer this question, we performed temperature-shift experiments in <i>glp-1(q224ts)</i> hermaphrodites under two additional conditions: High NaCl and absence of sperm, each of which causes a twofold drop in the germ cell mitotic index (<a href=\"#bib91\">Morgan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Salinas et al., 2006</a>). Animals exposed to high NaCl (300 mM) or lacking sperm (via loss-of-function mutation in <i>fog-1</i>) were grown at the permissive temperature, shifted to the restrictive temperature for 8 hr, and then returned to the permissive temperature for 2\u20133 days. Following this treatment, germ cell fate (mitotic versus meiotic) was evaluated by scoring germ cells for the \u2018crescent\u2019 chromosome morphology indicative of meiotic prophase (described above). For both high NaCl and absence of sperm, 48\u201379% (n = 129\u2013231) of gonadal arms retained germ cells in the mitotic cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013F</a>). To control for possible pleiotropic effects of the mutation used to eliminate sperm (<i>q785</i>), sperm was introduced to <i>fog-1(q785); glp-1(q224ts)</i> animals by mating with wildtype males, and these animals were examined in parallel. In such animals, incubation at the restrictive temperature caused all germ cells to enter the meiotic cell cycle (data not shown; n = 37 gonadal arms, scored immediately following incubation at the restrictive temperature). Thus, three stress conditions that inhibit or reduce germ cell division (starvation, high NaCl, and absence of sperm) also permitted maintenance of germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch. This commonality suggests that cell-cycle quiescence itself is an effector of stem cell maintenance (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). Nonetheless, such maintenance is not simply a function of inhibiting passage through M-phase, because stem cell maintenance in the absence of GLP-1/Notch was not permitted by cell-cycle arrest caused by RNAi knockdown of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (<i>cdk-1</i>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), a result we confirmed by visualizing formation of the synaptonemal complex (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure\u00a06\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We therefore hypothesized that starvation might also control the meiotic entry of transient progenitors, located in the proximal progenitor zone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). No markers currently exist to distinguish transient progenitors from germline stem cells, and the boundary between these pools of cells is not clear, but the two pools can be distinguished under fed conditions by restricting movement of cells out of the progenitor zone\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Cinquin et al., 2010</a>). Under such conditions, transient progenitors enter the meiotic cell\u00a0cycle, whereas germline stem cells do not (<a href=\"#bib23\">Cinquin et al., 2010</a>). To compare meiotic entry of transient progenitors under fed versus starved conditions, we re-fed starved animals and restricted cell movement during re-feeding; we then compared meiotic entry after re-feeding to meiotic entry after continued starvation. Meiotic entry was assessed by staining for GLD-1 and by scoring cells for the \u2018crescent\u2019 chromosome morphology indicative of meiotic prophase (described above). Cell movement was restricted by performing this experiment in <i>emb-30(tn377ts)</i> hermaphrodites at the restrictive temperature (25\u00b0C), a condition that induces metaphase arrest (also described above, under \u2018Re-feeding restores the rate of progression through S phase and G2\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Furuta et al., 2000</a>). <i>emb-30(tn377ts)</i> animals were starved at the permissive temperature (15\u00b0C), shifted to the restrictive temperature (25\u00b0C), and then re-fed for 6 hr or maintained in starvation. Our primary result from this experiment was that re-feeding and continued starvation affected meiotic entry differently. After 6 hr of re-feeding, cells in the proximal (but not distal) progenitor zone entered the meiotic cell cycle: GLD-1 levels in the proximal half of the progenitor zone rose (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and the boundary between \u2018crescent\u2019 and \u2018non-crescent\u2019 germ cells moved distally, such that the number of cells distal to this boundary was reduced by about half (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). After 6 hr of continued starvation, by contrast, very little meiotic entry was observed: GLD-1 levels in the proximal progenitor zone remained largely unchanged (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and the number of cells distal to the \u2018crescent\u2019/\u2019non-crescent\u2019 boundary was only slightly reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Our inference from these results is that the proximal half of the progenitor zone was composed of transient progenitors at the start of re-feeding, and that 6 hr of re-feeding\u2014but not 6 hr of continued starvation\u2014allowed for their timely progression into the meiotic cell cycle. We conclude that starvation slows or blocks the meiotic entry of transient progenitors, similar to its effect on the meiotic entry of germline stem cells."

Following three criteria, starvation-induced quiescence was distinct from cell-cycle arrest caused by DNA damage. First, DNA damage strongly up-regulates inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK-1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Craig et al., 2012</a>). By contrast, starvation-induced quiescence did not up-regulate this phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Second, DNA damage causes germ cell nuclei to enlarge (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Gartner et al., 2000</a>), a phenotype replicated by RNAi knockdown of <i>cdk-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Jeong et al., 2011</a>). By contrast, starvation-induced quiescence did not cause nuclei to enlarge (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Third, cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage requires the p53 homolog <i>cep-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Derry et al., 2007</a>). By contrast, starvation-induced quiescence did not require <i>cep-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We conclude that starvation and DNA damage induce cell-cycle arrest differently."

Food was removed from early adult hermaphrodites homozygous for mutations in the transforming growth factor beta\u00a0(TGF-\u03b2) pathway, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathway, or the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. M-phase cells were then monitored after food removal. Additionally, to test for a requirement for factors affecting behavioral responses to food, this same experiment was performed in animals defective for neuropeptide processing, neuropeptide secretion, or chemosensation, as well as in animals exposed to exogenous serotonin, which in some contexts acts as a food signal (<a href=\"#bib83\">Luedtke et al., 2010</a>). In all experiments, M-phase cells disappeared quickly in response to food removal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We conclude that each of the genes tested is not individually required for starvation-induced quiescence in adult germ cells;\u00a0likewise, quiescence is not affected by exogenous serotonin. These findings suggest that quiescence in adults is controlled differently than cell-cycle responses in the larval germline and is largely independent of behavioral responses to food. These results are consistent with adult versus larval germ cells responding to food removal differently (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> versus C) and with reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling or TGF-\u03b2 signaling not affecting the germ cell mitotic index in fed adult hermaphrodites (<a href=\"#bib31\">Dalfo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Michaelson et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, these results are consistent with no requirement for <i>daf-16/FOXO</i> in reducing the proliferation of <i>Drosophila</i> germline stem cells in response to poor diet (<a href=\"#bib57\">Hsu et al., 2008</a>)."

Briefly, we find that in the absence of food, adult germ cells in <i>C. elegans</i> stop dividing and become quiescent\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This quiescence is characterized by a slowing of S phase and a block to M-phase entry, such that cells arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Further, this quiescence maintains germline stem cells independent of GLP-1/Notch, a signal required for stem cell maintenance under conditions of active proliferation. Re-feeding causes germ cells to exit quiescence rapidly, and a requirement for GLP-1/Notch signaling similarly resumes."

This view arose from the theory that biological systems ought to protect stem cells from the risks of DNA replication and led to the notion of quiescence as an inherent property of the stem cell fate. According to this model, tissues were maintained by a hierarchy of relatively quiescent master stem cells and their faster\u00a0cycling but short-lived daughters. In recent years, however, work in several mammalian and invertebrate tissues has shown that quiescence is not a prerequisite for the stem cell fate (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barker et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Crittenden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Doupe and Jones, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Fuchs, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Maciejowski et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Simons and Clevers, 2011</a>). Some types of stem cells do not exhibit quiescence under conditions assayed (e.g. <a href=\"#bib9\">Barker et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">de Navascues et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Snippert et al., 2010</a>), and still others vary their cell-cycle length in accordance with the physiological circumstances surrounding them (e.g. <a href=\"#bib53\">Harrison and Lerner, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Hartman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Lugert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Qiao et al., 2007</a>). Nevertheless, genetic or environmental perturbations that impact the cell cycle can also affect stemness (<a href=\"#bib96\">Orford and Scadden, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Pietras et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib126\">Yilmaz et al., 2012</a>). Thus, a long-standing question in the field of stem cell biology has remained: Does cell-cycle quiescence play a role in maintaining the stem cell fate? Our results answer this question by showing that quiescence itself alters the genetic requirements for stemness: Actively dividing germline stem cells in <i>C. elegans</i> require GLP-1/Notch signaling for their maintenance (<a href=\"#bib7\">Austin and Kimble, 1987</a>); we find that cell-cycle quiescence\u2014induced by starvation, high NaCl, or absence of sperm\u2014relieves this requirement (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). Thus, cell-cycle quiescence maintains germline stem cells independent of the signal required for such maintenance under conditions of active proliferation."

Acting downstream of GLP-1/Notch signaling to maintain germline stem cells are the PUF-family translational repressors FBF-1 and FBF-2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Crittenden et al., 2002</a>) and the proteins of unknown molecular function LST-1 and SYGL-1 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Kershner et al., 2014</a>). Quiescence might stabilize these stem cell regulators\u2014for example, by inhibiting the protein degradation machinery linked to the cell-cycle. Alternatively, quiescence might substitute for the repressive effects of FBF-1 and FBF-2 by repressing translation on a global level. Global repression of translation is a conserved stress response (<a href=\"#bib117\">Spriggs et al., 2010</a>), and the stress of starvation represses translation of at least a few genes in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib76\">Lascarez-Lagunas et al., 2014</a>). Another possibility is that stem cell maintenance might be regulated by a metabolite or metabolic process whose levels change during quiescence. Such connections between metabolism and developmental processes have been observed in a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate cell types (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agathocleous and Harris, 2013</a>)."

Moreover, the G2-to-M transition is a point of cell-cycle control in response to poor nutrient conditions in germline stem cells of <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Hsu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">LaFever et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Roth et al., 2012</a>). Even under replete conditions, germline stem cells in <i>Drosophila</i> are thought to be paused in G2 (<a href=\"#bib92\">Morris and Spradling, 2011</a>), as are a substantial fraction of <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal stem cells (<a href=\"#bib129\">Zielke et al., 2016</a>). In mammals, cells can pause in G2 for prolonged periods of time before dividing in response to various stimuli (e.g. wounding, hormones) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib46\">Gelfant, 1977</a>). Such pausing in mammals has not been the subject of recent investigation, although the G2-to-M transition is known to be regulated by the growth factor IGF-1\u2014for example, in mammalian uterine cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adesanya et al., 1999</a>), oligodendrocyte progenitors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Frederick and Wood, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Min et al., 2012</a>), spermatogonial stem cells (<a href=\"#bib123\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), and multiple myeloma cells (<a href=\"#bib119\">Stromberg et al., 2006</a>). Proper timing of the G2-to-M transition is also essential during development (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib15\">Bouldin and Kimelman, 2014</a>), with some populations of cells naturally held in G2 in both <i>Drosophila</i> and zebrafish (e.g. <a href=\"#bib15\">Bouldin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib120\">Usai and Kimura, 1992</a>). Thus, the control of the G2-to-M transition by growth factors or nutrients may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic cell cycle."

                                "text": "Tissues in adult organisms can be remarkably plastic in their ability to shrink and re-grow in response to changing physiological demands (e.g. <a href=\"#bib10\">Bergtold, 1926</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Secor and Diamond, 1998</a>). Such plasticity requires broad flexibility in a range of cellular behaviors, yet our understanding of tissue plasticity on a cellular level is limited, primarily because tractable models of tissue plasticity are only now being developed (e.g. <a href=\"#bib95\">O'Brien et al., 2011</a>). The <i>C. elegans</i> germline presents such a model. This tissue undergoes dramatic shrinkage in adult hermaphrodites starved from the L4 larval stage, and such shrinkage is reversible upon re-feeding (<a href=\"#bib4\">Angelo and Van Gilst, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Seidel and Kimble, 2011</a>). Previous studies showed that germline shrinkage occurs in part through programmed cell death and oogenesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Angelo and Van Gilst, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Seidel and Kimble, 2011</a>). This work establishes facultative stem cell quiescence as a third major force: Because germ cells stop dividing during starvation, cells lost to cell death and oogenesis are not replaced, thus causing the germline tissue to shrink. Quiescence also contributes to re-growth during re-feeding by ensuring that germ cells are able to re-enter the cell cycle rapidly in response to food. Rapid exit from quiescence is a characteristic shared by analogous re-feeding responses in other animals, at least in the handful of examples where such responses have been examined at short time\u00a0scales\u2014for example, in the ovary of protein-limited <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib54\">Hartman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Jouandin et al., 2014</a>), in the gut of fasted rats, squirrels, and chicks (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aldewachi et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cameron and Cleffmann, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Hagemann and Stragand, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Kruman et al., 1988</a>), and in the retina of yolk-deprived frog embryos (<a href=\"#bib82\">Love et al., 2014</a>). These observations stand in contrast to the comparatively longer times required for exit from quiescence in mammalian tissue culture (<a href=\"#bib85\">Lum et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Pardee, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Soprano, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib128\">Zetterberg and Larsson, 1985</a>) and suggest that in vivo models of quiescence may uncover new mechanisms of cell-cycle control."

In pilot experiments involving EdU labeling and DNA quantification, we noticed a correlation between cell-cycle stage and nuclear size: G1 and early S-phase nuclei were small, G2 and late S-phase nuclei were large, and mid S-phase nuclei were intermediate in size (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Additionally, G1 nuclei nearly always occurred in pairs, consistent with G1 being very short (<a href=\"#bib38\">Fox et al., 2011</a>). The size difference between G1 and G2 nuclei was large enough that in EdU-labeled gonads, G1 and G2 nuclei could be distinguished by eye (n &gt; 100 nuclei, from a total of seven progenitor zones). To test the accuracy of this method more thoroughly, we obtained z-stack images of EdU-labeled, propidium iodide-stained progenitor zones from three fed early adult hermaphrodites and three hermaphrodites starved from early adult for 3.5\u2009hr. We first classified each cell as S-phase (EdU<sup>+</sup>), G1 (EdU<sup>\u2212</sup>\u00a0and having a nuclear size equal to or smaller than the smallest EdU<sup>+</sup> cells), or G2 (EdU<sup>\u2212</sup>\u00a0and having a nuclear size equal to or larger than the largest EdU<sup>+</sup> cells). We then quantified propidium iodide staining (a measure of DNA content) and compared our \u2018by size\u2019 classification to the classification given by propidium iodide staining (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For all cells in all six progenitor zones, the two classification systems matched perfectly (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Next, the length of G2 was combined with the G2 index to calculate the total length of the cell cycle (equation 2). The lengths of G1, S-phase, and M-phase were calculated by multiplying the total length of the cell cycle by the G1, S-phase, or M-phase indices (equations 3\u20135). Calculations of the maximum total length of the cell cycle depend on assumptions about covariance between the length of G2 and the length of M + G1 + S.

Animals were then shifted to 25\u00b0C for 14\u2009hr and either re-fed or maintained in starvation. Gonads were dissected immediately before re-feeding and at 1-hr intervals 2\u20136\u2009hr after re-feeding. Gonads were also dissected after 6\u2009hr of continued starvation. Gonads were stained for phospho-histone H3 and GLD-1 and imaged at 63\u00d7 magnification with a z-stack interval of 1 \u00b5m. Cells were identified using IRISES (<a href=\"#bib121\">Vogel et al., 2014</a>), followed by manual correction using the Cell Counter plug-in in Image J. Cells were classified as interphase, M-phase, or \u2018crescent\u2019 (i.e. meiotic prophase) according to chromosome morphology and phospho-histone H3 staining. Occasionally, at the later re-feeding time\u00a0points, cells were observed bypassing the metaphase arrest; for the purposes of this experiment, such cells were classified as M-phase. Cells distal to the \u2018crescent\u2019/\u2018non-crescent\u2019 boundary were defined as cells whose midpoints were located distal to a cross-sectional line drawn through the midpoint of the second most distal \u2018crescent\u2019 cell. Relative positions of cells along the distal-to-proximal axis were determined by collapsing cell positions along the <i>z</i>-axis and fitting these positions to a second-degree polynomial curve. Positions along this polynomial curve closest to each germ cell and closest to the distal tip cell were identified by solving, for each cell, the polynomial whose roots minimize this distance. Using this new set of positions, distances between the distal tip cell and each germ cell were calculated. Cells were then ranked according to these distances."

As a paradigm, the authors studied the effect of starvation on the adult germline stem cells of <i>C. elegans</i>, and report that starvation blocks stem cells in G2, and that this block is reversible upon re-feeding. The authors provide experimental evidence indicating that GLP-1/Notch signaling is not needed under conditions of quiescence, and that the starvation response of adult germline stem cells is independent of known signaling pathways shown to mediate nutritional sensing, such as insulin signaling, TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and neuropeptide signaling. Based on these and other data Seidel put forward a model of starvation regulation they refer to as \"facultative quiescence\" defined by a slow S phase that is coupled to a block in M phase, and which is independent of GLP-1/Notch Signaling. Overall, the data and methods introduced in this article not only expand the methodological toolkit to study germline stem cells, but also contribute in significant ways to our understanding of the nutritional regulation of animal stem cells."

The first, from one of the reviewers, Dr. Greenstein (Starich et al., 2014) in which it was shown that soma germline gap junctions are as important as the GLP-1/Notch pathway for controlling germline stem cells. In the absence of these junctions, germ cells can neither proliferate nor differentiate, even if the GLP-1/Notch pathway is constitutively activated. These gap junctions enable the transit of small molecules, ions, and metabolites between germline and soma, thereby providing a potential mechanism for nutritional inputs to the germline. The second is a major paper from Tim Schedl's lab (Fox and Schedl, 2015), which substantially refines our understanding of germline stem cell behavior in <i>C. elegans</i>. After this publication, it seems questionable (or controversial at the very least) whether it is correct to refer to a proximal population of \"transit-amplifying cells\" in this system (as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> here). A more complete consideration of Fox and Schedl (2015) raises an alternative interpretation of the authors' glp-1/Notch temperature-shift experiment (Major Point 1, below).

Upon moving back to 15C and re-feeding, germ cells complete their mitotic division and return to a situation in which GLP-1/Notch signaling is re-established. The authors interpret a <i>cdk-1</i>(RNAi) experiment as evidence that a G2 block is insufficient to prevent meiotic entry. Inspection of the Methods section associated with this experiment (subsection \u201cTemperature shifts\u201d, third paragraph) does not provide sufficient information as to the reliability of the method to score meiotic entry in these gonads by DNA morphology. The authors should consider evaluating meiotic entry by analyzing the recruitment of meiosis-specific chromosomal proteins to chromatin (e.g., HIM-3, etc.).

First, we wished to convey the idea that cells in the proximal progenitor zone are in the mitotic cell cycle. This idea is supported by many studies, including Fox and Schedl (2015). Second, we wished to convey the idea that cells in the proximal progenitor zone are in a transitional state. This idea is supported by three key observations: (i) cells in the proximal progenitor zone have higher levels of the meiosis-associated protein GLD-1 than cells in the distal progenitor zone (many studies); (ii) cells in the proximal progenitor zone have lower levels of the stem cell regulators <i>sygl-1</i> and <i>lst-1</i> than cells in the distal progenitor zone (Kershner et al., 2014); and (iii) cells in the proximal progenitor zone enter the meiotic cell cycle when their movement out of the progenitor zone is restricted, whereas cells in the distal progenitor zone arrest in the mitotic cell cycle and do not enter meiosis with that treatment (Cinquin et al., 2010). Based on these multiple lines of evidence, we sought terminology that would convey the idea that cells in the proximal progenitor zone are in a transitional yet mitotically dividing state. The term \u2018transit-amplifying cells\u2019 terms has long been used in the stem cell literature to mean just that \u2013 progeny of stem cells that continue to divide mitotically but that have limited division potential and have begun to differentiate."

Yet we have mixed feelings about this replacement. The reviewers argue that \u2018amplifying\u2019 may mislead readers about the number of divisions occurring in the proximal progenitor zone. This problem was addressed in our original manuscript by informing readers that the number of divisions in this zone is one or two (and this information is retained in our revised manuscript). Moreover, the term \u2018transit-amplifying cells\u2019 has been used throughout the vertebrate literature to refer to cells with similar properties to cells in the proximal progenitor zone. Does the confusion caused by \u2018amplifying\u2019 outweigh the confusion caused by adding a new term to the literature? We ask the reviewers to consider the pros and cons of the change in terminology and the need for a new term. Our preference is to use the term \u2018transit-amplifying cells\u2019, but we agree to replace it with \u2018transient progenitors\u2019 if the reviewers remain unconvinced."
