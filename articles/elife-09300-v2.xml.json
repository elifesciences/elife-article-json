However, the mechanisms by which receptors enable this concerted cellular response remain unclear. To investigate the effect of cellular tension on cell surface receptors, we combined novel high-resolution imaging and single particle tracking with established biochemical assays to examine TGF\u03b2 signaling. We find that TGF\u03b2 receptors are discretely organized to segregated spatial domains at the cell surface. Integrin-rich focal adhesions organize T\u03b2RII around T\u03b2RI, limiting the integration of T\u03b2RII while sequestering T\u03b2RI at these sites. Disruption of cellular tension leads to a collapse of this spatial organization and drives formation of heteromeric T\u03b2RI/T\u03b2RII complexes and Smad activation. This work details a novel mechanism by which cellular tension regulates TGF\u03b2 receptor organization, multimerization, and function, providing new insight into the mechanisms that integrate biochemical and physical cues."

However, the mechanisms by which receptors enable this concerted cellular response remain unclear. To investigate the effect of cellular tension on cell surface receptors, we combined novel high-resolution imaging and single particle tracking with established biochemical assays to examine TGF\u03b2 signaling. We find that TGF\u03b2 receptors are discretely organized to segregated spatial domains at the cell surface. Integrin-rich focal adhesions organize T\u03b2RII around T\u03b2RI, limiting the integration of T\u03b2RII while sequestering T\u03b2RI at these sites. Disruption of cellular tension leads to a collapse of this spatial organization and drives formation of heteromeric T\u03b2RI/T\u03b2RII complexes and Smad activation. This work details a novel mechanism by which cellular tension regulates TGF\u03b2 receptor organization, multimerization, and function, providing new insight into the mechanisms that integrate biochemical and physical cues."

Unlike T\u03b2RI, T\u03b2RII was often excluded from these sites and more commonly appeared to \u2018bounce\u2019 around the edges of individual focal adhesions.

Cells generate a coordinated response through interactions among signaling pathways \u2013 from ligands and receptors to intracellular effectors. Receptors are a particularly versatile locus of control since they undergo regulated microdomain clustering, internalization and homo/hetero-meric multimerization. Because these mechanisms affect ligand binding, enzymatic activity, and effector recruitment, receptors play a crucial role in defining signal intensity, duration, location, and quality (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bethani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Di Guglielmo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Groves and Kuriyan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Salaita et al., 2010</a>).

TGF\u03b2 signals through a heterotetrameric complex of transmembrane receptor kinases. Once the TGF\u03b2 ligand is activated from its latent form, it binds directly to a dimer of type II receptors (T\u03b2RII) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Annes, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Munger et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wipff et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Munger and Sheppard, 2011</a>). The ligand-bound T\u03b2RII complex recruits and phosphorylates two type I receptors (T\u03b2RI) \u2013 either Alk5 or Alk1 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wrana et al., 2008</a>). T\u03b2RI, in turn, phosphorylates and activates canonical Smad proteins and multiple non-canonical effectors, such as RhoA, TAK1 and Akt (<a href=\"#bib31\">Massague, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Feng and Derynck, 2005</a>). Specifically, recruitment of Alk5 to the T\u03b2RII complex stimulates phosphorylation of Smad2/3, whereas Alk1 recruitment drives activation of Smad1/5/8 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lin et al., 2008</a>). The inappropriate shift of T\u03b2RII multimerization partner from Alk5 to Alk1 underlies disease processes ranging from vascular disorders to osteoarthritis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blaney Davidson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Goumans, 2002</a>). Not only do TGF\u03b2 receptors associate with one another, but also with a number of other receptor families, notably integrins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Scaffidi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Garamszegi et al., 2010</a>). Garamszegi et al. revealed a physical interaction between integrin \u03b12\u03b21 and TGF\u03b2 receptors involved in collagen-induced Smad phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Garamszegi et al., 2010</a>).

Upon integrin binding to the extracellular matrix, the formation of focal adhesions stimulates actomyosin contractility to generate cellular tension (<a href=\"#bib11\">DuFort et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Giancotti, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ingber, 1997</a>). Through this Rho/ROCK-dependent mechanism, cells establish tensional homeostasis with the physical features of the extracellular environment (<a href=\"#bib11\">DuFort et al., 2011</a>).

In spite of the established tension-sensitive regulation of downstream signaling effectors, the effect of physical cues on growth factor receptor interactions is unknown. This gap in understanding is partly due to the fact that until recently, studies of cell surface receptor colocalization and physical interactions have mostly utilized biochemical, biophysical, or fluorescence imaging approaches. While invaluable, these approaches are limited by their inability to discriminate spatially discrete molecular interactions that occur in specific cellular domains. Novel super-resolution imaging approaches provide the capability to visualize receptor responses to biochemical and physical cues at the single molecule level with spatial and temporal specificity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coelho et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Manley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rossier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Calebiro et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Xia et al., 2013</a>). To elucidate mechanisms by which physical cues regulate growth factor signaling, we utilize high-resolution imaging, single particle tracking, mass spectrometry and biochemical assays to test the hypothesis that cellular tension regulates TGF\u03b2 receptor multimerization. We find that cellular tension controls the spatial organization, multimerization and activity of a discrete population of TGF\u03b2 receptors at integrin-rich focal adhesions, suggesting a novel mechanism by which physical cues calibrate the activity of the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway."

Single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (sptPALM) resolves the dynamics of individual molecules in live single cells. Using sptPALM, we captured thousands of trajectories of individual T\u03b2RI (Alk5) and T\u03b2RII proteins labeled with photoswitchable mEos2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">McKinney et al., 2009</a>). The large number of long duration molecular trajectories (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) allowed us to visualize single molecule track behavior and describe molecular environments within individual cells. For both T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII, individual receptors showed a range of mobility, resulting in groups of immobile, confined, or freely diffusive receptors (representative tracks, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Mobility of each group of T\u03b2RI did not differ significantly from T\u03b2RII (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), but the diffusion coefficient of T\u03b2RI was slightly higher (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), perhaps because of its lower molecular weight (T\u03b2RI/Alk5 56\u2009kDa vs. T\u03b2RII 65\u2009kDa). Relative to whole cell TGF\u03b2 receptor dynamics, T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII are significantly less mobile in cellular domains enriched with clusters of spatially organized receptors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Thus, this spatially organized population of TGF\u03b2 receptors is slower and more confined, possibly due to interactions with other proteins."

                                "text": "The distinct localization of TGF\u03b2 receptors could result from physical interactions with any number of known TGF\u03b2 receptor-associated proteins. Among these, integrins bind to T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII and functionally interact with the TGF\u03b2 pathway at multiple levels (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wrana et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Scaffidi et al., 2004</a>). The primary integrins in chondrocytes are integrins \u03b12 and \u03b1V, which bind collagen and vitronectin/fibronectin (<a href=\"#bib28\">Loeser, 2000</a>). Both integrins interact with the TGF\u03b2 pathway (<a href=\"#bib44\">Scaffidi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Garamszegi et al., 2010</a>). TIRF imaging of mCherry-labelled integrin \u03b12 revealed the presence of focal adhesions at these T\u03b2R-rich sites. Specifically, T\u03b2RII is absent from sites of adhesions and forms a peripheral ring surrounding integrin \u03b12, resulting in distinct patterns of spatial localization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Interestingly, this spatial organization is absent in cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated substrates that facilitate integrin-independent cell adhesion (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, T\u03b2RII organization at sites of adhesion is dependent upon integrin activity. Profile plots of intensity and a custom analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Ai,Bi,Ci</a>) were utilized to quantify colocalization between T\u03b2Rs and integrin \u03b12 across multiple cells. The slope of the regression line can be used as a metric, in which higher values indicate increased colocalization of two proteins. T\u03b2RI (Alk5 and Alk1) is precisely colocalized with integrin \u03b12 within focal adhesions, such that adhesions appear yellow (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>) and regression line slopes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Bi,Ci</a>) are higher relative to T\u03b2RII (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,Ai</a>). This analysis reveals that integrin \u03b12 colocalizes significantly more with Alk5 and Alk1 than with T\u03b2RII (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The specific localization of T\u03b2RII near focal adhesions is apparent in cells of both mesenchymal (ATDC5, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C,E</a>; Saos-2, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) and epithelial (MCF10A, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>) origin and is observed whether integrin \u03b12 or integrin \u03b1V is tagged with a fluorescent protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Furthermore, this observation still holds if the fluorescent labels for T\u03b2RII and integrin \u03b12 are switched, as well as if T\u03b2RII is expressed and imaged alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,H</a>). The overall spatial organization of TGF\u03b2 receptors at sites of adhesion is not affected upon stimulation with exogenous TGF\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>), suggesting that this spatiotemporal organization is regulated through mechanisms independent from TGF\u03b2 ligand addition. Given the critical role of integrins in mechanotransduction and the known sensitivity of TGF\u03b2 signaling to cellular tension (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2012</a>), the unique pattern of TGF\u03b2 receptor and integrin localization could prime TGF\u03b2 receptors for regulation by elements of the mechanotransduction pathway."

Trajectory maps reveal that T\u03b2RII mobility is confined near focal adhesions, which sequester and immobilize T\u03b2RI (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>). Indeed, a higher fraction of immobilized T\u03b2RI is present inside adhesions relative to outside (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Accordingly, the diffusion coefficient for T\u03b2RI decreases for tracks inside adhesions compared to those outside, demonstrating that this spatial organization specifically limits T\u03b2RI mobility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). The differential localization and dynamics of T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII in adhesion-rich domains, relative to one another and to the whole cell TGF\u03b2 receptor population, indicates that this spatial control has functional implications for TGF\u03b2 signaling and for mechanotransduction."

Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that precipitate with Flag-tagged T\u03b2RI (Alk5) and T\u03b2RII revealed hundreds of proteins, several of which were specifically enriched compared with precipitates of untransfected (mock) cells. The analysis identified proteins already known to interact with T\u03b2Rs, such as PRMT5 and PRMT1 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). T\u03b2Rs also precipitated several adhesion-related proteins, including integrin \u03b1V and endogenous cofilin, as shown in the annotated spectra (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). The peptide counts (graph insets) indicate that integrin \u03b1V associates with both T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII, and that cofilin preferentially associates with T\u03b2RII (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Cofilin is an actin-binding protein that severs ADP-actin filaments at the leading edge of migratory cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</a>). Previous reports implicate cofilin as a target of TGF\u03b2-activated RhoA, which promotes actin reorganization through ROCK, LIMK and cofilin (<a href=\"#bib48\">Vardouli et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lamouille et al., 2014</a>). However, this is the first report, to our knowledge, of a complex between TGF\u03b2 receptors and cofilin. To confirm these mass spectrometry findings, we performed co-immunoprecipitation on cells expressing Flag-tagged T\u03b2RI/II and tagged integrin \u03b1V or cofilin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Consistent with the mass spectrometry peptide counts, integrin \u03b1V forms a complex with both T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII, whereas cofilin primarily interacts with T\u03b2RII. Although the novel finding of a complex formation, either through direct or indirect interactions, between T\u03b2RII and cofilin remains to be further explored, it suggests a potential mechanism underlying the discrete spatial organization of T\u03b2RII at focal adhesions."

Release of this discrete spatial segregation of TGF\u03b2 receptors at focal adhesions allows the receptor subunits to interact such that ROCK-inhibition stimulates formation of heteromeric T\u03b2RI/T\u03b2RII complexes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

We observe a novel spatiotemporal regulation of the TGF\u03b2 pathway such that T\u03b2RII is segregated from T\u03b2RI and integrins at sites of adhesions. Single particle tracking reveals the dynamics of individual TGF\u03b2 receptor molecules, and identifies populations of TGF\u03b2 receptors with distinct behaviors and mobility near and far from sites of focal adhesions. The confined population of TGF\u03b2 receptors at focal adhesions has lower mobility than the freely diffusive receptor population far from sites of adhesion. TGF\u03b2 receptors associate with several adhesion-related proteins, including the actin-binding protein cofilin, which preferentially associates with T\u03b2RII relative to T\u03b2RI. This novel spatial organization of T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII at sites of adhesion provides mechanosensitive control of TGF\u03b2 receptor multimerization and function independently of TGF\u03b2 ligand stimulation. Overall, this reveals the potential of two differentially regulated populations of TGF\u03b2 receptors \u2013 one that is TGF\u03b2-sensitive and one that is tension-sensitive \u2013 a finding that may contribute to the context-dependent signaling outcomes of this pathway."

At the level of the TGF\u03b2 ligand, integrins activate TGF\u03b2 from its latent form through cellular tension generated by actomyosin contraction (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wipff et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Munger and Sheppard, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wells and Discher, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Giacomini et al., 2012</a>). The observed recruitment of TGF\u03b2 receptors to focal adhesions would enrich their access to this reservoir of integrin-activated TGF\u03b2. At the receptor level, focal adhesions may sequester T\u03b2RI from T\u03b2RII to limit their activity in the presence of ligand. The extent to which this sequestration is cofilin-dependent requires further investigation. This sequestration of T\u03b2RI may contribute to its slow internalization, relative to T\u03b2RII, following TGF\u03b2 stimulation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Vizan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ma et al., 2007</a>). Alternatively, focal adhesions may create structured T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII boundaries that prime a robust response when cells encounter the correct combination of physical and biochemical cues. We demonstrate tension-sensitive regulation of endogenous downstream Smad3 phosphorylation by cellular tension and TGF\u03b2. In addition, chondrocytes grown in TGF\u03b2 on 0.5 MPa substrates induce differentiation markers far beyond levels induced by either cue alone (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2012</a>). We and others have reported that the effect of substrate stiffness or cellular tension/Rho/ROCK activity on downstream TGF\u03b2 signaling is synergistic and nonlinear (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Leight et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, it is possible that lower cell tension in one cell type may have a differential effect on Smad phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and transactivation than in another cell type. It would be interesting to examine this effect utilizing a substrate system that provides independent and continuous gradients of ligand density and substrate stiffness (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rape et al., 2015</a>). The mechanisms responsible for such synergy have been unclear, but this newly described regulation of TGF\u03b2 receptor multimerization and downstream signaling may couple the mechanosensitive activity of the TGF\u03b2 pathway to physical cues. Fully understanding the functional implications of this spatially-distinct TGF\u03b2 receptor population will require the development of new imaging tools, such as those that can dynamically visualize TGF\u03b2 effector activity locally at focal adhesions."

Several receptor families share features with TGF\u03b2 receptors that may contribute to their mechanosensitivity, such as their association with integrin-rich focal adhesions and their potential for the formation of stable receptor clusters by geometric constraints (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bethani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Salaita et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hartman and Groves, 2011</a>). Previous studies have established important physical and functional links between focal adhesion components and growth factor receptors. EGF receptor binds actin and colocalizes with integrin \u03b12\u03b21 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alam et al., 2007</a>), while the receptor CD44 interacts with several components of the focal adhesion complex, such that hyaluronan-bound CD44 activates c-Src and Rac1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Turley et al., 2002</a>). Aside from TGF\u03b2, shown herein, the extent to which these physical associations contribute to mechanosensitive control of receptor multimerization or downstream signaling remains to be determined. Nonetheless, others have postulated receptor multimerization as a mechanism for mechanocoupling of TGF\u03b2, ephrin, and T cell receptor signaling (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hartman and Groves, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hynes, 2009</a>). In each case, the solid state presentation of the ligand is thought to play a critical role in structuring multimeric receptor clusters. In T cell receptor and ephrin signaling, the solid state is provided by ligands on the neighboring cell, which create geometric constraints that mechanically trap receptors to induce clustering (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bethani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Salaita et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hartman and Groves, 2011</a>). For growth factors like TGF\u03b2, BMP, and EGF, the ECM serves as the solid state (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hynes, 2009</a>). ECM proteins such as collagen II bind both TGF\u03b2 and integrin \u03b12\u03b21 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhu, 1999</a>), imposing geometric constraints that may structure receptor clusters. Therefore, growth factor receptor multimerization at focal adhesions, controlled by receptor interactions with integrins and with solid state growth factors, provide focal adhesions with the capability to integrate signaling between physical and biochemical cues."

                        "text": "Understanding the mechanosensitive regulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling has significant biological implications. We find that focal adhesions segregate T\u03b2RI from T\u03b2RII in both epithelial and mesenchymal cell lineages, opening the possibility that this is a general cellular mechanism for the control of TGF\u03b2 signaling. It will be interesting to determine if TGF\u03b2 receptor multimerization at focal adhesions responds to physical cues that aberrantly promote TGF\u03b2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer or the loss of chondrocyte homeostasis in osteoarthritis. On stiff substrates, TGF\u03b2 preferentially activates PI3K to induce EMT instead of apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leight et al., 2012</a>). In osteoarthritis, the material properties of the cartilage ECM deteriorate as chondrocytes inappropriately shift the balance from canonical (Alk5/Smad2/3) to non-canonical (Alk1/Smad1/5/8) T\u03b2RI signaling (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blaney Davidson et al., 2009</a>). In each case, the extent to which changing the physical environment alters TGF\u03b2 effector selection through differential TGF\u03b2 receptor multimerization remains to be determined. Applied physical cues, such as compression or shear flow, also regulate TGF\u03b2 signaling in cartilage, vasculature, and other tissues (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sakai et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Streuli, 1993</a>). Whether similar mechanisms operate in response to exogenous physical cues remains to be elucidated."

At focal adhesions, T\u03b2RII is uniquely segregated from its T\u03b2RI counterpart. Cellular tension modulates the spatial organization, multimerization, and downstream signaling of TGF\u03b2 receptors at sites of adhesion, suggesting the existence of a functionally distinct subpopulation of TGF\u03b2 receptors. Overall, this finding provides a new mechanism by which cellular tension and physical cues exert control of growth factor signaling at the cellular membrane."

Following LC-MS/MS analysis, peak lists generated from spectra were searched against the human subset of the SwissProt database using in-house ProteinProspector (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clauser et al., 1999</a>). For analysis, peptide counts of each protein were normalized by the total protein content in the sample and the molecular weight of the respective protein. This provided an abundance index for each protein that served as a comparison between pulldowns. The ratio between abundance indices for T\u03b2R pulldowns to untransfected control (mock) pulldowns was used to screen candidate proteins."

Cells expressing mEos2-tagged constructs were simultaneously activated with a 405 nm laser and excited with a 561 nm laser. Laser intensities were adjusted to maintain a constant sparse population of activated molecules that were spaced well enough for accurate localization and tracking. Prior to each sptPALM imaging sequence and photoconversion of mEos2, the mEmerald signal from mEmerald fusions of vinculin was imaged to localize focal adhesions. NIS-Elements software (Nikon) was used for the acquisition of images at 10 fps.

The similarity of the two profiles was quantified to provide a measure of colocalization, specifically by comparing pixel intensities (8-bit grayscale) at each point across the two profiles. For each pixel, an ordered pair containing the intensities at that particular coordinate from both images was plotted. Values closer to the line y=x refer to coordinates that have very similar intensities in both profiles. Values further from y=x are coordinates that have a mismatch in intensities. By reflecting all points in the top half of this graph across y=x, a distribution of points is created between y=x and the x-axis, but the distance of individual points from y=x is preserved. The magnitude of the slope of the regression line through these points can be used as a quantitative metric of colocalization. The greater this slope, the higher the degree of colocalization.

Cells were imaged with spinning disc confocal and TIRF microscopy (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). T\u03b2RII was excluded from integrin-rich focal adhesions in cells grown on collagen II-coated substrates. On the other hand, when grown on poly-l-lysine-coated substrates where binding does not require integrins, cells do not form adhesions and show no evidence of T\u03b2RII exclusion. We observed identical but less striking results when cells were plated on substrates coated with integrin inhibitory (4B4) antibodies (not shown). These findings indicate that integrin-mediated adhesion is required for the unique spatial organization of T\u03b2RII, and that this organization is maintained with high cellular tension."

First, with the reduction in cellular tension following ROCK inhibition, T\u03b2RI preferentially co-precipitates with its signaling partner T\u03b2RII (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Second, a reduction in cellular tension by culture of cells on compliant substrates also promotes co-precipitation of T\u03b2RI with T\u03b2RII (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Third, a reduction in cellular tension by culture of cells on compliant substrates drives Smad3 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, Allen et al., 2012). Finally, the tension-dependent changes in T\u03b2RI/T\u03b2RII multimerization and Smad3 phosphorylation correspond to changes in TGF\u03b2-inducible Smad nuclear translocation (not shown, Allen et al., 2012). Therefore, these data extend and further strengthen the conclusion that cellular tension controls the spatial organization and formation of active T\u03b2RI/T\u03b2RII complexes as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of the key TGF\u03b2 effector Smad3."

As the reviewers indicate, TIRF imaging on gels is extremely difficult because the refractive index is not matched to that of glass. Confocal imaging could not definitively discriminate the effect of cellular tension on T\u03b2R localization in cells grown on variable stiffness substrates (polyacrylamide or PDMS). We also manipulated cellular tension by varying the size, shape, and surface area of micropatterned adhesive substrates acquired from collaborators and from commercial sources. Although imaging revealed cellular adhesions on each of these substrates, the resolution was insufficient to determine the effect of cellular tension on T\u03b2R spatial organization. Significant additional technical and scientific effort, beyond the scope of the current project, is needed to successfully use TIRF to determine the effect of these micropatterns on TGF\u03b2 receptor localization."

Integrins \u03b12 and \u03b1V were chosen since they are primary integrins in chondrocytes, where they bind collagen and vitronectin/fibronectin, respectively. Furthermore, both of these integrins have been shown to interact with the TGF\u03b2 pathway. For example, integrin \u03b1V activates TGF\u03b2 ligand from its latent form through generation of cellular tension (Wipff et al., 2007), and integrin \u03b12\u03b21 physically associates with TGF\u03b2 receptors during collagen-induced Smad phosphorylation (Garamszegi et al., 2010; Introduction). It will be interesting to further expand these studies to examine other integrin members as well as other cell types in the future."

However, we were limited by the well-known lack of suitable reagents for immunofluorescent detection of endogenous T\u03b2RI or T\u03b2RII. Indeed, few published studies show T\u03b2R IF. Those that do are unable to achieve the resolution apparent in studies by our group and others that use fluorescently-tagged T\u03b2Rs (Ma et al., 2007). Our attempts to visualize endogenous T\u03b2Rs with two different T\u03b2RII antibodies and two different T\u03b2RI antibodies showed specificity relative to IgG controls and were comparable to published results (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; Garamszegi et al., 2010). Unfortunately, this bright punctate staining was inadequate to observe finer spatial organization. Furthermore, this approach is limited by the inability to perform dynamic imaging, which is essential for the fundamental understanding of these receptor-receptor interactions and their responses to physical or biological stimuli (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). In spite of the inability to visualize the spatial organization of endogenous T\u03b2Rs, the implication of endogenous Smad3 in tension-dependent regulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) gives confidence that these findings are physiologically relevant."

In addition to anticipated identification of co-expressed integrin \u03b1V, T\u03b2RII binds to endogenous cofilin, an actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin filaments and in cell motility. The peptide counts indicate that endogenous cofilin preferentially associates with T\u03b2RII relative to T\u03b2RI, a finding supported by co-IP assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Future studies will examine additional candidates that may contribute to this discrete spatial organization and explore the functional role of cofilin in the mechanoregulation of T\u03b2R heteromerization and function."

This evidence that cellular tension regulates the endogenous TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway complements our prior observations of stiffness-dependent regulation of endogenous TGF\u03b21 and chondrocyte marker gene expression, as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of endogenous Smad3 (Allen et al., 2012). These findings demonstrate the capacity for cellular tension to modulate the activity of the endogenous TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway."

These conditions correspond to TGF\u03b2-inducible Smad3 phosphorylation. This suggests that cellular tension can structurally prime TGF\u03b2 receptors to respond to the addition of TGF\u03b2, consistent with previous findings (Allen et al., 2012). Overall, these new data strengthen our finding of a novel mechanism by which cellular tension regulates the spatial organization and downstream signaling of TGF\u03b2."
