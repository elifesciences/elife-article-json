The main mode of interaction between these two parts is considered to be formed by the inhibitory control of the nuclei by cortical Purkinje neurons. We now amend this view by showing that inhibitory GABA-glycinergic neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CN) project profusely into the cerebellar cortex, where they make synaptic contacts on a GABAergic subpopulation of cerebellar Golgi cells. These spontaneously firing Golgi cells are inhibited by optogenetic activation of the inhibitory nucleo-cortical fibers both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the CN may contribute to the functional recruitment of the cerebellar cortex by decreasing Golgi cell inhibition onto granule cells."

The main mode of interaction between these two parts is considered to be formed by the inhibitory control of the nuclei by cortical Purkinje neurons. We now amend this view by showing that inhibitory GABA-glycinergic neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CN) project profusely into the cerebellar cortex, where they make synaptic contacts on a GABAergic subpopulation of cerebellar Golgi cells. These spontaneously firing Golgi cells are inhibited by optogenetic activation of the inhibitory nucleo-cortical fibers both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the CN may contribute to the functional recruitment of the cerebellar cortex by decreasing Golgi cell inhibition onto granule cells."

They do this under the supervision of the cortex. The main interaction between the cortex and the nuclei involves cortical neurons called Purkinje cells inhibiting the activity of the nuclei."

This approach reveals that the axons of these neurons \u2018climb\u2019 from the nuclei to the cortex to form a new circuit called the inhibitory nucleo-cortical (iNC) pathway. Moreover, activating the iNC axons with light reveals that they selectively target and silence a population of neurons called the Golgi cells, which control the transmission of information in the cerebellar cortex."

The next challenge is to explore how the iNC pathway fine-tunes how sensory inputs are processed in the cerebellum, and to better understand its role in the execution of complex movements, including in people with conditions that affect motor function, such as ataxias."

Current cerebellar theories (<a href=\"#bib5\">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Jacobson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Dean and Porrill, 2011</a>) mainly discuss cerebellar computation from the point of view of its cortical circuitry, where both pre-cerebellar mossy fibers (MFs) and inferior olive (IO)-originating climbing fibers (CFs) modulate Purkinje neuron (PN) spiking. Sensory-motor signal processing in the main cerebellar output structure, the cerebellar nuclei (CN), has received less attention. Modulation of spike frequency and timing in the CN projection neurons is considered to be mostly determined by the massive inhibitory cortico-nuclear projection of PNs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chan-Palay, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">De Zeeuw and Berrebi, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Telgkamp and Raman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pedroarena and Schwarz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Telgkamp et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Person and Raman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Najac and Raman, 2015</a>). However, certain aspects of cerebellar function persist even when the cerebellar cortex is selectively inactivated or damaged (<a href=\"#bib82\">Thompson and Steinmetz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Aoki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Clopath et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Longley and Yeo, 2014</a>). Thus, a better understanding of the information processing in the CN as well as its influence on cerebellar cortical computation is needed."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A1,B1</a>, these procedures resulted in the expression of the fluorophores (mCherry in GAD-cre and YFP in GlyT2-cre mice) in a subset of CN neurons. In the GAD-cre mice, the labeled neurons displayed a wide range of sizes and shapes, including both globular and multipolar morphologies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A2</a>, arrow and arrowhead, respectively).

To examine the morphological difference between CN cells labeled in GAD-cre and GlyT2-cre mice, we measured and compared their soma sizes. The size distribution in GAD-cre CN was best fitted with a two-component Gaussian model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, red bars and line; Gaussian peaks at 11.9 \u00b5m and 16.2 \u00b5m; R-square 0.97, n = 650 cells in 6 animals), suggesting it is composed of two separate populations.

This indicates that they differ both in shape and location from the excitatory MFs and the glutamatergic nucleo-cortical fibers described earlier in the literature, both forming rosette-like terminals within the glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib86\">Tolbert et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">H\u00e1mori et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Batini et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Houck and Person, 2015</a>)."

First, we performed voltage-clamp whole-cell recordings from Golgi cells surrounded by transfected iNC fibers in GlyT2-cre mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, right panel). With the use of small collimated beams of light (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we stimulated locations near Golgi cell dendrites with a single, short (5 ms) pulses. Inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) were evoked in 9 out of 38 recorded Golgi cells (23.7%; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C1</a>) with a mean amplitude of 40 \u00b1 28 pA. Given the ionic composition of our experimental solutions, the estimated reversal potential of \u221274 mV with the permeabilities of bicarbonate and chloride taken into account and the holding potential of \u221250 mV, the chord synaptic conductance was 1.7 \u00b1 1.2 nS and the slope conductance was 1.9 \u00b1 1.3 nS according to the Goldman\u2013Hodgkin\u2013Katz (GHK) equation. We calculated that the equivalent peak conductance of the iNC synapse measured in symmetrical chloride conditions would have been of 8.5 \u00b1 5.9 nS. The light-evoked IPSCs had a 10\u201390% rise time of 2.5 \u00b1 1.3 ms and a bi-exponential decay (\u03c41 = 8.2 \u00b1 1.9 ms, 52.3 \u00b1 18.3%; \u03c42 = 34.8 \u00b1 9.2 ms, n = 9 cells). Application of strychnine at a concentration selective for glycine receptors (300 nM) decreased the amplitude of the IPSC by 24 \u00b1 25% (p = 0.039, n = 9 cells) without affecting the time course of the IPSCs (rise time: 2.4 \u00b1 0.9 ms; decay: \u03c41 = 9.2 \u00b1 3.0 ms, 52.5 \u00b1 23.5%, \u03c42 = 40.6 \u00b1 21.2 ms; p = 0.91, p = 0.65 and p = 1.00 respectively, n = 9 cells). These results confirm the presence of a glycinergic component at the iNC-Golgi cell synapses albeit with large variability in its magnitude (range: 0\u201363%; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C2</a>, left). Subsequent application of a GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor antagonist (gabazine, 2 \u00b5M), almost completely blocked the response, decreasing the amplitude of the IPSC by 96.5 \u00b1 2.9% (p = 0.0078, n = 8 cells; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C1,2</a>).

When evaluating iNC effects in Golgi cells, it became obvious that only the spontaneously active Golgi cells (\u2018s-Golgi cells\u2019) were responsive to iNC stimulation.

Repeating these stimulations during depolarizing current injections that drove the ns-Golgi cells to continuous spiking also failed to reveal iNC effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, top right). These findings suggested that iNC fibers inhibit preferentially s-Golgi cells. It should be noted that our virus injections were unlikely to result in transfection of the entire iNC population, hence the observed fraction of inhibited s-Golgi cells is bound to be underestimated."

Compared to the s-Golgi cells, the ns-Golgi cells showed significantly larger variability in all of the AP shape measurements, although no significant differences were found in their average values (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Also, no differences were found in population averages of the input\u2013output relationship of the two Golgi cell groups, as evidenced by nearly identical current-to-firing frequency (I-F) curves (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). ns- and s-Golgi cells did not differ as a population in their estimated capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>)<sub>,</sub> nor in their input resistance, but analysis of their variance showed clear differences between the groups (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, compare the significance values obtained with Wilcoxon and F-tests in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

It is well established that Golgi cells are neurochemically heterogeneous (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ottersen et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Simat et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Pietrajtis and Dieudonn\u00e9, 2013</a>). While the majority of Golgi cells express the glycine transporter GlyT2, with most of them being of mixed GABA-glycinergic phenotype, about 15\u201320 % of Golgi cells are purely GABAergic (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ottersen et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Simat et al., 2007</a>). GlyT2-expressing Golgi cells have previously been reported to be intrinsically silent (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dugu\u00e9 et al., 2009</a>). We, thus, hypothesized that the iNC-inhibited Golgi cells, all of which fire spontaneously, may correspond to the purely GABAergic Golgi cells. As all of the Golgi cells that express the calcium-binding protein, neurogranin are also GABAergic (<a href=\"#bib75\">Simat et al., 2007</a>), we used neurogranin in conjunction with GlyT2-eGFP expression to differentiate pure GABAergic Golgi cells from the mixed GABA-glycinergic and pure glycinergic Golgi cell populations (<a href=\"#bib75\">Simat et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Pietrajtis and Dieudonn\u00e9, 2013</a>)."

The CN of the offspring carrying both transgenes were injected with a floxed AAV expressing the red fluorescent protein tdTomato. Cerebellar cortical sections from these mice were then stained for neurogranin to differentiate between the Golgi cells subtypes. iNC axons were easily identified by their co-expression of eGFP and tdTomato and were found to preferentially contact cell bodies and dendrites of Golgi cells that were intensely stained for neurogranin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). This selective targeting of neurogranin-positive cells by iNC fibers extended to the ML (indicated by arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), as iNC fibers were seen to climb along the apical dendritic shafts of neurogranin-positive Golgi cells to the ML. Similarly, in GAD-cre animals, iNC fibers transfected with YFP and co-stained for GAD65-67 were found to impinge on the dendrites and cell bodies of Golgi cells strongly expressing neurogranin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, arrowheads)."

At saturating illumination intensity (1.3 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), stereotypical high-frequency bursts of spikes were evoked with short light durations (10 ms), resembling the extracellular recordings in the GlyT2-cre slices. These bursts were riding on a depolarized plateau, which outlasted the illumination period, and were often followed by a prolonged depolarized after-potential and low-frequency firing. Increasing the duration of the light pulse extended the burst duration without affecting the intra-burst frequency (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B2</a>).

Based on our in vitro calibration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), single 25-ms long light pulses are expected to evoke short bursts of firing in the iNC neurons.

The rest of the Golgi cells (79%, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C2</a>, middle) as well as PNs (n = 50 cells, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C2</a>, right) did not show any significant modulation of the spiking frequency following illumination. The time course of the inhibition in the responsive Golgi cells was variable (duration: 23.4 \u00b1 11.7 ms; onset latency: 14.5 \u00b1 7.2 ms; peak latency: 25.4 \u00b1 14.1 ms; n = 18, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D2</a>) as exemplified with colored traces from individual cells in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D1</a>. The variability of the inhibitory effect can be explained by the variability in iNC spike-burst duration that depends on the distance from the optic fiber and thereby stimulation light intensity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Regardless of this variability, Golgi cells\u2019 firing was robustly suppressed (frequency decreased to 1.58 \u00b1 1.46 Hz from a baseline of 10.9 \u00b1 3.9 Hz, n = 18 cells, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D3</a>).

Therefore, iNC fibers undoubtedly represent the axons of a single mixed CN neuron type. The density of nucleo-cortical fibers in the GAD-cre model was somewhat higher than in the GlyT2-cre model (compare panels 2A1 and 2B1), most likely due to the mosaic expression of cre in only 50% of mixed neurons in the GlyT2-cre mice (<a href=\"#bib48\">Husson et al., 2014</a>) as well as the stronger expression levels obtained with the AAV9 serotype virus used in the GAD-cre model."

The iNC synapses on the eNC neurons constitute only of a tiny fraction of their synaptic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib48\">Husson et al., 2014</a>), but we cannot completely exclude that some facet of the iNC-mediated depression of Golgi cell spiking in vivo may reflect a decrease in excitatory synaptic drive from CN-originating MFs.

Such an arrangement could partly explain the synchronization of Golgi cell activity observed along the axis of the lobules (<a href=\"#bib93\">Vos et al., 1999</a>). Furthermore, disinhibition of GrCs by iNC axons could enhance and synchronize MF-PF transmission specifically along medio-lateral stripes, possibly contributing to on-beam synchronization of PNs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Heck and Thach, 2007</a>). iNC neurons may thus implement refined temporal binding of parasagittal cerebellar modules within a lobule.

Small craniotomies were performed above the CN. The target regions were mostly in the lateral and interpositus nuclei, and the injections were performed unilaterally for immunohistochemical and anatomical protocols, and bilaterally for electrophysiological experiments. A quartz capillary pipette (35- to 40-\u00b5m tip diameter) was positioned in the brain at the proper coordinates for CN (1.8\u20132.2 mm lateral from midline, 3.2\u20133.4 mm deep, 6.0\u20136.2 mm from Bregma), and small amount (50\u2013300 nl for electrophysiological experiments, 50\u2013100 nl for immunohistochemical protocols) of viral suspension (summarized in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) was slowly pressure-injected either by a hand-held syringe or using a Picospritzer II (General Valve Corporation). In some experiments, additional virus (either non-specific or cre-dependent GFP reporter) was injected in several locations in the cerebellar cortex or into the IO. After the entire volume was injected, pipettes were held at the same position for 10 to 15 min and were then carefully and slowly removed from the tissue, in order to avoid backflow of the viral suspension and unwanted contamination in the cerebellar cortex along the pipette tracts. Animals were closely monitored for 3 days until recovery from surgery and then housed for at least 3 to 4 weeks before being used in experiments, as described below.

During experiments, the GAD-cre slices were perfused with room temperature Solution 1 (25\u201328 \u00b0C; flow rate 3 ml/min), and the GlyT2-cre slices were perfused with Solution 4 at physiological temperature (33\u00b0C; flow rate 3.5 ml/min).

Statistical analysis was performed using R GNU and MATLAB R2009b or R2012b. Data are presented in the text as mean \u00b1 S.D, unless otherwise specified. For statistical significance, Wilcoxon rank-sum, two-tailed Student's t-test (paired or unpaired), F-test, K-S test, and signed-rank tests were used, as applicable, taking into account possible assumptions of normality as mentioned in the results. Spike delay analysis was performed by aligning the last spikes before light stimulation in each trace for each cell and measuring the time to the next spike after light stimulation; the measurements were normalized to the cell's average ISI. For comparing electrophysiological properties of different types of Golgi cells, grand average AP waveforms were generated for each cell by averaging peak-aligned APs obtained during 1-s voltage sweeps while adjusting the firing frequency to \u223c25 Hz with current injection as necessary, and then by averaging these peak-aligned mean waveforms across experiments. C<sub>m</sub> was defined as the ratio of membrane resistance (R<sub>m</sub>) and time constant (\u03c4), estimated from voltage responses (&lt;5 mV) to small hyperpolarizing current steps that did not activate voltage-gated conductances (evidenced by the good single-exponential fits to the voltage responses). AP threshold was defined as the voltage at the time of the main peak in the second derivative of the voltage trace; AP amplitude was measured as the voltage difference between the spike threshold and peak voltage. Spike half-width was measured spike duration at half-amplitude. Spike AHP voltage was measured at the post-spike minimum voltage. AHP time was measured as the time of AHP voltage after threshold, and AHP amplitude was measured as the difference of the AHP voltage and spike threshold voltage. For fair comparison of current-to-firing frequency ratios in different sized cells, the current injection values were normalized to the C<sub>m</sub> of each cell. Spike frequency adaptation index was quantified as the relative decrease in instantaneous firing frequency during a 1-s long depolarizing current step (from \u221265 mV holding level) during which the mean firing frequency was \u223c25 Hz. In the pharmacological voltage-clamp experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), the responses were recorded after at least 6 min from the beginning of the perfusion of the drug into the recording chamber to provide the time for the steady-state effect. Time-locking of spikes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was quantified as the decrease in the normalized V<sub>m</sub> variability between subsequent stimulation trials. Decrease in variability, as an index of spike-time locking, was considered statistically significant at the level of 3*SD (see also <a href=\"#bib73\">Schneider et al., 2014</a>)."

Commercial tetrodes embedded in a quartz tube (Thomas Recording, Giessen, Germany), gold-plated to reach a 100\u2013200 k\u03a9 impedance, were lowered into the CN. Signals were referenced against a tungsten electrode positioned in saline at the surface of the cerebellar cortex. The light was delivered immediately above the CN via an optical fiber (diameter 200-\u03bcm core) connected to CrystaLaser at 473 nm and inserted in a cannula placed above the injection sites in the CN (see \u2018Stereotaxic injections\u2019 paragraph for coordinates). 25- to 50-ms light pulses (45 mW) were delivered at 4 Hz in 3-s bouts separated by 7-s recovery periods; post hoc inspection showed no indication of decreased inhibition during the 3-s bouts, suggesting that these stimulation parameters did not induce cumulative ChR2 inactivation. Signals were acquired using a custom-made headstage and amplifier and a custom-written LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, TX) allowing real-time monitoring of cellular activity. To isolate spikes, continuous wide-band extracellular recordings were filtered off-line with a Butterworth 1 kHz high-pass filter. Spikes were then extracted by thresholding the filtered trace and the main parameters of their waveform extracted (width and amplitude on the 4 channels). The data were hand-clustered by polygon-cutting in 2-dimensional projections of the parameter space using Xclust (Matt Wilson, MIT). The quality of clustering was evaluated by inspecting the auto-correlograms of the units (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gao et al., 2011</a>). Golgi cells and Purkinje cells were identified according to most recently published criteria (<a href=\"#bib91\">Van Dijck et al., 2013</a>). These criteria provide a simple approach to classify cerebellar units using only a few statistical parameters describing the firing frequency and irregularity of discharge: the mean spike frequency (MSF), the coefficient of variation of the log of the ISI (LCV), and entropy of the ISIs (ENT). We used the boundary values on these parameters defined by <a href=\"#bib91\">Van Dijck et al. (2013)</a> to identify Golgi cells (MSF&lt;20 Hz, 0.5"

The entire brain was then dissected and post-fixated (3 hr for immunohistochemistry, overnight for anatomical examination) in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C before rinsing in PBS. For anatomical confocal imaging, 80-\u00b5m sections were cut with a Leica 1000 TS vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), placed on objective glass, mounted with Immu-Mount (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and coverslipped with #1.5 glass. For immunohistochemistry experiments, the brains were cryoprotected by equilibration in 30% sucrose wt/vol PBS at 4\u00b0C and then cut at \u221220\u00b0C with a Leica CM3050S cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Free-floating 80-\u00b5m thick parasagittal sections were rinsed in PBS and permeabilized 2 hr at room temperature in 0.4% vol/vol Triton 100-X (Sigma) in PBS. Non-specific sites were saturated by incubation in 0.4% Triton 100-X\u20141.5% cold fish skin gelatin (Sigma) in PBS at room temperature for 3 hr.

Confocal stacks for anatomical visualizations were acquired with Leica SP5 microscope using 40\u00d7 (NA 1.25) and 63\u00d7 (NA 1.5) oil-immersion objectives, with 8- or 12-bit color depth, and with 0.1 \u03bcm z-step. The images were acquired for mCherry, EYFP, and GFP fluorescence with excitation lasers and emission filters set to: 561 DPSS laser, 587\u2013655 nm; 488 argon laser, 520\u2013580 nm; GFP, 500\u2013550 nm. Wide-view images (in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A1,B1</a>) were composed by merging tiles of confocal stacks (with 10% overlap and 1 \u03bcm z-step). The grayscale background images in 2A1 and B1 were obtained from autofluorescence signals acquired at the same time as the specific fluorescence signals. Morphological features (NC cell body sizes, iNC axonal bouton sizes) were measured using the Fiji image analysis software (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>). The soma sizes are given as the major length axis; for axon bouton sizes, as the area of the cross section of each bouton in maximal projection image. To quantify neurogranin and GlyT2-eGFP staining intensities at Golgi cell bodies, z-stacks containing the somata were projected and averaged (z-projection thickness: 6.8 \u00b5m). Intensities for each channel were normalized according to the slope of the fit to the logarithmic distribution of their pixel intensity before being retrieved and the ratios were calculated. As the neuropil in cerebellar granule layer is densely labeled in the GlyT2-eGFP mice preventing backtracking individual distal dendrites to their somata in order to attribute them a ratio value, the iNC varicosities in the granular cell layer were included in the statistics only when contacting proximal dendrites and cell bodies. Using GNU R, K-means 2D clustering was performed on mean GlyT2-eGFP vs mean neurogranin data set to cluster the GoC subpopulation."

The main finding is that a specific subpopulation of GlyT2+/GAD+ neurons located in the cerebellar nuclei, innervate a distinct subpopulation of Golgi cells. The axons of the CN neurons co-release GABA and Glycine and can either pause or drive the firing of the Golgi cells. Both mixed GABAergic/Glycinergic and pure GABAergic Golgi cells are targeted by the feedback projection, while pure glycinergic Golgi cells are not."

Thus, a significant proportion of the neurons classified as pure glycinergic could be mixed. While it is possible that these neurons match 3% of \u201cpure glycinergic\u201d neurons contacted by iCN projections, based on the Simat estimates, the proportion should be higher than 3%. Moreover, the ratio of Neurogranin/eGFP-GlyT2 is rather an indirect way of assessing the identity of a cell given the level of fluorescence is influenced by many experimental parameters. Indeed, the cells expressing Neurogranin at 2x higher levels than the level of GlyT2-eGFP, which are classified as GlyT2 negative, could still secrete a substantial amount of Glycine.

Thus it could be conceivable that inhibition of spiking in these excitatory CN neurons would result in decrease in Golgi cell spiking. However, the glutamatergic projection neurons are extremely strong pacemakers and resistant to even the massive, tonic PN inhibition (Person &amp; Raman, Nature 2012; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The iNC inhibition of these cells is however expected to be significantly weaker than the PN-originating inhibition. Thus, while in principle possible, it seems unlikely that the short burst of iNC IPSPs on glutamatergic CN neurons would reduce the excitatory drive to Golgi cell to result in the observed pauses in Golgi cell spiking in vivo.

The term \u201cassociated\u201d used to link Neurogranin expression with GABAergic neurons is somewhat misleading. In the Simat paper, some mixed neurons do not express Neurogranin (type 2 and 3, respectively 3-5% and 10%), although they release GABA (GAD67+). Thus, a significant proportion of the neurons classified as pure glycinergic could be mixed. While it is possible that these neurons match 3% of \u201cpure glycinergic\u201d neurons contacted by iCN projections, based on the Simat estimates, the proportion should be higher than 3%. Moreover, the ratio of Neurogranin/eGFP-GlyT2 is rather an indirect way of assessing the identity of a cell given the level of fluorescence is influenced by many experimental parameters. Indeed, the cells expressing Neurogranin at 2x higher levels than the level of GlyT2-eGFP, which are classified as GlyT2 negative, could still secrete a substantial amount of Glycine. This makes the conclusion that \u201cthese results demonstrate that iNC fibres contact almost exclusively the purely GABAergic Golgi cells\u201d uncertain.

Regarding Golgi cell subtypes as described by <a href=\"#bib75\">Simat et al. (2007)</a>, it should be noted that all neurogranin-positive Golgi cells express GAD67 (while the opposite is not true). Thus, the statement that neurogranin is \u201cassociated\u201d with GAD expression is in our opinion fully justified. The neurogranin-positive cells that carry 97% of detected iNC contacts can therefore belong to either the purely GABAergic neurons (Simat\u2019s type 4, 15% of all cells) or the mixed GABA-glycinergic Golgi cells (Type 1, 65%). The remaining 3% of iNC axons could contact either Simat\u2019s types 2, 3 or 5. Notably, we cannot distinguish between these \u201cSimat\u201d classes in our method."

Instead we are showing preferential targeting of cells residing on the extreme end of a continuum. The Golgi cell population can be divided into at least two groups as attested by the bimodal distribution of GFP expression. The larger cluster (labeled green in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E, F, G, I</a>) of cells displays strong GFP expression while the second cluster (blue) displays low to background levels of GFP expression. All the cells which are strongly contacted by iNC axons (i.e., have more than 1-4 contacts) fall in the second cluster of low-GFP neurons. Importantly, the most strongly contacted cells in this group (labeled with darker reds in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>) have relatively high neurogranin expression.
