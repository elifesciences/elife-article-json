Here we evaluate the participation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic neurons in two forms of experience-dependent modification of primary visual cortex (V1) in adult mice: ocular dominance (OD) plasticity resulting from monocular deprivation and stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP) resulting from enriched visual experience. These two forms of plasticity are triggered by different events but lead to a similar increase in visual cortical response. Both also require the NMDA class of glutamate receptor (NMDAR). However, we find that PV+ inhibitory neurons in V1 play a critical role in the expression of SRP and its behavioral correlate of familiarity recognition, but not in the expression of OD plasticity. Furthermore, NMDARs expressed within PV+ cells, reversibly inhibited by the psychotomimetic drug ketamine, play a critical role in SRP, but not in the induction or expression of adult OD plasticity."

Here we evaluate the participation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic neurons in two forms of experience-dependent modification of primary visual cortex (V1) in adult mice: ocular dominance (OD) plasticity resulting from monocular deprivation and stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP) resulting from enriched visual experience. These two forms of plasticity are triggered by different events but lead to a similar increase in visual cortical response. Both also require the NMDA class of glutamate receptor (NMDAR). However, we find that PV+ inhibitory neurons in V1 play a critical role in the expression of SRP and its behavioral correlate of familiarity recognition, but not in the expression of OD plasticity. Furthermore, NMDARs expressed within PV+ cells, reversibly inhibited by the psychotomimetic drug ketamine, play a critical role in SRP, but not in the induction or expression of adult OD plasticity."

Mouse visual cortex has proven to be an excellent model system in which to examine experience-dependent neural response modification. One robust type of visual response plasticity is reliably elicited in adult (&gt;\u00a0P60) mice by simply closing one eyelid. Over the course of 5\u20137 days of monocular deprivation (MD), the responses in visual cortex evoked by stimulation of the non-deprived eye progressively increase (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sawtell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>). This deprivation-enabled response potentiation is driven by visual experience through the non-deprived eye, as only the responses through one eye are potentiated (<i>i.e.</i>, it is input specific) and it fails to occur if both eyelids are closed or if the animals are kept in a dark room (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blais et al., 2008</a>). There is evidence that the response potentiation is mediated in part by \u201cHebbian\u201d strengthening of excitatory synaptic transmission in visual cortex, as induction requires cortical NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sawtell et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>) and \u03b1-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (\u03b1CAMKII) expression in principal cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ranson et al., 2012</a>). This form of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity is likely responsible for the increase in visual acuity that occurs through the non-deprived eye following adult monocular deprivation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Iny et al., 2006</a>), and is of particular interest in the context of recovery of brain function after deprivation, disease, or damage (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cho and Bear, 2010</a>)."

Brief daily presentation of a phase-reversing grating of a single orientation causes a large and persistent increase in the peak cortical response to this orientation, as measured by visual evoked potentials (VEPs) or unit recordings (<a href=\"#bib19\">Frenkel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cooke et al., 2015</a>). This phenomenon is termed stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP) because only responses to the experienced orientation are increased. Abundant evidence suggests that SRP is also mediated by \u201cHebbian\u201d mechanisms, particularly those revealed by the study of long-term synaptic potentiation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cooke and Bear, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">2014</a>). The mechanisms utilized for SRP within V1 have also been shown to mediate a fundamental form of long-term visual recognition memory, manifested behaviorally as orientation-selective habituation (OSH) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cooke and Bear, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cooke et al., 2015</a>)."

Thus, it came as a surprise that response potentiation after monocular deprivation and SRP do not occlude one another (<a href=\"#bib18\">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</a>), suggesting that they employ different mechanisms or are expressed by different synapses. We became interested in the possibility of differential involvement of cortical inhibition mediated by the parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) fast spiking neurons. PV+ fast-spiking inhibitory neurons comprise the most numerous sub-class of GABAergic cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib52\">Xu et al., 2010</a>) and receive substantial feed-forward glutamatergic input from the thalamus (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cruikshank et al., 2007</a>). These interneurons synapse preferentially on the somata and initial axon segments of principal cells, and therefore are in a position to strongly and precisely modulate even short latency visually evoked responses (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cristo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Markram et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</a>). Moreover, previous studies have suggested that fast-spiking interneurons participate in the expression of cortical eye dominance and OD plasticity in juvenile mice (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yazaki-Sugiyama et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Smith and Bear, 2010</a>). The contribution of this class of neuron to cortical plasticity is also of particular interest given the evidence for cortical PV+ neuron dysfunction in various psychiatric disorders characterized by impaired cognitive function (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gogolla et al., 2009</a>)."

We find that neither the pharmacogenetic silencing of PV+ cells nor the specific deletion of NMDARs within them affect the relative eye dominance or the expression of deprivation-enabled potentiation of VEPs in adult mice. In contrast, and quite unexpectedly, we discovered that the expression of SRP is dependent on PV+ cell activity, and that perturbations of PV+ neuron function, most notably cell-type specific ablation of NMDARs, disrupt the expression of both SRP and its behavioral correlate, familiarity recognition."

The binding of CNO to the hM4D(Gi) receptor activates intracellular G<sub>i</sub>-mediated signaling and subsequent hyperpolarization of the cell in which the receptors are expressed. We locally expressed hM4D(Gi) receptors in PV+ cells of binocular V1 using an adeno-associated viral vector containing a construct for Cre-selective expression (AAV9-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine) in mice that express Cre recombinase only in PV+ cells (B6;129P2-<i>Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup></i>/J, PV-Cre). We confirmed the selective expression of hM4D(Gi) receptors in PV+ neurons in binocular V1 using immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E</a>). In order to ensure that PV+ neurons could be inactivated by this method, we took slices of V1 for ex vivo intracellular recordings. Bath application of CNO drastically inhibited current evoked action potential firing of PV+ neurons in Layer 4 (2-way repeated measures ANOVA, interaction of CNO x current injection, F<sub>(8,72)</sub> = 6.227, P &lt; 0.001, n = 10 cells, significant at data points above 100pA: q(8) = 3.716, P = 0.014) but had no effect on neighboring non-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). Layer 4 recordings in vivo demonstrated that systemic administration of CNO resulted in the elevation of visually-evoked potential (VEP) magnitude, and an increase in the firing rate of excitatory single units (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H\u2013I</a>), which are expected consequences of inactivating PV+ inhibitory neurons in binocular V1."

The selectivity of the potentiation to a familiar stimulus can be summarized by plotting the ratio of VEP magnitudes driven by familiar and novel stimuli (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

However, to address the possibility that a \u201cceiling effect\u201d contributes to the disruption of SRP expression during PV+ cell inactivation, we conducted an additional experiment in which mice viewed sinusoidal grating stimuli across a range of contrast values (5, 10, 25, 50, 100%).

If orientation selectivity were completely abolished by inactivation of PV+ neurons then the loss of SRP expression could be attributed to a failure of orientation discrimination rather than familiarity. A previous experiment has indicated that activation of PV+ neurons in V1 actually mildly enhances orientation-selectivity and visual discrimination (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, we used optogenetics to activate PV+ neurons while mice were presented with familiar and novel stimuli to test whether SRP expression would be enhanced, unaffected or disrupted. PV+ neurons in binocular V1 of PV-Cre mice expressed Channel-rhodopsin 2 (ChR2) as a result of infection with AAV5-EF1\u03b1-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP. During the same surgery VEP recording electrodes were implanted and optic fibers chronically implanted to deliver light to the recording site (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). After stable expression 4 weeks after infection, mice were habituated to head-fixation on each of 2 days before undergoing a standard SRP experiment over 6 days (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Mice showed a significant increase in the magnitude of the average VEP evoked by the familiar oriented grating stimulus over days (Friedman repeated measures ANOVA on ranks, n = 11 mice, X<sup>2</sup><sub>(5)</sub>= 24.818, P &lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

On day 7, mice were presented with interleaved blocks of familiar and novel stimuli. Also interleaved were blocks of familiar and novel stimuli in which blue light (473 nm) was continuously delivered via the optic fiber to the recording site in binocular V1. VEPs elicited by the novel X + 90\u00b0 stimulus were significantly lower in magnitude (221.34 \u00b1 33.55 \u00b5V) than those elicited by the familiar stimulus prior to optogenetic activation of PV+ neurons (310.70 \u00b1 36.70 \u00b5V, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA, n = 11 mice, SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(10)</sub> = 11.799, P &lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Optogenetic activation of PV+ neurons significantly diminished the selectivity of SRP, as VEPs elicited by the familiar stimulus (181.23 \u00b1 26.43 \u00b5V) and novel stimulus (157.80 \u00b1 21.05 \u00b5V) were more similar in magnitude (interaction of stimulus x laser, F<sub>(1,10)</sub> = 46.606, P &lt; 0.001; familiar vs. novel SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(10)</sub> = 3.094, P = 0.045, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

Laser stimulation did not affect the stimulus selectivity of SRP in wild type animals infected with virus (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), as there was no significant interaction between stimulus and laser (2-way repeated measures ANOVA, F<sub>(1,8)</sub> = 0.677, P = 0.434). These mice underwent SRP (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and on test day showed significantly larger VEPs to the familiar stimulus, both with the laser off (familiar VEP: 273.69 \u00b1 28.25 \u00b5V, novel VEP: 200.19 \u00b1 19.53 \u00b5V, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA, n = 9 mice, SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(8)</sub> = 5.234, P = 0.005) and the laser on (familiar VEP: 277.08 \u00b1 29.80 \u00b5V, novel VEP: 194 \u00b1 18.39 \u00b5V, q<sub>(8)</sub> = 5.916, P = 0.002, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, SRP expression was disrupted with activation of PV+ neurons, just as it was with inactivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013E</a>). This result implies that PV+ neurons play a specific role in SRP expression beyond any role in enhancing orientation tuning."

Given the additional clear requirement for normal PV+ inhibitory cell function in SRP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>) we selectively ablated the NMDAR from just PV+ cells by crossing the PV-Cre line of mice with a line in which the mandatory GluN1 subunit of NMDAR is excised by Cre recombinase activity (B6.129S4-<i>Grin1<sup>tm2Stl</sup></i>/J, GluN1 fl/fl). The progeny of this cross, in which both alleles of Grin1 (the gene encoding GluN1) were floxed, are henceforth described as either PV-GluN1 KO or Wildtype (WT)-GluN1 fl/fl depending on whether, respectively, Cre was expressed or not. We implanted PV-GluN1 KO (n = 14) and littermate WT-GluN1 fl/fl mice (n = 17) with VEP recording electrodes in layer 4, binocular V1. After recovery and 2 daily sessions of habituation we recorded VEPs elicited by an X<sup>o</sup> oriented grating stimulus. Immediately apparent was the significantly greater basal magnitude of VEPs recorded in the PV-GluN1 mice (242.45 \u00b1 20.20 \u00b5V) relative to their littermate controls (130.88 \u00b1 9.69 \u00b5V, student\u2019s two-tailed t-test, t<sub>(29)</sub> = -5.269, P &lt; 0.001), consistent with the occurrence of disinhibition as a result of reduced glutamatergic drive on cortical PV+ inhibitory cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We then presented the same stimulus to these mice over several consecutive days and observed a significant difference in SRP across genotypes (2-way repeated measures ANOVA, interaction of genotype x day, F<sub>(4,116)</sub> = 3.835, P = 0.006, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Beyond day 3, VEP magnitudes were no longer significantly different between the PV-GluN1 KO mice (289.15 \u00b1 24.57 \u00b5V) and WT-GluN1 fl/fl littermates (239.94 \u00b1 20.72 \u00b5V, SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(29)</sub> = 2.242, P = 0.119), suggesting an occlusion of SRP by the already elevated basal VEP magnitude in the PV-GluN1 KO mice. The significant deficit in SRP is clearly apparent when the data are normalized to day 1 values (2-way repeated measures ANOVA, interaction of genotype x day, F<sub>(4,116)</sub> = 12.326, P &lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Again, a significant deficit in SRP emerged by day 3 in the PV-GluN1 KO mice (119.26 \u00b1 10.13% day 1) compared with WT-GluN1 fl/fl littermates (183.33 \u00b1 15.83% day 1, SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(29)</sub> = 4.727, P = 0.002), demonstrating that SRP is compromised by a loss of NMDAR expressed in PV+ neurons."

In these same PV GluN1 KO mice, SRP was also significantly impacted as there is was significantly less gain in magnitude over days of repeated presentation of an X\u00b0 stimulus than observed in WT littermates. (<b>B</b>) This significant reduction in the magnitude of SRP was most clearly observed if VEP magnitude was normalized to the magnitude on day 1.

However, consistent with the observed difference in magnitude on day 1, VEPs elicited by a novel X + 90\u00b0 stimulus in PV GluN1 KO mice were significantly greater in magnitude than those in WT littermate mice. No significant difference was observed for VEPs elicited by the familiar stimulus.

After habituation to head-fixation and a gray screen for 2 days, SRP was induced over 4 days by repeatedly presenting sessions of an X\u00b0 stimulus. On day 5, SRP expression was tested by presenting interleaved blocks of the familiar X\u00b0 stimulus and a novel X + 60\u00b0 stimulus. In order to test the acute impact of blocking NMDA receptors on SRP expression, 50 mg/kg of ketamine was then delivered systemically 15 min before re-acquiring VEPs elicited by the familiar X\u00b0 stimulus and interleaved presentations of a second novel X - 60\u00b0 stimulus. Mice were then allowed 2 days recovery and a complete washout of ketamine before re-testing SRP expression by again testing VEP magnitude in response to the familiar X\u00b0 stimulus and a third novel X + 90\u00b0 stimulus on day 7. (<b>B</b>) Significant SRP was expressed on experimental day 5 prior to ketamine delivery as the familiar X\u00b0 stimulus elicited VEPs of greater magnitude than the novel stimulus. Delivery of 50 mg/kg ketamine (purple) had two notable impacts on the VEP: First, the overall magnitude of the VEP increased. Second, and most importantly, the significant difference in magnitude of VEPs elicited by familiar and novel stimuli was no longer present. This effect was acute, as SRP expression was again significantly apparent 2 days later. (<b>C</b>) The ratio of VEP magnitude elicited by the familiar stimulus over the novel. This ratio was close to 2 and not significantly different prior to or after recovery from ketamine administration but dropped significantly to approximately 1 during ketamine exposure. (<b>D</b>) We tested whether ketamine had a differential impact on VEP magnitude in PV GluN1 KO mice and WT littermate mice. (<b>E</b>) In the WT littermate mice (white bars) 50 mg/kg ketamine had a significant potentiating effect on VEP magnitude, consistent with our previous observation. In contrast, ketamine had no significant impact on VEP magnitude in the PV GluN1 KO mice (gray bars). (<b>F</b>) The selectivity of ketamine\u2019s impact on the WT mice is observed by comparing the ratio of VEP magnitude during ketamine over baseline, which was significantly greater for WT mice than the PV GluN1 KO mice, in which the ratio was approximately 1. (<b>G</b>) In a separate group of mice, a similar protocol was then used to determine whether the OD ratio is affected by ketamine. (<b>H</b>) Ketamine impacted both the VEPs driven through the contralateral eye (blue) and ipsilateral eye (yellow) equally. (<b>I</b>) This scaled effect is demonstrated by a lack of significant difference between OD ratios prior to (white) and during 50 mg/kg ketamine (purple). (<b>J</b>) We next tested whether ketamine has any impact on the expression of adult OD plasticity by recording VEP magnitudes through either eye in a new group of adult mice before taking them through a standard 7 day MD protocol. (<b>K</b>) As anticipated, 7 days of contralateral eye MD induced a significant ipsilateral eye potentiation (yellow) and ketamine then further potentiated VEPs elicited through both contralateral (blue) and ipsilateral eyes. (<b>L</b>) The OD ratio shifts significantly from a ratio heavily biased towards the contralateral eye, to a\u00a0less biased ratio. Ketamine administration did not significantly affect the magnitude of the OD shift.

Thus, while ketamine prevents SRP expression through action on NMDAR expressed in PV+ cells, it does not significantly affect the adult OD shift after 7 days of MD, consistent once again with PV+ cells contributing to the expression of SRP but not adult OD plasticity."

Head-restrained mice viewing a phase reversing visual grating stimulus are known to exhibit a stereotyped motor response called a visually-induced fidget, or vidget (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cooke et al., 2015</a>). Vidgets can be measured via a piezoelectric sensor located beneath the forepaws of the mouse (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Importantly, it has been shown that the magnitude of the vidget response is inversely correlated to the familiarity of the visual stimulus. That is, a visual stimulus that is very familiar to the animal will on average evoke a relatively weak vidget behavioral response. In contrast, the presentation of a novel stimulus will on average evoke a vidget of significantly greater magnitude. Therefore, this behavioral response reflects the ability of the animal to discriminate and respond to a novel visual stimulus in its environment. Importantly, genetic and pharmacological manipulations local to V1 that inhibit SRP also disrupt the behavioral discrimination of familiar and novel stimuli (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cooke et al., 2015</a>), demonstrating that this differential vidget response to familiar and novel stimuli is dependent on the plasticity in visual cortex. Since PV+ neuron inactivation disrupted the expression of SRP, we tested whether this manipulation would likewise disrupt visual novelty detection."

On the 7th day mice viewed blocks of the now familiar visual stimulus interleaved with blocks of a novel oriented stimulus (X + 60\u00b0).

These include modulation of the sensitivity of visual cortex to the effects of MD (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fagiolini et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hanover et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004</a>) and the functional expression of the OD shift (<a href=\"#bib35\">Maffei et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yazaki-Sugiyama et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Smith and Bear, 2010</a>). Our findings indicate that expression of OD plasticity in adult mice does not require participation of the PV+ neurons. In interpreting the current findings, it is important to recognize how juvenile and adult OD plasticity differ. In juvenile mice (&lt;\u00a0~P35), a rapid and reliable consequence of MD is depression in cortex of responses mediated by the deprived eye. This is followed by a progressive compensatory increase in responses through the non-deprived eye (<a href=\"#bib18\">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</a>). In adult mice maintained under standard laboratory conditions, depression of deprived-eye responses can be a weak and variable consequence of MD, but potentiation of the non-deprived eye still occurs reliably (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sawtell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>). This deprivation-enabled response potentiation is not mediated by homeostatic synaptic scaling because it requires visual experience through the non-deprived eye (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blais et al., 2008</a>), activation of cortical NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sawtell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sato and Stryker, 2008</a>), and is unaffected (in adults) by genetic deletion of TNF\u03b1 that abolishes scaling (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ranson et al., 2012</a>). These features are consistent with an alternative hypothesis that the adult OD shift occurs because deprivation of the dominant contralateral eye causes a metaplastic shift in the LTP threshold, enabling visual experience through the weaker ipsilateral eye to drive \u201cHebbian\u201d synaptic strengthening (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cooper and Bear, 2012</a>). This interpretation is supported by evidence that light deprivation promotes LTP in visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kirkwood et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Philpot et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">2003</a>) and that \u03b1CaMKII mutants that lack LTP also lack adult OD plasticity (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ranson et al., 2012</a>), and it is compatible with our finding that expression of the adult OD shift is not dependent on the activity of PV+ inhibitory neurons."

They then tested the dependence of this shift on PV+ cell activity by measuring ODI values of V1 neurons during optogenetic suppression of PV+ cells. This optogenetic-suppression did not alter the deprivation-induced shift in ODI values. Our results using VEP recordings and PV+ suppression via hM4Di Dreadd receptors are in agreement with these results from Saiepour and colleagues, demonstrating that suppression of PV+ cell activity after deprivation does not interfere with the expression of the adult OD shift. Although the findings that PV+ neurons are not necessary for expression of OD plasticity do not rule out a modulatory role in the induction mechanisms, we note that the adult OD shift still occurred in mutant mice in which PV+ neurons lack NMDARs."

This finding came as a surprise, as SRP reflects the potentiation of short-latency synaptic currents and increased spiking activity in layer 4 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cooke et al., 2015</a>), and previous experiments had strongly indicated that SRP might be considered a naturally occurring form of LTP. For example, induction of SRP is input-specific, dependent upon NMDA receptor activation and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) insertion in principal cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Frenkel et al., 2006</a>), and reversed by infusion of the zeta-inhibitory peptide (ZIP) that also erases LTP (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cooke and Bear, 2010</a>). Furthermore, LTP elicited by theta-burst stimulation of the thalamus occludes and is occluded by SRP (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cooke and Bear, 2010</a>). Altogether, these findings suggest a modification of feed-forward excitatory synaptic transmission."

The first is that the loss of discrimination of familiar and novel orientations could be accounted for simply by a failure of orientation selectivity and not by a failure of memory. Throughout the experiments presented here we have used orientations that are at least 60\u00b0 and often 90\u00b0 different, meaning that orientation discrimination should be as unchallenging as possible. Given the modest impact on orientation tuning of suppressing PV+ interneuron activity in V1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Runyan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adesnik et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>) we believe that this explanation is improbable. However, we took a direct approach to testing this possibility by stimulating activity in PV+ cells using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) while mice are viewing familiar and novel oriented stimuli. Stimulation of PV+ inhibition has been shown to actually mildly enhance orientation-selectivity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2012</a>) and yet our experiments reveal that the difference between visual cortical response to familiar and novel orientations is significantly diminished by activation PV+ neurons. This result casts PV+ neurons in a very specific role in the recognition of familiar stimuli in addition to modest participation in orientation-selectivity."

However, we show that the cortex responds to input from the contralateral eye with a response of approximately double the magnitude of that elicited by input through the ipsilateral eye even after silencing the PV+ cells, suggesting that the response of the cortex is not saturated. We also find that PV+ neuron silencing affects SRP even when it is induced using lower contrast stimuli that evoke submaximal responses. Moreover, it is also worth noting that less specific pharmacological approaches to suppressing inhibition in V1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Khibnik et al., 2010</a>) result in much greater magnitude of response to visual input than we observe here for PV+ neuron inactivation, PV-GluN1 KO or ketamine application, indicating that our manipulations do not encroach on a physiological ceiling."

                                "text": "One relatively simple explanation for the current findings is that SRP results from lasting homosynaptic (<i>i.e.</i> input-specific) long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic input to PV+ inhibitory neurons. Thereafter, presentation of a familiar stimulus evokes a greater response in V1 due to selective disinhibition of cortical circuitry. This hypothesis is consistent with our observation that SRP is deficient if NMDARs are no longer expressed on PV+ cells. However, because we used a non-reversible genetic modification in our initial PV-GluN1 KO experiment, we were initially unable to show if these receptors were important for the storage of information or the retrieval of information already stored. Ketamine, which among other actions serves as a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist, has been shown to preferentially antagonize NMDARs on PV+ cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Homayoun and Moghaddam, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Seamans, 2008</a>). By using ketamine to induce a temporary blockade of these receptors, which we confirmed by showing that there was no impact of ketamine on V1 responses in the PV-GluN1 KO mice, we were able to demonstrate that interference with NMDARs on PV+ cells disrupts <i>expression</i> of SRP even after it has been induced and saturated. Importantly, acute application of ketamine did not affect the maintenance or stability of stored information, because a strong bias for the familiar stimulus returned after ketamine washout. If SRP is indeed accounted for by homosynaptic depression of excitatory synapses carrying information about the familiar stimulus orientation, this LTD would need to be expressed by a synapse-specific reduction in NMDAR-mediated responses in order to account for these findings."

Considered together, the findings to date indicate that induction and maintenance of SRP occur by modification of excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons, but that expression of SRP is mediated by stimulus-selective modulation of PV-cell activity in V1. Obviously a polysynaptic circuit is required to yield these properties, and dissecting this essential cortical circuitry will require much more work. However, it is interesting to note a recent study by Makino and Komiyama who showed, in addition to a stimulus-selective reduction in PV+ neuron activity in V1 as mice were repeatedly exposed to a specific visual stimulus, an experience-dependent increase in the responsiveness of somatostatin-positive interneurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</a>). This result is particularly interesting as it is known that many interneuron types innervate one another and, therefore, that the activity of these cell types are interdependent. It is not difficult to sketch circuits in which stimulus-selective, feed-forward polysynaptic inhibition of PV+ cells accounts for SRP expression. Clearly, experiments aimed at teasing apart the involvement of other interneuron types in SRP should now be a high priority."

For instance, Meyer and colleagues, studying infero-temporal cortex (IT) in monkeys, showed that familiarity resulted in a sharpening of cortical responses to dynamic visual stimuli, which was likely orchestrated by local fast-spiking putative PV+ cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Meyer et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, mice constitutively lacking neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin (NARP), a synaptic protein specifically enriched at excitatory synapses on PV+ cells, displayed a reduction in excitatory synapses onto PV+ cells and impairment in SRP-like effects (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gu et al., 2013</a>). Intriguingly, however, the NARP KO mice also failed to exhibit both juvenile and adult OD plasticity. In juvenile animals, it is well established that reducing inhibition can impair induction of OD plasticity (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ramoa et al., 1988</a>) and delay the developmental decline in the mechanism of deprived-eye depression (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hanover et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 1999</a>). We speculate that the loss of OD plasticity in the adult NARP KO may be related to disruption of the developmental switch from juvenile to adult-type OD plasticity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Heimel et al., 2011</a>)."

However, further work will be necessary to confirm that open eye potentiation in the adult animal is expressed by synaptic alterations between excitatory cells, and to determine whether these processes are present at the level of thalamocortical synapses or intracortical synapses."

We have shown here that modulation of PV+ neuron activity in V1 is required for this selective recognition of familiarity and consequent novelty detection. Loss of NMDAR function in these same cells also impairs familiarity recognition. The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and other psychiatric disorders, are characterized by deficits in habituation and familiarity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Braff et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ramaswami, 2014</a>) and individuals with schizophrenia display impairment in visual cortical plasticity (<a href=\"#bib5\">\u00c7avu\u015f et al., 2012</a>). Dysfunction of PV+ inhibitory neurons and the NMDARs expressed on PV+ cells have also been implicated in these same psychiatric disorders through a range of approaches (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gogolla et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lewis et al., 2011</a>).

Before stimulus presentation on each day mice also underwent 5\u2009min of gray screen presentation after the experimenter had left the room. A continuous voltage signal was recorded from the piezo device for the entire session. Movements were detected as a shift in the voltage signal. The recording system was automated so that no one was ever present in the closed room for any of the recording period and white noise was played at 67 dB in order to mask outside noise."

The period of interest in the experiments described here lasted from 2 s prior to stimulus onset until 5 s after stimulus onset (which was the first 10 phase reversals in a block). Quantification of movement driven by the onset of the stimulus (the vidget) was calculated by taking the Root Mean Square (SQRT(X<sup>2</sup>)) of the voltage signal. Post-stimulus signal was then normalized to the average magnitude during the 2-s period prior to stimulus onset. The average normalized magnitude across the 5-s period subsequent to stimulus presentation was then used to quantify the degree of stimulus-driven movement and this is described throughout in arbitrary units (a.u.)."

Normality of distribution and homogeneity of variation was tested and parametric ANOVAs (for multiple groups) or t-tests (for 2 groups) were performed when data passed these tests. Otherwise, non-parametric ANOVAs or t-tests on ranks were used. If ANOVAs yielded significance, Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc tests with adjustment for multiple comparisons were applied for individual comparisons. Repeated measures ANOVAs or paired t-tests were applied for all within subject comparisons. For other comparisons unpaired ANOVAs or t-tests were used. Individual tests used are described in the results. P &lt; 0.05 is used as a threshold for significance throughout but exact P values are given for all comparisons for which the P value is above 0.001. Post-hoc power analyses were used to determine that comparisons reached a power of &gt; 0.8 for an alpha value of 0.05. Technical replicates were only used as N for the ex vivo electrophysiological test of hM4D(Gi) efficacy, when 10 cells were recorded from 7 mice, and the test of NMDAR functional loss in PV-GluN1 KO mice, when 8 cells were recorded from 5 mice. Throughout the remainder of the study we report the N is an individual animal (biological replicate). Technical replicates (secondary samples within each animal) were not undertaken for in vivo electrophysiology. Although both hemispheres were implanted initially, a decision was made as to the best hemisphere, based on response magnitude, morphology and binocularity after the very first recording (prior to any measure of plasticity). Technical replicates were undertaken for the behavior, with 10, 6 (for PV-HM4D(Gi) experiments) or 5 stimulus onsets (for PV-GluN1 KO experiment) being delivered per day, although we only report the daily average (biological replicate). There variations in protocol were due experiments being conducted by different experimenters at different times. However, protocols were completely consistent across treatments/genotypes. The individual technical replicates are available in the uploaded source data files."

We thank the reviewers for highlighting our lack of clarity on this issue. The purpose of our application of ketamine in the PV-GluN1 knockout was to demonstrate that, in specific regard to increases in the magnitude of the VEP, the selective loss of NMDAR function in PV+ cells was sufficient to completely abolish the impact of ketamine, which is the result that we show in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7E</a> and F. A range of other physiological consequences of ketamine may well be unimpaired by loss of NMDAR function selectively in PV+ cells but are not the focus of investigation in this particular study. We note that the effect of ketamine to significantly increase VEP magnitude in wild-type mice is paradoxical because a glutamate receptor blocker might be expected to reduce excitatory transmission in the brain. This finding is, however, consistent with other observations that the drug reduces cortical inhibition and therefore increases cortical excitation by acting preferentially (but by no means exclusively) on GABAergic fast-spiking cells in the cortex through NMDAR (Houmayoun 2007; and reviewed by Seamans 2008)."

In order to address this question directly, we conducted fluorescence-guided intracellular recordings from ex vivo slices if V1 to confirm the loss of NMDAR-mediated currents in PV+ cells from the PV-GluN1 KO mice. As expected, recordings from PV+ interneurons in V1 revealed a lack of any significant NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), while showing normal AMPAR-mediated EPSCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Conversely, neighboring principal cells displayed both NMDAR and AMPAR-mediated EPSCs. The selective loss of NMDAR EPSCs in PV+ neurons in the PV-GluN1 KO mice is reflected by plotting the NMDAR/AMPAR EPSC ratio in PV+ cells as well as neighboring principal cells. Thus, PV+ neurons sampled from V1 in the PV-GluN1 knockout mice failed to express NMDA receptors. This data has been added to the manuscript as <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>."

As a result of our confirmation that NMDAR-mediated currents are completely absent from at least all sampled PV+ cells in the PV-GluN1 KO mice, we hypothesize that the residual potentiation in the PV-GluN1 may derive from some form of developmental compensation that could occur through another subclass of neuron or another receptor type. Acute manipulation of NMDARs via ketamine would not allow for such compensation to occur, and therefore could explain the complete abolishment of SRP expression in the ketamine experiment that was not apparent in the PV-GluN1 knockout. It is possible that in SRP, NMDARs may be involved not only on PV+ cells but also on principal cells (Frenkel 2006). In this case, the effect of ketamine on NMDARs expressed on principal cells may also contribute to the complete lack of SRP expression in these experiments (even if it cannot account for the action of ketamine on VEP magnitude), in comparison to the PV-GluN1 KO mouse experiments. In order to test this hypothesis, future studies will probe the involvement of NMDARs on principal cells in various cortical layers in SRP. The alternative explanation, that another class of receptor compensates for the loss of NMDAR in the PV-GluN1 KO is also worthy of further investigation."

Multi-unit recordings from Layer 4 of wild-type animals showed that peak firing rate in response to a familiar stimulus was significantly elevated compared to those evoked by a novel stimulus (Cooke et al., 2015). In response to a phase reversing visual stimulus, the negative-going component of the VEP occurs simultaneously with a short latency spiking response to the visual stimulus. Familiar stimuli drive larger VEPs and increased neural spiking in Layer 4 in comparison to novel stimuli. By using laminar probes that span the cortical layers, we have also explored how familiarity changes the laminar flow of current sinks and sources and using current source density analysis (Cooke et al., 2015). From this we have observed alterations across multiple V1 layers resulting from experience, but the most striking effects are apparent in the short-latency layer 4 current sink, where familiar stimuli drive a larger current sink and increase the spiking of L4 neurons. Our current findings indicate that this increased spiking in L4 in part derives from removal of inhibition mediated by PV+ neurons."

Previously published data has also revealed that although there is evidence for thalamocortical (TC) LTP-like phenomena as a mechanism underlying SRP (Frenkel et al., 2006, Cooke and Bear 2010), selectivity for familiar and novel stimuli cannot be fully explained by changes occurring at the TC synapse in Layer 4. Isolation of the TC synaptic response by silencing intra-cortical spiking revealed a loss of SRP expression, suggesting that although changes may be occurring at the level of the TC synapse, downstream intra-cortical network alterations are involved (Cooke and Bear, 2014). We propose that these LTP-like changes previously reported are critical in the induction and maintenance of the stored information related to the familiar stimulus. Alterations in PV+ cell activity are necessary, however, for the retrieval/expression of this information. Since the major focus of this paper was on the expression mechanisms of SRP, the role of PV+ cells in the induction process remains unknown but we plan to pursue this further. A discussion of this hypothesis and how it differs from adult OD plasticity is presented in the revised Discussion section of the manuscript."

More importantly, we have reported that behavioral responses do not occur on all stimulus presentations and for the 5 stimulus onsets (gray to phase reversing grating) that occur on each recording day, only a subset will produce a behavioral response. However, the VEPs evoked during each of these stimulus blocks are similar in magnitude, regardless of whether a behavioral response has occurred or not and the difference in cortical response between familiar and novel stimuli is maintained even for all of those stimulus blocks where no behavior occurred. Thus, the behavior itself does not account in any way for VEP magnitude or the phenomenon of SRP."

It is heart-warming to us that these two studies, using different recording methods, have arrived at the same conclusion in regards to the expression mechanisms involved in adult OD plasticity, which only adds to the striking contrast with SRP expression mechanisms that we describe in our manuscript. We now devote a considerably larger portion of our Discussion section to this important study and its implications."
