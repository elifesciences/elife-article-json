                    "text": "Armor plate changes in sticklebacks are a classic example of repeated adaptive evolution. Previous studies identified <i>ectodysplasin (EDA)</i> gene as the major locus controlling recurrent plate loss in freshwater fish, though the causative DNA alterations were not known. Here we show that freshwater <i>EDA</i> alleles have <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory changes that reduce expression in developing plates and spines. An identical T \u2192 G base pair change is found in <i>EDA</i> enhancers of divergent low-plated fish. Recreation of the T \u2192 G change in a marine enhancer strongly reduces expression in posterior armor plates. Bead implantation and cell culture experiments show that Wnt signaling strongly activates the marine <i>EDA</i> enhancer, and the freshwater T \u2192 G change reduces Wnt responsiveness. Thus parallel evolution of low-plated sticklebacks has occurred through a shared DNA regulatory change, which reduces the sensitivity of an <i>EDA</i> enhancer to Wnt signaling, and alters expression in developing armor plates while preserving expression in other tissues."

Previous studies have identified characteristic base pair positions that differentiate the most abundant <i>EDA</i> haplotypes present in marine and freshwater populations. The position of these SNPs in the <i>EDA</i> region are shown, along with the exon number in which they occur, the nature of the mutation (S: synonymous change; N: non-synonymous change; Reg: regulatory change), the SNP number assigned in previous studies, and the characteristic alleles that are found in 10 different completely-plated marine (red) and 14 different low-plated freshwater (blue) populations (top two haplotype rows, see <a href=\"#bib14\">Colosimo et al., 2005</a>). We amplified the genomic region surrounding the new T \u2192 G regulatory mutation identified in the current study, and found that 12 of 263 completely plated migratory fish from Rabbit Slough, Alaska (RABS) were heterozygous for the T \u2192 G change (minor allele frequency: 2.3%). Analysis of flanking positions suggests that these carrier fish are heterozygous for larger or smaller haplotypes at the <i>EDA</i> locus, or are marine-like at all positions except for the T \u2192 G change like NAKA. The six indicated SNPs correspond to positions chrIV: 12808303, 12808630, 12811481, 12811933, 12813328, 12813394 in the stickleback genome assembly (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jones et al., 2012</a>).",

Previous studies identified <i>ectodysplasin (EDA)</i> gene as the major locus controlling recurrent plate loss in freshwater fish, though the causative DNA alterations were not known. Here we show that freshwater <i>EDA</i> alleles have <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory changes that reduce expression in developing plates and spines. An identical T \u2192 G base pair change is found in <i>EDA</i> enhancers of divergent low-plated fish. Recreation of the T \u2192 G change in a marine enhancer strongly reduces expression in posterior armor plates. Bead implantation and cell culture experiments show that Wnt signaling strongly activates the marine <i>EDA</i> enhancer, and the freshwater T \u2192 G change reduces Wnt responsiveness. Thus parallel evolution of low-plated sticklebacks has occurred through a shared DNA regulatory change, which reduces the sensitivity of an <i>EDA</i> enhancer to Wnt signaling, and alters expression in developing armor plates while preserving expression in other tissues."

Previous studies have identified characteristic base pair positions that differentiate the most abundant <i>EDA</i> haplotypes present in marine and freshwater populations. The position of these SNPs in the <i>EDA</i> region are shown, along with the exon number in which they occur, the nature of the mutation (S: synonymous change; N: non-synonymous change; Reg: regulatory change), the SNP number assigned in previous studies, and the characteristic alleles that are found in 10 different completely-plated marine (red) and 14 different low-plated freshwater (blue) populations (top two haplotype rows, see <a href=\"#bib14\">Colosimo et al., 2005</a>). We amplified the genomic region surrounding the new T \u2192 G regulatory mutation identified in the current study, and found that 12 of 263 completely plated migratory fish from Rabbit Slough, Alaska (RABS) were heterozygous for the T \u2192 G change (minor allele frequency: 2.3%). Analysis of flanking positions suggests that these carrier fish are heterozygous for larger or smaller haplotypes at the <i>EDA</i> locus, or are marine-like at all positions except for the T \u2192 G change like NAKA. The six indicated SNPs correspond to positions chrIV: 12808303, 12808630, 12811481, 12811933, 12813328, 12813394 in the stickleback genome assembly (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jones et al., 2012</a>).",

The threespine stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>) is a particularly favorable species to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying repeated evolution of adaptive phenotypic traits in nature, because many populations have evolved similar morphological and skeletal traits following widespread colonization of new freshwater environments by migratory marine ancestors at the end of the last ice age (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bell and Foster, 1994</a>)."

In contrast, freshwater fish characteristically lack most plates, typically retaining only 0\u20137 plates in the anterior flank region. This dramatic difference in anterior-posterior patterning of armor plates was used to assign different species names to marine and freshwater sticklebacks in the 1800s (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1829</a>). Subsequent studies have shown that different armor patterns are highly heritable, and are likely controlled by a relatively simple genetic system (<a href=\"#bib52\">M\u00fcnzing, 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hagen and Gilbertson, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Avise, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Ziuganov, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Banbura, 1994</a>).

However, the four amino acid changes occur at positions that also vary among other species, so these coding changes are unlikely to be the basis of major changes in EDA function. In addition, there exists at least one low-plated stickleback population that has the identical EDA protein-coding sequence as marine fish (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colosimo et al., 2005</a>). This key population from Nakagawa Creek in Gifu, Japan (NAKA) is a low-plated stream population with a predominately marine-like sequence in both coding and non-coding regions. NAKA fails to complement armor plate changes when crossed with a typical Canadian low-plated population (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schluter et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that NAKA and other low-plated fish share a modification in the same major locus. Based on the absence of amino acid changes in NAKA, and the deleterious nature of coding region changes in human patients, <a href=\"#bib14\">Colosimo et al.

We then isolated RNA from 10 different developing tissues, and determined whether the freshwater and marine <i>EDA</i> transcripts were expressed at the same or different levels using pyrosequencing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). No significant expression differences between marine and freshwater <i>EDA</i> alleles were observed in the fins or the lower jaw.

In addition, we have now identified a specific enhancer region in the key armor plates region, shown that the marine version of this enhancer normally drives expression in developing armor plates, and identified a specific T \u2192 G base pair change within the enhancer that is shared by all sequenced low-plated freshwater fish.

Mutations in the coding region of <i>EDA</i> in both zebrafish and medaka cause deleterious phenotypes at multiple body sites, including complete loss of scales, partial loss of fins and teeth, and multiple craniofacial abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib30\">Harris et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Iida et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, the T \u2192 G regulatory change we have identified in an <i>EDA</i> enhancer leads to partial loss of <i>EDA</i> expression, particularly in the posterior flank region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This regulatory change thus alters <i>EDA</i> expression at the same body site where freshwater fish lack body armor, while preserving important functions of <i>EDA</i> in other tissues. These results provide a new example of a specific regulatory change linked to morphological evolution in natural populations (<a href=\"#bib46\">Martin and Orgogozo, 2013</a>), and add to growing evidence that regulatory changes are a predominant mechanism underlying adaptive evolution in sticklebacks (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jones et al., 2012</a>) and other organisms (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wray, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carroll, 2008</a>)."

Thus, <i>EDA</i> has become a classic example of rapid parallel evolution based on a preexisting genetic variant that increases in frequency when marine populations colonize new freshwater environments (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stern, 2013</a>). The current results suggest that repeated evolution of low-plated phenotypes might also result from independent mutations occurring in the <i>EDA</i> locus in different populations. In previous surveys, Japanese NAKA fish were the only low-plated freshwater population that did not share the same <i>EDA</i> haplotype as other freshwater populations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colosimo et al., 2005</a>). Our experiments show that NAKA and other freshwater sticklebacks share an identical T \u2192 G non-coding regulatory mutation that reduces expression of <i>EDA</i> specifically in developing posterior armor plates. Characteristic flanking SNPs are not shared between NAKA and other low-plated populations, suggesting that the same T \u2192 G mutation has likely occurred independently on two very different haplotypes."

Individual base pairs can also be prone to particular mutations. For example, C \u2192 T transition mutations are particularly common at CpG dinucleotides in mammalian genomes, due to a high rate of spontaneous deamination of methylated C residues (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mancini et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xia et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, the recurrent regulatory mutation we have identified at the stickleback <i>EDA</i> locus is a T \u2192 G transversion substitution, one of the least common types of changes seen in large scale studies of spontaneous germ-line mutations in humans (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Genome of the Netherlands Consortium, 2014</a>) as well as in flies, worms, and yeast (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lynch, 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "It is possible that the shared T \u2192 G change arose not by independent mutation, but by extensive recombination or gene conversion from the typical freshwater <i>EDA</i> haplotype. Migratory marine populations include rare individuals that are heterozygous for both marine and freshwater haplotypes, which likely arise by repeated rounds of introgression of freshwater alleles into marine populations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colosimo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Schluter and Conte, 2009</a>). Sequence studies suggest that recombination can occur between typical marine and freshwater haplotypes, producing smaller and smaller blocks of sequence shared among most low-plated populations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colosimo et al., 2005</a>). In previous studies, the minimal shared freshwater region was approximately 16 kb, consisting of regions of both the <i>EDA</i> gene and two flanking genes involved in immune functions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colosimo et al., 2005</a>). However further recombination between marine and freshwater haplotypes could narrow this region further, conceivably approaching the size of a single base pair. For example, we have recently surveyed 263 migratory marine sticklebacks from Alaska and identified 12 completely plated individuals that are heterozygous for the T \u2192 G change in the <i>EDA</i> enhancer (minor allele frequency 2.3%). Analysis of flanking SNPs suggests one of these carriers is heterozygous for a larger characteristic freshwater haplotype, three are heterozygous for a much shorter freshwater haplotype, and eight are heterozygous at the T \u2192 G position but are marine-like at other characteristic flanking SNPs tested (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). These data show that migratory marine populations can carry freshwater haplotypes of different sizes, including much smaller regions surrounding the key T \u2192 G regulatory change. Although most low-plated populations have clearly fixed a multi-kilobase haplotype surrounding <i>EDA</i>, the large size of this haplotype may reflect co-selection for additional phenotypes controlled by the closely linked genes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colosimo et al., 2005</a>). The geographically distant NAKA population is low-plated but shares only the T \u2192 G change, either because of an independent mutation, or because of fixation of a tiny fragment of the typical <i>EDA</i> haplotype. The NAKA population may be useful in the future for distinguishing the phenotypic effects of the isolated T \u2192 G regulatory change versus the larger <i>EDA</i> haplotype typically found in most low-plated sticklebacks."

Alternatively, the T \u2192 G change could represent one of very few possible ways of producing a major change in armor plate patterns while still preserving other functions of the <i>EDA</i> gene. A constrained spectrum of mutations has been observed in other contexts involving very specific phenotypes. For example, nearly all patients with classic achondroplasia contain the same Gly380Arg (G \u2192 C) substitution in FGFR3 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Horton et al., 2007</a>). This Gly380Arg substitution leads to a constitutively active FGF receptor that is thought to confer a selective advantage to spermatogonial cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tiemann-Boege et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Choi et al., 2008</a>). Identical amino acid substitutions in particular genes also underlie several examples of repeated evolution including insecticide resistance in insects (<i>GABA</i>), tetrodotoxin resistance in snakes (<i>NaK-ATPase</i>), C4 photosynthesis in plants (<i>PEPC</i>), and dark pigmentation in mice and birds (<i>MC1R</i>) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stern, 2013</a>). These and other well-studied cases typically involve particular amino acid changes that alter protein activity in specific ways, rather than completely ablating protein function. In contrast, few examples are known of identical recurrent base pair mutations in non-coding regulatory sequences (<a href=\"#bib46\">Martin and Orgogozo, 2013</a>), though multiple cases are now being uncovered in large-scale sequencing surveys of replicate microbial evolution (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tenaillon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Blank et al., 2014</a>). In a recent large-scale study of parallel temperature adaptation over 2000 generations, recurrent use of particular genes was at least 10 times more common than recurrent use of the same base pair changes within those genes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tenaillon et al., 2012</a>). Of the relatively rare recurrent base pair changes, those affecting protein-coding sequence also outnumbered those affecting non-coding intergenic sequence by nearly threefold. The T \u2192 G base pair change we have identified near <i>EDA</i> provides a rare example in vertebrates of a particular non-coding base pair change contributing to repeated adaptive evolution."

Although canonical Wnt signaling typically acts through the \u03b2-catenin and Lef transcription factors, the particular T \u2192 G base pair change we have identified does not alter a canonical Lef binding sequence. However, Wnt signaling is known to interact with multiple additional signaling and transcription factor pathways, and the T \u2192 G change does alter a predicted binding site for c-Jun in the marine sequence (<a href=\"#bib53\">Newburger and Bulyk, 2009</a>), which can act in collaboration with Wnt signaling in chondrocyte dedifferentiation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hwang et al., 2005</a>), osteopontin promoter activation in mammary cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">El-Tanani et al., 2004</a>), and complexes with \u03b2-catenin to bind the promoters of Wnt target genes both in mammalian cells and in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gan et al., 2008</a>). There are seven base pair positions in the predicted marine c-Jun binding site, and 21 corresponding single bp mutations that could alter one of these bases. 19 of these potential mutations are predicted to eliminate c-Jun binding (<a href=\"#bib47\">Messeguer et al., 2002</a>). Of these 19 mutations, the T \u2192 G change found in low- plated sticklebacks is the only mutation that is also predicted to create a new overlapping binding site for AP-2\u03b1 in the low-plated sequence. AP-2\u03b1 has been shown to inhibit Wnt signaling by complexing with APC/\u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib41\">Li and Dashwood, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2009b</a>). A new binding site for AP-2\u03b1 could contribute to the reduced Wnt responsiveness of the freshwater <i>EDA</i> gene, or may contribute to other novel expression patterns that are not yet understood (such as the enhanced cyanoacrylate response we have observed with the T \u2192 G mutated enhancer). Future experiments are needed to test whether c-Jun, AP-2\u03b1 or other factors interact directly with the <i>EDA</i> enhancer of either marine or freshwater sticklebacks. However, the simultaneous loss and gain of specific binding sites is a good example of the type of dual molecular constraints that could limit the range of possible base pair substitutions found underlying adaptive regulatory evolution at the <i>EDA</i> locus."

Given the dramatic effects of Wnt signaling on armor plate development and <i>EDA</i> regulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 6</a>), these or other components of the Wnt signaling pathway are strong candidates for additional loci that may contribute to the adaptive fine-tuning of armor plate numbers that is known to occur in many low-plated populations (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hagen and Gilbertson, 1972</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Moodie, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Moodie et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bell and Haglund, 1978</a>)."

(This work was carried out in part by Shannon Brady, who has now been added a co-author of the manuscript). This survey showed that most completely plated marine animals are homozygous for the marine \u201cT\u201d allele, but a small number of fish are heterozygous carriers of the freshwater \u201cG\u201d allele (overall minor G allele frequency: 2.3%). We also typed these heterozygous fish with flanking markers, to distinguish between carriers of large, small, or recombinant freshwater <i>EDA</i> haplotypes. These data are summarized in a new <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, and a corresponding section has been added to both the Discussion (paragraph 5) and the Materials and methods (paragraph 3) to cover the new material."

While there are multiple mutations that can potentially disrupt the c-Jun site previously mentioned in the Discussion, the observed T-&gt;G change is the only base pair mutation that is predicted to both eliminate a c-Jun site in the marine enhancer, and to simultaneously create a new overlapping AP-2 alpha site in the freshwater sequence. We describe these predicted mutational effects in an enlarged paragraph 7 of the Discussion, and discuss how the dual effects of the T-&gt;G mutation could be an example of combined molecular constraints that limit the range of base pair mutations observed in low-plated populations."

This analysis shows much greater geographic structuring among freshwater <i>EDA</i> alleles than among marine <i>EDA</i> alleles, which is consistent with repeated rounds of gene flow from freshwater fish into migratory marine populations, rather than selection from ancestral diversity already present in marine populations (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schulter and Conte, 2009</a>).
