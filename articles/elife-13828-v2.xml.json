Recent studies report that mice lacking glucagon receptor (<i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i>) do not develop diabetes following streptozotocin (STZ)-mediated ablation of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells. Here, we show that diabetes prevention in STZ-treated <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals requires remnant insulin action originating from spared residual \u03b2-cells: these mice indeed became hyperglycemic after insulin receptor blockade. Accordingly, <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice developed hyperglycemia after induction of a more complete, diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced \u03b2-cell loss, a situation of near-absolute insulin deficiency similar to type 1 diabetes. In addition, glucagon deficiency did not impair the natural capacity of \u03b1-cells to reprogram into insulin production after extreme \u03b2-cell loss. \u03b1-to-\u03b2-cell conversion was improved in <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice as a consequence of \u03b1-cell hyperplasia. Collectively, these results indicate that glucagon antagonism could i) be a useful adjuvant therapy in diabetes only when residual insulin action persists, and ii) help devising future \u03b2-cell regeneration therapies relying upon \u03b1-cell reprogramming."

Recent studies report that mice lacking glucagon receptor (<i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i>) do not develop diabetes following streptozotocin (STZ)-mediated ablation of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells. Here, we show that diabetes prevention in STZ-treated <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals requires remnant insulin action originating from spared residual \u03b2-cells: these mice indeed became hyperglycemic after insulin receptor blockade. Accordingly, <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice developed hyperglycemia after induction of a more complete, diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced \u03b2-cell loss, a situation of near-absolute insulin deficiency similar to type 1 diabetes. In addition, glucagon deficiency did not impair the natural capacity of \u03b1-cells to reprogram into insulin production after extreme \u03b2-cell loss. \u03b1-to-\u03b2-cell conversion was improved in <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice as a consequence of \u03b1-cell hyperplasia. Collectively, these results indicate that glucagon antagonism could i) be a useful adjuvant therapy in diabetes only when residual insulin action persists, and ii) help devising future \u03b2-cell regeneration therapies relying upon \u03b1-cell reprogramming."

Mice that lacked glucagon receptors that had been treated with streptozotocin also developed diabetes after they had been treated with an insulin-blocking drug. Further experiments showed that blocking glucagon receptors in typical mice with diabetes reduces blood sugar, but only if there is some insulin left in their bodies."

Such treatment would help reduce the release of sugar from the liver and increase the production of insulin in converted alpha cells in the pancreas.

In consequence, antagonists of glucagon signaling are currently being tested in clinical trials for diabetes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campbell and Drucker, 2015</a>). The importance of glucagon signaling in diabetes was recently highlighted in studies performed with glucagon receptor knockout (<i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i>) mice and in animals lacking \u03b1-cells due to pancreatic aristaless-related homeobox (<i>Arx</i>) deficiency. Surprisingly, these animals did not exhibit the usual signs of diabetes, such as hyperglycemia or glucose intolerance, after streptozotocin (STZ)-mediated \u03b2-cell destruction (<a href=\"#bib7\">Conarello et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hancock et al., 2010</a>). These findings lead to hypothesize that glucagon is responsible for the features of diabetes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Unger and Cherrington, 2012</a>). Although suppression of glucagon action is likely to attenuate the consequences of insulin deficiency, its primary role in the hyperglycemia is uncertain. Indeed, because STZ causes an incomplete \u03b2-cell ablation due to variations in administration protocols and in genetic background-dependent sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deeds et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cardinal et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gurley, 2006</a>), it is possible that the \u201cdiabetes resistance\u201d phenotype of <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice relies on the action of insulin from residual \u03b2-cells. Thus, to determine whether lack of glucagon signaling would also prevent hyperglycemia and diabetes in the context of a more severe insulin deficiency, we used a transgenic model of diphtheria toxin (DT)-mediated \u03b2-cell ablation, termed <i>RIP-DTR</i>, which leads to an almost complete \u03b2-cell elimination (<a href=\"#bib40\">Thorel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chera et al., 2014</a>). Also, because adult <i>RIP-DTR</i> mice spontaneously reconstitute new insulin-producing cells by \u03b1-cell transdifferentiation in this condition of severe insulin insufficiency, we explored whether the compensatory \u03b1-cell hyperplasia due to glucagon signaling blockade (<a href=\"#bib11\">Furuta et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gelling et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Longuet et al., 2013</a>) influences the reprogramming of \u03b1-cells toward insulin production."

Since these abnormalities may encompass long-lasting compensatory metabolic adaptations, we conditionally inhibited glucagon action in adult mice that had developed normally using a glucagon receptor antagonizing monoclonal antibody (anti-GCGR mAb). We first assessed its activity in C57BL/6 wild type mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In agreement with a previously described antibody (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yan et al., 2009</a>), anti-GCGR treatment led to a reduction in basal glycemia (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and triggered \u03b1-cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy, as observed in <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gelling et al., 2003</a>).

In agreement with the above results using <i>RIP-DTR;Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals, all mice became severely hyperglycemic and lost weight after DT, regardless of antibody treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we compared the relative ablation efficiencies of these two methods. To maximize \u03b2-cell destruction, we treated <i>Gcgr<sup>+/-</sup></i> and <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice with two high doses of STZ (200 and 150 mg/kg, one week apart). Following the first injection, control mice became severely hyperglycemic. By contrast, <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals remained normoglycemic even after the second STZ injection, as previously reported (not shown) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">2012</a>). <i>RIP-DTR;Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals remained markedly hyperglucagonemic after STZ- or DT-mediated \u03b2-cell loss and \u03b1-cell mass was not affected (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). Histologically, we observed that nearly 90% of islet sections were totally devoid of \u03b2-cells after DT, versus only 45% after STZ (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Accordingly, the \u03b2-cell mass and pancreatic insulin content were reduced by 98\u201399% after DT, but only by 70\u201380% after STZ (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>). In addition, plasma insulin levels were just above detection threshold after DT, but readily detectable after STZ (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We made similar observations in mice with normal glucagon signaling (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

In agreement with its previously reported action, S961 administration in <i>Gcgr<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice triggered a strong increase in glycemia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; blue dashed vs black continuous line). Interestingly, <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals exhibited a smaller but significant increase in glycemia, indicating that glucagon deficiency has a beneficial effect in this situation of relative insulin deficit (purple dashed vs red continuous line). Although STZ-treated <i>Gcgr</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice remained normoglycemic, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib7\">Conarello et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">2012</a>), they developed severe hyperglycemia after insulin receptor inhibition (continuous vs dotted purple line).

                                "text": "To better characterize the effect of insulin insufficiency in a glucagon-deficient context, we evaluated hepatic transcript levels of Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) and Glucokinase (Gck), two hormone-sensitive enzymes whose transcription is regulated by the relative levels of glucagon and insulin signaling (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ruckt\u00e4schel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chakravarty et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Iynedjian et al., 1995</a>). Liver is a relevant organ to assess the impact of insulin and glucagon deficiency because re-expression of the glucagon receptor in the liver of STZ-treated <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, and conditional inactivation of the insulin receptor in hepatocytes are both sufficient to trigger hyperglycemia (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Michael et al., 2000</a>). In conditions of glucagon deficiency (increased insulin/glucagon ratio; <i>Gcgr</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice), we observed a decreased expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme Pepck and an increased expression of the glycolytic enzyme Gck as compared to <i>Gcgr<sup>+/-</sup></i> controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), which is consistent with a previous study (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). By contrast, upon induced insulin deficiency (decreased insulin/glucagon ratio), as in STZ-, S961-, or DT-treated Gcgr<sup>+/-</sup> animals, Pepck and Gck exhibited the opposite regulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We observed the strongest effect after DT, which caused a 1000-fold decrease in Gck expression, suggesting that it led to a more complete suppression of insulin action than STZ or S961. When inducing insulin insufficiency in a <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> background, a situation of combined insulin and glucagon deficiency, we observed Pepck and Gck mRNA levels similar to those measured in untreated <i>Gcgr<sup>+/-</sup></i> control mice, except after DT, which induced a strong downregulation of Gck expression in <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> livers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We also confirmed the increase in hepatic PEPCK expression after DT at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, DT-, but not STZ-treatment depleted liver glycogen stores in <i>RIP-DTR;Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results suggest that lack of glucagon action can compensate for the effect of partial insulin insufficiency on the expression of rate-limiting enzymes and hepatic glycogen metabolism, but not after near-total \u03b2-cell loss, a situation where the effect of insulin deficiency outweighs that of glucagon deficiency."

Once the animals were hyperglycemic, we implanted them with an osmotic pump containing the anti-GCGR mAb. In mice injected with 175 mg/kg STZ, antibody treatment strongly reduced, but did not completely normalize, blood glucose levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). By contrast, animals that had received 225 mg/kg STZ remained severely hyperglycemic (&gt;30\u2009mM) after anti-GCGR mAb administration. As expected, residual pancreatic insulin content negatively correlated with the dose of STZ (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We thus observed beneficial effects of glucagon signaling inhibition only in diabetic mice that had retained a relatively higher pancreatic insulin after STZ-mediated \u03b2-cell loss. Strikingly, the impact of glucagon signaling inhibition on the glycemia of diabetic mice was dependent on very small measurable differences in residual pancreatic insulin, as seen after 175 and 225 mg/kg STZ (respectively 1.79% and 0.45% of the pancreatic insulin content of non-ablated controls). As seen in <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals, anti-GCGR mAb administration resulted in a lower expression of hepatic Pepck (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, the highest STZ dose triggered a stronger glucokinase downregulation than the 175 mg/kg dose in mAb-treated mice."

Previous studies have shown that STZ-mediated \u03b2-cell ablation does not induce diabetes in the <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse model (<a href=\"#bib7\">Conarello et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">2012</a>), giving rise to the hypothesis that mice cannot develop hyperglycemia in absence of glucagon action (<a href=\"#bib44\">Unger and Cherrington, 2012</a>).

These discrepancies may be explained by differences in completeness of \u03b2-cell ablation linked to the protocol of injection (single high dose versus multiple low doses) and/or to strain-dependent sensitivity; it was indeed reported that BALB/c mice are less sensitive to STZ than C57BL/6 animals (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cardinal et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gurley, 2006</a>). Here, we injected C57BL/6 mice with two different high doses of STZ that triggered a severe hyperglycemia; after anti-GCGR mAb treatment, however, we observed a decrease in glycemia only in animals treated with the lowest STZ dose. These results indicate that a small difference in pancreatic insulin, such as that observed after 175 and 225 mg/kg STZ, can cause a major difference in glycemia in animals lacking glucagon signaling, thereby highlighting the importance of residual insulin action and providing a potential explanation for discrepancies between previous studies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Remarkably, STZ-treated <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice became hyperglycemic upon S961-mediated insulin receptor antagonism, illustrating the requirement of residual insulin action for maintenance of normoglycemia in these animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a total absence of glucagon action is not sufficient to prevent hyperglycemia in case of severe insulin deficiency."

Our data on hepatic expression of Pepck and Gck, two rate-limiting enzymes of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, respectively, suggest that lack of glucagon signaling counterbalances the effects of insulin insufficiency after STZ or S961. This would prevent, or limit, the rise in net hepatic glucose output by decreasing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, and by increasing glycolysis and glycogenesis. Absence of glucagon action is however not sufficient to compensate severe insulin deficiency after DT, as reflected by Gck downregulation and reduced hepatic glycogen content, thereby contributing to the elevation of blood glucose. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of FoxO1 target genes in skeletal muscle were strongly upregulated, reflecting insulin signaling insufficiency, after DT and STZ+S961, the two conditions that led to hyperglycemia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In addition, gonadal adipose tissue was markedly depleted in experimental conditions leading to hyperglycemia (in <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice after STZ+S691 and DT; in <i>Gcgr<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice after STZ and DT; not shown). Together, these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which lack of glucagon signaling protects against elevated blood glucose levels in situations of insulin insufficiency. Recent studies have shown that protection against STZ-mediated hyperglycemia also rely on the high levels of circulating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jun, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Omar et al., 2014</a>). Yet, these high levels of GLP-1 combined with a lack of glucagon action were insufficient to maintain normoglycemia after near-total \u03b2-cell loss."

Indeed, YFP-traced \u03b1-cells become glucagon/insulin bihormonal cells after DT in <i>RIP-DTR;Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice and in animals treated with the anti-GCGR antibody (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The proportion of \u03b1-cells co-expressing insulin after DT is comparable between mice with either intact, reduced or absent glucagon signaling, indicating that glucagon does not play an essential role in the \u03b1-to-\u03b2 transdifferentiation process. Interestingly, because glucagon signaling inhibition leads to a compensatory \u03b1-cell hyperplasia (<a href=\"#bib11\">Furuta et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gelling et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Longuet et al., 2013</a>), the absolute number of newly formed insulin-producing cells through \u03b1-cell conversion was augmented in <i>RIP-DTR;Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice.

                        "text": "In conclusion, although inhibition of glucagon action alone is insufficient to prevent diabetes in conditions of near-total insulin deficiency, it is beneficial when residual insulin action persists, as in STZ-treated <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals. Combination of glucagon inhibition with insulin therapy may however increase the risk of hypoglycemia. We encountered this problem when using subcutaneous insulin pellets in DT-treated <i>RIP-DTR;Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice: they became hypoglycemic and died likely as a consequence of the constitutive insulin release from the pellets, which could not be compensated by glucagon action. Our findings suggest that diabetes therapy through glucagon suppression would be unsafe if exogenous insulin has to be supplemented, but may be beneficial in patients with sufficient residual insulin action. In case of near-total insulin deficiency, transient glucagon receptor blockade could also serve as a means to increase the \u03b1-cell mass before triggering insulin production in these cells, a strategy that might be envisioned as a novel therapy to treat diabetes."

This work from Herrera and colleagues demonstrates (though doesn't quite prove) that the model used by Unger and colleagues was likely to involve persistent insulin production and signalling, rather weakening this assertion. The other observation here \u2013 that \u03b1 cells can still convert to \u03b2 cells in the absence of glucagon signalling \u2013 is also interesting, but is arguably tangential to the main thrust of the paper."

The paper would be stronger if mass were measured in some groups of the mice used in this study. In particular, in would be of great interest to know the \u03b2 cell mass required to prevent diabetes with and without glucagon receptors either knocked out or blocked. Related to this, it would also be of value to determine the mass of \u03b1 cells and the mass of insulin/glucagon double positive cells. This gets at the important question of understanding of how many \u03b2 cells can be generated from \u03b1 cells and whether they make a meaningful contribution to insulin secretion."

However, differences in sensitivity to STZ between <i>Gcgr+/-</i> and <i>Gcgr-/-</i> mice makes it difficult to obtain a similar ablation efficiency in these two genotypes. A large cohort of mice treated with different doses of STZ combined or not with anti-GCGR mAb administration would be required to accurately evaluate the minimal \u03b2-cell mass needed to prevent diabetes in situations of normal or blocked glucagon signaling. In this study, we already observe a beneficial effect of glucagon receptor blockade therapy on the glycemia of STZ-treated C57BL/6 mice in presence of a tiny amount of residual insulin (1.79% of pancreatic insulin content, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

After DT in <i>RIP-DTR;Gcgr-/-</i> animals, we find that the average \u03b1-cell mass is 4.92 mg (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and that 0.73% of glucagon-positive cells make insulin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Thus, we can estimate the bihormonal cell mass to be around 36 \u03bcg, that is less than 3% of the \u03b2-cell mass in untreated mice. Even if these cells were secreting insulin like \u03b2-cells, this amount would be insufficient to prevent hyperglycemia. Rescuing insulin deficiency by conversion of \u03b1-cells will therefore require additional interventions to promote \u03b1-cell reprogramming. This however falls outside of the scope of this manuscript."

Glucagon immunoneutralisation was tested, with the same results as reported here. However, glucagon signalling was also disrupted by ablation of glucagon-secreting \u03b1 cells or using a glucagon receptor antibody. This paper should be discussed. Even older work from the same laboratory (PMID: 7851693) is also relevant here and should be cited."

Combined, these data support the hypothesis that DT treatment causes a severe insulin deficiency that cannot be compensated by the absence of glucagon signaling in these animals. This likely leads to a higher glucose mobilization and/or a lower glucose uptake resulting in hyperglycemia and diabetes."
