However, it is not known where reward signals interact with the multiple stages of the perceptual decision-making pathway and by what mechanisms this may occur. We combined electrical microstimulation of functionally specific groups of neurons in visual area V5/MT with performance-contingent reward manipulation, while monkeys performed a visual discrimination task. Microstimulation was less effective in shifting perceptual choices towards the stimulus preferences of the stimulated neurons when available reward was larger. Psychophysical control experiments showed this result was not explained by a selective change in response strategy on microstimulated trials. A bounded accumulation decision model, applied to analyse behavioural performance, revealed that the interaction of expected reward with microstimulation can be explained if expected reward modulates a sensory representation stage of perceptual decision-making, in addition to the better-known effects at the integration stage."

Balancing sensory evidence with the prospect of reward must take place on a case-by-case basis for every trial in which a decision is made. When sensory information is used simply to signal the availability of reward in value-based decisions, the activity of lateral intraparietal (LIP) neurons correlates with the relative reward an animal can expect for a particular choice (<a href=\"#bib42\">Platt and Glimcher, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sugrue et al., 2004</a>). In perceptual decision-making, however, making a correct decision requires the discrimination of one version of the stimulus from another. Experimentally, different perceptual choices can be arranged to receive greater or lesser reward, contingent upon a correct decision. Such manipulations affect perceptual decision-making, for example by improving performance or biasing decisions (e.g., <a href=\"#bib60\">Summerfield and Koechlin 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Weil et al. 2010</a>).

In the present study, we artificially activate motion- and disparity-selective neurons in visual area V5/MT with electrical microstimulation. Microstimulation biases perceptual choices towards visual interpretations that match the tuning of the stimulated neurons (<a href=\"#bib26\">Krug et al., 2013</a>). In visual discrimination tasks, sensory evidence is integrated over time into a decision variable (DV), represented in the activity of neurons in lateral intraparietal cortex (area LIP; see <a href=\"#bib23\">Gold and Shadlen 2007</a> for review). Since visually evoked and electrically evoked signals both influence behaviour, they are presumably integrated together to influence the DV. The results of evidence integration also affect activity in the frontal eye fields (FEF) that represent the planning of eye movements (saccades), which animals use to indicate their perceptual decision in the discrimination task (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Previous studies have established an influence of reward on neural representations in sensorimotor regions such as area LIP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Platt and Glimcher, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sugrue et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rorie et al., 2010</a>).

A stronger indication comes from a study in which neuronal responses from area V1 were electrophysiologically recorded while animals performed a saccadic curve-tracing task (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stanisor et al., 2013</a>). This study showed that V1 activity was predicted by the reward value of a stimulus relative to other stimuli, implying that reward signals have the potential to reach the earliest stages of sensory cortical processing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Such interventions provide strong evidence for a causal role of that region in generating that behaviour or report (<a href=\"#bib41\">Parker and Newsome, 1998</a>). Electrical microstimulation of small populations of neurons in relevant cortical regions, combined with sensory stimulation, can produce reliable changes in perceptual reports, which are specific to the stimulus preferences of the neurons at the microstimulated site (<a href=\"#bib50\">Salzman et al., 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">1992</a>). When the stimulated neurons encode combinations of visual cues, microstimulation adds a signal that is specific to that combination, as found in cortical area V5/MT for visual motion and binocular disparity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Krug et al., 2013</a>). Using microstimulation to bias perceptual choices under different reward conditions is a novel approach with which to explore the interaction between expected reward and sensory signals that contribute directly to perceptual decisions."

On the other hand, reward could have a differential effect on neurons that have been specifically excited by either visual or electrical microstimulation. We found that the size of the microstimulation effect on perceptual choices was modulated by the size of the available reward for a correct choice. In the context of a simplified bounded evidence-accumulation model, these results were best explained by an effect of reward on neuronal representations of sensory evidence, in addition to an effect on the integration stage."

This stimulus portrays two transparent surfaces of moving dots, with the dots on one surface moving in the opposite direction from the dots on the other surface. This pattern of motion generates a percept of a rotating cylinder with a compelling sensation of 3D depth (<a href=\"#bib61\">Treue et al., 1991</a>) (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Adding binocular disparities to the dots defines the depth order of the two dot surfaces and specifies the direction of rotation of the cylinder to be clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) as viewed from above. If both dot surfaces have zero disparity, then the depth order of the stimulus is ambiguous and the perception is bistable (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nawrot and Blake, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Parker and Krug, 2003</a>). Cylinders were presented at a range of binocular disparities, measured in degrees of visual angle (\u00b0), in a pseudo-randomized order (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dodd et al., 2001</a>). At the end of each 2000 ms trial, animals indicated their decision about cylinder rotation with a saccadic eye movement to the appropriate target (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). When the binocular disparity objectively defined an unambiguous rotation, the animal was rewarded for a correct choice of rotation direction. When there was zero binocular disparity, there was no correct answer and choices were rewarded randomly on 50% of these trials. Electrical microstimulation of motion- and disparity-selective multi-units (MU) in visual cortical area V5/MT was applied during visual stimulus presentation in a randomly selected half of the trials. Area V5/MT has been shown to have a specific role in 3D depth processing (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dodd et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Krug et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Krug and Parker, 2011</a>), and to contain specialised intrinsic connectivity suitable for combining visual depth and motion signals (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed et al., 2012</a>), relevant for the cylinder stimulus. As previously reported, electrical microstimulation of area V5/MT biases animals' choices towards the cylinder rotation direction preferred (PREF) by the MU (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> likelihood-ratio test of nested models <a href=\"#equ1a equ1b\">Equations 1a,b</a>, p &lt; 0.05 in 28 out of 48 sites; Fle: 13/20 sites; Ica: 15/28 sites) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Krug et al., 2013</a>). When combined with simultaneous visual stimulation, these artificially induced signals are effectively integrated into perceptual decisions and consistently influence behaviour in this visual task."

The visual stimulus was then presented for 2000 ms, within the receptive field (RF) of the V5/MT multi-unit site selected for microstimulation (yellow dashed circle indicates RF location). Upon stimulus offset, two choice targets appeared. The monkey indicated its perceptual decision with an eye movement to one of the choice targets (left for clockwise [CW] rotation and right for counter-clockwise [CCW]). If the response was correct, the animal received a fluid reward; if incorrect, it received no reward and a time-out. On 50% of trials (pseudo-randomly chosen), electrical microstimulation was added to the V5/MT multi-unit site during visual stimulus presentation. Inset panels: Fluid reward volume increased in two steps up to a maximum depending upon the animal's performance history, that is, the number of immediately preceding consecutive correct choices. Reward size increased more quickly for Fle than Ica as a function of consecutive correct responses, but for both animals we categorized the trials into two conditions: maximal reward size (\u2018large\u2019) and sub-maximal reward size (\u2018small\u2019).

The time-varying accumulation of evidence is termed the <i>decision variable</i> (DV; black line). (<b>B</b>) The bounded accumulation model applied to the cylinder task with microstimulation. The momentary evidence (<i>e</i>) is the difference in activity between two neuronal pools, one selective for CW rotation and one for CCW rotation. Parameter <i>k</i> represents the sensitivity of these sensory representations to the cylinder disparity <i>C</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Palmer et al., 2005</a>). In each trial, the DV follows a stochastic \u2018drift-diffusion\u2019 path with an average drift rate dependent on the mean of <i>e</i> = <i>kC</i>. Parameter <i>B</i> represents the distances to the CW and CCW decision bounds, which are assumed to be equal. Microstimulation contributes to <i>e</i> as additional evidence in favour of the sensory preference of the stimulated V5/MT multi-unit site (CCW in this example). The perceptual decision depends on which bound was first reached, or, if neither is reached, which bound the DV is nearest to at the end of stimulus viewing. (<b>C</b>) Model simulations illustrate that the slope of the psychometric function, fitted by a simple logistic model of bounded accumulation (<a href=\"#equ3a\">Equation 3a</a>), can be affected by changes in either parameter <i>k</i> or <i>B</i>; for example, an increase in either parameter will steepen the slope, indicating improved performance. (<b>D</b>) Model simulations illustrate how insertion of additional sensory evidence by electrical microstimulation in visual cortex biases perceptual choices toward the preferred (PREF) cylinder disparity of the stimulated multi-unit (MU), which is revealed as a shift of the psychometric function. (<b>E</b>) An increase in parameter <i>B</i> steepens the slope of the psychometric functions, but does not change the size of microstimulation shift. This is because by the evidence-accumulation stage, visually evoked and electrically evoked signals are combined and cannot be differentially affected (see panel B). (<b>F</b>) An increase in parameter <i>k</i> also steepens the slope of the psychometric function. However, improved perceptual sensitivity to the stimulus affects only the visually-evoked sensory representations (see panel B), so the relative contribution of the electrically-evoked signals is decreased, which results in a decrease in the microstimulation-induced shift of the psychometric function."

Sensory evidence is integrated over time to influence the drift-diffusion of the decision variable (DV) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</a>). The DV starts at a particular distance from the two decision bounds and, during stimulus viewing, drifts stochastically towards one or other decision bound at a rate proportional to the sensory evidence favouring the prospective choices. Upon stimulus offset, the animal makes a saccade towards the target that corresponds to its perceptual choice, which depends upon either the first bound that was crossed or, if no bound was crossed, the bound nearer to the DV final position (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kiani et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fetsch et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

This is because increasing the perceptual sensitivity to the stimulus allows smaller stimulus disparity signals to have a greater effect on the perceptual decision; on the other hand, increasing the diffusion distance to the decision bounds decreases the relative impact of spurious noise on the final decision (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>). The contributions of these parameters cannot be differentiated based upon these perceptual choice data alone because they both improve performance. However, these parameters make different predictions about what should happen to visual cortical microstimulation when performance improves. Electrical microstimulation biases perceptual decisions towards the PREF direction of the stimulated MU site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krug et al., 2013</a>). If performance in large reward trials improves as a result of an increase in <i>B</i>, this will not affect the size of the microstimulation shift, because <i>B</i> acts at an integration stage that is positioned after the location at which visually evoked and electrically evoked signals have been combined (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). If performance improves as a result of an increase in <i>k</i>, this will decrease the relative influence of microstimulation on perceptual choices (illustrated by a smaller horizontal shift between microstimulated and non-microstimulated psychometric functions) because <i>k</i> acts specifically on visually evoked sensory representations before they are combined with electrical microstimulation signals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Therefore, the insertion of the electrical microstimulation signal at the level of representation of sensory evidence (area V5/MT) allows us to separate the effects of parameters <i>k</i> and <i>B</i> according to this model."

Nevertheless, to examine the possibility of such a strategy, we performed a set of psychophysical control experiments with monkey Ica that reproduced the effect of electrical microstimulation using a visual stimulus perturbation.

In our experiment, the trials with the \u2206dx signal were overtly flagged by a change in the appearance of the cylinder stimulus from all black dots to all white dots (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This change in cylinder appearance is highly salient to human observers and we assume it is also salient for the monkey. Importantly, the animal was only rewarded for perceptual choices that would have been correct had the additional disparity signal not been present. This creates a form of \u2018microstimulation\u2019 experiment in which the presence of the extra disparity cue \u2206dx is clearly signalled by a change in stimulus colour from black to white. The animal was first trained over 10 days and 45,000 trials on this task. Unlike the electrical microstimulation experiments, which contained a mixture of microstimulation biases across different V5/MT sites, favouring sometimes CW and sometimes CCW choices, the added disparity signal \u2206dx always gave a consistent shift towards CCW perceptual choices. This increased the chance that the animal would engage in a strategy that exploited all available information to reduce its error rate and gain more reward."

By contrast, under the same model, reward significantly reduced the electrical microstimulation shift for both Fle and Ica (see main text).

The raw overall microstimulation effect also significantly correlated with the cylinder discrimination threshold at each site (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The reward modulation of the raw microstimulation shift effect was significantly correlated with stimulus eccentricity and with the raw overall microstimulation effect size for both animals considered together, and for one animal considered alone (Ica), such that the biggest raw effects of reward on microstimulation occurred for sites with largest eccentricity (where thresholds were high) and the biggest raw overall microstimulation effect (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). However, these correlations disappeared for reward modulation of the microstimulation shift effect when normalised by cylinder discrimination threshold at each site (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>). This shows that the reward effect is constant when microstimulation is expressed as a fraction of the discrimination threshold."

Such a co-variation could explain the difference in microstimulation effect by reward. A running average of the proportion of large reward trials was calculated for each experimental session at each significant PREF microstimulation site (significant shift in the PREF stimulus direction), across both animals.

In an alternative interpretation, slower fluctuations in task engagement, rather than expected reward size, are the cause of the observed effects. Variations in task engagement would be expected to occur at least an order of magnitude slower (over the space of around 30 trials) than differential valuations of upcoming reward (which occur over the space of two or three trials; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

The size of the perceptual shift induced by electrical microstimulation was smaller when the available reward for a correct choice was larger. These results suggest that reward signals interact differently with visually evoked and artificially introduced sensory information. A simplified bounded accumulation model of perceptual decision-making best explains the data if expected reward is allowed to affect the representation of sensory evidence. This effect of reward is in addition to an effect upon the integration of that evidence during the formation of the perceptual decision. If reward were to affect only the integration stage, it should influence behavioural responses to neural signals in the same way regardless of whether those signals have been evoked by visual input or artificially by microstimulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Experimentally, however, we found the converse (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We propose that, on this view, reward interacts with the sensory/perceptual signals in cortical representations of the visual stimulus during visual perceptual decision-making, in addition to affecting the integration stage (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

When <i>both</i> choices are associated with larger rewards, as in the present study, the distance to <i>both</i> decision bounds might be expected to decrease, as we, and others (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rorie et al., 2010</a>), have found. On its own, this effect would impair performance accuracy when available reward is large because the closer proximity of the DV to the bounds would result in a greater effect of accumulated noise on the final perceptual choice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rorie et al., 2010</a>).

In a control experiment, in which an additional visual disparity (\u2206dx) signal that mimicked the microstimulation effect was clearly cued by a change in stimulus colour, the effect of \u2206dx on choices was not affected by expected reward size, even though overall task performance was better in large reward trials as seen in the electrical microstimulation sessions. This indicates that the animal did not apply a strategy to compensate for the \u2206dx signal specifically on large reward trials, even when trials that contained additional visual disparity were clearly identifiable. This experiment controls for the situation in which microstimulation produces a different percept that the animal is able to discount more effectively when available reward is higher. However, this psychophysical experiment cannot simulate possible noise or other aberrance in inputs associated with electrically evoked sensory neuronal activity, which, for example, might be weighed less compared to more \u2018normal\u2019, visually evoked inputs; weights that could change based on expected reward. We discuss this issue further in the next section."

Therefore, instead of expected reward size, fluctuations in task engagement (for example due to attentional or motivational states) could result in epochs of good and bad performance, which are inevitably associated with more large reward or small reward trials respectively. These fluctuations could therefore potentially underlie the observed association between large reward trials and better performance, and the observed effects on the microstimulation shift. However, a time-series analysis of performance over the course of the microstimulation experimental sessions showed that there was no correlation between the performance fluctuation and the differential effect of microstimulation by reward. Furthermore, when trials in each microstimulation session were separated according to whether they occurred in a \u2018good epoch\u2019 (a window of better-than-average performance) or \u2018bad epoch\u2019 (poorer-than-average performance), the modulation of microstimulation shift by reward size remained within both types of epoch. These analyses, which monitor closely engagement with the task over time, provide evidence against the hypothesis that the differential microstimulation effect can be accounted for purely by fluctuations in task engagement. Future experiments can directly rule out this possibility by varying reward size independently of performance, for example by using a block design or trial-by-trial cueing of the available reward size."

However, the circuit mechanisms of the effect of electrical microstimulation are incompletely understood, and microstimulation has been reported to have unanticipated inhibitory effects on downstream cortical targets (<a href=\"#bib30\">Logothetis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sultan et al., 2011</a>). Such observations have generally been made in anaesthetised animals, without the concurrent presentation of a visual stimulus expected to activate the same brain areas as microstimulation, and at stimulation currents orders of magnitude higher than used in this study (250\u20131000 \u03bcA, compared to our 20 \u03bcA).

Our \u2206dx experiment cannot control for this case because we added the additional stimulus disparity signal via visual stimulation that by this argument cannot mimic the artificially induced microstimulation signal. However, we argue that there is currently little evidence to suggest that the brain applies differential weights to electrically and visually evoked sensory signals in this way. It is important to note that microstimulation affects behaviour in both large and small reward trials, suggesting that it is not an aberrant signal but a clear signal that affects perceptual choices in all cases. When combined with relevant visual stimulation, electrical microstimulation in many visual cortical areas significantly and reliably affects behaviour in a variety of visual perceptual tasks (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cicmil and Krug, 2015</a>). If the microstimulation signal could affect final motor output via a neural path independent from visually evoked signals, it would be expected that microstimulation would be detectable and/or processed by the brain in some qualitatively different way. But a recent study that modelled in detail the relationship between microstimulation, perceptual choices and decision confidence found that their data did not support the view that microstimulation induces a change in neural activity that is processed qualitatively differently from visually evoked activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fetsch et al., 2014</a>), and our \u2206dx control shows that the animal cannot use an obvious difference in the stimulus percept to discard some of the visual information provided."

We used the assumption that the accumulator inputs are perfectly negatively correlated, which corresponds to the action of one accumulator only (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Palmer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>). To avoid unnecessary assumptions and over-fitting, we chose the simplest model framework that could explain our findings. The microstimulation signal was modelled as additional sensory evidence towards the cylinder rotation direction preferences of the microstimulated neurons. The null choice bias, whereby animals apply an overall bias towards the non-preferred direction of the stimulated neurons in order to match overall reward proportions for different choices (<a href=\"#bib51\">Salzman et al., 1992</a>), was modelled as an offset to the overall psychometric function (<a href=\"#equ3a\">Equation 3a</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The parameters of the bounded accumulation model are commonly used to explain both choice and reaction time. However, bounded integration underlies perceptual decisions even when stimulus viewing duration is dictated by the environment (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kiani et al., 2008</a>), and the model can be fit usefully in these circumstances (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fetsch et al., 2014</a>). Although we employed a fixed viewing duration task, differential effects of reward on parameter <i>k,</i> coding for stimulus scaling sensitivity, and parameter <i>B</i>, coding for distance-to-bound, could be differentiated in our model due to the insertion of the microstimulation signal in visual area V5/MT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

A microstimulation-reaction time task, or detailed measurement of neuronal firing rates in sensorimotor structures such as LIP that represent the integration stage, would be necessary to resolve this issue.

Further electrophysiological research should record in area LIP to show directly how the electrically introduced signal in V5/MT is integrated into the perceptual decision under different reward states, and should record in visual area V5/MT to show how reward modulates the signals of sensory evidence in visual cortex during perceptual decisions."

The dots had a sinusoidal velocity profile as would be expected in an orthographic projection of a three-dimensional rotating cylinder. When the two dot surfaces are presented at the same binocular disparity, the cylinder rotation direction is bistable and over time will undergo spontaneous fluctuations in the perceived direction of rotation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wallach and O'Connell, 1953</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Ullman, 1979</a>). Adding opposite horizontal disparity separates the front and back walls of the cylinder in depth, thereby disambiguating the direction of rotation. The disparity of each dot was scaled sinusoidally to match the velocity profile, with the maximal disparity difference between the two dot surfaces at the central axis of the cylinder. Equal but opposite disparities were added to the front and back surfaces of the cylinder, so that its principal axis remained in the plane of fixation. Below, we use the term \u2018disparity\u2019 to refer to this maximal difference in disparity between dots moving in opposite directions. We used the following convention: when the front wall of dots moved to the left with respect to cylinder orientation axis, this corresponded to a CW rotating cylinder as viewed from above; when the front wall moved to the right, this corresponded to a CCW rotating cylinder.

Reward size available for a correct choice on each trial depended upon the number of immediately preceding consecutive correct responses that the animal had made, increasing in two steps up to a maximum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Choices in zero-disparity trials were rewarded 50% of the time at random, and for the purposes of calculating the reward sequence they were discounted. For monkey Ica, reward size was 0.08 ml on the first and second consecutive correct choices after an error, 0.12 ml for the third consecutive correct choice, and 0.2 ml on the fourth and all subsequent consecutive correct trials. For monkey Fle, reward size was 1/3 of maximum for the first correct choice, 2/3 of maximum for the second, and reached maximum size (usually 0.18 ml) for the third and all subsequent consecutive correct choices. Thus reward size increased more quickly for Fle than Ica as a function of consecutive correct responses. For both animals, we categorized trials into two conditions: maximal (large) reward size and sub-maximal (small) reward size, where for both animals the average size of the two sub-maximal reward sizes was half that of the maximal reward size. Animals were familiar with their respective reward schedule because it was used throughout all training and recording sessions with the discrimination task; it was not introduced only for the microstimulation experiments."

The direction evoking the greatest response on average was assigned to be the PREF motion direction for the MU cluster. The RF boundaries were then mapped using a patch of dots moving in the PREF motion direction. After quantitative confirmation of direction tuning within these boundaries, the binocular disparity preference of the MU cluster was measured by presenting a plane of moving dots in the PREF direction at different binocular disparities around the fixation plane. Only MU sites with discernible motion and disparity tuning were further explored. The directions of motion of the two transparent planes of dots that made up the cylinder were aligned with the PREF and the opposite (NULL) directions of the MU cluster and the MU cylinder preference was calculated online over a range of disparities."

The size of the horizontal shift of the psychometric function induced by electrical microstimulation was re-calculated as described in the previous section, separately for large and small reward trials. To normalise the effect of microstimulation across sites with different associated threshold due to stimulus eccentricity (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), the horizontal shift of the psychometric function in each reward condition was divided by the psychometric threshold for that reward condition that is, the standard deviation (s.d.) of the fitted cumulative Gaussian (<a href=\"#equ1a\">Equation 1a</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Uka and DeAngelis 2006</a>). A Wilcoxon sign-rank test across sites (p &lt; 0.05, two-sided) was used to ascertain whether there was an overall significant difference in the size of the microstimulation shift between the large and small reward conditions. A non-parametric test was used because although the normalized shifts were normally distributed (Lilliefors test, p &gt; 0.05), the underlying distribution of raw shift values was not normally distributed (Lilliefors test, p = 0.001). We report uncorrected p values; however, all statistically significant results survive Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons across the two animals (where relevant)."

The \u2206dx control experiment comprised 12,149 trials in total, whilst the Fle and Ica electrical microstimulation experiments comprised 9,411 and 10,592 trials in total, respectively, over all microstimulation sites. Since our objective was to ascertain whether the animal learns to treat the \u2206dx trials differently from non-\u2206dx trials, we kept the direction of the \u2206dx signal the same throughout the control experiment. If the animal fails to adjust its criterion on a reward-size basis in this situation when it is clearly apparent when the additional visual disparity signal is added, it seems very unlikely that they could do so when the signal introduced by microstimulation varied between experiments (as it did for the real microstimulation)."

Differences between the \u0394dx control and the main data limit the value of this control for this concern. In other words, noisy or odd/aberrant inputs from sensory neurons (e.g. electrically evoked responses) might be weighed less compared to the more \u201cnormal\u201d inputs (e.g. visually evoked responses of non-stimulated MT neurons). These weights can then change based on expected reward or task engagement.

(2) Model this effect with the bounded accumulation model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), and indicate which parameters change. (3) Ask: how does reward influence perceptual sensitivity? One possibility is that it influences the stimulus representation itself, i.e. the responses of MT neurons. Another possibility is that it influences the weight that the decision mechanisms assign to MT responses. (4) See if we can rule out the first possibility by looking at the firing rate of MT neurons. Does it depend on reward? (5) Support the second possibility with the microstimulation data. Show the current <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a> (the red curves), with fits by the drift diffusion model (no need to show the same data twice as currently appear in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Show statistics to support the claim (e.g. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This is the key piece of evidence, and there is already sufficient level of analysis in the paper to support it.

If the reported reward effect on microstimulation in fact resulted from slower fluctuations in task engagement, with differential microstimulation effects associated with good and bad periods of task engagement, then the size of the reward effect should correlate with the amount of performance fluctuation, i.e. when there is little or no fluctuation, there should be little or no modulation of the microstimulation effect by trial-by-trial reward size. However, we found no correlation between reward effect and performance fluctuation for either animal considered separately or together (p &gt;&gt; 0.05 in all cases).

The reward effect on microstimulation shift remained within both the good and the bad epochs (p &lt; 0.05).

Trials with this additional disparity \u2013 disparity that had to be discounted for maximal reward \u2013 were clearly signalled by a change in colour of the cylinder stimulus from black to white.

We have now acknowledged this issue earlier in the paper (in the subsection \u201cLarge reward trials are associated with better performance\u201d). If there is no trial-by-trial modulation of performance by available reward size, and no longer-term fluctuations between higher and lower performance states through the session, then even under our experimental design there should be no association between improved performance and large available reward trials. This is because we separated trials according to the size of reward available for a correct choice, rather than whether or not reward was actually delivered (which would only be for correct choices and so by definition would entail perfect performance). If, however, there are fluctuations between good and bad performance states (epochs) throughout the session, then, as pointed out in point 1, there would be an automatic association between better performance and large reward trials, which occur more frequently in the high performance epochs than low performance epochs, as a consequence of our experimental design. (NB. Even then, this would not necessarily entail the main results of our study, i.e. it would not entail that either performance or expected reward size \u2013 or some weighted combination of the two \u2013 must necessarily affect the effect of microstimulation)."
