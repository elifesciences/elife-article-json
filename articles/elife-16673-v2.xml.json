In the first phase of this pathway, ten Fe/S cluster (ISC) assembly components synthesize and insert [2Fe-2S] clusters. The second phase is dedicated to the assembly of [4Fe-4S] proteins, yet this part is poorly understood. Here, we characterize the BOLA family proteins Bol1 and Bol3 as specific mitochondrial ISC assembly factors that facilitate [4Fe-4S] cluster insertion into a subset of mitochondrial proteins such as lipoate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase. Bol1-Bol3 perform largely overlapping functions, yet cannot replace the ISC protein Nfu1 that also participates in this phase of Fe/S protein biogenesis. Bol1 and Bol3 form dimeric complexes with both monothiol glutaredoxin Grx5 and Nfu1. Complex formation differentially influences the stability of the Grx5-Bol-shared Fe/S clusters. Our findings provide the biochemical basis for explaining the pathological phenotypes of patients with mutations in <i>BOLA3</i>."

In the first phase of this pathway, ten Fe/S cluster (ISC) assembly components synthesize and insert [2Fe-2S] clusters. The second phase is dedicated to the assembly of [4Fe-4S] proteins, yet this part is poorly understood. Here, we characterize the BOLA family proteins Bol1 and Bol3 as specific mitochondrial ISC assembly factors that facilitate [4Fe-4S] cluster insertion into a subset of mitochondrial proteins such as lipoate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase. Bol1-Bol3 perform largely overlapping functions, yet cannot replace the ISC protein Nfu1 that also participates in this phase of Fe/S protein biogenesis. Bol1 and Bol3 form dimeric complexes with both monothiol glutaredoxin Grx5 and Nfu1. Complex formation differentially influences the stability of the Grx5-Bol-shared Fe/S clusters. Our findings provide the biochemical basis for explaining the pathological phenotypes of patients with mutations in <i>BOLA3</i>."

Genetic defects in these pathways are associated with a spectrum of diverse mitochondriopathies with neurological, neurodegenerative, hematological, and metabolic phenotypes. Knowledge of the molecular deficits of the affected mitochondrial components is key for the development of a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial diseases. A mutation in human <i>BOLA3</i> encoding a mitochondrial protein is associated with diverse defects summarized as multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome 2 (MMDS2; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cameron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haack et al., 2013</a>). In particular, BOLA3 deficiency results in decreased functions of respiratory complexes I and II as well as lipoic acid-dependent enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), and glycine cleavage system (GCS) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mayr et al., 2014</a>). BOLA3 was suggested to play a role in mitochondrial Fe/S protein biogenesis because of similar clinical and biochemical phenotypes in patients with mutations in the known ISC factors <i>NFU1</i> (causing MMDS1; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cameron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Invernizzi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</a>) and <i>IBA57</i> (causing MMDS3; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ajit Bolar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lossos et al., 2015</a>; for review see <a href=\"#bib7\">Beilschmidt and Puccio, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Stehling et al., 2014</a>). Another link for BOLA3 to mitochondrial Fe/S protein biogenesis is provided by the fact that related bacterial and plant Bol proteins interact with monothiol glutaredoxins, factors that play a critical role in Fe/S protein biogenesis [<a href=\"#bib8\">Boutigny et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Roret et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yeung et al., 2011</a>]).

Eukaryotes such as yeast and humans possess three BOLA family members that can be discriminated by conserved sequence elements (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To date, the precise function of the BOLA proteins and the functional relationship between the three eukaryotic BOLA family members is unclear. Yeast Bol2 (formerly termed Fra2; [<a href=\"#bib34\">Kumanovics et al., 2008</a>]) is cytosolic, and is involved in cellular iron regulation by forming heterodimeric, [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing complexes with the cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3-Grx4 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2010</a>). The human relative BOLA2 also forms hetero-complexes with human GRX3 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Banci et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2012</a>), yet the exact physiological role of the Bol2 proteins is still poorly defined. Additionally to BOLA3, human mitochondria contain the homologous BOLA1 (<a href=\"#bib75\">Willems et al., 2013</a>). Ablation of <i>BOLA1</i> in cultured human cells increases mitochondrial protein thiol oxidation and elicits alterations in mitochondrial morphology. BOLA1 (but not BOLA3) co-purified with tagged mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5 that is crucial for Fe/S protein biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib75\">Willems et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Ye et al., 2010</a>). Both BOLA1 and BOLA3 have structural counterparts in many eukaryotes including yeast Bol1 and Bol3, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Apart from the <i>BOLA3</i> patient cell analysis, no solid evidence for a direct role of the BOLA family proteins in cellular Fe/S protein metabolism has been described. We therefore sought to better define the physiological role of the mitochondrial Bol1-Bol3 (mBols) and cytosolic Bol2 proteins in this essential biosynthetic pathway by using the yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i> as a model organism (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beilschmidt and Puccio, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lill, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lill et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Netz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rouault, 2012</a>)."

The pathway can be divided into two major phases. First, components of the \u2018core ISC machinery\u2019 including the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 and the scaffold protein Isu1 synthesize a [2Fe-2S] cluster, and transfer it transiently to the monothiol glutaredoxin Grx5 for subsequent assembly of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins. Second, dedicated ISC factors use the Grx5-bound Fe/S cluster to assemble a [4Fe-4S] cluster and to facilitate its insertion into mitochondrial apoproteins such as aconitase, respiratory complexes, and the radical SAM Fe/S protein lipoic acid synthase (LIAS). Even though the molecular mechanisms of this late phase of Fe/S protein biogenesis are poorly resolved, recent studies have shown that the Isa1, Isa2 and Iba57 proteins cooperate to generate a [4Fe-4S] cluster (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brancaccio et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gelling et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sheftel et al., 2012</a>). Its insertion into specific target apoproteins is subsequently facilitated by Nfu1 and the P-loop ATPase Ind1, both transiently binding [4Fe-4S] clusters (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bych et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sheftel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tong et al., 2003</a>).

This striking difference for phases I and II is explained by the central, additional role of the core ISC machinery in both cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis and cellular iron regulation. Functional defects of core ISC factors lead to impaired assembly of essential Fe/S proteins such as nuclear DNA polymerases and helicases (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gari et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Netz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Stehling et al., 2012</a>) and an induction of the yeast iron regulon involving the above mentioned Bol2 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lill et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Outten and Albetel, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Paul and Lill, 2015</a>).

Upon sub-fractionation of mitochondria by hypotonic swelling or detergent lysis, the Bol proteins behaved similar to the matrix proteins Tim44 and Mge1 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

                                "text": "Single deletions of <i>BOL1</i> or <i>BOL3</i> did not affect any of these enzyme activities relative to wild-type cells with the exception of a slight, but significant decrease of SDH in <i>bol3\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E</a>, bars 1\u20133). In contrast, double <i>BOL1-BOL3</i> deletions resulted in substantial, up to threefold decreases of the Fe/S cluster-dependent enzyme activities, an effect comparable to that seen for <i>nfu1\u0394</i> cells (bars 4 and 6) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</a>). A notable exception was aconitase which retained normal activity in <i>bol13\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, double but not single yeast <i>BOL</i> gene deletions created a similar phenotype as that observed in <i>BOLA3</i> patient cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cameron et al., 2011</a>). Additional ablation of <i>BOL2</i> (strain <i>bol123\u0394</i>, bar 5) did not substantially exacerbate these effects suggesting that the mitochondrial and cytosolic Bol proteins act independently. The decrease in SDH was likely due to a direct defect in Fe/S cluster assembly, because SDH protein levels remained unchanged in immunoblots (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In keeping with the decreased PDH and KGDH activities, we also found a lipoylation defect of the E2 subunits of these enzymes by immunostaining against lipoic acid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gelling et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Schonauer et al., 2009</a>). All the observed effects were rather mild in comparison to defects reported for deletion mutants of other late-acting ISC factors such as Isa1, Isa2, and Iba57 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gelling et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2011</a>). This notion was also evident from the lack of any effects on COX activity in all tested <i>BOL</i> deletion strains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). A severe COX diminution is observed in <i>ISA1, ISA2,</i> or <i>IBA57</i> mutants, yet the exact reason is unknown (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gelling et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2011</a>). In order to verify that the loss of the enzyme activities was specific, <i>BOL1</i> and <i>BOL3</i> genes were reintroduced into the <i>bol123\u0394</i> deletion strain by expression from plasmids. Both Bol1 and Bol3 were able to efficiently rescue the deficiencies in SDH activities (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Both aconitase and SDH activities of the various <i>BOL</i> deletion strains behaved similarly after growth in lactate- compared to galactose-containing media (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In contrast, PDH and KGDH activities were much more severely (ten- vs. threefold) diminished in <i>bol13\u0394, bol123\u0394</i>, and <i>nfu1\u0394</i> cells grown in lactate medium, similar to previous reports on Isa protein depletion (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kaut et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2011</a>). Together, these data show that the mBols were crucial for efficient maturation of LIAS, yet they play only an auxiliary role in SDH maturation. The levels of Bol1 and Nfu1 did not change or rather slightly decreased in the various deletion cells making a compensatory effect unlikely (data not shown; Bol3 levels could not be tested due to the lack of antibody detection). Obviously, Bol1 and Bol3 perform largely complementary roles, because only simultaneous deletion of both <i>BOL1-BOL3</i> genes created a significant LIAS defect."

Compared to other ISC gene deletions (see, e.g., <a href=\"#bib16\">Gelling et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerber et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rodriguez-Manzaneque et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Voisine et al., 2001</a>) this effect was rather weak. Similar, yet slightly stronger decreases in <sup>55</sup>Fe binding (60%) were detected for mitochondria-targeted HiPIP, a bacterial [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing ferredoxin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). For all the tested Fe/S proteins, single deletion of <i>BOL1</i> had no effects on <sup>55</sup>Fe binding. The observed defects were specific, because reintroduction of Bol1 or Bol3 into the <i>bol123\u0394</i> strain via overproducing vectors completely restored wild-type <sup>55</sup>Fe binding activity, whereas cytosolic Bol2 or Grx5, as a control, were ineffective (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Taken together, these data support a specific function of the mBols in the maturation of a subset of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, whereby Bol1 and Bol3 perform largely overlapping, non-essential functions. Interestingly, the <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling assay revealed a slightly more important role for Bol3 as compared to Bol1. This tendency, yet less well pronounced, was also observed for the enzyme activities (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The ability of the mBols to mutually substitute each other explains why Fe/S protein defects are best visible when both <i>BOL1</i> and <i>BOL3</i> are deleted."

First, we measured the consequences of various <i>BOL</i> gene deletions on the activation of the Aft1-Aft2-dependent iron regulon, a hallmark of all cells with defects in the core ISC machinery (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lill et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Outten and Albetel, 2013</a>). As expected (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kumanovics et al., 2008</a>), <i>bol2\u0394</i> cells displayed a substantial activation of the Aft1-dependent <i>FIT3</i> and <i>FET3</i> genes in a GFP-based promoter assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). In contrast, yeast strains lacking <i>BOL1</i> and/or <i>BOL3</i> behaved like wild-type cells indicating that the mBols are not involved in cellular iron regulation.

                                "text": "Second, we investigated the effects of the three <i>BOL</i> gene deletions on cytosolic Fe/S proteins by assaying the enzyme activity of isopropylmalate isomerase (Leu1). No changes were observed when <i>BOL1-BOL3</i> genes were deleted either alone or in combination (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In contrast, <i>bol2\u0394</i> cells showed a twofold decrease in Leu1 activity, which further declined upon additional deletion of <i>BOL1-BOL3</i>. Collectively, these results show that the mBols are not involved in cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis, yet there is a cross-talk of the mBol deficiency with the <i>BOL2</i> deletion. To better understand the reason of this combinatory effect, we took advantage of the <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling assay described above. Deletion of either <i>BOL1-BOL3</i> or <i>BOL2</i> hardly affected <sup>55</sup>Fe/S cluster binding to Leu1 indicating that neither mitochondrial Bol1-Bol3 nor cytosolic Bol2 perform a decisive role in Leu1 Fe/S cluster incorporation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). However, combining the <i>BOL2</i> deletion with that of <i>BOL1</i> and/or <i>BOL3</i> resulted in an up to twofold decrease in <sup>55</sup>Fe/S cluster association with Leu1. A similar twofold decrease (compared to wild-type) was seen for <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporation into another cytosolic Fe/S protein, the ABC protein Rli1 using the triple <i>BOL</i> deletion strain <i>bol123\u0394</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>). We note, however, that these decreases in <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporation were rather weak compared to defects in core ISC or CIA components (see, e.g., <a href=\"#bib50\">Netz et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Paul et al., 2015</a>). The Rli1 maturation defect was completely restored when any of the <i>BOL</i> genes was reintroduced into the <i>bol123\u0394</i> mutant. This supports the notion that neither the mBols nor Bol2 are directly involved in cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation. Obviously, their combined absence causes alterations in both mitochondrial metabolism and cellular iron homeostasis, thereby creating conditions that negatively affect cytosolic Fe/S cluster insertion. The physiological conditions prevailing in <i>bol123\u0394</i> cells might also explain the slight decrease in the enzyme activity of aconitase which, like Leu1, is a highly susceptible protein to, e.g., oxidative stress conditions or changes in iron availability (cf. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3C</a>). Together, our data indicate that the mBols execute a mitochondria-specific function in [4Fe-4S] protein assembly, whereas Bol2 plays a specific role in cellular iron regulation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kumanovics et al., 2008</a>)."

The <i>BOL3</i> effect was not further amplified in <i>nfu1\u0394bol13\u0394</i> cells. These findings show that Bol3 plays a distinct, Nfu1-independent role that cannot be executed by Bol1.

A weak complementation was seen for <i>bol13\u0394</i> cells by <i>NFU1</i> expression (part B). Notably, this slight rescue effect was not observed for growth on solid acetate medium (not shown). Further, we used these cells for measuring the enzyme activities of aconitase, SDH, PDH and KGDH. In agreement with the growth behavior, Bol3 was not able to rescue any of the enzyme defects of <i>nfu1\u0394</i> cells, while Nfu1 did so (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013F</a>, left). Likewise, Nfu1 failed to restore the enzyme activities of <i>bol13\u0394</i> cells, while Bol3 was complementing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013F</a>, right). These findings show that Nfu1 and Bol3 cannot mutually substitute each other\u2019s biochemical function, even upon overproduction. Despite the fact that Bol3 and Nfu1 both act late in mitochondrial Fe/S protein biogenesis, they appear to fulfil different tasks that cannot be taken over by the other protein. Hence, these data suggest that Bol1-Bol3 and Nfu1 perform individual, non-overlapping functions during Fe/S cluster assembly."

                                "text": "To extend our cell biological insights into Bol protein function, we employed NMR structural studies to examine their physical interaction with Grx5. We used the human proteins for these in vitro studies because they were more stable than the yeast counterparts. First, the solution structures of human BOLA1 and BOLA3 were determined (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). A detailed description of the two structures and of their backbone dynamic properties is provided in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. According to the DALI server (<a href=\"#bib26\">Holm and Sander, 1993</a>), both BOLA1 and BOLA3 show the highest structural similarity to BolA-like proteins from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana, Babesia bovis</i>, and <i>Mus musculus</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abendroth et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kasai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Roret et al., 2014</a>). In particular, the BOLA1 structure matches better with those homologues that have a longer loop between \u03b21 and \u03b22, while the BOLA3 structure is more similar to homologues having a shorter \u03b21-\u03b22 loop (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Apparently, the structural features of the loop between \u03b21 and \u03b22 are key for differentiating BOLA1 from BOLA3. Remarkably, this loop is closer to the \u2018invariant\u2019 His residue (His102 in BOLA1 and His96 in BOLA3; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), which has been shown to coordinate the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the yeast Bol2-Grx3 complex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2011</a>). This region contains further possible Fe/S cluster ligands, namely His58, His67 in BOLA1 and Cys59 in BOLA3. Another conserved His residue (His86 in BOLA1 and His81 in BOLA3) is distant from this region and thus excluded as a cluster ligand (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Together, structural data indicate that BOLA1 and BOLA3 have a similar fold, but show local structural differences in the regions containing the potential Fe/S cluster ligands."

The proteins were in buffer N with 10% (v/v) D<sub>2</sub>O). The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of the apo forms of BOLA3 and BOLA1 showed well-dispersed resonances indicative of essentially folded proteins. The overall topology of the solution structure of human BOLA3 is \u03b11\u03b21\u03b22\u03b71\u03b12\u03b72\u03b23 (h: 3<sub>10</sub>-helix), in which \u03b21 and \u03b22 are antiparallel, and \u03b23 is parallel to \u03b22 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). All \u03b1-helices are on the same side of the \u03b2-sheet and the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix located between \u03b12 and \u03b23 contains the His96 residue that is invariant in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic BolA homologues (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li and Outten, 2012</a>). A cysteine residue (Cys59), typically conserved in Bol3 homologues, is located close to the invariant His96 residue in an extended loop between \u03b21 and \u03b22. The two residues are not in the proper orientation to coordinate a [2Fe-2S] cluster (S\u03b3 of Cys59 is at an average distance of ~8 \u00c5 from N\u03b52 of His96). The overall topology of the solution structure of BOLA1 is similar to that of BOLA3, with the exception of the presence, in BOLA1, of short helices in the loop regions and at the C-terminus (\u03b11\u03b71\u03b21\u03b22\u03b72\u03b12\u03b13\u03b23\u03b14 topology) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In addition, at both termini BOLA1 has ca. 15 residues that are unstructured and whose backbone NH resonances are clustered in the central region of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum (part B). The three His residues typically conserved in Bol1 homologues are located in two spatially close regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Although they are close to each other, it is not possible to predict which ones may be involved in [2Fe-2S] cluster coordination. Information on backbone motions and on the protein oligomerization state of BOLA1 and BOLA3 were obtained through <sup>15</sup>N <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, heteronuclear <sup>15</sup>N(<sup>1</sup>H)-NOEs NMR experiments. The <sup>15</sup>N backbone relaxation properties showed that the N and C termini of BOLA1 are highly flexible, as about 15 to 20 residues on each terminus have negative <sup>15</sup>N NOE values, while the folded domain is essentially rigid. BOLA3 is a rigid molecule, with the exception of the first detected residue at the N terminus, the last two residues at the C terminus and residues around invariant His96. All of them experience fast backbone motions in the ns-ps time scale, as indicated by their low or negative <sup>15</sup>N NOE values."

For instance, the invariant His66 region of AtBolA2 does not appear to be an interaction interface, at variance with what we observed for both human BOLA complexes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). In addition, the GrxS14-interacting regions include the two C-terminal \u03b14 and \u03b15 helices, whereas helix \u03b15 of GLRX5 of both human complexes did not show chemical shifts, and a different segment of helix \u03b14 was involved.

A similar comparison for the <sup>15</sup>N-labeled BOLA1-GLRX5 complex showed that the region around His67 of BOLA1 (structurally close to Cys59 of BOLA3) exhibited similar chemical shift changes, even though fewer residues were affected in BOLA1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, left parts). The chemical shift perturbation analysis for <sup>15</sup>N-labeled GLRX5 revealed that the residues of GLRX5 involved in the apo interaction are also affected in the holo-complex and that the conserved Cys67 of GLRX5 was additionally altered in the holo complexes only (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, two other adjacent GLRX5 residues (Lys59 for BOLA3 and Gly60 for BOLA1 interaction) were altered that are part of the GSH binding site. The regions of GLRX5 affected by the interaction with BOLA1 and BOLA3 are essentially the same as those in the [2Fe-2S]<sup>2+</sup> GLRX5 homodimer (<a href=\"#bib5\">Banci et al., 2014</a>).

GLRX5 and stoichiometric amounts of BOLA1 or BOLA3 were chemically co-reconstituted with a [2Fe-2S] cluster and analyzed by CD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Similar results were obtained when GLRX5 was reconstituted first and then the BOLA proteins were added (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The CD spectrum of GLRX5-BOLA1 characteristically differed from that of holo-GLRX5 in a positive versus negative ellipticity around 400 nm with a 6 nm blue shift and 40% decrease of the ~460 nm peak with a 6 nm red shift (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). These spectral changes saturated at an equimolar ratio of holo-GLRX5 and BOLA1 suggesting a high affinity equimolar hetero-complex formation with a shared [2Fe-2S] cluster (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The cluster coordinated by the GLRX5-BOLA1 hetero-dimer was stable against reduction by dithionite creating a CD spectrum in which the peak at 460 nm was maintained but that at 400 nm was lost. In contrast, the cluster of holo-GLRX5 was destroyed upon dithionite treatment with no residual CD peaks (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Further, the Fe/S cluster was not protected against destruction by dithionite treatment indicating rather different coordination situations for the [2Fe-2S] clusters in the two GLRX5-BOLA heterodimers. These results are consistent with the different NMR chemical shift changes in the putative Fe/S cluster binding regions of the two BOLAs in the hetero-complexes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). They do not explain, however, why NMR still detected holo-specific changes in the putative cluster-binding region of the BOLA3 hetero-complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Since the NMR data were recorded in GSH-containing buffer at lower pH, we repeated the CD analysis under NMR buffer conditions. We found a general decrease of the CD peaks upon GLRX5-BOLA3 hetero-complex formation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). These changes mainly depended on the presence of GSH, and not salt or pH (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). In all cases, the CD signal decrease did not reach saturation even after addition of a more than tenfold molar excess of BOLA3 over holo-GLRX5. This result indicated a rather low affinity for this interference of BOLA3 with the [2Fe-2S] cluster.

                        "text": "In this work, we have defined the molecular function of the mitochondrial Bol1 and Bol3 proteins (mBols) as specific ISC assembly factors required for the insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into a small subset of mitochondrial target apoproteins. The two mBols act late in the ISC pathway, and execute a largely overlapping function, because only simultaneous deletion of both <i>BOL</i> genes was associated with appreciable effects on mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] target proteins (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Lipoic acid synthase (LIAS) with its two [4Fe-4S] clusters is the primary client of mBol function because of strong effects on lipoic acid-dependent proteins (such as PDH and KGDH) in <i>bol13\u0394</i> cells. These severe effects were observed under all experimental conditions tested, unlike the comparatively weak effects on SDH (complex II) which typically is one of the more sensitive mitochondrial Fe/S proteins upon ISC factor defects. Therefore, we cannot exclude an indirect effect of the <i>BOL</i> gene deletion on SDH maturation. The [4Fe-4S] aconitase, on the other hand, was not or hardly affected in <i>bol13\u0394</i> cells distinguishing the <i>BOL</i> deletion phenotype from that of all other known ISC genes, with the exception of the complex I-specific <i>IND1</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bych et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sheftel et al., 2009</a>). We propose that the rather inconspicuous effects on aconitase are indirect consequences of the metabolic and respiratory alterations arising from lipoic acid-dependent enzyme defects which mainly affect the citric acid cycle (PDH and KGDH) and the amino acid metabolism (BCKDH, GCS; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The functions of the mBols are largely overlapping, yet not entirely identical. This was evident from small effects on LIAS and SDH in <i>bol3\u0394</i> cells, versus no detectable alterations upon <i>BOL1</i> deletion. Moreover, double deletion of <i>BOL3</i> and <i>NFU1</i>, encoding another late-acting ISC factor (<a href=\"#bib48\">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</a>), (<a href=\"#bib43\">Melber et al., 2016</a>; accompanying manuscript), exacerbated the Fe/S protein defects compared to single deletions, while double deletion of <i>BOL1</i> and <i>NFU1</i> behaved similarly to <i>nfu1\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Two models may explain the largely complementary functions of the two mBols. i) The mBols assist the same biochemical reaction. In this case, the subtle differences between <i>bol1\u0394</i> and <i>bol3\u0394</i> strains may be due to minor target apoprotein specificities of the two mBols or the different protein interactions with Grx5 and Nfu1. ii) The mBols act consecutively in two independent maturation steps that both can be bypassed to some extent. Even though we biochemically favor the first possibility, current knowledge does not allow a more precise mechanistic definition of mBol function. Taken together, the major evident physiological function of the yeast mBol proteins is in lipoate synthase maturation. A similar defect is seen in human cells obtained from <i>BOLA3</i> patients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cameron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haack et al., 2013</a>). This phenotypical resemblance suggests that the yeast mBols and at least human BOLA3 are functionally similar. Even though yeast appears to be a suitable model system for the physiological and mechanistic investigation of mBols, the two human BOLAs now need to be studied in cell culture to gain better insights into their relative function."

With the help of ISCA1, ISCA2, and IBA57, the GLRX5-bound [2Fe-2S] cluster is converted into a [4Fe-4S] type. BOLA1 and BOLA3 together with NFU1 and IND1 function in a\u00a0specific assembly of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins as indicated. The central target of the BOLA proteins is the Fe/S protein lipoic acid (LA) synthase (LIAS). Its product is used as a cofactor of five mitochondrial enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH). Based on the hetero-complex formation with the BOLA proteins an additional function of GLRX5 in this late phase of mitochondrial Fe/S protein assembly is likely.

First, the mBols were not required for maturation of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins or cytosolic Fe/S proteins. Second, their deletion did not affect the yeast cellular iron regulon. These criteria distinguish the mBol phenotype from that of the\u00a0components of the core ISC machinery including Grx5, that\u00a0is the final core ISC factor (<a href=\"#bib72\">Uzarska et al., 2013</a>), and suggest that mBols act subsequently to Grx5. This view is further corroborated by our finding that, third, <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporation into Grx5 occurred independently of mBols. Finally, the function of the mBols must be after the involvement of Isa-Iba57 proteins in the [4Fe-4S] cluster formation, because the mBols exhibit high [4Fe-4S] target specificity. In Isa-Iba57-defective cells, all mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins and the non-Fe/S protein cytochrome oxidase are severely affected, unlike in <i>bol13\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sheftel et al., 2012</a>).

It is well possible that the Grx5-mBol complexes play a role at the later stage of Fe/S cluster insertion into apoproteins. This seems likely based on interaction between BOLA1 and GLRX5 observed in human cells (<a href=\"#bib75\">Willems et al., 2013</a>), and similar interactions reported in the accompanying manuscript (<a href=\"#bib43\">Melber et al., 2016</a>).

Human GLRX5 interacted with both mBols, stoichiometrically forming a 1:1 complex both in the apo- and chemically reconstituted holo-forms, involving similar regions on the three proteins as revealed by NMR studies. However, for the holo-forms, further residues were affected, and were clustered around the region containing the invariant histidine (His102 in BOLA1 and His96 in BOLA3; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>), which in cytosolic Bol2 is a ligand for Fe/S cluster binding with Grx3-Grx4 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2011</a>). These Bol regions include other potential cluster ligands, which are two His residues in BOLA1, located at the end of \u03b22 and in the loop between \u03b21 and \u03b22, and one Cys in BOLA3, located in the loop between \u03b21 and \u03b22. CD spectroscopy revealed striking differences in Fe/S cluster binding to the two holo-GLRX5-BOLA complexes. Compared to holo-GLRX5, the holo-GLRX5-BOLA1 complex showed characteristic new spectral features including a new peak at ~400 nm. GLRX5 and BOLA1 coordinate the [2Fe-2S] cluster with high affinity. The spectral features of the complex were rather insensitive to changes in ionic conditions or to the presence of additional GSH. Most characteristically, the [2Fe-2S] cluster of GLRX5 was stabilized by BOLA1 binding against destruction by the reductant dithionite indicating a stable holo-GLRX5-BOLA1 complex."

First, the CD spectral features of the holo-GLRX5-BOLA3 complex differed from those of holo-GLRX5 by a general signal decrease, and were observed mainly in the presence of GSH suggesting that without added GSH the GLRX5 cluster is not shared with BOLA3. Second, the spectral changes induced by BOLA3 addition to holo-GLRX5 were not saturable indicating a rather weak influence of BOLA3 on the GLRX5 Fe/S cluster. Third, the CD signals became rather weak at high BOLA3 or salt concentrations. Finally, dithionite readily destroyed the [2Fe-2S] cluster of GLRX5 in the presence and absence of BOLA3. In support of this data, gel filtration did not identify a stable complex between holo-GLRX5 and BOLA3 indicating that their interaction is kinetically labile, and a hetero-dimer may dissociate during the non-equilibrium method. All these findings document radically different Fe/S cluster binding properties of the two GLXR5-BOLA complexes with BOLA1 stabilizing and BOLA3 destabilizing the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Interestingly, we found a preferential interaction of BOLA3 with the holoform of NFU1 by thermophoresis. These data suggest that BOLA3 may stabilize the [4Fe-4S] cluster bound on NFU1. A specific genetic interaction of <i>NFU1</i> and <i>BOL3</i> supports our biochemical findings. Double deletion of these genes exacerbated the defects of SDH and LIAS, whereas simultaneous deletions of <i>NFU1</i> and <i>BOL1</i> did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). This suggests that Bol3 and Nfu1 cooperate in SDH and LIAS maturation.

Interestingly, a combination of these gene deletions with <i>BOL2</i> elicited significant effects, even though these were rather weak compared to known core ISC or CIA deficiencies (see, e.g., <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerber et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hausmann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Netz et al., 2010</a>). The defects, especially in the triple deletion mutant <i>bol123\u0394</i>, are therefore best explained by combined detrimental effects of mitochondrial respiratory and metabolic changes arising from the <i>BOL1-BOL3</i> deletion (see above) and the disturbed cellular iron homeostasis resulting from <i>BOL2</i> ablation. Single <i>BOL2</i> deletion is not associated with major phenotypes apart from iron homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kumanovics et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This is clearly different from the usual lethality of CIA gene deletions (<a href=\"#bib49\">Netz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Paul and Lill, 2015</a>), and fits well with the rather weak or even inconspicuous effects of a <i>BOL2</i> deletion on the maturation of the cytosolic Fe/S proteins Leu1 and Rli1. Any slight effects are most likely due to the auxiliary role of Bol2 in iron metabolism (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kumanovics et al., 2008</a>). In this function, Bol2 cooperates with Grx3-Grx4 (human PICOT) which, in its role in cellular iron mobilization, is essential for cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Banci et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Haunhorst et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "Our comprehensive physiological investigations of mBol function in yeast reveal that <i>bol13\u0394</i> cells behave similarly to human patients deficient in BOLA3 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cameron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haack et al., 2013</a>). Patients with the resulting multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome 2 (MMDS 2) show major defects in lipoic acid-dependent enzymes, similar to the most severe effect observed in <i>bol13\u0394</i> yeast. Moreover, the patient cells are deficient in respiratory complexes I and II, the latter also being affected in yeast. We conclude that the mBol protein function is conserved from yeast to man with a major role in [4Fe-4S] cluster insertion into LIAS and respiratory complexes I and II, whereas Fe/S proteins such as aconitase are matured independently of mBol function. The conclusion of similar mBol functions in yeast and man may be surprising based on the rather inconspicuous yeast deletion phenotypes versus the lethal effect in BOLA3-deficient individuals. This difference may simply reflect the higher complexity of a multi-cellular organism and its dependence on respiration and metabolic homeostasis, whereas yeast can tolerate substantial deviations from optimal conditions. Notably, RNAi-mediated depletion of BOLA1 was associated with rather mild effects (<a href=\"#bib75\">Willems et al., 2013</a>) predicting that the combination with a BOLA3 depletion may create a more pathological phenotype mimicking that of human patients and of <i>bol13\u0394</i> yeast cells. Our elucidation of the target apoprotein-specific ISC assembly function of mBols will be instrumental for future mechanistic studies on how the mBols facilitate the insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into LIAS and possibly other Fe/S proteins. These studies will also have to reveal why other Fe/S proteins such as aconitase are matured efficiently in the absence of these specialized ISC assembly factors."

We have already shown in the previous version of our manuscript (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013F</a>) that Nfu1 overexpression cannot compensate for Bol1,3, and Bol3 does not for Nfu1. The same is true for overexpressed Grx5 that cannot compensate for the mBols (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). As a further analysis into this direction and as suggested by the Reviewers, we now have analyzed the levels of Bol1, Bol3 (see legend to <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a>), and Nfu1 in the various yeast deletion cells to check the levels of the residual proteins. As seen in <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a>, we do not find major compensatory changes for these ISC proteins. The level of Bol1 in <i>bol3\u0394</i> cells is even lower. Hence, we find it highly unlikely that compensatory effects may explain the synthetic phenotype of <i>BOL1,3</i> deletions, or the generally rather weak effects of the deletion of the late-acting <i>ISC</i> genes. We now mention this finding in the Results in our revised manuscript. We also emphasize that the weak effects of late ISC protein deficiencies are easily explained by their rather specific requirement for maturation of only a small subset of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins (Discussion)."

The subtle differences between the <i>bol1\u0394</i> (no phenotypes) and <i>bol3\u0394</i> (occasional weak phenotypes) strains may then be due to minor target apoprotein specificities of the two Bol proteins or the different protein interactions as mentioned by the Reviewers. We emphasize, however, that we have no phenotypical evidence that the Bol protein complexes have an in vivorelevance. ii) The Bol proteins act consecutively in two independent maturation steps that both can be bypassed to some extent. Even though we find the second possibility biochemically less attractive, it is hard at this stage of analysis to more precisely define the specific molecular function of the Bol proteins. To better explain our interpretation of the relative function of Bol1-Bol3, we have improved our Discussion (first paragraph), and hope this point is much clearer now."

Protein levels in yeast are available from systematic studies (see the SGD website <a href=\"http://www.yeastgenome.org/\">http://www.yeastgenome.org/</a>). 10-fold lower amounts of Bol1 and Bol3 were found compared to Nfu1 and Grx5 (two tables were provided for the reviewers\u2019 consideration). However, these data sets may be of limited use, because the protein values differ more than tenfold between the different published data sets. Even after normalization to one protein (e.g., Nfs1) the relative protein levels in the different data sets differ substantially. Thus, we cannot rely on published numbers. We therefore have quantitated the levels of Bol1, Bol3, and Grx5 as suggested by the reviewers (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 2</a>). The analysis shows that Grx5 is (at least) 4-fold more abundant than the Bol proteins. From immunoblots we know that overexpression usually generates 10-20-fold higher levels. However, as discussed above from the analysis of protein levels in various deletions strains, the mere protein level increases do not have major effects on the phenotypes studied in our investigation. We have discussed this issue briefly. An analysis for Nfu1 was not feasible because we could not obtain purified yeast Nfu1."

Mitochondrial proteins and the indicated amounts of purified (<b>A</b>) Bol1, (<b>B</b>) Bol3, and (<b>C</b>) Grx5 were analyzed by immunostaining with specific antibodies. Densitometry of the bands was used to calculate the proteins levels (in ng per mg mitochondria). Since our antibody did not detect wild-type amounts of Bol3 in mitochondria (<b>B</b>), only an upper limit of Bol3 could be calculated. The different gel mobility of purified and mitochondrial Bol1 and Grx5 is explained by a His-tag on purified proteins."

But this is not at all clear as one is reading through the manuscript. It would be very helpful to the reader if this be addressed directly up front at the beginning of the manuscript.

We thank the reviewers for pointing out this didactic short-coming."
