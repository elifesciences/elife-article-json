                    "text": "<i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, the cause of potato late blight, is infamous for having triggered the Irish Great Famine in the 1840s. Until the late 1970s, <i>P. infestans</i> diversity outside of its Mexican center of origin was low, and one scenario held that a single strain, US-1, had dominated the global population for 150 years; this was later challenged based on DNA analysis of historical herbarium specimens. We have compared the genomes of 11 herbarium and 15 modern strains. We conclude that the 19th century epidemic was caused by a unique genotype, HERB-1, that persisted for over 50 years. HERB-1 is distinct from all examined modern strains, but it is a close relative of US-1, which replaced it outside of Mexico in the 20th century. We propose that HERB-1 and US-1 emerged from a metapopulation that was established in the early 1800s outside of the species' center of diversity."

Until the late 1970s, <i>P. infestans</i> diversity outside of its Mexican center of origin was low, and one scenario held that a single strain, US-1, had dominated the global population for 150 years; this was later challenged based on DNA analysis of historical herbarium specimens. We have compared the genomes of 11 herbarium and 15 modern strains. We conclude that the 19th century epidemic was caused by a unique genotype, HERB-1, that persisted for over 50 years. HERB-1 is distinct from all examined modern strains, but it is a close relative of US-1, which replaced it outside of Mexico in the 20th century. We propose that HERB-1 and US-1 emerged from a metapopulation that was established in the early 1800s outside of the species' center of diversity."

The Spanish introduced Europeans to the South American staple crop potato shortly after their conquest of the New World, but for three centuries Europe stayed free of <i>P. infestans</i>, the causal agent of late blight. In 1845, the oomycete <i>P. infestans</i> finally reached Europe, spreading rapidly from Belgium to other countries of mainland Europe and then to Great Britain and Ireland. The impact of the epidemic reached catastrophic levels in Ireland, where the population was more dependent on potato for their subsistence than in other parts of Europe (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bourke, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Reader, 2009</a>). The subsequent Great Famine killed around 1 million people, and an additional million were forced to leave the island (<a href=\"#bib65\">Turner, 2005</a>). Even today, the Irish population remains less than three quarters of what it was at the beginning of the 1840s. These dramatic consequences of the <i>P. infestans</i> epidemic were due to the absence of chemical and genetic methods to combat it; such means became available only several decades later."

Compared to other species in the genus, the 240 Mb T30-4 reference genome of <i>P. infestans</i> is large, with three quarters of the genome consisting of repetitive DNA. A large number of genes codes for effector proteins, many of which are delivered inside plant cells to promote host colonization, for instance by suppressing plant immunity. RXLR proteins, the main class of host-translocated effectors, are encoded by about 550 genes in the <i>P. infestans</i> T30-4 genome. RXLR effectors that can be recognized by plant immune receptors, known as Resistance (R) proteins, are said to have \u2018avirulence\u2019 activity. Upon introduction of a cognate <i>R</i> gene into the host population, such avirulence effectors become a liability for the pathogen, and natural selection favors the spread of pseudogenized or mutated alleles (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vleeshouwers et al., 2011</a>)."

What remains controversial is the relationship of the 19th century strains to modern isolates. The quest for understanding the origin of the strain that resulted in the Irish famine began with extant samples. Prior to the late 1970s, global <i>P. infestans</i> populations outside of South America and Mexico, the centers of diversity of the host and the pathogen, were dominated by a single clonal lineage that had the mitochondrial (mtDNA) haplotype Ib and was called US-1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Goodwin et al., 1994</a>). It was therefore proposed that the US-1 lineage was a direct descendant of the strain that first caused widespread late blight in North America from 1843 on, and then triggered the Irish famine beginning in 1845 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bourke, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Goodwin et al., 1994</a>). This hypothesis was subsequently directly addressed by PCR analysis of infected 19th century potato leaves stored in herbaria. The conclusion from these studies was that the historic strains belonged to a mtDNA haplotype, Ia, that was distinct from that of the US-1 lineage (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ristaino et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">May and Ristaino, 2004</a>). Because Ia was at the time not only the predominant haplotype in the Toluca Valley in Mexico (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gavino and Fry, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Flier et al., 2003</a>), but had also been found in South America (<a href=\"#bib49\">Perez et al., 2001</a>), <a href=\"#bib43\">May and Ristaino (2004)</a> speculated that the 19th century and US-1 lineages represented two independent epidemics of divergent lineages that had both originated in South America and spread from there to North America and Europe. A caveat was that these far-reaching conclusions were based on only three mtDNA SNPs (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ristaino et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">May and Ristaino, 2004</a>)."

To understand the subsequent evolution of the pathogen, we compared the historic <i>P. infestans</i> genomes to those of 15 modern 20th century strains that span the genetic diversity of the species, and to the two sister species <i>P. ipomoeae</i> and <i>P. mirabilis</i>. Our analyses revealed that the 19th century epidemic was caused by a single genotype, HERB-1, that persisted for at least 50 years. While it is distinct from all examined modern strains, HERB-1 is closely related to the 20th century US-1 genotype, suggesting that these two pandemic genotypes may have emerged from a secondary metapopulation rather than from the species\u2019 Mexican center of diversity."

These had been selected based on preliminary mtDNA information to present a cross section of <i>P. infestans</i> diversity. Finally, we sequenced two strains of <i>P. mirabilis</i>, P7722 and PIC99114, and a single strain of <i>P. ipomoeae</i>, PIC99167. Both species are closely related to <i>P. infestans</i> and served as outgroups (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kroon et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Raffaele et al., 2010a</a>). We considered genomes with mean-fold coverage of at least 20 as high coverage; one historic, seven modern and both outgroup genomes fulfilled this condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each sample independently by comparison with the <i>P. infestans</i> reference T30-4 genome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thresholds for calling homozygous and heterozygous SNPs were determined from simulated data from high- and low-coverage genomes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We accepted SNPs from low-coverage genomes if the variants had also been called in a high-coverage genome. Inverse cumulative coverage plots indicated how many high- or low-coverage samples were needed to cover different fractions of SNPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). A total of 4.5 million non-redundant SNPs were called. Eighty percent of all homozygous SNPs were found in at least eight samples, and only 20% of all SNPs were found in fewer than 10 strains. Thus, the great majority of polymorphic sites were shared by several strains and thus informative for phylogenetic analyses."

Surprisingly, a comparison of the complete mtDNA genomes revealed that the historic samples did not fit into any of these groups, and instead formed an independent clade, called HERB-1 from here on. Among the HERB-1 mtDNA genomes, there were very few differences, with a mean pair-wise difference of only 0.2 bp, compared to 3.9 bp for the modern haplotype I strains, and 9.0 bp for modern haplotype II strains. The origin of HERB-1 relative to haplotypes Ia and Ib could not be unequivocally resolved, and a polytomy was inferred for these three groups or support for branches were low (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The molecular clock hypothesis for the modern strains could not be rejected at a 5% significance level (p=0.12).

Collection dates for all herbaria samples and the isolation dates for all modern strains were used as tip calibration points, so that substitution rates per time interval could be calculated (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Three Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs with 147 million iterations were carried out. Stability of the estimated prior and posterior probability distributions (ESS values &gt;5000) and likelihood values (ESS values &gt;9000) were observed in the trace files throughout the merged iterations using the software Tracer (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rambaut and Drummond, 2007</a>).

To test whether the global replacement of HERB-1 by US-1 in the 20th century was due to adaptive mutations, we searched for positively selected genes using PAML (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yang, 2007</a>). We did not find any evidence for genes or sites that had experienced branch-specific positive selection in any of the lineages, only a mosaic pattern with potentially positively selected genes shared across lineages. Alternative scenarios could be that inactivating mutations were more important than non-synonymous substitutions, or that higher overall diversity and re-assortment of beneficial gene variants by recombination contributed to the success of US-1."

To estimate ploidy level in our specimens, we investigated the distribution of read counts at biallelic SNPs for high-coverage genomes. In a diploid species, the mean of read counts at heterozygous positions should have a single mode at 0.5, while there should be two modes, 0.33 and 0.67, for triploid genomes, and three modes, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 for tetraploid genomes. We compared the observed distributions of read counts with computational simulations of diploid, triploid and tetraploid genomes. Based on the shape and kurtosis of the distributions we concluded that the historic M-0182896 genome was apparently diploid. Of the modern genomes, only NL07434 and P17777 were diploid, whereas the majority, including the two US-1 strains DDR7602 and LBUS5 as well as P13527 and P13626 were triploid.

In conclusion, the <i>Avr1</i>, <i>Avr2</i>, <i>Avr3a</i> and <i>Avr4</i> alleles of HERB-1 are intact, presumably functional copies that are identical to ones that can be recognized by the matching <i>R</i> genes <i>R1</i>, <i>R2</i>, <i>R3a</i> and <i>R4</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armstrong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">van Poppel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gilroy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vleeshouwers et al., 2011</a>). This is consistent with the expectation that the HERB-1 genotype must have been avirulent on the first potato cultivars that acquired late blight resistance."

The two major <i>Avr3a</i> alleles encode secreted proteins that differ in two amino acids in their effector domains: AVR3a<sup>KI</sup> and AVR3a<sup>EM</sup> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Only the AVR3a<sup>KI</sup> type triggers signaling by the resistance protein R3a (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armstrong et al., 2005</a>). The <i>R3a</i> gene was introduced into modern potato from <i>S. demissum</i> at the beginning of the 20th century, providing modern potato with resistance against the <i>P. infestans</i> strains prevalent at the time (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hawkes, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gebhardt and Valkonen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Huang et al., 2005</a>). Strains homozygous for <i>Avr3a</i><sup><i>EM</i></sup>, which avoids <i>R3a</i>-mediated detection of the pathogen, appeared later; US-1 isolates lack <i>Avr3a</i><sup><i>EM</i></sup> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armstrong et al., 2005</a>). Examination of <i>Avr3a</i> SNPs in the historic samples only revealed the AVR3a<sup>KI</sup> allele, whereas both alleles were present in modern samples (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). To confirm that the potato hosts of the historic strains lacked the ability to recognize AVR3a<sup>KI</sup>, we assembled de novo short reads from the historic samples and aligned them against the <i>R3a</i> sequence from modern potato (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huang et al., 2005</a>). As expected, we only found <i>R3</i> homologs that were distinct in sequence from <i>R3a</i> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>)."

We could reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship between historic and modern strains using dozens of variants in complete mtDNA genomes, and millions of SNPs in the nuclear genomes, compared to previous work that had to rely on three mtDNA SNPs (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ristaino et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">May and Ristaino, 2004</a>). The topologies of mtDNA and nuclear phylogenies were very similar, with the nuclear genomes yielding additional insights into differences in heterozygosity, ploidy levels and effector gene complement between historic and modern strains. Contrary to previous inferences (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ristaino et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">May and Ristaino, 2004</a>), the 19th century strains are closely related to the modern US-1 lineage, but are characterized by a single, distinct mtDNA haplotype, HERB-1.

That HERB-1 has so far not been found in any modern strain may point to its extinction after the 19th century pandemic, possibly associated with the onset of resistance gene breeding in the 20th century. We cannot, however, exclude that HERB-1 still infects some localized, genetically unimproved host populations, since we have explored only a fraction of current <i>P. infestans</i> genetic diversity.

Our data make it likely that by the late 1970s, direct descendants of HERB-1 had either become rare or extinct. On the other hand, the close relationship between HERB-1 and US-1 suggests that the US-1 lineage originated from a similar source as HERB-1, with our divergence estimates indicating that the two lineages separated only in the early 19th century. Given the much greater genetic diversity at the species\u2019 likely origin in Mexico, it seems unlikely that HERB-1 and US-1 spread independently from this region. An alternative scenario is that a small <i>P. infestans</i> metapopulation was established at the periphery of its center of origin, or even outside Mexico, possibly in North America, some time before the first global <i>P. infestans</i> pandemic. The first lineage to spread from there was HERB-1, which persisted globally for at least half a century. Subsequently, the US-1 lineage expanded and spread, replacing HERB-1 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>)."

In agreement with the products of these <i>R</i> genes being able to recognize HERB-1 effectors, HERB-1 strains seem to have only the <i>Avr3a</i><sup><i>KI</i></sup> allele, which interacts with the product of the <i>R</i> gene <i>R3a</i> to trigger a host immune response (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armstrong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Huang et al., 2005</a>). Moreover, de novo assembly of potato DNA did not provide evidence for the presence of <i>R3a</i> in the herbarium hosts, consistent with the narrative of potato breeding (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hawkes, 1990</a>).

Polyploidization could have provided an opportunity for US-1 isolates to enhance allelic diversity in the absence of frequent sexual reproduction, and could thus have contributed to their global success. Asexual reproduction leads to an increase of deleterious mutation in the population due to a lack of meiotic recombination (<a href=\"#bib17\">Felsenstein, 1974</a>). Therefore, if the major selection pressure that led to the replacement of HERB-1 by US-1 was the introduction of resistance gene breeding, greater variation at effector genes in polyploid US-1 strains could have contributed to the replacement of HERB-1 soon after <i>R</i> genes from <i>S. demissum</i> and other wild species had been introduced into modern potato germplasm."

Most contigs matched proteins from either potato, <i>Solanum tuberosum</i>, or to microbial species <i>P. infestans</i>, <i>Pantoea vagans</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. To focus on <i>P. infestans</i>, we aligned fragments that were at least 140 bp to the genomes of <i>P. infestans</i>, <i>S. tuberosum</i>, <i>P. vagans</i>, <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>syringae</i>, and <i>P. fluorescens</i> with blastn.

In BWA, if reads match several genomic regions, one genomic location is randomly chosen as default (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>). Thus, it is possible that BWA alignment distributes reads coming from the same gene across several, closely related genes in the target genome.

The samples were subsequently grouped into ancient and modern strains. The ancient and modern nucleotide distances were significantly different (Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, p=0.0003). We furthermore correlated the nucleotide distance of HERB-1, haplotype Ia and haplotype Ib mtDNA genomes to the outgroup P17777 with the tip age of each sample."

A multiple sequence alignment that included all 12 nearly complete modern <i>P. infestans</i> mtDNA sequences plus all 13 herbaria samples was used as input. In order to test if the mtDNAs evolved clock like a likelihood ratio test was performed in MEGA5 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tamura et al., 2011</a>) by comparing the maximum likelihood (ML) value for the given topology using only the modern strains with and without the molecular clock constraints. The null hypothesis of equal evolutionary rate throughout the tree was not rejected at a 5% significance level (p=0.115). All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated resulting in a total of 22,591 positions in the final dataset."

For the tree prior, five different models were tested including four coalescence models: constant size, expansion growth, exponential growth, logistic growth and a epidemiology birth\u2013death model (<a href=\"#bib59\">Stadler, 2010</a>). For each tree prior, three MCMC runs were carried out with 10,000,000 iterations each and subsequently merged using LogCombiner 1.7.5 from the BEAST package. Resulting ESS values and overall posterior likelihoods were compared using the software Tracer (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rambaut and Drummond, 2007</a>). The birth-death model gave the highest ESS values and posterior likelihood and was therefore chosen for the subsequent dating analysis. The collection dates for all herbaria samples as well as the isolation dates for all modern strains were used as tip calibration points (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Three MCMC runs were carried out with 50,000,000 iterations each, sampling every 10,000 steps. The first 1,000,000 iterations were discarded as burn-in resulting in a total of 147,000,000 iterations."

It draws on both the availability of historic samples of <i>P. infestans</i> and the power of next-generation sequencing to re-evaluate the 19th century pandemic that precipitated the Irish Famine. Overall, the conclusion of a single clonal lineage, HERB-1, dominating the late blight population outside of Mexico for at least 50 years, closely related to US-1, but perhaps giving way to variants derived from the latter, is well supported by the data. The derivation of both HERB-1 and US-1 from a common ancestor within a \u201cmetapopulation\u201d outside of Mexico, the accepted centre of <i>P. infestans</i> diversity, again seems likely. Of interest is the apparent increase in ploidy levels in 20th century isolates, compared to HERB-1 and US-1, although it should be stressed that this is based entirely on projected allele frequencies (rather than backed up by other means)."

What exactly is meant by a \u201cfull effector gene complement\u201d? I guess they intend the focus to be on avirulences recognised by the <i>S. demissum R</i> genes? These would be AVR1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4 of those shown in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; the others are not pertinent to their line of logic. In <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, the coverage of AVR2 is 100% for the isolate 06_3928A, a \u201cBlue_13\u201d genotype representative. Actually, this genotype lacks AVR2, expressing instead AVR2-like, which suggests that the % coverage they show in this table is lacking the detail to reach their conclusion: \u201cconsistent with the expectation that the HERB-1 genotype was avirulent on the first potato cultivars that acquired late blight resistance through breeding\u201d. The focus is on AVR3a, and it is interesting that the KI allele alone exists in the HERB-1 lineage. Did they specifically amplify and sequence this gene from all of the herbarium samples? If their conclusions are based entirely on sequence assemblies (from NGS of ancient DNA), then they need to be backed up by additional experiments. AVR4 has been well documented to be \u201clost\u201d through mutation that leads to truncated proteins. Is AVR4 intact in the historical samples? I am surprised by the apparent absence of <i>Avr3b</i>. This is a gene that is conserved in <i>P. parasitica</i>, for example. Indeed, they show good coverage in mirabilis and ipomeae in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. Did they specifically check this absence by alternative means (i.e., PCR and sequencing)?"

The corresponding <i>R</i> genes have not been bred into the cultivated potato, so they represent a contrast in terms of the selection pressures that they refer to in 20th century breeding efforts (i.e., introduction of the demissum <i>R</i> genes)."

Unfortunately, in general, ancient DNA is heavily fragmentized. In fact, the average length of our 19th century <i>P. infestans</i> libraries is rather short (\u223c70 bp). Hundreds of PCR amplifications would be necessary to reconstruct the effector genes consuming far more DNA extract than what was used for all complete genome reconstructions. Such a project would be extremely challenging and would likely result much more molecular biology effort than the genome wide reconstruction. In fact, PCR approaches have been largely abandoned in the ancient DNA field due to the waste of precious material, a high contamination risk, and their low efficiency (Knapp &amp; Hofreiter, Genes 1, 227-43 [2010]; Stoneking &amp; Krause, <i>Nat. Rev. Genet</i> 12, 603-14 [2011]). The whole\u2010genome sequencing using next-generation sequencing methods approach is therefore currently seen as the most reliable and efficient way to reconstruct ancient genomic regions."
