This may have fatal consequences in newborn babies and result in sudden infant death. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we present a novel breathing brainstem organotypic culture that generates rhythmic neural network and motor activity for 3 weeks. We show that increased CO<sub>2</sub> elicits a gap junction-dependent release of PGE<sub>2</sub>. This alters neural network activity in the preB\u00f6tzinger rhythm-generating complex and in the chemosensitive brainstem respiratory regions, thereby increasing sigh frequency and the depth of inspiration. We used mice lacking eicosanoid prostanoid 3 receptors (EP3R), breathing brainstem organotypic slices and optogenetic inhibition of EP3R<sup>+/+</sup> cells to demonstrate that the EP3R is important for the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Our study identifies a novel pathway linking the inflammatory and respiratory systems, with implications for inspiration and sighs throughout life, and the ability to autoresuscitate when breathing fails."

This may have fatal consequences in newborn babies and result in sudden infant death. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we present a novel breathing brainstem organotypic culture that generates rhythmic neural network and motor activity for 3 weeks. We show that increased CO<sub>2</sub> elicits a gap junction-dependent release of PGE<sub>2</sub>. This alters neural network activity in the preB\u00f6tzinger rhythm-generating complex and in the chemosensitive brainstem respiratory regions, thereby increasing sigh frequency and the depth of inspiration. We used mice lacking eicosanoid prostanoid 3 receptors (EP3R), breathing brainstem organotypic slices and optogenetic inhibition of EP3R<sup>+/+</sup> cells to demonstrate that the EP3R is important for the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Our study identifies a novel pathway linking the inflammatory and respiratory systems, with implications for inspiration and sighs throughout life, and the ability to autoresuscitate when breathing fails."

We know that in a part of the brain called the brainstem, several regions work together to create breaths, but it is not clear precisely how this works. These regions adjust our breathing to the demands placed on the body by different activities, such as sleeping or exercising. Sometimes, especially in newborn babies, the brainstem\u2019s monitoring of oxygen and carbon dioxide does not work properly, which can lead to abnormal breathing and possibly death."

Here, Forsberg et al. investigated the neural networks in the brainstem that generate and control breathing in mice. They used slices of mouse brainstem that had been kept alive in a dish in the laboratory. The slice contained an arrangement of neurons and supporting cells that allowed it to continue to produce patterns of electrical activity that are associated with breathing. Over a three-week period, Forsberg et al. monitored the activity of the cells and calculated how they were connected to each other. The experiments show that the neurons responsible for breathing were organized in a \u201csmall-world\u201d network, in which the neurons are connected to each other directly or via small numbers of other neurons."

For example, carbon dioxide triggered the release of a small molecule called prostaglandin E2 from cells. This molecule is known to play a role in inflammation and fever. However, in the carbon dioxide sensing region of the brainstem it acted as a signaling molecule that increased activity. Therefore, inflammation could interfere with the body\u2019s normal response to carbon dioxide and lead to potentially life-threatening breathing problems. Furthermore, prostaglandin E2 induced deeper breaths known as sighs, which may be vital for newborn babies to be able to take their first deep breaths of life. Future challenges include understanding how the brainstem neural networks generate breathing and translate this knowledge to improve the treatment of breathing difficulties in babies."

Our novel data reveal an important role of the EP3R in the pFRG/RTN hypercapnic response and furthermore suggest that PGE<sub>2</sub> is released during hypercapnia, possibly through CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive connexin hemichannels. Inflammation, with its associated PGE<sub>2</sub> release, exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> and a lack of EP3R, blunts the hypercapnic response.

The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from synapse-independent cells remained, however with a lower frequency and higher coefficient of variation (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Regions outside the brainstem nuclei contained active cells, without intercellular coordination (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g</a>). This cellular activity ceased during TTX treatment. In conclusion, the brainstem slice cultures contain a preserved preB\u00f6tC network with a small-world structure."

However, as hypercapnia seems to induce a release of PGE<sub>2</sub> while stimulating breathing activity, we hypothesized that PGE<sub>2</sub> has a direct stimulatory effect on the pFRG/RTN. Indeed, PGE<sub>2</sub> increased the signaling frequency of pFRG/RTN neurons (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12a\u2013b</a>, <a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>). This effect was EP3R dependent, and EP3Rs were present in the pFRG/RTN, expressed both on respiratory neurons and on astrocytes (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12c\u2013e</a>). We also observed a non-significant increase in amplitude (8 \u00b1 3% and 11 \u00b1 4% increase compared to control period, N.S.). Neither the PGE<sub>2</sub> effect nor the hypercapnic response of the pFRG/RTN was affected by Riluzole (30 \u00b1 5 mHz vs 25 \u00b1 2 mHz, N.S., N=6, and 36 \u00b1 2 mHz vs 35 \u00b1 6 mHz, N.S., N=6). qRT-PCR showed abundant expression of the EP3R\u03b3 subtype, which couples to the G<sub>S</sub>-protein (<a href=\"#bib55\">Namba et al., 1993</a>). This would lead to an increase in intracellular cAMP in the pFRG/RTN <i>Ptger3</i>-expressing cells in response to PGE<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12f</a>)."

The majority of previous studies were performed on brainstem-spinal cord preparations (<i>en bloc</i>) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Onimaru, 1995</a>) or acute slices (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ruangkittisakul et al., 2006</a>). However, these preparations remain active only for hours, making it difficult to study development and long-term effects on respiratory rhythm. Organotypic slice cultures provide a bridge between cell cultures and animals in vivo (<a href=\"#bib94\">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</a>). Their preserved three dimensional structure allows functional circuits to be studied and manipulated over time under microenvironmental control (<a href=\"#bib15\">G\u00e4hwiler et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gogolla et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Preynat-Seauve et al., 2009</a>). First used with hippocampal tissue (<a href=\"#bib14\">G\u00e4hwiler, 1988</a>), the organotypic culturing method has since expanded to research on the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lu et al., 2011</a>) as well as on the brainstem auditory circuits (<a href=\"#bib84\">Thonabulsombat et al., 2007</a>). Recently, Phillips and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib63\">Phillips et al., 2016</a>) presented an organotypic model system of the preB\u00f6tzinger complex with respiration-related neuronal rhythm that persists for a month. Here, we characterize this new type of brainstem slice culture further, and also provide details on respiratory network structure and functional respiratory-related motor output. In addition we show that also the pFRG/RTN retains respiration-related rhythmic activity and chemosensitivity. As with all model systems, it has its limitations, e.g., the slices lose several respiratory-related regions (<a href=\"#bib78\">Smith et al., 2009</a>). Nonetheless, in contrast to acute slices and the brainstem-spinal cord preparation, our new experimental model system allows long-term studies and manipulation of respiratory networks. This enables the use of different techniques and methods, and significantly reduces the number of procedures that otherwise need to be performed on live animals, as well as the total number of experimental animals. We have exploited this advantage by transfecting the brainstem slice cultures in vitro to be suitable for optogenetic techniques."

This finding is in line with a previous topological analysis based on neuronal staining in the preB\u00f6tC (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hartelt et al., 2008</a>). The present insights into the network structure of the pFRG/RTN have not been achieved previously with other methods.

During development, gap junction-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients\u00a0stimulate the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Malmersjo et al., 2013</a>) and form a template for chemical synapses to coordinate more mature neural networks (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jaderstad et al., 2010</a>).

Notably, even though fewer cells remained active, respiratory neuron frequency and network structure were not affected. Although both CBX and 18-\u03b1-GA are commonly used as gap junction inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib80\">Solomon et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Elsen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">V\u00e9liz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jaderstad et al., 2010</a>), these drugs have side effects (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rekling et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schnell et al., 2012</a>). We used GZA as a control substance because it is structurally similar to CBX but does not have any gap junction inhibiting properties (<a href=\"#bib80\">Solomon et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li and Duffin, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Elsen et al., 2008</a>). However, it mimics many of the side effects of CBX, e.g. the initial stimulatory effect seen in the present study. These limitations need to be kept in mind when interpreting our results on gap junction functions, and further studies are needed to confirm them, preferably using more specific methods of connexin blockage, such as RNAi."

Thus, neonatal preB\u00f6tC synchronization is both gap junction-and synaptic signal-dependent (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feldman and Kam, 2015</a>), and it probably contains both neuronal and glial subnetworks. The pFRG/RTN, by contrast, requires gap junctions for its establishment in rodents but is not dependent on them postnatally for rhythmic, correlated network activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fortin and Thoby-Brisson, 2009</a>). The main mechanism that drives activity in the pFRG/RTN is glutamatergic (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guyenet et al., 2013</a>). By contrast, pFRG/RTN gap junctions seem here to be involved in the hypercapnic response (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> and <a href=\"#fig11\">11</a>).

The results in this study suggest that Cx26 also releases PGE<sub>2</sub>, possiblyfrom mPGEs-1<sup>+</sup> astrocytes. PGE<sub>2</sub> increases respiratory activity via the stimulatory G-protein coupled receptor EP3R\u03b3 on pFRG/RTN neurons. Thus, inflammation, hypoxia, and hypercapnia alter respiratory neural network and motor output and breathing activity through distinct effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> in the pFRG/RTN and the preB\u00f6tC, respectively. Chronically elevated PGE<sub>2</sub> levels, as observed during ongoing inflammation, may decrease the central pattern generators\u2019 ability to respond to hypoxic and hypercapnic events.

In many disease states, acute inflammatory responses are initially protective but become harmful under chronic conditions. In our previous reports, we demonstrated how the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 impairs respiration during infection by inducing a PGE<sub>2</sub> release in the vicinity of respiratory centers. We also showed that infection is the main cause of respiratory disorders in preterm infants (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hofstetter et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2008</a>) and, in the case of apneas, bradycardias and desaturations (ABD) events in neonates (<a href=\"#bib76\">Siljehav et al., 2015</a>). PGE<sub>2</sub> is also a key component in the regulation of sigh frequency (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ramirez, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Koch et al., 2015</a>). During and immediately after birth, PGE<sub>2</sub> levels are increased (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mitchell et al., 1978</a>). Indeed, the first breaths of extrauterine life are deep and sigh-like, facilitating alveolar recruitment and CO<sub>2</sub> removal (<a href=\"#bib52\">Mian et al., 2015</a>). In the brainstem slice cultures, PGE<sub>2</sub> had a direct EP3R-dependent effect on both respiratory centers. Notably, PGE<sub>2</sub> increased pFRG/RTN but inhibited preB\u00f6tC frequency (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). This finding might be explained by the different distributions of EP3R subtypes in the different regions (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). The coupling to inhibitory or stimulatory G proteins depends on the alternative post-transcriptional splicing of the C-terminal tail of the EP3R preprotein (<a href=\"#bib55\">Namba et al., 1993</a>). Furthermore, PGE<sub>2</sub> caused a longer Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient and a higher relative amplitude in an I<sub>NaP</sub>-dependent manner, mimicking the PGE<sub>2</sub>-based induction of sighs that we observe in vivo and that were recently reported by Koch and colleagues in acute preB\u00f6tC slices (<a href=\"#bib38\">Koch et al., 2015</a>)."

The astrocytic involvement in the CO<sub>2</sub> response is also evident in a Rett syndrome model (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) knockout), in which conditional MeCP2 knockout in astroglia blunts the CO<sub>2</sub> response (<a href=\"#bib86\">Turovsky et al., 2015</a>).

Regions of interest were marked for all cells based on the standard deviation of fluorescence intensity over time, by using a semiautomatic-adapted ImageJ script kindly provided by Dr. John Hayes (The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA,\u00a0<a href=\"http://physimage.sourceforge.net/\">http://physimage.sourceforge.net/</a>). The mean intensity value and coordinates were measured using ImageJ. Average intensities of regions of interest were quantified for each frame, and dynamic fluorescence signals were normalized to baseline values. The linear similarity (Pearson correlation) was calculated (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) between pairs of Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces with a custom-made script in MATLAB (version 7.9.0.529 R2009b; MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and by using the mic2net toolbox (<a href=\"#bib77\">Smedler et al., 2014</a>) (version 6.12; MathWorks). Calculating the pairwise correlation coefficients resulted in a correlation matrix that was converted to an adjacency matrix by applying a cut-off level. The cut-off level was selected by calculating the mean of the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of correlation coefficients for a set of experiments with scrambled signals. Scrambling was performed by randomly translating all traces in the time-domain. The network structure was visualized by plotting a line between pairs of cells, where the color of the lines was proportionate to the correlation coefficient. This was plotted on top of an image of the standard deviations of the fluorescence over time per pixel. Connectivity was defined as the number of cell pairs with a correlation coefficient larger than the cut-off value divided by the total number of the pairs of cells. This provided a measure of the degree of connections within a network. Small-world parameter, mean shortest path length (\u03bb) and mean clustering coefficient (\u03c3) were calculated by using the MATLAB BGL library (<a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10922\">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10922</a>) and compared to corresponding randomized networks. Many biological networks have a small-world structure, where the mean shortest path length is as short as in random networks and the mean clustering coefficient is higher. This signifies that the average number of nodes (for example, neural cells) that a signal has to pass is low, and that many of the nodes are connected in clusters (<a href=\"#bib91\">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</a>). A small-world network structure creates the possibilities of regional specialization and efficient signal transfer, and is a common organization of networks within the brain (<a href=\"#bib82\">Telesford et al., 2011</a>)."

PGE2 released in response to CO<sub>2</sub> acts on prostaglandin EP3 receptors located in two main structures involved in respiratory rhythm generation, modulation and CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity: the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC) and the parafacial respiratory group/retrotrapezoid nucleus (pFRG/RTN). The authors propose that this PGE2-EP3R pathway is an essential component of the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> and a vital modulator of respiratory activity, including sighing. The present results build upon previous results by Herlenius et al., showing that IL-1\u03b2 impairs breathing during infection by inducing PGE2 release in the vicinity of brainstem respiratory networks (Hoffsteter et al. 2007), that inflammation via PGE2 and EP3R alters the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> in brainstem spinal cord preparations (Siljehav et al., 2014), and other recent works on the role of PGE2 in the regulation of breathing pattern, in particular sigh frequency (Koch et al., 2015)."

In particular, they extended these experiments through electrophysiological studies in slice cultures of the brainstem with a functioning pFRG/RTN and preB\u00f6tC. Furthermore, connectivity analysis of preB\u00f6tC and pFRG/RTN respiratory networks (a very original aspect of the paper) showed that the hypercapnic response is dependent on gap junctions. The authors also used Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and optogenetic silencing of EP3R-expressing cells to assess the role of this pathway in the hypercapnic response of the pFRG/RTN."

The study focuses more on the role of gap junctions than glia cells, and there is no experiment that actually tests the direct involvement of glia, or \"astrocytic release\" as stated in the Abstract. The role of glia is primarily inferred by prior work, e.g. by Gourine. The reviewers have no principle concern with the conclusion, and this possibility should be discussed, but the title, Introduction and Abstract should not imply that this study is about the role of glia. Along the same lines, the authors should avoid strong statements such as \"PGE2 is released from astrocytes through CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive connexin hemichannels\". This is good for a discussion, but included into the Introduction (last paragraph) suggests that this will actually be demonstrated in the paper. Even with regards to the gap junctions. the authors did not really test gap junctions. The toxins used are not entirely specific. This should be discussed."

However, this was not directly shown in the experiments conducted. The authors demonstrate changes after blocking gap junctions and blocking P2Rs alters the response, but this does not mean that astrocytes are releasing either PGE2 or ATP.

However, the authors leave out a number of critical aspects with regards to the preparation that make the results difficult to evaluate. Firstly, it is unclear why such a preparation is necessary or what advantages it has compared to the classic rhythmic slice preparation. Acute measurements in the rhythmic slice preparation or a pFRG/RTN slice preparation would be just as advantageous for such experiments. Further, the authors are not clear about how long the slice culture is \"breathing\". No traces are shown to demonstrate baseline activity after 1, 2, or 3 weeks for the reader to see how activity changes with longer time in culture, and thus how the presented results might change with time. The authors do present data that the connectivity and number of active cells does not change with time (though the connectivity diagrams do appear to change over time especially when evaluating the raw numbers), but it is not clear how this would be observed in \"breathing\" or rhythmic/oscillatory behaviour. For example, is there any rhythmic activity after 3 weeks in culture in either the pFRG/RTN slices or the preB\u00f6tC slices?"

And since information is lacking in most figures and data presentation regarding the details of the slice preparation from which the data was obtained (i.e. 1, 2, or 3 weeks in culture), the reviewer assumes that the data from all weeks were collapsed, but without additional information, it is not clear whether such collapsing of data is appropriate. The authors also switch back and forth between saying \"organotypic slice cultures\", cultured cells, or slices. It would aid the reader if the authors used one terminology.

The authors talk about \"clustered activity\", \"clusters of high correlated activity\". What do they mean with this? Only in the last few sentences of the subsection \u201cPhysiological measurements of brainstem respiratory activity demonstrate functional and responsive networks\u201d they state that the preB\u00f6tC remains rhythmic. The authors show something on <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, but it doesn't look like rhythmicity. Yet, in the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, the authors imply that they have population rhythmicity that seems to even drive XII activity. Please try to be more concrete. Did these slices generate rhythmicity? What kind of properties do they find: frequency, amplitude, and also regularity? Do the calcium oscillations correspond to the \"clustered\" neuronal activities in frequency?"

However, it is not entirely clear how these two functions work together, and whether the same neurons are responsible for active expiration and CO<sub>2</sub> sensing. Phox2B is a good marker for the sensing aspect, but the rhythmicity observed in the pFRG/RTN slice may relate to \"active expiration\", and not necessarily to CO<sub>2</sub> sensing. Clearly, the slice will also contain CO<sub>2</sub> sensing neurons. Both possibilities are interesting, and both could play a role. The excitatory effect on the pFRG/RTN could imply that PGE2 induces active expiration, a possibility that has not been discussed in this paper. Discussing the role of active expiration should be considered, and the authors should also discuss the general issue of \"rhythm generating function\" versus \"CO<sub>2</sub> sensing\", and the fact that this may not be related to the same neurons, but that PGE2 may affect both."

Specifically, the experimental support for this claim is not convincing (mainly in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig11\">11</a>). There are several problems in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> that may question whether the inhibition of gap junctions by 18-a-GA abolished the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>. On the one hand, Panel b (top trace) and c (left graph) seem to indicate that 18-\u03b1-GA abolishes the response to CO<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, in Panel c, the CO<sub>2</sub> responses are the same whether gap junctions are inhibited by 18-\u03b1-GA or not (GZA, i.e. the negative control for the gap junction inhibitors 18\u03b1-GA). In fact, control values (in air) in the middle and right graphs are very similar, and the values obtained for GZA+ CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>+18-\u03b1-GA are also very similar. This apparent contradiction is reflected in the legend: it is first stated that \"hypercarbic responses were abolished when gap junctions were inhibited by 18-\u03b1-GA\", but later on, the legend states that \"the hypercarbic response was attenuated but not completely reversed by 18-\u03b1-GA\". Some details in this figure also need attention. DF/F0 in Panel b should not be expressed in \"arbitrary units\", as mentioned. It is in fact a dimensionless variable (there is nothing to add after \"DF/F0\" on the y-axis label). Also, the scales are different for the different traces in Panel b, which is misleading. The experimental basis of the abolition of the CO<sub>2</sub> response in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a> also presents some shortcomings. Panel a indicates a lack of response to CO<sub>2</sub> after AH6809 treatment, but there is no experimental control showing the time course of frequency changes in the absence of AH6808. In Panel f, the top graph lacks a control (e. g. a return to normocapnia). As presented, it is unclear whether the response to CO<sub>2</sub> was abolished, as implied by the authors, or whether the period of measurement was too short for the full CO<sub>2</sub> response to appear. In the bottom graph, the light stimulus seems to stabilize the hypercapnic response, not to abolish it, which departs from the clear-cut return to baseline presented in Panel g, left graph. This raises a concern on the way data were averaged in Panel g."

Since the majority of studies investigating hypercapnic responses has used acidification/pH changes as a stimulus (including the papers referenced in this manuscript), the authors should address this discrepancy. The authors need to address the rationale for choosing to investigate proton-independent changes in CO<sub>2</sub> instead of changes in pH/H<sup>+</sup>, as is commonly done in the field. While CO<sub>2</sub> may be a direct activator of cells, most literature to date has tested changes in pH. Additionally, many of the papers referenced in the manuscript in support of using proton-independent increased CO<sub>2</sub>, actually used pH to evoke changes. For example, Gourine et al. used changes in pH to examine involvement of ATP-P2Rs, yet the authors use these previous studies as rationale to look at the effects of proton-independent increased CO<sub>2</sub> on the pFRG/RTN (Results, subsection \u201cThe pFRG/RTN respiratory region exhibited correlated network activity and retained CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity\u201d). This discrepancy and rationale for using such a stimulus is not addressed in the present manuscript. Do the authors think that the same results would be obtained if experiments were conducted by altering pH? Why are the results proton-independent responses important?

Control littermates are highly preferable, to control for date of birth, maternal care, litter size etc. These factors, also influence the maturation of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity.

This point is ambiguous in the manuscript. In Methods, sighs are defined as \"a breath with &gt;50% increase in inspired volume compared to eupneic breaths\", but there is no indication of how these reference eupneic breaths were determined. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c and 1d</a>, not all sighs (arrows) seem to fulfill these criteria. In the legend for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, sighs are defined differently, as \"an inspiratory volume and respiratory cycle period increase followed by a 2-cycle pause\". In fact, apnea does not occur systematically after a sigh and cannot be a defining characteristic. Besides, the trace in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> that illustrates the authors' definition does not display any post-sigh pause. In contrast, a defining characteristic of sighs is their biphasic pattern (see Toporikova et al., 2015 and the references quoted in her article). Without taking into account this biphasic pattern, above-average breaths may be confused with sighs, especially in a context of increased variability. There are also several minor concerns with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>: sigh frequencies (Panel c) do not exemplify the mean values shown in Panel d; in Panels c, e and f, only relevant comparisons are necessary. In Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1, it is puzzling that there are 11 divisions between 100 and 200 on the y-axis. Also, with a 60% increase in Fr (compared to WT) and a 30% increase in VT (compared to WT), the EP3R<sup>-/-</sup> mice only displayed a 20-30% increase in VE (compared to WT). Is this correct?"

Since those experiments did not answer our main questions fully, we have now created a novel brainstem slice culture for the pFRG/RTN and characterized it as well.

Specifically, the experimental support for this claim is not convincing (mainly in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig11\">11</a>). There are several problems in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> that may question whether the inhibition of gap junctions by 18-a-GA abolished the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>. On the one hand, Panel b (top trace) and c (left graph) seem to indicate that 18-\u03b1-GA abolishes the response to CO<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, in Panel c, the CO<sub>2</sub> responses are the same whether gap junctions are inhibited by 18-\u03b1-GA or not (GZA, i.e. the negative control for the gap junction inhibitors 18\u03b1-GA). In fact, control values (in air) in the middle and right graphs are very similar, and the values obtained for GZA+ CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>+18-\u03b1-GA are also very similar. This apparent contradiction is reflected in the legend: it is first stated that \"hypercarbic responses were abolished when gap junctions were inhibited by 18-\u03b1-GA\", but later on, the legend states that \"the hypercarbic response was attenuated but not completely reversed by 18-\u03b1-GA\". Some details in this figure also need attention. DF/F0 in Panel b should not be expressed in \"arbitrary units\", as mentioned. It is in fact a dimensionless variable (there is nothing to add after \"DF/F0\" on the y-axis label). Also, the scales are different for the different traces in Panel b, which is misleading. The experimental basis of the abolition of the CO<sub>2</sub> response in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a> also presents some shortcomings. Panel a indicates a lack of response to CO<sub>2</sub> after AH6809 treatment, but there is no experimental control showing the time course of frequency changes in the absence of AH6808. In Panel f, the top graph lacks a control (e. g. a return to normocapnia). As presented, it is unclear whether the response to CO<sub>2</sub> was abolished, as implied by the authors, or whether the period of measurement was too short for the full CO<sub>2</sub> response to appear. In the bottom graph, the light stimulus seems to stabilize the hypercapnic response, not to abolish it, which departs from the clear-cut return to baseline presented in Panel g, left graph.

Since the majority of studies investigating hypercapnic responses has used acidification/pH changes as a stimulus (including the papers referenced in this manuscript), the authors should address this discrepancy. The authors need to address the rationale for choosing to investigate proton-independent changes in CO<sub>2</sub> instead of changes in pH/H<sup>+</sup>, as is commonly done in the field. While CO<sub>2</sub> may be a direct activator of cells, most literature to date has tested changes in pH. Additionally, many of the papers referenced in the manuscript in support of using proton-independent increased CO<sub>2</sub>, actually used pH to evoke changes. For example, Gourine et al. used changes in pH to examine involvement of ATP-P2Rs, yet the authors use these previous studies as rationale to look at the effects of proton-independent increased CO<sub>2</sub> on the pFRG/RTN (Results, subsection \u201cThe pFRG/RTN respiratory region exhibited correlated network activity and retained CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity\u201d). This discrepancy and rationale for using such a stimulus is not addressed in the present manuscript. Do the authors think that the same results would be obtained if experiments were conducted by altering pH? Why are the results proton-independent responses important? These questions are not addressed in the manuscript and would greatly improve the clarity and impact of the results.</i>"

If not, were the controls simply obtained from a C57Bl/6J strain? Control littermates are highly preferable, to control for date of birth, maternal care, litter size etc. These factors, also influence the maturation of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity.

This point is ambiguous in the manuscript. In Methods, sighs are defined as \"a breath with &gt;50% increase in inspired volume compared to eupneic breaths\", but there is no indication of how these reference eupneic breaths were determined. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c and 1d</a>, not all sighs (arrows) seem to fulfill these criteria. In the legend for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, sighs are defined differently, as \"an inspiratory volume and respiratory cycle period increase followed by a 2-cycle pause\". In fact, apnea does not occur systematically after a sigh and cannot be a defining characteristic. Besides, the trace in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> that illustrates the authors' definition does not display any post-sigh pause. In contrast, a defining characteristic of sighs is their biphasic pattern (see Toporikova et al., 2015 and the references quoted in her article). Without taking into account this biphasic pattern, above-average breaths may be confused with sighs, especially in a context of increased variability. There are also several minor concerns with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>: sigh frequencies (Panel c) do not exemplify the mean values shown in Panel d; in Panels c, e and f, only relevant comparisons are necessary. In Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1, it is puzzling that there are 11 divisions between 100 and 200 on the y-axis. Also, with a 60% increase in Fr (compared to WT) and a 30% increase in VT (compared to WT), the EP3R<sup>-/-</sup> mice only displayed a 20-30% increase in VE (compared to WT). Is this correct?</i>"
