                    "text": "The brain has evolved an internal model of gravity to cope with life in the Earth's gravitational environment. How this internal model benefits the implementation of skilled movement has remained unsolved. One prevailing theory has assumed that this internal model is used to compensate for gravity's mechanical effects on the body, such as to maintain invariant motor trajectories. Alternatively, gravity force could be used purposely and efficiently for the planning and execution of voluntary movements, thereby resulting in direction-depending kinematics. Here we experimentally interrogate these two hypotheses by measuring arm kinematics while varying movement direction in normal and zero-G gravity conditions. By comparing experimental results with model predictions, we show that the brain uses the internal model to implement control policies that take advantage of gravity to minimize movement effort."

How this internal model benefits the implementation of skilled movement has remained unsolved. One prevailing theory has assumed that this internal model is used to compensate for gravity's mechanical effects on the body, such as to maintain invariant motor trajectories. Alternatively, gravity force could be used purposely and efficiently for the planning and execution of voluntary movements, thereby resulting in direction-depending kinematics. Here we experimentally interrogate these two hypotheses by measuring arm kinematics while varying movement direction in normal and zero-G gravity conditions. By comparing experimental results with model predictions, we show that the brain uses the internal model to implement control policies that take advantage of gravity to minimize movement effort."

It has been proposed that adaptation to the Earth\u2019s gravity field has allowed control policies to evolve that take advantage of environmental dynamics \u2013 use gravity as an assistive force to accelerate downward movements and as a resistive force to decelerate upward movements. This strategy, which has been formalized into a <i>Minimum Smooth-Effort</i> model, would result in movement kinematics that varies with direction (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berret et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gaveau et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, upward movements were shown to have shorter time to peak velocity and larger curvature than downward movements, but such comparisons were until now largely qualitative (<a href=\"#bib54\">Papaxanthis et al., 1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gentili et al., 2007</a>). Furthermore, upward/downward direction-dependent kinematics could also arise from the complex dynamics of the peripheral neuromuscular system. For example, the firing properties of extensor motoneurons (pulling the arm downwards when upright) are known to obey different rules from those of flexor motoneurons (pulling upwards when uptight; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cotel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wilson et al., 2015</a>). In addition, muscle force production generated by eccentric contraction (elongation, e.g. downward movements for flexors) is also known to obey differing rules from concentric contraction (e.g. upward movement for flexors; for a review see <a href=\"#bib22\">Enoka, 1996</a>). Because of these asymmetrical neuromuscular peripheral properties, upward/downward kinematic asymmetries cannot necessarily be attributed to gravity effort optimality (i.e., minimization of muscular force to elevate and lower the arm). Thus, a solid test of the effort optimization hypothesis has been lacking."

First, we contrast predictions of optimal control models that either compensate or take advantage of gravity force effects. Then, we quantitatively compare these predictions with actual kinematic features of arm movements in multiple directions. Second, in order to discard a possible influence of peripheral neuromuscular mechanisms, we measure how differences in upward versus downward arm movement kinematics are influenced by the lack of gravity during the zero-G phase of parabolic flight. If directional asymmetries originate from asymmetric firing of flexor/extensor motoneurons, they should persist in the absence of gravity because motoneurons properties are not expected to change during the short zero-G phase of a parabolic flight (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ishihara et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2002</a>; for a review see <a href=\"#bib48\">Nagatomo et al., 2014</a>). On the other hand, if they originate from eccentric versus concentric force production differences, directional asymmetries should cease to exist instantly in 0g because movement dynamics no longer differ for upward and downward movements (<a href=\"#bib22\">Enoka, 1996</a>). Alternatively, however, if directional asymmetries originate from neural planning processes that take advantage of the internal model of gravity, following a gradual recalibration of the gravity internal model, directional asymmetries should progressively decrease towards new optimal zero-G values (<a href=\"#bib45\">McIntyre et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Izawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Snaterse et al., 2011</a>).

In single-degree of freedom movements, although the spatial shape of the endpoint trajectory is circular and constant across directions, the temporal shape of the endpoint trajectory (the form of the velocity profile) could change. As a measure of the shape of the velocity profile, we define a symmetry ratio (SR: acceleration time divided by the total movement time). SR corresponds to the relative timing of peak velocity (as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and thus allows quantifying whether arm kinematics remains invariant (<i>compensation</i> hypothesis prediction) or changes (<i>effort optimization</i> hypothesis prediction) with movement direction. Here we use the optimal control framework (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bryson\u00a0and\u00a0Ho, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Todorov, 2004</a>) to simulate arm movement planning in different directions.

(<b>B</b>) The Work of Gravity Torque (WGT), projected onto the plane of motion and integrated over the whole movement, is plotted as a function of movement direction (same color code as in <b>A</b>). This non-linear (cosine-tuned) dependence is well fitted by a sigmoidal function (black curve, average RMSE = 0.12; [min: 0.09, max: 0.15], see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Positive/negative values indicate that WGT has the same/opposite direction as the arm movement.

Each data point represents the prediction for one subject moving in one direction (n\u00a0=\u00a0255 in each plot). It is noticeable that according to the effort optimization hypothesis, arm kinematics (symmetry ratio) should not be invariant but instead linearly correlate with WGT.

For larger values of \u03b1, the symmetry ratio saturates at SR\u00a0=\u00a00.5. As illustrated, the higher the weight of the jerk, the flatter the correlation between symmetry ratio (SR) and WGT. This undeniably confirms the effort-related origin of the experimental findings presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>."

This is because the brain must compensate all perturbing dynamics to produce a consistent and invariant kinematically-defined motor plan (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hollerbach and Flash, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Atkeson and Hollerbach, 1985</a>), thus predicting constant SR values for all movement directions (<i>Jerk</i> prediction in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In contrast, the <i>Smooth-Effort</i> model minimizes a hybrid cost that, in addition to the <i>Jerk</i>, takes the external dynamics into account to minimize the muscular force needed to move the arm (absolute work of muscular torque). Thus, by design, the <i>Smooth-Effort</i> model implements the effort optimization strategy, whereby the brain uses the gravity internal model to predict and take advantage of gravity torques in accelerating and decelerating downward and upward movements, respectively (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berret et al., 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gaveau et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2014</a>). The effort optimization hypothesis predicts a sigmoidal dependence of SR on movement direction (<i>Smooth-Effort</i> prediction in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Critically, increasing the weight of movement smoothness (<i>Jerk</i>) in the <i>Smooth-Effort</i> hybrid cost, leads to a progressive disappearance of the gravity-torque related tuning of arm kinematics (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Accordingly, the compensation hypothesis predicts that movement kinematics remains unchanged for various gravity torque conditions (<i>Jerk</i> prediction in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), whilst the effort optimization hypothesis predicts that movement kinematics strongly correlates (average R\u00a0=\u00a00.99 [min: 0.986, max: 0.994], p&lt;1e-07) with the amount of gravity torque engaged in the motion (<i>Smooth-Effort</i> prediction in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Importantly, the SR dependence on movement direction (i.e., on gravity torque) is a unique feature of effort-related optimization as minimizing other cost functions that take joint torques into account, but are not directly related to effort, such as the <i>Variance</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Harris and Wolpert, 1998</a>) or <i>Torque Change</i> (<a href=\"#bib68\">Uno et al., 1989</a>), predict constant SR as a function of arm movement direction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> for additional simulations testing the effect of including muscle dynamics into the minimization of end-point <i>Variance</i>). In fact, minimization of an effort-related cost is a necessary and sufficient condition to predict directional asymmetries in the vertical plane (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berret et al., 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2008b</a>)."

Average duration did not vary with movement direction (0.40s \u00b1 0.01, SD; F<sub>16,224</sub>=0.67, p=0.82). Because arm movements were visually guided, systematic and variable errors were small and independent of movement direction (-2.5\u00b0&lt; SE &lt; 2\u00b0; VE &lt; 2.5\u00b0; F<sub>16,224</sub>=1.13, p=0.32 and F<sub>16,224</sub>=1.02, p=0.44, respectively). As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, SR shows a sigmoidal modulation as a function of movement direction (F<sub>16,224</sub>=28.36, p&lt;0.001). The robustness of this result is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, which shows sigmoidal fits for individual subjects (average RMSE = 9.77e-03 [min: 4.5e-03, max: 1.53e-02]). When SR was regressed against gravity torque, correlation coefficients were high, averaging R\u00a0=\u00a00.84 [min: 0.67, max: 0.92], p=2.5e-05 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Furthermore, SR was independent of movement duration and movement amplitude (average correlation coefficient for duration R\u00a0=\u00a00.22 [min: 0.04, max: 0.57], p=0.41, see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; for amplitude R\u00a0=\u00a00.29 [min: 0.02, max: 0.69], p=0.26, see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, arm kinematics is selectively modulated according to the gravity torque requirements of the movement, as predicted by the <i>Smooth-Effort</i> model and quantified by high correlation coefficients between predicted and experimental SR values (average R\u00a0=\u00a00.82 [min: 0.61, max: 0.91], p=5.6e-05; compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a> to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and C</a>, respectively).

As a further test, exploitation of microgravity environments (e.g., during the zero-G phase of parabolic flight) offers a powerful tool to interrogate neural vs. peripheral origins of the directional asymmetries. This is because during the repeated transitions to zero-G, gravity torque is temporarily eliminated. According to the effort optimization hypothesis, kinematic asymmetries should gradually but systematically decrease to zero, because a progressive re-optimization neural process should take place gradually over multiple zero-G transitions (<a href=\"#bib45\">McIntyre et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Izawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Snaterse et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, a peripheral origin of kinematic asymmetries leads to different predictions. Specifically, if directional asymmetries originate from flexor/extensor motoneuron properties, SR should not change during the zero-G phase of parabolic flight (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ishihara et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cotel et al., 2009</a>; for a review see <a href=\"#bib48\">Nagatomo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wilson et al., 2015</a>).

Simulations of a <i>Smooth-Effort</i> model, which minimizes a hybrid cost composed of the absolute work of muscular forces (mechanical energy expenditure) and jerk (inverse smoothness of the trajectory) can predict not only differences in upward/downward arm movements, but also the linear modulation of endpoint kinematics according to the gravity torque requirements of the movement. Because the smoothness term of the <i>Smooth-Effort</i> model corresponds to the <i>Jerk</i>, the <i>Smooth-Effort</i> model can be considered an expansion of the minimum <i>Jerk</i> requirement to include how task dynamics shapes movement kinematics. Yet, inclusion of an effort-related cost is a necessary and sufficient condition to predict directional asymmetries in the vertical plane (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berret et al., 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2008b</a>). Furthermore, minimizing other torque-related cost functions failed to predict direction-dependent kinematics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The present results therefore strongly support effort minimization in humans, further extending the growing idea that perceived effort plays an important role in the tailoring of human motor as well as non-motor behaviors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bramble and Lieberman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Walton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mazzoni et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carrier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kurzban et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Selinger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Farshchiansadegh et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shadmehr et al., 2016</a>)."

Also, the consistent observation of negative periods on the phasic activation of arm muscles, resulting from the subtraction of the hypothesized gravity-compensatory activity from the full muscle activation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Flanders et al., 1996</a>), suggest that muscular activity does not compensate gravity torque (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gaveau et al., 2013</a>)."

Even for movements in the horizontal plane, because the effort component of the cost function in the <i>Smooth-Effort</i> model is torque-dependent, the predictions of the Smooth-Effort model will change with the torque requirements of the movement. The minimum <i>Jerk</i> model predictions, however, will remain constant. Therefore, if interaction torques (for multi-degree of freedom arm movements) or additional external torques (produced by a robotic manipulandum for example) are experienced in the horizontal plane, the <i>Smooth-Effort</i> and <i>Jerk</i> model predictions would be different. Future experiments should test whether the need for optimization of work is limited to vertical movements pro or against gravity or, as we propose, represent a more general principle of motor control."

Briefly, 3 targets were centered on the participants\u2019 right shoulder (parasagittal plane) at a distance equal to the length of their fully extended arm. Participants were requested to perform fast visually guided upward and downward arm reaching movements (45\u00b0 shoulder rotation). Participants first performed arm movements in normal gravity during the flight (before parabolic maneuvers started, 40 trials for each movement direction) and then in microgravity during 5 parabolas (\u224875 trials, \u224815 trials per parabola). During the parabolic flight and based on pilots\u2019 instructions about the gravity force level, the experimenter verbally instructed participants when to start a block of reaching movements and when to stop. This was important to ensure that movements started and finished within zero-G conditions; i.e., participants made no movement in one-G or two-G conditions during or between parabolic manoeuvers. At the beginning of a block of movements within a parabola, participants repetitively reached between the middle, the upward, and the downward targets as follows: middle-upward (stopped for roughly 1\u00a0s), upward-middle (pause 1\u00a0s), middle-downward (pause 1\u00a0s), downward-middle (pause 1\u00a0s) and so on for approximately 15 trials. As initial position did not influence adaptation results across parabolas, movements with different initial positions were pooled together within each direction. The experiments were carried out during 4 different flights. Each flight was composed of thirty parabolas, each parabola consisting of three successive phases: (i) hypergravity ~ 1.8\u00a0g, (ii) microgravity ~ 0\u00a0g, and (iii) hypergravity again ~ 1.8\u00a0g. Each of those three phases lasted ~30\u2009s and the parabolas were separated by a time interval of ~ 2\u2009min. The whole flight lasted ~ 2\u2009hr.

Arm movements in both <i>Experiments</i> were recorded using an optoelectronic system of motion analysis (Smart, B.T.S., Italy) with 4 TV-cameras (120\u00a0Hz). Five reflective markers (diameter: 4\u2009mm) were placed on the shoulder (acromion), elbow (lateral epicondyle), wrist (middle of the wrist), hand (first metacarpo-phalangeal joint), and the nail of the index. Kinematics was recorded in three dimensions (<i>X, Y</i> and <i>Z</i>) and low-pass filtered (10\u00a0Hz) using a digital fifth-order Butterworth filter. The start and end of each movement was defined as the time at which finger tangential velocity went above or fell below 5% of maximum velocity. An automatic inspection of all trials revealed that shoulder angular velocity profiles were single-peaked and presented no motion (&lt;3\u00b0) from any other joint. Following this analysis, we calculated the subsequent kinematic parameters: (i) movement duration (<i>MD</i>), (ii) constant and variable angular final error and (iii) symmetry ratio (SR) of the finger velocity profile, defined as the ratio of acceleration time to total movement time (a ratio equal to 0.5 indicates temporally symmetric velocity profiles).

In <i>Experiment 2</i>, statistical comparisons were carried out by within-subjects two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. The factors were <i>direction</i> (2 levels) and <i>gravity-conditions</i> (six levels: 1g and 5 parabolas in 0g). For all statistical analyses, post-hoc differences were assessed with Scheff\u00e9's tests and significance was accepted at p&lt;0.05."

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. We apologize for the delay in coming to a decision, but it took a while for the reviews to come in, and then the editor and reviewers went through a fairly protracted consultation process to arrive at a decision. Basically, the reviewers all found the topic interesting and important, and felt that your work had a lot to contribute. At the same time, they felt that you have gone too far to claim its novelty and haven't pushed the analyses as far as might be suitable and useful. All of the reviewers agree that a substantial revision is warranted. The comments during the consultation session largely reiterated the comments in the reviews, so I am taking the unusual tack of forwarding the initial reviews, lightly edited, to you, and asking you to do the most thoughtful revision that addresses the substantive issues that the reviewers raised. This will probably require some additional data analysis and rewriting to do more justice to the models and accomplishments already in the literature."

More specifically, the authors tested whether the motor system attempts to overcome the gravitational force (compensation hypothesis) or rather exploits this passive force to control movement (optimization hypothesis). To disentangle between both hypotheses, the authors analyzed the kinematics of movements performed by human participants in different directions on Earth with predictions made by a mathematical model built on the basis of the optimal control framework. Furthermore, the authors had the unique opportunity to test these hypotheses by asking participants to perform similar movements in absence of gravitational constraint (microgravity), i.e. during parabolic flights. The results of both experiments (normogravity and microgravity) and the comparisons of real and simulated movements in both environments clearly supported the optimization hypothesis."

This was done perhaps on a voluntary basis because critics, even those that lead to progress, are not always welcome. However, because the goal of the study was \"to explicitly distinguish between the compensation and optimization hypotheses\", the discussion should be more explicit about problems regarding the compensation hypothesis. Despite the very nice results, without such a discussion, the impact of the present paper will be dampened."

The authors choose to cite papers that develop the model in full, rather than doing so here; that is a great disadvantage, as the reader cannot even consider the actual hypothesis suggested. What is suggested throughout is that \"effort\" is dominated by forces (here, gravity) (e.g. \"The behavioral signature of the optimal integration of gravity hypothesis\u2026\") The equations offered, however, show that jerk, a purely kinematic measure, is included in the authors' model. The sensitivity analysis, shown only in the discussion, is very incomplete, as it explores the calculated cost only on one side of the chosen coefficient. My best conclusion is that the jerk inclusion is crucial, and even the most generous reading of the work concludes with a synthesis, that both kinematics and dynamics are important in the present behavior."

The issue of what is being optimized in motor control has been attracting considerable attention through the last decades and no final resolution has been reached to date. Model predictions tend to be consistent with data within specific domains and in some ways this may not be an exception. The authors are considering the impact of gravity in the formation of arm trajectories and they frame the issue in the dichotomy between compensation and exploitation of gravitational torques in the generation of movement. To investigate how the motor system may take advantage of gravity in an optimal control approach, the authors consider a cost function expressing a tradeoff of effort and smoothness terms. They test the model in normal gravity and in microgravity and find evidence for a slow adaptive response when subjects perform repeated movements in the absence of gravity. The key metric considered in this work is the symmetry ratio (SR) expressing the temporal symmetry of acceleration and deceleration phases of simple reaching movements. The authors show that the symmetry ratio (as a function of movement direction and of gravitational work) follows a sigmoidal trend both in the model and in the experiments. Most importantly, the trend is gradually abolished when movements are carried out at zero-g. This is important, in my opinion, because it is not consistent with the possibility that the observed trend in normal gravity is due to an imperfect controller, attempting to implement a kinematic plan with a poor model of the gravitational field. The manuscript is well written, the comparison of the data with the model is done carefully and the conclusion that the data are supporting the idea that the motor controller exploits gravity to shape movement kinematics is convincing."

The smoothness model was proposed for planar horizontal movements that are unaffected by gravity. In this respect the model of Gaveau and colleagues does not seem an \"alternative\" to the minimum jerk model but an extension to cases in which gravity also comes into play. In a similar vein, I found not quite convincing and a bit artificial the suggested contrast between internal models and optimal control. In fact, internal models can be considered in the framework of optimal control, since they enable to predict the consequences of motor commands (forward models) and to form different optimal solutions of ill-posed inverse problems. What the authors consider as kinematics compensations (i.e. the formation of minimum jerk or minimum torque change trajectories) should not be described as alternative to optimization since they are also forms of optimization."

This sounds a bit like a political argument, where one takes the sides of a dynamical optimization against geometrical optimization. The fact is that the literature has shown evidence of both in different contexts. A case in point can be found in a recent study by Farshchansadegh and colleagues (PLoS Computational Biology 2016) who found evidence for both dynamic ad kinematic optimization under the same mechanical conditions, depending upon the agreement between visual and haptic feedback. That said, I am normally convinced that the essential value of a manuscript should be based on the results, not on how the authors want to organize the discussion. Broad speculations about the findings are a matter of choice and intellectual freedom of the authors. However, one should avoid statements that are inaccurate, such as the suggestion that \"the compensation hypothesis has critically lacked quantitative support.\" Perhaps this statement could only be justified by the fact that most researchers proposing that there are geometrical constraints in shaping the planning of multi articular reaching movements have not referred to this ide as \"the compensation hypothesis\"."

Furthermore, findings inconsistent with the compensation hypothesis (e.g., negative phasic EMG activity during vertical arm movements; Flanders et al., 1996) have been ignored\u201d (Discussion paragraph five). Previous studies that attempted to quantitatively validate the compensation hypothesis reported complex results that were not evaluated quantitatively with alternative hypotheses. Thus, even results inconsistent with the compensation hypothesis have been ignored. The recent application of optimal control theory to biological movement have allowed better quantification and interpretation of complex data sets, including the notion that motor adaptation corresponds to a re-optimization process giving rise to altered trajectories."

We have already shown this in a previous paper (Berret et al. 2008, PLoS Comp Biol). This is a logical result since, in both cases, minimizing the absolute work of forces will result in a control policy that produces as little co-contraction as possible. Separating agonist and antagonist torques would be interesting to test the effect of introducing some muscular dynamics (as we additionally did for the Minimum Variance Model, please see below), however, to allow meaningful interpretation of our results and reduce the number of unknown/tunable parameters, we used the simplest minimum smooth effort model without any muscular contraction dynamics. In doing so, the predicted directional asymmetries can surely be attributed to the rules of physics, i.e. gravity effects, and not to the specific muscular dynamics that we would implement.

(2004) in the sense that the system\u2019s degree of stability does not change with movement direction. The signal dependent noise (i.e. variance), accumulating with the muscular contractions responsible for movement acceleration and deceleration, actually reaches a constant final level for all movement directions in the gravity field (for a given duration and system\u2019s stability). As a result, velocity profiles, quantified by SR, are similar in all directions. This is a coherent result since the minimum variance penalizes large muscular torques that would be necessary to reproduce our experimental results; i.e. a short SR when moving upward (requiring strong acceleration against gravity and therefore high noise) and a long SR when moving downward (requiring strong deceleration against gravity and therefore high noise)."

In general, the prediction of the Smooth-Effort model will change with the torque requirement of the movement whilst the minimum Jerk prediction will not. Therefore, if interaction torques (for multi-degree of freedom arm movements) or additional external torques (produced by a robotic manipulandum for example) are experienced in the horizontal plane, the minimum Smooth-Effort and the minimum Jerk would predict very different solutions.

A purely kinematic optimization (such as the minimum Jerk) must take gravity effects into account in order to compensate them and therefore produce the desired trajectory (the smoothest one). On the other hand, an optimization criterion that considers movement dynamics will take advantage of gravity effects in order to produce trajectories that satisfy the desired minimization: endpoint variance, muscular effort or else. Therefore, in this study, we contrast kinematic and dynamic costs to disambiguate the compensation versus optimization hypothesis of gravity effects. Then we compare the predictions of various dynamic costs to emphasize the importance of effort in motor planning (Effort versus Variance or Torque Change)."

Furthermore, in previous studies (Berret et al. 2008a,b) an inverse optimal control approach mathematically demonstrated that the presence of an effort-related criterion in the cost function is a necessary and sufficient condition for the production of a brief transient muscle inactivation near the peak of velocity which induces the observed kinematic asymmetries with respect to movement direction.

In addition, direct optimal control simulations confirmed that other costs such as the integrals of squared torque change, torque, and jerk (Cartesian or angular) cannot consistently reproduce the robust empirical up/down asymmetries.

It can be appreciated that this approximation does not qualitatively change the results; i.e., the symmetry ratio still linearly correlates with the work of gravity torque. In conclusion, the approximation of <a href=\"#equ10\">Equation 10</a> does not remove the main angular dependence from gravity, i.e., according to the plane of motion, and the differences between the results obtained from the Smooth-Effort and the Variance models cannot be attributed to the approximation made in <a href=\"#equ10\">Equation 10</a>."

There is an alternate interpretation to early movements in parabolic flight, in which asymmetries mimic those on the ground. The reviewer rightly points out that actually experienced dynamics are very different, so the replication of asymmetry in kinematics is very odd. At the very least, this is evidence that actually-experienced gravity (or lack thereof) does not meaningfully influence control, and that the whole interpretation here is questionable. (It is a very curious result, at least).</i>"

However, to understand how the brain integrates gravity torque, one must consider the whole adaptation pattern, i.e., the initial values in 0g along with the following ones, not only the initial or final ones. Existing literature on motor adaption to microgravity or, more generally, to a new dynamical environment, allows better interpreting this result."

McIntyre J., ThonnardJ.-L and Lef\u00e8vre P., 2010 and 2014), such behavior (the persistence of 1g behavior in early 0g followed by progressive adaptation toward new values) could be interpreted as a stabilization of movement performance under internal model uncertainty. For example, in their 2010 paper, the above-mentioned authors observed that the grip force required to holding an object in the hand (pinched between thumb and index fingers) was kept similar to 1g values at the beginning of 0g exposition. Then, grip force was observed to slowly decrease toward new optimal values across parabolas. Theoretical simulations revealed that this adaptation dynamics reflects the stabilization of movement performance when the internal model of gravity is changing (uncertain). More generally, this stabilization concords with the first of a dual adaptation process previously proposed by Izawa J., Rane T., Donchin O. and Shadmehr R., 2008: \u201con the one hand, adaptation produces a more accurate estimate of the sensory consequences of the motor commands (i.e., learn an accurate forward model), and on the other hand, our brain searches for a better movement plan so to minimize an implicit motor cost and maximize rewards (i.e., find an optimum controller)\u201d."

This sounds a bit like a political argument, where one takes the sides of a dynamical optimization against geometrical optimization. The fact is that the literature has shown evidence of both in different contexts. A case in point can be found in a recent study by Farshchansadegh and colleagues (PLoS Computational Biology 2016) who found evidence for both dynamic ad kinematic optimization under the same mechanical conditions, depending upon the agreement between visual and haptic feedback. That said, I am normally convinced that the essential value of a manuscript should be based on the results, not on how the authors want to organize the discussion. Broad speculations about the findings are a matter of choice and intellectual freedom of the authors. However, one should avoid statements that are inaccurate, such as the suggestion that \"the compensation hypothesis has critically lacked quantitative support.\" Perhaps this statement could only be justified by the fact that most researchers proposing that there are geometrical constraints in shaping the planning of multi articular reaching movements have not referred to this ide as \"the compensation hypothesis\".</i>"
