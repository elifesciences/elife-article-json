Here, we describe a mechanism whereby the neurotrophic factor NGF and the transcription factor Runx1 coordinate postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, a major nociceptor subtype. We show that the integrity of a Runx1/CBF\u03b2 holocomplex is crucial for NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. NGF signals through the ERK/MAPK pathway to promote expression of <i>Cbfb</i> but not <i>Runx1</i> prior to maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In contrast, transcriptional initiation of <i>Runx1</i> in nonpeptidergic nociceptor precursors is dependent on the homeodomain transcription factor Islet1, which is largely dispensable for <i>Cbfb</i> expression. Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBF\u03b2 pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBF\u03b2 holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control heterodimeric transcription factor complex formation provides a robust mechanism for postmitotic neuronal subtype specification."
