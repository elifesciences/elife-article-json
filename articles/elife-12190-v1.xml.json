Here we show in two evolutionarily distant vertebrates (<i>Xenopus laevis</i> cell culture and mouse nerve-muscle ex-vivo) that the skeletal muscle cell constantly senses, through two identified calcium signals, synaptic events and their efficacy in eliciting spikes. These sensors trigger retrograde signal(s) that control presynaptic neurotransmitter release, resulting in synaptic potentiation or depression. In the absence of spikes, synaptic events trigger potentiation. Once the synapse is sufficiently strong to initiate spiking, the occurrence of these spikes activates a negative retrograde feedback. These opposing signals dynamically balance the synapse in order to continuously adjust neurotransmitter release to a level matching current muscle cell excitability."

Here we show in two evolutionarily distant vertebrates (<i>Xenopus laevis</i> cell culture and mouse nerve-muscle ex-vivo) that the skeletal muscle cell constantly senses, through two identified calcium signals, synaptic events and their efficacy in eliciting spikes. These sensors trigger retrograde signal(s) that control presynaptic neurotransmitter release, resulting in synaptic potentiation or depression. In the absence of spikes, synaptic events trigger potentiation. Once the synapse is sufficiently strong to initiate spiking, the occurrence of these spikes activates a negative retrograde feedback. These opposing signals dynamically balance the synapse in order to continuously adjust neurotransmitter release to a level matching current muscle cell excitability."

Experiments in two distantly related animals \u2013 mice and embryos from a frog called <i>Xenopus</i> \u2013 revealed that muscle cells use two calcium-based signals. The first is the flow of calcium ions into the muscle cell in response to binding of neurotransmitter to receptors at the synapses: this tells the muscle cell how active the nerve cell is. The second is the release of calcium ions from internal stores inside the muscle cell: this occurs whenever neurotransmitter release is sufficient to activate the muscle cell."

In response to the second signal, the muscle cell sends negative feedback to reduce neurotransmitter release. Thus, when neurotransmitter release is not enough to activate the muscle, positive feedback dominates and neurotransmitter release increases. However, when the muscle is activated, the two types of feedback act in balance to maintain efficient communication across the synapse."

There is a large diversity of plasticity processes, which together shape the neuronal network (<a href=\"#bib6\">Changeux and Danchin, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goda and Davis, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Munz et al., 2014</a>) and tune its properties (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nelson and Turrigiano, 2008</a>). In the brain, concomitantly to various forms of associative plasticity which sustain memory and learning, homeostatic plasticity processes are proposed to restrain the mean level of neuronal activity within a physiological regime, and to maintain the stability of recurrent network activity that can be challenged by associative plasticity (<a href=\"#bib75\">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Macleod and Zinsmaier, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Turrigiano, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Nelson and Turrigiano, 2008</a>). Homeostatic plasticity has been extensively studied at the neuromuscular synapse, in particular at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Frank, 2014</a>), due to the robustness of the homeostatic control of synaptic transmission and the great accessibility of the experimental model to genetic manipulations."

The stability of the gain implies that presynaptic neurotransmitter release and/or postsynaptic receptors adapt the effective synaptic strength to the excitability of the muscle fiber, which depends on the fiber characteristics, and presumably decreases with growth and exercise (<a href=\"#bib76\">Turrigiano, 2007</a>). In adult vertebrate skeletal muscles, cholinergic nicotinic receptors are clustered in the synaptic region. Expression and location of nicotinic receptors have been shown to depend not only on agrin (<a href=\"#bib49\">McMahan, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hall and Sanes, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gautam et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sandrock et al., 1997</a>) but also on activity (<a href=\"#bib43\">L\u00f8mo, 2003</a>), suggesting their possible role as adjustment variables in the control of synaptic strength. In the recent years however, thorough studies of the glutamatergic NMJ in <i>Drosophila</i> revealed that presynaptic regulation of neurotransmitter release is certainly a major adjustment variable for synaptic homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davis and M\u00fcller, 2015</a>). In such 'presynaptic homeostasis', increase in neurotransmitter release counterbalances a genetically-induced decrease of the postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate (<a href=\"#bib61\">Petersen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Davis et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">DiAntonio et al., 1999</a>), a genetically-induced increase of postsynaptic input conductance (<a href=\"#bib58\">Paradis et al., 2001</a>) or a pharmacological blockade of postsynaptic receptors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Frank et al., 2006</a>), thus resulting in the strict maintenance of the level of evoked postsynaptic depolarization. Presynaptic compensation of postsynaptic excitability changes implies the existence of a retrograde feedback process from the innervated muscle fiber to the motor neuron. Particular attention was paid to the determination of the molecular targets of the homeostatic retrograde signaling and of the presynaptic cell signaling involved. It appeared that both the readily releasable vesicle pool (<a href=\"#bib55\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">2015</a>) and the presynaptic voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib54\">M\u00fcller and Davis, 2012</a>) are targeted to promote glutamate release when postsynaptic excitability is reduced. The abundance of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can also be decreased in response to a vesicular content increase (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gavi\u00f1o et al., 2015</a>), confirming the bi-directionality of the process. In <i>Drosophila</i>, endostatin is a candidate trans-synaptic factor for the retrograde feedback targeting presynaptic neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Upstream from the retrograde factors, the postsynaptic kinases, CAMKII (<a href=\"#bib28\">Haghighi et al., 2003</a>) and TOR (<a href=\"#bib59\">Penney et al., 2012</a>), pathways are necessary for a functional homeostatic control at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular transmission."

However, besides the nature of the retrograde feedback and its presynaptic targets, a mechanism for the evaluation of the synaptic strength should be present at the postsynaptic level. The nature and dynamics of these mechanisms, primarily sensing synaptic strength in the muscle cell and initiating retrograde feedback, are key issues of homeostatic plasticity that still remain enigmatic in both invertebrates and vertebrates."

Standard intracellular recording from muscle cells is possible in <i>Xenopus</i> culture owing to the small size of the cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, perforated patch-clamp), while it is not possible in muscle cells from adult mice, due to macroscopic movements during contraction. To circumvent this issue and maintain intracellular recordings in moving tissue, we adapted a \u2018floating electrode\u2019 device from previous methods invented for muscles (<a href=\"#bib84\">Woodbury and Brady, 1956</a>) or neurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kunze, 1998</a>).

In vertebrate muscle cells, the amplitude of PSPs depends on the ratio between the nicotinic conductance activated by acetylcholine (ACh) and the muscle input conductance, which is largely due to resting K<sup>+</sup> leak currents. Fibers in flexor digitorum brevis (FDB), extensor digitorum longus and soleus mouse muscles have a wide distribution of input conductances (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A similar distribution in <i>Xenopus</i> muscle cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, X axis) is linked to the diversity of membrane surfaces with homogenous conductance density (196 \u00b1 14 pS/pF, n=19, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Despite these differences in muscle cell excitability, a single presynaptic AP triggered a single postsynaptic AP, and a contraction, in all tested cells from <i>Xenopus</i> and mouse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In <i>Xenopus</i> cultures, we found that the nicotinic conductance activated in muscle cells by spike-evoked ACh release varied linearly with the postsynaptic input conductances measured in a population of synaptic neuron/muscle cell pairs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), and resulted in comparable ePSP (evoked PSP) voltage amplitudes. Similarly, in mouse muscles, we assessed ePSP characteristics after exogenous application of \u00b5-conotoxin GIIIB which selectively blocks Na<sup>+</sup><sub>v</sub>1.4 channels involved in the muscle cell AP (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cruz et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2003</a>). This manipulation does not affect nerve APs, since this Na<sup>+</sup> channel subtype is not critical for spiking in motor neurons. Single-spike-evoked PSPs exhibited a narrow range of voltage magnitudes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, in FDB muscle). The comparable amplitude of ePSPs, despite widely ranging resting conductances in the postsynaptic muscle cells, indicates that the neuromuscular synapse exhibits robust plasticity that regulates its functional strength within a narrow range."

Previous research reported that in <i>Xenopus</i> cell cultures, burst activation of presynaptic input results in marked enhancement of ACh release, in both voltage-clamp and current-clamp conditions (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wan and Poo, 1999</a>). We reproduced this result in the specific condition of post-synaptic voltage-clamp (not shown) but not in that of current-clamp where we found instead absence of potentiation. To observe such absence in current-clamp, we believe that it is essential that all or most of the ePSPs evoked by the conditioning burst, reach threshold for spike initiation in the postsynaptic cell. This was not the case in the only example of current-clamp presented by <a href=\"#bib77\">Wan and Poo 1999</a> (see their <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>(i)). Homeostatic plasticity rules suggest in fact that this form of plasticity should not occur in the presence of synaptic transmission that is effective in generating a muscle AP. To test this hypothesis, we initiated burst stimulation of motor neurons in both <i>Xenopus</i> and mice \u2013during current-clamp recordings\u2013 in order to allow voltage responses and APs in the muscle cells. In these physiological conditions and despite the chronic burst activity, no significant change in the synaptic gain was visible. The probability for a synaptic event to induce a postsynaptic AP was close to unity and kept constant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In <i>Xenopus</i> however, test evoked postsynaptic currents (ePSCs) were recorded under brief periods of postsynaptic voltage-clamp before and after the 30\u2009min of chronic activity under current-clamp, and showed a slight relative decrease of 0.2 in the averaged ePSCs amplitude (see first bar in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In mice, the average ePSPs were not changed by high-frequency conditioning stimulations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3F</a>). Altogether, these observations suggest that synapses able to trigger postsynaptic APs do not exhibit strong plasticity, and that the occurrence of muscle APs may be involved in the homeostatic mechanisms adjusting and maintaining the synaptic strength in concordance with the postsynaptic input conductance."

                                "text": "How might the strength of synaptic transmission depend upon the occurrence of an AP in the postsynaptic muscle cell? We reasoned that there may be two distinct postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways involved in this homeostatic regulation: a postsynaptic reporter of the presynaptic activity that signals the occurrence of a synaptic event, and a postsynaptic reporter that signals the occurrence of a postsynaptic AP. The postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> build up (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013F</a>) due to a high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of the nicotinic receptor-channel (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fucile et al., 2006</a>) (PCa<sup>2+</sup>/PNa<sup>+</sup>=0.23 in <i>Xenopus</i>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) is a good candidate for signaling the occurrence of synaptic events. Furthermore, in vertebrates, the skeletal muscle cells exhibit a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal linked to the AP and involved in the excitation-contraction coupling, <i>i.e.</i> 'the depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release' (DICR). The DICR signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors, triggered by plasma membrane depolarizations above \u201340 mV, and thus triggered by AP in physiological conditions. Depolarization is detected by a voltage-sensor (the dihydropyridine receptor) located in the plasma membrane. This voltage-sensor derives from an L-Type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel; it is voltage-dependent but not ion permeable (<a href=\"#bib1\">Almers et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Melzer et al., 1995</a>). Functionally linked to the ryanodine receptor at the level of the T-tubule, its activation triggers the opening of the ryanodine receptor (<a href=\"#bib66\">Rios and Brum, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Catterall, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Franzini-Armstrong and Protasi, 1997</a>). The resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is independent of the extra-cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), purely voltage-dependent, and its voltage-dependency follows the typical pattern of the activation curve of a 'High Voltage-Activated' Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Ryanodine fully blocks this Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We hypothesized that these two distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DICR, are used by the muscle cell to detect synaptic activity and its efficiency to elicit an AP, respectively, leading to retrograde control of the presynaptic ACh release (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> scheme). To validate this hypothesis, we examined each of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent mechanisms in isolation and their respective impact on synaptic efficacy."

To trigger the nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx but not the DICR in <i>Xenopus</i> muscle cells, we transiently reduced synaptic strength below AP threshold during the conditioning presynaptic burst stimulations performed in postsynaptic current-clamp. We monitored subsequent synaptic conductance changes under postsynaptic voltage-clamp during low-rate single-pulse intracellular stimulation of the neuron. We reduced the synaptic efficacy either by decreasing the synaptic conductance with low-doses of the reversible nicotinic antagonist curare (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>), or by artificially increasing the muscle cell input conductance using dynamic-clamp (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sharp et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Robinson and Kawai, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Prinz et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figures supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig3s2\">2A</a>). The lowered synaptic conductance mimicked the effects of low ACh release in developing synapses. Simulation and dynamic-clamp injection of a combination of a linear and an inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> leak conductances (Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) mimicked the increased endogenous input conductance associated with muscle cell growth. In both cases, presynaptic burst-stimulation (3 bursts of 5 pulses at 30\u2009Hz) induced a strong, fast (within minutes) and long-term potentiation (LTP) of ePSCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), while the transient application of curare in absence of presynaptic stimulation did not induce potentiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, 'curare No Burst' bar). This form of LTP induced by subthreshold synaptic events depends solely on nicotinic receptor activity and therefore was insensitive to DICR blockade obtained by pre-loading the muscle cell with ryanodine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Furthermore, when ePSPs were left intact but in presence of postsynaptic ryanodine, presynaptic burst-stimulation produced postsynaptic APs and nonetheless a strong LTP of the ePSCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), while no potentiation occurred when DICR was functional (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The LTP induced in our postsynaptic current-clamp protocols was accompanied with a strong increase of the frequency, but not amplitude, of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>). As previously observed in voltage-clamp protocols (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wan and Poo, 1999</a>), this indicates that LTP is due to an evoked ACh release increase and not to a postsynaptic receptor modulation. We found similar results in ryanodine-treated mouse muscles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>): it is only when nicotinic channels were activated following conditioning bursts of nerve stimulations and ACh release \u2014in the absence of DICR and contraction\u2014 that subsequent single test pulses revealed a strong LTP of the ePSPs. In contrast, as shown above, when DICR was functional and the nerve was stimulated, nicotinic ePSPs did not change and remained identical to those in the absence of nerve stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Therefore the simultaneous occurrence of postsynaptic nicotinic receptor activation and DICR is essential to the stability of functional synaptic gain. Because the regulation targets ACh release, this implies the existence of retrograde feedback onto the presynaptic compartment."

LTD induced by repetitive postsynaptic depolarizations has been previously reported (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lo et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dan et al., 1995</a>). Here we show that this form of LTD relies strictly on DICR: it was insensitive to removal of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and blocked by postsynaptic pre-loading with ryanodine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In adult mouse nerve-muscle preparations, external electrical stimulation elicits an AP in both the nerve and the muscle fibers, a situation in which both DICR and nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx occur. As expected, in the presence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the external burst stimulation did not change the average ePSP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E, F</a>) compared to nerve stimulation only (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). When the external Ca<sup>2+</sup> was transiently removed, the external stimulation still elicited APs in both the nerve and the muscle, but neither the ACh release nor its associated postsynaptic nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. In these conditions, the external stimulation induced DICR alone and resulted in a strong LTD of the ePSPs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). This form of depression is reversible, since subsequent burst stimulation of the nerve induced a rapid potentiation of the ePSPs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, we observed in non-treated <i>Xenopus</i> synapses that 30\u2009min of chronic burst stimulation of the motor neuron did not drastically change the synaptic gain, but nevertheless induced a slight depression of the averaged ePSCs. Next, we set to closely examine these small synaptic changes in individual synapses. Given the variety of average synaptic conductance among neuromuscular synapses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, Y axis), and its strong correlation with the muscle input conductance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), the range of the ratio between the synaptic and the input conductances 'Gsyn/Gin' is much tighter than the synaptic conductance range. We reasoned that because this ratio, and not the synaptic conductance alone, determines the synaptic efficacy (ePSP amplitude), it should be the appropriate synaptic parameter targeted by the homeostatic process. Therefore, we recorded the ePSCs under brief test periods of postsynaptic voltage-clamp, before and after 20\u201330\u2009min of chronic burst stimulation of the motor-neuron under postsynaptic current-clamp, and normalized these averaged ePSCs by the input conductance of the muscle cell. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> (black dots) shows that the slight depression was not homogenous among neuromuscular synapses. The degree of depression seems to depend on the distance of the initial Gsyn/Gin ratio from the mean ratio obtained after chronic activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, dashed line). Consequently, standard deviation from the mean is reduced after chronic activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, inset). This synaptic depression behavior can be interpreted as the convergence of the Gsyn/Gin ratios towards the set point of the homeostasis."

At this curare concentration, the synaptic activity is still composed of a majority of suprathreshold events, combining both nicotinic and DICR calcium signals. We took advantage of the fact that the muscle contraction force integrates the synaptic efficacy over all the fibers of the muscle and all the synaptic events of the bursts, and as such is an indicator of even small changes in the synaptic gain. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> shows the 26% decrease in the contraction force due to low curare, followed by progressive recovery of the force back to a normal level in response to subsequent nerve burst stimulations.

Two distinct calcium signals report the pre- and postsynaptic activity. Synaptic events are detected through the nicotinic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and trigger a positive retrograde feedback that targets presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Postsynaptic APs are detected through the sarcoplasmic reticulum DICR signal and trigger a negative retrograde feedback. In <i>Xenopus</i>, convergence of the synaptic efficacy \u2014here captured by the ratio between the synaptic and the input conductances\u2014 towards an attractor set point located in the suprathreshold range of synaptic efficacy suggests that a dynamic balance between the potentiating and depressing synaptic processes ensures homeostasis of the neuromuscular transmission. This equilibrium automatically sets the neurotransmitter release to a level matching the postsynaptic excitability. Obviously, ACh release is not the only actor of synaptic efficacy, nicotinic receptors density and muscle input conductance being also under control. However, the advantages of the calcium sensors-based plasticity of presynaptic release are its dynamical aspect and its fast kinetics, confirming in vertebrates that rapid adjustment of the neurotransmitter release is a primary variable in the homeostatic control of neuromuscular synaptic efficacy (<a href=\"#bib62\">Plomp et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Petersen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Davis et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">DiAntonio et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Paradis et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Frank et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Davis and M\u00fcller, 2015</a>)."

The two antagonist calcium signals that we demonstrated here to be involved in the orientation of the neuromuscular plasticity exhibit different temporal patterns and amplitudes. The AP-associated DICR signal exhibits fast transient large calcium concentration elevations for each AP. The kinetics of the nicotinic calcium build-up is much slower and does not contain transients during repetitive nicotinic receptor stimulations. Its amplitude under voltage-clamp is low compare to the DICR signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), and even lower under current-clamp given the reduced driving-force for the calcium ion due to the postsynaptic depolarization. This dichotomy between fast large transient and slow low calcium build-up is known to trigger selectively, <i>via</i> calmodulin, the CAMKII kinase and the calcineurin phosphatase respectively. This mechanism is considered in the central nervous system to implement Hebbian plasticity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Malenka et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Malinow et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mulkey et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">1994</a>) by modulating the conductance and number of the postsynaptic receptors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barria et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mammen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beattie et al., 2000</a>). The CAMKII signaling pathway was also shown to be required for normal 'presynaptic homeostasis' in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Haghighi et al., 2003</a>). Furthermore, <a href=\"#bib77\">Wan and Poo 1999</a> showed at the <i>Xenopus</i> synapse in vitro that induction of LTP and LTD can be blocked by pre-loading the muscle cell with peptide inhibitors of calcineurin and CAMKII respectively. As noted by <a href=\"#bib77\">Wan and Poo 1999</a>, this situation is opposite to the central synapses, where calcineurin is associated to depression and CAMKII to potentiation. Our results suggest that the low-calcium nicotinic signal and the calcineurin activation have a possible causal link with the detection of the synaptic events and the synaptic potentiation, while the high-calcium DICR signal and the CAMKII activation are associated with the detection of the postsynaptic APs and the synaptic depression."

These observations strongly suggest that the set point of the homeostatic plasticity is sustained by a push-pull mechanism. Our results, however, do not determine the stages where this push-pull mechanism could operate in the causal chain linking the evaluation of synaptic efficacy to the presynaptic modulation. In particular, our findings do not necessarily imply that two independent antagonist trans-synaptic retrograde factors balance their effects at the presynaptic level. The coexistence of potentiating and depressing trans-synaptic factors is a possibility among others. The increased and decreased secretion of a single positive retrograde factor \u2014like for example endostatin in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wang et al., 2014</a>) and neurotrophins in vertebrates\u2014 could also bi-directionally regulate neurotransmitter release. In this case, it could be hypothesized that a push-pull mechanism operates downstream of the calcium signaling, for example at the level of the calcineurin/CAMKII balance, ultimately determining the secretion level of a single factor. Therefore, the use of blue and red arrows in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> is intended as a schematic representation of the retrograde mechanisms that can bi-directionally change neurotransmitter release, without presuming the existence of two distinct retrograde factors."

Therefore, the spontaneous ACh release did not restore the normal Gsyn/Gin ratio (found in non-treated synapses) before chronic bursts were applied. A possible explanation of this difference between the two systems is the high frequency of miniatures in <i>Drosophila</i> (10\u201320\u2009Hz) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Frank et al., 2006</a>), while the average frequency of spontaneous release in the <i>Xenopus</i> cells culture was 100 fold lower.

Because of the robustness of its synaptic transmission, the neuromuscular junction is considered as a model of homeostasis. However, the neuromuscular junction being the end effector of the motor network, its main function is the faithful translation of the motor command into muscle activity. The mean level of muscle activity is not involved in any recurrent network that requires stability, and therefore does not need to be controlled. While the synaptic strength is the adjustment variable for the control of the mean level of neuronal activity in the CNS, at the NMJ it is the efficacy of synaptic transmission itself that must be maintained constant for reliable relay of the motor command. Therefore, homeostatic plasticity could be regarded as a functionally different phenomenon at the NMJ than in the CNS. Nevertheless, the plasticity orientation rule described in the present work matches a synaptic 'relay' function. Despite differences in the nature of the activity sensors, other 'relay' synapses in the CNS, such as those involved in sensory inputs to the thalamus (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guido, 2008</a>), might share with the NMJ a comparable homeostatic control based on pre- and post- synaptic activity detection."

Myocyte membrane currents were filtered with an integrated low-pass Bessel filter at 2 kHz. The filtered signals were digitized by a 12 bit A/D converter (Digidata 1200B, <i>ibid.</i>) and stored using pCLAMP 8 software (<i>ibid.</i>). Recordings were analyzed using the Origin 7 software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Motor neurons were current-clamped through an amphotericin-perforated membrane patch (400\u2009pA, 3 ms current step to induce the presynaptic AP); the intra-pipette solution had the following composition (in mM): 1 NaCl, 140\u2009K-gluconate, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH=7.2), and amphotericin-B at 300 \u00b5g/ml.

With the floating electrode method, the placement of the electrode is not precisely controlled. We limited the distance effect by using the FDB mouse muscle, where cells are shorter (300 \u00b5m) than the muscle length (1 cm). Therefore, blind placement of the electrode can be performed on this muscle, with a maximal 150 \u00b5m distance between the recording site and the end plate. The specific cells size and organization in FDB limit the distance effect in our recordings, but this effect is presumably responsible for an underestimation of the ePSPs amplitudes and for most of the variability between the recorded cells. Despite the underestimation of the ePSPs amplitudes, the recorded amplitudes were above the -63 mV AP threshold determined in muscle cells of rat fast and slow muscles (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wood and Slater, 1995</a>)."

This point needs shoring up both with further discussion and with controls for the effects of curare incubation and/or changes in input conductance on ACh release in the absence of bursting. With respect to further discussion, the authors need to do a better job of explaining other differences between this data set and previous studies such as those of Paradis et al. 2001, Frank et al. 2006, Petersen et al. 1997; Cull-Candy et al. 1979 and 1980; Plomp et al. 1992 and Plomp and Molenaar 1996."

Or is bulk unloading to the SR with thapsigargin sufficient to induce LTD? Overall, the authors need to strengthen their argument that this system is truly homeostatic. Similarly, is there a threshold level of nicotinic calcium required to induce LTP? Is there any freq dependence? Given previous observations from <i>Drosophila</i> and patients with myasthenia gravis, it might be expected that sub-blocking levels of curare would induce increased ACh release independent of bursting. Thus, an important control for the curare experiments is whether curare incubation in the absence of bursting or with chronic activity results in LTP."

Since in the <i>Xenopus</i> cell culture the nicotinic receptors are not limited to the synaptic region, ionophoretic ACh application may mimic a competing synapse. This situation may be more related to synaptic competition and hetero-synaptic depression than to plasticity at mono-innervated muscle cell. Nicotinic calcium may have different effects when induced by another synapse. This idea is supported by the fact that Dan &amp; Poo obtained depression with ionophoretic ACh alone and not when ACh was applied under postsynaptic Vclamp concomitantly with the pre-synaptic stimulation, while in this case nicotinic calcium build up should have been more important (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> of Dan &amp; Poo 1992)."

For a given membrane surface, the increased permeability combined with the opposite voltage-dependency resulted in a bell-shape relationship between the nicotinic calcium and the synaptic conductance (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 3B</a>). As an illustration, simulations show that for a burst of 5 synaptic events at 20-30 Hz with a conductance producing a 1.5 nA synaptic current at a holding potential close to the resting potential, the use of Vclamp increases by 5 times the nicotinic calcium compared to Iclamp. In other words, under Iclamp the nicotinic calcium during this burst is equivalent of that provided under Vclamp by a much weaker synaptic conductance producing -300 pA of current. Therefore, the range of nicotinic calcium mobilized under Iclamp is globally in the range mobilized under Vclamp by low synaptic conductances which induce potentiation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>, black dots). Finally, the AP-induced DICR, known to be largest calcium signal in skeletal muscle cells, might be more susceptible than the nicotinic calcium to reach under IClamp the high level of calcium necessary to activate CAMKII and to induce depression."

The literature on <i>Drosophila</i> focuses mainly on the presynaptic expression of the homeostatic potentiation, and not on the postsynaptic mechanisms of evaluation of synaptic efficacy leading to the homeostasis.

Given the fact that both forms of plasticity have previously been described and what is novel here is the interaction between the two it seems reasonable to insist on a better characterization of that interaction. This could be performed along one or both of the following dimensions: A) Timing: Is the plasticity \"gated\" by SR calcium release or is there a temporal dependence to this mechanism? A tight temporal requirement would support that the gating mechanism is occurring within the muscle cell. Demonstrating a shared cellular localization for the convergence of these processes would strengthen the argument that LTD regulates/gates the LTP. Related to this point, is it surprising that the LTD is so stable in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> given that the ePSPs seem to all fail to reach threshold? Shouldn't this induce LTP? B) Gradation: It is predicted that homeostatic regulation of PSP amplitudes would require a graded response to provide needed precision to the regulation (Davis, 2006). This should be demonstrated. Is either of the signals or their respective outputs graded? This could be revealed by investigating the freq dependence and/or the number of postsynaptic depolarizations required to generate LTD (Dan and Poo, Science 1992). Or is bulk unloading to the SR with thapsigargin sufficient to induce LTD? Overall, the authors need to strengthen their argument that this system is truly homeostatic. Similarly, is there a threshold level of nicotinic calcium required to induce LTP? Is there any freq dependence? Given previous observations from Drosophila and patients with myasthenia gravis, it might be expected that sub-blocking levels of curare would induce increased ACh release independent of bursting. Thus, an important control for the curare experiments is whether curare incubation in the absence of bursting or with chronic activity results in LTP.</i>"

We reasoned that in the case of a \u201cgating mechanism\u201d, supra-threshold events would have been neutral in terms of plasticity (\u201cshut off plasticity\u201d), and thus the remaining 20% of sub-threshold events would have potentiated the synapse up to gain 1. Instead of that, the synaptic gain slightly decreased (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) due to a slight depression of the averaged synaptic currents (0.2, subsection \u201cA stable synaptic gain \u201cof the initial manuscript).

In order to show that the calcium release from reticulum through the ryanodine receptors induce synaptic depression we have directly triggered the muscle AP in absence of pre-synaptic stimulation. However, in the natural circumstances this situation occurs only in multi-innervated muscle cells, during development. In our work we did not investigate the possible role of the AP-associated calcium signal in heterosynaptic depression, a hypothesis which remains to be tested. It is tempting to hypothesize that if the global DICR signal (activated across the whole fiber) is associated with the release by all the muscle surface of a negative retrograde feedback factor, it could participate to the depression of the less active synapses in the case of a competition.
