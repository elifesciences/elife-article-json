We did a pilot clinical investigation, including a nonrandomized (57 patients with large HCC) and a randomized controlled (20 patients with large HCC) studies. <b>Methods:</b> The patients were treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with or without bicarbonate local infusion into tumor. <b>Results:</b> In the nonrandomized controlled study, geometric mean of viable tumor residues (VTR) in TACE with bicarbonate was 6.4-fold lower than that in TACE without bicarbonate (7.1% [95% CI: 4.6%\u201310.9%] vs 45.6% [28.9%\u201372.0%]; p&lt;0.0001). This difference was recapitulated by a subsequent randomized controlled study. TACE combined with bicarbonate yielded a 100% objective response rate (ORR), whereas the ORR treated with TACE alone was 44.4% (nonrandomized) and 63.6% (randomized). The survival data suggested that bicarbonate may bring survival benefit. <b>Conclusion:</b> Bicarbonate markedly enhances the anticancer activity of TACE."

We did a pilot clinical investigation, including a nonrandomized (57 patients with large HCC) and a randomized controlled (20 patients with large HCC) studies. <b>Methods:</b> The patients were treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with or without bicarbonate local infusion into tumor. <b>Results:</b> In the nonrandomized controlled study, geometric mean of viable tumor residues (VTR) in TACE with bicarbonate was 6.4-fold lower than that in TACE without bicarbonate (7.1% [95% CI: 4.6%\u201310.9%] vs 45.6% [28.9%\u201372.0%]; p&lt;0.0001). This difference was recapitulated by a subsequent randomized controlled study. TACE combined with bicarbonate yielded a 100% objective response rate (ORR), whereas the ORR treated with TACE alone was 44.4% (nonrandomized) and 63.6% (randomized). The survival data suggested that bicarbonate may bring survival benefit. <b>Conclusion:</b> Bicarbonate markedly enhances the anticancer activity of TACE."

An alternative option to kill the tumor is to block its blood supply via a process called embolization. This procedure deprives the tumor cells of oxygen and nutrients such as glucose. However, embolization also prevents a chemical called lactic acid \u2013 which is commonly found around tumors \u2013 from being removed. Lactic acid actually helps to protect cancer cells and also aids the growth of new blood vessels, and so the \u201ctrapped\u201d lactic acid may reduce the anticancer activity of embolization."

First, lactic acidosis dramatically reduces glycolysis rate with little wasting glucose to lactate, as such, a limited amount of glucose could support cancer cells for a relatively long time otherwise would be exhausted quickly. Second, when glucose was deprived, lactic acidosis transformed cancer cells to a \u2018dormant\u2019 state, via arresting cells at G0/G1 phase, initiating autophagy, inhibiting apoptosis, etc. The protective function relies on co-presence of lactate and proton, depriving either of which would abolish the function (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Xie et al., 2014</a>).

TACE kills HCC via 2 mechanisms, delivering concentrated anticancer drugs locally into tumor and occluding tumor feeding arteries to deprive nutrients to starve cancer cells. We would focus on the second mechanism. Occluding tumor feeding arteries effectively deprive nutrients including glucose. The problem is that embolization-created hypoxia condition would stimulate cancer cells to emit strong signals to initiate angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Knox et al., 2015</a>) to reestablish tumor vasculature to bypass the occluded tumor feeding arteries. If the tumor cells cannot be rapidly eliminated, tumor vasculature would be re-established, and a certain amount of tumor (ranging from a few percent of the original tumor to even a larger tumor known as progressive disease) would survive and thrive. The lactate concentrations in HCC biopsies were around 20\u2009mM (unpublished data), suggesting a lactic acidosis condition. After TACE, lactic acidosis would be trapped in embolized tumor and it would potentially attenuate the therapeutic efficacy of TACE. If it were true, locally infusion of bicarbonate to neutralize it would result in a severer necrosis in the embolized area."

It is known that large size of HCC is a major obstacle to limit the therapeutic efficacy of TACE (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sieghart et al., 2015</a>), the larger the tumor size, the poorer the efficacy of TACE. Thus, the large HCC is a perfect tumor model to test our hypothesis. If intratumoral lactic acidosis is responsible for the therapeutic limitation, locally neutralizing it should significantly improve the anticancer activity, which can be quantitatively measured by the viable tumor residues. To the best of our knowledge, assessment of the necrosis of tumor after the first treatment is probably most objective with least interferences of known and unknown factors.

The total objective response rate (complete or partial responses) in the cTACE group was 44.4%, whereas it was 100% in the TILA-TACE group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

When patient number was 10 for each group, the estimated power value reached 0.826. In 2014, we recruited and randomly assigned twenty patients with large HCC (5.0 \u2013 13.5 cm) into cTACE (n=10) or TILA-TACE (n=10). Again, most of the\u00a0selected clinicopathologic characteristics were well matched between two treatment groups (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). After completion of the first treatment, the VTR in the TILA-TACE group was 5.5-fold lower than that in the cTACE group (4.6% [95% CI: 1.8%\u201311.4%] vs. 25.4% [95% CI: 10.1%\u201364.0%]; p=0.008)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). We also evaluated whether the treatment effect was confounded by aforementioned clinical parameters in the RCT. Among them, only viable tumor volume before treatment was significantly associated with VTR. Adjustment for tumor volume before treatment slightly changed the results, with the VTR in the TILA-TACE of 4.1% (2.0%\u20138.4%) vs. 28.1% (13.9%\u201356.8%) in the cTACE (p=0.0009). The relative therapeutic improvement by bicarbonate in the RCT was 80.1%, similar to that observed in the non-randomized cohort, 81.1%."

The most striking point is that the numbers reflecting the therapeutic improvements by TILA-TACE from the 2 studies were nearly identical (81.1% and 80.1%).

The current study demonstrated that TILA-TACE achieved a remarkable improvement of local tumor control and suggested an early sign of improved survival for patients with large HCCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). It is noted that, during follow up, 16 patients in the TILA-TACE arm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), eventually exhibited progressive disease, including 11 patients with new foci in the liver, 1 with new liver foci and lung metastasis, and 3 with lung metastasis, and 1 with bone metastasis, all of which may account for the death (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>).

Although the small sample size allowed us to evaluate the local tumor control, we did not expect that such small sample size would yield statistically significant data for cumulative survival. Evaluation of survival is a matter much more complicated than evaluation of local control. There are many more factors affecting the survival of patients than those affecting the local tumor control, e.g., tumor characteristics, liver function reserve, tumor staging, disease complications, vascular invasion, metastasis, etc., all of which must be well controlled. While we acknowledged these limitations of the present small RCT, the preliminary survival data allowed us to rationally calculate the sample size for a subsequent large RCT for evaluating the survival difference between cTACE and TILA-TACE. We are planning a large-scale RCT to further confirm the therapeutic advantage of TILA-TACE with respect to overall and progression-free survival of patients with large HCCs."

Specifically, the clinical responses with bicarbonate were remarkable with early signs of improved survival for patients with large HCCs. The authors speculated that reducing or \"targeting\" intra-tumoral lactic acidosis may improve the clinical outcome and reported an objective response rate of 100% in the therapy group vs. 44% in the control group. The authors conclude that bicarbonate local infusion markedly enhances the anticancer activity of TACE. If validated, this approach could be a significant improvement over current TACE and support the notion that cancer metabolism, and in this case \u2013 acidity, could be manipulated in the clinic. While the data are of significant interest, there are some major concerns that must be addressed."

As the weakly basic doxorubicin is more toxic in basic pH than in acidic pH condition, intratumoral alkalization by bicarbonate would potentiate the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. This is a critical point that should be clarified. Therefore, we initiated another small randomized controlled study (Title: Randomized controlled study of bicarbonate-enhanced transarterial chemoembolization and transarterial embolization in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma; registration number ChiCTR-IPR-15006025 in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry), in which, patients were randomly assigned to TILA-TACE or TILA-TAE (transarterial embolization, the same as TILA-TACE, except no chemotherapeutic agents). So far, 36 patients have been treated, and the objective tumor response rates between TILA-TACE and TILA-TAE group were virtually the same. The study is ongoing, but the results achieved so far strongly suggest that bicarbonate is the major agent that results in massive death of HCC, because chemotherapeutic agents (with or without) did not make a significant difference (100% objective response rate (ORR) of the targeted tumors in the TILA-TACE arm versus 93% ORR of the targeted tumors in the TILA-TAE arm)."

Many previous studies have confirmed that better local control was an independent prognostic indicator for patient survival (Kim et al., 2015; Shim et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Riaz et al., 2011; Gillmore et al., 2011; Riaz et al., 2010), and Kim et al. (2015) and Shim et al (2012) further demonstrated that there was a clear prognostic difference between CR, PR, SD, and PD and that PR patients showed a significantly poorer survival than CR patients. Moreover, in the follow up, 16 patients eventually exhibited progressive disease, including 11 patients with new foci in the liver, 1 with new liver foci and lung metastasis, and 3 with lung metastasis, and 1 with bone metastasis, all of which accounted for the death in the experimental arm (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). These observations also suggest that fast CR and timely control of recurrent tumors in the liver would likely improve the survival of patients, especially those with large tumor burden and low liver reserve. We also mentioned it in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (third paragraph)."

Among them, only viable tumor volume before treatment was significantly associated with VTR. We also found a similar association for macrovascular invasion, being of statistically borderline significance. Therefore, we adjusted for these two covariates and estimated multivariable-adjusted VTR using the general linear model. We found that adjustment for these potential confounding factors did not materially alter the results, suggesting that the finding of remarkable improvement in tumor responses in the TILA-TACE vs. cTACE was independent of patients\u2019 clinicopathological characteristics."

PP analyses may provide a better sense of the actual biological effect of treatment but are like to introduce biases to the study because of abolishment of randomization. We acknowledged these limitations of the present small RCT in the revised manuscript. We are planning a large-scale RCT to further examine both targeted/local tumor responses, overall and progression-free survival with bicarbonate TACE in patients with large HCCs."
