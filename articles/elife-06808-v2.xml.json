Mechanistic understanding of branching is largely limited to flowering plants such as <i>Arabidopsis</i>, which have a recent evolutionary origin. We show that in gametophytic shoots of <i>Physcomitrella</i>, lateral branches arise by re-specification of epidermal cells into branch initials. A simple model co-ordinating the activity of leafy shoot tips can account for branching patterns, and three known and ancient hormonal regulators of sporophytic branching interact to generate the branching pattern- auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone. The mode of auxin transport required in branch patterning is a key divergence point from known sporophytic pathways. Although PIN-mediated basipetal auxin transport regulates branching patterns in flowering plants, this is not so in <i>Physcomitrella</i>, where bi-directional transport is required to generate realistic branching patterns. Experiments with callose synthesis inhibitors suggest plasmodesmal connectivity as a potential mechanism for transport."

Mechanistic understanding of branching is largely limited to flowering plants such as <i>Arabidopsis</i>, which have a recent evolutionary origin. We show that in gametophytic shoots of <i>Physcomitrella</i>, lateral branches arise by re-specification of epidermal cells into branch initials. A simple model co-ordinating the activity of leafy shoot tips can account for branching patterns, and three known and ancient hormonal regulators of sporophytic branching interact to generate the branching pattern- auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone. The mode of auxin transport required in branch patterning is a key divergence point from known sporophytic pathways. Although PIN-mediated basipetal auxin transport regulates branching patterns in flowering plants, this is not so in <i>Physcomitrella</i>, where bi-directional transport is required to generate realistic branching patterns. Experiments with callose synthesis inhibitors suggest plasmodesmal connectivity as a potential mechanism for transport."

The experiments also showed that strigolactone inhibits shoot branching, but its role is restricted to the base of the shoots. The model predicts that, unlike in flowering plants, auxin must flow in both directions in moss shoots to produce the observed patterns of shoot branching. Also, the experiments suggest that the PIN proteins and another group of proteins that control the movement of auxin do not regulate shoot branching in moss. Instead, it appears that auxin may move through microscopic channels that link one moss cell to the next."

The earliest vascular plants branched by bifurcation, involving the even partitioning of the growing tip into two new shoot tips (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sussex and Kerk, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Harrison et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Langdale and Harrison, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Harrison and Langdale, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ligrone et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Edwards et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tomescu et al., 2014</a>). Subsequent diversification within the seed plants was underpinned by the evolution of lateral (axillary) branching (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sussex and Kerk, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Langdale and Harrison, 2008</a>), in which buds initiate in leaf axils but may then become dormant until receiving environmental or internal cues to promote their activation and growth. Lateral branching thus permits finely tuned regulation of plant architecture and space filling in response to the environment (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bergamini and Peintinger, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Domagalska and Leyser, 2011</a>). Whilst branching by bifurcation is prevalent in non-seed vascular plant sporophytes and many bryophyte gametophytes, a capacity for lateral branching evolved by convergence in mosses and primed their diversification (<a href=\"#bib36\">Farge-England, 1996</a>)."

Classical decapitation experiments showed that the main shoot apex exerts an inhibitory effect over subsequent branch outgrowth, a phenomenon known as apical dominance. Replacing decapitated apices with lanolin impregnated with phytohormones showed that auxin can mediate this inhibition, and that its action can be antagonized by cytokinin application to buds (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thimann and Skoog, 1933</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wickson and Thimann, 1958</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cline, 1991</a>).

Auxin is synthesized in young expanding leaves and is transported basipetally by several transporters including PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) polar auxin efflux carriers to generate the polar auxin transport stream in the stem (<a href=\"#bib26\">G\u00e4lweiler et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ljung et al., 2001</a>). The suppressive action of auxin on lateral branch outgrowth is mediated indirectly (<a href=\"#bib40\">Morris, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Booker et al., 2003</a>), leading to the hypothesis that a second messenger (for example cytokinin) could act as an intermediary between auxin and bud activation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Morris, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Booker et al., 2003</a>). However, a dominant bud need not be apical, and more recent work suggests that buds compete to export auxin into the main auxin transport stream and that such competition is enhanced by a suppressive action of strigolactones on PIN1-mediated auxin transport (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crawford et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Prusinkiewicz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shinohara et al., 2013</a>).

We found rhizoids initiating in all leaf axils beyond a certain distance from the main gametophore apex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>) but branches were present in only a subset of axils (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013P</a>). In contrast to reports from other species that have identified stereotypical and taxon-specific branch initiation patterns (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berthier et al., 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Berthier, 1970</a>), we found no regular spacing in the pattern of initiation of <i>Physcomitrella</i> branches. We were unable to detect any evidence of dormancy, suggesting that branch initiation and outgrowth are not distinct developmental processes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>). At the earliest stage of branch initiation that we were able to detect, branches were manifest as a single apical cell surrounded by leaf initials and adjacent to rhizoids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013H</a>), appearing to differentiate from the epidermis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013H</a>). At later stages of development, more rhizoids developed at the base of each branch and newly formed leaves were distinguishable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I\u2013L</a>). Well developed lateral branches were morphologically similar to the main gametophore axis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M</a>), and transverse sections cut at the base of lateral branches showed that each branch persisted as a superficial projection; there was no continuity between the conducting tissue of the lateral branches and the conducting tissue of the main stem (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1N\u2013P</a>). We reasoned that the largest branches would have initiated first and evaluated the sequence of branch initiation by dissecting branches from 6 week old gametophores, and ranking their size relative to their position (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Q</a>). These morphological data suggest that in <i>Physcomitrella</i> branches initiate de novo from the epidermis of the gametophore axis and that initiation is usually, but not invariably, acropetal."

The position of lateral branches was recorded (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), showing an uneven distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The formation of a minimum of 18 leaves was required prior to branch initiation, and an apical portion devoid of branches was maintained at a similar length throughout development. We termed the barren apical portion of the gametophore the apical inhibition zone (AIZ), and the portion of the gametophore in which branches initiated was termed the branching zone (BZ). Reasoning that each of these aspects of the branch distribution might be under regulatory control, we sought to determine how the branch initiation pattern deviated from a random distribution. We simulated a dataset of 60 gametophores in which branching occurs stochastically with a probability of 5% to obtain a similar number of branches to WT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We defined a gametophore as a 1D series of metamers where each metamer consists of a section of the main gametophore axis and a leaf, and growth proceeds at a fixed rate adding new metamers as the simulation progresses. Although it was immediately apparent that the simulated dataset lacked apical inhibition, potential differences in branch spacing in the branching zone between WT and simulated datasets were not obvious. We therefore calculated and compared the mean minimum distance between branches in the branching zone of WT (4.48 \u00b1 1.48) and simulated stochastically branching shoots (3.62 \u00b1 0.41). In the WT dataset, branches were more evenly dispersed than expected at random (p-value &lt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), supporting the notion that the distribution of branches within the BZ is regulated. Even if an apical inhibition zone is introduced into a random model of branching, for example by assuming a branching competency that requires a minimum metamer age, it cannot produce a realistic branching pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

A phenomenon that was not observed in real plants (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

We first sought to identify potential contributions of the main gametophore apex and auxin to the branching pattern by performing surgical experiments in which thirty gametophores were teased out of several colonies and decapitated by removal of the top six metamers (the top third of the apical inhibition zone). The excised apices were replaced with lanolin or lanolin impregnated with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Thirty further gametophores were isolated and left intact as a control, and all sets were left to grow for a week. Whilst control gametophores continued to grow as normal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), the gametophores which had their apices replaced by lanolin discontinued growth of the main axis and initiated branches in the portion of the stem originally comprising the apical inhibition zone beneath the cut site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E</a>). In contrast, the gametophores that had their apices replaced by IAA impregnated lanolin had impaired branch initiation and development (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Whilst a total of around 70 branches initiated from lanolin treated control gametophores, around 50 branches initiated from IAA treated gametophores, and of these less than 10 showed normal development. The remainder were shorter than normal and were unable to initiate leaves (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), a defect that we have previously observed in the main apex in gametophores treated with high concentrations of auxin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett et al., 2014b</a>).

However, the <i>GH3::GUS</i> reporter reflects downstream transcriptional outputs of auxin signalling, and may not accurately reflect the auxin distribution (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brunoud et al., 2012</a>). We therefore quantified IAA levels along the gametophore axis by sampling the top six metamers, the apical inhibition zone minus the tip and the branching zone with the branches removed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Despite some variability between replicates, we found that mean IAA levels were highest in the tip. We also undertook decapitation experiments in the <i>GH3::GUS</i> reporter line and found that the signal intensity dropped substantially in decapitated plants, consistent with the notion that the apex can affect auxin levels elsewhere in the gametophore. In combination, data shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> support assumption one of our model by (i) showing that the main apex can regulate the branching pattern, (ii) providing evidence that the main apex is an auxin source, and (iii) showing that apically applied auxin can suppress branching."

We therefore hypothesized that the effects of altering global levels of auxin synthesis could capture aspects of variance in both the primary and lateral gametophore tips (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To test this hypothesis, we grew <i>Physcomitrella</i> mutants or transgenics in which auxin synthesis is diminished or increased (<a href=\"#bib23\">Eklund et al., 2010</a>), and quantified their branching patterns with respect to model predictions and WT controls. A global decrease in auxin levels was simulated by reducing the values of <i>H</i><sub><i>apex</i></sub> and <i>H</i>, and the predicted outcome was a reduction of the apical inhibition zone size, accompanied by an increase in branch density within the branching zone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The branching phenotype of <i>Ppshi2-1</i>, an auxin-deficient mutant in which auxin synthesis at the gametophore apex is reduced (<a href=\"#bib23\">Eklund et al., 2010</a>), matched this predicted outcome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E,G,I,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). Conversely, a global increase in auxin levels was simulated by increasing the values of <i>H</i><sub><i>apex</i></sub> and <i>H</i>, generating the predictions that the apical inhibition zone size should increase and the branch density should decrease (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The branching pattern of <i>PpSHI ox-5</i>, a transgenic line with elevated auxin levels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Eklund et al., 2010</a>), again matched the model output (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F,H,I,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). Thus, by generating a decreased inhibition zone with more branches in the branching zone or an increased inhibition zone with fewer branches in the branching zone respectively, the effects of depleting or elevating <i>SHI</i>-mediated auxin biosynthesis captures predicted effects of changing the target auxin concentrations <i>H</i><sub><i>apex</i></sub> and <i>H</i> in the model."

                                "text": "A second assumption of our regulatory model is that the sensitivity to auxin (parameter <i>T</i>) modulates the branching pattern. In bud treatment experiments in flowering plants and moss, cytokinin antagonizes the suppressive effects of auxin in promoting branching (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thimann and Skoog, 1933</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wickson and Thimann, 1958</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">von Maltzahn, 1959</a>), and we postulated that cytokinin could modulate auxin sensitivity with levels approximating to values of <i>T</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, decreasing the values of <i>T</i> in our model should have the converse effect to an increase in parameter values of <i>H</i>, and this effect should be observed in moss shoots by global reduction of cytokinin levels. To test this hypothesis, we grew <i>Physcomitrella</i> transgenics in which cytokinin degradation is increased, thereby decreasing cytokinin levels (<a href=\"#bib58\">von Schwartzenberg et al., 2007</a>), and quantified their branching patterns (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The predicted outcome of the model was an increase of the apical inhibition zone size and a reduction in branch number (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The branching pattern of a transgenic line that constitutively expresses the <i>Arabidopsis</i> cytokinin degradation gene, <i>CYTOKININ OXIDASE-2</i> (<i>CKX2oe</i>) (<a href=\"#bib58\">von Schwartzenberg et al., 2007</a>), was quantified and found to be similar to the model output in having fewer branches and a larger apical inhibition zone (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E,G,I,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). Conversely, increasing the values of <i>T</i> in the model should have similar effects to a global increase in cytokinin levels. To test this hypothesis, we generated <i>Physcomitrella ISOPENTENYL TRANSFERASE-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib58\">von Schwartzenberg et al., 2007</a>) transgenics (<i>IPT1oe</i>) in which cytokinin levels are upregulated (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and quantified their branching patterns. The predicted outcome of the model was a reduction of the apical inhibition zone size and an increase in the branch number (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>), and the branching pattern in the <i>IPT1oe</i> line was similar (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,F,H,I,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, cytokinin application to gametophores was sufficient to promote meristematic cell formation and proliferation along the gametophore axis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K\u2013N</a>). Thus cytokinin is necessary for and promotes branching and lateral meristem activity."

Realistic branching patterns were only generated when there was relatively even basipetal and acropetal transport within simulated gametophore axes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), a result that is consistent with the absence of detectable bulk basipetal transport in <i>Physcomitrella</i> gametophores (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fujita et al., 2008</a>). The molecular functions of canonical PIN proteins are conserved between flowering plants and mosses (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Viaene et al., 2014</a>), and <i>Physcomitrella</i> PINs have been demonstrated to localise both proximally and distally within leaf cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Viaene et al., 2014</a>). PINs therefore provide one potential mechanism to account for bi-directional auxin transport in the regulation of branching. We previously engineered <i>Physcomitrella pin</i> mutants in a <i>GH3::GUS</i> background (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett et al., 2014b</a>), and found that whilst branching patterns in the <i>GH3::GUS</i> line were similar to WT controls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), <i>pin</i> mutants had mildly disrupted branching patterns (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013H</a>). The apical inhibition zone was shorter in <i>pina pinb</i> mutants than in <i>GH3::GUS</i> controls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>). Branch number was slightly increased in <i>pinb</i> and <i>pina pinb</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J\u2013L</a>) and the mean minimum distance between branches was reduced in <i>pina</i>, <i>pinb</i> and <i>pina pinb</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8M</a>). To rule out the possibility that residual PIN-mediated auxin transport could be responsible for the mild effects of <i>pin</i> mutants on branching patterns, mutants were grown on medium supplemented with 5 \u03bcM NPA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8N\u2013W</a>). In both <i>GH3::GUS</i> and <i>pina pinb</i> lines, branching patterns were found to be similar in mock and NPA-treated plants. Thus PIN-mediated auxin transport is not a major contributor to branching patterns."

Symplastic permeability is under active control via callose deposition such that increased deposition blocks plasmodesmatal connections, and decreased deposition opens them up to allow greater permeability and higher rates of diffusion (<a href=\"#bib30\">Han et al., 2014</a>). As the apolar auxin transport required to generate realistic branching patterns in our model is equivalent in principle to diffusion, we hypothesized that a callose-dependent mechanism could regulate branching. To test this hypothesis, we grew <i>Physcomitrella</i> on a callose biosynthesis inhibitor, 2-deoxy-glucose (DDG), and found that its application did not cause general defects at the concentrations used. We therefore compared the branching patterns to model predictions arising from a simulated increase in the rate of auxin movement (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Simulations predicted that stepwise increases in the rate of movement should progressively reduce branching (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">Videos 11, 12, 13</a>), and in DDG treated plants branching was similarly reduced (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013M</a>).

We noted from published literature (<a href=\"#bib46\">Proust et al., 2011</a>) that the strigolactone biosynthesis gene <i>ppccd8</i> is expressed at the base of gametophores. <i>ppccd8</i> mutants are strigolactone deficient and although no branching defects were previously detected in mutant gametophores (<a href=\"#bib46\">Proust et al., 2011</a>), we reasoned that strigolactones could be the repressive signal. We therefore quantified the branching patterns in <i>ppccd8</i> mutant gametophores relative to WT (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). We found strongly increased branch activation at the base of gametophores (number of branching gametophores: WT, 4/60; <i>ppccd8</i> mutant, 29/60) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). To confirm that the <i>ppccd8</i> mutant phenotype was caused by a deficiency in strigolactone production, we quantified the branching pattern in <i>ppccd8</i> mutants grown on medium supplemented with 1 \u03bcM GR24, a synthetic strigolactone analogue, and found that GR24 was able to suppress basal branch formation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). To evaluate whether strigolactone can act as a global branch suppressor, we analysed the branching pattern in <i>Physcomitrella</i> mutants that over express the pea strigolactone synthesis gene, <i>RMS1</i> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Proust et al., 2011</a>). We found that branching was very strongly suppressed in this transgenic line (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We used gametophores with fewer than 20 leaves for this experiment because comparison of model predictions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>) to WT data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) showed that we should most clearly detect a difference at this stage of development, and <i>ppccd8</i> mutants make few gametophores. Our inferences were supported in a similar but scaled down experiment using fully grown gametophores (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus basal expression of a strigolactone biosynthetic gene can account for the predicted requirement of our model for a local basal inhibitor of branching."

We have shown that these three ancient hormonal cues were recruited independently to regulate lateral branching in gametophores of the moss <i>Physcomitrella</i>. In combination our model and experimental data lead us to a notion of branching whereby the ratio <i>c</i>/<i>T</i> determines the fate of epidermal cells in the gametophore axis. If the ratio drops below a threshold level, an epidermal cell can be respecified as a lateral apical cell thereby triggering branch initiation. Such a drop usually occurs in leaf axils independently of the leaf initiation process at the meristem (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harrison et al., 2009</a>) as a result of competing hormonal cues dispersed across the gametophore. However, cells elsewhere in the metamer are also competent to form branch initials, and do so if the <i>c</i>/<i>T</i> ratio is perturbed, for instance by changing auxin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 6</a>), strigolactone (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) or cytokinin levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Although this process has some similarities to the branch initiation process in <i>Arabidopsis</i> in which a drop in auxin levels in the axils of initiating leaves coupled with a rise in cytokinin levels primes the initiation of the axillary meristem (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wang et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2014b</a>), there are many differences in the regulation of lateral branching between flowering plant sporophytes and <i>Physcomitrella</i> gametophytes."

Our model for branching in <i>Physcomitrella</i> assumes that the main gametophore apex acts as the source of a cue that can move into the gametophore axis to suppress branching. Decapitation experiments show that the main gametophore apex inhibits branching and that this inhibitory effect can be maintained if the apex is substituted by a source of auxin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We detect higher levels of auxin in the apex than elsewhere in the gametophore, and removal of the apex diminishes levels of expression of an auxin responsive reporter in the gametophore axis, thereby implicating auxin as an apical cue and indicating a requirement for auxin transport away from the apex in the regulation of branching patterns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Although these results are qualitatively similar to the outcome of such experiments in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thimann and Skoog, 1933</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wickson and Thimann, 1958</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cline, 1991</a>), no bulk basipetal auxin transport has been detected in <i>Physcomitrella</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fujita et al., 2008</a>). Our model predicts a requirement for bi-directional, or diffusion-like transport to generate realistic patterns (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), and suggests that not only the direction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), but also the rate of transport has a significant impact on branch patterning (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Our experiments with <i>pin</i> mutants and pharmacological inhibitors show that membrane-targeted auxin transporters belonging to PIN and ABCB/PGP families are not significant contributors to branch patterning (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Patterning is sensitive to the application of the callose synthesis inhibitor DDG, and incremental increases in the concentration of applied DDG have similar effects on branch patterning as incremental increases in the rates of transport implemented in our model (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). These data suggest that auxin may move with diffusive properties via callose-gated plasmodesmatal connections between cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Han et al., 2014</a>)."

Although the role of cytokinin in gametophore induction is well characterized in <i>Physcomitrella</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashton et al., 1979</a>), and cytokinin has previously been shown to antagonize auxin in branch formation (<a href=\"#bib57\">von Maltzahn, 1959</a>), little is known about where and how cytokinin acts later in gametophore development. Our results are consistent with a homogenous effect of cytokinin within the gametophore axis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), and further analysis of cytokinin distributions, for instance with a modified TCS reporter (<a href=\"#bib41\">M\u00fcller and Sheen, 2008</a>), may be informative. Upregulation of cytokinin levels by overexpressing <i>IPT1</i>, and exogenous cytokinin applications show that cytokinin is sufficient to promote lateral meristem formation and therefore indicate that cytokinin directly promotes branching (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Whereas strigolactone is thought to suppress branch outgrowth in <i>Arabidopsis</i> by dampening PIN mediated polar auxin transport, the mode of action of strigolactone in <i>Physcomitrella</i> is unclear. Notably, key strigolactone signalling components required for the inhibition of sporophyte branching in higher plants are not present in mosses (<a href=\"#bib19\">Delaux et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">de Saint Germain et al., 2013</a>). For instance, components such as D14 (involved in strigolactone perception) and D53 are absent in <i>Physcomitrella</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Challis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Delaux et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). Similarly the <i>Physcomitrella</i> homologue of the F-Box protein MAX2 may not be involved in strigolactone signalling, despite its central role in many strigolactone responses in flowering plants (<a href=\"#bib17\">de Saint Germain et al., 2013</a>). The modulation of branching by <i>PpCCD8</i> and <i>RMS1</i> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was unexpected as previously published work identified roles for <i>PpCCD8</i> in protonemal but not gametophore branching patterns (<a href=\"#bib46\">Proust et al., 2011</a>). The basal expression domain of <i>PpCCD8</i> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Proust et al., 2011</a>) is consistent with a local site of hormone action, but the mechanism underlying the <i>ppccd8</i> and <i>RMS1oe</i> mutant phenotypes remains to be seen. Although there is a substantial body of evidence that strigolactone-like signals are active across the plant kingdom, the ancestral function of strigolactone and/or these strigolactone-like signals is thought to be in rhizoid elongation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Delaux et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">de Saint Germain et al., 2013</a>). The absence of distinct branch initiation and outgrowth processes in <i>Physcomitrella</i> implicates strigolactone in branch initiation, and the relative unimportance of PIN-mediated auxin transport in the regulation of <i>Physcomitrella</i> branching patterns suggests that strigolactone is unlikely to act via PIN-mediated auxin transport."

Although plant phylogenies show that gametophytic branching forms have several independent evolutionary origins, the innovation of sporophytic branching maps once onto the plant tree of life (<a href=\"#bib37\">Langdale and Harrison, 2008</a>) and occurred in pre-vascular plants such as <i>Partitatheca</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Edwards et al., 2014</a>). Exogenous hormone treatments in <i>Selaginella</i> have shown that the antagonistic relationship between auxin and cytokinin in the regulation of branching is conserved within the vascular plants (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sanders and Langdale, 2013</a>). Furthermore, auxin transport assays and pharmacological treatments used in combination with decapitation in <i>Selaginella</i> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Williams, 1937</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wochok and Sussex, 1973</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">1975</a>) have shown that auxin transport-mediated apical dominance is a homology of vascular plant sporophytes. Disruption of PIN-mediated polar auxin transport in moss sporophytes can induce a branching form that is intermediate between living bryophytes and vascular plants (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fujita et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett et al., 2014b</a>), and resembles the earliest branching forms in the sporophytic fossil record (<a href=\"#bib22\">Edwards et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that auxin transport-regulated branching may be a homology of the sporophyte generation. Although the regulation of lateral branching by three key regulatory hormone pathways in moss gametophytes indicates deep homology (<a href=\"#bib49\">Scotland, 2010</a>), the mode and basis of auxin transport are a key divergence point in branch patterning mechanisms between land plant sporophytes and gametophytes."

In the model, a strigolactone induced reduction of the threshold is required in the basal \u201c5 or so\u201d cells, yet there are often branches formed in these regions in real plants (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C and 5A</a>)."

Data on the <i>pin</i> mutants seems not fully conclusive but consistent with the PINs being apolar transporters, however the authors claim transporters play a minor role. If neither PINs nor the ABCBs are responsible for this transport, how does the auxin get from cell to cell? It cannot really diffuse across the membrane, yet the model suggests a diffusive mechanism, such as apolar transport. This makes the whole argument a bit confusing and weak.

They propose a model based on the interaction of auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone. The model consists of a growing apex that is a source of auxin, with the lateral branches also acting as auxin sources. Auxin diffuses away from the sources, and is degraded creating gradients. Cells that are below a threshold of auxin concentration initiate lateral branches. The concentration at sources is assigned with some random variation, as is the threshold for initiation in each cell. Cytokinin is added to the basic model by changing the threshold concentration of auxin below which outgrowth will occur, and strigolcatone is added by having an inhibitory effect at the base."

Does this not suggest a process more active than a simple diffusion/threshold model, which is known not to be robust? The model needs some sort of local activation and long range inhibition, like a reaction-diffusion diffusion system, or like the model in Prusinkiewicz 2009, PNAS. It seems a bit difficult to compare distances in such a model with WT, when simple features of the distribution are different."
