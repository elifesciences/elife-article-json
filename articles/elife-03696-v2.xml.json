However, their developmental relationships remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that different MSC populations in the developing marrow of long bones have distinct functions. Proliferative mesoderm-derived nestin<sup>\u2212</sup> MSCs participate in fetal skeletogenesis and lose MSC activity soon after birth. In contrast, quiescent neural crest-derived nestin<sup>+</sup> cells preserve MSC activity, but do not generate fetal chondrocytes. Instead, they differentiate into HSC niche-forming MSCs, helping to establish the HSC niche by secreting Cxcl12. Perineural migration of these cells to the bone marrow requires the ErbB3 receptor. The neonatal Nestin-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>\u2212</sup> cell population also contains Schwann cell precursors, but does not comprise mature Schwann cells. Thus, in the developing bone marrow HSC niche-forming MSCs share a common origin with sympathetic peripheral neurons and glial cells, and ontogenically distinct MSCs have non-overlapping functions in endochondrogenesis and HSC niche formation."

However, their developmental relationships remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that different MSC populations in the developing marrow of long bones have distinct functions. Proliferative mesoderm-derived nestin<sup>\u2212</sup> MSCs participate in fetal skeletogenesis and lose MSC activity soon after birth. In contrast, quiescent neural crest-derived nestin<sup>+</sup> cells preserve MSC activity, but do not generate fetal chondrocytes. Instead, they differentiate into HSC niche-forming MSCs, helping to establish the HSC niche by secreting Cxcl12. Perineural migration of these cells to the bone marrow requires the ErbB3 receptor. The neonatal Nestin-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>\u2212</sup> cell population also contains Schwann cell precursors, but does not comprise mature Schwann cells. Thus, in the developing bone marrow HSC niche-forming MSCs share a common origin with sympathetic peripheral neurons and glial cells, and ontogenically distinct MSCs have non-overlapping functions in endochondrogenesis and HSC niche formation."

The most important source of blood stem cells is the bone marrow, which produces and stores cells that are capable of developing into blood and immune system cells.

It turns out that not all stromal stem cells in the developing bone marrow are alike. In fact, one pool of stromal stem cells forms the skeleton and loses stem cell activity in the process. In contrast, a different population of stromal stem cells develops from the same group of embryonic cells that gives rise to the cells of the nervous system. The stromal stem cells in this second group function as a niche to recruit and store the incoming blood stem cells and retain their stem cell activity throughout life."

The different mesenchymal cell types might either arise from a variety of resident progenitors or might ultimately be derived from a single population of rare MSCs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Caplan, 1991</a>). In adult mammals, a multiple origin of skeletal MSCs is suggested by the distinct germ layer derivation of different bone structures, with craniofacial bones generated by the neuroectoderm, whereas the axial and appendicular bones are respectively derived from paraxial and lateral mesoderm. Mesoderm generates chondrocytes, which are progressively replaced by osteoblasts through the process of endochondral ossification (<a href=\"#bib57\">Olsen et al., 2000</a>). MSCs share cell-surface markers and localization with pericytes, suggesting that some pericytes might be MSCs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crisan et al., 2008</a>). However, it remains unclear whether the bone marrow hosts ontogenically distinct MSCs in the same bones and whether they are endowed with specific functions."

Thus, whereas mesoderm-derived MSCs are mostly involved in endochondral ossification, neural crest-derived cells have a specialized function in establishing the HSC niche in the developing marrow of the same bones. These results provide compelling evidence for functional segregation of MSCs derived from different germ layers. The data also show that three HSC niche components\u2014peripheral sympathetic neurons, Schwann cells, and MSCs\u2014share a common origin."

This finding prompted us to characterize Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells during marrow development in limb bones. GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were already present in E16.5 bone marrow, associated preferentially with blood vessels infiltrating the cartilage scaffold (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). At E18.5 Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were frequently associated with arterioles and sprouting endothelial cells within the osteochondral junction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). Fetal bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were heterogeneous, composed of a majority of BMSCs but also including a small subset of CD31<sup>+</sup> putative endothelial cells that increased during the postnatal period (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Compared with Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs, the Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cell population was enriched in endogenous <i>Nestin</i> mRNA expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Arterioles were associated with an intense fluorescence microscopy signal, due to the presence of several concentric GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, including an outer layer that expressed smooth muscle actin and an inner layer of endothelial cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). Fetal bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were distinct from S100-expressing chondrocytes and osteoblastic cells genetically labeled with the 2.3-kilobase proximal fragment of the \u03b11(I)-collagen promoter (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dacquin et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H\u2013J</a>). Contrasting the marked proliferation of Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs in perinatal life, Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells remained mostly quiescent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). As a result, whereas Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs steadily expanded, Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> BMSC number did not change significantly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>). Fetal bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells thus include a small subset (&lt;10%) of endothelial cells and a large population of non-endothelial stromal cells (&gt;90%).

We therefore measured mesenchymal progenitor activity in purified bone-marrow stromal subsets using the fibroblastic colony-forming unit (CFU-F) assay (<a href=\"#bib24\">Friedenstein et al., 1970</a>) and the multipotent self-renewing sphere-forming assay (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). BMSCs were isolated according to Nes-GFP expression (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). CFU-F efficiency was nearly three times higher in Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> cells than in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells at E17.5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Conversely, non-adherent sphere formation was markedly enriched in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, whereas most spheres derived from GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> cells rapidly attached to plastic and spontaneously differentiated into adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013G</a>), suggesting that Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs are in a more committed state. Spheres formed by Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells contained mesenchyme-like spindle-shaped GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). At E18.5 and during the first postnatal week, CFU-F frequency was 6-fold higher in the GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> stromal population than in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). However, at later postnatal stages, CFU-F activity was progressively restricted to Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells due to a sharp drop in activity in GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> BMSCs (&gt;100-fold reduction between E18.5 and P14, compared with a 0.5-fold reduction in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells). At P7, CFU-Fs derived from Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> cells contained mostly preosteoblasts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013K</a>). The expression of genes associated with chondrocyte development was higher in Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> than in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> BMSCs at E18.5; in contrast, the expression of master regulators of chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and adipogenesis was progressively enriched in postnatal Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> BMSCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>), consistent with the increasing MSC enrichment in this population. Together, these results suggest that most fetal BMSCs do not express nestin and quickly differentiate towards committed skeletal precursors, losing most MSC activity by the second week after birth. In contrast, nestin<sup>+</sup> cells conserve MSC activity throughout life."

Although cells traced to neural crest origin have been reported in adult murine bone marrow (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nagoshi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Morikawa et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Glejzer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Komada et al., 2012</a>), their precise identity, developmental dynamics, and function have remained elusive. Moreover, the neural crest-specific <i>Wnt1-Cre</i> line used in these studies displays ectopic <i>Wnt1</i> activation. To trace neural crest derivatives, we performed genetic fate-mapping studies with a recent <i>Wnt1-Cre2</i> line that does not induce ectopic Wnt1 activity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lewis et al., 2013</a>). Unexpectedly, limb bones from <i>Wnt1-Cre2</i>;<i>R26-Tomato</i> double-transgenic neonates showed some neural crest-derived osteoblasts and osteocytes aligning the most recent layers of bone deposition, as well as similarly distributed chondrocytes in the outermost layers of the femur head (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). As expected, neural crest-traced Schwann cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were also detected in the bone marrow of one-week old mice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

The number of neural crest-traced osteochondral cells increased in the first postnatal week (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). By P28, CFU-F activity was much higher in <i>Wnt1-Cre2</i>-traced cells than in non-neural crest-traced bone marrow stromal cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Unbiased hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) revealed that Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>+</sup> cells were more similar to adult primitive BMSCs and distinct from more differentiated osteoblastic cells (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nakamura et al., 2010</a>). Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>+</sup> Nes-GFP<sup>+/\u2212</sup> cells clustered nearby, consistent with the increasing restriction of Pdgfr\u03b1 to Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in postnatal bone marrow. In addition, Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfr\u03b1 <sup>+</sup> cells clustered far from Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>\u2212</sup> cells, whose genomic profile was closest to that of E12.5 Schwann cell precursors. MSC-like and neural crest stem-cell-like derived clones (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wislet-Gendebien et al., 2012</a>) were markedly different, probably because these were cultured cells.

At the intersection of these differentiation waves, adult bone marrow CD45<sup>\u2212</sup> Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010</a>) converged with bone marrow HSC niche cells identified by the expression of stem cell factor (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ding et al., 2012</a>). These results suggest the existence of two nestin<sup>+</sup> populations with non-overlapping MSC and Schwann cell precursor features. To test this hypothesis functionally, we cultured neonatal Nes-GFP<sup>+/\u2212</sup> Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> BMSCs in differentiation medium, finding that mesenchymal and glial differentiation was segregated in Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>+</sup> and Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>\u2212</sup> cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>).

                                "text": "Under similar culture conditions used to grow neural crest cells, adult mouse bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells can form self-renewing and multipotent mesenchymal spheres with the capacity to transfer hematopoietic activity to ectopic sites during serial transplantations (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010</a>). In addition, human bone marrow-derived mesenspheres secrete factors that can expand human cord blood HSCs through secreted factors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Isern et al., 2013</a>). These findings and the results presented so far together suggest that neural crest-derived MSCs might have a specialized function in establishing the HSC niche in the developing bone marrow. We further studied the role of neural crest-derived cells in this process using a loss-of-function model. Perineural migration of neural crest-derived cells requires the interaction of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase ErbB3 with the ligand neuregulin-1, produced by developing nerves (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jessen and Mirsky, 2005</a>). <i>Erbb3</i>-deficient mice initially show normal development of peripheral nerves but later display impaired perineural migration of neural crest-derived cells and die at perinatal stage (<a href=\"#bib63\">Riethmacher et al., 1997</a>). Hematopoietic progenitors were increased in fetal liver of KO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In contrast, expression of the MSC marker CD90, enriched in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>), was reduced two-fold in <i>Erbb3</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> limb bone marrow, associated with 5-fold drop in the number of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,G</a>). To further dissect the contribution of neural crest to fetal hematopoiesis, we performed a similar analysis in mice conditionally lacking ErbB3 in Schwann-committed cells. To label Schwann cells, we intercrossed <i>R26-Tomato</i> reporter mice intercrossed with a line expressing Cre recombinase under the regulatory elements of desert hedgehog (<i>Dhh</i>) promoter (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jaegle et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). These <i>Dhh-Cre</i> mice were then intercrossed with the ErbB3 conditional KO. Similar to the constitutive KO, <i>Dhh-Cre</i>;<i>Erbb3</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> mice are virtually devoid of Schwann cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sheean et al., 2014</a>); however, unlike the constitutive KO, <i>Dhh-Cre</i>;<i>Erbb3</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> mice had a normal frequency of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Together, these results suggest that neural crest cells not yet committed to the Schwann cell lineage migrate along developing nerves to the bone marrow, giving rise to HSC niche-forming MSCs."

We show that the developing bone marrow in axial and appendicular skeleton harbors different MSC populations with distinct origins and specialized roles. While mesoderm-derived nestin<sup>\u2212</sup> MSCs give rise to bone and cartilage, the neuroectoderm provides an additional source of MSCs, marked by nestin expression, that are endowed with specific HSC niche functions. We therefore conclude that osteochondroprogenitor and stem cell niche functions are separate and non-overlapping during bone marrow ontogenesis. The neural crest thus gives rise to three regulators of adult HSC activity: sympathetic neurons, associated Schwann cells, and nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs."

While the neural crest contributes to the craniofacial skeleton, the trunk neural crest is thought to generate mostly non-ectomesenchymal derivatives, including melanocytes, neurons, and glia of the peripheral nervous system. In the trunk skeleton, mesenchymal cells have thus been considered to be derived mostly from the mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib57\">Olsen et al., 2000</a>), but the neural crest is also a source of pericytes, mural cells, and fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bergwerff et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Etchevers et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Joseph et al., 2004</a>) that can differentiate into mesenchymal lineages in vitro (<a href=\"#bib51\">Morikawa et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Glejzer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">John et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Komada et al., 2012</a>). In addition, mature endothelial cells can generate mesenchymal cells through endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Genetic fate-mapping studies using the neuroepithelial marker <i>Sox1</i> identified a neuroectodermal origin of the earliest trunk MSCs, but other MSCs are recruited from undefined sources at later stages (<a href=\"#bib74\">Takashima et al., 2007</a>).

It therefore remains possible that some Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, which highly express <i>Osterix</i> mRNA (but not the protein, as we show here), also express the <i>Osterix-Cre</i> transgene; however, this might not necessarily reflect a lineage relationship or osteoblastic commitment. Moreover, it is unclear whether this <i>Osterix-Cre</i>-traced population is uniformly mesodermal or neural crest-derived. We did not find Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within cartilage, but some GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were associated with the innermost part of the perichondrium, a region that contains MSCs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Maes et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zaidi and Mendez-Ferrer, 2013</a>).

Neural crest-derived skeletal embryonic precursors might be Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>+</sup> Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs, since we have shown that most neural crest cells traced by <i>Wnt1-Cre2</i> are Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>+</sup> Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, which do not seem to contribute to fetal osteochondral lineages."

Notably, two surface markers used to isolate osteochondrogenic precursors in these studies, CD105 and CD90/Thy1, are particularly enriched in bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. Our genetic studies clearly show that neural crest-derived cells that are not yet committed to the Schwann cell lineage migrate to bone in association with developing nerve fibers and give rise to bone marrow nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs with specialized HSC niche functions. Constitutive deletion of the neuregulin-1 receptor ErbB3<i>,</i> which does not directly affect the peripheral nerves but impairs perineural migration of neural crest-derived cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Riethmacher et al., 1997</a>), reduces BMSC number and impairs developmental HSC migration from liver to bone marrow. In contrast, conditional deletion of <i>ErbB3</i> in committed glial precursors severely reduced Schwann cell numbers (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sheean et al., 2014</a>) but did not affect bone marrow HSCs in our study. HSC maintenance genes are highly enriched and progressively upregulated in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>+</sup> MSCs, coincident with HSC bone marrow colonization (<a href=\"#bib15\">Christensen et al., 2004</a>). Perinatal deletion of nestin<sup>+</sup> cells or blockade of their Cxcl12 production prevented HSC bone marrow seeding. Therefore, we are confident that neural crest-derived nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs are indeed required for developmental HSC migration and formation of the bone marrow HSC niche."

Two populations of adult bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells can be separated by fluorescence intensity by microscopy. Nes-GFP<sup>bright</sup> peri-arteriolar cells, unlike Nes-GFP<sup>dim</sup> peri-sinusoidal cells, were found highly enriched in CFU-F activity and expression of HSC maintenance genes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kunisaki et al., 2013</a>). However, these features have been previously attributed to peri-sinusoidal cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kiel et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sacchetti et al., 2007</a>), which, unlike arteriolar cells, express both Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> and leptin receptor (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ding et al., 2012</a>). Alternatively, an intermediate type of vessel that connects arterioles with sinusoids near the bone surface might be highly enriched in nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs. These vessels, different from arterioles and sinusoids, contain CD31<sup>hi</sup> Endomucin<sup>hi</sup> endothelial cells and have been associated with osteoprogenitor activity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kusumbe et al., 2014</a>). We initially reported that adult bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were CD31<sup>\u2212</sup> after using an intensive enzymatic digestion protocol to isolate the cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010</a>). In the present study, we have used milder conditions that better preserve antigen expression. In these conditions, we detect Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> CD31<sup>+</sup> putative bone marrow endothelial cells progressively increasing in number with age, as reported by others (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ono et al., 2014</a>). We also find that multiple layers of Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> endothelial and perivascular cells likely make the arteriolar GFP signal appear brighter for GFP under the microscope. This raises the possibility that arteriolar Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kunisaki et al., 2013</a>) might not completely coincide with the brightest cells isolated by FACS. However, we also found that <i>Cxcl12</i> is more abundantly produced by Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> BMSCs than by endothelial cells, and that <i>Cxcl12</i> deletion in <i>Nes-CreER</i><sup><i>T2</i></sup> mice impairs developmental HSC migration by preferentially targeting BMSCs."

                        "text": "Different bone marrow cells have been proposed as the main producers of Cxcl12 for HSCs. One report has argued that the only relevant source of Cxcl12 for adult HSC maintenance is nestin<sup>\u2013</sup>leptin receptor<sup>\u2013</sup>mesenchymal progenitors targeted by the <i>Prx1-Cre</i> driver (<a href=\"#bib26\">Greenbaum et al., 2013</a>). This conclusion is based on the stronger HSC depletion when <i>Cxcl12</i> was deleted using the <i>Prx1-Cre</i> line\u2014which targets somatic lateral plate mesoderm and its derivatives, including chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages\u2014compared to deletion in more specific stromal populations. Also, the HSC defect was specifically attributed to CD45<sup>-</sup> Lin<sup>\u2212</sup> Pdgfr\u03b1<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> <i>Prx1-cre</i>-tdtomato<sup>hi</sup> cells which were not enriched in the expression of nestin or leptin receptor but also showed no marked enrichment in the expression of <i>Cxcl12</i>, <i>Kitl</i> or other mesenchymal markers. An alternate model is that endothelial cells are needed for Cxcl12-mediated adult HSC maintenance (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ding et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ding and Morrison, 2013</a>). Nonetheless, the <i>Tek</i>-<i>Cre</i> system used would also target endothelial cells in fetal hematopoietic organs, so some of the effects might have been exported to the bone marrow during development. The study, in essence, proposed that nestin-negative leptin receptor (<i>Lepr</i>)-<i>Cre</i>-traced mesenchymal progenitors are another key source of Cxcl12 for HSC maintenance. These studies, however, analyzed the adult bone marrow, whereas the focus of our study has been the fetal and perinatal period. Differences may also have arisen from distinct experimental settings, Cre drivers (constitutive/inducible), Cre induction regimes and reporters used. It is also likely that constitutive <i>Prx1-Cre</i> and <i>Lepr-Cre</i> lines target multiple mesenchymal derivatives and that combined deletion of <i>Cxcl12</i> in these populations would have a more pronounced effect than deletion in specific cell types; however, the responsible cell populations might not be clear yet. Conversely, the lower excision in <i>Nes-Cre</i> mice and inefficient bone marrow recombination in adult <i>Nes-CreER</i><sup><i>T2</i></sup> mice might not target all MSCs, or might result in compensatory actions by other Cxcl12-producing cells. In the present study, recombination efficiency in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> MSCs was higher when tamoxifen was administered in neonatal <i>Nes-CreER</i><sup><i>T2</i></sup> mice than in adults. It has also been proposed that <i>Nes</i>-G<i>fp</i> and <i>Nes-CreER</i><sup><i>T2</i></sup> lines might target different populations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ding et al., 2012</a>). To directly address this, we generated <i>Nes</i>-G<i>fp</i>;<i>Nes-CreER</i><sup><i>T2</i></sup><i>;R26-Tomato</i> triple transgenic mice that demonstrate consistent labeling using a different induction protocol. Bone marrow endothelial <i>Cxcl12</i> expression levels are significantly lower in this model, and seem unaffected by <i>Nes-CreER</i><sup><i>T2</i></sup>-driven excision, contrasting with the reduction in BMSCs, which was associated with decreased HSPC numbers in perinatal bone marrow. Our results thus clearly show that Cxcl12 produced by nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs is required for developmental HSC migration to bone marrow."

In contrast, a distinct population of neural crest-derived nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs contributes to directed HSC migration through the secretion of the chemokine Cxcl12 to ultimately establish the HSC niche in the neonatal bone marrow. These niche-forming MSCs share a common origin with sympathetic neurons and Schwann cells, an ontogenic relationship that underscores our earlier observations on the sympathetic control of HSC niche function (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arranz et al., 2014</a>).

Confocal, high magnification analysis would be required to substantiate the results in virtually all the figures presented. Moreover, even at low magnification there are clear inconsistencies: for example expression of CD31 is not known to occur in non-endothelial cells and thus a double staining should have been performed. Also, while Osterix appears not to be expressed in lateral plate derived cells (but very few cells are shown), the co-expression with Wnt1 labeled neural crest is partial and doubtful, making the main conclusion of the whole work particularly weak."

Even though recombination is never 100% efficient, one would conclude that the very large majority of Osx expressing cells do not derive from lateral mesoderm.

The Wnt1-Cre/Tomato clearly shows a dim (continuous with background) and a very bright population, both gated together to show that 62% of these are Nes-GFP+. I would have liked to see whether the Nes-GFP+ cells are equally represented in the bright and the dim populations. This is critical because the results are highly dependent on the specific gating. Most importantly, the IF shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> is highly unconvincing and does not support the claim that Nes-GFP+ are derived from Wnt1 expressing cells. The very few Tomato+ cells do not really co-localize with GFP+ cells and the examples shown in D look like at most closely located cells. Finally, the FACS analysis for Sox10-Cre also shows that gating has included both bright cells, clearly separated from the negative peak and the shoulder of this.

The manuscript is filled with information but it is sometimes difficult to understand how it is related to the main question. For example, it is not explained why CD31 immunostaining is performed on nestin gfp tissues; what cell types does it mark? Convention is the endothelial and hematopoietic cells express CD31, not MSC.

They demonstrate that trunk neural crest cells are the developmental source for Nes-GFP+ MSC in the BM, in addition to their known contributions to peripheral sympathetic neurons and Schwann cells. Interestingly, all three of these cells types are important BM niche components. As such they share an ontological relationship that could theoretically extend to other niche components elsewhere in the body.
