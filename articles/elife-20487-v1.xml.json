Using a statistical framework to analyze single-cell transcriptomics data, we infer the gene expression dynamics of early mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell differentiation, uncovering discrete transitions across nine cell states. We validate the predicted transitions across discrete states using flow cytometry. Moreover, using live-cell microscopy, we show that individual cells undergo abrupt transitions from a na\u00efve to primed pluripotent state. Using the inferred discrete cell states to build a probabilistic model for the underlying gene regulatory network, we further predict and experimentally verify that these states have unique response to perturbations, thus defining them functionally. Our study provides a framework to infer the dynamics of differentiation from single cell transcriptomics data and to build predictive models of the gene regulatory networks that drive the sequence of cell fate decisions during development."

Using a statistical framework to analyze single-cell transcriptomics data, we infer the gene expression dynamics of early mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell differentiation, uncovering discrete transitions across nine cell states. We validate the predicted transitions across discrete states using flow cytometry. Moreover, using live-cell microscopy, we show that individual cells undergo abrupt transitions from a na\u00efve to primed pluripotent state. Using the inferred discrete cell states to build a probabilistic model for the underlying gene regulatory network, we further predict and experimentally verify that these states have unique response to perturbations, thus defining them functionally. Our study provides a framework to infer the dynamics of differentiation from single cell transcriptomics data and to build predictive models of the gene regulatory networks that drive the sequence of cell fate decisions during development."

A major challenge in developmental biology is to uncover the dynamics of gene expression and the underlying gene regulatory networks that lead cells to their different fates. Given the complexity of gene regulatory networks, with their large number of components and even larger number of potential interactions between those components, building detailed predictive mathematical models is challenging. The lack of sufficient data requires a large number of assumptions to be made in order to constrain all the parameters in such models (<a href=\"#bib24\">Karr et al., 2012</a>)."

We asked whether we could similarly determine the suitable parameters to quantitatively describe cell state transitions during early mammalian germ layer development and build predictive mathematical models of the underlying regulatory network."

Following implantation, na\u00efve pluripotent ES cells of the inner cell mass downregulate <i>Klf4</i> and upregulate <i>Otx2</i>, <i>Dnmt3a</i>, and <i>Dnmt3b</i>, as they transition into \u2018primed\u2019 pluripotent cells found in the epiblast (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buecker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nichols and Smith, 2009</a>). Over the next few days of differentiation, TGF-beta signaling factors, with the aid of WNT/beta-catenin signaling, promote and inhibit the differentiation of pluripotent cells into mesendodermal (characterized by genes such as <i>Brachyury</i> (<i>T</i>), <i>FoxA2</i>, <i>Mixl1</i> and <i>Gsc</i>) and ectodermal (characterized by <i>Eras</i>, <i>Sez6</i>, <i>Stmn3</i>, and <i>Stmn4</i>) cell fates, respectively (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gadue et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hart et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lindsley et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tada et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Watabe and Miyazono, 2009</a>). Mesendodermal progenitors further differentiate into mesoderm and definitive endoderm progenitors. Mesoderm cells are usually distinguished by the\u00a0expression of <i>Gata4</i> and <i>Eomes</i>, and endoderm cells by <i>Sox17</i> and <i>FoxA2</i>, although in mouse these genes are shared between both lineages, with differences only in their timing and level of expression (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kanai-Azuma et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim and Ong, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lumelsky et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rojas et al., 2005</a>). Along the ectodermal lineage, BMP signaling pushes ectodermal cells toward epidermis, while in the absence of BMP signaling, ectodermal cells acquire a neural fate (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wilson and Hemmati-Brivanlou, 1995</a>). Epidermal cells are characterized by Keratins, whereas neural cells express <i>Sox1</i> and <i>Pax6</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koch and Roop, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pevny et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sansom et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Streit and Stern, 1999</a>). The cells at the physical border between epidermal and neural cells give rise to neural crest cells (expressing <i>Sox10</i>, <i>Msx2</i>, <i>Snai1</i> and <i>Slug</i>) in response to WNT and BMP signaling, which are often described as a fourth germ layer because of the diverse range of tissues to which they give rise (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gans and Northcutt, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Knecht and Bronner-Fraser, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Le Douarin, 1991</a>). Despite the detailed understanding of early embryonic development revealed by decades of work in genetics and developmental biology, a quantitative understanding of how the underlying gene regulatory network leads cells through a series of cell fate decisions has remained elusive."

Intriguingly, requiring the model to have discrete cell states leads to the prediction that each cell state has a\u00a0distinct response to perturbations by signals and changing transcription factor expression levels. We experimentally verify three distinct categories of predictions, each testing whether cells exhibit such state-dependent behavior in response to a different type of perturbation. The experimental results conclude that whether (i) <i>Sox2</i> overexpression represses <i>Oct4</i>, (ii) <i>Snai1</i> overexpression represses <i>Oct4</i>, and (iii) LIF and BMP promote pluripotency or differentiation into neural crest, all depend on cell state. Finally, we discuss the biological implications of our results."

The number of high-probability transition or marker genes (g#) used for clustering is shown below each iteration number. At a threshold of p=0.97 (middle-right), due to the number of genes used for re-clustering becoming ever smaller, the resulting clustering configuration shows several clusters merging or breaking into smaller clusters. (<b>B</b>) At a threshold of p=0.96 (left), the number of genes used for the last iteration of re-clustering (#g) is 416, which still results in a clustering configuration that is largely (&gt;95%) identical to the original configuration.

However, for most of these parameters, direct experimental measurements are not available. In order to overcome this challenge, we exploited recent developments based on renormalization group approaches to determine which parameters are relevant for the observed data (<a href=\"#bib37\">Machta et al., 2013</a>). We adapted the seminal model of artificial neural networks, known as the Hopfield model (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fard et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hopfield, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Maetschke and Ragan, 2014</a>), to construct an effective gene regulatory network between the 29 gene modules. By construction, we required that this mathematical model produces the nine cell states seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. We considered a network that contains direct interactions, in which each module <i>j</i> exerts a drive on module <i>i</i>, which is equal to an interaction strength <math id=\"inf55\"><mrow><msub><mi>J</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math> (positive or negative) multiplied by the concentration of module <i>j</i>. The total drive on module <i>i</i> is the sum of the drives from the different modules. Given our observation of discrete cell states, we further considered that the total drive on module <i>i</i> affects expression in a highly non-linear manner, with high gene expression for drives that exceed a critical drive <math id=\"inf56\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></math>, and low gene expression otherwise (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). For simplicity, we assumed that the expression of every gene module exhibits a non-linear, step-function response, when subjected to the same drive; thereby reducing the number of parameters of the model. Indeed there are numerous genes that manifest sigmoidal-like response in expression, in the presence of internal and external stimuli (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lebrecht et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Segal and Widom, 2009</a>).

Mean positive and negative interactions between the modules are shown in red and green, respectively, and their thickness and transparency are proportional to the absolute magnitude of the mean and the coefficient of variation (c.v.), respectively. The colored circles represent the gene modules expressed uniquely in only one of the cell states (color code matched with <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> for each state).

As cells transition from C<sub>0</sub> to C<sub>1</sub>, expression of [<i>Klf4</i>], [<i>Apex1</i>], [<i>Ets2</i>], [<i>Atf2</i>] modules is downregulated (shown in gray) while [<i>Hes6</i>] and [<i>Otx2</i>] modules are upregulated, leading to changes in the effective interactions between gene modules that are common to both C<sub>0</sub> and C<sub>1</sub> states, such as [<i>Sox2</i>] and [<i>Oct4</i>].

In order to obtain the error bars for this and subsequent predictions, we randomly sampled three subsets of 3333 from the 10,000 models. For each set we computed the mean and standard error of the proportion of models that show downregulation of <i>Oct4</i> in response to <i>Sox2</i> overexpression.

In the C<sub>1</sub> state (solid line), the over expression of [<i>Snai1</i>] has no effect on [<i>Oct4</i>] levels in\u00a0~94.5% of the 10,000 models whereas in the C<sub>2</sub> state (dotted line), the overexpression of [<i>Snai1</i>] leads to [<i>Oct4</i>] downregulation in up to 19% of the models.

We grouped signaling genes by their respective pathways (defined by GO categories) and assigned each group to a module based on its average expression pattern across the nine cell states. Because WNT and FGF modules show no changes in expression across all cell states (most likely due to the large number of genes that fall into the relevant GO categories), we focused on investigating the effects of LIF and BMP signaling on cells in the epiblast-like C<sub>1</sub> and in the bi-potent ectoderm-like state C<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>).

To discover distinct properties of the cell states in early mES cell differentiation, we built probabilistic models of the underlying network. Requiring these models to have discrete cell states leads to the prediction that each cell state has a\u00a0distinct response to perturbations by signals and changing levels of gene expression. Thus, the cell states we discovered can be functionally defined by their responses to perturbation. Our experimental tests show, as predicted by the model network, that <i>Oct4</i> is either downregulated or unaffected by overexpression of <i>Sox2</i> or <i>Snai1</i>, depending on the cell state. Previous studies have already shown that <i>Sox2</i> and <i>Oct4</i>, along with <i>Klf4</i>, constitute part of a positive feedback loop that stabilizes the pluripotent ground state (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Young, 2011</a>). It is also known that in undifferentiated cells, <i>Snai1</i> overexpression leads to downregulation of <i>Oct4</i> expression and, subsequently, to exit of pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib13\">Galvagni et al., 2015</a>). However, our results demonstrate that these interactions are state-dependent by showing that the effective positive interactions between <i>Sox2</i> and <i>Oct4</i> become destabilized as <i>Klf4</i> levels drop and cells transition to a primed, epiblast-like pluripotent state. Similarly, the negative interaction exerted by <i>Snai1</i> on <i>Oct4</i> becomes attenuated in the presence of early primitive streak genes such as <i>T</i>. We also predict and show that LIF+BMP exposure pushes bi-potent ectoderm-like cells toward an <i>Msx2</i>-positive neural crest-like state, but this effect is not seen in epiblast-like cells. These results are further supported by the fact that both LIF and BMP signaling pathways can be used to keep cells in the pluripotent cell state (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chambers, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Ying and Smith, 2003</a>), and that BMP signaling plays a significant role in the differentiation of neural crest cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Knecht and Bronner-Fraser, 2002</a>). Together, these findings signify that the inferred cell states directly reflect differences in cells\u2019 responses to perturbations and show that these cell states can also be defined by their unique responses to perturbations."

Despite this and the complexity of the underlying network, we discover that both cell states and the sequence of cell state transitions can be accurately determined by monitoring the levels of just a few transition or marker genes. Monitoring the expression dynamics of these key genes in live cells using microscopy will allow us in the future to continuously track the cell-fate decisions of individual cells. The inferred gene modules therefore represent the \u2018order parameters\u2019 by which cell-state transition dynamics can be directly measured. Live cell microscopy experiments will also allow us to measure, in conjunction with cell state transition dynamics, changes in individual cells\u2019 spatial environment, movement, lineage history, and cell cycle dynamics in order to address fundamental biological questions as to how these factors affect cell fate decisions. Finally, our results suggest that cell-to-cell heterogeneity within differentiating populations arises largely as a consequence of cells\u2019 variability in their timing of cell state transitions. Our inferred cell clusters show mixing of cells from different time points (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), suggesting that the observed states themselves do not change over time and that at the population level, differentiation occurs as a change in the proportions of cells in various cell states rather than through changes in the cell states themselves (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Since cells interpret perturbations differently even in consecutive states (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), this suggests that heterogeneity arising from timing variability is further amplified in response to signal addition or fluctuations in gene expression level. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding how the timing of cell state transitions is controlled during development."

In order to explain the discretization procedure let consider the example of Otx2, which is a transition gene for the triplet involving C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> clusters, where C<sub>1</sub> is the intermediate cluster. Since Otx2 is expressed at high levels in cluster C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> and is downregulated in cluster C<sub>2</sub>, we assigned it a value of 1 in clusters C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> respectively and 0 in cluster C<sub>2</sub>. We then repeated this local binarization process across all triplets along the lineage tree. We grouped all the genes that showed the same locally binarized expression pattern as Otx2 and obtained their average expression level across all the other clusters. Subsequently, we assigned these genes a value of 1 in a cluster if the average expression of these genes in that cluster was comparable (within\u00a0~10% of the mean) or higher than the lower value of their average expression level in the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> clusters. Some genes, such as Oct4 and Etv5 are re-used at multiple branching points i.e. they belong to multiple triplets, either as marker genes or transition genes, and hence belong to different groups (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Certain genes that are re-used exhibit three distinct levels of expression. For instance, Sox2 comes up as a marker gene for C<sub>0</sub> cluster, when we consider the triplets involving clusters C<sub>0</sub>, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>0</sub>, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> clusters respectively. However, it also acts as a transition gene for the triplet involving C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> clusters, where Sox2 is downregulated in C<sub>2</sub>. Such a gene expression pattern would require three distinct levels (high in C<sub>0</sub>, medium in C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, and low in C<sub>2</sub>). We classified the medium and higher expression level as one and low expression level as 0. It must be noted that we determined binary gene expression profiles by calculating the mean log2 fold-change in expression level for each group of genes.

Single cells were sorted with a FACSAria into 96 well plates containing 1.2 \u00b5L 2 \u00d7 CellsDirect Buffer (Life Technologies) with 0.1 \u00b5L of ERCCs diluted to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22126</sup> molecules (Life Technologies). Plates were frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For library preparation, mRNA was reverse transcribed using 0.15625 pmol of oligoT primer carrying a cell-specific 8 NT barcode and a 5 NT unique molecular identifier (UMI) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Islam et al., 2014</a>). Barcode design ensured at least two nucleotide differences from any other barcode. Samples were lysed at 70\u00b0C for 5 min, then reverse transcribed using Superscript III for two hours at 50\u00b0C, then primers digested with 1 \u00b5L of ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix). Second strand synthesis was carried out with Second Strand Synthesis Buffer, dNTPs, DNA Polymerase, and RNAse H (NEB) at 16\u00b0C for 2 hr. Single-cell cDNAs were pooled by 24 wells per library, with each library containing a water-only well and one ERCC-only well. Pools were purified with an equal volume of RNA Clean Beads (Beckman Coulter) and amplified at 37\u00b0C for 15 hr using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (NEB), and treated with DNAse I (Life Technologies). Amplified RNA was fragmented using the NEBNext RNA Fragmentation Module (NEB), purified with an equal volume of RNA Clean Beads, and visualized using the RNA Pico Kit on the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). The RNA fragments were repaired with Antarctic Phosphatase and Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB), and purified using an equal volume of RNA Clean Beads. cDNA libraries were made using the NEBNext Small Library Prep Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, except Superscript III was used for the RT step. Index primers were used in PCR amplification. Approximately 160\u2013200 nmol of a pool of libraries were size selected to exclude species smaller than 180 bp on a 2% Dye Free cassette on the Pippin Prep (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roccio et al., 2013</a>) and concentrated to approximately 14 \u00b5L. Pools were then quantified by qRT-PCR using p5 (5\u2019-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGA-3\u2019) and p7 (5\u2019-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-3\u2019) primers and by Bioanalyzer (DNA High Sensitivity Kit, Agilent), and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq. The custom sequencing primer: 5\u2019-TCTACACGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATC-3\u2019 was included with Illumina primer HP10 for sequencing. Standard Illumina primers HP12 and HP11 were used for the index read and the transcript read, respectively. PE50 kits (Illumina) were used for sequencing with read lengths of 25 nt, six nt, and 47 nt for read1 (cell barcode, UMI), index (library), and read2 (transcript), respectively. Following quantification, we discarded the data from wells that yielded below a total of 20,000 UMI (threshold based on empty well controls), which left us with 358 cells. Further, as others have recognized (<a href=\"#bib43\">Paul et al., 2015</a>), we found that some well-to-well mixing was present with CEL-Seq multiplexed single-cell RNA-Seq. We used the data only from 288 cells because of this mixing artifact."

The first part of the analysis relies on a companion manuscript, which presented a combined method for clustering and lineage inference of single cells. By applying this method on data from multiple mouse ES subject to short inductive differentiation protocols, the authors identify several cell states, the genes that mark these states, and the genes that capture state transitions. Within these clusters of cells, the authors assert there is little variation, thus defining discrete cell states along mES cell differentiation. They then cluster the genes into modules and use the Hopfield model to identify patterns of dependencies between modules that give rise to the observed clusters as steady states. With this analysis they provide and validate three hypotheses about possible \"rewiring\" at different stages (i.e. when the effect of perturbing gene X on gene Y varies between cell states)."
