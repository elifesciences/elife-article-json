To address the <i>in vivo</i> functions of miR-142, we utilized a novel reporter and a loss-of-function mouse allele that we have recently generated. In this study, we show that miR-142 is broadly expressed in the adult hematopoietic system. Our data further reveal that miR-142 is critical for megakaryopoiesis. Genetic ablation of miR-142 caused impaired megakaryocyte maturation, inhibition of polyploidization, abnormal proplatelet formation, and thrombocytopenia. Finally, we characterized a network of miR-142-3p targets which collectively control actin filament homeostasis, thereby ensuring proper execution of actin-dependent proplatelet formation. Our study reveals a pivotal role for miR-142 activity in megakaryocyte maturation and function, and demonstrates a critical contribution of a single miRNA in orchestrating cytoskeletal dynamics and normal hemostasis."

To address the <i>in vivo</i> functions of miR-142, we utilized a novel reporter and a loss-of-function mouse allele that we have recently generated. In this study, we show that miR-142 is broadly expressed in the adult hematopoietic system. Our data further reveal that miR-142 is critical for megakaryopoiesis. Genetic ablation of miR-142 caused impaired megakaryocyte maturation, inhibition of polyploidization, abnormal proplatelet formation, and thrombocytopenia. Finally, we characterized a network of miR-142-3p targets which collectively control actin filament homeostasis, thereby ensuring proper execution of actin-dependent proplatelet formation. Our study reveals a pivotal role for miR-142 activity in megakaryocyte maturation and function, and demonstrates a critical contribution of a single miRNA in orchestrating cytoskeletal dynamics and normal hemostasis."

We show that miR-142 controls multiple facets of MK differentiation including control of cell size, ploidy, and proplatelet elaboration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-142-3p controls platelet biosynthesis by orchestrating the coordinated expression of several distinct nodes in a network of actin cytoskeleton regulators. Our study reveals a novel miRNA-dependent circuit that maintains cytoskeletal integrity, and suggests that a single miRNA may broadly regulate cell function by controlling a coherent set of effectors in a given pathway."

We therefore tested the number of MK nuclei by flow cytometry. CD41<sup>+</sup> BM-derived miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs, exhibited reduced overall ploidy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Furthermore, the fraction of mature (\u226516N) miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs was significantly diminished, relative to WT controls, whereas the percentage of low ploidy immature MK forms (\u22648N) was higher in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> BM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Similar data were gained by <i>ex vivo</i> differentiation of FL-derived MKs, whereby high ploidy number (&gt;32) was observed in only 4% of the miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MK, relative to 12% in control MKs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Thus, miR-142 is essential for normal endomitosis and reduced miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> platelet numbers might result from accumulation of immature, low-polyploid MKs that are poor producers of platelets (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mattia et al., 2002</a>)."

To analyze whether miR-142 is involved in this process, we performed an <i>ex vivo</i> PPF study on FL-derived MKs. Remarkably, we observed a striking threefold reduction in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs that were extending proplatelets, relative to control MKs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). We next re-introduced miR-142-3p into differentiated MKs, using dsRNA mimetics (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The introduction of miR-142-3p was sufficient to recapitulate WT PPF levels in cells that are genetically miR-142-deficient (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Conversely, overexpression of miR-142-3p mimics in WT MKs did not yield any significant increase in PPF levels. Thus, miR-142-3p activity is essential for proper MK maturation and its loss results in defective platelet biogenesis. Furthermore, since re-introduction of miR-142-3p into miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> differentiated MKs restored functional identity, we conclude that there might be a continuous requirement for miR-142-3p activity to maintain MK maturity."

                                "text": "Gene ontology (GO) analysis using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID) algorithm (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang da et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2009b</a>) revealed perturbations of a variety of cellular processes in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). To enhance the power of our analysis, we next focused on targets that were commonly up-regulated in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs as well as in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> CD24<sup>+</sup> and CD24<sup>-</sup> in vitro-derived DCs that we previously characterized (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mildner et al., 2013</a>). Forty genes were found to be commonly up-regulated in all three miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> hematopoietic cell types (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). This list is highly enriched with direct miR-142-3p putative targets (12 out of 40 genes). Subsequent DAVID analysis performed on these genes uncovered a significant enrichment for actin- and cytoskeleton-related functional GO categories (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Indeed, half of the dozen predicted miR-142-3p targets encode for pivotal actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins, including Cofilin-2 (Cfl2), Glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding factor 1 (Grlf1), Biorientation of chromosomes in cell division 1 (Bod1), Integrin alpha V (Itgav), Twinfilin-1 (Twf1), and Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome-like (Wasl). Intriguingly, the latter was recently suggested as a potential target of miR-142-3p in the process of actin-mediated mycobacterial infection (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bettencourt et al., 2013</a>). The up-regulation of these six miR-142-3p targets in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs, was further confirmed by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Among these targets, Cfl2 expression was also found to be up-regulated in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MkPs (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Introducing of miR-142-3p into differentiated MKs, using dsRNA mimetics, was sufficient to normalize the expression levels of representative miR-142-3p targets, Wasl and Cfl2 in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Western blot analysis revealed up-regulation of the protein products of Wasl and Cfl2 in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs, further substantiating them as bona fide miR-142-3p targets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013G</a>). Using luciferase reporter assays, we showed that the mRNAs of Wasl, Cfl2, Grlf1, Itgav and Twf1 are directly targeted by miR-142-3p (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013J</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4</a>). Furthermore, the quantitative contributions of individual binding sites within the target 3\u2032 UTR was revealed by stepwise loss of miR-142 regulation, when miR-142-3p binding sites were sequentially mutated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013J</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4</a>). Taken together, we discovered that the expression of a compound set of actin cytoskeleton regulators is post-transcriptionally controlled by miR-142-3p."

                                "text": "miR-142-deficient MKs displayed perturbed actin filament dynamics and diminished proplatelet formation. This is presumably due to de-repression of several actin cytoskeleton components, including Wasl, Cfl2, Twf1, Itgav or Grlf1, which are all direct miR-142-3p targets. Thus, we hypothesized that knocking down these miR-142-3p targets may relieve the PPF defect in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs. For this purpose, we transduced FL-derived MKs with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing lentiviral vectors that effectively knocked-down targets with more than three miR-142-3p binding sites, namely Wasl, Cfl2 or Grlf1 (shWasl, shCfl2 and shGrlf1, respectively, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A lentivirus encoding a shRNA directed against RFP (shRFP) was employed as a control. Following transduction, differentiation of MKs was induced and PPF was quantified 3 days later. The PPF defect was clearly evident in miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs transduced with shRFP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). In contrast, miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs that were transduced with shRNA directed against Cfl2, Wasl, Grlf1, displayed a prominent elevation of PPF levels, and approximated levels observed in control WT MKs transduced with shRFP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). This strong elevation in PPF levels was limited to miR-142<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MKs, whereas in WT MKs, knockdown of miR-142-3p targets did not significantly alter PPF levels, except for Wasl-targeting shRNA that exhibited a modest increase in PPF efficacy following transduction (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Additional pairwise target comparison revealed compound relationships between miR-142-3p targets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Remarkably, knockdown of both Cfl2 and Wasl, which carry out opposing functions within the actin regulatory network, did not yield any significant increase in PPF levels in miR-142-deficient MKs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Conversely, concomitant Cfl2 and Grlf1 knockdown, two proteins that are important for destabilizing actin polymers, enhanced PPF in miR-142 null MKs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Lastly, a pool of shRNA against miR-142-3p targets was able to fully restore PPF capacity to WT levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). These data demonstrate that the expression of a set of actin cytoskeleton regulators should be tightly orchestrated by miR-142-3p in order to effectively promote platelet biogenesis."

Our analysis unveils the critical functions of miR-142 in the MK lineage. Using a recently-established mouse model, we show that deletion of the miR-142 allele results in pronounced thrombocytopenia. Our <i>in vivo</i> studies and culture assays reveal that proper miR-142 function is essential, in a cell-intrinsic manner, for MK maturation, including control of cell size, polyploidization and proplatelet elaboration."

These collectively contribute to MK maturation and their dysregulation is responsible for incomplete maturation observed in miR-142-deficient MKs. Very often, the sets of target genes that are predicted to be regulated by a particular miRNAs do not coalesce into coherent networks with distinct biological functions (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stark et al., 2005</a>). However, our work provides a clear example of an individual miRNA that co-regulates a network of functionally-associated targets. Indeed, the ability of a miRNA to modulate the expression of multiple targets within the same pathway simultaneously was previously suggested in other cellular contexts. For instance, the bicistronic miR-143/145 miRNA gene cluster dictates smooth-muscle cell phenotypic switching by orchestrating the expression of a cadre of cytoskeletal remodeling regulators (<a href=\"#bib73\">Xin et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, miR-125 family members control hematopoietic stem cell pool size by targeting a cohort of proapoptotic genes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ooi et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, a single miRNA that cumulatively targets several nodes within the same biological circuit may serve as an effective means to control cellular behavior."

Within this cytoskeletal regulatory network, the set of genes targeted by miR-142-3p contains components with divergent functions. For example, Cfl2 and Twf1 participate in disassembly of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bamburg, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Moseley et al., 2006</a>). Likewise, Grlf1 is a GTPase activating protein that has been implicated in disruption of the organized actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib39\">McGlade et al., 1993</a>). Wasl, on the other hand, promotes actin polymerization by catalyzing filament branching together with the Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rotty et al., 2013</a>). Thus, miR-142 deficiency destabilizes feedback loops required for actin filament homeostasis, stress fiber formation, and actin remodeling. This in turn impairs proplatelet generation and plausibly other MK-intrinsic cellular functions, such as endomitosis. It is also likely that additional miR-142-3p targets participate in the regulation of MK differentiation. For example, the over-representation of miR-142-deficient MkPs might result from a dysregulation of a distinct set of targets that are not necessarily related to actin regulation."

This might be related to a certain threshold in PPF levels that cannot be crossed, even when regulation of miR-142-3p is mimicked."

Images were compensated for fluorescent dye overlap by using single-stain controls. Analysis was done on in-focus single cell images as previously described (<a href=\"#bib16\">George et al., 2006</a>) with single cell gating, using the area and aspect ratio features. Cell area was calculated in square microns from brightfield images. Circularity was calculated as average distance of object boundary from center, divided by the variation of this distance. Thus, shapes approximating circle exhibited low variation and gained higher values (in arbitrary units). Actin polarity was calculated using the Delta Centroid XY feature, which calculates the distance (in microns) between image center (brightfield) and the intensity-weighted actin image center (higher values indicate increased polarity). The F/G actin ratio was calculated by dividing the corresponding pixel intensities for each cell."

Typically, a CAN-<i>\u03b3</i>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs aqueous suspension (1.0 ml, Fe: 1.93 mg/ml\u20131.93 mg total Fe, 0.0346 mmol Fe, ICP-AES measurement) was diluted in 25.0 ml double distilled water (ddH2O). For the nanoparticle functional shell, we used <i>b</i>-PEI<sub>25</sub>, which enables electrostatic binding of nucleosides and endosome destabilization by osmotic imbalance, leading to subsequent release of RNA into cell cytoplasm. Therefore, 10.13 mg of polycationic branched <i>b</i>-PEI<sub>25</sub>, (10.0 mg/ml stock solution, 0.4053 \u00b5mol, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were added to CAN-<i>\u03b3</i>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs at a 1:5.25 ratio (wt/wt). Mild <i>b</i>-PEI<sub>25</sub> coordinated coating was accomplished by overnight orbital shaking at room temperature.

Recent studies from zebrafish indicate important functions of miR-142 in HSC specification and differentiation (Lu X et al, Cell Research 2013; Nimmo et al., Dev Cell 2013). Although the current work focuses on megakaryopoiesis, the authors should at least discuss whether potential HSC defects could contribute to the observed defects in megakaryocytes. In particular, recent clonal analysis of HSCs indicates individual HSCs may contribute differently to distinct lineages (Lu R et al., Nature Biotech 2011). Since miR-142 is broadly expressed in almost all hematopoietic cells, these additional studies could provide critical insights for whether this miRNA has megakaryocyte-specific functions or more broadly involved in multiple cell types."

Furthermore, although multiple targets are all involved in regulating the actin dynamics, they have divergent functions as pointed out by the authors. For example, Cfl2, Twf1 and Grlf1 function in disassembly of actin filaments whereas Was1 promotes actin polymerization. Thus, it is critical to further dissect how the derepression of these targets contributes to the observed actin defects. Since the authors already knocked down individual targets with shRNA and, surprisingly, observed similar rescue between Grlf1/Cfl1 (disassembly factors) and Was1 (polymerization factor), they should address the issue how the dosage of these competing factors regulated by miR-142 plays important roles in the MK differentiation."

This effect was attributed to a cell intrinsic mechanism through the use of CD45.1/CD45.2 bone marrow chimera experiments. In complement with additional in vitro experiments, the authors conclude that miR-142 is important for maturation of megakaryocytes. The data presented in the manuscript supports this conclusion. Using genomic approaches, the authors identified a set of actin-related genes that were up-regulated upon miR-142 deletion. They suggest through 3'UTR reporter assays that these genes are direct targets of miR-142. Using RNAi techniques, the authors knocked down the expression of the actin-related genes in miR-142-/- cells and found that it rescued the ability of MKs to generate proplatelets using an in vitro proplatelet formation assay."

The ultimate experiments would be to show that RNAi of these genes could increase platelet generation and decrease MkP population in the miR-142-/- mice. However, this requires additional long and laborious experiments. Thus, the authors could alternatively provide further in vitro evidence along with the experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H-I</a> (see comment #8 among the minor points).

For example: Either Wasl or Cofilin knockdown restored PPF levels in miR-142-deficient MKs (i.e., recovered the wild-type phenotype). However, the knockdown of both targets simultaneously did not rescue the phenotype, presumably because of the opposing activity of Cofilin and Wasl on actin filamentous state. Another observation is that concomitant Cfl2 and Grlf1 knockdown, two proteins that are important for destabilizing actin polymers, enhanced PPF in miR-142 null MKs. The relevant Results section reads: \u201cAdditional pairwise target comparison revealed compound relationships between miR-142-3p targets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>). Remarkably, knockdown of both Cfl2 and Wasl, which carry out opposing functions within the actin regulatory network, did not yielded any significant increase in PPF levels in miR-142-deficient MKs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Conversely, concomitant Cfl2 and Grlf1 knockdown, two proteins that are important for destabilizing actin polymers, enhanced PPF in miR-142 null MKs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Lastly, a pool of shRNA against miR-142-3p targets was able to fully restore PPF capacity to WT levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A-C</a>).

Within this cytoskeletal regulatory network, the set of genes targeted by miR-142-3p contains components with divergent functions. For example, Cfl2 and Twf1 participate in disassembly of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bamburg, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Moseley et al., 2006</a>). Likewise, Grlf1 is a GTPase activating protein that has been implicated in disruption of the organized actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib39\">McGlade et al., 1993</a>). Wasl, on the other hand, promotes actin polymerization by catalyzing filament branching together with the Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rotty et al., 2013</a>). Thus, miR-142 deficiency destabilizes feedback loops required for actin filament homeostasis, stress fiber formation and actin remodeling. This in turn impairs proplatelet generation and plausibly other MK-intrinsic cellular functions.\u201d"
