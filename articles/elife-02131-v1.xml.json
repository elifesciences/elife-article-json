In plant cytokinesis, post-Golgi trafficking mediates a massive flow of vesicles that form the partitioning membrane but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify functionally redundant Arabidopsis ARF guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs) BIG1\u2013BIG4 as regulators of post-Golgi trafficking, mediating late secretion from the trans-Golgi network but not recycling of endocytosed proteins to the plasma membrane, although the TGN also functions as an early endosome in plants. In contrast, BIG1-4 are absolutely required for trafficking of both endocytosed and newly synthesized proteins to the cell\u2013division plane during cytokinesis, counteracting recycling to the plasma membrane. This change from recycling to secretory trafficking pathway mediated by ARF-GEFs confers specificity of cargo delivery to the division plane and might thus ensure that the partitioning membrane is completed on time in the absence of a cytokinesis-interphase checkpoint."

In plant cytokinesis, post-Golgi trafficking mediates a massive flow of vesicles that form the partitioning membrane but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify functionally redundant Arabidopsis ARF guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs) BIG1\u2013BIG4 as regulators of post-Golgi trafficking, mediating late secretion from the trans-Golgi network but not recycling of endocytosed proteins to the plasma membrane, although the TGN also functions as an early endosome in plants. In contrast, BIG1-4 are absolutely required for trafficking of both endocytosed and newly synthesized proteins to the cell\u2013division plane during cytokinesis, counteracting recycling to the plasma membrane. This change from recycling to secretory trafficking pathway mediated by ARF-GEFs confers specificity of cargo delivery to the division plane and might thus ensure that the partitioning membrane is completed on time in the absence of a cytokinesis-interphase checkpoint."

It is widely thought that this structure guides the vesicles bringing materials from the trans-Golgi network, but the details of this process are not fully understood."

These four proteins belong to a larger family of proteins that control the trafficking of vesicles within a cell. Richter et al show that a plant cell can lose up to three of these four proteins and still divide, as the plant can still grow and develop as normal. Thus, BIG1 to BIG4 appear to perform essentially the same role in the plant."

However, when a cell is dividing, these proteins switch to regulate both processes, but direct all the material to a new destination\u2014the newly forming membrane, instead of the established surface membrane. Richter et al. suggest that this switch is important to stop any recycling to the plasma membrane that might move material away from the new membrane. The next challenge will be to identify the molecular signals and mechanisms that enable the proteins BIG1 to BIG4 to re-route the recycling of membrane material during cell division."

In contrast to animals, the TGN also functions as an early endosome in plants and is a major trafficking hub where secretory, endocytic, recycling and vacuolar pathways intersect (<a href=\"#bib40\">Viotti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Reyes et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, it has been notoriously difficult to functionally delineate the recycling vs secretory pathways in plants. Sorting of cargo proteins occurs during the formation of transport vesicles, involving activation of small ARF GTPases by ARF guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs) and recruitment of specific coat proteins (<a href=\"#bib2\">Casanova, 2007</a>). Arabidopsis ARF-GEFs are related to human large ARF-GEFs, GBF1 or BIG1. Whereas the three GBF1-related members GNOM, GNL1 and GNL2 have been characterised in detail (<a href=\"#bib7\">Geldner et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Richter et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2012</a>), of the 5 BIG1-related ARF-GEFs only BIG5 has been analysed so far and implicated in pathogen response (MIN7) and endocytic traffic (BEN1) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nomura et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tanaka et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Tanaka et al., 2013</a>). Here, we show that ARF-GEFs BIG1-4 play a crucial role in post-Golgi traffic, which enables us to dissect the regulation of secretory and recycling pathways in interphase and cytokinesis."

Other triple mutants were growth-retarded only if the activity of the respective fourth gene was reduced to 50%. No quadruple mutants were recovered because BIG1-4 were essential in male reproduction, sustaining pollen tube growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). BIG1-4 functional redundancy would be consistent with the occurrence of <i>BIG1-4</i>-like single-copy or closely related sister genes in lower plants (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Although large ARF-GEFs are often inhibited by the fungal toxin brefeldin A (BFA), the SEC7 domain of BIG3 (At1g01960; formerly named BIG2 in <a href=\"#bib18\">Nielsen et al., 2006</a>; see nomenclature used by <a href=\"#bib4\">Cox et al., 2004</a>) displayed BFA-insensitive GDP/GTP exchange activity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib18\">Nielsen et al., 2006</a>). BFA treatment of <i>big3</i> mutants impaired seed germination and seedling root growth, in contrast to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). We engineered a BFA-resistant variant of the naturally BFA-sensitive ARF-GEF BIG4 by replacing amino acid residue methionine at position 695 with leucine, as previously described for the recycling ARF-GEF GNOM (<a href=\"#bib7\">Geldner et al., 2003</a>). Engineered BFA-resistant BIG4-YFP rescued BFA-inhibited seed germination of <i>big3</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The rescue activity of BFA-resistant BIG4 was comparable to that of BIG3 when both were expressed from the ubiquitin 10 (<i>UBQ10</i>) promoter whereas BFA-sensitive BIG4 did not at all rescue BFA-inhibited primary root growth of <i>big3</i> mutant seedlings (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Thus, BFA treatment of <i>big3</i> single mutants effectively causes conditional inactivation of BIG1-4 ARF-GEF function, providing us with a unique tool for studying BIG1-4-dependent trafficking in an organismic context."

This becomes apparent upon BFA treatment because of TGN aggregation into BFA compartments, as has been reported earlier for <i>HS::secGFP</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Viotti et al., 2010</a>). Vacuolar cargo proteins also pass through the TGN via multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to the vacuole (<a href=\"#bib25\">Reyes et al., 2011</a>). Soluble RFP fused to phaseolin vacuolar sorting sequence AFVY accumulated in BFA compartments in <i>big3</i> mutant, in contrast to wild-type (<a href=\"#bib30\">Scheuring et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013J</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F</a>). Endocytosed PM proteins are delivered to the vacuole for degradation, for example boron transporter BOR1 in response to high external boron concentration (<a href=\"#bib37\">Takano et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K\u2013N</a>). BFA treatment prevented boron-induced trafficking of BOR1 to the vacuole in <i>big3</i> mutant, but not in wild-type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L,N</a>). BOR1 was rapidly turned over in the vacuole of wild-type, leaving no trace of GFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>). As expected, ARF-GEF BIG4 and its putative cargo BOR1 co-localized in BFA compartments (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013I</a>). Thus, BIG1-4 mediate both late secretory and vacuolar trafficking from the TGN."

In contrast to wild-type, KNOLLE targeting to the division plane was inhibited in BFA-treated <i>big3</i> mutants, with KNOLLE accumulating in BFA compartments together with BIG4-YFP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Cell-plate formation was disrupted, resulting in binucleate cells, which sometimes displayed cell-wall stubs (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). We used the non-cycling plasma-membrane syntaxin SYP132 expressed from the strong mitosis-specific <i>KN</i> promoter as another secretory marker for trafficking to the cell\u2013division plane (<a href=\"#bib23\">Reichardt et al., 2011</a>). SYP132 also accumulated, together with KN, in BFA compartments of BFA-treated <i>big3</i> mutants, in contrast to BFA-treated wild-type (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013J</a>). We also analysed endocytosed plasma-membrane proteins PEN1 and PIN1 for BFA-sensitive trafficking to the cell plate in <i>big3</i> mutants. PEN1 syntaxin involved in non-host immunity accumulates at the pathogen entry site by GNOM-dependent relocation following endocytosis from other regions of the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib3\">Collins et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Nielsen et al., 2012</a>). PEN1 continually cycles between plasma membrane and endosomes in interphase and accumulates at the cell plate in cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Reichardt et al., 2011</a>). To make sure that we were only looking at endocytosed PEN1, PEN1 was expressed from a histone H4 expression cassette that limits protein synthesis to S phase (<a href=\"#bib23\">Reichardt et al., 2011</a>). In wild-type, BFA treatment inhibited PEN1 recycling to the plasma membrane but not its trafficking to the cell plate (<a href=\"#bib23\">Reichardt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013I</a>). In contrast, in BFA-treated <i>big3</i> mutants, endocytosed PEN1 was not trafficked to the cell division plane but accumulated, together with KNOLLE, in BFA compartments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J\u2013L</a>, asterisks). Endocytosed PIN1 trafficked, like KNOLLE, to the cell plate in BFA-treated wild-type but both PIN1 and KNOLLE were trapped in BFA compartments of <i>big3</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5M\u2013R</a>). Expression of engineered BFA-resistant GNOM did not overcome the trafficking block to the division plane but rather diverted PIN1 to the basal plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5S\u2013X</a>; compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5X</a> with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5R</a>). Careful analysis of mitotic cells revealed polar accumulation of PIN1 at the plasma membrane of BFA-resistant GNOM seedling roots throughout mitosis while additional PIN1 accumulates at the forming and expanding cell plate, suggesting that trafficking to the plane of division and polar recycling to the plasma membrane occur simultaneously (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, both endocytosed and newly-synthesized plasma-membrane proteins require secretory ARF-GEF function BIG1-4 for trafficking to the plane of cell division."

The BFA insensitivity of the secretory pathway depends on the BFA resistance of ARF-GEF GNL1, which mediates COPI-vesicle formation in retrograde Golgi-ER traffic (<a href=\"#bib37a\">Teh and Moore, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Richter et al., 2007</a>), and also requires another BFA-resistant ARF-GEF acting in post-Golgi traffic to the plasma membrane. Here we show that ARF-GEFs BIG1-4 act at the TGN to mediate secretion of newly synthesized proteins to the plasma membrane in interphase but not recycling of endocytosed plasma-membrane proteins, and that BIG3 is BFA-resistant, unlike GNOM involved in recycling to the plasma membrane. Thus, there are two distinct trafficking pathways from the TGN to the plasma membrane in interphase. This is best illustrated by the trafficking of auxin-efflux carrier PIN1 - whereas newly synthesized PIN1 requires BIG1-4 on the late secretory pathway for non-polar delivery to the plasma membrane, polar PIN1 recycling to the basal plasma membrane solely depends on ARF-GEF GNOM (see model in <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

In general, recycling to the plasma membrane appears to be switched off during cytokinesis. Here we show that secretory ARF-GEFs BIG1-4 are essential for protein trafficking to the plane of cell division, regardless of proteins being newly synthesized or endocytosed from the plasma membrane (see model in <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Rather than substituting for BIG1-4 in traffic to the plane of cell division, recycling ARF-GEF GNOM appeared to counteract that process by promoting PIN1 recycling to the basal plasma membrane. Of course, the critical question is whether both processes occur at the same time or whether GNOM-dependent PIN1 recycling only sets in after trafficking to the cell plate has come to an end. Although there are no time-course studies, which would be difficult to perform because the process is very fast, detailed analysis of dividing cells at different mitotic stages revealed that polar recycling mediated by BFA-resistant GNOM occurs throughout mitosis and cytokinesis. Furthermore, only in the absence of both BFA-resistant BIG3 and BFA-resistant GNOM is PIN1 trapped in BFA compartments. If then BFA-resistant GNOM is expressed PIN1 is not delivered to the plane of division but rather polarly recycled to the plasma membrane, again suggesting that the latter pathway is a direct route bypassing the cell plate. PIN1 might be exceptional because continuous recycling of PIN1 is required for maintaining the polar transport of auxin across tissues (<a href=\"#bib7\">Geldner et al., 2003</a>). If PIN1 recycling were shut down during cytokinesis this would disrupt the polar auxin transport required in specific developmental situations such as forming lateral root primordia when essentially all cells proliferate (<a href=\"#bib10\">Geldner et al., 2004</a>). Another problem in auxin flow arises from cell division when the partitioning membrane has physically separated the two daughter cells: one daughter suddenly has PIN1 located at opposite ends. Obviously, PIN1 has to be removed from the wrong end in order to sustain polar auxin transport. This seems to be a fast process and has been studied for the related auxin-efflux carrier PIN2 in detail (<a href=\"#bib14\">Men et al., 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "Animal and plant cytokinesis differ in the way the partitioning membrane is laid down. In animals, secretory and recycling pathways contribute to the ingrowth of the plasma membrane mediated by a contractile actomyosin ring and to the subsequent abscission of the daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schiel and Prekeris, 2013</a>). In plants, a massive flow of membrane vesicles from TGN/early endosome to the plane of cell division sustains, by fusion, the rapid formation and outward expansion of the partitioning cell plate (<a href=\"#bib29\">Samuels et al., 1995</a>). This process is orchestrated by a specialised cytoskeletal array termed phragmoplast that delivers those membrane vesicles to the division plane. Phragmoplast-assisted trafficking might be required for completing the partitioning membrane on time, in the absence of a cytokinesis-interphase checkpoint, and would thus effectively rule out recycling of endocytosed proteins to the plasma membrane. However, our results make clear that this is not the case because recycling to the plasma membrane is not switched off during cytokinesis. Rather, endocytosed proteins enter the late-secretory pathway to reach the division plane at the expense of being recycled to the plasma membrane, which requires the late-secretory ARF-GEFs BIG1-4. In conclusion, our results raise the possibility that in general, different ARF-GEFs have different specificity of action during vesicle formation such that the same cargo protein can be delivered to different destinations."

The reviewers consider this is a significant claim because the identity of the cell-plate pathway and its relationship to pathways that operate in interphase has been a longstanding unresolved controversy.

This implies that recycling continues during cytokinesis so traffic to the cell plate requires sorting of PIN1 away from that pathway into the BIG1-4 pathway. I think the authors are using the presence of the cytokinesis-specific syntaxin KNOLLE to identify cells undergoing cytokinesis. Normally this is reasonable because KNOLLE is so rapidly degraded in the vacuole after cytokinesis but I am concerned here that in BFA-treated <i>big3</i> plants KNOLLE may be artificially stabilised as trafficking to the vacuole is inhibited under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Indeed the extensive labelling of whole files of cells is unusual for a marker of cytokinesis suggesting that there may be temporal stability. Treatment seems to have been for 3 h so the majority of cells that contain KNOLLE may have gone through (failed) cytokinesis some time ago. Isn't it possible that recycling to the plasma membrane does not in fact occur during cytokinesis, that endocytosed PIN1 accumulated in BFA-compartments during cytokinesis, but was recycled back to the PM in the subsequent G1. If so the important change could be the inhibition of the GN-pathway during cytokinesis causing endocytosed proteins to enter the default secretory pathway at the TGN, rather than any regulatory role for BIGs."

I also think that it would be important to ask whether newly-synthesised PIN1 is trapped in interphase BFA compartments in <i>big3</i> and <i>big3</i> GN<sup>R</sup>. To resolve the second question, perhaps photoswitchable fluorescent proteins which are available may also be suitable though I realise that they are not easy to image. Protein could be photoconverted in the BFA compartment of BFA-treated Col and followed over time to look at its rate of return to the PM versus the cell plate when cells enter cytokinesis \u2013 I don't recall this specific experiment being been done before."

The photoswitch experiment or similar is much more demanding but without it there is ambiguity about whether anything really changes with respect to PIN1 trafficking during cytokinesis, a major claim of the paper. If this point remains unclarified, we think the Discussion and title will need to change to reflect this."

Unlike KN, these markers are not likely affected by changes in trafficking conditions. We detected PIN1 polar accumulation at the basal plasma membrane at all mitotic stages from metaphase to anaphase to telophase as well as during initiation, expansion and completion of the cell plate, revealing progression of cytokinesis. During cytokinesis, polar accumulation at the PM was accompanied by accumulation at the cell plate when both BFA-resistant BIG3 was present and GNOM was rendered BFA-resistant."
