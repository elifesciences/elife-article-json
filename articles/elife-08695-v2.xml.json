                    "text": "Axon injury triggers a series of changes in the axonal cytoskeleton that are prerequisites for effective axon regeneration. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> the signaling protein Exchange Factor for ARF-6 (EFA-6) is a potent intrinsic inhibitor of axon regrowth. Here we show that axon injury triggers rapid EFA-6-dependent inhibition of axonal microtubule (MT) dynamics, concomitant with relocalization of EFA-6. EFA-6 relocalization and axon regrowth inhibition require a conserved 18-aa motif in its otherwise intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. The EFA-6 N-terminus binds the MT-associated proteins TAC-1/Transforming-Acidic-Coiled-Coil, and ZYG-8/Doublecortin-Like-Kinase, both of which are required for regenerative growth cone formation, and which act downstream of EFA-6. After injury TAC-1 and EFA-6 transiently relocalize to sites marked by the MT minus end binding protein PTRN-1/Patronin. We propose that EFA-6 acts as a bifunctional injury-responsive regulator of axonal MT dynamics, acting at the cell cortex in the steady state and at MT minus ends after injury."

In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> the signaling protein Exchange Factor for ARF-6 (EFA-6) is a potent intrinsic inhibitor of axon regrowth. Here we show that axon injury triggers rapid EFA-6-dependent inhibition of axonal microtubule (MT) dynamics, concomitant with relocalization of EFA-6. EFA-6 relocalization and axon regrowth inhibition require a conserved 18-aa motif in its otherwise intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. The EFA-6 N-terminus binds the MT-associated proteins TAC-1/Transforming-Acidic-Coiled-Coil, and ZYG-8/Doublecortin-Like-Kinase, both of which are required for regenerative growth cone formation, and which act downstream of EFA-6. After injury TAC-1 and EFA-6 transiently relocalize to sites marked by the MT minus end binding protein PTRN-1/Patronin. We propose that EFA-6 acts as a bifunctional injury-responsive regulator of axonal MT dynamics, acting at the cell cortex in the steady state and at MT minus ends after injury."

These cells have long thin projections called axons that allow the information to pass very quickly along the cell to junctions with other neurons. Neurons in adult mammals are limited in their ability to regenerate, so any damage to axons, for example, due to a stroke or a brain injury, tends to be permanent. Therefore, an important goal in neuroscience research is to discover the genes and proteins that are involved in regenerating axons as this may make it possible to develop new therapies."

Changes in the cytoskeleton are required to allow neurons to regenerate axons after injury, and drugs that stabilize filaments called microtubules in the cytoskeleton can promote these changes. Chen et al. used a technique called laser microsurgery to sever individual axons in a roundworm known as <i>C. elegans</i> and then observed whether these axons could regenerate. The experiments reveal that a protein called EFA-6 blocks the regeneration of neurons by preventing rearrangements in the cytoskeleton."

However, Chen et al. show that when the axon is damaged, this protein rapidly moves to areas near the ends of microtubule filaments. EFA-6 interacts with two other proteins that are associated with microtubules and are required for axons to be able to regenerate. Chen et al.'s findings demonstrate that several proteins that regulate microtubule filaments play a key role in regenerating axons. All three of these proteins are found in humans and other animals so they have the potential to be targeted by drug therapies in future. The next challenge is to understand the details of how EFA-6 activity is affected by axon injury, and how this alters the cytoskeleton."

Both the nature of the extracellular environment and the intrinsic growth competence of the neuron contribute to the extent of axon regeneration (<a href=\"#bib9\">Case and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005</a>). The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) expresses a variety of environmental regeneration inhibitory factors, including myelin-associated proteins, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and glial scar tissue that functions as a physical barrier (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schwab, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Silver and Miller, 2004</a>). However genetic removal of these inhibitory factors results in only limited improvement in regeneration of severed axons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2010</a>). Recent studies have strongly supported the importance of cell-intrinsic determinants in axon regeneration. Loss of function in cell-intrinsic growth inhibitors such as Phosphatase and Tensin homolog, PTEN, and Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling-3, SOCS3, can dramatically improve axon regrowth even in the inhibitory CNS environment (<a href=\"#bib43\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sun et al., 2011</a>). Genetic and pharmacological manipulation of cell autonomous signaling pathways can dramatically improve regrowth of severed axons in various injury paradigms (<a href=\"#bib38\">Moore et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hellal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sengottuvel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Shin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Watkins et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ruschel et al., 2015</a>)."

Cellular compartments undergoing rapid morphological changes, such as axonal growth cones, are enriched in dynamic MTs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Suter et al., 2004</a>), while mature axons or dendrites contain predominantly stabilized MTs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baas et al., 1993</a>). When an axon is injured, MTs are locally disassembled or severed, potentially creating free plus ends for new MT polymerization. Subsequently, the number of growing MTs increases, followed by more persistent MT growth correlated with formation of regenerative growth cone and axon extension (<a href=\"#bib16\">Erez and Spira, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012</a>). Complete removal of an axon also leads to dramatic upregulation of MT dynamics in the soma and dendrites (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stone et al., 2010</a>). MT disorganization contributes to dystrophic end bulb formation after injury in CNS (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ert\u00fcrk et al., 2007</a>). Moderate stabilization of MT dynamics by Taxol or other MT stabilizers can promote axon regrowth in vitro and in the mammalian CNS (<a href=\"#bib58\">Usher et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hellal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sengottuvel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ruschel et al., 2015</a>); the effects of Taxol in vivo have been partly replicated (<a href=\"#bib45\">Popovich et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ruschel et al., 2015</a>)<i>.</i> Thus, there is a critical need to define the endogenous regulators of MTs after injury."

The EFA-6/EFA6 protein family is conserved from yeast to mammals, and is defined by its Sec7 domain, which confers guanine exchange factor (GEF) activity for Arf6 GTPases (<a href=\"#bib18\">Franco et al., 1999</a>). Unexpectedly, the regrowth-inhibitory function of EFA-6 is independent of its GEF activity, and instead is mediated by its N-terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). The EFA-6 N-terminal domain inhibits MT growth at the cell cortex of <i>C. elegans</i> embryos via a conserved motif of 18 amino acids (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Rourke et al., 2010</a>).

We show that the EFA-6 N-terminal domain interacts with MT associated proteins TAC-1, a member of the transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) family, and ZYG-8, an ortholog of doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK). TAC-1 and ZYG-8 are required for initiation of axon regeneration, and their overexpression can promote regrowth. We further show that injury triggers relocalization of EFA-6 and TAC-1 to sites overlapping with the MT minus end binding protein Patronin/PTRN-1. We propose that EFA-6 is a bifunctional injury-responsive regulator of MT dynamics, acting at the cell cortex in the steady state and at MT minus ends after axon injury."

To determine the subcellular location of EFA-6 in neurons, we expressed a series of GFP-tagged EFA-6 fusion proteins. Full-length EFA-6 tagged with GFP at the N- or C-termini, expressed at a range of concentrations, localized to the plasma membrane of the soma and processes of neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>); deletion of the PH domain (FL\u0394PH) resulted in cytosolic localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, upper panel).

                                "text": "We next examined how axon injury affected EFA-6 localization. Within seconds of laser axotomy of the PLM axon, GFP::EFA-6FL redistributed from a generally even plasma membrane localization to more discrete puncta (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This relocalization was also observed when GFP was tagged to the C terminus or in the middle of EFA-6 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and did not require the PH domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). GFP::EFA-6N150, although not membrane associated, also became punctate after injury, whereas GFP::EFA-6FL\u0394N150 did not relocalize after axon injury (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Full-length EFA-6 and the N terminal domain (N150) appear to relocalize to the same puncta in response to injury, as shown by co-expressing EFA-6FL::GFP and EFA-6N150::mKate2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). mKate2::EFA-6N150\u039418 (which does not relocalize, see below) did not co-localize with EFA-6FL::GFP after injury, suggesting EFA-6 puncta are not due to non-specific aggregation of proteins after injury (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The region of relocalized EFA-6FL or EFA-6N150 expanded bidirectionally from the injury site at \u223c8 \u03bcm s<sup>\u22121</sup>, into the soma and dendrite (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The density of injury-triggered puncta of EFA-6FL and EFA-6N150 gradually decreased over the next 20\u201360 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). We observed similar re-localization of GFP::EFA-6 after injury of motor neuron axons (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D,E</a>), as well as when injury was delivered to the soma, distal axon, or posterior processes of mechanosensory neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>). These results indicate that injury-triggered EFA-6 relocalization occurs in multiple neuron types, irrespective of the site of injury and independent of the Sec7 or PH domains. The N-terminal 1\u201370 aa (N70) was the smallest fragment tested that displayed relocalization after injury (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). We tested a variety of other neuronal proteins, including the MT plus-end binding proteins EBP-1 and EBP-2, KLP-7/kinesin-13 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012</a>), ARF-6 (the presumed substrate for EFA-6's GEF activity), SAX-3 (transmembrane receptor) and synaptic vesicle proteins (SNB-1/synaptobrevin, RAB-3/GTPase, UNC-57/endophilin), and found that none showed similar relocalization after axon injury (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3G</a>, and data not shown). Thus, injury-triggered relocalization is specific to EFA-6."

We therefore tested if the capacity of EFA-6 protein fragments to relocalize correlated with their effects on PLM development and regrowth. We found that overexpression of the EFA-6 N terminal fragments that displayed injury-induced relocalization (N150, N100, N70) all caused axons of PLM neurons to undershoot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We performed axotomy on those axons that exhibited normal morphology in L4 larvae and found that these axons all showed significantly reduced regrowth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In contrast, overexpression of smaller fragments (N24, N42 or N[43\u201370 aa]) of the EFA-6 N-terminus that did not relocalize in response to axotomy did not significantly inhibit PLM outgrowth or regrowth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Interestingly, overexpression of EFA-6FL\u0394N150, but not of EFA-6FL, caused PLM overshooting, suggesting the C-terminal region of EFA-6 may inhibit the activity of the N-terminus. Overexpression of EFA-6FL strongly inhibits axonal MT dynamics, as assessed using the EBP-GFP assay for growing MT plus ends (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). Using live imaging and quantitative kymograph analysis of EBP-2::GFP comets, we found that only those EFA-6 fragments displaying injury-induced relocalization also inhibited steady-state axonal MT dynamics when overexpressed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These observations suggest the ability of EFA-6 protein fragments to inhibit axon growth and MT dynamics closely correlates with their ability to relocalize in response to injury."

We found that full length EFA-6 lacking the motif, GFP::EFA-6FL\u039418, localized to the plasma membrane but did not cause axonal developmental defects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1G, 2C</a>). GFP::EFA-6N150 was diffuse in the cytosol and excluded from the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Deletion of the 18 aa motif from the N-terminus (N150\u039418) abolished this nuclear exclusion, largely resembling free GFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Overexpression of EFA-6N150\u039418 also did not cause developmental abnormalities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Pan-neural overexpression of EFA-6N150, but not of EFA-6N150\u039418, caused aberrant locomotion (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), suggesting that high levels of EFA-6 N-terminal domain perturb function of many neurons, in a manner dependent on the 18 aa motif. Moreover, mutating 2 or more residues within the 18 aa motif to alanines significantly reduced the activity of the N-terminus in multiple assays (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting the sequence of the 18 aa motif is critical for the N-terminus to function. The 18 aa motif was essential for injury-triggered relocalization of EFA-6FL and EFA-6N150 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>), as well as for their inhibitory effects in axon regrowth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Both mutations cause embryonic phenotypes similar to <i>efa-6</i> RNAi (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Rourke et al., 2010</a>) and display similarly enhanced axon regrowth (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). As these mutations do not delete the N-terminus, it is possible that truncated proteins might be produced in these mutants. We therefore generated a targeted deletion, <i>efa-6(ju1200),</i> that removes the genomic sequences encoding the 18 aa motif (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). The axon developmental and regrowth phenotypes of <i>efa-6(ju1200)</i> mutants were indistinguishable from those of <i>efa-6(tm3124)</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). In addition, single copy transgene expression of EFA-6N150 (<i>juSi86</i>) rescued the regeneration defects of both <i>efa-6(tm3124)</i> and <i>efa-6(ju1200)</i> to similar degrees (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), and also rescued developmental axon overgrowth (not shown). Thus, the increased axon regrowth of <i>efa-6</i> mutants reflects a complete loss of EFA-6 function, and the major activity of EFA-6 in axon growth resides in the N-terminus, dependent on the 18 aa motif.

We identified two strong interactors, the MT-associated proteins (MAPs) TAC-1 and ZYG-8.

ZYG-8 is required for spindle positioning in embryos (<a href=\"#bib21\">G\u00f6nczy et al., 2001</a>), and for normal axonal MT architecture in post-mitotic neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bellanger et al., 2012</a>). TAC-1 is the sole TACC protein in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bellanger and G\u00f6nczy, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Le Bot et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Srayko et al., 2003</a>) and can form a complex with ZYG-8 to regulate MT assembly in embryos (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellanger et al., 2007</a>).

TAC-1 and ZYG-8 interacted by two-hybrid assay, and TAC-1 interacted strongly with ZYG-8\u0394KD (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To independently verify these interactions we transfected tagged proteins in HEK293 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation. We found that TAC-1 co-immunoprecipitated with EFA-6N150, but not with EFA-6N150\u039418 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Likewise, ZYG-8 and EFA-6N150 could be co-immunoprecipitated when coexpressed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These studies suggest that TAC-1 and ZYG-8 specifically interact with the EFA-6 N-terminus. We further tested binding of EFA-6 to TAC-1 and ZYG-8 in cells co-transfected with EFA-6N150, TAC-1 and ZYG-8\u0394KD. After immunoprecipitation of EFA-6N150 we could detect both TAC-1 and ZYG-8, and the interactions between EFA-6 and TAC-1 (or ZYG-8) were not affected by the presence of ZYG-8 (or TAC-1) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This result suggests that EFA-6, TAC-1, and ZYG-8 might exist in the same ternary complex."

As the extent to which these ts mutations impair gene function in post-mitotic cells is not known, we further examined PLM regrowth in <i>tac-1(ok3305)</i> null mutants (here denoted <i>tac-1(0)</i>) using a genetic mosaic strategy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We rescued the maternal-effect embryonic lethality of <i>tac-1(0)</i> mutants with a single copy insertion transgene expressing a floxed version of <i>tac-1(+)</i> (<i>juSi148</i> or <i>juSi162</i>) (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We then deleted <i>tac-1(+)</i> specifically in touch neurons by expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the <i>mec-7</i> promoter. Cre-mediated deletion of <i>tac-1(+)</i> occurred in 8/8 transgenic (<i>juSi162;</i> P<i>mec-7-</i>Cre<i>)</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), suggesting Cre-mediated recombination was efficient<i>.</i> In animals with touch neuron specific deletion of <i>tac-1</i>, the PLM axon developed normally, but axon regrowth was impaired to a degree similar to <i>tac-1(lf)</i> mutants after L1 upshift (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that TAC-1 functions cell autonomously in PLM axon regrowth."

To test whether MT dynamics might be influenced by EFA-6 immediately after injury, we examined the acute effects of axon injury on MT dynamics. In wild type animals, axonal EBP-2::GFP comets were dramatically reduced within 50 s post axotomy, consistent with injury triggering rapid MT destabilization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In <i>efa-6(tm3124)</i> or <i>efa-6(ju1200)</i> mutants we observed slightly increased numbers of EBP-2::GFP comets in uninjured axons, compared to wild type; but these animals did not show a significant reduction in EBP-2::GFP comets immediately after injury (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The slight reduction in axonal comets after injury in <i>efa-6(0)</i> suggests that some MTs can also be downregulated independent of EFA-6. In <i>efa-6(gf)</i> animals overexpressing EFA-6N150, the total number of growing MT plus ends in uninjured axons was reduced compared to wild type, and was not further reduced after injury (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). <i>tac-1(lf)</i> mutants had slightly reduced axonal MT dynamics in uninjured axons, and displayed injury-dependent downregulation, whereas <i>zyg-8(lf)</i> mutants showed fewer dynamic MTs in uninjured axons, and did not further downregulate MTs after injury (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The mild phenotype in <i>tac-1(lf)</i> could be due to incomplete loss of function of this ts allele. We further tested the <i>tac-1(ok3305)</i> deletion allele using Cre-induced tissue-specific knockout (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Compared to control, <i>tac-1(0)</i> touch neurons displayed reduced dynamics in uninjured axons similar to <i>zyg-8(lf)</i>, and showed no further reduction after injury (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As reported previously, dynamic axonal MTs are significantly increased at 3 hr post axotomy, and this is further enhanced in <i>efa-6(0)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Neither <i>tac-1(lf)</i> nor <i>zyg-8(lf)</i> mutants upregulated dynamic axonal MTs by 3 hr post injury (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Moreover, MT dynamics in <i>efa-6(0) tac-1(lf)</i> or <i>efa-6(0) zyg-8(lf)</i> double mutants resembled <i>tac-1(lf)</i> or <i>zyg-8(lf)</i> single mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), consistent with EFA-6 functioning upstream of ZYG-8. Thus, axon injury causes an immediate inhibition in growing MTs, dependent on EFA-6 and correlating with its relocalization, followed by a more prolonged increase in growing MTs, dependent on the function of TAC-1 and ZYG-8."

We considered the possibility that, after injury, TAC-1 and EFA-6 relocalized to axonal MTs. As the punctate localization of TAC-1 and EFA-6 does not resemble that of EBP-2::GFP (i.e., growing MT plus ends), we tested whether TAC-1 and EFA-6 were becoming localized to MT minus ends. PTRN-1 is the <i>C. elegans</i> member of the Patronin/CAMSAP family, known to bind to and stabilize MT minus ends (<a href=\"#bib37\">Meng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yau et al., 2014</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i> neurons PTRN-1 localizes to axonal puncta, likely the sites of MT minus ends (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chuang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Marcette et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Richardson et al., 2014</a>). GFP::PTRN-1 localization does not dramatically change after axon injury (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chuang et al., 2014</a>), while in the same time period EFA-6N150::mKate2 became punctate and partially colocalized with GFP::PTRN-1, independent of the tagged reporters (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similarly, after injury TAC-1::mKate2 became highly colocalized with GFP::PTRN-1 (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These observations suggest that axon injury causes TAC-1 to relocalize to PTRN-1-containing puncta, and causes EFA-6 to relocalize to regions overlapping with or closely adjacent to the TAC-1/PTRN-1 puncta."

Our studies reveal that axonal injury triggers an intricate sequence of alterations in axonal MT dynamics.

In mature neurons EFA-6 localizes to the cell membrane via its PH domain. <i>efa-6((0))</i> mutant axons display elevated numbers of growing MTs in the steady state, and display impenetrant developmental overgrowth, indicating that in the absence of injury EFA-6 restrains axonal MT dynamics and mildly inhibits axon outgrowth. These steady-state roles of EFA-6 are mediated by the N-terminus, as they are fully rescued by expression of the N-terminal 150 aa. Overexpression of either full length EFA-6 or the N-terminus causes axons to undershoot, whereas overexpression of EFA-6\u0394N causes axons to overshoot. The opposing effects of overexpression of the N-terminus and the C-terminus suggest that in the steady state the EFA-6 N-terminus might be inhibited by the remainder of the protein."

As relocalized full-length EFA-6 appears to remain membrane associated, it is possible that after injury EFA-6 localizes to the cytoskeleton via its N terminus while remaining membrane associated via its PH domain.

The N-termini of <i>C. elegans, Drosophila</i> and mammalian EFA6 proteins all have a high probability of intrinsic disorder. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and disordered protein regions are increasingly recognized as having important biological activities (<a href=\"#bib42\">Oldfield and Dunker, 2014</a>). Well-studied examples of IDPs in the nervous system include the MT-binding proteins Tau (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schweers et al., 1994</a>) and stathmin (<a href=\"#bib26\">Honnappa et al., 2006</a>). Intrinsic disorder does not imply a lack of structure, but rather allows these regions to function as binding surfaces with multiple interacting partners; IDPs are often hubs in protein\u2013protein interaction networks (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cumberworth et al., 2013</a>). In the EFA-6 N-terminus the 18 aa motif is predicted to have relative structural order, and might act as a molecular recognition feature as in other IDPs. The 18 aa motif is critical for EFA-6 relocalization and for the EFA-6 N-terminus to interact with ZYG-8 and TAC-1. Moreover, as mutation of two or more residues within the 18 aa motif impairs its activity, both the exact sequence of the 18 aa motif and the surrounding extended intrinsically disordered domain appear to be critical for the ability of the EFA-6 N-terminus to regulate MT dynamics. In some assays, the requirement for the 18 aa motif in EFA-6 function was not all-or-none, suggesting it may facilitate the function of the surrounding interacting domain. Moreover, neither ZYG-8 nor TAC-1 may directly bind the 18 aa motif; the motif may be important for correct folding of the larger N-terminal interacting domain."

TAC-1 and ZYG-8 interact physically, but localize independently (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellanger et al., 2007</a>). However EFA-6, TAC-1, and ZYG-8 are all present in axons, suggesting these proteins may interact directly in differentiated cells. TAC-1 and EFA-6 partly colocalize after injury, consistent with their interaction being regulated by injury. Although ZYG-8 localization appeared unaffected by injury, it is predicted to associate along the length of MTs, and so could also interact with EFA-6 after injury. Notably, loss of function of TAC-1 or ZYG-8 did not detectably affect developmental axon outgrowth, but strongly blocked axon regeneration, indicating regenerative regrowth is highly dependent on these MAPs."

TACC proteins can act both at plus and minus ends of centrosomal MTs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Peset and Vernos, 2008</a>). Localization of human TACC3 to minus ends is regulated by Aurora A dependent phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barros et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">LeRoy et al., 2007</a>). Conversely, Doublecortin (DCX) decorates the length of the MT lattice and stabilizes it (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moores et al., 2006</a>). DCX can also track MT plus ends, and acts as a nucleation factor, stabilizing polymerization intermediates (<a href=\"#bib39\">Moores et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bechstedt and Brouhard, 2012</a>). Like DCX, DCLK is thought to be able to interact with MTs along their length (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burgess and Reiner, 2000</a>). Our results suggest that after axon injury, TAC-1, EFA-6, and possibly ZYG-8 may interact with one another at specific subregions of MTs at or adjacent to minus ends. As EFA-6 has opposite effects to TAC-1 and ZYG-8, EFA-6 may transiently inhibit the activity of TAC-1 or ZYG-8, resulting in the rapid disruption of axonal MT growth. Following this initial phase, EFA-6 returns to its steady state, relieving the inhibition of TAC-1 and ZYG-8, which are then required for the later upregulation of axonal MT dynamics."

Strikingly, EFA-6 and TAC-1 relocalize close to or at these sites after injury, suggesting MT minus ends may be an important site of regulation. As PTRN-1 itself is not required for EFA-6 or TAC-1 relocalization, other proteins may be involved in their targeting. Indeed, the near-normal development and behavior of <i>ptrn-1</i> null mutants suggests additional factors can stabilize MT minus ends in noncentrosomal arrays.

Although a small decrease in MT dynamics was observed in <i>efa-6</i> mutants, this was not statistically significant, and calculations of statistical power suggest that changes of &gt;15% should be detectable in experiments of the sample size used here. Nevertheless there may be EFA-6-dependent and EFA-6-independent effects on MT dynamics immediately after injury. Changes in MT dynamics within seconds of axon injury have been studied in <i>Aplysia</i> neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Erez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Erez and Spira, 2008</a>), which display rapid local MT depolymerization followed by repolymerization over several minutes. <i>Drosophila</i> neurons also display acute and chronic alterations in MT dynamics after injury (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lu et al., 2015</a>). Recent in vivo imaging of mammalian axons found an acute increase in axonal MT dynamics after laser axotomy, followed by a sustained increase over several days (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kleele et al., 2014</a>).

For puncta number (or peak #) analysis, we counted any peak with intensity greater than the mean +1 SD as a punctum.

A small ROI (region of interest) was drawn to cover one punctum of GFP::PTRN-1. Average intensity of mKate2 (EFA-6N150) within the ROI was measured as F(in). The ROI was then duplicated to cover a small region in the axon with no GFP::PTRN-1 puncta, and average intensity of mKate2 (EFA-6N150) within this ROI was measured as F(out).

Briefly, we obtained Cas9-sgRNA plasmid from the Goldstein lab and inserted an sgRNA sequence targeting <i>efa-6</i> into the vector using Quikchange mutagenesis. The two sgRNA sequences were GGCGAGGGGCTCCATCAATGG and GATGCAACTGTGGTACCTGG, targeting <i>efa-6</i> exon 1 and exon 2 respectively. 50 ng/\u03bcl of each Cas9-sgRNA plasmid and 20 ng/\u03bcl P<i>sur-5</i>-mCherry were co-injected into wild type animals. From 15 F<sub>1</sub> progeny we found one animal heterozygous for <i>efa-6(ju1200)</i>, which deletes 500 bp of exon 1, intron 1, and exon 2, and has a 26 bp insertion. mRNAs produced in <i>efa-6(ju1200)</i> encode polypeptides with a premature stop codon after amino acid 15, eliminating the 18 aa motif and the rest of EFA-6."

This is a massive and detailed manuscript that makes a significant contribution to our understanding of neuronal cell biology following axon injury. Chen et al. examine this topic in the model <i>C. elegans</i> using a combination of genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry. In a previous publication, the authors, through a genetic screen, identified a role for the Arf GEF EFA-6 in inhibiting the regrowth of <i>C. elegans</i> axons following injury by laser axotomy. EFA-6 had previously been shown by the Bowerman lab to inhibit microtubule growth at the cortex of <i>C. elegans</i> embryos through a novel domain in the N-terminus of the protein; however, neither the paper from the Bowerman lab nor from the previous authors had addressed the underlying molecular mechanism. This current manuscript proposes such a molecular mechanism."

They show that EFA-6 inhibits the number of growing MT plus ends along axons under basal conditions, and that injury can further depress the number of growing MT plus ends via a process that requires, in part, EFA-6. They show that the N-terminal motif described initially in the Bowerman paper binds directly to two conserved MT-associated proteins: TAC-1 (TACC) and ZYG-8 (DCLK). They find that TAC-1 and ZYG-8 are both required for axon regrowth following injury, as well as for the overgrowth phenotype observed when <i>efa-6</i> is knocked out. In addition, they show that ZYG-8 is required for EFA-6 to regulate the number of growing MT plus ends. They also show that injury promotes the colocalization of TAC-1 with EFA-6 to MT minus ends in response to injury, although it appears that the two proteins do not regulate each other's subcellular localization. The authors do not show that the subcellular localization of either EFA-6 or TAC-1 to MT minus ends is required for axon regrowth; however, they do show that the Patronin homolog PTRN-1, which normally stabilizes MT minus ends, is required for regrowth, so a role for EFA-6 and/or TAC-1 at the MT minus ends certainly remains a possibility. Taken together, the authors' data suggest that injury triggers acute MT plus end catastrophe through the inhibition of ZYG-8 by EFA-6, followed by a slower MT plus end rescue and regeneration that is dependent on both ZYG-8 and TAC-1, and that these MT dynamics are required for proper axonal regrowth."
