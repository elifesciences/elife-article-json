Disruptions in cortico-cortical connectivity have been suggested as a primary mechanism of unconsciousness. By using a novel combination of positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied anesthesia-induced unconsciousness and recovery using the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-agonist dexmedetomidine. During unconsciousness, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and cerebral blood flow were preferentially decreased in the thalamus, the Default Mode Network (DMN), and the bilateral Frontoparietal Networks (FPNs). Cortico-cortical functional connectivity within the DMN and FPNs was preserved. However, DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity was disrupted. Recovery from this state was associated with sustained reduction in cerebral blood flow and restored DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. We report that loss of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is sufficient to produce unconsciousness."

Disruptions in cortico-cortical connectivity have been suggested as a primary mechanism of unconsciousness. By using a novel combination of positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied anesthesia-induced unconsciousness and recovery using the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-agonist dexmedetomidine. During unconsciousness, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and cerebral blood flow were preferentially decreased in the thalamus, the Default Mode Network (DMN), and the bilateral Frontoparietal Networks (FPNs). Cortico-cortical functional connectivity within the DMN and FPNs was preserved. However, DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity was disrupted. Recovery from this state was associated with sustained reduction in cerebral blood flow and restored DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. We report that loss of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is sufficient to produce unconsciousness."

We then studied <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake during baseline and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness in these 10 healthy volunteers in a separate experiment where we defined loss of consciousness as the onset of sustained eye closure and lack of response to a verbal request to open the eyes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

                                "text": "Given that we observed reduced flow and metabolism in regions known to correspond to the DMN and FPNs (<a href=\"#bib63\">Raichle et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Vincent et al., 2008</a>), we next asked whether intrinsic functional connectivity within these networks was altered with dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. First, we confirmed that during both wakefulness and unconsciousness, the DMN and bilateral FPNs were consistently identified in our volunteers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Next, we performed a comparison of changes in these networks between the unconscious and awake states. When we compared the DMN between these two states, we found no difference in functional connectivity between the cortical regions of the DMN and FPNs, suggesting that cortico\u2013cortico functional connectivity may be maintained during unconsciousness (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). However, we observed a reduction in functional connectivity between the thalamus and the DMN in the unconscious state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). This loss of thalamic functional connectivity was observed in a region consistent with intralaminar, midline, mediodorsal, and ventral anterior nuclei. However, our ability to precisely resolve the thalamic nuclei implicated in loss of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is limited because our methods are not sensitive to small focal differences. We also found that functional connectivity of the left cerebellar representation of the DMN (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buckner et al., 2011</a>) was significantly reduced during unconsciousness (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). When we compared the FPNs in these two states, we found that the left and right FPNs showed opposite changes in functional connectivity with a cerebellar cluster, likely indicating a switch in hemispheric dominance for cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity to this region during unconsciousness (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>, <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Functional connectivity of the cerebellar representations of the FPNs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buckner et al., 2011</a>) was also significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>, <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>, <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Since cortico-cerebellar connections are mediated by the thalamus (<a href=\"#bib31\">Guillery and Sherman, 2002</a>), the changes we observed in cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity are likely related to impaired thalamic functioning. Taken together, these results show that unconsciousness is associated with decreased thalamic CMR<sub>glc</sub>, rCBF, and functional connectivity to the DMN and support the notion that the thalamus plays a critical role in mediating unconsciousness."

We identified 10 volunteers who responded to verbal instructions (opened eyes and gave a thumbs-up signal, though they were still mildly sedated) during at least 6 min of the recovery ASL scan. Surprisingly, when we compared the recovery state to the unconscious state in these volunteers, we found that the rCBF did not increase (cluster corrected, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In fact, when explored at a more liberal threshold (uncorrected, p &lt; 0.05), further decreases in rCBF were observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). When we compared the recovery state to the awake state, we found that the decrease in rCBF showed a spatial distribution similar to that observed during the unconscious state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Next, we aligned all subjects to unconscious and recovery time points in order to study the dynamics of rCBF changes within the statistically significant clusters. We confirmed that rCBF decreased during loss of consciousness and that this decrease was maintained during recovery from this state in all regions analyzed (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that cortical rCBF increase was not sufficient for the early stages of recovery from unconsciousness induced by dexmedetomidine."

Likewise, in-depth electrode studies in humans show that changes in thalamic activity during sleep precedes changes in cortical activity, suggesting that disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity may underlie changes in consciousness (<a href=\"#bib49\">Magnin et al., 2010</a>). Also, during propofol anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, decreases in thalamo-cortical functional connectivity, alongside disruptions in cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the DMN and FPNs, have been described in healthy volunteers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boveroux et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ni Mhuircheartaigh et al., 2013</a>) Functional reintegration of the thalamus to key regions of the cortex appears to be necessary for the recovery of consciousness from this state (<a href=\"#bib41\">Langsjo et al., 2012</a>)."

Our results show that these connections may comprise a functional circuit that is disrupted during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. Moreover, this functional circuit appears specifically to involve the posterior cingulate cortex, distinct from anterior or mid-cingulate cortex. In our thalamic seed-based functional connectivity analysis, we found that during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, thalamic regions consistent with intralaminar, midline, mediodorsal, and ventral anterior nuclei were functionally disconnected from posterior DMN structures (precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex). Perhaps more importantly, recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness was associated with restored thalamo-thalamic and thalamic functional connectivity to the posterior cingulate cortex. Structural connectivity between the thalamus and the posterior cingulate cortex has also recently been correlated with the severity of DOC and used to subcategorize patients in minimally conscious states (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fernandez-Espejo et al., 2012</a>). The above observations lead us to conclude that a noradrenergic circuit involving the thalamus and posterior cingulate cortex may be important for recovery from both dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness and DOC states."

We note that our observed reduction in blood flow in the precuneus and thalamus during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness parallels this result. However, during recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, we did not observe an increase in rCBF to any brain regions. Since our current and previously reported (<a href=\"#bib18\">Drummond et al., 2008</a>) results suggest that dexmedetomidine does not decouple rCBF and CMRglc, we surmise that metabolism does not return to baseline during the earliest phases of recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. Thus, the reduced rCBF we report after recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness could reflect a residual drug effect state in which subjects are responsive to external stimuli but remain in a sedated state. This residual effect may be mediated by the broad and diffuse nor-adrenergic projections from the locus ceruleus to the rest of the brain (<a href=\"#bib72\">Vogt et al., 2008</a>)."

For example, performance on more complex cognitive tasks likely differs substantially between the awake and recovery states. This suggests that re-establishment of functional connectivity between vital brain regions precedes increases in rCBF and CMRglc. Return of rCBF and CMRglc to baseline levels may be indicative of the final stages of recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. Future investigations incorporating cognitive and psychomotor vigilance tasks during recovery from experimental models of unconsciousness would lend further insight on whether this is a drug-specific effect. Nevertheless, this finding is interesting because it suggests that recovery from unconsciousness states may proceed prior to significant increases in rCBF."

This debate has been fueled by clinical studies of anesthetized patients that have reported rare intraoperative episodes of awareness (resulting from light anesthetic depth) under anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ghoneim et al., 2009</a>) and dreaming under anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brandner et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Leslie et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Errando et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sanders et al., 2012</a>). Noreika et al. studied this phenomenon with dexmedetomidine, sevoflurane, propofol, and xenon (<a href=\"#bib60\">Noreika et al., 2011</a>) and confirmed that subjective experiences of consciousness occur during clinically defined unconsciousness states. However, the experimental paradigm that was used to test for subjective experiences of consciousness involved a gradual increase in drug concentrations. This empiric gradual increase did not directly target anesthetic drug dosing to a neurophysiologically defined brain state nor does it inform us on the amount of time that was spent in lighter levels of anesthesia. Thus, the reported subjective experiences could have occurred when the drug concentration levels were very low. This line of reasoning is supported by evidence confirming that subjective experiences of dreaming under general anesthesia likely occur when patients are emerging from general anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib44\">Leslie et al., 2009</a>)."

To a limited degree, they are also thought to occur during NREM sleep, especially at sleep onset in NREM I and during NREM II sleep periods encountered later at night (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hobson, 2009</a>). However, the current methods for scoring sleep states remain imprecise and highly subjective, with limited state and temporal resolution, and high intra- and inter-scorer variability, raising the possibility that clinically scored NREM I and II sleep may include periods of arousal. In clinical sleep scoring, trained technicians visually score the sleep time-series data in 30-s epochs according to semantically defined sleep stages. These scoring standards grossly simplify sleep electroencephalographic dynamics. For example, consider the characterization of sleep onset. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines sleep onset as the first appearance of any 30-s epoch that contains at least 15 s of sleep (<a href=\"#bib36\">Iber et al., 2007</a>). This implies that sleep onset is a binary process. However, recent EEG studies in humans clearly demonstrate that sleep onset, at both a neurophysiological and behavioral level, is a continuous process. As such, methods designed to track moment-to-moment continuous variations in the EEG are significantly better at predicting when subjects lose wakefulness, measured in terms of a behavioral task, than traditional sleep scoring methods (<a href=\"#bib62\">Prerau et al., 2014</a>). In particular, subjects can continue to perform awake behavior despite being scored as asleep (NREM I) using traditional sleep scoring methods. Thus, it is possible that the subjective experiences of consciousness that have been ascribed to NREM sleep could have occurred during subjectively scored sleep stages that included un-scored periods of arousal or wakefulness."

We then applied a combination of fMRI and FDG-PET imaging that would characterize the overall time-integrated brain activity during this state. Clinical evidence shows that motor-evoked potentials, and thus motor function from cortex down, remain intact in this state, making it unlikely that the loss of responsiveness we observed is only a result of disrupted motor function (<a href=\"#bib55\">Moore et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Garavaglia et al., 2014</a>).

Our results, in combination with previous work, resolve this conflict by showing how both mechanisms could co-exist but at different parts of the continuum of altered arousal or unconsciousness. Moreover, it suggests a mechanistic interpretation for varying levels of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, where disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity, but intact cortico-cortical functional connectivity reflects lighter states of unconsciousness and disruptions of both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity reflect deeper states of unconsciousness.

A complete metabolic panel and a urine pregnancy test were also obtained to confirm that all values were within normal ranges and to confirm non-pregnant status, respectively. A total of 20 subjects participated in screening visits and 18 subjects were deemed eligible to participate in the study protocol. Two subjects were deemed ineligible after medical evaluation and one subject was lost to follow-up after providing informed consent. During all study visits, subjects were required to take nothing by mouth for at least 8 hr. A urine toxicology screen was performed to ensure that subjects had not taken drugs that might confound interpretation of the results.

This longer acquisition was performed in order to ensure that perfusion data were collected for a long enough period to capture the transition from the awake to the unconscious state. During the infusion period, the study anesthesiologists monitored cuff blood pressure, capnography, electrocardiogram, and pulse-oximetry. Volunteers were instructed to keep their eyes open during the course of the study; loss of consciousness was defined as the onset of sustained eye closure and lack of response to a verbal request to open the eyes. After the onset of unconsciousness, we then performed a 6:15 min \u2018unconscious\u2019 BOLD fMRI scan (to evaluate unconsciousness-related changes in functional connectivity). After acquisition of all images, the dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued, and a 20:08 min pASL scan was performed to assess changes in rCBF upon recovery. Spontaneous eye opening and a positive response to give a thumbs-up signal were used to determine recovery of consciousness. All 10 subjects who experienced spontaneous eye opening during the final 6:08 min of the recovery of consciousness pASL successfully executed on the thumbs-up signal request. An additional 6:15 min \u2018recovery\u2019 BOLD fMRI scan was performed, in order to assess variations in functional connectivity upon recovery."

Datasets were slice-timing corrected (SLICETIMER), motion-corrected (MCFLIRT), brain-extracted (BET), registered to MPRAGE (BBREGISTER) and then to the MNI152 atlas (FNIRT), smoothed with a 5 mm FMWH kernel and high-pass filtered (cutoff = 0.008 Hz). As ASL and PET analyses revealed that unconsciousness was associated with a reduction in glucose metabolism and rCBF in regions belonging to distinct resting-state networks (Default Mode and both Frontoparietal Control networks; DMN, FCN), we assessed how intrinsic functional connectivity of these specific networks was affected by unconsciousness, using the dual regression approach (<a href=\"#bib23\">Filippini et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zuo et al., 2010</a>). All the preprocessed datasets were concatenated to create a single 4D dataset. A probabilistic Independent Component Analysis (pICA) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beckmann et al., 2005</a>) was performed using Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) on this concatenated 4D dataset, limiting the number of independent components (ICs) to 25, as in previous publications using the dual regression approach (<a href=\"#bib23\">Filippini et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Napadow et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Loggia et al., 2013</a>). From the pool of the 25 ICs, the DMN, right and left FCNs were clearly identified. Group-level spatial maps for each of these RSNs were used as a set of spatial regressors in a General Linear Model (GLM), in order to identify the individual subjects' time course associated with each group-level map. These time courses were then variance normalized and used as a set of temporal regressors in a GLM, to find subject-specific maps associated with the different group-level independent components. In this GLM, explanatory variables also included six motion parameters and the time courses from ventricles and white matter as covariates of no interest. Subject-specific maps were compared across states (awake, unconscious, recovery) using paired t-tests. As our dual regression ICA approach identified altered DMN functional connectivity to the thalamus, we used this thalamic region as a seed for seed-based functional connectivity analysis. This follow-up analysis was done with the purpose of (1) determining whether specific portions of the DMN (e.g., more posterior regions within the network) may be responsible for driving the effect and (2) assessing changes in functional connectivity between the thalamus and other, non-DMN regions. The extracted fMRI time series, variance normalized, was used as a regressor in a GLM for the awake, unconscious, and recovery data. The same nuisance regressors adopted in the dual regression analyses (see above), with the addition of global signal time course were used in the seed-based analyses. Statistical parametric maps were thresholded using clusters determined by a voxel-wise threshold (Z &gt; 2.3) and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of p = 0.05 (<a href=\"#bib78\">Worsley, 2001</a>). From representative clusters identified in the various analyses, data were extracted and displayed for illustrative purposes. Human brain atlases were used for anatomical reference of the cerebrum (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mai et al., 2008</a>) and the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib17\">Diedrichsen et al., 2009</a>)."

Without studying the volunteers' subjective experience (after the period of sedation) they would be hard-pressed to describe what was studied as loss of consciousness. <a href=\"#bib60\">Noreika et al. (2011)</a> showed that almost 3 of 4 of their subjects with dexmedetomidine-induced unresponsiveness reported a subjective experience. Absent documentation of presence/absence of subjective experience and therefore presence/absence of consciousness, the possibility remains that most of the subjects retained consciousness and hence cortico\u2013cortico connectivity. A further doubt whether the subjects had lost consciousness is their description of the similarity of the dexmedetomidine-induced behavioral state to EEG-defined stage 2 NREM sleep; this sleep state is not uniformly associated with a lack of subjective experience and therefore unconsciousness."

The cerebellum has been traditionally thought to solely contribute to planning and execution of movement, however recent research now demonstrates that the cerebellum is also involved in higher-order neural processing and cognition (Buckner, Neuron 2013 October 30;80(3):807-15). Indeed, the cerebellar regions displaying alterations in connectivity during dexmedetomidine-induced anesthesia in our study did not correspond to the cerebellar representation of the sensorimotor network. Rather they correspond to regions previously described as the cerebellar components of Default Mode Network and the Fronto-parietal networks (Buckner et al., J Neurophysiology 2011 November;106(5):2322-45), which are involved in cognitive processes (including self-referential cognition and attention processes) as opposed to motor processes. At our institution, dexmedetomidine is preferentially used for craniotomies involving cortical motor mapping (masses abutting the motor cortex) due to its favorable \u201carousability to consciousness\u201d profile. We have not found that dexmedetomidine impairs motor output/motor-evoked potentials (Garavaglia et al., J Neurosurg Anesthesiol. 2014 July;26(3):226-33; Moore et al., Anesth Analg. 2006 May;102(5):1556-8)."

This method of investigation does not precisely inform us on the timing of the subjective experience (anesthesia induction vs surgical anesthesia level maintenance vs anesthesia emergence). Nor does it inform us about the timing of that subjective experience relative to the subject\u2019s brain state, which can fluctuate substantially even at a \u201csteady state\u201d of anesthetic administration, and certainly during induction and emergence. In particular, these studies were not performed with an a priori or post hoc analysis of the neurophysiological state(s) elicited by the general anesthetic agent. Rather, the Bispectral Index was typically used as a crude measure of the anesthetized brain. Research and clinical experience from our group and others indicate that the Bispectral Index output varies substantially from clinical assessments of unconsciousness. This is because the output from this device attempts to simplify the complex nature of the electroencephalogram to a single number between 1 and 100. To better inform the readers and to foster more principled approaches to defining and studying unconsciousness/lack of responsiveness in neuroscience, in the revised version of this manuscript, we now describe a few nuances pertaining to anesthesia- and sleep-induced unconsciousness in the context of the subjective experience(s) that have been elicited and positioned to argue against unconsciousness in these states (section titled \u201cSubjective awareness during sleep and anesthesia\u201d)."

The technology lacks the temporal resolution to capture physiological alterations associated with faster brain dynamics such as dexmedetomidine-induced brain changes in glucose utilization. Therefore, changes in glucose utilization induced by experimental paradigms such as ours are typically inferred by comparing two separate scans (baseline vs active study scan). While ASL and BOLD fMRI have a faster temporal resolution at the level of several seconds, the SNR of these methods requires pooling of information across many minutes of imaging (in essence, averaging). Therefore, contemporary analyses of fMRI data are almost always limited to static analyses (brain maps) obtained over a several-minute period. Thus, unfortunately, it is not possible to study detailed time-varying activity with any of these imaging modalities."

The FWHM of the PET camera used in our study -the Siemens Biograph mMR- is 4.3 mm measured at 1 cm from the center of the field of view (Delso et al., J Nucl Med 2011). Therefore, it follows that only objects with a diameter larger than &gt;1 cm would be fully resolved.
