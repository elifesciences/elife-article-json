To resolve structure\u2013function relationships, we juxtacellularly recorded and labeled single GCs in freely moving rats. We found that the vast majority of neurons were silent during exploration. Most active GCs displayed a characteristic spike waveform, fired at low rates and showed spatial activity. Primary dendritic parameters were sufficient for classifying neurons as active or silent with high accuracy. Our data thus support a sparse coding scheme in the dentate gyrus and provide a possible link between structural and functional heterogeneity among the GC population."

To resolve structure\u2013function relationships, we juxtacellularly recorded and labeled single GCs in freely moving rats. We found that the vast majority of neurons were silent during exploration. Most active GCs displayed a characteristic spike waveform, fired at low rates and showed spatial activity. Primary dendritic parameters were sufficient for classifying neurons as active or silent with high accuracy. Our data thus support a sparse coding scheme in the dentate gyrus and provide a possible link between structural and functional heterogeneity among the GC population."

In neocortical circuits, sparse representations are thought to be crucial for optimal encoding of sensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brecht et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huber et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rochefort et al., 2009</a>). Similarly in hippocampal circuits, the skewed distribution of population firing activity indicates that a preconfigured, highly active minority of neurons dominates information coding (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mizuseki and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buzsaki and Mizuseki, 2014</a>). Whether and how this highly active population is structurally or molecularly different from the majority of neurons remains to be established. The dentate gyrus (DG) is among the most sparse networks known to date. Extracellular recordings in foraging rodents have in fact revealed that only a tiny minority of principal neurons \u2013 putative granule cells (GCs) \u2013 is active during behavior, while the rest are silent (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jung and McNaughton, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Skaggs et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</a>).

An advantage of this technique over conventional extracellular methods is that neurons can be identified irrespective of their spiking activity; thus, both silent and active cells can be sampled during free behavior (i.e. under intact sensory, motor and vestibular inputs), which enables the analysis of sparsely active networks (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hrom\u00e1dka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Herfst et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burgalossi et al., 2014</a>).

To this end, we juxtacellularly recorded and labeled spontaneously active neurons in the rat DG in-vivo. From these recordings, we observed that active GCs displayed a characteristic spike waveform, as shown in the representative example in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>. Here, a spontaneously active GC was recorded and identified in a head-fixed awake rat. This neuron displayed morphological features of mature GCs (see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and discharged sparsely during the awake state (average firing rate=0.49\u2009Hz; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Notably, spikes from this neuron displayed a \u2018shoulder\u2019 following the positive peak of the juxtacellular spike, which was best evident as a local maximum in the first derivative of the juxtacellular voltage trace (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Altogether, we recorded and identified 47 active neurons during urethane theta-oscillations (n=19), awake head-fixation (n=4) and free-behavior (n=24) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In these recordings, the presence of spike-shoulders was determined by the intersection between the spike trace and its moving average during the repolarization phase of the spike (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Irrespective of the recording condition (i.e. anesthetized versus awake), we found that all neurons displaying spike-shoulders were located within the GC layer (n=17; with the exception of one excitatory neuron just below the GC layer; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>\u00a0and Materials and methods) and corresponded to morphologically mature GCs (see criteria in Materials and methods; n=15 cases where morphology could be assessed). In CA3c (n=7), fast-spiking (n=10) and hilar (n=17) neurons, spike-shoulders were not identified (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In most cases spike-shoulders from GCs were already apparent in the average spike waveform (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and resulted in a relatively long duration of the juxtacellular spike signal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Furthermore, recordings could be assigned with high accuracy to the GC class based solely on the average spike waveforms (~89%; cross-validated; see Materials and methods for details), thus providing additional evidence for a correlation between spike-shoulders and GC identity."

An example of a classified GC recording is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013K</a>. In this recording, cell identification by juxtacellular labeling failed, but the recording site could be localized to the GC layer (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). This neuron fired only a few spikes during behavior, which tended to cluster at a single spatial location (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). Spikes fired by this neuron displayed prominent shoulders (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>), a strong correlate of GC identity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Altogether, we recorded 27 active GCs (9 identified and 18 classified) during spatial exploration. We note that since most but not all identified active GCs displayed spike-shoulders (18 out of 21; ~86%, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), a fraction of GC recordings (~14%) is likely to be misclassified as false-negative in our dataset.

To this end, we first reconstructed the somato-dendritic compartment of seven silent and six active GCs (all of which were classified as morphologically\u00a0mature; see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and criteria in Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), which were selected for the morphological analysis on the basis of their high-quality filling (see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We then trained a logistic regression classifier enforcing different levels of sparsity in the weights with different primary morphological metrics (total dendritic length, total length of dendritic branch orders, number of primary dendrites and number of dendritic endings)\u00a0as features<a href=\"#fig4\">\u00a0(Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). The classifier was able to distinguish active and silent cells with good accuracy independent of the enforced level of sparsity (leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy ~85%, 11 out of 13 cells classified correctly). This classification accuracy was significantly higher than chance (p=0.03, permutation test, 500 runs, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). For lower levels of sparsity, the classifier used a more distributed weight profile, whereas for higher levels, the weight used was more concentrated on individual predictors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Overall, longer high-order dendrites (5 and 6\u00a0orders) were most predictive of active cells, whereas shorter low-order dendrites (2 and 3\u00a0orders) together with a higher number of primary dendrites were most predictive of silent cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Notably, the morphological differences between active and silent neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>) were unlikely to have resulted from methodological or procedural biases (see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for more details). This indicates that in our dataset of identified neurons (n=13), dendritic architectures can be predictive of GC activity during behavior (see also <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Here we show that indeed the large majority of juxtacellularly\u00a0sampled neurons within the GC layer are silent during exploration. The small fraction of active GCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) displayed characteristic juxtacellular spike waveforms, characterized by the presence of \u2018shoulders\u2019 following the positive action potential peak (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). Although, at present, we ignore the relative contributions of capacitive and/or ionic mechanisms to spike-shoulders, they served as a reliable correlate of GC identity. If such waveform signatures can also be resolved extracellularly \u2013 which remains to be demonstrated \u2013 they could be instrumental for future classification of tetrode-recorded DG units. We also provide direct anatomical evidence that morphologically\u00a0mature GCs can display spatial firing, which in most cases occurred at single spatial locations (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although this is consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib30\">Leutgeb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</a>), the limited recording durations and spatial sampling prevent rigorous comparison with previous extracellular studies. Recordings in large open-field environments will be required to\u00a0resolve whether different firing patterns (single versus multiple firing fields) are contributed by distinct cell types within the DG (<a href=\"#bib37\">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</a>)."

Briefly, animals were pre-implanted with a metal post and a recording chamber under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, and a craniotomy was performed at the coordinates for targeting the dorsal DG (3.5\u20134\u00a0mm posterior and 1.5\u20132\u00a0mm lateral from bregma). After a recovery period (~3\u20135 days), animals were slowly habituated to head-fixation. After successful habituation, and before juxtacellular recordings, mapping experiments with low resistance electrodes (0.5\u20131\u00a0M\u03a9) were performed to estimate the location of the DG\u00a0precisely. Electrode penetrations were adjusted in order to target the DG blades and the crest.

Implantation and mapping procedures were similar to those\u00a0described above for the head-fixed preparation. After recovery from the surgery, animals were slowly habituated to the head-fixation and to collect chocolate/food pellets, as recently described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diamantaki et al., 2016</a>).

In all silent recordings, the presence of a silent neuron was verified either by juxtacellular labeling (as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) or by the presence of \u2018end spikes\u2019 upon recording loss. Twenty-seven recordings were from active GCs (9 identified and 18 classified as putative GCs \u2013 these 27 recordings were equally distributed between the different types of arenas: 11 were performed in\u00a0two-dimensional arenas and 16 on the O-shaped circular maze). Eight recordings were from hilar neurons (seven identified and one putative), six from identified CA3c cells and four from fast-spiking cells (one identified and three putative)."

The category of fast-spiking neurons contained identified cells (n=2) and non-identified recordings (n=8), which were classified as fast-spiking on the basis of characteristic electrophysiological features (i.e. firing rates &gt; 10Hz and/or narrow spike widths, i.e. &lt; 0.2 ms spike half-widths). One neuron, located below the GC layer (asterisk in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) displayed spike-shoulders, but its morphology could not be assessed because only the soma was recovered; this neuron was, however, classified as a putative excitatory cell (positive for GluR2/3 expression; not shown) and, unlike mossy cells or displaced CA3c neurons, it\u00a0displayed a small soma (diameter=11 \u00b5m).

The neural-network classifier was created using the built-in functions of the MATLAB Neural Networks Toolbox. The hidden layer size was set to ten and training was stopped when more than\u00a0six validation errors occurred. To\u00a0train the neural-network classifier, the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation and a leave-one-out cross validation scheme was used. To balance the different class sizes, we used the ADASYN (adaptive synthetic sampling approach for imbalanced learning) algorithm. This algorithm creates new samples from the minority class using linear interpolation between existing minority class examples (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haibo et al., 2008</a>). GCs were correctly classified on the basis of spike-shape features with high accuracy (~89%) and\u00a0with a low rate of false-positives (2/47; ~4%) and false-negatives (3/47; ~6%). All neurons that\u00a0were\u00a0classified as \u2018putative\u2019 GCs (n=18) were correctly classified as GCs by the neural network classifier (see also 'Targeting of the dentate gyrus and dataset of juxtacellular recordings' above). High classification accuracy (~87%) was also obtained by training the classifier only on the repolarization phase of the average spikes (i.e. where shoulders occur), indicating that the presence/absence of spike-shoulders is a strong determinant of the classifier\u2019s performance. In line with the conclusions from the identified dataset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>), the classification results provide additional evidence for a correlation between spike-shoulders and GC identity."

Sixteen out of 27 GC recordings met these criteria, and were included in the spatial analysis. The generally low firing rates and total number of spikes prevented rigorous quantification of spatial modulation by statistical criteria; in line with observations from previous work (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jung and McNaughton, 1993</a>), we classified recordings as spatially\u00a0selective if the spikes were spatially clustered and the corresponding place fields accounted for &lt;\u00a020% of the total visited pixels. Spatial information content was calculated as in <a href=\"#bib5\">Bjerknes et al.\u00a0(2014</a>). To calculate the number of place fields, a firing field was defined from the rate map, and considered as at least 12 contiguous pixels with average firing rate exceeding 20% of the peak firing rate. The \u2018in-field firing rate\u2019 (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) was calculated as the average firing rate of the place field pixels, and the \u2018out-of-field firing rate\u2019 as the average firing rate of the pixels outside the place fields. In eight recordings, a single firing field could be observed (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), where\u00a0as in three cases, an additional field could be detected. In the remaining five recordings, firing was not spatially\u00a0selective.

Neuronal reconstructions were performed blind to the electrophysiological properties of the cells. For cell id 993, the soma was occluded by a black deposit on the brain section, and its position was manually interpolated at the termination point of the primary dendrite. Close-up magnifications of the soma and proximal dendrites in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> have,\u00a0in a few cases, been rotated along the longitudinal axis to\u00a0allow\u00a0optimal display of the primary dendrites. The quality of cellular filling and labeling was estimated by quantifying the gray levels of DAB-stained neurons with ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>). For all identified neurons (n=13; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), high-magnification pictures (100x oil-immersion objective) were obtained under identical settings (e.g. illumination and camera exposure) with a light microscope (BX-53, Olympus). A region of interest was defined on proximal and distal dendrites, and the normalized gray scale values (max gray value \u2013 background level) were taken as a correlate of labeling intensities. All proximal dendritic segments were within 20 \u00b5m of the soma, while distal dendritic segments were \u2265\u00a0200 \u00b5m from the soma. We note that in both groups (active and silent) of reconstructed neurons, it cannot be assured whether -\u00a0even in the best-filled examples -\u00a0dendritic morphologies are full and complete.\u00a0Nevertheless, our analysis indicates that labeling quality and filling efficiency were very similar between active and silent neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a> and \u2018control experiments\u2019 below). Labeling efficiencies for silent and active neurons were estimated as the proportion of filled neurons (n=6 active and n=7 silent neurons; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) over all labeling attempts. Dendritic lengths were not compensated by tissue shrinkage. Dendritic order (n<sup>th</sup>) was defined as the portion of the dendritic tree between the (n\u22121) and (n) branching nodes, or the dendritic end. The only exception was the first-order dendrites, which were estimated as the distance between the soma center and the first branching node. We found this measure to be more consistent across repeated measurements and experimenters, whereas the distance from the soma edge\u00a0to the first branching node is more dependent on the shape (more or less elongated) of the somatic contour. Estimating primary dendritic length as the distance between the soma edge and the first branching node (see dendritic segments in \u2018blue\u2019 in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) did not affect classification accuracy (not shown). The \u2018soma location\u2019 within the GC layer (see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) was estimated as the relative position with respect to the anatomical borders of the GC layer, with \u20180\u2019 representing the deep border \u2013 close to the hilus \u2013 and \u20181\u2019 the superficial border \u2013 close to the molecular layer. The \u2018branching index\u2019 was defined as the number of dendritic endings divided by the number of primary dendrites.

To estimate the total number of spines (see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>), we quantified spine densities in GCs (n=7)\u00a0by manually counting the number of spines on 10 \u00b5m dendritic segments, and then\u00a0dividing it by the total segment length; at least three dendritic segments were counted per branch order, and averaged. Spine densities were within the range reported in the literature (<a href=\"#bib14\">Desmond and Levy, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hama et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Trommald and Hulleberg, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vuksic et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Freiman et al., 2011</a>); however, in the present study, densities were not compensated for hidden spines and\u00a0so\u00a0absolute values represent an underestimate. Since spine densities increased as a function of dendritic order (not shown; see also <a href=\"#bib52\">Stone et al. (2011</a>)), the total number of spines (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) was estimated as the sum, over all dendritic orders, of the spine densities multiplied by the total dendritic length of each order."

First, the efficiency of juxtacellular filling was very similar between active and silent neurons (active, 6/14 labeling attempts, ~42%; silent, 7/19 labeling attempts, ~37%). Second, no apparent bias was observed in the distribution of active and silent neurons across animals (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), and no correlation was observed between in-vivo activity and soma location within the GC layer or the laminar location of the cells (suprapyramidal versus infrapyramidal blade) (see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Third, the quality of cell filling and dendritic labeling was similar between active and silent neurons. This was assessed by comparing: (i) the staining intensity at distal dendritic locations (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>); and (ii) the distribution of dendritic endings as a function of distance from the soma (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). We reasoned that incompletely\u00a0filled neurons should display lower labeling intensities and dendritic endings that\u00a0are\u00a0located closer to the soma; these parameters (together with total dendritic lengths, see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) were not significantly different between active and silent neurons (see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>). Moreover, dendritic complexity was not correlated to the labeling/filling quality (p=0.32; n=13). Altogether,these\u00a0analyses\u00a0indicate that our identified neurons are likely to represent a random sample of active and silent GCs, and that labeling biases are unlikely to account for the differences in morphological parameters between the two classes."

In the outer cross-validation loop, we iterated over each individual cell, evaluating the prediction for that cell with a model trained on all but that cell (\u2018leave-one-out cross-validation\u2019). We used primary dendritic measures (the total dendritic length, the length of dendritic orders 1\u20137, the number of primary dendrites and the number of dendritic endings) as features (10 in total; see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

The evaluated model is selected on the basis of the the 1-SE rule to prevent overfitting (<a href=\"#bib20\">Friedman et al., 2010</a>). All variables were z-scored before training the classifier. We used the elastic-net algorithm with \u03b1=0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9 and 0.95, regularizing the weights with a mix of L2 and L1 regularization;\u00a0this\u00a0resulted in a denser weight vector for small values of \u03b1 and a sparse weight vector for high values. The elastic-net penalty is particularly well suited for coping with highly correlated predictors as is the case here (<a href=\"#bib20\">Friedman et al., 2010</a>). The choice of \u03b1 did not affect the classification performance (~85%). We used the implementation provided by lassoglm in MATLAB with a binomial output distribution. We report the mean weight with SEM across cross-validation runs. To test whether the classification performance is significantly different than chance, we performed a permutation test. To this end, we shuffled the labels of all cells and repeated the entire cross-validation and classification procedure to obtain a null distribution of classification performances (500 runs, only for \u03b1=0.1). The p-value for the classification performance on the actual data is computed as the fraction of runs resulting in a classification performance larger or equal to the one observed in the data.\u00a0Code for running this analysis is available with the paper (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source code 1</a>)."

Previous experiments have explored granule cell activity using tetrode-style recordings or maps of cFos expression. These methods have suggested that GC activity is sparse \u2013 in the sense that only a small subset of GCs are active in any one environment \u2013 but both methods are imperfect. Extracellular recordings are biased towards active cells and sample neurons with more membrane area more efficiently. Loose-seal recordings are unbiased in the sense that active and inactive neurons are recorded. The authors find ultra-sparse activity in GCs, providing the strongest evidence to data for sparse coding in the dentate gyrus. Loose-seal recordings in addition allow labeling and reconstruction of a subset of recorded neurons. This provides the additional insight that active neurons are larger and spiny. This is a nice and simple structure-function relationship. These findings of specific structure-function relationships within the (mature) dentate granule cell population are novel and very interesting, and would constitute a valuable contribution to the field."

What is the fraction of silent cells for which labeling was attempted whose dendritic tree was completely filled, and how does that compare to the fraction for active cells? If there was any difference in the rate of complete filling, could it be possible that there was a bias in the labeling method that could lead to an apparent difference in the level of branching or complexity? Is it possible, for example, that silent cells were harder to fill and more likely to have somewhat less complete dendritic fills, and thus more likely to appear to have less complex trees?"

The 'complexity index' was computed as in previous work (Pillai et al., 2012) according to the following equation: (sum of branch tip orders + number of branch tips) x (total dendritic length/total number of primary dendrites).\" These measures appear to be particularly sensitive to the number of primary dendrites as it appears in the denominator in both cases. Therefore, the authors should include in the table mentioned above, for each of the 13 neurons with complete dendritic trees, the firing rate in the arena, the branching and complexity values, the total dendritic length, the number of dendritic endings, and the number of primary dendrites. The authors write that there was a non-significant 2x difference in the number of primary dendrites \"(the number of primary dendrites (active, 1.1+/-0.4; silent, 2.2+/-1.1; p=0.08)\", but the branching index also differed by 2x \"(branching index; active, 14.6+/-4.6; silent, 7.8+/-4.7; p=0.026)\", though this difference was significant. This suggests that the number of dendritic endings is similar for both silent and active cells. Therefore, is it possible that the difference in the number of primary dendrites could be responsible for differences in activity, instead of the difference in spine number that they suggest as the cause? In comparison, the number of spines differed by a factor of 1.4x \"(total number of spines; active, 1802+/-353; silent, 1354+/-257; p=0.035)\" and they state \"The total number of dendritic spines also showed a significant correlation with firing rates (r=0.63; p=0.019; n=13)\".

In order to record from spiking GCs, silent recordings were routinely discarded by further advancing the electrode within the layer.\" Does this mean that their sample was biased toward more active cells? If so, they should clearly point this out when they state proportions of cells that were active. For instance, they state \"Active GCs were thus very sparse, consistent with previous estimates (Jung and McNaughton, 1993; Leutgeb et al., 2007; Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012) and accounted for only ~14% (32 out of 228) of all blindly-sampled neurons within the GC layer.\" If they biased their search for active cells, then they should remove \"blindly-sampled\" from this sentence and point out that the 14% value is an overestimate based on their sampling method. In addition, is it possible that any bias in the search toward active cells could influence the morphological results? For instance, is it possible that cells that are active during the search and active during exploration of the arena are not a random sample of the entire set of cells active during exploration? Perhaps these cells have more branching and complex dendritic trees compared to cells that are active during exploration but were not spontaneously active during the cell search procedure? The basic question is whether the sample of 7 silent and 6 active cells analyzed in detail morphologically constituted an unbiased sample of silent cells, and an unbiased sample of active cells, respectively. If the possibility of such a bias cannot be ruled out, yet there is no reason to think there is a bias, the authors could just make a short comment about how they assume their methods have isolated a random sample of silent and active cells."

Each red circle represents one neuron, sampled juxtacellularly within the GC layer (see Methods for details). Note the large proportion of silent neurons (163 out of 190) compared to active cells.\" However, as acknowledged by the authors, their sampling of the proportion of active and silent cells is likely to be biased due to their search procedure, where inactive cells were often discarded early during exploration, before the 60-second threshold they used for counting the cells. Because of this, I think this statement and the numbers could confuse the readers into thinking that these numbers are an unbiased estimate, and one that is a better estimate than obtained with other methods. It would be a better estimate if their cell search / counting procedure was unbiased, but apparently it was not. The correct proportion is an important number. The authors should therefore clarify this in the legend as they have done in the main text. For example, they could write in the legend \"Note the large proportion of silent neurons (163 out of 190) compared to active cells. Furthermore, this proportion is likely to be an underestimate of the true silent proportion due to the details of the search procedure (see text and methods).\""

To address this comment rigorously, we have now quantified and compared the labeling/filling quality between active and silent neurons. This was done by 3 approaches: first, we compared the efficiencies of juxtacellular labeling. As specified in the revised Results, the same labeling procedures were applied to silent and active neurons, which resulted in similar efficiencies of dendritic filling (active, 6/14 labeling attempts, ~42%; silent, 7/19 labeling attempts, ~37%; p=1). Second, we quantified labeling/filling quality by measuring the gray levels of proximal and distal dendritic compartments in active and silent neurons. Incomplete filling typically results in weaker staining intensities, which tend to become weaker as a function of distance from the soma (a \u2018fading-off\u2019 profile). We found that both gray values at distal dendritic compartments and distal versus proximal intensity ratios were not significantly different between active and silent neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B, C</a>). Moreover, no significant correlation was found between the labeling intensities and dendritic complexity (p = 0.32). Third, we compared the distribution of dendritic endings as a function of distance from the soma. We reasoned that incompletely- filled neurons should display dendritic endings located closer to the soma; this distribution (together with total dendritic lengths, see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) was not significantly different between active and silent neurons (see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>).

The 'complexity index' was computed as in previous work (Pillai et al., 2012) according to the following equation: (sum of branch tip orders + number of branch tips) x (total dendritic length/total number of primary dendrites).\" These measures appear to be particularly sensitive to the number of primary dendrites as it appears in the denominator in both cases. Therefore, the authors should include in the table mentioned above, for each of the 13 neurons with complete dendritic trees, the firing rate in the arena, the branching and complexity values, the total dendritic length, the number of dendritic endings, and the number of primary dendrites. The authors write that there was a non-significant 2x difference in the number of primary dendrites \"(the number of primary dendrites (active, 1.1+/-0.4; silent, 2.2+/-1.1; p=0.08)\", but the branching index also differed by 2x \"(branching index; active, 14.6+/-4.6; silent, 7.8+/-4.7; p=0.026)\", though this difference was significant. This suggests that the number of dendritic endings is similar for both silent and active cells. Therefore, is it possible that the difference in the number of primary dendrites could be responsible for differences in activity, instead of the difference in spine number that they suggest as the cause? In comparison, the number of spines differed by a factor of 1.4x \"(total number of spines; active, 1802+/-353; silent, 1354+/-257; p=0.035)\" and they state \"The total number of dendritic spines also showed a significant correlation with firing rates (r=0.63; p=0.019; n=13)\". What is the correlation between the number of primary dendrites and firing rate and associated significance?</i>"

Whether this difference per se can translate (and account for) the differences in firing activities cannot be determined in our dataset, as we do not find a significant correlation between the number of primary dendrites and in-vivo activity (r=-0.49; p=0.089; now reported in the revised Results) Additional work will be required to determine whether integrative processes, which more critically depend on the number of primary dendrites and dendritic branch architecture (e.g. Xu et al., 2012; Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015) correlate with somatic spiking."

In our view, this appears as the most parsimonious interpretation of our data, also in light of previous work, where a relationship between dendritic architecture, spine density and activity has been proposed (e.g. Washington et al., 2000; Krichmar et al., 2002; Oberlaender et al., 2012; Roy et al., 2016).

In order to record from spiking GCs, silent recordings were routinely discarded by further advancing the electrode within the layer.\" Does this mean that their sample was biased toward more active cells? If so, they should clearly point this out when they state proportions of cells that were active. For instance, they state \"Active GCs were thus very sparse, consistent with previous estimates (Jung and McNaughton, 1993; Leutgeb et al., 2007; Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012) and accounted for only ~14% (32 out of 228) of all blindly-sampled neurons within the GC layer.\" If they biased their search for active cells, then they should remove \"blindly-sampled\" from this sentence and point out that the 14% value is an overestimate based on their sampling method. In addition, is it possible that any bias in the search toward active cells could influence the morphological results? For instance, is it possible that cells that are active during the search and active during exploration of the arena are not a random sample of the entire set of cells active during exploration? Perhaps these cells have more branching and complex dendritic trees compared to cells that are active during exploration but were not spontaneously active during the cell search procedure? The basic question is whether the sample of 7 silent and 6 active cells analyzed in detail morphologically constituted an unbiased sample of silent cells, and an unbiased sample of active cells, respectively. If the possibility of such a bias cannot be ruled out, yet there is no reason to think there is a bias, the authors could just make a short comment about how they assume their methods have isolated a random sample of silent and active cells.</i>"

With the so-called \u201celastic-net penalty\u201d (enforcing different levels of sparsity in the weights) this classifier is very well suited to cope with correlated features (Friedman et al., 2010). The cross-validation procedure entails that a classifier is trained on all but one cell and tested on that held-out cell, to avoid reporting an overly optimistic estimate of the classification performance. The classifier was able to discriminate silent and active cells in up to 85-92% of the cases, depending on the level of sparseness enforced (11-12 out of 13 cells classified correctly). To assess whether this could have occurred by chance we ran a permutation test, shuffling the cell type labels and rerunning the classification analysis (500 runs).

Each red circle represents one neuron, sampled juxtacellularly within the GC layer (see Methods for details). Note the large proportion of silent neurons (163 out of 190) compared to active cells.\" However, as acknowledged by the authors, their sampling of the proportion of active and silent cells is likely to be biased due to their search procedure, where inactive cells were often discarded early during exploration, before the 60-second threshold they used for counting the cells. Because of this, I think this statement and the numbers could confuse the readers into thinking that these numbers are an unbiased estimate, and one that is a better estimate than obtained with other methods. It would be a better estimate if their cell search / counting procedure was unbiased, but apparently it was not. The correct proportion is an important number. The authors should therefore clarify this in the legend as they have done in the main text. For example, they could write in the legend \"Note the large proportion of silent neurons (163 out of 190) compared to active cells. Furthermore, this proportion is likely to be an underestimate of the true silent proportion due to the details of the search procedure (see text and Methods).\"</i>"

We think this is primarily a result of (i) how primary dendrites are defined and (ii) the fact that our reconstructions were not compensated for tissue shrinkage. In the previous version of the manuscript, \u2018primary (or 1<sub>st</sub> order) dendrites\u2019 were defined as the distance between the soma edge and the first dendritic branching node. GCs with only one primary dendrite often display an elongated soma, which makes it difficult to determine the exact border between the somatic and the primary dendritic compartment. This is schematically shown as <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 2B</a>. Depending on the soma contour, this measure can jitter (from 3.3 to 5.9 \u00b5m in the representative example; cell id 103). In the previous version of the manuscript, we had used the shortest measurement across all cells. We note that the same definition and criteria were applied to both active and silent neurons (cells with short primary dendrites are present in both classes; active, cell ids 83, 103, 104, 1046; silent, cell ids 924, 949, 993) and hence unlikely to have biased our results."

A close-up magnification on the primary dendrites for all neurons is now shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>.

This is an important point, which we sought to address with additional analysis. To this end, we simulated an \u2018extreme\u2019 scenario, and removed the first branching node from all neurons with short primary dendrites (same cell ids as in point 2 above). This introduced a shift in dendritic orders, e.g. former 5<sub>th</sub> order became 4<sub>th</sub> order, and so forth; as pointed out by the Reviewer. Classification accuracy was however largely unaffected, and was only slightly worse for low enforced sparseness (76-85% classification accuracy as a function of enforced sparseness levels). We take this result as an indication that the morphological differences between active and silent cells are largely unaffected by the definition of primary dendrites, but rather reflect a more general difference in dendritic architectures. We note however that \u2013 in line with the reviewers\u2019 comment above \u2013 these differences are subtle, as they cannot be narrowed down to a single morphological parameter (now stated in the revised Discussion)."
