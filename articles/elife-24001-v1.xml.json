The consequent Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> 'misediting paradox' is resolved by EF-Tu in the cell. Here, we show that DTD\u2019s active site architecture can efficiently edit mischarged Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> species four orders of magnitude more efficiently than even AlaRS, the only ubiquitous cellular checkpoint known for clearing the error. Also, DTD knockout in AlaRS editing-defective background causes pronounced toxicity in <i>Escherichia coli</i> even at low glycine levels which is alleviated by alanine supplementation. We further demonstrate that DTD positively selects the universally invariant tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>-specific G3\u2022U70. Moreover, DTD\u2019s activity on non-cognate Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> is conserved across all bacteria and eukaryotes, suggesting DTD\u2019s key cellular role as a glycine deacylator. Our study thus reveals a hitherto unknown function of DTD in cracking the universal mechanistic dilemma encountered by AlaRS, and its physiological importance."
