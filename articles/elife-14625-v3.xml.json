Here, we directly estimated the spontaneous mutation rate by sequencing new <i>Drosophila</i> mutation accumulation lines maintained with minimal natural selection. We inferred strong stabilizing natural selection on quantitative traits because genetic variation among wild-derived inbred lines was much lower than predicted from a neutral model and the mutational effects were much larger than allelic effects of standing polymorphisms. Stabilizing selection could act directly on the traits, or indirectly from pleiotropic effects on fitness. However, our data are not consistent with simple models of mutation-stabilizing selection balance; therefore, further empirical work is needed to assess the balance of evolutionary forces responsible for quantitative genetic variation."

Here, we directly estimated the spontaneous mutation rate by sequencing new <i>Drosophila</i> mutation accumulation lines maintained with minimal natural selection. We inferred strong stabilizing natural selection on quantitative traits because genetic variation among wild-derived inbred lines was much lower than predicted from a neutral model and the mutational effects were much larger than allelic effects of standing polymorphisms. Stabilizing selection could act directly on the traits, or indirectly from pleiotropic effects on fitness. However, our data are not consistent with simple models of mutation-stabilizing selection balance; therefore, further empirical work is needed to assess the balance of evolutionary forces responsible for quantitative genetic variation."

In natural populations of finite size, however, mutations and the genetic variation they introduce are constantly removed by genetic drift and by purifying and stabilizing natural selection. Therefore, to understand how genetic variation is generated and maintained, one must know the rate by which spontaneous mutations occur and their effects on fitness and quantitative traits, and the forms and consequences of natural selection on genetic variation. To answer these fundamental questions, we take advantage of mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> derived from a single inbred genome and independently maintained under conditions of minimal natural selection, as well as a panel of wild-derived inbred lines representing a balanced state of mutations, drift and natural selection. The expectation is that MA lines are experiencing severe genetic bottlenecks thus have minimal natural selection. Therefore, unless a mutation is highly deleterious or lethal, its fate is determined primarily by genetic drift. This property of MA lines is distinctly different from natural populations and allows us to derive the expectation of genetic variation under neutrality using the estimated mutational variance among the MA lines. By comparing the expectation under neutrality to the observed level of genetic variation in a natural population, one can infer the form and consequences of natural selection on genetic variation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

We detected a total of 1,456 mutations that were either fixed or segregating at high frequency (&gt;0.20) on the euchromatic nuclear genome in the MA lines. The number of mutations per MA line ranged from 35 to 193, with a mean of 63 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). To validate mutations detected by Illumina\u2019s sequence-by-synthesis chemistry, we sequenced a randomly selected set of 51 mutations in five MA lines at generation 130 by capillary sequencing (Sanger). We reasoned that the 70 generations between mutation detection and validation allowed sufficient time for mutations that were segregating at generation 60 to drift to fixation, and hence be more reliably detected by Sanger sequencing. The observed fixation probabilities of putative mutations agreed well with the expected probabilities given their initial frequencies at G60 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), suggesting that both the mutations and their frequency estimates were accurate."

The numbers of different types of mutations are proportional to their mutation rates; thus the indel mutation rate was approximately 1/6 that of SBS, and deletions occurred at a frequency three times higher than insertions. Of the 1203 SBS, 595 were transitions (Ti) and 608 were transversions (Tv), corresponding to a Ti/Tv ratio of 1.96 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). There were twice as many base substitution mutations at G or C sites (<i>n</i> = 828) than at A or T sites (<i>n</i> = 401), which, given the 42.48% genomic GC content, indicated a strong bias (~ 2.80 fold increase) towards mutations at G or C bases. These numbers agreed well with a previous study using the same sequencing strategy of three <i>D. melanogaster</i> MA lines, which reported a Ti/Tv ratio of 1.95 and an approximately two-fold increase in mutations at G/C bases (<a href=\"#bib16\">Keightley et al., 2009</a>). We then asked if genomic context affected whether or not a mutation occurred. While there was no appreciable difference in local sequence (20 bp up and downstream) GC content between mutations and randomly sampled sites, indels appeared to occur more often in low complexity regions, where homopolymers and short tandem repeats can often be found and are prone to replication slippage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Standing variation in the DGRP reflects the demographic history of the natural Raleigh, NC population and is depleted of exonic variants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). However, the extent of depletion of exonic spontaneous mutations was much weaker \u2013 the spectrum of spontaneous mutations detected in the MA lines more closely reflected the proportion of exonic, intronic and intergenic bases in the genome (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). We further classified coding variants and mutations according to their functional impacts on polypeptide sequences. Remarkably, the proportions of frame-shift, stop gained or lost, and nonsynonymous spontaneous mutations were significantly greater than the proportion of segregating polymorphisms in the DGRP for these categories (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). While the fitness effects of these protein sequence mutations may differ under laboratory and natural environments, these results clearly indicate that deleterious mutations that would otherwise be lost have accumulated in the MA lines.

For significant GO categories, we further polarized the difference in rate of accumulation of mutational variance as faster or slower within the category. Although mutations occurred randomly across the genome and were not associated with GO categories, the rate of accumulation of genetic variation was significantly different for genes within many GO terms than the rest of the transcriptome (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>). For example, in both sexes, mutational variance accumulated faster for genes involved in chitin metabolism, iron binding, and sensory perception of chemical stimulus, but slower for genes involved in protein translation, mRNA splicing, and mitotic spindle organization. Finally, we compared mutational variation in gene expression to plasticity of gene expression across a wide range of environments (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). We observed that genes that are more plastic to macro-environmental perturbations accumulated genetic variation at a faster rate (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), suggesting a shared control of gene expression variation by mutations and environmental perturbations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Landry et al., 2007</a>)."

We estimated the genome-wide nucleotide diversity in the DGRP (<math id=\"inf30\"><mi>\u03c0</mi></math>) to be <math id=\"inf31\"><mi>\u03c0</mi></math> = 4.92 x 10<sup>\u20133</sup> in the DGRP (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2014</a>), from which we estimated <math id=\"inf32\"><mi>N</mi></math> to be 186,363 (<math id=\"inf33\"><mrow><mfrac><mi>\u03c0</mi><mrow><mn>4</mn><mi>\u03bc</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>). For all organismal and the majority of gene expression traits, the magnitude of standing genetic variation in the DGRP was much smaller than that predicted under the assumption of neutrality (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Therefore, there must be strong stabilizing selection that acts either directly on the traits (direct stabilizing selection) or through pleiotropic fitness effects of new mutations (apparent stabilizing selection), which constrains the accumulation of genetic variation by mutations for gene expression and organismal traits (<a href=\"#bib8\">Denver et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rifkin et al., 2005</a>). To understand the consequence of the strong apparent stabilizing selection, we estimated the expectation of allelic effects based on the observed sequence and quantitative trait variation among the MA and DGRP lines. The amount of genetic variation is proportional to sequence variation by a factor of <math id=\"inf34\"><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></math> (see Materials and methods), where <math id=\"inf35\"><mi>a</mi></math> is the allelic effect of a mutation on quantitative traits. For the majority of traits, the ratio of mutational to standing genetic variance, <math id=\"inf36\"><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>g</mi></msub></mrow></math>, far exceeded the expectation given the observed sequence variation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>); thus the allelic effects of spontaneous mutations, <math id=\"inf37\"><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>a</mi><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></math>, were several orders of magnitude larger than that of standing DNA variation, <math id=\"inf38\"><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>a</mi><mi>g</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></math>. This result suggests that the apparent stabilizing selection, directly for fitness and indirectly for traits correlated with fitness, had either eliminated mutations with large effects on quantitative traits or modified their effects. The former appears to be at least partly true given the obvious difference in functional categorization of spontaneous mutations and standing DNA variation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation, but they are rare and constantly being removed by natural selection and genetic drift. The purifying property of both selection and drift on mutations makes it especially difficult to study the characteristics of spontaneous mutations in natural populations because it is difficult to attribute a mutational pattern to either one of these evolutionary forces. In this study, we combined the classical mutation accumulation design, which subjects inbred lines of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to genetic bottlenecks for many generations, with modern high throughput technologies. This allowed us to largely separate the effects of genetic drift from the combined effects of both selection and drift, a key advantage that is not possible from observations only on natural populations."

On the one hand, lethal and highly deleterious mutations would not accumulate in these lines. On the other hand, beneficial mutations fix at a higher probability than the neutral probability assumed. Although spontaneous mutations occurred at a relatively low rate of 6.60 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20139</sup> averaged over autosomes and the <i>X</i> chromosome, they replenished genetic variation at a significant rate for gene expression (sex averaged rate = 0.65 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup><math id=\"inf51\"><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></mrow></math> per generation) and organismal traits (sex averaged rate = 1.36 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20133</sup><math id=\"inf52\"><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></mrow></math> per generation).

Although the MA lines were derived from the same progenitor line and were raised under homogeneous conditions, mutation rates among the MA lines varied significantly. This implies either that non-genetic factors affect mutagenesis and/or that some spontaneous mutations themselves affect mutation rate; the latter is less plausible because such mutations must occur early in many lines to have a pronounced effect. The MA lines accumulated a broad functional spectrum of spontaneous mutations, including a significant fraction of high impact mutations that would otherwise likely be removed by natural selection. The relatively small number of mutations and the large number of genes with significant mutational variance in expression implies pervasive pleiotropic effects by new mutations. Gene expression traits often form co-expression modules (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ayroles et al., 2009</a>), and therefore mutations that directly influence expression of a small number of loci can cause secondary <i>trans</i> effects at a much larger number of genes. Taking this networked view of gene expression traits, any selection will not act on individual traits, but rather on the combined effects of all traits. Consistent with this notion, we found stronger selection on genes that would cause <i>trans</i> pleiotropic effects such as transcription factors (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>)."

This design, however, does not allow us to infer the effects of genetic background on the rates of mutation and introduction of genetic variation. There is limited evidence for genuine genetic variation for mutation rate. However, this is primarily due to technical limitations because mutation rate is sensitive to environmental and physiological factors that cannot be easily controlled and it is prohibitive to collect genetic data on mutation rates in natural populations. The effects of genetic background can be studied with a modified design using the DGRP by deriving MA lines from multiple genetically diverse inbred strains and controlling environments. Because of the close proximity of mutation rates in this study and earlier studies of the same species, the conclusions drawn in this study are likely to hold across genetic backgrounds, especially given the magnitude of apparent stabilizing selection, which is unlikely to be attributable to genetic factors unique to the ancestral line."

Whole bodies of 10 flies per sample were homogenized with 1\u2009mL of QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen) and two \u00bc inch ceramic beads (MP Biomedical) using the TissueLyser (Qiagen) adjusted to a frequency of 15\u2009Hz for 1 min. Total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNAse I digestion and following the spin technology protocol as outlined in the manufacturer\u2019s manual. The RNA was eluted with 45\u2009\u03bcL of RNAse-free water. Total RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). The 100 RNA samples were processed at all stages in a strict randomized design. Fragmented biotin-labeled aRNA were prepared for hybridization to GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays as described in the GeneChip 3\u2019 IVT Express Kit user manual (Affymetrix P/N 702646 Rev.5). Briefly, 200 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to synthesize first-strand cDNA. The cDNA was converted to double-stranded DNA and used as a template for in vitro transcription to synthesize biotin-labeled aRNA. The aRNA was purified using magnetic RNA binding beads and quantified using a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). 12\u2009\u03bcg of purified biotin-labeled aRNA were fragmented and hybridized to GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix).

Arrays for DGRP_514, MA-21 and MA-23 were not considered because we lacked sequence information for these lines. Probe intensities were corrected for background hybridization using GCRMA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wu et al., 2004</a>) and quantile normalized within each sex. We lifted the probe target alignment to FlyBase annotation (Release 5.57) and retained only those that mapped entirely (can span exon-exon junctions) to constitutive non-overlapping exons and contained no DNA variation among the MA lines or the 40 DGRP lines. The normalized probe intensities were log 2 transformed and estimates of gene expression were obtained using median polish, which adjusted probe effect and removed potential outliers. We did a preliminary normalization and stringently removed arrays that appeared to be contaminated by flies of the opposite sex or contained more than 1% of genes whose expression was more than five standard deviations higher or lower than the mean expression of the same genes across all arrays. A total of 23 out of the 368 arrays were removed before a final normalization was performed on the remaining 345 arrays."

For each gene, we first transformed the data to be normally distributed by taking the quantiles of a normal distribution with the mean equal to the median expression and the variance equal to the square of the median absolute deviation (by a scaling factor of 1.4824 to account for the expected difference of median absolute deviation and variance, which has no effect on the statistical inference). We defined a gene as expressed if its expression level was above 3.71 in females or above 4.26 in males. These cutoffs were chosen such that by modeling the expression profile as a mixture of two normal distributions, for a gene with expression higher than the cutoff, its probability of belonging to the high expression group was at least twice that of belonging to the low expression group (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>). Partition of variance into between-line and within-line variances was performed using the lme4 package in R. It is important to note that the microarray data were collected in three studies such that data sources were completely confounded with the experiments (MA, DGRP, and environmental exposure). Importantly, all estimation of parameters was performed within each experiment such that any between-experiment batch effects that shifted genome-wide gene expression profiles would not affect our results. Batch effects that increased or decreased variances in gene expression, however, may affect the results. Nonetheless, as line or treatment was randomized within each experiment, any such batch effect on variance would be much more likely to affect the within-line variance than the among-line variances that were used for comparison. More importantly, the magnitude of differences in variances, which was also consistent with other studies that assessed the differences within a single batch (<a href=\"#bib8\">Denver et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rifkin et al., 2005</a>), was too large to be explained by a batch effect."

Prior to sleep measurement, all flies were maintained at a constant density of 30 flies per same-sex vial to mitigate the effects of both social exposure and mating on sleep. We recorded seven continuous days of sleep and activity using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring System (Trikinetics, Waltham, MA), which measures the numbers of times each fly crosses an infrared beam. Data from flies that did not survive the entire recording period were not used in the sleep calculations. Sleep duration was calculated as any period of inactivity lasting at least five minutes. Waking activity was calculated as the number of times the fly crossed the infrared beam divided by the total time awake. We also measured bristle numbers in the 39 DGRP lines for which we had expression data or obtained the sleep phenotypic data for the same lines from a previous study (<a href=\"#bib11\">Harbison et al., 2009</a>). The same analysis as the gene expression data was performed to partition variance for the organismal quantitative traits for both MA and DGRP lines, except for bristle numbers, for which an additional between-replicate term was also included."

And of course it is not surprising that the quantitative traits are under stabilizing selection. Bristle are sort of a classic QT, that they are under stabilizing selection is discussed in the \"textbook\" of Falconer and Mackay. It is perhaps a novel observation that sleep and activity traits are under stabilizing selection, but not really surprising (thinking of humans sleep time has a mean of 8 hours and SD of 1 hour, it is easy to imagine sleeping 6 SD's more or less is highly deleterious)."

Observations on a number of quantitative traits including bristle number and gene expression and DNA sequences were obtained on all (or nearly all) MA lines. Thus the authors could estimate spontaneous mutation rates for variables ranging from molecular sequence to phenotypes of quantitative traits. The variances and distributions of traits among these lines were compared with those among the DGRP lines and differences used to infer the degree of selection operating in the new lines."

One significant observation from these lines was that, inter alia, the base mutation rates differed among the new MA lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). This of course implies that comparisons between mutation rates for traits such as bristle number also presumably vary among lines. The evidence for and estimates of e.g. stabilising selection on the phenotypic traits, notably bristle number, were obtained by comparing the variance among the DGRP lines with that predicted from these mutation rates in the MA lines. As there is evidence of between line variance in the MA lines derived from a single DGRP line, there is every reason to expect that there would be differences in the mutation rates among the DGRP lines themselves. Hence the estimates of mutation rate and of stabilising selection effects in comparing the MA and DGRP lines is, presumably, sensitive to choice of DGRP line."

A better design would, in some respects, have been to have taken a subset of MA lines from several (a sample of) DGRP lines to assess and allow for genetic variation in mutation rates among the DGRP lines. There are obviously other benefits in terms of comparisons in sequence etc. by just using one DGRP line, but the problem of lack of replication remains nevertheless. At the very least the authors need to discuss this: the flaw will be apparent to others also."

With rare alleles, and assuming mutation/selection balance, the selection estimated from <i>V<sub>m</sub>/V<sub>g</sub></i> equals the harmonic mean s, weighted by the squared affect on traits. Thus, of the effect on the trait is not correlated with fitness, we have 1/&lt;1/s&gt;, whereas if the trait is fitness itself, we have <s^2>/<s>, which must be larger.

Nevertheless, earlier studies using multiple MA lines derived from different ancestors did not suggest a large genetic variation in mutation rate (Keightley et al., 2009). Moreover, because we need to estimate mutational variance accurately for a large number of traits, we are more concerned with their accuracy than mutation rate <i>per se</i>. Perhaps most importantly, the level of the observed stabilizing selection was too large to be explained by genetic variation between lines. While we acknowledge the limitation in the experimental design, what we observed are likely to generalize and indeed are corroborated by earlier studies (also see references in the text)."

The mutation rate estimated using a full-sib family agreed within the 95% confidence intervals with ours (Keightley, et al. 2014), suggesting that the mutation rate was not drastically higher in inbred lines. However, there were only eight mutations in total detected and confirmed in the Keightley (2014) study, which brings us to the second point. Even if there were such trio data, because of the small mutation rate, the number of mutations present in a single fly genome is small (on average ~1-2 mutations per fly). This requires an enormous number of flies to be sequenced to enable a meaningful comparison. This is precisely the point of doing mutation accumulation, which is to accumulate mutations in the MA lines so there characteristics can be properly studied."

I don't think this necessarily follows. If there is a distribution of effects on traits, then the ratio V<sub>m</sub>/V<sub>g</sub> will be smaller for traits that are less closely connected with fitness. With rare alleles, and assuming mutation/selection balance, the selection estimated from V<sub>m</sub>/V<sub>g</sub> equals the harmonic mean s, weighted by the squared affect on traits. Thus, of the effect on the trait is not correlated with fitness, we have 1/&lt;1/s&gt;, whereas if the trait is fitness itself, we have &lt;s^2&gt;/&lt;s&gt;, which must be larger. So, the differences in V<sub>m</sub>/V<sub>g</sub> between viability and gene expression are surely to be expected?</i>"

To this end and following the reviewers\u2019 comments in the previous revision, we have provided detailed information on the rationale and expectation of the experimental outcomes. We believe this is of sufficiently clarity. While we are aware of the discrepancies between the data and theories and the fact that there have been presently no consensus theory to reconcile the two, we discuss the implications at the end of the manuscript in length, hoping that the ongoing debate won\u2019t distract the main experimental results."

There is a distribution of effects and by using the median as the numerical example, we are making the point that at least 50% of the genes are experiencing selection that\u2019s weaker than selection on fitness.
