Critically, however, we also need to protect our DNA from damage, or to repair it when it gets damaged. Sources of damage include certain chemicals produced during metabolism and various forms of radiation. Some DNA repair pathways are relatively simple: an enzyme called photolyase, for example, can repair the damage caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun in a single reaction. However, it takes many different proteins to repair the train wreck that is caused when a DNA replication fork runs into a section of DNA damage during the process of DNA replication."

That being said, are we all optimized for DNA repair? Could we do it better? This is an important consideration because we live in an environment that can damage DNA in many different ways and, if this damage is not repaired, it can sometimes lead to diseases such as cancer. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Michael Cox of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and co-workers\u2014including Rose Byrne and Audrey Klingele as joint first authors\u2014report that mutations in just three genes can allow the bacteria <i>Escherichia coli</i> to improve its ability to repair DNA by a factor of 1000.

The bacteria <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>, for example, is several orders of magnitude more resistant to ionizing radiation than <i>E. coli</i>. Why? Does <i>D. rad</i> have more or different DNA repair pathways? The <i>D. rad</i> genome contains approximately the same repertoire of repair enzymes as <i>E. coli</i>. Does this mean that <i>D. rad</i> has a higher concentration of repair enzymes? Or perhaps the repair enzymes in <i>D. rad</i> are just better at their doing their jobs because they have higher specific activities and/or binding affinities? It is well known that cells respond to DNA damage by expressing DNA repair proteins. Perhaps <i>D. rad</i> responds faster than <i>E. coli</i>, or perhaps its response has a greater amplitude? Maybe the increased resistance is due to something else, such as the way that DNA is packaged inside the nucleus. Or perhaps <i>D. rad</i> is better able to detoxify the reactive oxygen species created by the radiation and/or to cope with damaged proteins?"

To tackle this problem, they used the combined power of in vitro evolution and bacteria genetics and let the bacteria untie the knot for them. They exposed cultures of <i>E. coli</i> to devastating amounts of ionizing radiation, isolated those that managed to survive, and repeated this process. After 20 cycles of this process, the cultures of <i>E. coli</i> were 3\u20134 orders of magnitude more resistant to ionizing radiation than the starting <i>E. coli</i> strains (<a href=\"#bib2\">Harris et al., 2009</a>)."

By transferring these mutations, both singly and in combinations, to fresh strains of <i>E. coli</i>, and by removing them from evolved strains of the bacteria, they were able to determine that mutations to three genes<i>\u2014recA</i>, <i>dnaB</i> and <i>yfjK</i>\u2014accounted for about 1000-fold of the increased resistance to ionizing radiation. Moreover, <i>recA</i> and <i>dnaB</i> were in the same DNA repair pathways, while <i>yfjK</i> was in another repair pathway. The other mutations made measureable, but smaller contributions. Cox and co-workers also checked for global changes in the transcriptome, the metablome and metal ion content and found none, so the mutations in these three genes must be the primary reason for the increase in resistance."
