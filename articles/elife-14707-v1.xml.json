An OCRE (OCtamer REpeat of aromatic residues) domain found in RBM5 is important for alternative splicing regulation and mediates interactions with components of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. We show that the RBM5 OCRE domain adopts a unique \u03b2\u2013sheet fold. NMR and biochemical experiments demonstrate that the OCRE domain directly binds to the proline-rich C-terminal tail of the essential snRNP core proteins SmN/B/B\u2019. The NMR structure of an OCRE-SmN peptide complex reveals a specific recognition of poly-proline helical motifs in SmN/B/B\u2019. Mutation of conserved aromatic residues impairs binding to the Sm proteins <i>in vitro</i> and compromises RBM5-mediated alternative splicing regulation of FAS/CD95. Thus, RBM5 OCRE represents a poly-proline recognition domain that mediates critical interactions with the C-terminal tail of the spliceosomal SmN/B/B\u2019 proteins in <i>FAS/CD95</i> alternative splicing regulation."

We show that the RBM5 OCRE domain adopts a unique \u03b2\u2013sheet fold. NMR and biochemical experiments demonstrate that the OCRE domain directly binds to the proline-rich C-terminal tail of the essential snRNP core proteins SmN/B/B\u2019. The NMR structure of an OCRE-SmN peptide complex reveals a specific recognition of poly-proline helical motifs in SmN/B/B\u2019. Mutation of conserved aromatic residues impairs binding to the Sm proteins <i>in vitro</i> and compromises RBM5-mediated alternative splicing regulation of FAS/CD95. Thus, RBM5 OCRE represents a poly-proline recognition domain that mediates critical interactions with the C-terminal tail of the spliceosomal SmN/B/B\u2019 proteins in <i>FAS/CD95</i> alternative splicing regulation."

The catalytic steps of pre-mRNA splicing are carried out by the spliceosome, a large and dynamic assembly of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes and more than 150 additional splicing factor proteins (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wahl et al., 2009</a>). Many splicing factors are involved in early steps of the assembly of the spliceosome through the recognition of short regulatory RNA motifs and/or through protein-protein interactions. Alternative splicing is the mechanism by which particular intronic or exonic regions are included or excluded to produce diverse mRNAs from the same gene (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blencowe, 2006</a>). It is thought that more than 90% of human multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). The genomic diversity of eukaryotic gene expression is thus greatly expanded by alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts. Often, the protein products of alternative splicing have antagonistic roles in cellular functions and are implicated in human diseases (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cooper et al., 2009</a>). Notably, mutations in splicing factors that modulate alternative splicing decisions have been implicated in cancer (<a href=\"#bib17\">David and Manley, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bonnal et al., 2012</a>)."

Alternatively spliced <i>FAS</i> transcripts that exclude exon 6 encode a soluble Fas isoform that lacks the transmembrane domain. This soluble isoform can be secreted outside of the cell where it sequesters the FAS ligand and inhibits downstream activation of apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cheng et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cascino et al., 1995</a>). Thus, regulation of the alternative splicing of <i>FAS</i> can either stimulate or inhibit cell survival. The pro-apoptotic Fas protein plays an important role during T-lymphocyte maturation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Papoff et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Van Parijs et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Roesler et al., 2005</a>) and additional evidence implicates this isoform in the proliferation of cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2010</a>)."

The multi-domain RNA-binding protein 5 (RBM5) regulates <i>FAS</i> splicing by promoting skipping of exon 6 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bonnal et al., 2008</a>). RBM5 is a 92\u2009kDa, multi-domain protein with an arginine-serine (RS)-rich region, two RNA Recognition Motifs (RRM1 and RRM2), two Zinc-Finger domains (ZF1 and ZF2), a C-terminal OCtamer REpeat (OCRE) domain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Callebaut and Mornon, 2005</a>) in addition to a glycine patch, and KEKE (lysine/glutamate) repeats (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). It belongs to the family of RNA Binding Motif (RBM) proteins, including RBM6 and RBM10, which share a similar domain organization with RBM5 and have 30% and 50% amino acid identity, respectively (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sutherland et al., 2005</a>). The RBM5 (also known as H37 and LUCA-15) and RBM6 genes are located in a\u00a0chromosomal region 3p21.3, which is frequently deleted in heavy smokers and lung cancers (<a href=\"#bib49\">Oh et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zabarovsky et al., 2002</a>).

It has also been reported to suppress metastasis by modulating the expression of Rac1, \u03b2-catenin, collagen and laminin (<a href=\"#bib48\">Oh et al., 2010</a>).

An N-terminal extension (residues 452\u2013459) packs against one side of the \u03b2\u2212sheet and is connected to the \u03b21 strand by a 3<sub>10</sub> helix (residues 459\u2013461) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C,D</a>). The six \u03b2\u2013strands form a twisted \u03b2\u2013sheet where aromatic side chains are exposed on opposite surfaces of the \u03b2\u2013sheet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). On one side, the aromatic side chains of Tyr464 (in strand \u03b21), Tyr 471 (\u03b22), Tyr480 (\u03b23), Tyr487 (\u03b24) form extended aromatic side chain interactions on the surface. Tyr487 forms an additional hydrophobic cluster with Tyr462 and Pro457 from the N-terminal extension. Trp498 and Tyr505 from the C-terminal extension, and the N-terminal Tyr454 are also involved in this cluster (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This forms a compact fold that is further stabilized by a salt bridge involving Lys453 and Glu503 and thus brings the N- and C-terminal regions of the OCRE domain in close spatial proximity. Due to the interactions with residues from the N-terminal extension this aromatic surface of the OCRE domain is shielded from the solvent.

The N-terminal extension has an extended conformation consistent with secondary <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Although the topology of the six antiparallel \u03b2-strands is rather simple, the twisted \u03b2-sheet of the OCRE domain appears unique. Structural similarity searches with Dali (<a href=\"#bib27\">Holm et al., 2008</a>) and SSM (<a href=\"#bib36\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</a>) did not reveal any significant structural homologs (Z-scores &lt;2), indicating that the OCRE domain represents a unique fold. While the \u03b2-sheet fold is quite simple, the specific arrangement of the N-terminal extension represent the\u00a0unique features of the OCRE fold. The electrostatic surface potential of the OCRE domain is predominantly negatively charged with some hydrophobic patches (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), consistent with a potential role in protein\u2013protein interactions and less likely for nucleic acid binding."

These include Tyr495, Tyr497 on one surface of the fold and Tyr454, Glu501 and Asp458 on the opposite side. To assess the functional relevance of these residues, we generated triple and double point mutations (Y495/Y497/E501(YYE)&gt;AAK) and (Y454/458(YD)&gt;AR), respectively. The mutants were expressed in HeLa cells, co-transfected with a <i>FAS</i> alternative splicing reporter (<a href=\"#bib25\">Forch et al., 2000</a>) and the pattern of Fas exon 6 inclusion/skipping analyzed by RT-PCR. While the YD mutant had similar activity as the WT protein in promoting Fas exon 6 skipping, the YYE mutation failed to induce significant levels of <i>FAS</i> exon 6 skipping, similar to the effect of deleting the entire OCRE domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). To further investigate the importance of the residues in the YYE cluster, single point mutants were generated (Y495A, Y497A, E501D/K) and tested by co-transfection. Replacement of the aromatic tyrosines that are exposed on one surface of the \u03b2-sheet to alanine impaired the function of the protein in FAS alternative splicing regulation, arguing that the\u00a0tyrosine residues in the surface of the \u03b2-sheet are important for the function of the OCRE domain in splicing regulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

We also found RBM5 as an interacting partner in a two-hybrid screen using the C-terminal tail of human SmB as bait (unpublished results). SmN/B/B' are components of the Sm core, a heptamer of Sm proteins that associates with all spliceosomal snRNPs except U6. While SmB and SmB\u2019 are ubiquitous, SmN is primarily found in neuronal and cardiac cells but has also been found to be expressed in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sharpe et al., 1990</a>). The three SmN/B/B\u2019 isoforms have a similar domain architecture, comprising a small globular N-terminal Sm domain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kambach et al., 1999</a>) and a C-terminal region that is expected to be intrinsically disordered. The C-terminal region starts with an arginine-glycine (RG)-rich region at ~residue 90 that harbors symmetrically dimethylated arginine residues, and additionally comprises a 60\u201370 residue proline-rich region of unknown function beyond residue 167 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

As an initial test, we verified that recombinant purified GST-RBM5, or a derivative containing the C-terminal (OCRE-containing) domain, pulled down <i>in vitro</i> translated SmB, while a GST-fusion of the N-terminal domain of RBM5 did not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Next we carried out pull-down experiments using recombinant GST-tagged RBM5 OCRE domains (wild type and mutants where surface-exposed tyrosine residues are replaced by alanine) and assessed the ability to pull down purified recombinant N-terminal T7 epitope-tagged-SmN protein produced in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

This indicates that all SmN fragments harboring PRMs utilize the same binding site on the OCRE domain. The strongest CSPs are observed for the amides of Y470, Y488, and Y495, which map to the cluster of exposed aromatic tyrosines on \u03b22, \u03b24, and \u03b25 of the OCRE domain, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). However, the short peptide containing four consecutive proline residues induces comparable CSPs only at much higher peptide:OCRE ratio compared to the longer Sm tail peptides, thus indicating higher binding affinity for the longer Sm tail constructs (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Nearly identical spectral changes are induced by the peptide, suggesting that all PRMs contribute to the overall affinity for the OCRE domain. Thus, the interaction with multiple motifs is enhanced by avidity, e.g., interaction of multiple PRMs within the Sm tails provides increased local concentration of PRM ligand motifs and thereby contributes to the significantly higher affinity of Sm-tails compared to a single PRM."

This analysis reveals the presence of multiple (five to six) PRMs harboring three or four consecutive prolines in SmB or SmN, which are flanked by conserved arginine residues within \u00b13 residues on either side of the poly-proline motif (<a href=\"#bib68\">Weber et al., 2010</a>). The role of these conserved sequence features was probed by compared binding affinities of wild type and variant Sm tails to the RBM5 OCRE domain using ITC experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Reducing the number or PRMs significantly decreases the binding affinity, consistent with avidity effects and contribution to the overall affinity by the presence of multiple PRMs. Replacing four prolines by four alanines has little effect. This observation is consistent with the fact that consecutive stretches of alanines adopt a poly-proline type II (PPII) helical conformation, as confirmed by CD spectra (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As the SmN/B/B\u2019 PRMs adopt a PPII helical conformation when bound to the OCRE domain (see below), the replacement by four alanines can thus be tolerated to some extent. Notably, charge reversal of two arginines flanking the poly-proline motif on either side significantly decreases the binding affinity. These data suggest that a PPII helical conformation flanked by positively charged arginine residues is specifically recognized by the OCRE domain."

As the binding affinities of these peptides are beyond the detection limit of ITC, we resorted to a semi-quantitative NMR CSP-based approach. We devised a normalized CSP score for a set of seven amide signals surrounding the binding pocket showing significant CSPs in the OCRE domain to obtain a proxy for the relative binding affinities (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3B\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As the comparison between different peptides is based on the CSP score derived from the same set of residues, it indirectly reflects their relative binding affinities. Several themes emerge from this comparison suggesting that the OCRE domain has a preferred binding motif, but can also accommodate some sequence variants. First, wild type peptides with three prolines induce smaller CSPs than those with four proline motifs and binding saturation is achieved only at higher peptide concentration, indicating a lower affinity. PRMs harboring only three consecutive proline residues show 2\u20133-fold reduced affinity relative to four proline motifs. Second, an APAP motif, which disrupts PPII conformations, has a strongly reduced CSP score, suggesting that the structure and composition of the PPII are important for interaction. Third, both arginines flanking the PRM motif are important for the interaction, as a double charge reversal (R\u2192E) strongly reduces the binding affinity. Neutralizing the charge with R\u2192A mutations had a smaller effect, presumably because no charge clashes are introduced with the negatively charged surface of the OCRE domain (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) as is the case for R\u2192E mutations. Taken together, the analysis shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> indicates that a PPII conformation mediated by four consecutive proline residues with flanking positively charged residues is optimal for OCRE binding. Notably, the arginine residue preceding the PRM appears more important for the interaction than the one located C-terminal to the PRM."

This motif is also found within residues 219\u2013229 in SmB with only one amino acid difference (GMRPPPPGMRG). The structure of the complex is defined by numerous NOEs, and is supported by 109 distance restraints derived from intermolecular NOEs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The structure shows that the central proline stretch (SmN Pro222-Pro225) of the bound peptide adopts a PPII helix (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The PPII conformation is also indicated by the <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts of the peptide. Considering the large excess of peptide, the chemical shifts largely reflect the unbound state. This indicates that the PPII conformation is already preformed in the absence of the OCRE domain, consistent with our CD data (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The central part of the proline-rich peptide interacts with conserved tyrosine residues in the OCRE domain in strands \u03b23 (Tyr470, Tyr479), \u03b24 (Tyr486, Tyr488) and \u03b25 (Tyr495) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). On one side, Tyr488 stacks with SmN Pro222 and on the other with Tyr479, which itself contacts SmN Pro224 by T-stacking.

Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib57\">Saltzman et al., 2011</a>), we observed that the knock down of the SmN/B/B\u2019 proteins by siRNA in HeLa cells led to an increase in the level of <i>FAS</i> exon 6 skipping in endogenous transcripts or in transcripts derived from a Fas reporter (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A,C</a>).

To assess which region of the RBM5 protein is required, we performed <i>in vitro</i> spliceosome assembly assays with AdML pre-mRNA, using the N- and C-terminal halves of RBM5 as well as with a C-terminal version that lacks the OCRE domain or a fragment that includes only the OCRE and KEKE domains (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These and additional transient transfection experiments (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) confirm that the inhibition of complex B formation depends on the C-terminal region of RBM5 and reveal that the OCRE domain is necessary but not sufficient for this activity. This is consistent with a key role for the interaction of OCRE with the PRM in the spliceosomal tails in the tri-snRNP, but argues that additional interactions involving the C-terminal region of RBM5 are important, including for example the previously reported interaction with U2AF65 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bonnal et al., 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "The Octamer Repeat (OCRE) domain of RBM5 adopts a unique three-dimensional fold with a large number of conserved tyrosine residues. Although the primary sequence signature could suggest a linear sequence of octamer repeats, our structural analysis clearly reveals that the OCRE domain adopts a small globular fold. We show that the twisted \u03b2-sheet of the OCRE domain exposes conserved tyrosine residues that provide a platform for the recognition of a proline rich motif (PRM). This interaction is based upon a network of tyrosine residues as well as anchoring residues located in the loops of the \u03b2-strands. The SmN PRM is flanked by a positively charged arginine residue preceding the four consecutive prolines, followed by a hydrophobic residue and another arginine. Taking into account the sequence conservation, binding studies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), and the details of molecular recognition of the SmN peptide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we propose that the OCRE domain recognizes a RPPP(P)G\u03d5R consensus motif. A key feature of the motif is a central PPII helix, which is recognized by a network of parallel and aromatic T-stacking of Tyr470, Tyr479, Tyr482, Tyr488 and Tyr495 with the proline side chains in the PPII helix. These tyrosines are exposed at one side of the OCRE \u03b2-sheet and collectively embed the PPII helix. Specific contacts that define the orientation of the bound peptide are mediated by two flanking arginine residues, with a stronger contribution of the N-terminal arginine (SmN Arg221, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The glycine residue may enable an unusual backbone conformation such that hydrophobic residues (\u03d5, Ile/Met/Val flanking different PRMs in the SmN/B/B\u2019 C-terminal tails, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) can shield the central hydrophobic PPII motif from solvent exposure. Notably, unbound PRMs harboring 3\u20134 consecutive prolines already adopt (at least partially) a preformed PPII conformation and thus reduce the entropy loss associated with binding to the OCRE domain. The somewhat reduced affinity for peptides with only three prolines may reflect a smaller propensity of forming PPII conformation in the free ligands and the lack of a preceding arginine, which is consistently present in all four proline PRMs."

The relatively weak affinity of a single PRM found in the Sm tails argues that avidity effects due to the presence of multiple motifs play an important role for high affinity binding by increasing the local concentration of PRM motifs available for OCRE binding. We note that avidity effects provided by multiple binding sites have also been observed for other PRM binding domains (<a href=\"#bib65\">Varani et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Klippel et al., 2011</a>), and that this feature is reminiscent of the recognition of dimethyl-arginine residues in the Sm tails by Tudor domains (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tripsianes et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, the weak binding affinity of a single motif indicates that the interaction between RBM5 and SmN/B/B\u2019 may have been selected to be transient, as expected for a regulatory interaction that needs to promote interactions with the spliceosome but also needs to be disrupted at later steps of the splicing reaction."

The role of RBM5 and its OCRE domain in this context could be to attract the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP to the splice sites. The fact that the SmN/B/B\u2019 tails are intrinsically disordered and extend very far away from the seven-membered Sm core ring in U snRNPs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>), is consistent with such an activity. In fact, the recent EM structure of the tri-snRNP (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>) revealed that the Sm cores of U4 and U5, as well as the LSm ring of U6 are located at the outside of this large RNP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Thus, the C-terminal tails of SmN/B/B\u2019 of the U4 and U5 components are clearly accessible and could scan for possible binding partners of their proline-rich motifs, such as the RBM5 OCRE domain. This could help to localize the tri-snRNP to the splice sites that are regulated by RBM5."

Recently, mutations in SmB were linked to cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bacrot et al., 2015</a>). The multi-domain protein RBM5 promotes <i>FAS</i> exon 6 skipping and it has been proposed that for this activity the protein modulates splice site pairing after the competing 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 splice sites have been recognized by U1 and U2 snRNPs, respectively (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bonnal et al., 2008</a>). This model is based upon the observation that RBM5 inhibits the transition from A (U2 snRNP binding) to B (U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP binding) complex formation in the introns flanking exon 6. It is conceivable that interactions mediated by the C-terminal tails of SmN/B/B\u2019, which are present in U1, U2 and the tri-snRNP, facilitate the transition from A to B complex and that binding of the OCRE domain of RBM5 prevents these interactions and therefore the\u00a0progression of spliceosome assembly. Direct or indirect association of RBM5 with particular regions of the pre-mRNA \u2013 likely involving other regions of the protein including RRM or zinc finger domains \u2013 may prevent A to B transition of pre-spliceosomes assembled on the flanking introns of exon 6, but fail to prevent tri-snRNP assembly on the distal splice sites, thus facilitating exon skipping. Alternatively, or in addition, RBM5 interaction with the C-terminal tails of SmN/B/B\u2019 may lead to a general decrease in snRNP function, possibly more acute for U2 snRNP. As decreased activity of U2 snRNP \u2013 e.g. by individual knock down of its protein components \u2013 is known to result in increased <i>FAS</i> exon skipping (<a href=\"#bib51\">Papasaikas et al., 2015</a>), RBM5-mediated reduction in U2 function could potentially explain at least part of the effects of the protein on <i>FAS</i> splicing regulation."

Due to the relatively weak interaction, NMR titrations were used to compare relative affinities between wild type peptides and peptides with specific mutations. The SmN derived wild type and mutant peptides were titrated into OCRE at a 1:10 ratio of OCRE:peptide. CSPs from 7 OCRE residues (Y470, Y471, Y479, D481, N483, S490, Y495) were added for each of the peptide titration and normalized with that of the wild type peptide (GMRPPPPGIRG). The score is used to compare the relative affinities of the various peptides with the wild type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

There are many regulatory proteins that bind to the pre-mRNA to alter spliceosome assembly, but remarkably few interactions have been described between these regulators and core components of the spliceosome. Such information is key to understanding the mechanisms of splicing regulation. In previous work, the Valc\u00e1rcel lab has characterized the Rbm5 family of splicing regulators, showing that they control important splicing events for apoptosis and cancer progression. They also reported that the octamer repeat (OCRE) domain of the Rbm5 protein interacts with the tri-snRNP complex that forms part of the mature spliceosome. OCRE domains containing repeats of aromatic residues are found in multiple proteins but their structure and interactions are unknown. Here the authors solve the structure of the Rbm5 OCRE by NMR, showing that it adopts an antiparallel \u03b2 sheet structure with each repeat comprising a \u03b2 strand. The conserved tyrosines project from both sides of the sheet. An N-terminal extension interacts with the residues on one face of the sheet to stabilize the domain, while tyrosines on the opposite face are available for other interactions. The authors define repeated proline-rich motifs within the C-terminal domains of the SmN/B/B' proteins as ligands for the OCRE domain. They show this interaction requires particular aromatic residues on the interaction surface of OCRE. They define a consensus proline rich motif (PRM) on the SmN protein that is required for OCRE interaction, and which includes 3 or 4 continuous proline residues flanked by arginines. Solving the structure of the OCRE bound to this motif, they show that the PRM forms a proline type II helix and the OCRE engages the PRM through a combination of aromatic stacking interactions between the prolines and the tyrosines, and both hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with the flanking arginines. Through coexpression of mutant Rbm5 with a reporter minigene they show that these OCRE residues are indeed needed for Rbm5 regulatory activity. Finally, they compare OCRE to other domains such as SH3 and WW that also use aromatic residues to recognize poly-proline motifs."
