This appears to allow PTEN-deficient cells to outcompete neighboring wild-type cells; Nowak et al. suggest these rapidly proliferating cells are capable of effectively hoarding nutrient stores, both in their immediate vicinity and organism-wide. Further studies that focus on changes in gene expression may be able to uncover the mechanism that allows PTEN-deficient cells to proliferate when nutrients are restricted. Moreover, by shedding light on a factor that has an important influence on tumor development, these results may have implications for cancer treatment strategies."

It is therefore desirable to target earlier tumorigenic stages but we know comparatively little about how pre-cancerous cells progressively develop into tumors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moreno, 2008</a>). The model system <i>Drosophila</i> allows analyzing the behavior of cells lacking particular tumor suppressor functions. During the growth phase (larval instars), the cells of the imaginal discs (that will eventually give rise to adult appendages) remain diploid and proliferate until the discs have reached an appropriate size. The simple architecture of the imaginal discs (the disc proper consists of a single cell-layered epithelium and is covered by the peripodial epithelium) enables the labeling and tracking of cell populations. These cell populations can be genetically manipulated with the help of sophisticated tools. Finally, since the larvae live in their food, cellular stress situations can be imposed by controlling the food source."

PTEN is well conserved from flies to humans, and it is the second most frequently mutated tumor suppressor found in many types of human cancers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goberdhan and Wilson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Salmena et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hollander et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Song et al., 2012</a>). PTEN antagonizes the function of the lipid kinase Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K); therefore, in the absence of PTEN<i>,</i> high levels of the lipid second messenger PIP3 result in an increased membrane recruitment and activation of the serine/threonine kinase PKB (protein kinase B, also known as Akt), which leads to enhanced cellular growth, proliferation, and survival (<a href=\"#bib2\">Altomare and Testa, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Georgescu, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Song et al., 2012</a>). The consequences of activating PI3K signaling due to <i>PI3K</i> overexpression or loss of <i>PTEN</i> function has been extensively studied in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Leevers et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Goberdhan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Weinkove et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gao et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Britton et al., 2002</a>). Cells overexpressing <i>Dp110/PI3K</i> are enlarged and, in the fat body, increase their nutrient storage. This stockpiling of nutrients helps them to cell-autonomously bypass the nutritional requirements for cellular growth and DNA replication during amino acid deprivation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Britton et al., 2002</a>). In mitotic tissues, clones of <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells are enlarged, which is mainly caused by an increase in cell size (<a href=\"#bib33\">Leevers et al., 1996</a>). However, given the importance of PTEN as a tumor suppressor, the overgrowth caused by the loss of PTEN is rather mild (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goberdhan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gao et al., 2000</a>)."

Yeast is the main source for micronutrients and amino acids in standard fly media. We observed a three-phase starvation response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Our standard medium contains 100 g/l yeast. Down to 50 g/l yeast, larvae can be regarded as fully fed since the developmental time, weight, and survival were not affected. At a yeast concentration range between 50 g/l and 10 g/l, the development was gradually delayed and the weight decreased. This phase can be regarded as mild starvation, since survival was not compromised down to 25 g/l yeast concentration. Reduction of the yeast concentration to and below 10 g/l increased the developmental time from first instar to pupa and severely decreased body weight. Since mortality was also increased, this phase is regarded as severe starvation. Based on these results, the turning point between mild starvation and severe starvation is approximately at 10 g/l concentration of yeast."

In contrast, hypomorphic <i>PTEN</i> larvae and adult flies were larger than wild-type controls under normal food conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The prospective adult tissues, the eye and wing imaginal discs, were larger compared to control discs under both conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). <i>PTEN</i> hypomorphic larvae were highly sensitive to a reduction in yeast content, and although still larger, they did not survive to pupariation when reared on 10 g/l yeast food (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This is consistent with the findings that larvae with randomly induced PI3K overexpression clones are starvation sensitive (<a href=\"#bib4\">Britton et al., 2002</a>).

To mimic the clonal nature of cancer, we analyzed the loss of <i>PTEN</i> function in clones generated in mitotic tissues (imaginal discs) by hsFlp/FRT-mediated mitotic recombination (<a href=\"#bib19\">Golic and Lindquist, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xu and Rubin, 1993</a>). This system enables the generation of single genetically marked epithelial cells mutant for a defined tumor suppressor. Subsequent mitoses give rise to a patch of cells (\u2018clone\u2019) devoid of the tumor suppressor. The clones can be tracked throughout development due to genetically encoded markers (usually GFP). In a typical experiment, we induced clones by a heat shock 24 hr after egg laying. Subsequently, the larvae were split into two populations and transferred to vials with yeast concentrations of 100 g/l and 10 g/l, respectively. The discs were then dissected to analyze the clones either at the same time point or at the same developmental stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

Under mild starvation conditions (30 g/l yeast), <i>PTEN</i> clones were further increased in size, resulting in an overall increase in disc size as compared to discs harboring control clones. Reducing the yeast concentration to 20 g/l and below led to a massive size increase of the <i>PTEN</i> clones and to a concomitant reduction of the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, the <i>PTEN</i> clones had fused and rendered the discs lobed in appearance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). At 5 g/l yeast concentration, the eye discs with <i>PTEN</i> mutant tissue were severely overgrown with polyp-like structures protruding from the discs (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The resulting adult eyes displayed strong malformations and outgrowths, indicating a loss of epithelial integrity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, red squares). In some cases, no clones could be recovered in the adult eyes, probably due to a collapse of the <i>PTEN</i> clones resulting in melanized scars (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, white arrow). Tangential eye sections did not reveal any structural defects in ommatidial arrangement (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells overgrow in a cell-autonomous manner as the enlarged ommatidia were exclusively composed of mutant cells. The overgrowth phenotype of <i>PTEN</i> clones is not specific to the eye; it was also observed in other imaginal tissues like the wing disc (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

We used the eyeless-(ey)Flp/FRT system to induce clones specifically in the eye imaginal tissues early during larval development. When the transfer from starvation to normal food occurred within the first 72 hr, the overgrowth of the <i>PTEN</i> clones was efficiently rescued. Later shifts were no longer effective in suppressing the overgrowth. Consistently, it was sufficient to transfer larvae within the first 48 hr from normal to starvation food to produce the overgrowth phenotype. After this time point, <i>PTEN</i> clones did not acquire the full growth advantage over the surrounding tissue, confirming the importance of the initial stages for <i>PTEN</i> clones to develop the overgrowth phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

Under normal food conditions, the eye size increase was mainly caused by larger ommatidia (+27%), and to a minor extent by more ommatidia (+14%). Under 10 g/l yeast food, the ommatidial size was roughly proportionally reduced in wild-type and <i>PTEN</i> mutant eyes. Intriguingly, whereas the ommatidia number was decreased by 6% in wild-type eyes, it was massively increased in <i>PTEN</i> mutant eyes (+44%). Since the composition of the <i>PTEN</i> mutant ommatidia remained unchanged, the size and number of ommatidia reflects cell size and cell number.

Due to the extremely small size of the wild-type discs under NR, we were not able to generate enough tissue for the analysis. Although the total levels of PKB were decreased in <i>PTEN</i> mutant tissue under both conditions as compared to the control under normal food conditions, the P-PKB levels were elevated. Thus, high PIP3 levels result in robust PKB activation under standard and starvation conditions.

High TORC1 activity boosts cellular growth, at least in part via the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib22\">Hietakangas and Cohen, 2009</a>). <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells did respond to starvation by reducing the levels of S6K and of phosphorylated S6K (P-S6K), as revealed by Western blot analysis on discs bearing eyFlp/FRT cell lethal clones of <i>PTEN</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). PKB signaling activity was also slightly reduced as compared to standard conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We next inhibited TORC1 activity selectively in <i>PTEN</i> clones by co-overexpression of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-1 and -2 (Tsc1/2)\u2014which together form a complex with GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity towards the small GTPase Rheb, an essential activator of TORC1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Garami et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>)\u2014or by removing <i>Rheb</i> function.

P-PKB levels, however, were increased in the mutant tissue under both fed and NR conditions (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), which is in agreement with the negative feedback regulation of TORC1 on the activation of PKB (<a href=\"#bib43\">Radimerski et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kockel et al., 2010</a>). Eyes mutant for <i>PTEN</i> and a hypomorphic allele of <i>TOR</i> were reduced to the size of control eyes at both fed and starved conditions, indicating that the overgrowth of <i>PTEN</i> clones strictly depends on normal TORC1 function (<a href=\"#fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Interestingly, whereas the size reduction of <i>PTEN</i> clones caused by impaired TORC1 function was primarily due to smaller ommatidia under normal conditions, ommatidia size was only slightly affected under starvation. By contrast, the hyperproliferation observed in <i>PTEN</i> clones under NR was almost completely abolished (<a href=\"#fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Thus, TORC1 is indispensable for the switch to hyperproliferation observed in <i>PTEN</i> mutant tissue upon NR."

Slif function is also required in mitotic tissues, as clones in which <i>Slif</i> has been knocked down (<i>Slif</i><sup><i>anti</i></sup>) are reduced in size, possibly due to reduced TORC1 activation. Since TORC1 is required for the overgrowth of <i>PTEN</i> clones, knocking down <i>Slif</i> should suppress this phenotype in a similar way as observed for <i>Tsc1/2</i> overexpression. Whereas expressing <i>Slif</i><sup><i>anti</i></sup> in <i>PTEN</i> clones resulted in a slight reduction of the mutant tissue under normal conditions, it caused a nearly complete elimination of the <i>PTEN</i> mutant tissue under starvation conditions, while not affecting the control clones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The loss of <i>PTEN</i> mutant tissue was accompanied by a massive increase in apoptosis, and GFP-positive (and thus <i>PTEN</i> mutant) cellular remnants were scattered throughout the disc (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), suggesting that <i>PTEN</i> clones collapsed after an initial overgrowth. Indeed, early overgrowth of <i>PTEN</i> clones and high P-PKB signals were observed under starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> upper panel). Later, <i>Slif</i> function became limiting in <i>PTEN</i> clones that were subsequently eliminated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a> lower panel). Intriguingly, the structure of the resulting adult eyes that had lost the <i>PTEN</i> clones was completely normal, indicating that the surrounding tissue was able to compensate for the loss of the clones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,D\u2032</a>). The effects that the reduction of Slimfast exerted on <i>PTEN</i> clones are distinct from those resulting from inhibiting TORC1 function, as overexpression of <i>Tsc1/2</i> suppressed the overgrowth of <i>PTEN</i> clones already at an early stage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). This may indicate that, rather than the activation of TORC1, another aspect of Slif function\u2014probably the amino acid influx itself\u2014is critical for the survival of the <i>PTEN</i> mutant tissue."

Comparing the P-PKB levels in the heterozygous and wild-type tissue revealed a reduction in the tissue surrounding <i>PTEN</i> clones as compared to tissue adjacent to control clones. Furthermore, cells neighboring with <i>PTEN</i> mutant tissue are smaller than those in the discs containing control clones. Thus, <i>PTEN</i> clones impact on IIS activity in the surrounding tissue, thereby reducing its growth potential. This appears to be sufficient to explain the strong reduction of the surrounding tissue, since the process of ousting the neighboring tissue is completed as early as 60 hr after clonal induction, when the disc still contains relatively few cells. This non-autonomous growth reduction is not restricted to the local neighbors in a cell\u2013cell contact-dependent manner, but rather affects all tissues of the organism."

Under starvation, the circulating levels of growth factors and nutrients are strongly reduced, and thereby can become limiting (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>). <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like peptides (DILPs) produced by the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the brain stimulate the growth of imaginal disc cells via the InR. Starvation reduces the secretion of DILPs from the IPCs, and thus reduces growth (<a href=\"#bib15\">Geminard et al., 2009</a>). Removing <i>InR</i> function in <i>PTEN</i> clones only mildly affects the overgrowth. Thus, despite lacking the signal input via InR, these cells are able to accumulate PIP3, probably because of the basal activity of PI3K. Therefore, low levels of circulating DILPs are sufficient to boost PIP3 levels and PKB activity in <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells under starvation."

We show that, in contrast to inhibiting TORC1 activity, reducing Slif does not block the initial overgrowth of <i>PTEN</i> clones under starvation. However, it causes the overgrown clones to collapse. We speculate that the high metabolic demands of <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells require an efficient amino acid uptake, which is blocked by reducing Slif. Thus, <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells rely on their ability to efficiently compete for nutrients and growth factors under starvation conditions with their direct neighbors and the peripheral tissue. Since the reduction of Slif affects the growth of the wild-type and the <i>PTEN</i> mutant tissue in a differential manner, this amino acid transporter could represent a target for a dosage-dependent drug therapy of tumors with PI3K activation."

The loss of <i>PTEN</i> function triggers high PIP3 levels, thereby activating PKB and TORC1, thus stimulating cell growth and division. Under starvation conditions, circulating growth factors and nutrients are scarce. In response to these limited resources, both wild-type and <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells adjust their growth with respect to cellular size. In sharp contrast to wild-type clones, <i>PTEN</i> clones retain high PI3K activity and strongly increase their cell number. This hyperplastic clonal overgrowth depends on withdrawing nutrients from the neighborhood and ultimately the entire organism. The active scavenging of resources is dependent on efficient amino acid transporters (Slif), which also ensure that TORC1 remains active. During their entire growth, cells are at the brink of death as evidenced by the high apoptosis rate within the <i>PTEN</i> clones. Thus, enhanced PIP3 levels in cells that lost the tumor suppressor PTEN not only leads to starvation resistance at the cellular level, but also suppresses growth in their direct tissue neighborhood and in peripheral tissues by competing for nutrients and growth factors. Our findings demonstrate how limiting nutrient conditions enhance the proliferative potential of <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells, independent of additional genetic alterations."

It has been reported that the concentrations of alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine decrease upon acute starvation (Anaplastic lymphoma kinase spares organ during nutrient restriction in <i>Drosophila,</i> <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>). In our experiment, only two of them, isoleucine and valine, exhibited the same tendency, whereas the concentration of alanine, the most abundant amino acid, even increased upon starvation. Leucine levels were not considerably affected. The results of a representative experiment are shown below in Author response image 1. The discrepancies may be a consequence of the differences in the experimental setups. In our experiment, we subjected the larvae to chronic starvation instead of acute starvation. We checked the changes at the end of a long-term process, which may no longer reflect the situation at the beginning of the starvation. It is also conceivable that changes in amino acid concentrations occur rather locally and not in the systemic pool in the hemolymph."

We dissected fat bodies of the tightly staged larvae (egg laying for 5 hours) with <i>PTEN</i> mutant and control eye discs early in the third instar (72 h under standard conditions and 120 h under starvation conditions) to avoid any changes in gene expression associated with the metamorphosis processes taking place in the fat body. mRNA levels in fat bodies were determined by qRT-PCR.

We attempted to genetically starve the larvae in order to mimic the starvation response in the animals. To this end, we systemically dampened IIS by ubiquitously expressing Imp-L2, a secreted antagonist of Dilp2 (by means of <i>arm-Gal4).</i> In this context, <i>PTEN</i> mutant clones did overgrow more, which was accompanied by a further reduction in body size. Thus, <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells compete with the surrounding normal cells for pools of systemic growth factors, and a systemic reduction in IIS enhances the overgrowth of <i>PTEN</i> mutant tissue. Closer analysis of the overgrown eyes by SEM revealed that cells devoid of PTEN reacted to systemically decreased IIS by slightly reducing their size, but a massive increase in cell number caused the net overgrowth. Thus, systemically decreasing IIS enhances the proliferative potential of <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells.

Cells devoid of Tsc1 are overgrowing under starvation conditions, similar to <i>PTEN</i> mutant cells. However, a thorough analysis revealed significant differences between <i>PTEN</i> and <i>Tsc1</i> clones. As this story is rather complex, we did not want to include it in the present manuscript."
