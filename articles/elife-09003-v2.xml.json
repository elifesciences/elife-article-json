Here, to identify small molecule sumoylation inhibitors we developed a cell-based screen that focused on the well-sumoylated substrate, human Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (hLRH-1, NR5A2). Our primary gene-expression screen assayed two SUMO-sensitive transcripts, <i>APOC3</i> and <i>MUC1</i>, that are upregulated by SUMO-less hLRH-1 or by siUBC9 knockdown, respectively. A polyphenol, tannic acid (TA) emerged as a potent sumoylation inhibitor in vitro (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.8 \u00b5M) and in cells. TA also increased hLRH-1 occupancy on SUMO-sensitive transcripts. Most significantly, when tested in humanized mouse primary hepatocytes, TA inhibits hLRH-1 sumoylation and induces SUMO-sensitive genes, thereby recapitulating the effects of expressing SUMO-less hLRH-1 in mouse liver. Our findings underscore the benefits of phenotypic screening for targeting post-translational modifications, and illustrate the potential utility of TA for probing the cellular consequences of sumoylation."

Here, to identify small molecule sumoylation inhibitors we developed a cell-based screen that focused on the well-sumoylated substrate, human Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (hLRH-1, NR5A2). Our primary gene-expression screen assayed two SUMO-sensitive transcripts, <i>APOC3</i> and <i>MUC1</i>, that are upregulated by SUMO-less hLRH-1 or by siUBC9 knockdown, respectively. A polyphenol, tannic acid (TA) emerged as a potent sumoylation inhibitor in vitro (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.8 \u00b5M) and in cells. TA also increased hLRH-1 occupancy on SUMO-sensitive transcripts. Most significantly, when tested in humanized mouse primary hepatocytes, TA inhibits hLRH-1 sumoylation and induces SUMO-sensitive genes, thereby recapitulating the effects of expressing SUMO-less hLRH-1 in mouse liver. Our findings underscore the benefits of phenotypic screening for targeting post-translational modifications, and illustrate the potential utility of TA for probing the cellular consequences of sumoylation."

SUMO is one such tag that can reversibly attach to proteins and alter their activity. The modification of proteins by SUMO is known as sumoylation, and it regulates many processes that are essential for living cells. In particular, transcription factors\u2014the proteins that bind to DNA to switch genes on or off\u2014are highly modified by SUMO. However, the consequences of sumoylation are not fully understood, and current research into this area has been hindered by a lack of effective and non-toxic chemicals that stop or slow down sumoylation."

This protein, which is referred to as LRH-1 for short, is an ideal candidate to test SUMO inhibitors because it is highly modified by multiple SUMO tags."

Similar to other ubiquitin-like modifications, the sumoylation cycle is multi-stepped, as reviewed in <a href=\"#bib18\">Gareau and Lima (2010</a>), and is initiated by E1 (SAE1), which forms a thioester bond with either SUMO-1, 2, or 3. The single E2 (UBC9) facilitates the hand-off and covalent conjugation of SUMO on a given protein substrate. Although E3s are believed to guide substrate selectivity in cells, only E1 and E2 are required for in vitro sumoylation (IVS). Sumoylation is then reversed by sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs)."

Our lab and others find that sumoylation represents an important, ligand-independent mode to regulate the NR5A nuclear receptor subfamily that includes Steroidogenic Factor 1 (NR5A1/SF-1) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2005</a>) and Liver Receptor Homolog 1 (NR5A2/LRH-1) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chalkiadaki and Talianidis, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stein et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Venteclef et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ward et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yang et al., 2009</a>). For instance, knocking-in an unsumoylatable or SUMO-less mutant SF-1 allele leads to profound changes in endocrine physiology and tissue development (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2011a</a>). Importantly, even in the presence of one wild-type (WT) allele, the phenotypic effects of SUMO-less SF-1 dominate. Mechanistically, we find that SUMO-less SF-1 can regulate select downstream targets, which we refer to as SUMO-sensitive (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell et al., 2008</a>). Indeed, sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is ectopically activated after expressing SUMO-less SF-1 in both cells and tissues. This gain-of-function or dominance of the SUMO-less SF-1 mutant leads to expansion of select cell types and hormone imbalance, illustrating how disrupting the normal cycle of substrate sumoylation results in disease states. Consistent with our findings, gain-of-function heterozygous missense mutations in the sumoylation site of the transcription factor microphthalmia-associated transcription factor are tightly linked with some forms of human melanoma (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertolotto et al., 2011</a>). SUMO-less variants of the androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid hormone (GR) receptors are also reported to activate new transcriptional programs linked to cellular proliferation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Paakinaho et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sutinen et al., 2014</a>). These studies suggest that successful efforts to chemically target substrate sumoylation could be used to alter transcription factor activity, to either promote or attenuate SUMO-sensitive genetic programs."

An in situ cell-based screen in permeabilized, fixed cells partially overcomes this limitation but still requires the addition of exogenous SUMO components for the assay (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hirohama et al., 2013</a>). Currently, inhibitors that target E1 include ginkgolic acid (GA), davidiin, and kerriamycin B. Inhibitors of UBC9 include 2-D08, GSK145A, and spectomycin B1.

Similar to our prior results obtained with SF-1, hLRH-1 is efficiently sumoylated (~30%) in human placental choriocarcinoma JEG3 and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells expressing Flag-hLRH-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Importantly, multiple sumoylated hLRH-1 species are readily detected with only the endogenous SUMOylation machinery and without the need to add exogenous SUMO or UBC9. Substituting lysines K192 and K270 with arginines (K192R/K270R or 2KR) eliminates nearly all sumoylated LRH-1 species, as previously noted (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chalkiadaki and Talianidis, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yang et al., 2009</a>) and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>.

By contrast, expressing SUMO-less hLRH-1 (2KR) eliminates nearly all hLRH-1 sumoylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These collective data establish that hLRH-1 is robustly sumoylated in several platforms, making it an excellent test substrate for assessing both the biochemical and functional effects of small molecule inhibitors of sumoylation."

The JEG3 cell line was initially chosen because it performed well in all steps of the primary screen and has been used previously to study NR5A activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell et al., 2008</a>). Profiling was carried out on JEG3 cells stably expressing hLRH-1 or the SUMO-less hLRH-1 mutant, or after siRNA knock down of UBC9 (siUBC9) to identify the most robust SUMO-sensitive genes. To ensure that minor sumoylation on hLRH-1 was eliminated we used the 3KR mutant that disrupts K44, as well as the two major acceptor lysines in the hinge region. Two genes, <i>APOC3</i> and <i>MUC1</i>,were identified by microarray as the readout transcripts for the screen. These genes are highly induced by either SUMO-less LRH-1 or siUBC9 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and were chosen as two SUMO-sensitive genes in the primary screen assay. Interestingly, <i>APOC3</i> can be directly regulated by LRH-1 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hwang-Verslues and Sladek, 2008</a>), whereas <i>MUC1</i> is regulated by the androgen receptor (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rajabi et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, expression of a well-known NR5A downstream target gene, <i>CYP11A1</i> is unaffected by both SUMO-less LRH-1 and siUBC9 knockdown and is thus designated as a SUMO-insensitive LRH-1 target (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

We then asked if hLRH-1 sumoylation is required to observe the stimulatory effects of TA on <i>APOC3</i> and <i>MUC1</i>. As expected, TA had no effect on <i>CYP11A1</i> regardless of the hLRH-1 variant tested (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). On the other hand, the dose-dependent effects of TA on <i>APOC3</i> are lost when tested with the SUMO-less hLRH-1 (3KR), demonstrating that activation of <i>APOC3</i> by TA depends on the ability of hLRH-1 to be sumoylatable. Further, <i>APOC3</i> upregulation by TA depends on hLRH-1; TA failed to change <i>APOC3</i> alone (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

When compared to a nontoxic dose of GA (10 \u00b5M) or 2-D08, TA is much more efficient at decreasing levels of sumoylated hLRH-1 and shows little cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells after longer exposure times (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We also directly compared the effects of TA versus knockdown of UBC9 (siUBC9) on hLRH-1 and other sumoylated proteins in HepG2 cells. Surprisingly, despite a substantial loss of UBC9 transcripts (95%) and protein (60%) following siRNA-mediated knockdown for 72\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), hLRH-1 remained fully sumoylated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). On the other hand, levels of hLRH-1 sumoylation decreased in a dose-dependent manner\u00a0with\u00a0TA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).The higher migrating sumoylated hLRH-1 species in HepG2 cells that diminish with TA were authenticated as SUMO1 or SUMO2 species (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Interestingly, 1x-Su-hLRH-1 appears to be exclusively modified by SUMO1, whereas higher Su-hLRH-1 species are modified by SUMO2. Both siUBC9 and TA inhibit global sumoylation, but in this setting, siUBC9 is slightly more effective (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). As expected, neither TA nor siUBC9 changes the pool of ubiquitinated proteins. Lastly, we wanted to know if TA similarly modulates sumoylation of endogenously expressed LRH-1. Unfortunately, our ability to cleanly detect or efficiently pulldown endogenous sumoylated LRH-1 species in cells/tissues is difficult with available anti-LRH-1 antibodies, including both commercial and non-commercial sources. Instead, we used human adrenal carcinoma H295R cells that express high levels of endogenous hSF-1 and found that similar to exogenously expressed hLRH-1, TA decreases levels of sumoylated hSF-1 in H295S cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Similar results were also obtained for endogenous RanGap (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Taken together, these data show that TA is a nontoxic potent global sumoylation inhibitor."

Of the 42 genes in this small subset, we\u00a0identified\u00a0three genes that were considered SUMO-sensitive and also found to be putative LRH-1 target genes by ChIP-Seq analyses (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Source data 2</a>), <i>CYP24A1, PFKFB3</i> and <i>SERPINE1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A, B</a>).

We reasoned that assessing transcriptional endpoints makes it possible to integrate other mechanisms that promote substrate-specific sumoylation or desumoylation, including possible synergistic effects of multiple transcription factor sumoylation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Holmstrom et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Komatsu et al., 2004</a>).\u00a0Several factors make hLRH-1 an excellent test substrate in initial and follow-up assays. First, our earlier work established that blocking the NR5A sumoylation cycle results in robust transcriptional changes that could be leveraged in a phenotypic screen.\u00a0Second, hLRH-1 is well-sumoylated with a stereotypic pattern of multiple sumoylated species requiring only the endogenous sumoylation machinery\u00a0when it\u00a0is\u00a0expressed in HEK293S, JEG3, and HepG2 cells, in primary hepatocytes and in liver\u00a0tissue. These findings differ from the need for exogenous SUMO1/2 and E3s required to detect 1x-sumoylated V5-tagged mLRH-1 in HEK293 cells or primary hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stein et al., 2014</a>). In addition, when compared to hFXR, another sumoylated hepatic NR, the number and intensity of hLRH-1 sumoylated species far exceed the faint, single FXR sumoylated band detected when hFXR is expressed in mouse liver (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). Finally,\u00a0the\u00a0pattern of\u00a0hLRH-1\u00a0sumoylation\u00a0is readily duplicated in vitro, allowing one to also test candidate sumoylation modulators in a defined cocktail. We posit that NR5As might be particularly good substrates for sumoylation because their major acceptor lysines reside in the flexible hinge domain, possibly promoting strong protein\u2013protein interactions previously observed between Ubc9 and both SF-1 and LRH-1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, the residual UBC9 protein following siUBC9 knockdown\u00a0likely accounts for the persistent levels of 1x\u00a0SU-LRH-1 and suggests that once UBC9 is charged with SUMO1/2, sumoylation of hLRH-1 proceeds efficiently. Interestingly, as with siUBC9, inhibiting E2 by 2-D08 is also ineffective at blocking hLRH-1 sumoylation. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms that confer relatively high basal levels of NR5A sumoylation in cells and in tissues, the consistent and robust sumoylation observed for hLRH-1 were instrumental in facilitating follow-up studies on candidate small molecule hits from our primary screen."

When compared to other sumoylation inhibitors TA performs well. Indeed, in our IVS assay conditions, TA is more effective than either\u00a02-D08 or GA and can inhibit sumoylation of multiple substrates in vitro, including the\u00a0hinge-LBD of\u00a0SF-1, an\u00a0androgen receptor peptide, and full-length I\u03baB\u03b1. The fact that 2-D08\u00a0fails to\u00a0inhibit hLRH-1 sumoylation but is effective on other substrates (AR peptide and FL-I\u03baB\u03b1) might reflect the fact that 2-D08 fails to block the strong interactions between Ubc9 and NR5As, as mentioned above. These data imply that mechanistically distinct sumoylation inhibitors act on different classes of substrates. We also find that unlike GA, which decreases cell viability as shown here and reported by (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu and Zeng, 2009</a>), TA appears to be well-tolerated in both immortalized and primary cell cultures. Hence, while GA might decrease sumoylation as an adaptive response to cell death, the utility of GA in assessing the transcriptional responses of substrate sumoylation is potentially quite limiting."

The known aggregate formation and antioxidant properties of TA appear to be less important in inhibiting substrate sumoylation. Indeed, TA inhibits FL-hLRH-1 sumoylation even in the presence of detergent. Polyphenols, including TA, are also antioxidants and can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yazawa et al., 2006</a>), which might also directly affect the equilibrium between sumoylation-desumoylation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bossis and Melchior, 2006</a>). In this regard, we find that two other antioxidants, ellagic acid and EGCG, are ineffective at inhibiting hLRH-1 sumoylation (data not shown). Furthermore, conditions in our IVS assays are highly reducing making it unlikely that TA inhibits LRH-1 sumoylation via its antioxidant properties in this setting."

Interestingly, TA is more effective at blocking hLRH-1 sumoylation in primary hepatocytes as compared to HepG2 cells where 1x SUMO-hLRH-1 persists even at the highest dose of TA; a similar trend was noted for endogenous hSF-1 in H295R cells. The lower efficacy of TA in immortalized cell lines may reflect an increase in the general sumoylation machinery in immortalized versus primary cells, as noted by (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bellail et al., 2014</a>). The use of humanized mouse hepatocytes and the dramatic changes we\u00a0observed\u00a0in <i>adiponectin</i> and <i>sonic hedgehog</i> transcripts may begin to provide new insights into the in vivo function of LRH-1 sumoylation. The ectopic activation of SHH signaling observed here in primary hepatocytes after overexpressing SUMO-less hLRH-1 and after\u00a0TA treatment confirms our earlier work showing that elimination\u00a0of SF-1 sumoylation activates hedgehog signaling in endocrine tissues (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2011a</a>). Others have noted that hyperactivation of hedgehog signaling in liver is associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) progression and responses to liver injury (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grzelak et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Guy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hirsova and Gores, 2015</a>). Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived protein that reduces fatty liver (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xu et al., 2003</a>) and appears protective against NASH (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asano et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, while <i>adiponectin</i> is normally never expressed in liver, hepatic <i>adiponectin</i> transcripts are observed in rats after chemically induced hepatotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yoda-Murakami et al., 2001</a>) and in patients with fatty liver or fully progressed NASH (<a href=\"#bib55\">Uribe et al., 2008</a>). The finding that SUMO-less hLRH-1 and TA switch on hepatic <i>adiponectin</i> and hedgehog signaling leads us to speculate that tipping the balance of the hLRH-1 sumoylation cycle toward desumoylation might\u00a0initiate adaptive responses to liver injury, and eventually a pro-inflammatory response, as suggested by others (<a href=\"#bib56\">Venteclef et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, a global knock-in of a single SUMO mutation (K289R) in mouse LRH-1, which is equivalent to K270R in hLRH-1, has no strong\u00a0phenotype on its own, but mitigates aortic plaque formation in <i>Ldlr</i><sup>-/-</sup> arteriosclerosis-prone mice (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stein et al., 2014</a>). Hence, revealing the full physiological consequences of LRH-1 sumoylation could require the elimination of both major sumoylation sites in the flexible hinge domain and the use of conditional knock-in strategies that are specific for the adult liver."

Based on our collective studies that have focused on the sumoylation of NR5As, we propose that the ratio of sumoylated to desumoylated substrate can be chemically manipulated to switch on and off sumo-sensitive transcriptional programs. Clearly, continued efforts are needed to determine whether more selective chemical tools can be found that promote or block sumoylation of a given substrate."

Proteins were visualized using LiCor Odyssey system and goat anti-mouse 800 (1:20,000 LiCor, Pierce,\u00a0Lincoln,\u00a0NE) and quantitated by Image Studio Lite. Percent conversion was calculated by the ratio of sumoylated protein over total signal per reaction normalized to DMSO control. Concentration curves were derived from at least three independent reactions and fit with nonlinear fitting of log<sub>10</sub> [\u00b5M TA] versus variable slope using Prism graphing software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). IVS of full-length I\u03baB\u03b1 and fluorescent AR peptide was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). Conditions for the thioester assay were as described above, but with only E1 and SUMO1 proteins added to IVS reactions."

Final data compilation includes a total of 3.36, 10.77, and 7.7 million aligned sequence reads for WT hLRH-1 and 2.67 million reads from Input. Quality control and ChIP-signal strength assessment was performed via CHANCE (<a href=\"#bib12\">Diaz et al., 2012</a>). CHANCE called both experiments as successful (via a comparison with the distribution of ChIP-strengths observed in the ENCODE repository) at a combined, positive false discovery rate (FDR) of FDR = 2.1X10<sup>-4</sup> for WT hLRH1. Reads from replicates were then pooled, and peaks were called via MACS (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>), using the default parameter settings. This generated 18,884 peaks from the wthLRH-1 samples.

SiRNA-mediated knockdown over 72 h resulted in a 95% loss of <i>UBC9</i> transcripts, with a 60% decrease in UBC9 protein (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5 \u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This residual UBC9 protein likely accounts for the persistent levels of 1xSU-LRH-1 and SU-RanGap. Further, for both SF-1/LRH-1, UBC9 was one of the strongest interacting protein partners (Lee, Mol Cell Biol. 2005). Thus, it is likely that once UBC9 is charged with SUMO1/2, sumoylation of LRH-1 proceeds efficiently. Interestingly, targeting E2 by 2-D08 or by siUBC9 appears to be ineffective at eliminating sumoylation of LRH-1, whereas targeting E1 through TA is much more effective. We also found that depleting 1x-SU-LRH- in HepG2 and JEG3 cells is much more difficult than in primary hepatocytes \u2013 this may reflect inherent differences in the extent of sumoylation between immortalized and primary cells, as suggested by Ballail et al., Nat Comm 2014. Nonetheless, as correctly suggested by the reviewers, and as we discussed in the text, the efficacy of any given sumo-inhibitor is likely substrate-dependent."

By contrast, little toxicity is observed at the highest dose of TA (50-75 \u00b5M) when LRH-1 sumoylation is greatly diminished (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Importantly, at lower non-toxic doses, GA (1 and 10 \u00b5M) is far less effective than TA at inhibiting LRH-1 sumoylation (new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). TA shows little toxicity in primary hepatocytes, even at higher doses. A similar trend was noted for GA when comparing HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes (Ma et al., Oncotarget 2015) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7 \u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Moreover, it is debatable whether one can directly compare the embryonic lethal SUMO1 KO mouse model with GA toxicity and a shut-down of sumoylation. One could easily argue that the embryonic lethality in the developmental SUMO1 KO reflects altered functions of key proteins rather than general toxicity. Furthermore, for our purposes, the confounding toxic effects at doses of GA needed to inhibit sumoylation make it difficult to assess cellular readouts, such as gene expression."
