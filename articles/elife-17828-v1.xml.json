In this study, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP), which has a well-known role in FASII, plays an unexpected and evolutionarily conserved role in FeS biogenesis. ACP is a stable and essential subunit of the eukaryotic FeS biogenesis complex. In the absence of ACP, the complex is destabilized resulting in a profound depletion of FeS throughout the cell. This role of ACP depends upon its covalently bound 4\u2019-phosphopantetheine (4-PP)-conjugated acyl chain to support maximal cysteine desulfurase activity. Thus, it is likely that ACP is not simply an obligate subunit but also exploits the 4-PP-conjugated acyl chain to coordinate mitochondrial fatty acid and FeS biogenesis."

In this study, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP), which has a well-known role in FASII, plays an unexpected and evolutionarily conserved role in FeS biogenesis. ACP is a stable and essential subunit of the eukaryotic FeS biogenesis complex. In the absence of ACP, the complex is destabilized resulting in a profound depletion of FeS throughout the cell. This role of ACP depends upon its covalently bound 4\u2019-phosphopantetheine (4-PP)-conjugated acyl chain to support maximal cysteine desulfurase activity. Thus, it is likely that ACP is not simply an obligate subunit but also exploits the 4-PP-conjugated acyl chain to coordinate mitochondrial fatty acid and FeS biogenesis."

All mitochondria contain a protein called acyl carrier protein (ACP), which cells need in order to live. The ACP protein has a number of known roles including manufacturing the molecules that make up certain fats and helping to organise other proteins that are important for energy production. However, neither of these roles explain why yeast cells require ACP because the other proteins required for these processes are not required for survival."

The experiments show that this interaction is needed to produce iron sulfur clusters, and without it the other proteins involved in the process are not able to work together. Since iron sulfur clusters are essential for life, this could explain why cells cannot survive without ACP. Van Vranken et al. also showed that ACP is only able to efficiently produce iron sulfur clusters when a chemical called a \u201c4-PP-conjugated acyl chain\u201d is attached to it."

Unlike the cytosolic fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FASI), the mitochondrial FASII system, which is homologous to the prokaryotic fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, utilizes a set of monofunctional enzymes that interact transiently with ACP to catalyze the initiation and elongation of nascent acyl chains (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hiltunen et al., 2010</a>). To facilitate FASII, ACP utilizes a 4\u2019-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group (4-PP), which is covalently bound to an invariant Ser residue (<a href=\"#bib15\">Majerus et al., 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Stuible et al., 1998</a>). As such, ACP serves as a soluble scaffold for acyl intermediates during the stepwise process of <i>de novo</i> fatty acid synthesis. Currently, it is thought that the primary product of ACP-dependent FASII is octanoate, which is cleaved from ACP and further processed to generate lipoic acid. Lipoic acid is an obligate cofactor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes as well as the branched chain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase and glycine cleavage complex (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hiltunen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brody et al., 1997</a>). In addition, a FASII-derived acyl chain other than lipoic acid is required for RNase P function in tRNA maturation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Schonauer et al., 2008</a>)."

Indeed, proteomic and structural studies have demonstrated that ACP is a stable accessory subunit of mitochondrial respiratory Complex I (CI) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Sackmann et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Angerer et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, the pool of ACP associated with CI contains a 4-PP-conjugated 3-hydroxymyristic acid, however, the functional importance of this 14-carbon acyl chain has never been investigated in the context of CI activity or assembly (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carroll et al., 2003</a>)."

FASII, which is dependent on ACP, is comprised of a set of monofunctional enzymes that catalyze the various steps in fatty acid synthesis. In order to facilitate mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis, apo-ACP must first be converted to holo-ACP by a 4\u2019-phosphopanthetheine transferase (Ppt2), which catalyzes the covalent attachment of the 4-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group (4-PP) to an absolutely conserved Ser residue on ACP. The 4-PP contains a terminal thiol that serves as the attachment site to enable Acp1 to scaffold <i>de novo</i> fatty acid synthesis. The enzymes of FASII use malonyl-coA to initiate the fatty acid chain and acetyl-coA for acyl chain elongation. The canonical product of FASII is octanoate, which is the precursor for lipoic acid, an important mitochondrial cofactor.

We were particularly intrigued by the co-purification of three subunits of the ISU complex\u2014Nfs1, Isd11, and Isu1\u2014each of which is required for FeS biogenesis and essential for viability. The cysteine desulfurase (Nfs1) and Isd11 form the core of the ISU complex and catalyze the conversion of cysteine to alanine thereby generating a persulfide intermediate, which is the source of sulfide ions that combine with ferrous iron on the Isu1 scaffold protein to form [2Fe-2S] clusters (<a href=\"#bib10\">Garland et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">M\u00fchlenhoff et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Wiedemann et al., 2006</a>). To confirm these interactions, we immunoprecipitated Acp1-HA from isolated mitochondria and analyzed the eluates by immunoblot. Indeed, Nfs1, Isd11, and Isu1 all specifically co-immunoprecipitate with Acp1, although Isu1 appears to interact less avidly than Nfs1 or Isd11 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition to SDS-PAGE, the resultant eluates were also resolved by blue native (BN)-PAGE, which demonstrated that Acp1 co-purifies with the intact core Nfs1-Isd11 complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Finally, Nfs1-V5 and Isd11-V5 were each immunoprecipitated from isolated mitochondria. As expected, Acp1-HA was detected in the eluates of each immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results are further supported by proteomics-based interaction studies, which identify human ACP, NFS1, and ISD11 as mutually interacting proteins in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Huttlin et al., 2015</a>). Taken together these data demonstrate that Acp1 is a stable and evolutionarily conserved subunit of the ISU complex with Nfs1, Isd11, and Isu1."

Thus, we hypothesized that the essential function of Acp1 might relate to FeS biogenesis. We engineered inducible <i>ACP1</i> knockdown strains (Acp1<sup>KD</sup>) using two distinct strategies and strain backgrounds\u2014TetO<sub>7-</sub><i>ACP1</i> in the BY4741 background and Gal-<i>ACP1</i> in the DY150 background, in which <i>ACP1</i> expression is suppressed by doxycycline and galactose withdrawal, respectively. As expected, Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells from each background displayed attenuated growth upon <i>ACP1</i> shutdown, which is particularly evident on respiration-requiring glycerol medium (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Importantly, viability could be restored in each of these strains by episomal expression of the Acp1-HA at endogenous levels. In addition to the expected loss of lipoic acid-containing subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells, we also observed a specific destabilization of the FeS-containing subunits of Complex II (Sdh2) and Complex III (Rip1) and loss of those assembled respiratory complexes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). A similar destabilization of these complexes occurs in cells depleted for Nfs1 and Isu1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Wiedemann et al., 2006</a>). Importantly, Complex III biogenesis stalls in Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells at the final stage of assembly \u2013 incorporation of the Rieske FeS protein (Rip1) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; IB: Rip1)\u2013resulting in the accumulation of a stable assembly intermediate of Complex III lacking Rip1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; III<sub>2</sub>*; IB: Qcr7). The presence of the late stage intermediate III<sub>2</sub>* indicates that mitochondrial translation of the Cob cytochrome b subunit is normal in Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atkinson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cui et al., 2012</a>). Likewise, translation of the mitochondrial subunits of ATP synthase is normal as seen by the assembled F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We also observed a loss of activity of aconitase, a mitochondrial enzyme with an obligate FeS cofactor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

In Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells the expression of Aft1-target genes <i>FIT2</i> and <i>FIT3</i> was elevated consistent with impaired mitochondrial FeS synthesis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Rutherford et al., 2005</a>).

Importantly, the Nfs1 and Isd11 protein that remain in these cells is found only in insoluble aggregates in contrast to WT cells where Nfs1 and Isd11 are soluble (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, in the absence of Acp1, the Nfs1-Isd11 complex is destabilized, most likely causing a loss of cysteine desulfurase activity. To determine if mammalian ACP is also necessary for maintaining steady state levels of the FeS biogenesis complex in mammalian cells, C2C12 mouse myoblasts were transfected with a pool of siRNAs targeting <i>NDUFAB1</i> (the gene encoding mammalian ACP) or a control siRNA. While our methods were unable to detect the mammalian Nfs1-Isd11 complex by BN-PAGE, depletion of ACP in these cells was accompanied by a clear destabilization of the subunits of the mammalian FeS biogenesis machinery, NFS1, ISD11, and ISCU2, which is the mammalian version of Isu1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

Like Acp1<sup>KD</sup> cells expressing Acp1<sup>S82A</sup>, the Nfs1-Isd11 complex was severely depleted in <i>ppt2</i>\u0394 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, these cells exhibit a clear diminution in activity of FeS-containing enzymes in both the mitochondria and cytosol as represented by aconitase and sulfite reductase activity, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). We also interrogated the ability of Acp1 to interact with Nfs1 in WT and <i>ppt2</i>\u0394 cells. While the steady state levels of Acp1 are not affected in <i>ppt2</i>\u0394 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), we observed a clear defect in the ability of Acp1 to interact with Nfs1 in this strain (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Therefore, the Acp1-conjugated 4-PP plays an important role in the interaction of Acp1 with the core Nfs1-Isd11 complex and in FeS biogenesis. Importantly, <i>lip5\u0394</i> cells, which cannot synthesize lipoic acid but remain competent for Acp1-dependent fatty acid synthesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hiltunen et al., 2010</a>), maintain normal abundance of the Nfs1-Isd11 complex and aconitase and sulfide reductase activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>). Thus, the defects in FeS biogenesis observed in cells expressing apo-Acp1 are a result of the inability to generate an acyl-conjugated Acp1 species and not a defect in lipoic acid biosynthesis."

ACP functions as a stable subunit of the ISU complex where it acts to stabilize the complex in part by exploiting a 4-PP-conjugated acyl chain. Unlike ACP, however, the acyl chain is not absolutely required for FeS biogenesis and viability, which raises the intriguing possibility that ACP is not simply an obligate subunit, but may exploit this unique interaction modality to provide additional structural or regulatory functions on FeS biogenesis. It is particularly intriguing to speculate that ACP may serve to coordinate mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and FeS biogenesis, which represent two critical biosynthetic processes performed by mitochondria."

Using genetic tools in yeast, the authors demonstrate loss of the ISU complex and FeS biogenesis (specifically OXPHOS complexes II and III subunits), as well as loss of a lipoic acid-containing PDH subunit as expected. Cytosolic FeS-containing systems were also affected and convincingly demonstrated (qPCR of transcripts known to be upregulated upon impaired mito FeS synthesis, activity of cytosolic sulfite reductase). Turnover of mammalian ISU subunits upon knockdown of NDUFAB1 (human ACP) was also demonstrated, suggesting the phenomenon is conserved (however more work will be needed to establish this given the complexities of the dually and now potentially triple localized human ACP, although this is probably out of the scope of this short report). Finally, using a mutant of ACP unable to conjugate the acyl chain, the authors demonstrate its importance in lipoic acid synthesis as expected, as well as FeS biogenesis. Interestingly, cells expressing only ACP unable to conjugate the acyl chain remain viable, suggesting the essentiality of ACP is in fact due to its involvement in FeS biogenesis. Knockout of the enzyme conjugating the acyl chain to ACP had a similar effect. The authors also found that overexpression of a mitochondrial ion transporter and to a lesser extent another subunit of the ISU complex, restored the levels of the ISU complex (and substrates). Taken together the assumption is that the stability of the ISU complex is being impaired or increased respectively, and also that the acyl chain has a primarily structural role in the ISU complex rather than a functional one. This is very nicely controlled report demonstrating a totally unexpected role for ACP in FeS biogenesis."

While this alone does not prove that the S82A mutant achieves a native confirmation, we also know that apo-Acp1 has wild-type stability as it accumulates to the same degree as holo-Acp1 and is fully soluble. Furthermore, it is not completely unable to bind Isd11 and Nfs1. Newly included data demonstrates that apo-Acp1 can still bind the core ISU complex albeit with much reduced affinity. This is consistent with the observations that ACP and ISD11 make protein-protein contacts independent of those mediated by the acylated \u2013PP. Taken together we feel strongly that the defects observed in cells expressing Acp1<sup>S82A</sup>, which mirror the defects seen in <i>ppt2\u0394</i> cells, stem from a failure to make essential cofactor-protein and lipid-protein contacts. So while this does not prove the lack of some misfolding, we feel that the data strongly supports a structural role for the acylated cofactor in the ISU complex. Therefore, we are reluctant to add a statement in the text that we are quite confident is wrong and will be strongly disproven in the next several months with the publication of the structure. However, if the reviewers still feel strongly about this point, we will, of course, include the caveat as a possible interpretation."

In order to further interrogate the defects observed in cells expressing apo-Acp1, Acp1 was immunoprecipitated from WT and <i>ppt2\u0394</i> cells. While Acp1 accumulated to similar extents and was readily soluble in each both strains, Acp1 in <i>ppt2\u0394</i> cells pulled down far less Nfs1 than Acp1 from WT cells. This demonstrates that the 4-PP promotes, but is not absolutely essential, for mediating the Acp1-Nfs1 interaction."
