                    "text": "Synthesis of mRNA in eukaryotes involves the coordinated action of many enzymatic processes, including initiation, elongation, splicing, and cleavage. Kinetic competition between these processes has been proposed to determine RNA fate, yet such coupling has never been observed in vivo on single transcripts. In this study, we use dual-color single-molecule RNA imaging in living human cells to construct a complete kinetic profile of transcription and splicing of the \u03b2-globin gene. We find that kinetic competition results in multiple competing pathways for pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing of the terminal intron occurs stochastically both before and after transcript release, indicating there is not a strict quality control checkpoint. The majority of pre-mRNAs are spliced after release, while diffusing away from the site of transcription. A single missense point mutation (S34F) in the essential splicing factor U2AF1 which occurs in human cancers perturbs this kinetic balance and defers splicing to occur entirely post-release."

Kinetic competition between these processes has been proposed to determine RNA fate, yet such coupling has never been observed in vivo on single transcripts. In this study, we use dual-color single-molecule RNA imaging in living human cells to construct a complete kinetic profile of transcription and splicing of the \u03b2-globin gene. We find that kinetic competition results in multiple competing pathways for pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing of the terminal intron occurs stochastically both before and after transcript release, indicating there is not a strict quality control checkpoint. The majority of pre-mRNAs are spliced after release, while diffusing away from the site of transcription. A single missense point mutation (S34F) in the essential splicing factor U2AF1 which occurs in human cancers perturbs this kinetic balance and defers splicing to occur entirely post-release."

Each of these processes is carried out by megadalton macromolecular complexes acting at a single genetic locus, and kinetic competition between these processes has been proposed to determine RNA fate (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bentley, 2014</a>). Genome-wide studies across organisms indicate heterogeneous distributions of both RNA polymerase and nascent RNA along the gene, suggesting that kinetic checkpoints exist throughout the gene, including at promoter-proximal sites, translation start sites, intron\u2013exon boundaries, and at the 3\u2032 end of genes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Core et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nechaev et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hah et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Larson et al., 2014</a>). However, population studies reflect the balance of kinetic rates and are unable to resolve the multiple competing processes occurring at a single gene. Moreover, genome-wide measurements lack the time-resolution which might provide mechanistic clues about the underlying enzymatic processes."

Kinetic competition during the transcription cycle has been shown to influence splice site selection during alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib24\">de la Mata et al., 2003</a>), recruitment of factors which release promoter-proximal pausing (<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2013</a>), and even RNAi-mediated genome defense (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dumesic et al., 2013</a>). Since these processes occur within the dynamic milieu of the nucleus, the stochastic interactions between macromolecules may result in a range of possible outcomes for the nascent RNA. Stochastic RNA synthesis\u2014the phenomenon whereby the inherently stochastic nature of bio-molecular encounters and reactions leads to a non-deterministic production of transcripts\u2014has been directly visualized in multiple organisms (<a href=\"#bib30\">Golding et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chubb et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yunger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Larson et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2013</a>). Yet, stochastic RNA processing\u2014the possibility that stochastic bio-molecular reactions might lead to non-deterministic pathways/outcomes in the making and maturation of an RNA\u2014has never been directly observed, and the potential consequences for gene regulation are largely unexplored. Alternatively, regulatory checkpoints have been proposed which safeguard against such stochastic RNA processing events, providing a level of quality control. For example, the model of exon definition requires that splicing of the terminal intron relies on synergy between 3\u2032 end formation, nascent RNA cleavage, and intron excision (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berget et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Niwa et al., 1990</a>). Similarly, multiple studies indicate an increased density of nascent RNA present at the 3\u2032 end of genes or in the chromatin-bound fraction, suggesting that nascent RNA is retained at the site of transcription to ensure correct processing (<a href=\"#bib29\">Glover-Cutter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brody et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bhatt et al., 2012</a>). In both the competition model and the checkpoint model, kinetics plays a prominent role, but in the latter case, the cell has developed additional safeguard mechanisms."

The approach is based on simultaneous dual-color imaging of both the intron and exon of the same pre-mRNA using both PP7 and MS2 stem loops (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bertrand et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chao et al., 2008</a>). We find that kinetic competition results in multiple competing pathways for pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing of the terminal intron occurs stochastically both before and after transcript release, indicating there is not a strict quality control checkpoint. Post-release splicing occurs from freely diffusing transcripts in the nucleus and is an order of magnitude faster than splicing at the site of transcription. A single missense mutation (Ser34Phe) in the zinc finger domain of the conserved splicing factor U2AF1 which is recurrent in multiple cancers (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yoshida et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Graubert et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Waterfall et al., 2014</a>) changes the balance, making all splicing post-release. This same effect can also be observed on the endogenous, un-modified fragile X mental retardation mRNA (<i>FXR1</i>). Our results show that kinetic competition governs the stochastic balance between multiple competing pathways for RNA synthesis and processing and that this balance is perturbed by oncogenic mutations."

When the PP7 cassette is transcribed, the red fluorescence signal increases progressively (as RNA stem loops are formed) and plateaus once the polymerase exits the cassette. The same applies to the green fluorescence signal when the PP7 cassette is transcribed. If splicing is post-release, red and green signals drop simultaneously when the unspliced RNA is released and diffuse away. If splicing is pre-release, the red fluorescence drops before the green fluorescence reflecting that intron removal occurred before the release of a spliced transcript."

Autocorrelations decrease linearly and reach 0 at a delay equal to the persistence time of the red and green signals. Cross-correlation shows four angles, each reflecting the delay between a rise or fall in the red signal and a rise or fall in the green signal. (<b>B</b>) This can be generalized to the case where fluorescence signals rise as ramps (spanning the width of each cassette). In this case, the sharp angles described above become smooth when one or two of the fluorescence transitions they involve is a ramp. (<b>C</b>) If the red fall precedes the green rise (i.e., splicing precedes transcription of MS2 cassette), crosscorrelation at \u03c4 = 0 is null because the two signals never overlap. If the red signal falls while the green signal is up (i.e., splicing occurs after the MS2 cassette but before release), crosscorrelation at \u03c4 = 0 is non-null and is increasing with the same slope on either side of the y-axis. Finally, if both signal fall at the same time (i.e., splicing succeeds or coincides with transcript release), the crosscorrelation shows a break of slope at \u03c4 = 0, with a positive slope for \u03c4 &lt; 0 and a null slope for \u03c4 &gt; 0. (<b>D</b>) The correlation functions originating from a heterogeneous (stochastic) population of transcripts is simply the average of the correlation functions for each transcript. Hence, all the pre-release splicing events contribute a positive slope on either site of the y-axis, while all the post-release splicing events only contribute a positive slope on the left side of the axis. The resulting crosscorrelation displays a change of slope that directly reflects the fraction of pre- and post-release splicing events."

The central part of each panel depicts the fluorescence time profiles lined up with the reporter construct, indicating the names of the time distributions of the different sections of the profile (i.e., time the polymerase spends in each region of the construct). The right part of each panel indicates what is assumed in terms of kinetic relationship between splicing (i.e., intron removal), elongation (i.e., progression or pausing), and release (i.e., including some 3\u2032 end processing time or retention on the chromatin). (<b>Scheme I</b>) Splicing never happens pre-release. (<b>Scheme II</b>) Once the 3\u2032 splice site (3\u2032ss) is reached and as long as the RNA is as the transcription site, splicing is kinetically independent from all other processes such as elongation and 3\u2032 end processing/retention. It means that affecting either process will change the balance of post- vs pre-release splicing. (<b>Scheme III</b>) Once the 3\u2032 splice site is reached, an obligatory checkpoint forces the polymerase to pause until the splicing reaction completes. (<b>Scheme IV</b>) The transcript can only be spliced once the 3\u2032 end of the gene is reached. Once the intron is removed, the RNA may be released after an additional processing/retention time. (<b>Scheme V</b>) Splicing may happen any time after the 3\u2032ss is reached but a checkpoint mechanism ensures the RNA is spliced before its release."

If splicing never occurs before transcript release, the intron-to-exon cross-correlation (blue) starts horizontally at positive delays. On the other hand, if splicing always occurs before release, this function starts with a positive slope in alignment with its negative counterpart (magenta). In the case where splicing is stochastic and both outcomes may occur, their relative probability of occurrence is given by the change of slope of the cross-correlation at 0 delay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2D and 3</a>). The experimental cross-correlation determined from \u223c2000 individual \u03b2-globin transcripts indicates that splicing occurs before release for a fraction of transcripts (13 \u00b1 5%, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> inset). We note that this change in slope at short time delay <i>only</i> denotes the relative order of splicing <i>vs</i> release but says nothing about the kinetics of these two processes. In summary, these data demonstrate that splicing and release are not firmly constrained to occur in a specific order (p &lt; 0.003)."

To gain further insight, we developed mathematical models which relate the shape of the correlation functions to the timing of the underlying molecular processes (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We generated five different mechanistic schemes: (I) purely post-release splicing, (II) independence between splicing and elongation/release, (III) polymerase pausing at the 3\u2032 splice site (ss) until splicing is complete, (IV) splicing only during 3\u2032 end retention of the transcript, and (V) release only after splicing is complete (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). For each one of these general schemes, different time distributions were tested for elongation, splicing, and release (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Since by construction, the intron-to-exon cross-correlation at 0 delay is necessarily null in scheme III and have a null slope in scheme I, these two schemes can be ruled out (See <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5A,D</a> for fits). The three other schemes were better at fitting the correlation curves but the best model is one from scheme II, that is where splicing is independent of elongation and transcript release (See <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a> and discussion on <i>Model comparison</i> in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In this 3-parameter model (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), splicing occurs a fixed amount of time after the 3\u2032ss has been transcribed, and transcript release involves a stochastic delay after the poly(A) site is reached. No pause at the 3\u2032 ss was needed to fit the data. This observation does not rule out pausing at these sites but suggests that such a pause would be much shorter than the other timescales observed. Notably, our data are fit better with a model having a fixed time for intron removal rather than a stochastic (exponential) one, arguing for several sequential kinetic steps (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aitken et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schmidt et al., 2011</a>). In total, the \u03b2-globin-terminal intron splicing time was 267 \u00b1 9 s after the polymerase passes the 3\u2032 ss. This measurement of splicing time is consistent with previous estimates either in vivo on cell populations (<a href=\"#bib52\">Singh and Padgett, 2009</a>) or in vitro at the single-molecule level (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that PP7 stem loops do not perturb splicing kinetics of this intron, contrary to MS2 stem loops (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aitken et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schmidt et al., 2011</a>). As an independent validation of our modeling results, we counted the number of red and green RNAs at transcription sites using a normalized ratiometric approach (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zenklusen et al., 2008</a>) (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The average red-to-green ratio of 1.41 is indistinguishable from the expected 1.4 value predicted by our modeling analysis of the correlation functions."

Based on our measurements, splicing occurring at the TS is rarely completed during elongation but rather during a pause at the 3\u2032 end of the gene. Because transcript release is stochastic, the 3\u2032 end dwell time can be shorter or longer than the necessary time to remove the intron, resulting in splicing that can occur either before or after release."

                                "text": "Since the majority of \u03b2-globin pre-mRNA is released from the TS before splicing of the terminal intron, we addressed the question of where and when this splicing takes place. We observed a mobile population of unspliced pre-mRNA (co-localized intron/exon) diffusing in the immediate vicinity of the TS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). In contrast, spliced mRNA (exon only) could be observed diffusing throughout the nucleus. A small population of red-only particles was also recorded, which could be due either to the false-discovery rate of the segmentation algorithm or the presence of free lariats (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The radial distribution of mRNA and pre-mRNA indicated an enrichment for unspliced transcripts within 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m of the TS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), meaning that splicing occurs faster than diffusion throughout the nucleus. This enrichment disappears upon treatment with splicing inhibitor SSA, in which case most of the transcripts are unspliced and dispersed throughout the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). From the measured diffusion coefficient (D = 0.12 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we calculated that post-release splicing takes place on average 13 \u00b1 1 s after departure from chromatin. This time is much shorter than the expected 137 s it would take if pre- and post-release splicing kinetics were identical (calculated from <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). From this observation, it is tempting to speculate that transcripts are released only after they have passed a particular rate-limiting step in spliceosome assembly, explaining why the catalytic step occurs very soon after release. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with the fact that 3\u2032end retention time is not affected by SSA treatment which impairs binding of U2 and hence affects recruitment of all the snRNPs except U1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Corrionero et al., 2011</a>). Note also that we cannot formally exclude the possibility that co-localized intron/exon particles are actually excised introns still in complex with transcripts. In summary, although introns can be retained for over 4 min on chromatin, once the transcript is released, splicing is 10-fold faster for freely diffusing transcripts. In most cases, the nascent intron is retained until transcription reaches the 3\u2032 end of the gene and then removed either before or shortly after release of the transcript (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

After transcription of the 3\u2032 splice site, intron removal takes about 260 s and elongation until the end of the gene, about 55 s. Hence, splicing does not occur during elongation. The transcript is retained at the 3\u2032end of the gene for a stochastic amount of time that can be shorter or longer than the remaining time to excise the intron. This results in two possible outcomes: either an unspliced pre-mRNA is released and then spliced very rapidly or splicing occurs while the transcript is retained on chromatin before being released."

One recurrent change is a heterozygous point mutation in U2 auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1), which is an essential factor for recognition of the AG dinucleotide consensus motif (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The serine-to-phenylalanine (S34F) missense mutation in the zinc finger domain results in disparate changes in alternative splicing patterns including exon skipping, exon inclusion, and alternative 3\u2032 ss selection (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brooks et al., 2014</a>).

Using single-molecule FISH (<a href=\"#bib27\">Femino et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), we examined the spatial distribution of intron and exon in fixed cells transfected with U2AF1 or U2AF1-S34F.

We then performed the same spatial analysis as above, except on fixed cells instead of live cells. Expression of the U2AF1-S34F mutant resulted both in an increase in the level of unspliced pre-mRNA in the nucleus (16.0 \u00b1 0.4% compared to 6.0 \u00b1 0.3%, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) and the radial distance from the TS (1.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcm compared to 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcm, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>).

A minority of transcripts are spliced while retained at the 3\u2032 end of the gene, but the dominant pathway is the one in which splicing is contemporaneous with release or occurs shortly thereafter. These results are consistent with several studies which suggested that intron removal is enhanced upon cleavage (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baur\u00e9n et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bird et al., 2005</a>). In fact, we find that splicing is 10-fold faster on freely diffusing transcripts than on chromatin-bound transcripts. Our data are consistent with a model where commitment to splicing of the terminal \u03b2-globin intron occurs co-transcriptionally but suggest there may be a high energy barrier to completion of intron removal while transcripts are still tethered to chromatin, possibly due to steric constraints. Thus, post-release splicing may be the energetically favored process, but there is a long kinetic window in which the less-favorable pre-release intron removal can occur."

This fundamental kinetic quantity has been elusive. Population-based measurements suggest a splicing time for several endogenous, un-modified introns of 5\u201310 min (<a href=\"#bib52\">Singh and Padgett, 2009</a>). Bulk in vitro measurements on \u03b2-globin indicate a 40- to 50-min timescale. A single-molecule in vitro study on yeast transcripts measured \u223c10-min splicing time. On the opposite end of the spectrum, previous live-cell imaging approaches relying on both direct and indirect measurements indicate splicing times in the order of \u223c30 s (<a href=\"#bib36\">Huranov\u00e1 et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Martin et al., 2013</a>). One of the primary experimental advances in our study is the ability to observe the transcription and splicing process with a time resolution that spans three orders of magnitude. Since the time to splice is a distributed quantity, and splicing times vary from transcript to transcript, the variation in previously reported splicing rates may be strongly influenced by the temporal dynamic range of the method. Biologically, this variability in splicing rate may provide regulatory potential, as we discuss below."

The presence of a delay at the 3\u2032 end may be interpreted as a checkpoint mechanism to ensure that splicing takes place before transcript release, but there are several reasons to reject this interpretation of our data. First, none of the models which assume dependence between splicing and elongation/release fit better than one that assumes independence. Second, both splicing and elongation inhibition experiments support the view of the two processes being kinetically independent. Abolishing splicing with SSA does not lead to an increase in release times. Conversely, reducing elongation speed with CPT does not slow down splicing. Instead, it leads to an increase in pre-release splicing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), as expected if the two processes are independent. Thus, splicing and release can happen in either order, with the order of events determined by kinetic competition. It is this competition which results in stochastic outcomes for the RNA."

Our studies on the mutant U2AF1 provide a mechanistic basis for this observation and suggest a role for mutations in the core splicing machinery for the increased levels of \u2018noisy splicing\u2019 which are observed in cancer (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pickrell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, our time-resolved results indicate that post-release splicing is more efficient than pre-release splicing, which may explain how the timing of intron removal might lead to different outcomes for the message. Such a model relies on a degree of plasticity in spliceosome assembly and function, which has been suggested by in vitro single-molecule measurements (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</a>). We speculate that the kinetic delay induced by U2AF1-S34F allows either for alternate pairing between 5\u2032 and 3\u2032ss during transcription or for post-release reconfiguration of pre-mRNA which is not yet committed to intron excision in the spliceosome. Other pathological RNA processing defects may also originate from a similar kinetic imbalance. In summary, the single-molecule approach developed here provides a blueprint for dissecting the many competing processes which take place at the earliest stages of gene expression."

Briefly, the 3\u2032 end of the human \u03b2-globin sequence was truncated 72 bp upstream of the endogenous stop codon. It was replaced by a cassette coding for the cyan fluorescent protein fused to the peroxisome-targeting sequence serine-lysine-leucine (CFP-SKL), ending with a translation stop codon. A cassette containing 24 repeats of the MS2 stem loop sequence was inserted in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR), followed by a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence (BGH-PolyA). In our modified construct, we inserted a cassette containing 24 repeats of the PP7 stem loop sequence into the second and last intron of the gene, approximately halfway between the 5\u2032 splice site (5\u2032ss) and the branch point. In order to be the least perturbing, the cassette was inserted 463 bp downstream of the 5\u2032ss and 371 bp upstream of the branch point, and most of the endogenous DNA was conserved (8 bp in the intron were deleted). In addition, we replaced the MS2 cassette with one that is less prone to recombination. The repeating units of the PP7 and MS2 cassettes are composed of two-stem loop blocks, which are then multimerized 12\u00d7 to get 24\u00d7 total stem loops:"

Each point of the single-trace correlation functions was given a weight corresponding to the number of overlapping time points from the signals used in its computation. Bootstrapping was performed to obtain standard error of the mean correlation functions (SEM). Two normalizations were performed prior to bootstrapping: (i) Baseline subtraction: Slow processes (e.g. bursting, cell cycle) may produce a slow decay which adds up to the fast transcription/splicing kinetics. These are usually well separated; see how the decay is much slower after 200\u2013300 s on <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013F</a>. The baseline subtraction gets rid of the slow decay, approximating it as a constant offset at short delays. (ii) Normalization with null-delay crosscorrelation G<sub>rg</sub>(0): All 4 correlation functions were normalized using an estimate of G<sub>rg</sub>(0). This was done for 2 reasons: (a) doing this normalization prior to bootstrapping promotes a good convergence of the crosscorrelation at short delays 0 (the most informative part of the correlation functions; See <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>\u2014\u00a72). This constrains the fits to capture precisely the temporal features at short delays. (b) This normalization reduces by 1 the number of free parameters of all the models used to fit the data: On unnormalized correlation functions, changing the initiation rate of transcription simply scales up and down all 4 correlation functions together (See <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>\u2014\u00a71). Normalizing them gets rid of this degree of freedom. Because most of the time G<sub>rg</sub>(0) is inaccurate due to shot noise and/or small tracking error (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,E,F</a>), we use the estimate (G<sub>rg</sub>(\u0394t) + G<sub>gr</sub>(\u0394t))/2 instead (\u0394t = 10 s is the sampling time)."

False positive spots due to nucleoli or localized outside of the nucleus were eliminated using a standard masking procedure. Spots were detected independently in both channels (intron and exon) in 9 videos of 50 frames on average taken with a 3.26 s frame interval. Pairs of red and green spots colocalized by less than 250 nm (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) were hence considered single bi-color particles. The TS was tracked and used as a reference for radial distributions of particles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). These distributions were normalized by the distribution obtained for random locations in the nucleus (i.e., a value of 1 observed indicates a purely uniform distribution). RNAs in the nucleus being relatively sparse, colocalized particles are expected to be mostly true positive, that is unspliced RNAs. On the other hand, a proportion of the red-only and green-only particles may be false positive (e.g., bi-color RNA only detected in one color). mRNAs being much more abundant than pre-mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), green-only spots should only have a small portion of false positives. It is however difficult to estimate what portion of the red-only spots truly represents free lariat and what is a wrong detection/categorization of pre-mRNA. The fact that the red-only radial distributions and the co-localized radial distribution are very similar suggests that red-only spots have a high proportion of false positives (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) and that lariat lifetime is likely shorter than that of post-release pre-mRNA (i.e. &lt; 13 s). Depletion at distances shorter than 1 \u03bcm is due to the difficulty for the spot-localization algorithm to locate two spots closer than this distance. The radial distribution of colocalized red\u2013green spots was fit to a Gaussian distribution with three parameters: standard deviation <i>\u03c3</i>, height <i>h</i>, and baseline <i>y</i><sub><i>0</i></sub> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

Model I.1 is the simplest possible: it assumes that everything is deterministic, that elongation proceeds with a constant speed, and that transcript release is instantaneous. It has a single parameter v, representing the speed of the polymerase. In models I.2, we add an elongation pause between the two cassettes. This can represent a pause anywhere between the cassettes, such as, in particular, right after the 3\u2032 splice site (3\u2032ss). This model has two parameters: the elongation speed v and the mean pause time ps. Model I.3 is constructed similarly by introducing an exponentially distributed pause at the 3\u2032 end of the gene. Model I.4 includes pauses both after the 3\u2032ss and at the 3\u2032 end of the gene."

Models II.1 and II.2 consider a deterministic elongation (equivalent of model I.1) with either a deterministic or a stochastic splicing time. Models II.3 to II.5 include a pause at the 3\u2032ss, at the 3\u2032 end of the gene, or at both (as for models I.2 to I.4), but also include here a deterministic splicing time. Of all the models described so far, the experimental data is best fit by model II.4 where splicing is deterministic and 3\u2032 end dwell time exponential. Hence, we generated three other closely related models: II.6 where splicing is exponential and 3\u2032 end dwell time deterministic, II.7 where both are exponential, and II.8 where 3\u2032 end dwell time is exponential and splicing follows a gamma distribution."

Once splicing happens, release of the transcript may require an extra time (distribution <i>F</i>(<i>t</i>)). In models IV.1 to IV.3, when the polymerase reaches the termination site, splicing occurs either immediately (IV.1), or after an exponentially (IV.2) or gamma distributed (IV.3) delay. Then, the RNA is released after an exponentially distributed time (e.g., for additional 3\u2032 end processing). These three cases correspond to a checkpoint mechanism that holds the splicing process respectively at its last biochemical step, or at 1 or several steps prior to its completion. In this scheme, RNAs cannot be released unspliced. So the only possibility for <i>G</i><sub><i>rg</i></sub>(0) to show both a break of slope and a rising slope at 0<sup>+</sup> would be that splicing and release occur simultaneously for a fraction of the transcripts. Hence, we built model IV.4 which is similar to model IV.2 except that, for a fraction of the transcripts, release is immediate after splicing. This corresponds to a mechanism where both splicing and RNA 3\u2032-end processing take (independent) exponential times after the termination site is reached, but the RNA is only released when both processes have come to completion."

This is an important issue for understanding the coupling of these reactions and an area of substantial interest in the field. The authors use single molecule imaging of a tagged beta-globin RNA substrate carrying fluorescent labels in an intron and the 3' exon to follow the appearance and disappearance of the two labels in living cells. They develop a new and elegant analysis that applies correlation spectroscopy to the intron and exon signals to extract reaction rates for transcriptional elongation, splicing, and release from the gene locus. As seen by others, they find that some splicing occurs at the locus and some after release. Using inhibitors to alter the rates of either transcription or splicing, they show that these rates are essentially independent of each other. They find that there is a significant delay between the time of transcript completion and its release from the locus, with the fraction of splicing seen at the locus in kinetic competition with the elongation and release rates. The intron containing transcripts that are released from the locus appear to be very rapidly spliced as measured in relation to their diffusion from the site of transcription. Finally, the authors present interesting experiments using their system to analyze the effects of a dominant mutation in the U2AF1 splicing factor. U2AF1 mutations have recently been implicated in myelodysplastic syndromes, and the authors show that expression of the mutant factor significantly delays splicing to be mostly after release from the locus."

Describing the process as a kinetic competition was more apt, but this should be more clearly defined earlier in the paper as a competition between the splicing rate and the combined elongation and release rates."

Brody et al and others have described polyA RNA at the locus and the authors here describe a significant dwell time after the 3' end is synthesized. Thus, at least some of the splicing at the locus is presumably taking place on transcriptionally complete RNAs. Making this clearer would avoid confusing constructions like: \u201cco-transcriptional splicing is rarely completed during elongation\u201d. Similarly, the authors seem to imply in places that 3' cleavage is occurring at the time of release. This is not shown and there is data from others to indicate it may at the beginning of the dwell time not the end. Since single molecule transcription experiments in vitro do not show delayed release, the authors might discuss what the delayed release in vivo might mean. Paused polymerase prior to the poly-A site, the need to pass some stage in maturation prior to release, a process that anchors material close to a locus that is absent from an in vitro system, or some other possibility?"

In stochastic transcription, events such as a gene switching ON and OFF are stochastic but still have a definable rate. The non-deterministic outcome is the amount of a given RNA in a cell over time. Similarly, in RNA synthesis and processing, events are stochastic and also occur at a definable rate. The non-deterministic outcome is the pathway taken to go from nascent pre-mRNA to mRNA. The simple fact that our data cannot be described by a deterministic model indicates that, by definition, RNA processing is stochastic."

Although this usage is seen in other papers, it is not strictly correct. Brody et al and others have described polyA RNA at the locus and the authors here describe a significant dwell time after the 3' end is synthesized. Thus, at least some of the splicing at the locus is presumably taking place on transcriptionally complete RNAs. Making this clearer would avoid confusing constructions like: \u201cco-transcriptional splicing is rarely completed during elongation\u201d. Similarly, the authors seem to imply in places that 3' cleavage is occurring at the time of release. This is not shown and there is data from others to indicate it may at the beginning of the dwell time not the end. Since single molecule transcription experiments in vitro do not show delayed release, the authors might discuss what the delayed release in vivo might mean. Paused polymerase prior to the poly-A site, the need to pass some stage in maturation prior to release, a process that anchors material close to a locus that is absent from an in vitro system, or some other possibility?</i>"

We cannot differentiate between a pause in elongation at the 3\u2019 end and retention of cleaved RNA by tethering to RNAPII or chromatin. By extension, we also cannot determine whether these retained RNAs are poly-adenylated. We have clarified this interpretation by considering every occurrence of the words \u2018co-transcriptional\u2019 and \u2018post-transcriptional\u2019 throughout the manuscript and either replacing the terms with \u2018pre-release\u2019 and \u2018post-release\u2019 or reformulating the description all together.

As now explained, we do think our data shows that splicing is faster post-release than at the site of transcription. If the splicing kinetics were unaffected by the departure of the RNA from the transcription site, one would expect a post-release splicing time of 137 s on average. (This time corresponds to the 267 s for the total splicing time, minus the elongation and release times, calculated only for the transcripts that are released unspliced). The fact that we see a much shorter time (13 s) indicates that the pre-release splicing rate cannot be the same as the post-release splicing rate. In fact, the post-release kinetics are unexpectedly fast. The argument that a transcript is probably highly committed before release, with most of the spliceosome assembled, is a persuasive one with which we find ourselves in agreement, but this statement is not the same as a checkpoint requirement. Our splicing inhibition experiment would appear to be clear-cut in this case: treatment with spliceostatin A, which inhibits U2 snRNP assembly, has no measurable effect on the release time. So if there is a checkpoint, it is before U2 recruitment."
