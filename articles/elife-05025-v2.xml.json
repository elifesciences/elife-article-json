                    "text": "The medial temporal lobes play an important role in episodic memory, but over time, hippocampal contributions to retrieval may be diminished. However, it is unclear whether such changes are related to the ability to retrieve contextual information, and whether they are common across all medial temporal regions. Here, we used functional neuroimaging to compare neural responses during immediate and delayed recognition. Results showed that recollection-related activity in the posterior hippocampus declined after a 1-day delay. In contrast, activity was relatively stable in the anterior hippocampus and in neocortical areas. Multi-voxel pattern similarity analyses also revealed that anterior hippocampal patterns contained information about context during item recognition, and after a delay, context coding in this region was related to successful retention of context information. Together, these findings suggest that the anterior and posterior hippocampus have different contributions to memory over time and that neurobiological models of memory must account for these differences."

However, it is unclear whether such changes are related to the ability to retrieve contextual information, and whether they are common across all medial temporal regions. Here, we used functional neuroimaging to compare neural responses during immediate and delayed recognition. Results showed that recollection-related activity in the posterior hippocampus declined after a 1-day delay. In contrast, activity was relatively stable in the anterior hippocampus and in neocortical areas. Multi-voxel pattern similarity analyses also revealed that anterior hippocampal patterns contained information about context during item recognition, and after a delay, context coding in this region was related to successful retention of context information. Together, these findings suggest that the anterior and posterior hippocampus have different contributions to memory over time and that neurobiological models of memory must account for these differences."

Immediately after the second session, the volunteers were asked to complete memory tests while lying in the brain scanner.

Moreover, for the \u2018recall\u2019 responses\u2014in which the volunteers could still retrieve contextual information\u2014the activity of the hippocampus depended on the age of the memories. The anterior (front) part of the hippocampus was active when subjects recalled either new memories or memories from 24 hr previously, whereas the posterior (rear) hippocampus was active only during the recall of new memories. In addition, patterns of activity observed in the anterior hippocampus could be used to determine which room was previously associated with the object. This suggests that contextual information is retained in the anterior hippocampus, but lost from the posterior hippocampus over time."

Some models have suggested that the hippocampal formation (HF) is critical for supporting new memories, but that, over time, memories can be supported by neocortical areas alone. In one account, the shift from hippocampal to cortical representation reflects a transfer of the memory trace through a time-dependent process known as systems consolidation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Squire, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarez and Squire, 1994</a>). This type of transfer is thought to preserve the quality and contents of the memory, although older memories may generally be weaker. Other accounts, however, have argued that changes in hippocampal vs cortical involvement are accompanied by the transformation of episodic memories, which require the HF, into semantic memories, which lack episodic context information and can be supported by cortex alone (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Winocur et al., 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "Changes in the neural bases of memory have typically been described as unfolding over very long timescales, but some studies have documented changes even across relatively short delays. For instance, some functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that, when both encoding and retrieval are controlled in the laboratory, retrieval-related activity in the HF declines from immediate to delayed test with even a 1-day delay (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bosshardt et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Takashima et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2009</a>; but see <a href=\"#bib69\">Stark and Squire, 2000</a>). These findings are echoed by work demonstrating that a night of sleep, or even a brief nap, can alter the neural bases of memory (<a href=\"#bib73\">Takashima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gais et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sterpenich et al., 2007</a>) and have long-term consequences for memory (<a href=\"#bib18\">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</a>). Although these findings are often interpreted as reflecting the early stages of memory systems consolidation, it has remained a challenge to separate changes in neural representation from concomitant changes in episodic quality or content. For instance, one study found that differences in HF activity for recent vs remote autobiographical retrieval could be explained by differences in memory vividness (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gilboa et al., 2004</a>). One way to control for these differences is to limit analysis to memories endorsed with high confidence or recollection (<a href=\"#bib73\">Takashima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sterpenich et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Takashima et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Milton et al., 2011</a>). However, even this approach could be insensitive to differences in the kinds of details that accompany recollection, such as information related to episodic context. The HF is especially involved in tasks that require retrieval of contextual details (<a href=\"#bib15\">Davachi, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Montaldi and Mayes, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Ranganath, 2010</a>), so differences between HF and cortical contributions to memory over time could be due to changes in contextual retrieval."

                        "text": "Another challenge to understanding changes in the neural bases of memory is that current models have not accounted for heterogeneity of function within the MTL. In particular, the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) are critically involved in episodic memory, yet they affiliate with different large-scale cortical networks (<a href=\"#bib40\">Libby et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ritchey et al., 2014</a>) and are widely believed to be functionally distinct from each other and from the HF (<a href=\"#bib15\">Davachi, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Montaldi and Mayes, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Norman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Ranganath, 2010</a>). Nonetheless, current models have been vague with respect to their predictions for the PRC and PHC, either grouping them alongside the HF (<a href=\"#bib67\">Squire, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">McClelland et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997</a>) or ignoring them altogether (<a href=\"#bib80\">Winocur et al., 2010</a>). The PRC and PHC also functionally interact with different pathways along the longitudinal axis of the HF (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kahn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Poppenk and Moscovitch, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Libby et al., 2012</a>), suggesting additional heterogeneity within the HF. For instance, the anterior and posterior HF are thought to play different roles in memory for spatial context (<a href=\"#bib46\">Moser and Moser, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Poppenk et al., 2013</a>), with coarse context coding in the anterior HF and specific place coding in the posterior HF (<a href=\"#bib56\">Poppenk et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Evensmoen et al., 2014</a>). Because memories can lose contextual specificity over time (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wiltgen and Silva, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Winocur et al., 2007</a>), differences in the scale of context processing in the MTL might be associated with differences in MTL contributions to memory over time. Despite this heterogeneity, prior imaging studies have not systematically investigated time-dependent differences in recruitment of the anterior and posterior HF, PRC, and PHC during retrieval. Thus, an important next step is to clarify the roles of the anterior and posterior HF and parahippocampal areas in supporting memory over time."

Across 2 days, participants encoded sentences, each of which described an association between an item and a room in a house, such that each item was associated with one of eight contexts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Immediately after the second encoding session, participants were scanned while completing an item recognition test. To evaluate responses related to item recollection and context memory, we first compared the overall magnitude of recollection-related activity for each delay, which allowed us to determine whether changes in MTL involvement are observed even when controlling for subjective recollection. Next, we leveraged a novel multi-voxel pattern similarity analysis approach (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kriegeskorte, 2008</a>) that measured the sensitivity of voxel patterns in MTL subregions to information about shared study context (c.f., [<a href=\"#bib29\">Hannula et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hsieh et al., 2014</a>]), thereby providing an objective measure of context reactivation. This analysis allowed us to determine whether a region's continued involvement in recollection is related to its representation of context information in memory. Moreover, we used a region-of-interest (ROI) approach to separately examine the properties of the anterior and posterior HF, PRC, and PHC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), thus shedding new light on the regional specificity of memory changes within the MTL."

To test whether recollection-related activity in this network was modulated by delay, we conducted ROI analyses for the retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate, precuneus, angular gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex. In the left hemisphere, all of these regions showed a main effect of memory, all <i>F</i>s &gt; 9.5, <i>p</i>s &lt; 0.007, with no significant interactions with delay, <i>F</i>s &lt; 2.21, <i>p</i>s &gt; 0.15 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In the right hemisphere, recollection-related activity in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate declined across the delay (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, recollection effects in these regions were weaker in general, consistent with previous findings that cortical activity associated with recollection of verbal materials tends to be strongest in the left hemisphere (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yonelinas et al., 2005</a>). Exploratory whole-brain, voxel-wise comparisons revealed that both immediate and delayed recollection were associated with activity in the recollection network (corrected p &lt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), with no significant delay-dependent differences in recollection-related activity (corrected p &lt; 0.05). To better define where recollection-related activity was insensitive to delay, we identified regions that were conjointly involved in immediate and delayed recollection (corrected joint p &lt; 0.05) while excluding voxels showing even small delay differences (liberally defined at p &lt; 0.05 uncorrected). All neocortical regions within the recollection network contained clusters that survived this approach (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results suggest that, for the most part, recollection-related responses in the neocortical recollection network were maintained across the delay."

As depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, multi-voxel patterns within each ROI were estimated for every recollection trial, and pairs of trials were compared by calculating the similarity between their associated voxel patterns. Similarity values were then summarized according to whether the items had shared context information during encoding (same room from the same study list: for example, \u2018the apple is in the <i>bedroom</i>\u2019 and \u2018the pencil is in the <i>bedroom</i>\u2019) or had not shared information (different rooms from the same study list: for example, \u2018the apple is in the <i>bedroom</i>\u2019 and \u2018the chair is in the <i>kitchen</i>\u2019). Because there was no context information present during the item recognition phase, any pattern similarity differences between these pair types must be ascribed to the reactivation of context information from memory. Thus, context similarity was defined as the difference in pattern similarity between same-room and different-room pairs, evaluated separately for each ROI. Note that because the locations were typical rooms in a house, this form of context retrieval may reflect a mixture of both spatial and semantic context information (i.e., remembering the general location or semantic features of the room associated with the item)."

In the left anterior HF, pattern similarity was significantly greater among same-room pairs than different-room pairs, <i>t</i>(18) = 2.34, p = 0.015 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), and a similar trend was observed in the left PRC, <i>t</i>(18) = 1.73, p = 0.051.

Context similarity effects were also absent from cortical regions outside of the MTL, either immediately or after a delay, <i>t</i>s &lt; 1.8, <i>p</i>s &gt; 0.05, suggesting that these effects were selective to the left anterior MTL. The MTL findings were verified with a randomization test showing that pattern similarity for same-room pairs exceeded what would be expected by chance if context information were randomly assigned (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Additionally, when the same analysis was run with familiarity trials instead of recollection trials, no differences were observed between same and different context trial pairs, <i>t</i>s &lt; 1, <i>p</i>s &gt; 0.2 (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

The left PRC showed a significant main effect of context similarity across both delays, <i>F</i>(1, 18) = 5.78, p = 0.027, and context similarity did not interact with delay, <i>F</i>(1, 18) = 0.54, p = 0.47. In fact, the PRC showed a marginal context similarity effect for the delayed list as well, <i>t</i>(18) = 1.54, p = 0.07, suggesting that the sensitivity of this region to context information was stable over time. The anterior HF, on the other hand, showed neither a significant main effect, <i>F</i>(1, 18) = 2.99, p = 0.10, nor interaction, <i>F</i>(1, 18) = 1.13, p = 0.30. The absence of a clear main effect or interaction may be due, in part, to substantial variability in context similarity effects during delayed recollection. One possibility is that this variability is related to individual differences in retention of context information in memory. To test this hypothesis, we correlated individual subjects' context similarity estimates (i.e., the voxel pattern differences between same- and different-context trial pairs) with their performance on the subsequent associative recognition test, based on the idea that the associative recognition test relied on the same kind of room information measured by the pattern similarity analysis. Indeed, participants who performed best on the associative recognition test also showed the largest context similarity effect in the left anterior HF during delayed recollection, <i>r</i> = 0.53, <i>t</i>(16) = 2.53, p = 0.022 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This relationship was significant even after controlling for individual differences in the number of recollection trials, <i>t</i>(15) = 2.81, p = 0.013. For the PRC, the correlation was in the same direction but not significant, <i>r</i> = 0.25, <i>t</i>(16) = 1.02, p = 0.32. Finally, there was no significant relationship between anterior HF context similarity and associative recognition for the immediate list, <i>r</i> = \u22120.17, <i>t</i>(16) = 0.71, p = 0.49; however, there was little variability in the similarity estimates for these trials. These findings provide strong evidence that, after a delay, the context similarity analysis was picking up on meaningful associative information during the item recollection period. Moreover, they are consistent with the memory transformation account, in that anterior HF involvement in context coding over time was contingent on the retention of context information in memory."

During item recollection, the involvement of cortical MTL areas was stable over time. Within the HF, however, there were different effects for anterior and posterior regions. Whereas posterior HF showed reduced recollection-related activity after a 1-day delay, recollection-related activity in anterior HF remained relatively stable. Furthermore, anterior HF activity patterns carried information about contexts associated with the items at study, and this pattern information was maintained over time in participants who successfully retained context associations. Below, we relate these findings to extant neurobiological models of memory and discuss the specific contributions of individual MTL regions. We conclude that models of memory must account for variability among MTL subregions with respect to their involvement in memory retrieval over time."

To our knowledge, neither account makes explicit predictions about variability along the longitudinal axis of the HF. In the present study, the anterior and posterior HF had dissociable responses during immediate and delayed retrieval. Whereas recollection-related activity in the posterior HF decreased over time, activity in the anterior HF was relatively stable across the 1-day delay. In previous fMRI studies that used paradigms comparable to the one used here, HF results have been somewhat mixed: some studies have shown that HF activity was greater for early than delayed retrieval (<a href=\"#bib73\">Takashima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sterpenich et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Takashima et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yamashita et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Milton et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Watanabe et al., 2012</a>), but others have reported no change (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stark and Squire, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Janzen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Suchan et al., 2008</a>) or even the opposite effect (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bosshardt et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gais et al., 2007</a>). Some of these differences may be related to the sensitivity of the fMRI analysis to specific memory processes: some studies reporting no change used simple comparisons of targets and foils (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stark and Squire, 2000</a>) or recognized and forgotten trials (<a href=\"#bib32\">Janzen et al., 2008</a>), whereas studies that isolated activity for high-confidence, recollection-based or associative hits have often reported delay-dependence (<a href=\"#bib73\">Takashima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sterpenich et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Takashima et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yamashita et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Milton et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Watanabe et al., 2012</a>; but see <a href=\"#bib72\">Suchan et al., 2008</a>). Although some delay effects have been localized to the anterior HF (<a href=\"#bib73\">Takashima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Milton et al., 2011</a>), differences in the posterior HF have been commonly observed for studies using associative memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib74\">Takashima et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yamashita et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Watanabe et al., 2012</a>). By investigating delay effects within anatomically restricted regions, the current approach might have improved our ability to detect differences in localization that might not have been readily apparent in a group analysis applying voxel-wise thresholds. Thus, the finding that changes in recollection-related activity were circumscribed to the posterior HF is consistent with the available literature, but would not have been predicted by extant models."

For example, one study reported that the anterior HF showed a larger delay-dependent difference than the posterior HF during autobiographical memory retrieval (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gilboa et al., 2004</a>). Another study used multi-voxel pattern analysis to decode information about autobiographical events. This study reported that patterns in the posterior HF could be used to decode remote but not recent autobiographical memories during repeated retrieval events, whereas patterns in the anterior HF could be used to decode both recent and remote memories (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonnici et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2013</a>). At face value, these findings might seem to contradict the present results, but there are numerous differences between autobiographical memory tasks and paradigms that focus on laboratory-controlled events. In particular, the use of repeated retrieval events and long retention delays could complicate the interpretation of fMRI studies of autobiographical memory retrieval. During remote autobiographical retrieval, hippocampal activity could be related to the construction of a new memory for an old event, or to the retrieval of the original memory or its more recent reconstructions. Another issue is that differences between recent and remote autobiographical memories can be confounded by differences in vividness and context specificity. Indeed, in the study by <a href=\"#bib26\">Gilboa et al. (2004)</a>, there were no significant delay-dependent differences in the HF after controlling for vividness. Although laboratory-controlled studies are not immune to this possible confound, the issue was mitigated in the present study by limiting analyses to memory retrieval accompanied by recollection and by identifying neural patterns associated with studied context information."

Because recollection can be triggered by different kinds of associative details, including information about encoding context, we separately examined the sensitivity of the multi-voxel patterns to context information learned during encoding. Multi-voxel patterns in the left anterior HF were sensitive to context similarity during immediate recollection, and after a delay this effect was strongest for participants who could accurately retrieve context associations. According to one view of HF function, the anterior HF may be especially involved in representing episodic context at a global level (<a href=\"#bib56\">Poppenk et al., 2013</a>). In support of this view, the anterior HF contains cells with larger place fields than the posterior HF (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kjelstrup et al., 2008</a>), and it is involved in coding information about the coarse location of objects (<a href=\"#bib22\">Evensmoen et al., 2014</a>), the global position of landmarks (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ekstrom et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Morgan et al., 2011</a>), and the gist of memories (<a href=\"#bib55\">Poppenk et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gutchess and Schacter, 2012</a>). Taking this view into consideration, it may be that pattern similarity effects in the anterior HF reflect the activation of generalized context information (e.g., general features of the room associated with the item at study) that was shared across many encoding events. As discussed below, the posterior HF might support more specific representations of context (e.g., remembering the exact location in which a specific item was imagined in the bedroom) in a more time-limited way. Regardless of the scale of anterior HF representations, it is noteworthy that recollection-related activity in the anterior HF was relatively stable over the delay, and that the anterior HF continued to show evidence for context coding in participants who retained context information in memory, suggesting that the type of information carried by the anterior HF can be long lasting. These findings are compatible with the memory transformation account, which models posit that the HF should be involved in retrieval so long as its preferred form of mnemonic information is maintained."

A few previous studies have shown that neural patterns present during encoding are reactivated during item recognition (<a href=\"#bib34\">Johnson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ritchey et al., 2013</a>) and cued recall (<a href=\"#bib68\">Staresina et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</a>), and that patterns within the MTL carry information related to study context (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hannula et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hsieh et al., 2014</a>). For instance, during cued recall, patterns in the anterior HF, PRC, and PHC were shown to carry information about the study context (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hannula et al., 2013</a>). However, there has been little evidence that item recollection involves the spontaneous reactivation of context-related patterns even without an overt source decision, despite the assumption that recollection typically involves contextual retrieval. In one study, <a href=\"#bib34\">Johnson et al. (2009)</a> showed that a classifier trained to discriminate among study contexts was sensitive to context information that was incidentally reactivated during recognition, and that for the posterior cingulate, context reactivation was especially apparent for items accompanied by recollection. However, this study did not report context reactivation effects within the HF. The present work expands on these findings to demonstrate that, during recollection, left anterior HF patterns carried information about the context associated with an item during encoding, even when context was not explicitly cued or re-presented. The context similarity effect in the HF was relatively small, perhaps because HF patterns are more sensitive to similarities in object\u2013context associations than to context alone (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hsieh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Libby et al., 2014</a>). The finding that context-related pattern similarity was predictive of associative recognition performance, however, provides converging evidence that hippocampal voxel patterns carry behaviorally relevant context information. Nevertheless, future work will be necessary to determine the sensitivity of hippocampal voxel pattern information to other kinds of context manipulations."

It also tended to show context similarity effects that persisted across the delay. The anterior HF is strongly connected with the PRC, which is part of an anterior temporal system thought to be important for processing, remembering, and assigning value to items (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</a>). These two regions may work together to support memory for item or item\u2013context associations, and context similarity effects in the anterior HF may reflect the retrieval of contextual information in response to an item cue. The PRC, on the other hand, has been linked to item recognition (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib14\">Davachi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ranganath et al., 2003</a>]), recollection of item associations (<a href=\"#bib17\">Diana et al., 2010</a>), and semantic processing (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib75\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Clarke and Tyler, 2014</a>]). Thus, the prior literature is most consistent with a role for the PRC in item processing, and the finding of a context similarity effect in the PRC was unexpected. However, there is some evidence that the PRC may additionally carry some information about context, such as the locations of items in space (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burke and Barnes, 2014</a>). PRC lesions have been shown to disrupt some forms of context memory, including object\u2013context associations (<a href=\"#bib51\">Norman and Eacott, 2005</a>), positional changes in object arrays (<a href=\"#bib50\">Norman and Eacott, 2005</a>), and contextual fear (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bucci et al., 2002</a>)\u2014although these impairments have typically been more circumscribed than those observed following PHC damage (<a href=\"#bib51\">Norman and Eacott, 2005</a>). Based on this literature and the present data, we cannot rule out the possibility that like the anterior HF, the PRC is involved in the long-term storage of the association between an object and the general context in which it was encountered. Alternatively, it could be that the anterior HF and PRC are both sensitive to shared context information, but for different reasons: whereas the anterior HF might carry general representations of context, pattern similarity effects in the PRC might reflect the recollection of items associated with each room, through episodic associations learned during encoding or through existing semantic associations."

As noted above, it is possible that the posterior HF encodes highly specific contextual details (<a href=\"#bib56\">Poppenk et al., 2013</a>), such as precise locations within a spatial context (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kjelstrup et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Evensmoen et al., 2014</a>) or positions within a sequence (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hsieh et al., 2014</a>), which might be useful for disambiguating among related contexts. For instance, in one study, hemodynamic responses in the posterior HF were greater during the retrieval of precise rather than coarse location information associated with an object (<a href=\"#bib22\">Evensmoen et al., 2014</a>). It is possible that, here, the reduction in posterior HF activity across the delay reflects the forgetting of trial-specific context information. Prior work in rodents has shown that memories may lose their contextual specificity over time (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wiltgen and Silva, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Winocur et al., 2007</a>), and that the loss of specificity is associated with diminished dependence on the dorsal HF (which may be homologous to the posterior HF in humans) during retrieval (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wiltgen et al., 2010</a>). In addition, if the posterior HF codes only specific context information, this could explain the absence of a context similarity effect in this region. By definition, the multi-voxel pattern similarity analysis used here depended on similarities among trials that had been associated with the same \u2018room\u2019, and was therefore insensitive to trial-specific information. Some previous studies have used approaches that have enabled them to identify event- or scene-specific patterns, and these studies have shown that this kind of specific information can be decoded from multi-voxel patterns in the HF (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chadwick et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bonnici et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hsieh et al., 2014</a>), and that the specificity of HF patterns is positively related to memory performance (<a href=\"#bib39\">LaRocque et al., 2013</a>). In this study, we were unable to directly measure trial-specific information in the posterior HF, but future studies could incorporate graded levels of context specificity in order to test its relation to response changes over time."

One interesting point of divergence is between the posterior HF and PHC, which are strongly interconnected (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</a>).

Here, patterns in both regions were insensitive to shared context information, yet the PHC was involved in memory recollection after a 1-day delay, whereas the posterior HF was not.

Future work should address whether the PRC and PHC are similarly involved in memory tested after longer intervals and with measures that are more sensitive to the specificity of information retained in memory. Additionally, because memory was tested after a 1-day delay, we cannot disentangle changes attributable to active sleep-dependent processes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ellenbogen et al., 2006</a>) from more passive time-dependent changes. Finally, an important next step would be to compare the item\u2013location associations used here with associations that may be less dependent on HF function, such as unitized associations (<a href=\"#bib27\">Giovanello et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Quamme et al., 2007</a>) or emotional associations.

Recollection was defined as (R<sub>old</sub> \u2212 R<sub>new</sub>)/(1 \u2212 R<sub>new</sub>), where R<sub>old</sub> is the rate of \u2018R\u2019 responses to old items, and R<sub>new</sub> is the rate of \u2018R\u2019 responses to new items.

Associative recognition performance was measured as the discriminability (d\u2032) between intact and recombined sentences, separately for the immediate or delayed encoding list. To determine the relation between item recognition and associative recognition, the proportion of correct associative recognition responses was calculated for items previously marked as recollected, familiar, or forgotten.

Pattern similarity values were aggregated according to whether or not the items had shared context information during encoding, that is, same-room vs different-room similarity. For instance, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, the item pair \u2018apple\u2019 and \u2018pencil\u2019 share information because they were encoded in sentences pairing them with the same room (\u2018bedroom\u2019), whereas the item pair \u2018apple\u2019 and \u2018chair\u2019 do not share information because they had been paired with different rooms. Different-room pairs excluded pairs of rooms that had been experimentally grouped after encoding (see \u2018Experimental design\u2019). Thus, for any given item, its same-room pairs included all other items encoded with the same room, and its different-room pairs included items encoded with one of two other rooms on the same day. To control for differences in pattern similarity between runs, same-room and different-room similarity were first averaged within each run, and then similarity values from the three runs were averaged together. To control for similarities among adjacent trials, only pairs at least two trials apart were included in the analysis; however, because trial sequences were randomly determined for each participant, temporal autocorrelation was unlikely to produce spurious pattern similarity effects at the group level (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mumford et al., 2014</a>).

This difference was tested with one-sample <i>t</i>-tests based on our directional hypothesis that same-room similarity should be greater than different-room similarity. For regions showing evidence for context similarity in the immediate condition, when context memory was strongest, we additionally tested the influence of delay on context similarity was tested with repeated-measures ANOVAs with factors for pair type (same-room, different-room) and delay (immediate, delayed). Finally, Pearson's correlation was used to test the relationship between context similarity and subsequent associative recognition performance for the delayed list, and multiple linear regression was used to verify that the observed relationship was not explained by differences in the number of item recollection trials. One participant was excluded from the regression analyses due to below-chance associative recognition performance."

Therefore, the current experiment may be tapping into delay-related changes in recollection but it is not clear if they are related to consolidation. For instance, the authors note that Post HF may code for item-specific context (not measurable here). Post HF may no longer show recollection effects after a delay because this specific context was forgotten over the delay. All what is left may be more general context (such as the associated room) represented in Ant HIP, observable at least in the subjects who remembered the associated room."

It is one thing to note that the similarity effects are not present or stable, but the baseline level of similarity in PHC and post HF may be higher than in other regions, which may affect the conclusions regarding function. The conclusion that similarity in Ant HF is maintained over a delay does not receive strong support in the data considering that there is no difference between same, and different, room similarity in delayed recognition. This would then have consequences for the interpretation. The basis for this conclusion of stability rests on the correlation between similarity and recognition performance, but while this addresses the contributors to performance, it does not address stability per se. It would also be helpful to see whether the correlation between immediate similarity and recognition is also significant."

To be clear, our primary activation analysis did not compare immediate and delayed \u201cRemember\u201d trials. Instead, we tested for a delay-dependent difference between \u201cRemember\u201d and \u201cFamiliar\u201d trials. Specifically, in the posterior hippocampus, there was an interaction between delay and response type, such that activity was greater for Remember than for Familiar trials for the immediate but not the delayed list. If RT confounds were responsible for the delay-dependent activation difference, then we would expect that RTs would also show an interaction between delay and memory response. We did not observe this interaction, F(1,26)=.06, p=.80. There was a main effect of delay, such that RTs were faster for all immediate items than for all delayed items, F(1,26)=13.87, p=.001, but this held true regardless of whether the item was recognized on the basis of recollection or familiarity. Note that this pattern also holds when considering only the participants included in the fMRI analyses (interaction: F(1,18)=.05, p=.83; main effect: F(1,18)=5.87, p=.026). Thus, response times are unlikely to account for why posterior hippocampal activation differences between Remember and Familiar trials were larger for immediate than delayed trials.

In my view, the lack of subregional specificity in those models does not necessarily mean a challenge to them. Furthermore, most consolidation literature concerns longer delays than just one day (sometimes years). Therefore, the current experiment may be tapping into delay-related changes in recollection but it is not clear if they are related to consolidation. For instance, the authors note that Post HF may code for item-specific context (not measurable here). Post HF may no longer show recollection effects after a delay because this specific context was forgotten over the delay. All what is left may be more general context (such as the associated room) represented in Ant HIP, observable at least in the subjects who remembered the associated room</i>."

There is considerable evidence suggesting that early stages of systems consolidation can be initiated during the first night of sleep after learning (Born and Wilhelm, 2012), but little is known about how initial changes in hippocampal representation are related to longer-lasting changes. It is possible that the changes in activation magnitude and pattern similarity observed here reflect forgetting of certain aspects of context information, and that qualitatively different kinds of changes\u2014particularly in cortical representation\u2014might be apparent over a longer interval.\u201d"
