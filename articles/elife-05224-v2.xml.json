Using shotgun metagenomic data from wild baboons, we found that social group membership and social network relationships predicted both the taxonomic structure of the gut microbiome and the structure of genes encoded by gut microbial species. Rates of interaction directly explained variation in the gut microbiome, even after controlling for diet, kinship, and shared environments. They therefore strongly implicate direct physical contact among social partners in the transmission of gut microbial species. We identified 51 socially structured taxa, which were significantly enriched for anaerobic and non-spore-forming lifestyles. Our results argue that social interactions are an important determinant of gut microbiome composition in natural animal populations\u2014a relationship with important ramifications for understanding how social relationships influence health, as well as the evolution of group living."

Using shotgun metagenomic data from wild baboons, we found that social group membership and social network relationships predicted both the taxonomic structure of the gut microbiome and the structure of genes encoded by gut microbial species. Rates of interaction directly explained variation in the gut microbiome, even after controlling for diet, kinship, and shared environments. They therefore strongly implicate direct physical contact among social partners in the transmission of gut microbial species. We identified 51 socially structured taxa, which were significantly enriched for anaerobic and non-spore-forming lifestyles. Our results argue that social interactions are an important determinant of gut microbiome composition in natural animal populations\u2014a relationship with important ramifications for understanding how social relationships influence health, as well as the evolution of group living."

Among the least understood but potentially most significant such forces are the effects of host social interactions. From an evolutionary perspective, social effects on the gut microbiome may be an underappreciated consequence of group living, associated with both fitness costs and benefits (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lombardo, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Archie and Theis, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ezenwa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Montiel-Castro et al., 2013</a>). For example, co-housing in lab mice promotes the transmission of bacterial communities that contribute to inflammatory bowel disease, implicating social relationships in microbiome-associated disease risk (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garrett et al., 2010</a>). In bumblebees, socially transmitted gut bacteria protect against a widespread and virulent gut parasite, suggesting that socially mediated microbial transmission can also confer powerful benefits (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koch and Schmid-Hempel, 2011</a>). If social interactions predict gut microbiome composition in free-living vertebrates as well, this link could help explain the strong association between social interactions and health in highly social species (e.g., <a href=\"#bib10\">Berkman and Syme, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">House et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sapolsky, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010</a>)."

For instance, in wild chimpanzees, social group membership predicts the identity and abundance of gut microbes, while kinship, age, and sex do not (<a href=\"#bib17\">Degnan et al., 2012</a>). In humans, shared residence predicts gut microbiome similarity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kinross and Nicholson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Song et al., 2013</a>). To date, these effects have largely been attributed to shared diets, as members of the same household or social group tend to consume similar foods in similar proportions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Claesson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kinross and Nicholson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</a>).

Such complementary data sets are rare, but are frequently collected in long-term primate field studies. Here, we leveraged one such study, on the intensively studied Amboseli baboons of Kenya (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alberts and Altmann, 2012</a>), to test whether social group structure and social interactions within groups predict either the taxonomic or the functional composition of the gut microbiome. Like humans, baboons are highly social, group-living primates. Members of the same social group travel together, consume similar foods, and drink from the same water sources. Within social groups, individuals selectively engage in frequent affiliative grooming interactions, which solidify social bonds and have the potential to mediate bacterial transmission. Within this context, we addressed three central questions. We first asked (i) does social group membership predict gut microbiome composition, as shown for humans and chimpanzees (<a href=\"#bib17\">Degnan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kinross and Nicholson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Song et al., 2013</a>)? We then asked two novel questions that have not been addressed in prior studies: (ii) within social groups, do rates of social interactions (captured here by grooming-based social networks) predict gut microbiome similarity after accounting for dietary patterns, shared environments, and kinship? And (iii) which bacterial species, with what lifestyle traits, are most likely to be socially transmitted, both between and within social groups?"

Grooming network proximity also predicted microbiota composition in this restricted data set (Mantel tests: Mica's group: <i>r</i> = \u22120.328, p = 9.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>; Viola's group: <i>r</i> = \u22120.228, p = 2.6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>), and remained a significant predictor of microbiota composition after accounting for dietary similarity (partial Mantel test controlling for dietary similarity: Mica's group p = 0.020; Viola's group: p = 0.005) and spatial proximity (partial Mantel test controlling for spatial proximity for Mica's group p = 0.039; Viola's group: p = 0.005). Additionally, we found no evidence that close social partners consumed more similar diets (Mantel tests: Mica's group: Mantel r = \u22120.200, p = 0.080; Viola's group: Mantel r = 0.0942, p = 0.876)."

We reasoned that, if socially structured species depend on direct transmission between baboons, as our data suggest, they should be less likely than other species to persist outside of a host. Thus, we predicted that socially structured species would tend to be anaerobic and unable to produce spores. To test these predictions, we turned to information about bacterial lifestyles available in the Genomes OnLine Database (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pagani et al., 2012</a>), using both species-level (n = 138) and genus-level (n = 299) traits (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for trait assignment criteria).

For instance, 17% of the species in this analysis differed significantly in abundance between social groups; however 32% of anaerobic and non-spore forming species were significantly socially structured.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to test whether rates of interaction within cohabiting groups, as opposed to between groups or households, explain variation in the gut microbiome. Specifically, we found that an individual's contacts in a grooming-based social network, as well as its membership in a given social group, were highly predictive of its gut microbiome composition at both the species and genic levels. Unlike prior studies, we were able to exclude kinship, shared diet, and shared environment as the basis for our observations. Our results are thus unique among studies to date in the degree to which they implicate direct, affiliative physical contact as a determinant of gut microbiome composition in natural populations. Our data also provide the first evidence in vertebrates that social effects on the microbiome extend to its functional composition. These findings lend important support to the hypothesis that social interactions play a role in the health-related consequences of variation in gut microbiome composition (e.g., <a href=\"#bib54\">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hooper et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bengmark, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Iida et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Koeth et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Viaud et al., 2013</a>), with potentially important consequences for the evolution of sociality (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lombardo, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Archie and Theis, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ezenwa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Montiel-Castro et al., 2013</a>)."

However, unlike some prior studies in mice and bumblebees (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garrett et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Koch and Schmid-Hempel, 2011</a>), baboons are not coprophagic, raising a question about the mechanisms that facilitate gut microbial transfer between social partners. One possibility is that the duration and intimacy of grooming bouts, which include frequent hand-to-mouth contact, may be important in exposing baboons to the gut bacteria of their grooming partners. Furthermore, some grooming bouts, especially those directed from adult males to estrous females, concentrate heavily on the ano-genital region, increasing the probability of fecal-oral transfer. Such close contact may be especially important in the transmission of anaerobic, non-spore-forming species, as these bacteria are not thought to persist for long periods of time outside of a host (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wilson, 2008</a>). However, some relatively hardy bacterial species may also be transmitted via social contact (<a href=\"#bib57\">VanderWaal et al., 2013</a>), and recent modeling efforts suggest that fecal-oral transmission can be highly efficient in socially structured host populations, even when transmission is indirectly mediated through the soil (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nunn et al., 2011</a>)."

One explanation for this pattern is that when bacteria from a host colonize a social partner, they arrive pre-adapted to occupy the available gut microbial niches in their new host (<a href=\"#bib59\">Walter and Ley, 2011</a>). Specifically, because members of a single bacterial species can have markedly different gene contents, a given member of a gut microbial species may perform different functions in different hosts (<a href=\"#bib59\">Walter and Ley, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Costello et al., 2012</a>). However, if social partners transmit bacteria with similar capabilities to each other, these bacteria may serve similar functions in both hosts and thus be found in similar abundances. This hypothesis could be further tested by assessing if bacterial species isolated from social partners tend to represent shared strains that perform similar biological functions."

In addition, surfaces in human homes may act as reservoirs for household-specific bacterial communities (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lax et al., 2014</a>), possibly facilitating social transmission through intermediate surfaces. Future work, in both humans and animals, will be important to establishing the relative importance and generality of socially mediated transmission. In particular, population genetic studies have the potential to directly map the genetic structure of microbiome-associated species onto the social structure of host populations to test whether close social partners tend to share genetically more similar bacterial populations than non-partners (e.g., <a href=\"#bib57\">VanderWaal et al., 2013</a>). Fine-grained studies of how gut microbial communities change in social species, before and after perturbations to their social networks, will also be important for understanding the time scales on which social transmission of microbes act. Such efforts would also contribute an important longitudinal perspective. Our power to identify associations between social relationships and microbiome composition in this study was probably facilitated by our sampling scheme, which eliminated the contribution of temporal or seasonal effects. More comprehensive long-term studies will be valuable for placing these effects in context, alongside concomitant changes in season, diet, and resource use."

Health and survival in social species (including humans and baboons) are also strongly associated with social relationships (<a href=\"#bib10\">Berkman and Syme, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">House et al., 1988</a>; e.g., <a href=\"#bib44\">Sapolsky, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Silk et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Silk et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Archie et al., 2014</a>). However, few studies have connected these two observations. By highlighting the strong relationship between microbiome composition and social networks, our findings indicate the importance of further research in this area. One of the most important unanswered questions is whether social network-mediated microbiome sharing produces net fitness benefits or costs for hosts. Previous research on fecal-oral or social network-mediated transmission has focused almost exclusively on pathogens or parasites. Microbiome studies have the potential to broaden this perspective to include species with beneficial effects. Indeed, while we found several socially structured taxa that have been associated with pathogenic effects (e.g., <i>Fusobacterium</i> spp, <i>Campylobacter ureolyticus</i>), we found several other bacteria thought to be beneficial to hosts. For example, members of the phylum Actinobacteria, especially the genus <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, are commonly thought to have probiotic effects in humans due to their role in complex carbohydrate digestion, pathogen inhibition, and vitamin production (<a href=\"#bib47\">Servin, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gronlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Turroni et al., 2008</a>). Understanding the balance between social transmission of pathogenic vs commensal or beneficial bacteria thus promises to provide valuable new insight into the link between disease risk and the evolution of sociality."

MetaPhlAn 2.0 estimates the relative abundance of bacterial species by mapping reads against a set of clade-specific marker sequences, which unequivocally identify microbial clades at the species level or higher taxonomic levels. Based on 12,926 complete bacterial genomes, MetaPhlAn 2.0 is able to provide clade-specific markers for a total of 3848 bacterial species, 925 of which were detected in our data set (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary files 2, 3</a>). Specifically, we mapped our sequence reads against the clade-specific markers using the \u2018very-sensitive-local\u2019 alignment mode implemented in Bowtie 2 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Langmead et al., 2009</a>). This mode produces alignments that can be trimmed at one or both extremes in order to optimize the alignment score. Because spurious or poor-quality reads are unlikely to match any of the pre-defined marker sequences, no preprocessing of the metagenomic DNA sequences was performed, as recommended by the authors. However, we tested the robustness of these estimates by re-running MetaPhlAn 2.0 on a subset of our data after trimming the reads to eliminate adapter sequences and bases with a quality score &lt;20. Correlations between the bacterial abundance estimates obtained using unprocessed data and those obtained using the trimmed data were always above 0.97, confirming that MetaPhlAn 2.0 is indeed highly robust to potential sequence artifacts."

This analysis tests whether individuals with closer social bonds (as measured by the pairwise matrix of grooming strengths) tend to have more similar values for taxon abundance than those with weak or absent social bonds. Here, we again investigated the 327 most prevalent species from the MetaPhlAn 2.0 analysis. For this analysis, our power was constrained by the number of individuals in the social group. Thus, while we identified a large number of socially structured species within Viola's group (n = 51 of 327 species tested, at a false discovery rate of 10%), we did not observe strong evidence for socially structured species within Mica's group. Further investigation suggests this result is a consequence of sample size, as subsampling Viola's group (n = 29 individuals) to the size of Mica's group (n = 19 individuals) also resulted in little power to detect socially structured species. More than half of the time (58% of 100 random subsamples), fewer than 5 such cases were detected in Viola's group after subsampling, and more than a third of the time (35%) no cases could be detected with the smaller sample size. Hence, we focused on results from Viola's group. We again used a 10% FDR threshold to identify significant taxa in this analysis, after ensuring that the empirical null distribution was uniform (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The de novo assembly, however, identified a very large contribution of the phylum Spirochaetes in Viola's group (mean = 23.7%), which was primarily driven by the abundance of reads mapping to the bacteria <i>Treponema succinifaciens</i>. Notably, we also identified <i>T. succinifaciens</i> as significantly more abundant in Viola's group members than in Mica's group members using the MetaPhlAn approach (p = 2.46 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221210</sup>).

Kinship did not explain this relationship (partial Mantel test relating group co-residency to taxonomic composition, controlling for pedigree-based kinship: r = 0.434, p &lt; 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>). Additionally, the de novo assembly approach again revealed that, within groups, closer grooming partners harbored more similar gut microbes (Mica's group: Mantel test <i>r</i> = \u22120.197, p = 0.016; Viola's group: <i>r</i> = \u22120.147, p = 1.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>). However, while this relationship survives correcting for kinship in Viola's group (<i>r</i> = \u22120.112, p = 0.017), it is not statistically detectable after controlling for kinship in Mica's group (<i>r</i> = \u22120.091, p = 0.20).

In Mica's group, controlling for proximity produced a consistent trend with our main analyses, but eliminated the strong statistical signal of grooming on microbiome composition (Mica's group p = 0.124). We surmise that patterns of proximity, kinship, and grooming may be too closely correlated in Mica's group to disentangle in the de novo assembly-based data set, which may produce noisier estimates of taxonomic abundance."

The main issue is that the procedure used to transform the data to fit a normal distribution could lead to slight inaccuracies in the p-values calculated by GEMMA. These inaccuracies could be further amplified by use of the FDR. To account for these effects, it was suggested that the procedure be empirically validated by shuffling the social group membership data, and verifying that no significant species are identified. It was also suggested that a similar empirical validation could add support to the within-group social network results. Finally, there were several areas in the text where p-values are given, but it is unclear what test was being run. These should be fully explained."

Specifically, to confirm that our analysis did not bias us towards detecting false positives, we compared the signal in our true data set against an empirically derived null, obtained by permuting group membership across species abundances while keeping the modeling approach, kinship structure, and all other covariates constant. No differentially abundant species were identified in any of 10 permutations at a 10% FDR (the threshold used in our main analyses), and we obtained a uniform distribution of p-values for the empirical null. The difference between the null distribution and the true data set, which is highly enriched for a signature of social group, is shown using both histogram and quantile\u2013quantile plots in the new <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."

As above, we compared the signal in our true data set against an empirically derived null, this time permuting species abundance 10 times across group members while keeping the modeling approach and social network structure constant. No socially structured species (within group) were identified when analyzing permuted data using a 10% FDR, and we obtained a uniform distribution of p-values for the empirical null.
