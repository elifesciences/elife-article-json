In particular, no ion channel has been characterized in melanosomes, organelles that produce and store the major mammalian pigment melanin. Defects in melanosome function cause albinism, characterized by vision and pigmentation deficits, impaired retinal development, and increased susceptibility to skin and eye cancers. The most common form of albinism is caused by mutations in oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2), a melanosome-specific transmembrane protein with unknown function. Here we used direct patch-clamp of skin and eye melanosomes to identify a novel chloride-selective anion conductance mediated by OCA2 and required for melanin production. Expression of OCA2 increases organelle pH, suggesting that the chloride channel might regulate melanin synthesis by modulating melanosome pH. Thus, a melanosomal anion channel that requires OCA2 is essential for skin and eye pigmentation."

In particular, no ion channel has been characterized in melanosomes, organelles that produce and store the major mammalian pigment melanin. Defects in melanosome function cause albinism, characterized by vision and pigmentation deficits, impaired retinal development, and increased susceptibility to skin and eye cancers. The most common form of albinism is caused by mutations in oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2), a melanosome-specific transmembrane protein with unknown function. Here we used direct patch-clamp of skin and eye melanosomes to identify a novel chloride-selective anion conductance mediated by OCA2 and required for melanin production. Expression of OCA2 increases organelle pH, suggesting that the chloride channel might regulate melanin synthesis by modulating melanosome pH. Thus, a melanosomal anion channel that requires OCA2 is essential for skin and eye pigmentation."

To circumvent these difficulties we exploited a dermal melanocyte cell line derived from mice deficient in ocular albinism 1 (<i>Oa1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Palmisano et al., 2008</a>), in which melanosomes are enlarged to up to \u223c1 \u03bcm diameter (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cortese et al., 2005</a>). Recordings from individual melanosomes dissected from <i>Oa1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> melanocytes under the same conditions used for endolysosome patch-clamp experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) revealed a large outwardly rectifying current (I<sub>melano</sub>) with a negative E<sub>rev</sub> that was dependent on luminal Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, similar to currents recorded from OCA2-expressing endolysosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). When currents recorded in the presence of luminal Gluc<sup>\u2212</sup> were subtracted from I<sub>melano</sub> measured in the presence of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, E<sub>rev</sub> was similar to E<sub>Cl</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Heterologous endolysosomal expression of OCA2 contributes to a chloride channel with biophysical properties similar to an endogenous melanosomal OCA2-mediated channel. Importantly, OCA2 activity controls the melanin content of melanosomes, most likely by regulating organellar pH. We propose that OCA2 contributes to a novel melanosome-specific anion current that modulates melanosomal pH for optimal tyrosinase activity required for melanogenesis."

Organelle currents were recorded using borosilicate glass pipettes polished to 7\u20138 M\u03a9 for lysosomes and 9\u201312 M\u03a9 for melanosomes. Standard pipette/lumen solutions contained (mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 MES, 10 glucose; pH 4.6 for endolysosomes and pH 6.8 for melanosomes, unless otherwise stated.

NMDG-based solutions were used in some experiments to block endogenous cation permeabilities. The holding potential was 0 mV and currents were measured in response to 500 ms voltage ramps from \u2212100 to +100 mV, unless otherwise stated. Whole-organelle current density was calculated by normalizing to capacitance (0.14\u20130.5 pF for melanosomes, 0.24\u20131.2 pF for endolyosomes). Single-channel current amplitudes were measured from the middle of the noise band between closed and open states or calculated from the difference between Gaussian-fitted closed and open peaks on all-points amplitude histograms for each excised patch record. To determine if I<sub>OCA2</sub> passes Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> electrodiffusively, reversal potential (E<sub>rev</sub>) was measured using 48 mM luminal Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> and variable cytoplasmic [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>] and compared with E<sub>rev</sub> predicted by the Nernst potential for Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>: E<sub>Cl</sub> = (RT/zF)ln([Cl<sub>luminal</sub>]/[Cl<sub>cytoplasmic</sub>]).

The authors start with a guess \u2013 that OCA2, an unknown-function membrane protein whose genetic disruption leads to albinism \u2013 might contribute to melanosome physiology. Accordingly, they heterologously express OCA2 in mammalian cells, showing that the protein is directed to the endolysosomes, and in exceedingly challenging patch-recording experiments document a new current appearing in dissected lysosomes. They carry out a thorough characterization of this voltage-dependent, Cl- selective current, showing that it is reduced by certain mutations associated with albinism. Moreover, they detect a similar current endogenous to melanosomes from a melanocyte cell line. The biological function of this current is addressed by experiments showing that heterologous expression of OCA2 leads to pH regulation in lysosomes similar to that known for melanosomes in melanocytes, and effect that albinism mutants fail to produce. Moreover, they show that proper pH regulation in the melanocyte line is suppressed by OCA2 siRNA."

As the reviewer indicates, this is because of the extreme difficulty of the experiments. We agree that increasing the n for the negative control would make our claim statistically stronger. In response to this, we added more recordings from cytoplasmic-side-out patches from dissected mock-transfected endolysosomes, included in a new supplemental figure (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). In this figure we show all six negative control recordings, none of which has currents similar to those measured in all eight of the OCA2-expressing cells and dermal melanosomes. We also plotted all-points amplitude histograms for each recording and graphed the average maximal amplitudes obtained from Gaussian fits of each amplitude histogram for each recording. These data are very consistent and, we believe, convincing that the single channels recorded require OCA2 expression."

But neither of the two values, Vm nor E<sub>Cl</sub>, has been unequivocally determined. In support of the assumption that Vm &gt; E<sub>Cl</sub>, the lysosomal membrane potential has been estimated to be in the -30 \u2013 -10 mV range (Koivusalo et al., Traffic 2011; Steinberg et al., JCB 2010; Sonawane et al., JBC 2002, Cang et al., Cell 2013) and E<sub>Cl</sub> is likely to be in the range of the typical plasma membrane value of -60mV, based on estimates of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> concentrations in lysosomes and the cytosol (Steinberg et al., JCB 2010). Under our normal experimental conditions ([Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]<sub>in</sub> = 150 mM, [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]<sub>out</sub> = 10 mM) E<sub>Cl</sub> = -68 mV. In support of the second scenario (Vm &lt; ECl), the Brilliant laboratory found the melanosomes of OCA2-deficient mice to be less acidic compared with WT using DAMP and anti-DNP staining (Puri et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000). However, this change in pH cannot be directly attributed to the absence of a Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> conductance mediated by OCA2 because these melanosomes have biogenesis and maturation defects and are likely to lack other proteins important for pH and membrane voltage regulation."

The effect of the Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> conductance on the pH of the lumen could be a more complex mechanism mediated by additional channels and transporters. It is possible that melanosomes may have voltage-sensitive channels or enzymes, similar to endolysosomes (Cang et al., Nature Chem. Biol. 2014), which could be affected by OCA2 to regulate pH. In endolysosomes expressing OCA2, other ion channels might become regulated by heterologous OCA2 (TRPML, TPC, etc.) to indirectly modulate pH. In melanosomes, there are a number of membrane proteins with predicted ion transport function (SLC45A2, SLC24A5, etc.) that could contribute to this pathway by directly transporting H<sup>+</sup> or by modulating H<sup>+</sup> transport mechanisms. Because endolysosomes and melanosomes express different proteins that contribute to ion transport and might have different Vm, in addition to the hypothesized different luminal pH, it is also possible that OCA2 expression does not have the same effect on the pH of endolysosomes compared to the pH of melanosomes. Thus, until we better understand melanosome membrane conductance and signaling, our model depicting pH regulation by OCA2 remains highly speculative."

We speculate that the high expression levels could mask a mild defect in localization to melanosomes or in protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is also possible that the K614E mutation, found in a conserved cytoplasmic loop, affects the regulation of OCA2 function via an unknown mechanism present in the cytoplasm, which is lost during organelle dissection. But we have no way of addressing this concern in a more effective way."
