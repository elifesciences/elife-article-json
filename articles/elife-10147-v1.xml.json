A molecular complex scaffolded by the GK protein-interaction domain (GK<sub>PID</sub>) mediates spindle orientation in diverse animal taxa by linking microtubule motor proteins to a marker protein on the cell cortex localized by external cues. Here we illuminate how this complex evolved and commandeered control of spindle orientation from a more ancient mechanism. The complex was assembled through a series of molecular exploitation events, one of which \u2013 the evolution of GK<sub>PID</sub>\u2019s capacity to bind the cortical marker protein \u2013 can be recapitulated by reintroducing a single historical substitution into the reconstructed ancestral GK<sub>PID</sub>. This change revealed and repurposed an ancient molecular surface that previously had a radically different function. We show how the physical simplicity of this binding interface enabled the evolution of a new protein function now essential to the biological complexity of many animals."

A molecular complex scaffolded by the GK protein-interaction domain (GK<sub>PID</sub>) mediates spindle orientation in diverse animal taxa by linking microtubule motor proteins to a marker protein on the cell cortex localized by external cues. Here we illuminate how this complex evolved and commandeered control of spindle orientation from a more ancient mechanism. The complex was assembled through a series of molecular exploitation events, one of which \u2013 the evolution of GK<sub>PID</sub>\u2019s capacity to bind the cortical marker protein \u2013 can be recapitulated by reintroducing a single historical substitution into the reconstructed ancestral GK<sub>PID</sub>. This change revealed and repurposed an ancient molecular surface that previously had a radically different function. We show how the physical simplicity of this binding interface enabled the evolution of a new protein function now essential to the biological complexity of many animals."

When the spindle is not oriented properly, malformed tissues and cancer can result. In a diverse range of animals, the orientation of the spindle is controlled by an ancient scaffolding protein that links the spindle to \u201cmarker\u201d proteins on the edge of the cell."

Anderson et al. did this by computationally retracing the evolution of large numbers of present-day scaffolding protein sequences down the tree of life, into the deep past. Living cells were then made to produce the ancient proteins, allowing their properties to be experimentally examined."

This new ability evolved by a number of \u201cmolecular exploitation\u201d events, which repurposed parts of the protein for new roles. The progenitor of the scaffolding protein was actually an enzyme, but the evolution of its spindle-orienting ability can be recapitulated by introducing a single amino acid change that happened many hundreds of millions of years ago."

Anderson et al. found that the ancient scaffolding protein uses the same part of its surface to bind to the spindle-orienting molecular marker as the ancient enzyme used to bind to its target substrate molecule, and the two partner molecules happen to share certain key chemical properties. This fortuitous resemblance between two unrelated molecules thus set the stage for the simple evolution of a function that is now essential to the complexity of multicellular animals."

Multicellularity \u2013 defined as the differentiation and spatial arrangement of cell types into functioning tissues within an integrated organism \u2013 evolved independently in several eukaryotic lineages, using unique mechanisms each time to drive the cellular functions necessary for tissue organization (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rokas, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">De Smet and Beeckman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Trillo and Nedelcu, 2015</a>). Comparative analyses have established that many protein families involved in cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cell differentiation in modern animals first appeared in the genomes of unicellular eukaryotes that were progenitors of animals (<a href=\"#bib33\">King, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nichols et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Richter and King, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rokas, 2008</a>). Virtually nothing is known, however, concerning the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins\u2019 functions evolved. These events happened in the deep past, so horizontal comparisons between extant species are often not sufficient to establish the historical changes in protein sequence, function, or biophysical properties that caused them. Vertical evolutionary analysis using ancestral protein reconstruction \u2013 phylogenetic inference of ancestral sequences followed by gene synthesis, genetic manipulation, and experimental characterization \u2013 has proven to be an effective strategy for elucidating these questions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Harms and Thornton, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Harms and Thornton, 2013</a>). Here, we apply ancestral protein reconstruction to investigate the historical trajectory, timing, and mechanisms of evolution of a new protein function important to organized multicellularity in diverse animal phyla."

In this complex, the scaffold is the GK protein interaction domain (GK<sub>PID</sub>) of the protein Discs large (Dlg), which binds microtubule-associated motor proteins, such as the kinesin-3 family member KHC-73, and the Partner of Inscuteable protein (Pins in insects, LGN in vertebrates). In neuroblasts, the complex is localized relative to the position of adjacent cells by the interaction of a transmembrane receptor \u2013 which receives local extracellular signals \u2013 with Pins, which in turn recruits GK<sub>PID</sub>, KHC-73, and the spindle microtubules (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yoshiura et al., 2012</a>). In epithelia, in contrast, localization of the complex relative to surrounding cells appears to be mediated by Dlg itself; Pins is then recruited into the complex via interaction with Dlg\u2019s GK<sub>PID</sub>. In addition to serving as a localized molecular mark in some cell types, Pins also brings other proteins to the complex, including Mud/Numa and its partners, which generate pulling forces and reinforce proper spindle orientation once it is established by the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lu and Johnston, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Johnston et al., 2009</a>). Other molecules and pathways may be important in spindle orientation in other kinds of cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morin and Bella\u00efche, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lu and Johnston, 2013</a>), and further work is required to comprehensively assess the generality of the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex\u2019s role in spindle orientation across cell types and in the most basal animal lineages. Nevertheless, the fact that the GK<sub>PID</sub>-mediated complex orients the mitotic spindle in multiple cell types in both protostomes and deuterostomes suggests an ancient and essential role in the biology of complex animals. Indeed, compromising Dlg\u2019s GK<sub>PID</sub> or other components of the Pins-Dlg-KHC-73 complex affects numerous tissues and cell types by causing impaired spindle orientation, tumorigenesis plasia, defects in cell polarity and differentiation, and developmental failures of tissue organization (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nakajima et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Johnston et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Siegrist and Doe, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bergstralh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yoshiura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bilder, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Woods, 1996</a>)."

Spindle orientation itself is not a metazoan novelty; indeed, most eukaryotes \u2013 even unicellular ones \u2013 orient the mitotic spindle, but most appear to do so relative to the cell\u2019s internal structure alone rather than in response to cues from adjacent cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 2003</a>). We visualized the mitotic spindle in colonial <i>S. rosetta</i> using fluorescence microscopy and found that dividing <i>S. rosetta</i> cells appear to orient their mitotic spindles relative to the surface of the colony in a way that maintains the colony\u2019s spherical geometry (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). If GK<sub>PID</sub> and Pins do not associate in choanoflagellates, how do colonial cells accomplish this? <i>S. rosetta</i> cells form colonies in a flagellum-out fashion, so orienting the spindle relative to the colony surface also entails orienting it at a right angle to the axis of the flagellum and, more generally, to the apical-basal (A-B) axis of the cell. We found that individual dividing <i>S. rosetta</i> cells that are not organized into colonies also orient their spindles relative to the flagellum and the A-B axis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Because spindle orientation relative to the cellular axis occurs in both colonial and noncolonial <i>S. rosetta</i> cells, spindle orientation is likely to involve internal marks imposed by the cell\u2019s polarity rather than cues from neighboring cells."

This more ancient mechanism may have involved the flagellar basal bodies. The deeper choanoflagellate-metazoan ancestor almost certainly had flagella (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nielsen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buss, 1988</a>). Previous research indicates that during choanoflagellate mitosis, the flagellar basal body duplicates; the daughter bodies migrate symmetrically away from the cell\u2019s basal pole and then serve as microtubule organizing centers for assembling the spindle and orienting it perpendicular to the A-B axis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buss, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Leadbeater, 2015</a>). A parsimonious hypothesis is therefore that spindle orientation in the choanoflagellate-animal ancestor was oriented relative to the A-B axis via the position of the flagellar basal bodies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buss, 1988</a>). This ancient mechanism would have been retained in choanoflagellates, allowing organized cell division in the context of flagellum-out spherical colonies. Along the branch leading to the metazoan ancestor, basal-body mediated orientation would have been replaced by the GK<sub>PID</sub>-Pins association, providing a mechanism for the spindle to be oriented relative to adjacent cells via an externally organized molecular mark as the flagellum was lost from many animal cell types."

Upon nucleotide binding, the lobes move inward and occupy a closed conformation, bringing GMP and its co-substrate ATP together and allowing catalysis to occur (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sekulic et al., 2002</a>).

Homology models of the ancestral proteins, as well as the structures of extant family members, indicate that the key portion of the Pins-binding surface of GK<sub>PID</sub> was derived without significant modification from the ancient surface that gk enzymes use to bind GMP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This GMP-binding site could be repurposed for binding Pins because the two ligands \u2013 one a nucleotide, the other a peptide -- share a key structural feature: a negatively charged head flanked by a small hydrophobic region (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, ref. <a href=\"#bib29\">Johnston, et al., 2012</a>). Specifically, the phosphate group at the head of GMP is anchored to the enzyme with hydrogen bonds to four clustered residues that form a positively charged pocket (R40, R43, Y80, Y82); in the GK<sub>PID</sub>, these same residues form hydrogen bonds to the phosphate group of Pins\u2019 phospho-serine 436. At the other end of GMP, the hydrophobic guanosine ring occupies a hydrophobic groove in the enzyme, and the same groove on the GK<sub>PID</sub> binds to a hydrophobic methionine side chain on Pins. Additional interactions beyond this common interface are required for Pins binding (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>), but the physical interactions are relatively simple, including a series of small hydrophobic patches that bind to hydrophobic side chains on Pins and just two additional hydrogen bonds, both from backbone atoms on Pins to polar residues on the GK<sub>PID</sub> surface that were solvent-exposed in the enzyme. Thus, the fortuitous similarity between GMP and one portion of Pins, along with the fortuitous arrangement of hydrophobic patches near the ancestral enzyme\u2019s GMP-binding site, made it possible for GK<sub>PID</sub> to evolve Pins binding by a very minor genetic modification."

Several lines of evidence suggest that these substitutions altered the protein\u2019s dynamics and/or increased the relative occupancy of a conformation in which the latent binding site is exposed for peptide binding. First, the hinge where these two residues are located (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7B</a>) is known to mediate the dynamic opening/closing of the binding lobes relative to each other (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blaszczyk et al., 2001</a>). Second, the degree to which the domain is open or closed appears to be essential for function. In gk enzymes, closing is critical for catalysis, because it brings the nucleotide substrates close together in the protected active site (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhabha et al., 2013</a>); in GK<sub>PID</sub>s, however, open conformations appear to be required for Pins binding, because the Pins peptide is significantly larger and is therefore predicted to sterically clash with the GK<sub>PID</sub> when the lobes are close together. Third, substituting a proline at position 36 could restrict backbone dihedral angles in the hinge, possibly altering the dynamics of the hinge and/or the distribution of conformations it occupies. Replacing the bulky phenylalanine at position 36 could also change backbone dynamics, altering the occupancy of conformations in this region. Fourth, introducing a proline at residue 36 into extant gk enzymes has been shown to impede the GMP-induced closing motion, abolish enzyme activity, and to confer Pins binding (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnston et al., 2011</a>). Because the effects of mutation s36P on the function of the ancestral gk enzyme are nearly identical to those it has on the extant enzyme, it is likely that similar biophysical mechanisms pertain in the two proteins. Fifth, engineering yet a third mutation in the hinge \u2013 a serine-to-proline replacement at site 34 \u2013 into extant gk enzymes has been previously found to reduce enzyme activity, confer spindle orientation, and impede conformational closing, further supporting a causal link between these phenomena (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnston et al., 2011</a>)."

This scenario is consistent with recent findings that changes in conformational occupancy may play an important role in the evolution of protein function (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harms et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</a>). Subsequent substitutions apparently fine-tuned Pins-binding affinity, yielding the higher-affinity Anc-GK1<sub>PID</sub> and Anc-GK2<sub>PID</sub>. In addition to its likely effects on conformational occupancy and/or dynamics, Pro36 makes van der Waals contact to the Pins ligand (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), so it is possible that s36P may also have contributed to optimizing the latent Pins binding interface itself; in contrast, f33S does not contact the ligand and is therefore unlikely to have directly affected the interface."

Nearly all of the data and cited literature is specific to <i>Drosophila</i>. For instance, in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> it appears that the PINS of Worm (presumably <i>C. elegans</i>?) doesn't even have the phosphoserine posited to be recognized by GK<sub>PID</sub>, although worms obviously orient their spindles. Other pathways have been implicated in oriented cell division. One reviewer notes that, \"cell division in early embryos follows Hertwig's rule (i.e. that cells tend to divide along their long access) and it has been argued that Myosin activity is the primary determinant of the division plane in <i>C. elegans</i> neuroblasts. I am unaware of evidence that those two phenomena are primarily caused by GK<sub>PID</sub>.\" Another reviewer notes that, \"Even in the <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cell induced cell polarity assay, the function of this complex is mostly studied in the context of TPR-deleted PINS. TPR-deleted PINS cannot bind Mud (NuMA). The PINS/MUD pathway IS highly conserved in multiple phyla. I would be happy if the authors could cite high quality data for a spindle positioning role for KHC73:DLG:PINS in ONE additional phylum other than Arthropoda. There are many papers on the mammalian scribbled polarity complex. Polarity is not the same thing as spindle orientation.\" We do not expect you to undertake new experiments to test the essentiality of GK<sub>PID</sub> for oriented cell division across all animals, but it is absolutely essential to make substantial textual changes to reflect the fact that although current evidence indicates that GK<sub>PID</sub> is an important mechanism for spindle orientation in some organisms, neither your data nor the literature currently support it being a universal mechanism in metazoans."

First, this section should include data about the number of cells analyzed. Second, the following statement seems to be more of a hypothesis than a fully supported claim: \"During mitosis, the flagellar basal body duplicates; the daughter bodies migrate symmetrically away from the cell's basal pole and then serve as microtubule organizing centers for assembling the spindle and orienting it perpendicular to the A-B axis, a process that may or may not involve GK<sub>PID</sub>. Because this mode of spindle orientation relative to the cellular axis occurs in both colonial and non-colonial <i>S. rosetta</i> cells, it must involve internal marks imposed by the cell's polarity rather than cues from neighboring cells.\" Unless you are prepared to undertake substantial new experiments to fully demonstrate that the basal bodies are in fact the organizing centers, this statement and similar ones should be dramatically tempered."

We do not think this is an artifact, as your ancestral reconstruction samples broadly across species and the result is robust to the reconstruction \u2013 so this somewhat puzzling finding does appear to be true. It may be impossible to explain exactly why this occurred, but more discussion of this conundrum is warranted. Why should the ancestral and Choanoflagellate GK<sub>PID</sub> bind a <i>Drosophila</i> PINS but not the PINS in that same organism? This question is going to come up in the mind of every reader, so your best guesses at plausible explanations would be helpful."

Other pathways have been implicated in oriented cell division. One reviewer notes that, \"cell division in early embryos follows Hertwig's rule (i.e. that cells tend to divide along their long access) and it has been argued that Myosin activity is the primary determinant of the division plane in</i> C. elegans <i>neuroblasts. I am unaware of evidence that those two phenomena are primarily caused by GK<sub>PID</sub>.\" Another reviewer notes that, \"Even in the</i> Drosophila <i>S2 cell induced cell polarity assay, the function of this complex is mostly studied in the context of TPR-deleted PINS. TPR-deleted PINS cannot bind Mud (NuMA). The PINS/MUD pathway IS highly conserved in multiple phyla. I would be happy if the authors could cite high quality data for a spindle positioning role for KHC73:DLG:PINS in ONE additional phylum other than Arthropoda. There are many papers on the mammalian scribbled polarity complex. Polarity is not the same thing as spindle orientation.\" We do not expect you to undertake new experiments to test the essentiality of GK<sub>PID</sub> for oriented cell division across all animals, but it is absolutely essential to make substantial textual changes to reflect the fact that although current evidence indicates that GK<sub>PID</sub> is an important mechanism for spindle orientation in some organisms, neither your data nor the literature currently support it being a universal mechanism in metazoans.</i> "

The role of the GK<sub>PID</sub> complex in spindle orientation in both protostomes and deuterostomes and in multiple cell types suggests an ancient and general role. However, this does not mean that the role of GK<sub>PID</sub> is the universal mediator of spindle orientation in all animal cells: other mechanisms may be important in certain taxonomic lineages and cell types, and we have changed the text to explicitly address these points.
