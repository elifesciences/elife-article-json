Their translocation domain is a large \u03b2-barrel occluded by a plug domain, which is displaced to allow the translocation of pilus subunits across the membrane. Previous studies suggested that this gating mechanism is controlled by a \u03b2-hairpin and an \u03b1-helix. To investigate the role of these elements in allosteric signal communication we developed a method combining evolutionary and molecular dynamics studies of the native translocation domain and mutants lacking the \u03b2-hairpin and/or \u03b1-helix. Analysis of a hybrid residue interaction network suggests distinct regions (residue 'communities') within the translocation domain (especially around \u03b212-\u03b214) linking these elements, thereby modulating PapC gating. Antibiotic sensitivity and electrophysiology experiments on a set of alanine-substitution mutants confirmed functional roles for four of these communities. This study illuminates the gating mechanism of PapC ushers and its importance in maintaining outer-membrane permeability."
