Here, we unveil <span class=\"underline\">n</span>erve <span class=\"underline\">g</span>rowth <span class=\"underline\">f</span>actor <span class=\"underline\">r</span>eceptor (NGFR, p75NTR or CD271) as a novel p53 inactivator. p53 activates NGFR transcription, whereas NGFR inactivates p53 by promoting its MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and by directly binding to its central DNA binding domain and preventing its DNA-binding activity. Inversely, NGFR ablation activates p53, consequently inducing apoptosis, attenuating survival, and reducing clonogenic capability of cancer cells, as well as sensitizing human cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents that induce p53 and suppressing mouse xenograft tumor growth. NGFR is highly expressed in human glioblastomas, and its gene is often amplified in breast cancers with wild type p53. Altogether, our results demonstrate that cancers hijack NGFR as an oncogenic inhibitor of p53."

Here, we unveil <span class=\"underline\">n</span>erve <span class=\"underline\">g</span>rowth <span class=\"underline\">f</span>actor <span class=\"underline\">r</span>eceptor (NGFR, p75NTR or CD271) as a novel p53 inactivator. p53 activates NGFR transcription, whereas NGFR inactivates p53 by promoting its MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and by directly binding to its central DNA binding domain and preventing its DNA-binding activity. Inversely, NGFR ablation activates p53, consequently inducing apoptosis, attenuating survival, and reducing clonogenic capability of cancer cells, as well as sensitizing human cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents that induce p53 and suppressing mouse xenograft tumor growth. NGFR is highly expressed in human glioblastomas, and its gene is often amplified in breast cancers with wild type p53. Altogether, our results demonstrate that cancers hijack NGFR as an oncogenic inhibitor of p53."

MDM2 inhibits p53 activity primarily by binding to and concealing the N-terminal transcriptional activation (TA) domain of p53 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Oliner et al., 1993</a>) and by mediating its poly-ubiquitination and proteolysis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fuchs et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haupt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kubbutat et al., 1997</a>). Genetically, disruption of the <i>TP53</i> gene completely rescues the lethal phenotype of Mdm2 knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jones et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Montes de Oca Luna et al., 1995</a>). A myriad of stresses can orchestrate this MDM2-p53 feedback loop. The ARF tumor suppressor directly associates with MDM2 and inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation upon oncogenic stress (<a href=\"#bib49\">Palmero et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zindy et al., 1998</a>). Also, several ribosomal proteins boost p53 activation by untying the MDM2-p53 loop in response to ribosomal or nucleolar stress (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang and Lu, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">2015a</a>). But, oncogenic proteins can enhance MDM2 E3 ligase activity towards p53. MDMX (also called MDM4), the MDM2 homologue, can enhance MDM2-mediated p53 proteasomal degradation by binding to MDM2, besides directly interacting with p53 and repressing its activity (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shvarts et al., 1996</a>). High expression of MDM2 and MDMX in several cancers, such as breast cancer and melanoma, is often considered as the reason why these cancers sustain wild type (wt) p53 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wade et al., 2013</a>), but this could only account for a portion of wt p53-harboring cancers. Thus, it is still unknown if there are other proteins that can also suppress p53 function in the remaining cancers."

NGFR is a 75 kD single-transmembrane protein without kinase activity and widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barker, 2004</a>). Often partnering with other receptors, such as TrkA, it is involved in a multitude of processes during neurogenesis, such as neural cell death, neuronal differentiation, neurite growth, and synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barker, 2004</a>). Also, the NGF-NGFR cascade activates NF-\u03baB, leading to inhibition of apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carter et al., 1996</a>) and increased survival of schwannoma (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gentry et al., 2000</a>) and breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Descamps et al., 2001</a>).

As detailed below, we surprisingly found that NGFR inactivates p53 by directly binding to its central DNA-binding domain and preventing its association with its target promoters and by enhancing its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and proteolysis. This function is ligand-independent because it occurred in the nucleus and without ligand treatment of cancer cells. Biologically, cancer cells hijack the negative feedback regulation of p53 by NGFR to their growth advantage, as down regulation of NGFR induced p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest as well as suppressed tumor growth. Furthermore, NGFR was found to be highly expressed in 68.75% (33/48) of human gliomas examined. Consistently, NGFR is amplified in breast cancers that harbor wt TP53 based on the TCGA database (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cerami et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2013</a>). Hence, our discovery of NGFR as another feedback suppressor of p53 could explain why some cancers sustain wt p53 and also suggest NGFR as a potential target for the development of new anti-cancer therapy."

To confirm this result, we treated three types of p53-containing cancer cell lines (HCT116<sup>p53+/+</sup>, H460 and HepG2) with INZ, Doxorubicin (Dox) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). The expression of <i>NGFR</i> mRNA was drastically elevated by all the three agents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B and C</a>). Consistently, NGFR protein level increased in response to Dox or 5-FU treatment in p53-intact, but not p53-null (HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup>) or mutated (PCL/PRF/5), cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a>).

Thus, we re-determined the role of NGFR in cancer cell growth and proliferation and whether this role is p53-dependent. Surprisingly, knockdown of NGFR elicited significant apoptosis of H460 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>) and HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>) cells as measured by flow cytometric analyses, consequently reducing cell viability during the 4-day culture (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E and F</a>). To verify if NGFR supports tumor cell growth and proliferation and to see if this role is p53-dependent, we performed colony formation assays by knocking down NGFR in p53-containing H460 and p53-deficient H1299 cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). NGFR ablation more dramatically repressed the colony formation of H460 cells than that of H1299 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This result suggests that NGFR may support cancer cell survival through both p53-dependent and independent mechanisms. Since NGFR was found to be required for nerve growth factor-mediated NF-\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carter et al., 1996</a>), knockdown of NGFR in H1299 may impair NF-\u03baB activation, thus leading to partially restrained cell viability and reduced colonies. Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of human gliomas and their adjacent normal tissues exhibited hyperexpression of NGFR in the tumor tissues (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Consistently, NGFR was more highly expressed in human glioma tissues compared to adjacent tissues as determined by immunoblotting (IB) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that NGFR promotes cancer cell growth and proliferation, likely in part by inactivating p53."

Indeed, p53 level induced by Dox or 5-FU was markedly reduced by ectopic NGFR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Inversely, knockdown of NGFR strikingly elevated the level of endogenous p53 and that of its target genes p21 and PUMA in human p53-containing H460, HepG2, neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, melanoma SK-MEL-103 and SK-MEL-147 and HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), whereas did not affect PUMA expression in HCT116 <sup>p53-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistently, knockdown of NGFR led to the global expression of a group of known p53 target genes, as measured by RNA-seq analysis in H460 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This result was further confirmed by utilizing a second siRNA (siNGFR#2), as NGFR knockdown by this siRNA also induced the protein level of p53 and the mRNA levels of its target genes, including BAX, BTG2, MDM2, p21, and PUMA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Also, ablation of NGFR prolonged p53\u2019s half-life (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), suggesting that NGFR might regulate the stability of p53. Next, we tested if NGFR affects MDM2-induced p53 ubiquitination by conducting a p53 ubiquitination assay in H1299 cells with ectopic proteins. Surprisingly, ectopic NGFR enhanced MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), although this protein was found to mainly reside in the cytoplasmic membrane (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barker, 2004</a>). Consistently, NGFR also enhanced MDM2-mediated p53 proteasomal degradation, which was abolished by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Without MDM2, NGFR was unable to alter p53 protein level in cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

Indeed, ectopic NGFR bound to ectopic MDM2, and vice versa (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We then mapped their binding domains by performing a set of co-IP and GST-pull down assays. NGFR was specifically pulled down with the C-terminal aa 284\u2013491 fragment, but not N-terminal fragments, of MDM2, which encompasses the zinc-finger, acidic, and ring-finger domains, in H1299 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This result was verified by in vitro GST-pull down assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Using the same approach, we also mapped the MDM2-binding domain of NGFR. Unexpectedly, MDM2 interacted with the N-terminal extracellular and transmembrane domain, but not the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, of NGFR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Also, we validated the interaction between endogenous NGFR and MDM2 in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells that sustains high level of NGFR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). To determine if this interaction takes place in the nucleus, we used H460 cells stably expressing NGFR, HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> and SK-MEL-147 cells, fractionated them, and conducted IB assays. Indeed, full-length NGFR was present in both cytoplasm and nucleus (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Consistently, confocal microscopy analysis revealed that NGFR is present in all of the cellular compartments of SK-MEL-147 cells, albeit with less intensity in the nucleus than that in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Of note, the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of NGFR increased upon Dox treatment likely due to p53 activation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Also, NGFR was co-immunoprecipitated with MDM2 from the nuclear extracts of NGFR-stably expressed H460 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>) and SK-MEL-147 cells in a reciprocal pattern (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). Hence, these results demonstrate that the N-terminus of NGFR binds to the C-terminus of MDM2, and this interaction occurs in the nucleus."

Thus, we tested if p53 binds to NGFR directly or indirectly through MDM2. First, we conducted co-IP-IB and GST-Pull down assays. Indeed, NGFR and p53 co-immunoprecipitated with each other in reciprocal co-IP-IB assays (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>). Further confirming this interaction was the mapping of the NGFR-binding domain to the central DNA-binding domain of p53 using a similar co-IP-IB assay by transfecting plasmids encoding individual p53 fragments together with NGFR plasmid into H1299 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This mapping was validated by a GST-pull down assay using purified GST-p53 fusion proteins with different p53 fragments. NGFR specifically bound to the full-length p53 and its central DNA-binding domain (aa 101\u2013300) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This finding explained why NGFR, MDM2 and p53 could form a ternary complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013k</a>). We also mapped the p53-binding domain of NGFR by conducting a set of co-IP-IB assays. Like MDM2, p53 also bound to the N-terminal region of NGFR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Together with the result showing that NGFR binds to p53 in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I\u2013K</a>), these results demonstrate that the N-terminus of NGFR binds to the central DNA-binding domain of p53, and this interaction also occurs in the nucleus."

To test this idea, we first determined if NGFR can bind to p53 in the absence of MDM2 by introducing their expression plasmids alone or together into MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-;p53-/-</sup> cells followed by co-IP-IB assays. Indeed, NGFR was co-immunoprecipitated with p53 in these cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Interestingly and as also mentioned above, ectopic NGFR at different doses failed to decrease the level of ectopic p53 in MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-;p53-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting that NGFR cannot directly degrade p53 without MDM2. Then, we tested if NGFR could regulate p53 transcriptional activity in the absence of MDM2 by performing luciferase reporter assays. Interestingly, ectopic NGFR inhibited p53-induced luciferase activity driven by the miR-34a promoter in MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-;p53-/-</sup> cells in a dose dependent fashion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Also, NGFR repressed ectopic p53-induced expression of p21 and Puma in MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-;p53-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Consistently, ectopic NGFR markedly reduced the association of p53 with the endogenous p21 and Bax promoters in these cells as analyzed by ChIP assays in H1299 or MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-;p53-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Since MDMX, the partner of MDM2, also bound to NGFR (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), MEF<sup>Mdm2-/-; Mdmx-/-; p53-/-</sup> cells were used to determine if MDMX is required for p53 inactivation by NGFR. NGFR still inhibited p53 activity as measured by p21 and Puma expression (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NGFR also inhibits p53 by directly binding to its central DNA-binding domain and preventing its association with its target promoter."

We tested this idea by treating H460 and SK-N-SH cells with different doses of Dox and Cisplatin after introducing control or NGFR siRNAs into the cells. Indeed, both of the chemotherapeutic drugs induced p53 and its target PUMA or p21 more apparently when the cells were transfected with NGFR siRNA compared to those with control siRNA in a dose-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>). Also, this more robust p53 induction led to more cytotoxicity, as the IC50 of Cisplatin in NGFR siRNA-transfected H460 was 2.2-fold less than that in control siRNA-transfected H460 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). The result was repeated in HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> cells, in which the IC50 of Cisplatin dropped by 1.6 folds in response to NGFR knockdown (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). This enhanced cytotoxicity was p53-dependent, as less\u00a0or\u00a0no significant difference in cell viability was observed when p53-null H1299 or HCT116 <sup>p53-/-</sup> cells were used for the same experiment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F and H</a>).

NGFR shRNA or control shRNA-packaged lentivirus was produced to infect H460 and SK-MEL-147 cells. As expected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), the expression of p53 and its target genes p21, PUMA, and MDM2 was induced by knocking down NGFR using the shRNA-expressing lentiviruses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Correspondingly, H460 cells with deficient NGFR grew slowly (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) and formed less colonies (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). In line with this result, the xenograft tumors derived from NGFR-shRNA H460 cells grew remarkably slower than those from control-shRNAH460 cells in the SCID mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Also, the average tumor weight from control cells was ~ten-fold heavier than that from NGFR-shRNA cells by the end of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Tumors derived from NGFR-shRNA H460 cells are much smaller than those derived from control-shRNA H460 cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Because of the diminutive size of the tumors generated from the NGFR knockdown group, we were unable to collect sufficient amounts of tumor tissues for WB and IHC staining. But, by performing q-PCR analysis, we found that the expression of p21, PUMA, and MDM2 is significantly elevated in response to NGFR depletion in the xenograft tumors (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>), consistent with the in vitro results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>).

NGFR inhibited p53 transcriptional activity as a feedback regulator in the nucleus of several cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>), even though it normally resides in the cellular membrane of a neuron in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barker, 2004</a>).

Also, NGFR was highly expressed in human gliomas\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H and I</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In addition to the xenograft model generated by human lung non-small cell carcinoma H460 cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), NGFR has also been shown by others to enhance cell survival of schwannoma (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gentry et al., 2000</a>), melanoma (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boiko et al., 2010</a>), and breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib14\">Descamps et al., 2001</a>), and to promote metastasis of glioma (<a href=\"#bib24\">Johnston et al., 2007</a>), melanoma (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boiko et al., 2010</a>), and head and neck cancers (<a href=\"#bib44\">Murillo-Sauca et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). Most of these cancers harbor wt p53 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Soussi et al., 2005</a> and IRAC TP53 database, R17). Analysis of the TCGA genomic database also showed that the NGFR gene is often\u00a0amplified in human breast cancers that display no p53 mutation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cerami et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Hence, our study highly suggests that NGFR plays an oncogenic role by targeting p53 in these human cancers that harbor wt p53. Also, our study leads to several new findings to the p53 field."

Also, overexpression of wt, but not mutant, p53 stimulated the expression of NGFR in p53-null cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F and G</a>). In addition, knockdown of p53 in HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> and H460 impaired the induction of NGFR mRNA by Dox and 5-FU (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H and I</a>). Furthermore, p53 stimulated the expression of luciferase gene driven by the p53RE sequence derived from the NGFR promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013L</a>). Finally, in response to Dox, p53 was induced to associate with the p53RE-containing NGFR promoter in H460 cells. Undoubtedly, <i>NGFR</i> is an authentic p53 target gene, which is also in line with a recent finding that NGFR is a transcriptional target for the p53 analog, p73, in the mouse nerve system (<a href=\"#bib45\">Niklison-Chirou et al., 2013</a>)."

Also, knockdown of NGFR led to a more significant decrease of colony formation in p53-containing H460 cells compared to p53-deficient H1299 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Of note, the suppressive effect of NGFR knockdown on H1299 colony formation might be due to the oncogenic function of this protein via other oncoproteins, such as NF-\u03baB (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carter et al., 1996</a>). But, this result does not affect our conclusion that negation of p53 function is one of the oncogenic functions of NGFR, as it is strongly supported by the evidence that knockdown of NGFR leads to activation of the p53 pathway in H460, HepG2, SK-N-SH, HCT116 <sup>p53+/+</sup> and melanoma SK-MEL cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). Remarkably, a number of p53 responsive target genes were induced to different degrees when NGFR was knocked down in H460 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The NGFR inhibition of p53 is further supported by the fact that it inactivates p53 by two distinct mechanisms as detailed below."

However, without MDM2, ectopic NGFR was unable to mediate p53 degradation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

Although a previous study showed that in response to neurotrophin signaling, NGFR might mediate p53-dependent neuron cell death by activating the JNK pathway (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aloyz et al., 1998</a>), our studies as presented here unveil a novel nuclear function of this membrane receptor, i.e., to promote cancer cell proliferation and survival by directly inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity and indirectly destabilizing p53 protein via MDM2. Convincingly, we showed that NGFR binds to MDM2 in the nucleus and assists this E3 ligase to ubiquitinate p53 and promote its degradation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>,<a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). Also, independently of MDM2, NGFR directly bound to the central domain of p53 in the nucleus and prevented p53 from binding to its target promoters (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>,<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). These inhibitory activities of NGFR toward p53 are ligand-independent, as they occurred in the nucleus and NGF treatment did not appear to affect p53 level and activity in H460, HCT116, and HepG2 cancer cells tested (Data not shown). Hence, our results for the first time uncover a ligand-independent and nuclear p53 inhibitory function of this membrane neurotrophic receptor by acting on the MDM2-p53 loop."

In line with our findings, a growing body of evidence has identified NGFR as a robust cell surface biomarker not only for neural crest stem cells, but also cancer initiating or stem-like cells (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tomellini et al., 2014</a>). Also, NGFR was highly expressed in a number of cancers, including the cancer initiating cells of melanoma (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boiko et al., 2010</a>), squamous cell carcinomas (<a href=\"#bib44\">Murillo-Sauca et al., 2014</a>), osteosarcoma (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tian et al., 2014</a>), brain cancer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Biagiotti et al., 2006</a>), breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2012</a>), and neuroblastoma (<a href=\"#bib4\">Biagiotti et al., 2006</a>). Particularly, patient derived NGFR-positive, but not NGFR-negative, melanoma cells were remarkably capable of generating tumors, promoting metastasis, and maintaining self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boiko et al., 2010</a>). Also, we detected the high expression of NGFR in several melanoma cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and primary human gliomas (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Several of these cancers, such as breast cancer, melanoma, osteocarcoma, and neuroblastoma, often display less or no TP53 mutations (<a href=\"#bib51\">Petitjean et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Soussi et al., 2005</a>). Although MDM2 and MDMX have been shown to play a role in suppressing p53 in these cancers (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gembarska et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lam et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Slack et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wade et al., 2013</a>), it is highly likely that NGFR might also contribute to the reason why these cancers harbor wt p53. Our findings as demonstrated here further support this likelihood and provide novel mechanisms underlying NGFR inactivation of p53 in these cancers or cancer stem cells. Together with the aforementioned studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boiko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tomellini et al., 2014</a>), our findings also suggest that NGFR might play a role in maintaining the renewal and proliferating capabilities of stem cells or cancer stem cells by inactivating p53, as p53 has been shown to be crucial for stem cell differentiation and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Krizhanovsky and Lowe, 2009</a>) and to be a major roadblock for these stem cells to renew and proliferate (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cicalese et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kawamura et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Marion et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Utikal et al., 2009</a>)."

All these studies did not notice the receptor-independent intracellular function of NGFR. Thus, our study not only offers new insights into the mechanism of intracellular NGFR-mediated tumor promotion, but also demonstrates that this oncogenic function is p53-dependent, which could explain why several human cancers that express high levels of NGFR harbor wt p53. Finally, our study suggests NGFR as a potential therapeutic target for cancers that harbor wt p53 and high levels of NGFR."

Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 3 x 10<sup>6\u00a0</sup>H460 cells infected with lentivirus encoding control shRNA or NGFR shRNA in the right and left flanks, respectively. Tumor growth was monitored every other day with electronic digital calipers (Thermo Scientific) in two dimensions. Tumor volume was calculated with the formula: tumor volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) = (length x width<sup>2</sup>)/2 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Mice were sacrificed by euthanasia and tumors were harvested and weighed. Mice with the largest or smallest tumor size were excluded from our study. To detect p53 activation and apoptotic signals in vivo, the tumors were disrupted in Trizol and subjected to RT-qPCR analyses."

In addition, the paper demonstrates that NGFR inactivates p53 transcriptional activity independent of MDM2 through its ability to bind to the central DNA-binding domain of p53, thereby diminishing its ability to bind target promoters. That NGFR has a role in the nucleus and forms a negative feedback loop with p53 is a unique observation. Data are also presented showing that NGFR is frequently overexpressed in human glioblastomas; thus the NGFR-mediated negative regulation of p53 may have important implications in glioblastoma biology and therapeutics."

The fractionation results need to be validated with immunostaining data. The evidence of NGFR overexpression in human glioma was very clear but the images depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> could not clearly show NGFR subcellular distribution.

This monoclonal antibody is produced by immunizing animals with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues surrounding Arg198 which locates in the extracellular domain of human NGFR. As expected and in line with our fractionation results (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>), we found that NGFR expression could be detected in the nucleus of all cells examined (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), although NGFR signals are more intensive in the cytoplasm and membrane than in the nucleus. While NGFR was originally found to be a transmembrane receptor in the neuronal cells, we have added new evidence that NGFR also resides in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cancer cells by cell fractionation and confocal microscopy analysis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results, taken together with other results as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>), strongly support our conclusion that cancer cells hijack NGFR to overcome the cytotoxic effect of p53. Interestingly, the nuclear expression of NGFR increased when genotoxic insult was triggered by Doxorubicin (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This elevated level of NGFR in the nucleus is likely due to p53 activation in response to Doxorubicin, as the NGFR gene is a p53 target gene. It is likely that the nuclear accumulated NGFR is to inactivate p53 thus inducing chemo-resistance of cancer cells, which is also consistent with our results shown in the <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>."

Also, it is more challenging to use currently available anti-NFFR antibodies for detailed IHC analysis of primary human cancers in order to distinguish NGFR in different subcellular compartments and to correlate its subcellular localization with different stages of human tumors or different types of tumors. Nevertheless, our studies as shown in this manuscript do confirm that nuclear NGFR can bind to p53 and MDM2, consequently inactivating p53 by directly inhibiting its transcriptional activity and facilitating MDM2-dependent ubiquitination and degradation."

In this case, we only detected either p21 or PUMA expression as an indication of p53 activity, since knockdown of NGFR has been shown to activate the p53 pathway markedly in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> with not only the WB data, but also the RNA-seq data. Because of the convincing reproducibility of these findings each time in each of our assays, we thus thought it is unnecessary to show p21 or Puma in all of the blots, such as <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>. However, convincingly, knockdown of NGFR can sensitize these cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin or doxorubicin, as tested here. This sensitization is more apparent in p53-positive cancer cells, though Doxorubicin could also induce p21 independently of p53."
