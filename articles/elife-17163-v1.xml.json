Here, we identify <i>QIL1</i> null alleles in two siblings displaying multiple clinical symptoms of early-onset fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy with liver disease, including defects in respiratory chain function in patient muscle. QIL1 absence in patients\u2019 fibroblasts was associated with MICOS disassembly, abnormal cristae, mild cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase defect, and sensitivity to glucose withdrawal. QIL1 expression rescued cristae defects, and promoted re-accumulation of MICOS subunits to facilitate MICOS assembly. MICOS assembly and cristae morphology were not efficiently rescued by over-expression of other MICOS subunits in patient fibroblasts. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence of altered MICOS assembly linked with a human mitochondrial disease and confirm a central role for QIL1 in stable MICOS complex formation."

Here, we identify <i>QIL1</i> null alleles in two siblings displaying multiple clinical symptoms of early-onset fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy with liver disease, including defects in respiratory chain function in patient muscle. QIL1 absence in patients\u2019 fibroblasts was associated with MICOS disassembly, abnormal cristae, mild cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase defect, and sensitivity to glucose withdrawal. QIL1 expression rescued cristae defects, and promoted re-accumulation of MICOS subunits to facilitate MICOS assembly. MICOS assembly and cristae morphology were not efficiently rescued by over-expression of other MICOS subunits in patient fibroblasts. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence of altered MICOS assembly linked with a human mitochondrial disease and confirm a central role for QIL1 in stable MICOS complex formation."

A central feature of mitochondrial disease is the pleotropic nature of phenotypes, with some diseases eliciting highly tissue-specific effects and others affecting multiple organ systems. The basis of this pleiotropy is poorly understood, but could reflect differences in mitochondrial structure and concomitant links with respiratory chain activity within individual tissues (<a href=\"#bib40\">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</a>)."

These laminar structures with highly curved distal membrane arrangement are formed through the mitochondrial contact site (MICOS)\u00a0complex, a cristae junction scaffold that is thought to both maintain close proximity of cristae membranes near the 'boundary' MIM as well as form connections between the cristae junction and the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pfanner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">van der Laan et al., 2016</a>). MICOS is composed of several subunits located on the MIM and mitochondrial intermembrane space, including MIC25, MIC60, MIC10, MIC26, MIC27, MIC19, and this core complex has been shown to interact with SAM50, MTX1, and MTX2 on the MOM, presumably helping to position cristae structures in proximity to the MOM. Our recent proteomic analysis of the MICOS complex identified a previously unstudied single-pass transmembrane protein \u2013 C19ORF70/QIL1 \u2013 as a component of MICOS localized in the MIM (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guarani et al., 2015</a>). Depletion of QIL1 by RNAi in tissue culture cell lines resulted in: (1) loss of cristae junction structures accompanied by the formation of MIMs with characteristic 'swirl' structures, (2) MICOS complex disassembly, (3) loss of MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27 protein levels, (4) failure to assemble into a MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex, and (5) decreased mitochondrial respiration (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guarani et al., 2015</a>). RNAi of the <i>Drosophila</i> QIL1 ortholog in muscle and nervous tissue lead to a similar mitochondrial phenotype in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Guarani et al., 2015</a>). Thus, QIL1 is required for assembly and maintenance of the MICOS complex and mitochondrial architecture. This mechanism of MICOS assembly and the role of QIL1 have recently been verified (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zerbes et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anand et al., 2016</a>)."

Molecular and cell biological studies revealed dramatic defects in mitochondrial organization in fibroblasts and muscle tissue derived from these patients that are associated with disassembly of the MICOS complex. MICOS assembly and mitochondrial architecture phenotypes in patient fibroblasts could be fully rescued by re-introduction of <i>QIL1</i>, but not other MICOS subunits, consistent with <i>QIL1</i> mutation underlying the phenotypes observed. These data reveal a critical role for the MICOS core complex in mitochondrial health and disease."

Both patients (patient 1, female and patient 2, male) were born after an uneventful pregnancy with normal birth parameters, although patient 1 had a smaller than the\u00a0average head circumference (10th percentile). At 16\u2009hr of life, patient 1 was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, displaying an array of abnormalities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), including hypothermia, lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and signs of liver failure. Plasma amino acids showed elevation of tyrosine and methionine concentration and urine organic acids revealed the presence of 3-methylglutaconic acid associated with lactic acid and Krebs cycle intermediates (malate and fumarate). After 48\u2009hr of symptomatic treatment, including a protein and lipid-free infusion of glucose (13.5\u2009g/kg/day) with electrolytes, the child fully recovered both clinically and biologically. During the next 6 months, neurodevelopment and growth were normal except for the\u00a0incidence of acquired microcephaly from the age of 4 months (-2 SD at 4 months of age). At the age of 6 months, in the course of a benign febrile upper respiratory infection, she exhibited neurological deterioration with hypotonia, hyperlactacidemia with high lactate to pyruvate ratio, and evidence of mild liver disease without overt liver failure (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Liver ultrasound disclosed hyperechogenicity of the liver with two hypoechogenic nodules in the VI and VII segments. Heart ultrasound disclosed mild hypertrophy with normal heart function and brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy with optic atrophy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>) and a moderate lactate peak on brain MR spectroscopy (not shown). Plasma amino acids showed elevation of methionine consistent with liver disease and urine organic acids showed persistent urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). After three days of symptomatic treatment, there was a partial improvement of neurological functions, but persistence of poor eye contact and truncal hypotonia, disappearance of biological abnormalities except for mild hyperlactacidemia (2.5 to 3.5\u2009mM). Bilateral and severe sensorineural deafness was confirmed by auditory evoked potentials. Severe bilateral neurovisual impairment was confirmed by evoked visual potentials, which showed barely detectable responses. Eye fundoscopy and elecroretinogram was normal. The child died before the age of 3 after slow progression of her neurological disease."

Oxygen consumption resumed upon subsequent addition of 10\u2009mM succinate (Succ) to the digitonin-permeabilized fibroblast. This oxidation decreased in the presence of oligomycin (oligo) (a mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor) while adding an uncoupling agent (<i>m</i>-ClCCP) allowed a maximal rate of oxidation and to calculate a respiratory chain control (RCR) value (rate in the presence of uncoupler <i>versus</i> rate in the presence of the ATPase inhibitor). Malonate (Malo) (a specific succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) addition essentially abolished oxygen uptake linked to succinate oxidation. Adding glycerol-3 phosphate (G3P) allowed the oxygen uptake to resume, this latter being fully inhibited by the addition of cyanide (KCN). The values\u00a0along the traces are nmol/min/mg protein. (<b>H</b>) Control (black bars) or patient (blue or red bars) fibroblasts were cultured in the presence and absence of glucose for 7 days and cell number determined after 4 and 7 days (n\u00a0=\u00a03)."

QIL1 deficiency in patient fibroblasts did not affect mitochondrial DNA abundance, but resulted in severely disorganized mitochondrial cristae. In principle, the deletion of exon 2, which encoded the single-pass transmembrane domain apparently involved in QIL1 tethering to the MIM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), would be expected to greatly reduce the efficiency of MICOS assembly (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guarani et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zerbes et al., 2016</a>). Given the presence of a premature stop codon in the mRNA for the QIL1 mutant, it is likely that the mRNA is degraded through non-sense mediated decay. We also detected generalized mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies in skeletal muscle from patient 1 consistent with a reduced mitochondrial respiration previously reported upon QIL1 RNAi mediated knockdown in human cell lines (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guarani et al., 2015</a>). However, we detected only a mild complex IV (cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase) deficiency in skin fibroblasts grown in culture. Interestingly, contrary to what was observed in RNAi-induced QIL1 depletion in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guarani et al., 2015</a>), there was no effect of QIL1 deficiency on fibroblasts\u2019 basal respiration in agreement with the limited defect affecting complex IV and the normal respiratory chain enzyme activities in these cells. Differences in mitochondrial activities observed between muscle biopsies and skin fibroblasts from patients are commonly observed in mitochondrial disorders (<a href=\"#bib17\">Haas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Thorburn and Smeitink, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van den Heuvel et al., 2004</a>). It has been reported that nearly 50% of the children with a respiratory chain defect in muscle display normal enzyme activities in cultured skin fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib39\">Thorburn, 2000</a>) and respiratory chain defects are often not expressed in fibroblasts even in some well-recognized oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies (<a href=\"#bib32\">Robinson et al., 1990</a>)."

Interestingly, an increase in cristae density has been reported upon general nutrient or glucose deprivation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gomes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rossignol et al., 2004</a>), indicating an important link between mitochondrial architecture and nutrient utilization. It has been proposed that mitochondrial cristae architecture may control nutrient utilization via different mechanisms, including electron transport chain function, nutrient import and access (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stanley et al., 2014</a>). Thus, differences between mitochondrial respiration defects observed in muscle and fibroblasts may not only reflect the pleiotropic nature of phenotypes of mitochondrial diseases, often eliciting highly tissue-specific effects (<a href=\"#bib40\">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</a>), but also be related to cell-specific metabolic requirements and different mitochondrial pathways. Alternatively, skin fibroblasts may have possibly developed adaptive mechanisms over time to permit normal basal respiration under culture conditions. Nevertheless, <i>QIL1</i> mutation in patient fibroblasts had a\u00a0major impact on the abundance of other MICOS subunits, on MICOS assembly, and on the mitochondrial ultrastructure. A proposed model is shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>, wherein loss of QIL1 leads to loss of cristae structure and reduced levels of MIC60, MIC19, MIC25, MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27, with MIC10, MIC26 and MIC27 being affected to the largest extent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-B</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1N</a>). Residual MIC60 and MIC19 could be found in an ~500\u2009kDa complex in blue-native gels using quantitative proteomics (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,J</a>), suggesting that this sub-complex of MICOS does not require QIL1 for assembly (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guarani et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, overexpression of MIC10 and MIC27 in QIL1-defective fibroblasts resulted in a fraction of mitochondria containing cristae like structures, with very low levels of MICOS complex assembly observed by blue-native gels. The ability of MIC10 and MIC27 overexpression to promote cristae formation with low efficiency may relate to the ability of MIC10 to form large oligomers and promote membrane curvature independently of other MICOS subunits (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barbot et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bohnert et al., 2015</a>) and MIC27 to bind cardiolipin which also promotes curvature (<a href=\"#bib43\">Weber et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, we observed that MIC27 expression increased MIC10 levels, and it is possible that the ability of MIC27 to support complex formation with low efficiency may reflect stabilization of MIC10 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1L,N</a>). These findings are in line with previous observations by Koob et al who reported that MIC27 expression positively correlated with the levels of MIC10, and proposed that MIC26 and MIC27 modulate MIC10 levels (<a href=\"#bib21\">Koob et al., 2015</a>). Zerbes at al also reported that MIC27 promotes the stability of the MIC10 oligomers (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zerbes et al., 2016</a>). Further studies are needed to address the underlying mechanism. Additionally, we note that fibroblasts from patients have highly enlarged mitochondrial structures, suggesting loss of appropriate mitochondrial fission-fusion cycles, and the absence of mitophagic destruction of damaged mitochondria. Similar defects in fusion-fission cycles and development of swollen mitochondria has been observed in cells lacking the MICOS subunit MIC60, suggesting that the observed phenotype is a general property of disruption of cristae structures (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2016</a>)."

CHCHD10 haploinsufficiency, found in a family with neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial respiratory chain defects also demonstrates impaired MICOS complex stability, cristae formation and mitochondrial genome organization (<a href=\"#bib13\">Genin et al., 2015</a>). Noticeably, alterations of different MICOS subunit protein levels and amino acid substitutions have been associated with several conditions, such as diabetic cardiomyopathy, neurodegeneration and cancer in cellular and animal model systems (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zerbes et al., 2012</a>). Taken together, our results suggest that QIL1 and other MICOS subunits represent potential candidates for mutations in patients with unexplained early onset neurological deterioration with optic and cerebellar atrophy progressing over time combined with liver disease and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria."

Patients\u2019 fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies of patients and signed informed consent for skin biopsy, fibroblasts storage, enzymatic and molecular analyses was obtained from the parents. Cells were authenticated through an in-house database system from the Biochemistry Department of Bic\u00eatre Hospital (Le Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre, France) where the cells were also stored in liquid nitrogen. Fibroblasts tested negative for mycoplasma. Control fibroblasts were kindly provided by Robin Reed\u2019s laboratory (Harvard Medical School) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yamazaki et al., 2012</a>) or obtained from Invitrogen (human dermal fibroblasts; neonatal, Invitrogen [C0045C]). Cells were cultivated in the presence and absence of glucose as reported elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schiff et al., 2011</a>). On day zero when the experiment was initiated, cells were at 50% confluence. After 4 or 7 days in culture in the presence or absence of glucose, cell density (cell number <i>per</i> cm<sup>2</sup>) was estimated from representative photographs taken using phase-contrast an LSM 5 Exciter optic microscope (Zeiss, Marly le Roi, France) (x40) by counting non-confluent adherent cells in three identical areas of T25 flasks for each condition."

Neonatal control skin fibroblasts or patient 2 skin fibroblasts were grown in light (K0) or heavy media (K8) and an equal number of cells mixed, prior to purification of mitochondria. Mitochondria were lysed with 1% Digitonin and protein complexes fractionated by blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). Gel bands were excised and proteins subjected to reduction, alkylation and trypsinization. Tryptic peptides were analyzed using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled with a Famos Autosampler (LC Packings) and an Accela600 liquid chromatography (LC) pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 100\u2009\u03bcm inner diameter microcapillary column packed with ~0.25 cm of Magic C4 resin (5\u2009\u03bcm, 100\u2009\u00c5, Michrom Bioresources,\u00a0Auburn,\u00a0CA) followed by ~18 cm of Accucore C18 resin (2.6\u2009\u03bcm, 150\u2009\u00c5, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each analysis, we loaded ~1\u2009\u03bcg onto the column. Peptides were separated using a 90 gradient of 5 to 28% acetonitrile in 0.125% formic acid with a flow rate of ~300 nL/min. The scan sequence began with an Orbitrap MS1 spectrum with the following parameters: resolution 70,000, scan range 300\u22121500 Th, automatic gain control (AGC) target 1 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>, maximum injection time 250 ms, and centroid spectrum data type. We selected the top twenty precursors for MS2 analysis which consisted of HCD high-energy collision dissociation with the following parameters: resolution 17,500, AGC 1 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>, maximum injection time 60 ms, isolation window 2 Th, normalized collision energy (NCE) 25, and centroid spectrum data type. The underfill ratio was set at 9%, which corresponds to a 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> intensity threshold. In addition, unassigned and singly charged species were excluded from MS2 analysis and dynamic exclusion was set to automatic."

DNA sequences were aligned to the reference genome Hg19 using BWA v0.6.1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>).

The relevance of the present submission is that they have now found that null mutations in this gene, identified by exome sequencing, result in a recessive mitochondrial disorder in humans, involving early-onset fatal encephalomyopathy and liver disease. The analysis of patients' fibroblasts have allowed to confirm the central role on QIL1 in MICOS assembly and function."

It doesn't look like the numbers are that different from control (ie the cells appear to have proliferated), and I guess they interpret the brightness as a stress response, which is not unreasonable, but I must say I find it a bit surprising based on the intact respiratory chain. Cell counts, some molecular markers would be useful. In my experience some cells with combined respiratory chain defects more severe than those reported here are able to grow on galactose, and such a comparison might provide some useful insight."

One suggestion was to overexpress QIL1 and examine the effect on MICOS formation. In our previous paper in <i>eLife</i> identifying QIL1, we performed this experiment. Briefly, we found that in cells containing a lentiviral vector ectopically expressing QIL1-HA under CMV control, we were unable to \u201coverexpress\u201d the protein, and in the context of QIL1-HA expression, there was a commensurate reduction in the abundance of the endogenous protein, suggesting a homeostatic mechanism controlling total QIL1 abundance. In the present study, we observed a similar reduction of endogenous QIL1 levels upon expression of the C-terminally tagged version (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5I</a>). Of note, ectopic QIL1 expression did not seem to affect MICOS levels or assembly as evidenced by MIC10 immunoblotting of Blue-native gels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) and SDS-PAGE analysis of MIC60 and MIC10 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5I</a>)."

We found that neither MIC60 nor MIC19 rescued MICOS assembly by blue-native electrophoresis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1L-N</a>). In the case of MIC27 and MIC10 overexpression, we detected anti-MIC10 reactivity very weakly at ~700 kDa in the native gel analysis, but we also observed additional forms at ~800 kDa and at much lower mass (~100 kDa) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1L</a>). Similarly, by EM, expression of MIC60 or MIC19 did not promote cristae structures. Interestingly, we found that a small fraction (~30%) of mitochondria in cells expressing MIC27 and MIC10 display some level of cristae structures (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A-K</a>). This was a surprising result but was consistent with the detection of MIC10 positive structures by native PAGE in cells over-expressing MIC27 or MIC10. As noted in the previous version, loss of QIL1 leads to a virtually complete loss of MIC10 protein in mitochondrial extracts (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1N</a>). Interestingly, overexpression of MIC27 led to the accumulation of endogenous MIC10 in QIL1 null cells (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1L-N</a>). This suggests that MIC27 may stabilize endogenous MIC10, which may facilitate partial assembly of a MICOS-like complex capable of forming cristae-like structures by electron microscopy in the absence of QIL1. These findings are in line with previous observations by Koob et al. (Koob et al., 2015) who reported that MIC27 expression positively correlated with the levels of MIC10 and suggested that MIC26 and MIC27 modulate MIC10 levels. Zerbes at al. also reported that MIC27 promotes the stability of the MIC10 oligomers (Zerbes et al., 2016). Moreover, Barbot et al. and Bohnert et al. (Barbot et al., 2015; Bohnert et al., 2015) have shown that MIC10 forms large oligomers and induces membrane curvature independently of other MICOS subunits, which could contribute to the partial normalization of cristae structures observed in patients\u2019 fibroblasts expressing ectopic MIC27 and MIC10. We now comment on this in the Discussion."

This is however a feature commonly observed in mitochondrial disorders. Even though skin biopsies are more commonly performed than muscle biopsies due to the higher invasiveness associated with muscle biopsies, as much as 50% of the children with a respiratory chain defect in muscle display normal enzyme activities in cultured skin fibroblasts (Thorburn, 2000). High respiratory activities can be measured in fibroblasts even in cases of genetically proven mitochondrial diseases (Thorburn and Smeitink, 2001) and overall, enzyme defects observed in muscle are typically more pronounced than in fibroblasts (van den Heuvel et al., 2004). Indeed, respiratory chain defects are not expressed in fibroblasts even in some well-recognized oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies (Robinson et al., 1990). Thus, fibroblasts are considered less reliable than muscle biopsies for the diagnosis of respiratory chain diseases and an absence of defects in fibroblast biochemical analysis is not sufficient to exclude a disorder of mitochondrial metabolism (Haas et al., 2008). The partial defect noticed in these fibroblasts was the incentive to carry out the experiment in the presence or absence of glucose, as respiratory chain defective fibroblasts often rely on glucose-dependent activity to proliferate and survive (Robinson et al., 1992). Indeed, patients\u2019 fibroblasts exhibited high sensitivity to glucose deprivation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), suggesting an inability to utilize the alternative mitochondrial energetic route to cope with glucose deprivation.

The distribution of these values being in addition nonstandard (possibly distorted by the limited exercise done by part of the hospitalized patients), it would be rather unsafe to use standard deviations (Chretien et al., 1998). This is why in major mitochondrial diagnostic centers in France (where the two QIL1 defective patients reported herein were hospitalized) data are compared to ranges of control activities. Varying values for absolute activities are indeed observed in most if not all types of human tissues (liver, lymphocytes, including cultured skin fibroblasts). Indeed, we have previously reported that the scatter of control absolute respiratory activity values and their overlap with those of patients limits the diagnosis of respiratory chain deficiencies (Rustin et al., 1991). However, respiratory enzyme activities are maintained at a constant ratio in every tissue analyzed (Rustin et al., 1991), which may reflect the need for the maintenance of the appropriate stoichiometry between oxidative phosphorylation complexes for the optimum function of the electron transfer process. These observations prompted us to present enzyme activities as ratios rather than absolute values. Of note, obtaining control muscle tissues covering a given range of ages and appropriate healthy tissues is often a challenge (Thorburn and Smeitink, 2001). Thus, data presented in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1B and 1C</a> are given either as ranges (for absolute enzyme activities) or as means +/- standard deviations (for ratios of enzyme activities)."

The data indicated that patient fibroblasts are sensitive to glucose depletion, and that, even if partial, the unbalanced activity of enzymes evidenced in these fibroblasts is deleterious. Moreover, QIL1 deficiency and the resulting abnormal cristae architecture may contribute to the cells\u2019 inability to grow without glucose in different ways. For example, an increase in cristae density has been reported upon general nutrient or glucose deprivation (Gomes et al., 2011; Rossignol et al., 2004) indicating an important link between mitochondrial architecture and nutrient utilization. It has been proposed that mitochondrial cristae architecture may control nutrient utilization via different mechanisms including electron transport chain function, but also nutrient import and access (Stanley et al., 2014). Thus, additional factors may contribute to the severity of the observed phenotype."

To address this question, we cultured control and patient fibroblasts in the presence and absence of glucose and measured cell numbers at 4 and 7 days. On day zero when the experiment was initiated, cells were at 50% confluence. Importantly, the cells employed are primary fibroblasts and their proliferation rates are quite slow compared with other commonly used cell types. As can be seen in the presence of glucose in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, cells double in about 3 days, a feature that is important for interpreting the data but may not have been obvious in the revised version of the paper. The primary conclusion that we make is after 7 days in the absence of glucose, the control cells continue to proliferate while the patient cells do not. This demonstrates what we think is a dramatic sensitivity to the absence of glucose and think this conclusion is clear. We interpret the reviewer\u2019s comments in part to be asking why there isn\u2019t an effect already at day 4. We believe this reflects two major factors. First, the slow cell cycle rates for these cells coupled with the time required to move from cell cycle arrest through apoptosis likely affect the total number of cells remaining at this early time point, making it difficult to observe changes. Second, previous work using patient cells with mutations in mitochondrial systems vary in the point in time that they begin to be sensitive to glucose deprivation (Robinson et al., 1992). This likely reflects the severity of the phenotype as well as complex circuits and possibly reprogramming of metabolic pathways or utilization of alternative energy sources (Stanley et al., 2014), the elucidation of which we feel is beyond the scope of this work. We also note that because these experiments are using primary cells from individuals, there are sometimes differences in growth rates among the individual patients even in the presence of glucose. Overall, the slight variation in cell numbers between the different cell lines likely represents variation at the individual level."
