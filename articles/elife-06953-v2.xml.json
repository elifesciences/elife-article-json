It is presumed that these precursors integrate cortical networks where they act as sensors of neuronal activity. We show that NG2 cells of the developing somatosensory cortex form a transient and structured synaptic network with interneurons that follows its own rules of connectivity. Fast-spiking interneurons, highly connected to NG2 cells, target proximal subcellular domains containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with \u03b32 subunits. Conversely, non-fast-spiking interneurons, poorly connected with these progenitors, target distal sites lacking this subunit. In the network, interneuron-NG2 cell connectivity maps exhibit a local spatial arrangement reflecting innervation only by the nearest interneurons. This microcircuit architecture shows a connectivity peak at PN10, coinciding with a switch to massive oligodendrocyte differentiation. Hence, GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells is temporally and spatially regulated from the subcellular to the network level in coordination with the onset of oligodendrogenesis."

It is presumed that these precursors integrate cortical networks where they act as sensors of neuronal activity. We show that NG2 cells of the developing somatosensory cortex form a transient and structured synaptic network with interneurons that follows its own rules of connectivity. Fast-spiking interneurons, highly connected to NG2 cells, target proximal subcellular domains containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with \u03b32 subunits. Conversely, non-fast-spiking interneurons, poorly connected with these progenitors, target distal sites lacking this subunit. In the network, interneuron-NG2 cell connectivity maps exhibit a local spatial arrangement reflecting innervation only by the nearest interneurons. This microcircuit architecture shows a connectivity peak at PN10, coinciding with a switch to massive oligodendrocyte differentiation. Hence, GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells is temporally and spatially regulated from the subcellular to the network level in coordination with the onset of oligodendrogenesis."

However, these two types of interneuron establish synapses on different parts of the NG2 cell, and these synapses involve different receptor proteins."

This period of peak activity is accompanied by a sudden increase in the maturation of NG2 cells into oligodendrocytes. Further experiments are needed to test the possibility that activity in the interneuron-NG2 cell network acts as the trigger for the NG2 cells to turn into oligodendrocytes, which then supply myelin for the developing brain."

Since then, the existence of functional synapses between neurons and NG2 cells is recognized as a major physiological feature of these cells throughout the brain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Maldonado and Angulo, 2014</a>). In the somatosensory cortex, NG2 cells receive a major synaptic input from local GABAergic interneurons that disappears after the second postnatal (PN) week (<a href=\"#bib39\">V\u00e9lez-Fort et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Balia et al., 2015</a>). Cortical NG2 cells are, therefore, believed to be transiently embedded in GABAergic microcircuits at a period known to undergo oligodendrocyte differentiation in the neocortex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baracskay et al., 2002</a>). However, while the connectivity patterns between neocortical interneurons and their neuronal partners begin to be elucidated (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fino and Yuste, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>), the rules governing the GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells in the network are elusive."

Their diversity has been a matter of intense investigation for several decades and is known to impact synaptic signaling and computational capacities of neuronal networks (<a href=\"#bib19\">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fishell and Rudy, 2011</a>). Different types of interneurons target specific subcellular compartments of their postsynaptic neuron. Such compartmentalization creates a specific distribution of channels, receptors, and signaling mechanisms and allows for an effective regulation of synaptic integration, plasticity, and spiking (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huang et al., 2007</a>). For instance, it has been observed that the localization of different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) in neocortical pyramidal neurons is input-specific since presynaptic parvalbumin (PV)-positive, fast-spiking cells innervate proximal postsynaptic sites with GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs-containing \u03b11 subunits, whereas bitufted interneurons contact postsynaptic sites with GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs-containing \u03b15 subunits (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ali and Thomson, 2008</a>). At a higher level, the connectivity patterns of neocortical interneurons in the network also appear to be highly specific (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>). PV-positive interneurons strongly inhibit one another but provide little inhibition to other subtypes of interneurons, whereas somatostatin-positive interneurons strongly inhibit all other interneurons but are poorly interconnected with each other (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>). Despite the existence of specific connectivity patterns among interneurons, this heterogeneous cell population carves out unspecific and dense connections with pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fino and Yuste, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Packer et al., 2014</a>). Hence, the connectivity of interneurons cannot be generalized and categorized in a simple way."

By combining immunohistochemistry, paired recordings, and holographic photolysis for circuit mapping, our results reveal that interneuron-NG2 cell connections in the developing neocortex form a transient and organized local network that is functional only during the most critical days of cortical oligodendrogenesis. A local microcircuit architecture with interneuron-NG2 cell intersomatic distances never exceeding 70 \u00b5m is accompanied with a specific subcellular arrangement of inputs from fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) and from non-fast-spiking interneurons (NFSIs). These two classes of interneurons target different segregated postsynaptic domains containing distinct GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. In conclusion, these progenitors form their own structured network with interneurons whose properties are temporally and spatially regulated in concordance with the onset of oligodendrocyte differentiation process."

Firing frequency was calculated for the entire pulse as the number of spikes divided by the pulse duration (F<sub>total</sub>). Three instantaneous discharge frequencies were also calculated: (1) between the first pair of spikes (F<sub>initial</sub>); (2) at 200 ms from the beginning of the pulse (F<sub>200</sub>); and (3) at the end of the pulse (F<sub>final</sub>). These values were used to quantify both early and late accommodations in accordance with the following formulas: (F<sub>initial</sub> \u2212 F<sub>200</sub>/F<sub>initial</sub>) and (F<sub>200</sub> \u2212 F<sub>final</sub>/F<sub>initial</sub>), respectively. We also dissected the spike morphology from action potentials elicited by 80-ms suprathreshold pulses from \u221270 mV (150\u2013200 pA). From these recordings, the spike threshold corresponded to the voltage at which the derivative of the AP (dV/dt) experienced a twofold increase. The amplitudes, the first and the second AP (A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>), were calculated from the threshold to peak. Their duration (D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>) corresponded to the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) from a Gaussian fit of the depolarized face of the AP immediately after the threshold. Both amplitude reduction and duration increase were calculated by the formulas A<sub>1</sub> \u2212 A<sub>2</sub>/A<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> \u2212 D<sub>1</sub>/D<sub>1</sub>, respectively. The amplitude of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) was calculated as the difference between the threshold and the peak of the fast hyperpolarization. We also estimated the AHP width as the FWHM and the latency of AP peak to AHP trough. We extracted the positive and negative peaks from the derivative of the AP waveform to quantify the maximal speed excursion of the membrane voltage during both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing faces of the AP. Finally, the input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was measured in current clamp by applying hyperpolarizing pulses from \u221260 mV (\u2212200 pA). The three major parameters to differentiate FSI from NFSI appeared in bold. Note that seven other parameters also easily differentiate these interneurons. NS: no significant difference."

However, the proportion of connected FSIs was high compared to the FSI abundance in tested pairs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) or within the population of tested FSIs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Conversely, the proportion of connected NFSIs was low compared to the NFSI abundance in tested pairs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) or within the population of tested NFSIs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). These data suggest that connection probabilities of FSIs and NFSIs are different. To determine whether differences in the connection probabilities for FSIs (p = 0.43) and NFSIs (p = 0.21) did not arise by chance, we modeled each of the two data sets as observations from two binomial distributions. The estimated connection probabilities at 90% confidence intervals for FSIs and NFSIs were 0.30\u20130.57 and 0.15\u20130.27, respectively (<a href=\"#bib22\">Brown et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). If the two populations have the same connection probabilities, we expect non-overlapping intervals in at most 1% of the cases (0.1 \u00d7 0.1). No overlap was observed between these two intervals, indicating that FSIs and NFSIs have different connection probabilities (p &lt; 0.01). We obtained a similar result using a chi-square test (Pearson's chi-square of 6.93; p &lt; 0.01). In another hand, it is noteworthy that no significant differences of main discriminative electrophysiological parameters were found between tested and connected NFSIs, indicating that NFSIs innervating NG2 cells constitute a heterogeneous population of interneurons as observed in the tested population (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). Altogether, these results indicate that NFSIs are by far more abundant and diverse but poorly connected to NG2 cells, whereas FSIs are less abundant but highly connected to NG2 cells in the developing GABAergic network."

We, thus, tested how this transient connectivity occurs for FSI and NFSI separately. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> illustrates the connection probability of these interneurons at three different postnatal stages.

Paired-pulse ratios, PSC1 and PSC2 amplitudes with or without failures, coefficients of variation, and probabilities of response were not significantly different between FSI-NG2 cell and NFSI-NG2 cell connections, suggesting that presynaptic mechanisms of GABA release did not participate in the selectivity for presynaptic inputs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>). However, we observed a significant difference in current kinetics with rise and decay times faster for unitary FSI-NG2 cell connections (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). These kinetic differences could result from two main causes: (1) FSI-NG2 cell and NFSI-NG2 cell synapses are distributed at different subcellular locations with FSI-NG2 cell conductances at proximal contact sites being properly clamped during whole-cell recordings, and NFSI-NG2 cell conductances at more distal contacts being electrotonically filtered; (2) the subunit composition of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is different according to the presynaptic identity of the interneuron (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pearce, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ali and Thomson, 2008</a>).

We considered that VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>\u2212</sup> puncta corresponded to FSI and NFSI contacts, respectively. VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> puncta were more abundant than VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>\u2212</sup> on the soma, whereas their proportion was relatively similar in NG2 cell branches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a>). Furthermore, the distribution of puncta was significantly closer to the soma for VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> than for VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>\u2212</sup> puncta (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) with a mean distance in branches of 12.8 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b5m and 22.5 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5m, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001 excluding puncta on the soma). To rule out that the specific segregation of inputs was caused by their uneven distribution around recorded NG2 cells rather than a specific subcellular targeting, we analyzed the distribution of puncta surrounding these cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> puncta were homogeneously distributed in the space at the vicinity of analyzed NG2 cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C</a>). These results indicate that FSIs contact preferentially NG2 cell somata and proximal branches, whereas NFSIs mainly contact distal branches. This is consistent with the faster current kinetics observed for unitary FSI-NG2 cell connections and demonstrates a differential distribution of presynaptic inputs on NG2 cells, according to the interneuron identity."

Differences on postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit composition in NG2 cells may also account for input specificity.

However, current amplitudes of unitary interneuron-NG2 cell connections are very small compared to extracellularly evoked currents, suggesting that a single NG2 cell is densely connected by many interneurons in the network, but that a single interneuron contacts a glial progenitor through a restricted number of release sites. To determine whether interneuron-NG2 cell connections consisted of single- or multiple-release sites, we examined the response probabilities by using paired-pulse stimulations of presynaptic neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Angulo et al., 1999</a>). In 8 out of 18 connections, quantal analysis revealed no statistical differences between cumulative distributions of PSC1 and PSC2 amplitudes, excluding failures, although the response probabilities were significantly higher for PSC1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,E,F</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This implies that PSCs result from the release of only one quantum of transmitters, and therefore, a single vesicle was released per connection (<a href=\"#bib36\">Stevens and Wang, 1995</a>). The mean amplitude of PSCs without failures corresponded to a mean quantal size of \u22127.71 \u00b1 0.71 pA in our recording conditions. These interneurons, thus, innervate NG2 cells probably through one release site, independent of the presynaptic interneuron identity and the postnatal day (5 FSIs and 3 NFSIs displayed single vesicular release at postnatal days from PN8 to PN13)."

This cage compound is one of the most efficient in terms of release of glutamate by light and of stability at physiological pH and temperature (<a href=\"#bib26\">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</a>).

This time window corresponds to the latency after photostimulation required to trigger an action potential in interneurons (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>). Indeed, action potential generation with light through the activation of glutamate receptors cannot be precisely controlled as with patch-clamp recordings.

Moreover, the connection probability highly decreased after intersomatic distances of 50 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>).

The local architecture of interneuron-NG2 cell connections, thus, did not result from the impossibility to detect connections over 70 \u00b5m with holographic photolysis.

Indeed, the production of premyelinating oligodendrocyte in the cerebral cortex starts during the first postnatal week and reaches a peak at PN14 when compared to PN21 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Trapp et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Baracskay et al., 2002</a>). We investigated, therefore, whether GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells during this period occurs in conjunction with the active phase of differentiation of these progenitors. For these, we analyzed the connection probability of paired recordings on a daily basis, from PN8 to PN13, and compared it with the NG2 cell differentiation process in layer V. We observed that the connection probability reached a peak at PN10, when we found 44% of connected pairs, and then decreased (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), confirming the transient GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">V\u00e9lez-Fort et al., 2010</a>).

The density of CC1<sup>+</sup>/Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells was low at PN9 and PN10 and significantly increased from PN11 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013F</a>). Therefore, the peak of synaptic connectivity of cortical NG2 cells at PN10 coincides with a switch to a massive NG2 cell differentiation occurring between PN10 and PN11 in cortical layer V (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). To further analyze whether the transient GABAergic connectivity of NG2 cells and the switch to oligodendrocyte differentiation were related processes, we tested whether the Na<sup>+</sup> current density of NG2 cells correlates with the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events at different postnatal days. Indeed, it has been shown that both the amplitude of Na<sup>+</sup> currents and the synaptic current frequency decrease when these progenitors undergo differentiation (<a href=\"#bib12\">De Biase et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kukley et al., 2010</a>). As expected from paired recordings and previous studies (<a href=\"#bib39\">V\u00e9lez-Fort et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Balia et al., 2015</a>), the frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity increases from PN8 to PN10 and then decreases at PN13 (0.12 \u00b1 0.02 Hz, 0.24 \u00b1 0.05 Hz, 0.12 \u00b1 0.02 Hz, respectively; p &lt; 0.05 for PN10). However, no statistical differences were observed either on the averaged amplitudes of spontaneous synaptic currents or Na<sup>+</sup> current densities between PN8, PN10, and PN13 (amplitude of synaptic currents: \u221210.45 \u00b1 1.04 pA, \u221212.75 \u00b1 1.27 pA, \u221212.07 \u00b1 0.90 pA, respectively; Na<sup>+</sup> current densities: 22.59 \u00b1 2.99 pA/pF, 23.46 \u00b1 3.56 pA/pF, 26.10 \u00b1 3.72 pA/pF, respectively; p &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, while no correlation was observed between the Na<sup>+</sup> current density and the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events at PN8 and PN13 when connectivity is low, a positive correlation was observed at PN10 when connectivity is high and the switch to differentiation starts (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data suggest that interneurons build up a large number of functional synapses in more immature NG2 cells at the onset of massive oligodendrocyte differentiation (PN10) and then, GABAergic synapses disassemble. The transient NG2 cell-synaptic connectivity is thus not only spatially, but also temporally regulated in coordination with the active differentiation phase of these progenitors in the second PN week."

We demonstrate that NG2 cells form a transient and highly organized network with interneurons that is characterized by a high-connection probability at PN10, a specific distribution of synaptic inputs on cell bodies and branches, a restricted number of contacts per interneuron, and very local connectivity maps. GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells, thus, appears as a finely regulated process that follows its own logic, which cannot be inferred from previous studies on NG2 cells and on classical neuronal synapses."

We demonstrate that input-specific projections also exist for interneuron-NG2 cell connections. NG2 cells compartmentalize FSI- and NFSI-input regions as revealed by distinct anatomical locations of PV<sup>+</sup> and PV<sup>\u2212</sup> contacts and by a different distribution of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with or without \u03b3<sub>2</sub> subunits at postsynaptic sites. FSIs and NFSIs impinging on these glial progenitors, thus, probably encode distinct information that regulates different cellular NG2 cell processes. Located at proximal sites and somata, FSI synapses could regulate NG2 cell differentiation by controlling gene expression, whereas distal NFSI synapses could affect motility or migration. Indeed, it has been suggested that GABA probably promotes NG2 cell migration through the activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tong et al., 2009</a>)."

Compared to adult animals, immature FSIs possess different electrophysiological properties, such as high-input resistance, relatively low-membrane time constants, and a certain degree of spike-frequency adaptation, and are thus unlikely to perform the same function that in mature circuits (<a href=\"#bib27\">Okaty et al., 2009</a>). In fact, FSIs probably do not contribute to coordinating cortical neuronal activity in the perinatal period since FSI-pyramidal cell connections are detected only from PN5 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011</a>). FSIs start to influence cortical activity only during the second postnatal week (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011</a>), and as shown here, it is also at this period that they constitute a significant, transient presynaptic input to NG2 cells. Synaptic communication between FSIs and NG2 cells could, therefore, play a role in the maturation of FSIs in the developing neuronal network."

Since myelination is an activity-dependent process (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zalc and Fields, 2000</a>), an interesting possibility would be that the restricted point-to-point GABA release at unitary interneuron-NG2 cell connections encodes a signal that triggers NG2 cell differentiation and myelination of the presynaptic interneuronal axon, preferentially that of FSIs. Myelination of neocortical FSIs is likely to occur since myelin is important for the organization of Kv1 channels (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rasband et al., 1998</a>), and these channels have been proposed to mediate the variability in FSI-firing patterns (<a href=\"#bib16\">Golomb et al., 2007</a>). In addition, axonal signals are essential to regulate oligodendrocyte production and survival (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barres et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Trapp et al., 1997</a>), and interneuronal axons transiently contact NG2 cells during active-cortical oligodendrogenesis."

On the contrary, we show that one-photon holographic photolysis is a suitable alternative tool to elicit action potentials in neurons at single-cell resolution and find unitary connections. Using this technique, we demonstrate that interneuron-NG2 cell connections display a very local arrangement in the network. This difference cannot be explained exclusively by the small volume occupied by NG2 cells. Indeed, axons of interneurons that ramify extensively and travel long did not innervate NG2 cells over 70 \u00b5m. In fact, the connectivity of NG2 cells already decreases at interneuron-NG2 cell intersomatic distances of 50 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). It has been reported that no specificity exists between the spatial profiles of interneuron-pyramidal cell connectivity maps, and thus, that pyramidal cells do not form specific networks in the neocortex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fino and Yuste, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Packer et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, interneuron-NG2 cell connectivity maps follow a local spatial arrangement, reflecting a focal control of NG2 cell activity by interneurons. This microarchitecture supposes a close relationship between the proximal part of interneuronal axons and NG2 cells. The existence of a local network formed by interneurons and NG2 cells, embedded within the developing neuronal network, implies the involvement of selective molecular and cellular mechanisms ensuring this local connectivity. These mechanisms remain to be elucidated."

We demonstrate that the emergence of properly organized GABAergic neuronal microcircuits is not only confined to neurons, but also includes a non-neuronal cell type. Interestingly, after the peak of synaptic connectivity at PN10, the decrease of GABAergic synaptic innervation of NG2 cells is accompanied by other relevant physiological changes in these progenitors: (1) there is a decrease in the amplitude of GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated miniature events (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balia et al., 2015</a>); (2) Kir channels start to be upregulated (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kressin et al., 1995</a>); and (3) the first wave of oligodendrocytes arising from Nkx2.1-expressing precursors of MGE and the anterior entopeduncular area is eliminated (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kessaris et al., 2006</a>). An intriguing question for future research is whether cortical NG2 cell development onto oligodendrocytes occurs under the control of interneuronal activity in the developing neuronal network. The GABAergic synaptic input probably does not control per se cortical oligodendrocyte production, which is a protracted process that occurs during several weeks, even after the loss of functional synapses. However, the coincidence between the peak of connectivity (PN10) and the switch to a massive NG2 cell differentiation from PN10 raises the possibility that the interneuron-NG2 cell network sets precisely the onset of oligodendrogenesis occurring in deep layers of the neocortex during the second postnatal week. This would explain why a transient and structured NG2 cell connectivity is necessary."

Images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ and Imaris softwares. For counting layer V Olig2<sup>+</sup>/CC1<sup>+</sup> cells, we analyzed 270 \u00d7 270 \u00b5m of 10\u201320 Z-sections (each 1 \u00b5m). For counting layer V PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons, we analyzed 225 \u00d7 225 \u00b5m of 55 Z-sections (each 0.5 \u00b5m) from PV immunostainings of barrel cortex of Venus<sup>+</sup> mice. Co-localization of biocytin-loaded NG2 cells and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV puncta as well as NG2<sup>+</sup> cells and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/\u03b32<sup>+</sup> was assessed on 125 \u00d7 125 \u00b5m 60 Z-sections (each 0.32 \u00b5m). 3D surfaces were created for all channels after applying a median filter to reduce noise. First, we quantified the number of VGAT<sup>+</sup> puncta per NG2 cell somata and branches. For this, we extracted the fluorescent profiles for VGAT puncta and biocytin-loaded NG2 cells by tracing a line crossing both the puncta and the biocytin-loaded region. We considered as a contacting puncta those showing more than 23% overlapping of fluorescent profiles. Finally, we checked whether or not those VGAT<sup>+</sup> puncta on NG2 cells colocalized with PV. Countings were performed for 4 biocytin-loaded NG2 cells and on 6\u20138 branches per NG2 cell. Similar colocalization parameters were applied for VGAT<sup>+</sup>/\u03b32<sup>+</sup> on NG2<sup>+</sup> cells (n = 8 cells from two mice). To determine the spatial distribution of all VGAT<sup>+</sup> and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> puncta around biocytin-loaded NG2 cells, we first obtained the 3D coordinates for all puncta (Imaris tools). Then, puncta densities (number of puncta per \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>) were calculated in increasing eccentric volumes from the center of the stack where the NG2 cell soma was located. Each volume corresponded to a sphere to which spherical caps were removed to remain inside the stack (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The first volume was calculated from a sphere of 5-\u00b5m radius around the center of the field. The next volume was calculated from a sphere of 10-\u00b5m radius to which we subtracted the previous smaller volume. We repeated this volume calculation until we attained the x, y axis boundaries of the field. For each calculated volume, we determined all VGAT<sup>+</sup> and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> puncta densities."

Cumulative distributions were compared using Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Multiple group comparisons were done using one-way Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by a Dunn's multiple comparison post-hoc test. Binomial distributions and confidence intervals (Wilson interval; <a href=\"#bib22\">Brown et al., 2001</a>) for connection probabilities of FSIs and NFSIs were obtained using a custom routine in Python kindly provided by Christophe Pouzat (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Therefore, we included a new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> with the connectivity probability of FSI and NFSI with respect to the age. We pooled the data obtained at PN8-9, PN10-11 and PN12-13 to increase the number of connected pairs for each of the two groups of interneurons (3 or more for FSI and 6 or more for NFSI for a total tested pairs of 45, 44 and 44 at PN8- 9, PN10-11 and P12-13, respectively). Note the peak of connectivity at PN10-11 for both FSI and NFSI in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>. The transient increase in connectivity occurs for both groups of interneurons at PN10-11 and is not differently affected by the age of the animal (see the last paragraph of the subsection headed \u201cFast-spiking interneurons are highly connected to NG2 cells\u201d). We also clarify at which ages were performed all the experiments throughout the text (particularly in the Results section). The transient connectivity does not impact electrophysiological properties such as the kinetics of postsynaptic events of FSI-NG2 cell and NFSI-NG2 cell connections (see subsection \u201cFSIs and NFSIs target specific segregated subcellular domains\u201d) and single vs. double release sites (see \u201cRestricted number of release sites per interneuron\u201d)."

                    "text": "The postsynaptic protein assemblies of NG2 cells have not been studied yet and could be substantially different from those found in neurons. For instance, the expression of gephyrin, a major marker of neuronal postsynaptic sites, has not been observed in NG2 cells (Seifi et al., 2014, Front Anat). Therefore, to answer the reviewers\u2019 comment, we used the \u03b32 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub> Rs as a postsynaptic marker since we know from our present and previous studies that this subunit is expressed at many NG2 cell GABAergic synapses (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B-C</a> and <a href=\"#bib4\">Balia et al., 2015</a>, Cerebral Cortex). First, we performed triple immunostainings against VGAT, PV (presynaptic markers) and \u03b32 (postsynaptic marker) in DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells of NG2-DsRed mice at PN10, the age previously used to analyze VGAT/PV puncta (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C-E</a>). We observed the presence of VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup>/\u03b32<sup>+</sup> puncta on DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells, but co-localization with the cell was sometimes ambiguous because the DsRed protein is not homogeneously expressed in soma and branches, resulting in cell borders difficult to define. We thus performed triple immunostainings against VGAT (the presynaptic marker), \u03b32 (the postsynaptic marker) and NG2 (a marker of NG2 cell membranes) in DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells of NG2-DsRed mice at PN10. Note that NG2 and PV cannot be combined in these experiments since both are rabbit polyclonal antibodies. This is not a real limitation since all considered PV<sup>+</sup> puncta were also VGAT<sup>+</sup> puncta (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C-E</a>). The PV/VGAT colocalization is mandatory since PV can also be expressed outside synapses. New <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> illustrates the presence of numerous VGAT<sup>+</sup>/\u03b32<sup>+</sup> synaptic puncta on NG2 <sup>+</sup> cell membranes of the soma and branches as previously observed in biocytin-loaded cells (same co-localization parameters; see Materials and methods, subsection headed \u201cImmunostainings and puncta analysis\u201d). In addition, VGAT<sup>+</sup>/\u03b32<sup>+</sup> synaptic puncta on neurons can be clearly distinguished from those present on NG2 cells at this developmental stage (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These results confirm that VGAT<sup>+</sup> puncta analyzed previously are formed on NG2 cells and not on nearby neurons, and provide in addition a protein confirmation of the presence of \u03b32 at many NG2 cell synapses (see subsection entitled \u201cFSIs and NFSIs target specific segregated subcellular domains \u201d). Finally, we also examine VGAT<sup>+</sup>/\u03b32<sup>+</sup> synaptic puncta in NG2<sup>+</sup> membranes of DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells at PN8 and PN13 and, in line with our electrophysiological data showing functional synapses at these stages, we also observed VGAT<sup>+</sup>/ \u03b32<sup>+</sup>/NG2<sup>+</sup> co- localization. However, we believe that a reliable study comparing the three ages to provide some insight into how connections are anatomically lost during oligodendrogenesis is technically challenging. The variability of the number of puncta from cell to cell, the small size of a synaptic puncta to observe any possible morphological modification, the lack of a more general postsynaptic marker and the loss of NG2 and DsRed expression when NG2 cells undergo differentiation constitute major technical difficulties to properly address this question. Although challenging, the study of anatomical changes occurring during the transient connectivity would be interesting to do in future studies. Nevertheless, we have already provided some insight into how functional connections are lost in previous reports by combining different electrophysiological, pharmacological and molecular experiments (<a href=\"#bib39\">V\u00e9lez-Fort et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Balia et al., 2015</a>)."

Upon photo-activation, interneurons will inhibit rather than excite other surrounding neurons. It is also highly unlikely that our photo-stimulation activates other structures such as dendrites of excitatory neurons which may indirectly activate an interneuron and generate di-synaptic response in NG2 cells. Indeed, when we displaced the light spot outside the targeted interneuron to the neuropil where many dendrites are axons are laying, we got ambiguous responses in only 2.8% of the cases (see subsection entitled \u201cLocal spatial arrangement of interneuron-NG2 cell connections\u201d). Finally, we also confirmed the mono-synaptic nature of the connections by patching the targeted presynaptic interneuron and performing paired recordings (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3D, E</a>)."

We thus performed the analysis proposed by the reviewers with a cut-off at 50 ms which corresponds to the delay of action potential generation of around 80% of interneurons (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>; x-axis labels were changed to better appreciate this proportion). The distributions of connected and unconnected cells were still different for NG2 cells (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D=0.2513, P&lt;0.05) . We also compared the new distributions with those reported in the previous manuscript. We found no significant differences of the mean inter-somatic distance of connected interneurons (43.9\u00b12.4 \u00b5m <i>vs</i> 42.9\u00b13.5 \u00b5m; Mann -Whitney U test, P&gt;0.05) or the distribution of inter-somatic distances of connected interneurons between the two different cut-offs (Kolmogorov- Smirnov test, D=0.060, P&gt;0.05). Similarly, no changes were observed in the case of pyramidal cells (P&gt;0.05). We concluded that the mapping of inputs is not altered when shorter latency cut-offs are used. We would prefer to keep our previous analysis because, in our opinion, a 50 ms cut-off will cause an underestimation of the number of connected interneurons."
