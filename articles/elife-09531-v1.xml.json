                    "text": "During cortical development, the identity of major classes of long-distance projection neurons is established by the expression of molecular determinants, which become gradually restricted and mutually exclusive. However, the mechanisms by which projection neurons acquire their final properties during postnatal stages are still poorly understood. In this study, we show that the number of neurons co-expressing Ctip2 and Satb2, respectively involved in the early specification of subcerebral and callosal projection neurons, progressively increases after birth in the somatosensory cortex. Ctip2/Satb2 postnatal co-localization defines two distinct neuronal subclasses projecting either to the contralateral cortex or to the brainstem suggesting that Ctip2/Satb2 co-expression may refine their properties rather than determine their identity. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches reveal that the transcriptional adaptor Lmo4 drives this maturation program through modulation of epigenetic mechanisms in a time- and area-specific manner, thereby indicating that a previously unknown genetic program postnatally promotes the acquisition of final subtype-specific features."

However, the mechanisms by which projection neurons acquire their final properties during postnatal stages are still poorly understood. In this study, we show that the number of neurons co-expressing Ctip2 and Satb2, respectively involved in the early specification of subcerebral and callosal projection neurons, progressively increases after birth in the somatosensory cortex. Ctip2/Satb2 postnatal co-localization defines two distinct neuronal subclasses projecting either to the contralateral cortex or to the brainstem suggesting that Ctip2/Satb2 co-expression may refine their properties rather than determine their identity. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches reveal that the transcriptional adaptor Lmo4 drives this maturation program through modulation of epigenetic mechanisms in a time- and area-specific manner, thereby indicating that a previously unknown genetic program postnatally promotes the acquisition of final subtype-specific features."

At first, most of these transcription factors are active in more than one type of cortical neuron, but after the animal is born, these proteins become increasingly restricted to just one type of neuron. In this way, the major classes of projection neurons are specified. However, the mechanisms defining the remarkable variety of projection neuron subtypes in the cerebral cortex are still largely unknown."

All neocortical areas are radially organized into six neuronal layers that show prominent diversities in features and functions despite similarities in their laminar organization. This is mainly due to differences in the molecular identity, morphology and long-range connectivity of residing neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Greig et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Huang, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">O'Leary et al., 2007</a>). Cortical projection neurons (PNs) can be subdivided into three major classes: (i) the intra-telencephalic (IT) neurons projecting to ipsilateral and/or, through the corpus callosum, to contralateral regions of the telencephalon (i.e. callosal projection neurons \u2013 CPN); (ii) the cortico-thalamic (CT) neurons projecting to different dorsal thalamic nuclei; and (iii) the pyramidal-tract (PT) neurons, also defined as subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN), that innervate different subcerebral targets, such as the striatum, the brainstem, and the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Shepherd, 2013</a>)."

For example, Satb2, a chromatin remodeling protein, drives CPN specification and axonal pathfinding, and represses the expression of the transcription factor Ctip2 (gene name <i>Bcl11b</i>), which controls the connectivity of SCPN (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alcamo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arlotta et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Baranek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Britanova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Srivatsa et al., 2014</a>). However, Satb2 was shown to control also subcerebral connectivity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Leone et al., 2014</a>), indicating that the final acquisition of a given cell type is not based on the function of a unique transcriptional regulator but most probably on the combination of more determinants expressed at different levels. This is in agreement with observations performed on early embryonic stages, where neuronal types are not yet fully specified and factors with mutually exclusive functions largely overlap. Notably, expression of transcriptional determinants tends to segregate after birth in a cell- or time-specific manner when neurons differentiate and the major neocortical classes become more distinct from each other (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib18\">Greig et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, it is still not clear whether the transcriptional regulators acting during early stages of neuronal specification play any additional roles during postnatal maturation when PNs acquire their final properties. Even if antithetic factors promoting callosal or subcerebral PNs can co-localize in a small subset of neurons after birth (<a href=\"#bib7\">Azim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Baranek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Leone et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tomassy et al., 2010</a>), it is not known whether their co-expression has a functional meaning, nor whether this hybrid molecular population corresponds to a permanent subgroup of cortical PNs. In particular, the persistence of few double Ctip2/Satb2-positive neurons at early postnatal stages of corticogenesis represents a conundrum, since Satb2 is a strong repressor of Ctip2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alcamo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Baranek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Britanova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Leone et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, Satb2 and Ctip2 regulate the expression of two netrin1 receptors (Unc5C and DCC, respectively) with opposite effects on axon guidance (<a href=\"#bib49\">Srivatsa et al., 2014</a>)."

Moreover, we demonstrate that the transcriptional adaptor Lmo4 allows the co-localization of Ctip2 and Satb2 by competing with Satb2 for the binding to Hdac1, a histone deacetylase normally recruited by the Satb2-NuRD complex bound to the Ctip2 locus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alcamo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Britanova et al., 2008</a>).

We thus examined the number and distribution of C/S+ cells from E14.5 to P21 to investigate whether they constitute a transient or rather a permanent population of cortical PNs. We first observed that while the number of single Ctip2+ and double C/S+ cells strongly decreases in the cortical plate from E14.5 to E16.5, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib31\">Leone et al., 2014</a>), double C/S+ (but not single Ctip2+) cells resurge between E16.5 and P0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>) and constitute 18% of lower layer (LL) neurons of the somatosensory cortex (S1) by P21 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Then, to verify whether the postnatal increase of C/S+ neurons was due just to a general increment in Ctip2 and Satb2 expression, we calculated the percentage of C/S+ cells on the total of Ctip2+ or Satb2+ cells and found an increase with respect to both populations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Satb2 is known to repress Ctip2 expression by recruiting the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which in turn deacetylates the\u00a0Ctip2 locus by interacting with the histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alcamo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Britanova et al., 2008</a>). The protooncogene Ski was shown to play a key role in the Hdac1-NuRD complex interaction (<a href=\"#bib8\">Baranek et al., 2012</a>); hence, we hypothesized that the resurgence of C/S+ cells at postnatal stages might be due to the down-regulation of Ski. On the contrary, Ski expression remained high from P0 to P21 and was observed also in several C/S+ cells after birth (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>), suggesting that a Ski-dependent mechanism is unlikely to contribute to the postnatal increase of C/S+ neurons in the S1 cortex."

This factor interacts with several components of the NuRD complex, is highly expressed in the rostral F/M region, where C/S+ are more abundant, and only in scattered cells of the pS cortex at P0 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cederquist et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gomez-Smith et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Singh et al., 2005</a>). Lmo4 expression gradually increases in S1 at postnatal stages, reaching its peak in LL at P7, then in all layers at P21 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The timing of Lmo4 expression is thus consistent with the increase of C/S+ cells in S1 from P0 to P21 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B-C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4B</a>), and accordingly, the number of triple Lmo4/Ctip2/Satb2-expressing cells progressively increases from P0 to P21 in layers V and VI (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Thus, the temporal and spatial dynamics of Lmo4 expression in C/S+ neurons indicate that this factor might favor their specification at peri- and postnatal stages of corticogenesis."

We examined Ctip2 and Satb2 expression in P7 <i>Lmo4\u00a0CKO</i> cortices, when normally a high number of S1 lower layer cells and 92% of double C/S+ cells express Lmo4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). Notably, the total number of both C/S+ and Ctip2+ cells is decreased in <i>Lmo4\u00a0CKO</i> S1 cortices (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>), whereas the number of Satb2-expressing cells is not particularly affected by the absence of Lmo4 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This might indicate that the alteration in C/S+ cells is mainly due to a general decrease in Ctip2 expression. However, the ratio of C/S+ cells decreased also compared to the total number of Ctip2+ (in upper layer V and VI) and Satb2+ cells (in layer VI) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Since the number and distribution of Satb2+ cells does not significantly change, the reduced number of C/S+ cells is most probably due to an increased repression of Ctip2 in Satb2+ neurons."

Previous work showed that corticospinal projection neurons (CSpPNs) were abnormally located in layer VIa of <i>Nr2f1 CKO</i> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tomassy et al., 2010</a>). By injecting CTB-coated beads either into the brainstem or the spinal cord regions of control and <i>Nr2f1</i> mutant brains, we observed an expansion of cortico-brainstem projection neurons (CBPNs) in layer Va and confirmed the mispositioning of the CSpPNs in upper layer VI of mutant cortices (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Interestingly, the highest percentage (66.4 \u00b1 6.7% ) of CBPNs co-expressing Ctip2 and Satb2 was in layer Va, whereas none of the labeled cells co-expressed these genes in layer VIa (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F and G</a>).

While GFP+ control cells co-localize with Lmo4 and Ctip2 (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), <i>Lmo4 shRNA-</i>expressing cells show a drastic reduction not only in Lmo4 expression, as expected, but also in Ctip2 levels in layer Va (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). This suggests that Ctip2 overexpression in layer Va is mainly due to Lmo4 increase and that <i>Nr2f1</i> loss not only upregulates Lmo4 levels but also favors its action on Ctip2 expression. In addition, cells electroporated with the control <i>shRNA</i> show a delayed migration to the apical region of the cortex, a phenotype that was already described in our previous publication (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alfano et al., 2011</a>).

Lmo4 was shown to bind Histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (Hdac1 and 2) to repress its downstream target genes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Singh et al., 2005</a>). Since the Hdac1-NuRD-Satb2 complex assembly is fundamental for Ctip2 repression (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alcamo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Baranek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Britanova et al., 2008</a>), we examined whether Lmo4 was able to compete with Satb2 for Hdac1 interaction. To this aim, we performed immunoprecipitation with Lmo4- and Satb2-specific antibodies on nuclear proteins extracted from control and <i>Nr2f1 CKO</i> P1 cortices, where Lmo4 and Ctip2 are strongly upregulated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Immunoprecipitated protein fractions were analyzed by Western blot using an antibody specific for Hdac1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alcamo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Britanova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gyorgy et al., 2008</a>). Comparable levels of Hdac1 were co-immunoprecipitated (Co-IP) with Lmo4 and Satb2 antibodies in control conditions, whereas Hdac1-Lmo4 interaction increased at the expense of Hdac1-Satb2 in <i>Nr2f1 CKO</i> brains. These changes in the amount of each complex were not due to dramatic changes in the total amount of Satb2 and Lmo4 proteins between wt and <i>Nr2f1</i> mutant brains. Indeed, Satb2 protein levels resulted unaltered between the two conditions, whereas the amount of Lmo4 resulted only slightly increased in <i>Nr2f1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Since the overall Lmo4 upregulation is not remarkable and takes place particularly in the mS1 cortex, the higher amount of Hdac1-Lmo4 complex in mutant Co-IP fractions might be due to a higher binding affinity between these factors in somatosensory regions. Accordingly, the number of C/S+ cells is remarkably higher in lower layers of S1 than in those of M1 in P7 wt brains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) despite similar Lmo4 levels between S1 and M1 areas (our data and (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2009</a>)."

Accordingly, none of the C/S+ CPNs identified here were positive for Sox5, whereas a group of C/S+ SCPNs clearly expressed Sox5. Our molecular analysis thus identified novel subclasses of SCPNs and CPNs major neuronal groups with distinct features, which can be specifically identified by Ctip2 andSatb2 co-expression."

This is also reminiscent of the observations made in <i>Satb2</i> mutant or <i>Fezf2</i>-overexpressing brains, where UL neurons acquire electrical features of LL neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">De la Rossa et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Leone et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, Ctip2+ neurons show higher ISI (first interspike interval) value than C/S+ cells. A similar variation in ISI values was previously described between UL and LL neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">De la Rossa et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that the co-expression of Satb2 in Ctip2+ layer V neurons may result in electrical features characteristic of UL neurons. Finally, since these variations in electrophysiological properties were observed by analyzing cells with similar morphologies, C/S+ and Ctip2+ neurons might diverge in the expression of ion channels and pumps (<a href=\"#bib38\">Oswald et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Staff et al., 2000</a>).

If Lmo4 and/or Satb2 and Ctip2 co-localization modulates axon targeting, what are their mechanisms of action? Ctip2 and Satb2 inhibit the expression of DCC and Unc5C, respectively,\u00a0two receptors of the guidance cue Netrin-1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Srivatsa et al., 2014</a>). Since these receptors are involved in the midline crossing of corticospinal axons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Finger et al., 2002</a>), one conceivable hypothesis would be that co-expression of Ctip2 and Satb2 inhibits both receptors, thus preventing subcerberal PNs to reach the spinal cord. Another explanation could be that Lmo4 inhibits neurite outgrowth by repressing the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Alk that plays key roles in neuritogenesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lasek et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, Lmo4 might interact with Lhx2, another LIM homeobox transcription factor known to regulate the expression of the guidance receptors Ephrin-A5 as well as Robo1 and 2, which in turn control different steps of corticospinal axon pathfinding (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marcos-Mondejar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shetty et al., 2013</a>). Thus, either Lmo4 expression or Ctip2 and Satb2 co-expression might control several neuronal processes allowing the correct maturation and/or refinement of PT and IT subtypes during postnatal stages of corticogenesis. We envisage that also other transcription factors normally involved in determining distinct classes of PNs during development, might take a similar postnatal function during cortical maturation."

The silhouette values were calculated for outcomes for each testing cycle starting from k\u00a0=\u00a02 to k\u00a0=\u00a05. After the optimal cluster number has been defined, clustering was performed with large number of iterations (iterations = 1000).

For whole-cell experiments, the slices (350 \u00b5m) were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) which comprised (mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 15 D-glucose, 0.05 picrotoxin, 0.05 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and 0.02 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), bubbled with O2:CO2: 95:5%. Visually\u00a0guided, whole-cell recordings were obtained at 29\u00b0C from the soma of GFP-positive cortical neurons in layer V of somatosensory area, using patch electrodes (3\u20135 M\u2126) filled with (in mM): 20 KCl, 100 Kgluconate, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 10 Na-phosphocreatine and 0.1% biocytin (Sigma Aldrich, Merck,\u00a0Germany). Recordings were performed using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 10 kHz and were not corrected for liquid junction potentials. Data were collected using ClampEx software and analyses of recorded responses were performed using Clampfit. The cells usually had a holding potential between -65 and -70 mV or were hold at these potentials. To calculate cell properties (resistance, time to peak, sag), currents from -200 pA to 80 pA were injected for 500\u00a0ms. The voltages were measured at the peak amplitude and at steady-state and the I-V curves were plotted. The slope of these curves corresponded to the resistance at peak (Rpeak) and at steady-state (Rss). The sag was measured as the difference of voltage at peak to the voltage at steady state when -200 pA was injected."

                                "text": "To measure firing and action potential properties, depolarasing currents were injected for 2 s by steps of 20 pA. The relationship between the amount of injected current and the firing frequency was then plotted. The ratio of the first interspike interval (ISI) to the last ISI was analyzed using responses recorded at two times the threshold current. To calculate action potential (AP) characteristics, we analyzed responses of cells at threshold current. Firing threshold is calculated as the interpolated membrane potential at which the derivative (dV/dt) equals 20 V/s. The firing threshold was set as the baseline to calculate characteristics of each AP (amplitude, half-width, duration, rise time). The fast afterhyperpolarization (fAHP) is the difference between the firing threshold and the minimum value found within 3 ms of the spike. The time of fAHP is the time between the peak of the spike and the fAHP. The depolarizing afterpolarization (DAP) following the fAHP (fDAP) is the difference between the maximum value obtained within 5 ms after the fAHP and the minimum value measured to calculate the fAHP. When bursts of 2 or 3 AP were fired at once, the threshold of the second AP was chosen as the maximum value to calculate the fDAP. The medium AHP (mAHP) is the difference between the threshold of AP and the minimum value found within 50 ms of the spike. The medium DAP (mDAP) is the difference between the maximum value found withnin 70 ms after the minimum value used to calculate the mAHP and this minimum value. When 2 or more APs were fired at once, the mAHP and mDAP were measured after the last AP of the burst."

However, some studies have detected co-expressing (C/S) neurons and this paper adds a new and exciting dimension by showing that major numbers of neurons co-expressing Satb2 and Ctip2 arise after birth, particularly in S1. C/S neurons fall into subsets with distinct morphology, electrophysiology and projection patterns. C/S neurons also express Lmo4. Lmo4 deletion inhibits Ctip2 but not Satb2 expression. Over-expressing the known Ctip2 activator, Fezf2, increased Ctip2+ cells but not C/S cells, consistent with Fezf2 inhibiting Satb2. But over-expressing Lmo4 together with Fezf2 increased both Ctip2+ and C/S cells, suggesting that Lmo4 overcomes Fezf2 inhibition of Satb2. Satb2 was reported to inhibit Ctip2 via HDAC/NuRD, and Lmo4 was reported to bind HDAC1/2. The authors tested whether Lmo4 might compete with Satb2 for HDAC1. They found that co-IP of HDAC1 with Satb2 is inhibited when Lmo4 expression is increased (in CoupTF mutant cortex). This suggests a competition model where Lmo4 robs HDAC1 from the Satb2-NuRD complex on the Ctip2 promoter, allowing co-expression and the creation of new classes of neurons."

There may be other effects of CoupTF1 knockout that explain the decreased co-IP. What happens with Lmo4 CKO? There should be increased co-IP of Satb2 and HDAC1. It would also be good to blot the lysates used in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> for total Lmo4, Satb2 and HDAC1. The competition argument would also be helped by simple co-expression in tissue culture cells (e.g., HEK293).

By combining retrograde tracings, the authors clearly showed that Ctip2/Satb2 co-expression defines 2 distinct neuronal subclasses projecting either to the contralateral cortex or to the brainstem. Thus Ctip2/Satb2 co-expression shapes their properties rather than determine their identity. Using Lmo4 cKO, Coup-TF1 cKO mice and IUE, they showed that Lmo4 drives this maturation program through modulation of epigenetic regulation in a time- and area-specific manner. The authors concluded that they have identified a previous unknown genetic program postnatally enhances neuronal subtype diversity in neocortical areas."

The co-expression does not define projection neuron subtype identity, as the C+S+ neurons project axons to either contralateral cortex or brainstem. Although the authors provided evidence for the existence of two subtypes of C+/S+ neurons that differ from C+/S- cells, without knowing the functional significance of Ctip2 and Satb2 co-expression, the authors' claim that the Lmo4-dependent epigenetic mechanism postnatally enhances neuronal subtype diversity in neocortical areas is stretched. My question is, how does Ctip2 and Satb2 co-expression make the neuron distinct from Ctip2+ Satb2- neurons?"

This result together with the in vivo evidence reported in Lmo4CKO brains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D-F</a>) and Lmo4 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A-E</a>), strongly support a key role for Lmo4 in modulating Ctip2 expression and allowing Ctip2 to be expressed in Satb2+ neurons."

                    "text": "We fully agree with the reviewer and indeed we never state that Ski is involved in the specification mechanism of double Ctip2/Satb2-expressing cells. On the contrary, we show in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> that despite high levels of Ski expression maintained after birth, the number of double C/S+ are increasingly generated and several are also positive for Ski, implying that the Ctip2 de-repression is Ski-independent. This is different from what normally happens during embryonic stages of development in which Ski interacts with Satb2 in the Ctip2 repression mechanism (as reported in Baranek et al., PNAS, 2011). Our study instead shows that Lmo4 disrupts the repression mechanism independently of the Ski-mediated mechanism. To fully support this last statement, we have now added a new Co-IP experiment by co-immunoprecipitating control and COUP-TFI CKO cortical protein extracts with the Lmo4-specific antibody and assessed the amount of bound Ski and Satb2 proteins by Western blot. As seen in the new version of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, no changes in protein interactions have been detected between the two conditions, indicating that Lmo4-mediated de-repression of Ctip2 does not involve Ski and/or Satb2."
