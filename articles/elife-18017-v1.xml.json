Mutation of a highly conserved 'gating charge' residue in the S4 helix (R1H) confers a resting-state H<sup>+</sup> 'shuttle' conductance (G<sub>SH</sub>) in VGCs and Ci VSP, and we now report that R1H is sufficient to reconstitute GSH in Hv1 without abrogating G<sub>AQ</sub>. Second-site mutations in S3 (D185A/H) and S4 (N4R) experimentally separate G<sub>SH</sub> and G<sub>AQ</sub> gating, which report thermodynamically distinct initial and final steps, respectively, in the Hv1 activation pathway. The effects of Hv1 mutations on G<sub>SH</sub> and G<sub>AQ</sub> are used to constrain the positions of key side chains in resting- and activated-state VS model structures and provides new insights into the structural basis of VS activation and H<sup>+</sup> transfer mechanisms in Hv1."
