However, a number of bacterial pathogens are resistant to the antimicrobial activities of macrophages and can grow within these cells. Macrophages have other immune surveillance roles including the acquisition of cytosolic components from multiple types of cells. We hypothesized that intracellular pathogens that can replicate within macrophages could also exploit cytosolic transfer to facilitate bacterial spread. We found that viable <i>Francisella tularensis</i>, as well as <i>Salmonella enterica</i> bacteria transferred from infected cells to uninfected macrophages along with other cytosolic material through a transient, contact dependent mechanism. Bacterial transfer occurred when the host cells exchanged plasma membrane proteins and cytosol via a trogocytosis related process leaving both donor and recipient cells intact and viable. Trogocytosis was strongly associated with infection in mice, suggesting that direct bacterial transfer occurs by this process in vivo."

In doing so, these bacteria can avoid being recognized and killed by the host\u2019s immune system. However, the ability of the bacteria to grow within the cell is constrained by the limited space and nutrients that are available inside the infected cell. The current theory is that most of these bacteria eventually kill the cell they have infected and are released into the body so that they can infect other host cells. However, since some host cells can exchange material with their neighbors, it is also possible that the bacteria may be able to travel directly between host cells without leaving the safety of the cell environment."

During this process, the membranes of the two participating cells briefly fuse and some of the proteins in the membranes are transferred from one cell to the other. Afterwards, the two cells separate but retain the membrane proteins they acquired from the other cell. The purpose of trogocytosis is poorly understood, but it is thought to help the host to develop immune responses against microbes and tumors."

The experiments show that two types of bacteria \u2013 called <i>Francisella tularensis</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> \u2013 can transfer from infected cells to macrophages via trogocytosis. Furthermore, the cells of mice infected with <i>F. tularensis</i> were more likely to undergo trogocytosis, which suggests that the bacterium may promote and use this process to spread throughout tissues in the body."

A future goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of trogocytosis so it may be possible to develop drugs that can inhibit the spread of the bacteria in patients."

In order to successfully continue propagation intracellular pathogens must continually infect new susceptible cells. Most of these organisms are thought to infect a cell, replicate, re-enter the extracellular space and start the process over again. However, re-entering the extracellular space exposes the pathogen to antibodies, complement, and other extracellular antimicrobial factors that can inhibit their growth or block their entry into new cells. It is therefore not surprising that certain intracellular pathogens have evolved mechanisms to transfer directly from infected to uninfected cells. The majority of intracellular bacterial pathogens that are known to transfer directly from cell to cell do so through a process known as actin based motility. While there are modest variations in the specific mechanisms employed by individual species, in general the process is pathogen driven through the expression of effector proteins that nucleate and polymerize host cell actin in a manner that physically propels the bacteria into a neighboring cell (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ireton, 2013</a>)."

Many recent studies have demonstrated that host cells can exchange cytosolic or membrane materials with neighboring cells through contact-dependent mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib14\">Joly and Hudrisier, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Rogers and Bhattacharya, 2013</a>). The exchange of cytosolic components occurs in different contexts across a wide range of distinct cells types, and there are several morphologically distinct mechanisms that exchange cytosolic material, including nanotubes, gap junctions, cytonemes and synapses (<a href=\"#bib20\">Onfelt et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Rogers and Bhattacharya, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kanaporis et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Roy et al., 2014</a>). The different exchange mechanism morphologies are associated with the transfer of specific types of material. For example, gap junctions are selectively permeable to ions and small molecules while nanotubes can transfer functional organelles from a donor to a recipient cell (<a href=\"#bib20\">Onfelt et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kanaporis et al., 2011</a>). Certain viral pathogens are known to transfer directly from cell to cell by exploiting one or more of these natural cellular processes. For example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transfers between cells via tunneling nanotubes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sowinski et al., 2008</a>), whereas Human T-lymphotophic virus (HTLV-1) can spread directly from infected to uninfected T-cells through virological synapses (<a href=\"#bib11\">Igakura et al., 2003</a>)."

For trogocytosis to occur two cells form a transient intimate interaction during which the membranes appear to fuse. The cells eventually separate, with each participant cell having acquired plasma membrane components from the partner cell. The transferred membrane proteins retain their orientation and their function until they are recycled via normal membrane turnover. In certain mouse tissues, over half of the cells have undergone detectable trogocytosis at any given time (<a href=\"#bib36\">Yamanaka et al., 2009</a>). In immune cells, trogocytosis leads to a variety of acquired functions that likely impact infection and immunity. For example, trogocytosis improves T cell signaling in response to antigens and dendritic cells can activate T cells after acquiring antigens from neighboring cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Osborne and Wetzel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Rosenits et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wakim and Bevan, 2011</a>). Trogocytosis has been implicated as a critical factor in several pathologies including cancer biology, tissue engraftment, and vaccination efficacy (<a href=\"#bib16\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chow et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chung et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Trogocytosis can occur without the transfer of cytosolic material (<a href=\"#bib22\">Puaux et al., 2006</a>), but it is unclear if the presumptive transient membrane fusion that occurs during certain types of cytosolic transfer also results in trogocytosis."

Foreign material including beads and <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> have been shown to transfer directly between macrophages (<a href=\"#bib20\">Onfelt et al., 2006</a>). But it is unclear how prevalent these transfer events are, how they influence pathogenesis, and if these transfer events benefit the pathogen (through cell to cell spread), the host (via immune detection or pathogen destruction upon transfer), or some combination of each. These questions are important because direct cell to cell transfer via cytosolic exchange could be a critical part of the infectious life-cycle for certain intracellular pathogens. For example, an estimated 60% of cells infected by HIV occur through direct viral transfer (<a href=\"#bib13\">Iwami et al., 2015</a>)."

Importantly, <i>F. tularensis</i> has not been shown to transfer between cells and lacks homologs of proteins that other bacteria use to transfer between cells. But the rapid spread of <i>F. tularensis</i> to new cells and cell types during infection suggests that direct cell to cell transfer may occur (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hall et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Roberts et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lindemann et al., 2011</a>). Here, we demonstrate that live <i>F. tularensis</i> bacteria transfer directly from infected cells to macrophages via a contact and cytosolic exchange dependent mechanism. Direct bacterial transfer appears to occur frequently both in vitro\u00a0and in a mouse infection model. Bacterial transfer was cell type specific and correlated strongly with trogocytosis, specifically the exchange of functional major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I). Lastly, we observed similar transfer events during infections with <i>Salmonella enterica</i> or fluorescent beads, suggesting that trogocytosis-associated cell to cell transfer may be a commonly exploited phenomenon."

In a mouse model of infection the number of <i>Francisella</i> infected cells increases dramatically over a short period of time (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hall et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Roberts et al., 2014</a>). This result suggested to us that <i>F. tularensis</i> could spread directly from infected to uninfected cells. To test this hypothesis we monitored GFP- <i>F. tularensis</i> infected J774A.1 macrophage-like (J774) cells by live cell imaging. We found that the bacteria transferred from infected to uninfected macrophages upon cell to cell contact (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). After bacterial transfer, both donor and recipient macrophages were typically motile following separation suggesting that both cells remained viable after bacterial transfer (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

We therefore screened numerous membrane altering factors for an inhibitor that blocked bacterial transfer and found that the addition of soy lecithin after infecting BMDM effectively blocked the transfer of <i>F. tularensis</i> to uninfected cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To test if the transferred bacteria could sustain infection, we infected approximately 1% of a BMDM population then added soy lecithin to inhibit cell to cell contact dependent bacterial transfer. We monitored bacterial viability over 3 days. Cells that cannot directly transfer bacteria will lyse after peak infection (~24\u2009hr), releasing their bacteria into antibiotic containing media. If the bacteria in the untreated cells survive transfer and are able to proliferate, bacterial viability should be higher in these samples than samples treated with soy lecithin at time points after peak infection. We found that both wild-type and transfer-inhibited cells reached peak infection at 24\u2009hr post inoculation, but the lecithin treated samples had significantly fewer viable bacteria compared to untreated samples at 48 and 72\u2009hr post inoculation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

During this cytosolic intermingling, the cells also exchange specific plasma membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib33\">Stinchcombe et al., 2001</a>). The cell to cell exchange of intact and functional plasma membrane proteins that retain their orientation is termed trogocytosis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Joly and Hudrisier, 2003</a>). We noted a similar phenomenon of plasma membrane transfer following bacterial transfer. Newly infected recipient BMDMs frequently acquired plasma membrane proteins as well as cytosolic material from the initially infected cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Interestingly, transferred plasma membrane proteins retained their orientation; so membrane proteins that were surface exposed on the initially infected cell were also surface exposed on the newly infected recipient cell. In the presented images, the cells were stained with a biotin succinimidyl ester prior to mixing the cells with differentially labelled BMDMs. The mixed population was then labeled with a fluorescent conjugated streptavidin immediately before fixation. As a result, the protein must be surface exposed before and after transfer to be labelled (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). These data are consistent with trogocytosis and imply that trogocytosis occurs at the same time as bacterial transfer. Importantly, these results indicate that trogocytosis can be used as a marker for bacterial transfer and differentiate direct <i>F. tularensis</i> transfer from more conventional infection mechanisms such as actin based motility or reinfection by extracellular bacteria."

We infected C57BL/6 (B6) BMDMs (MHC-I H2-Kb) and added uninfected Balb/c BMDMs (MHC-I H2-Kd) to the infected B6 cells. After 6\u2009hr of co-incubation, we assayed the Balb/c BMDMs for both <i>F. tularensis</i> infection and the acquisition of B6 MHC-I. We found that infection increased the amount of Balb/c BMDMs that acquired B6 MHC-I (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Likewise, newly infected Balb/c cells were significantly more likely to acquire B6 MHC-I than neighboring Balb/c cells that did not become infected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As with bacterial transfer, trogocytosis did not require <i>de novo</i> host or bacterial protein synthesis and was inhibited by treatment with lecithin (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We also observed MHC-I exchange during bacterial transfer when monitoring hMDMs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Unlike infections, beads did not increase the level of trogocytosis above baseline (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that a general bacterial factor increased the rate of trogocytosis and possibly bacterial transfer. But similar to bacterial transfer, the Balb/c macrophages that acquired beads also acquired B6 MHC-I at a significantly higher rate than macrophages that did not acquire beads (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The lower rate of total trogocytosis as well as the correlation between trogocytosis and transfer is likely due to phagocytosis of extracellular beads in the well. Taken together, our data demonstrate trogocytosis-associated transfer of intracellular bacteria is a mechanism that potentially any macrophage-tropic intracellular pathogen can exploit."

                        "text": "Our study demonstrates that intracellular bacteria can exploit a host cell cytosolic exchange mechanism to transfer directly from infected cells to macrophages. This cytosolic exchange mechanism is associated with trogocytosis, which is classically defined as the exchange of plasma membrane proteins between two cells. Given that lecithin inhibited both plasma membrane protein and bacterial transfer suggests that trogocytosis and cytosolic exchange are linked with respect to the mechanism of bacterial cell to cell transfer. The bacteria are viable after transfer and can use direct cell to cell transfer to sustain infection without entering the extracellular space. During infections, trogocytosis-associated transfer is a likely mechanism for <i>F. tularensis</i> dissemination. Alveolar macrophages are essentially the only cell type initially infected by <i>F. tularensis</i> following intranasal\u00a0inoculation in mice (<a href=\"#bib25\">Roberts et al., 2014</a>). Prior to peak infection dendritic cells become infected with <i>F. tularensis</i> and these newly infected cells traffic to the draining lymph node (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bar-Haim et al., 2008</a>). We postulate that direct cell to cell transfer is the mechanism for the bacteria to transfer from alveolar macrophages to these dendritic cells. Subsequent transfer events may also contribute to systemic dissemination from the lymph node."

In a confluent monolayer of primary cells, only 10\u201320% of macrophages became infected with <i>F. tularensis</i> via trogocytosis-associated transfer in a 6\u2009hr interval (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The efficiency of transfer is probably far lower in an infected host because fewer cells are infected and the concentrations of macrophages are much lower. Bacteria that encode mechanisms such as actin based motility likely increase the rate of cell to cell spread. Additionally, certain bacterial species use actin based motility to transfer between epithelial and endothelial cells, whereas <i>F. tularensis</i> does not (<a href=\"#bib18\">Makino et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Heinzen et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Reed et al., 2014</a>). It is possible these transfer mechanisms evolved so that these bacteria can transfer between cells types that do not undergo trogocytosis-associated transfer or to increase the rate of transfer."

The spread of bacteria aids in expanding the replicative niche and possibly dissemination. So why would the host undergo a process that is so potentially deleterious? In cancer biology, trogocytosis of pMHC-I and pMHC-II results in a cytotoxic T cell response to the tumor (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dolan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). The immune system may use a similar tactic during infection. Epithelial cells transfer whole antigen to macrophages and dendritic cells to initiate a T cell response via cytosolic exchange (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ramirez and Sigal, 2002</a>). Trogocytosis-associated transfer may be the mechanism for this antigenic dissemination. Our work focused on macrophages because <i>F. tularensis</i> primarily infects this cell type. However, macrophages are not an ideal cell type to stimulate an adaptive immune response. Future work on trogocytosis-associated transfer in dendritic cells or in the context of adaptive immunity may reveal an important immunological function for this process."

These results suggest that infected cells expressed a signal of some kind that initiated, enhanced, or stabilized trogocytosis. This signal is likely not soluble or generalizable because the frequency of trogocytosis only increased in infected cells, not neighboring uninfected cells in the same experimental sample. Trogocytosis is an important immunological process with broad consequences on host engraftment, vaccine efficacy, immune regulation and tumor recognition (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chow et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gu et al., 2012</a>).
