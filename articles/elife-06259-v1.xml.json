                    "text": "How the nervous system internally represents environmental food availability is poorly understood. Here, we show that quantitative information about food abundance is encoded by combinatorial neuron-specific gene-expression of conserved TGF\u03b2 and serotonin pathway components in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Crosstalk and auto-regulation between these pathways alters the shape, dynamic range, and population variance of the gene-expression responses of <i>daf-7</i> (TGF\u03b2) and <i>tph-1</i> (tryptophan hydroxylase) to food availability. These intricate regulatory features provide distinct mechanisms for TGF\u03b2 and serotonin signaling to tune the accuracy of this multi-neuron code: <i>daf-7</i> primarily regulates gene-expression variability, while <i>tph-1</i> primarily regulates the dynamic range of gene-expression responses. This code is functional because <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> mutations bidirectionally attenuate food level-dependent changes in lifespan. Our results reveal a neural code for food abundance and demonstrate that gene expression serves as an additional layer of information processing in the nervous system to control long-term physiology."

Here, we show that quantitative information about food abundance is encoded by combinatorial neuron-specific gene-expression of conserved TGF\u03b2 and serotonin pathway components in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Crosstalk and auto-regulation between these pathways alters the shape, dynamic range, and population variance of the gene-expression responses of <i>daf-7</i> (TGF\u03b2) and <i>tph-1</i> (tryptophan hydroxylase) to food availability. These intricate regulatory features provide distinct mechanisms for TGF\u03b2 and serotonin signaling to tune the accuracy of this multi-neuron code: <i>daf-7</i> primarily regulates gene-expression variability, while <i>tph-1</i> primarily regulates the dynamic range of gene-expression responses. This code is functional because <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> mutations bidirectionally attenuate food level-dependent changes in lifespan. Our results reveal a neural code for food abundance and demonstrate that gene expression serves as an additional layer of information processing in the nervous system to control long-term physiology."

A particularly interesting food-related response is the role of dietary restriction (DR) in modulating lifespan in diverse species (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mair and Dillin, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fontana et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alic and Partridge, 2011</a>).

We found that this circuit tunes its own accuracy, largely via the regulation of the dynamic range and variability of food-responsive gene expression by <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> signalling, respectively. Our work suggests that neural regulation of gene expression in conserved pathways can couple environmental sensation to physiological output, and highlights a novel mechanism for information processing by the nervous system to impact physiology."

To fully understand the response to food levels that <i>C. elegans</i> might encounter in the wild (<a href=\"#bib22\">Felix and Duveau, 2012</a>), we modified a well-established DR protocol (<a href=\"#bib30\">Greer et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) to measure the lifespans of wildtype animals shifted as day 2 adults to 19 concentrations of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> food source across \u223c11 orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

We found that lifespan increased and then decreased as bacterial concentration was reduced from the highest level, forming a DR response consistent with prior reports at high food ranges (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Panowski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Greer and Brunet, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mair et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ching et al., 2010</a>). Surprisingly, upon further reduction, lifespan increased again till a plateau was reached, suggesting that the initial decrease was not due to limiting nutrients. The longest lifespans occurred in the absence of bacteria, where the magnitudes of these effects were consistent with published dietary deprivation experiments (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaeberlein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). This relationship between lifespan and food abundance was maintained across temperatures (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting a robust food-sensing process. This multiphasic food response may reflect trade-offs between multiple food-regulated processes as previously discussed (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaeberlein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lee et al., 2006</a>).

Prior studies suggested that <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> mediate lifespan extension (<a href=\"#bib45\">Murakami and Murakami, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shaw et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">van der Goot et al., 2012</a>). We showed that their effects were in fact bidirectional: these genes could either extend or reduce lifespan in a food-specific manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2, 3</a>). Both single mutants had reduced lifespans at low food levels and increased lifespan at 6 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml in comparison to wildtype; additionally, <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> mutants were long-lived at the highest food level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The magnitude of lifespan changes we observed at high food levels (1 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> cells/ml) were comparable to prior studies performed at <i>ad libitum</i> food conditions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Murakami and Murakami, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shaw et al., 2007</a>). Intriguingly, <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> influenced the longevity response more strongly at low and high bacterial concentrations respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), suggesting that they act at different but overlapping ranges of food. Furthermore, the double mutant resembled the <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i> mutant at low bacterial levels and the <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> mutant at high bacterial levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), suggesting that these genes act in parallel rather than in a linear pathway. Together, these phenotypes indicate that <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> and <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i> mutants were neither intrinsically long- nor short-lived; instead, their phenotypes and genetic interactions were modulated by extensive gene-environment interactions."

This effect was manifested in the diminished range of lifespans across all food levels in both the <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> and <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i> single mutants, which was further reduced in the double mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This result also supports the idea that these genes act in parallel pathways. Furthermore, the mean lifespan across all food levels were similar in all the genotypes tested (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), suggesting that mutations in <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> lowered the food-responsive component of longevity around a consistent, food-independent lifespan that may be specified by other environmental parameters such as temperature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This bidirectional dampening of the food response and preservation of an underlying lifespan differs from previously described DR regulators, such as <i>aak-2</i>, <i>daf-16</i>, <i>pha-4</i> and <i>skn-1</i>, whose mutants abolish DR-mediated lifespan extension (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Greer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Panowski et al., 2007</a>). Thus, <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> mutants reveal a previously unobserved DR phenotype, and our results suggest that these genes mediate a bidirectional lifespan response to DR."

However, their expression profiles over a broad range of inputs remain unknown because manual studies limit the number of animals and environmental conditions that can be feasibly studied in a consistent way.

For brevity, we refer to these reporter activities as <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> expression.

Remarkably, we found that each neuron type had a specific pattern of activity across the six food levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Even with respect to a single gene, <i>tph-1</i>, the expression response in NSM differed from that in ADF, suggesting non-redundant roles of NSM and ADF in encoding bacterial abundance. Consistent with low <i>tph-1</i> expression in the absence of food (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), serotonin levels were reduced in NSM and ADF after starvation (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#bib38\">Liang et al., 2006</a>). Notably, the responses of <i>tph-1</i> in NSM and <i>daf-7</i> in ASI were non-monotonic, prohibiting unique representation of the food level using either of these readouts alone. The dynamic range and inter-individual variability of the three expression patterns also differed, suggesting different sensitivities towards the sensory input from food in different neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Moreover, the distributions of reporter intensity for each neuron type shifted in a graded manner across the six bacterial concentrations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) indicating that the expression of <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> could provide information about a continuous range of environmental inputs for individual animals. This graded response contrasts with many switch-like pathways, such as MAP kinase signalling, that produce outputs with a finite number of (usually two) stable states, where the population responds to changing environmental conditions by shifting sub-populations of cells from one state to another (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ferrell, 1996</a>)."

The results were summarized as matrices showing the frequency of each inferred food stimuli vs the actual food stimuli for each population (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). If the expression distributions were distinct (non-overlapping) across food levels, a correct inference was always obtained, resulting in a strongly diagonalized matrix (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, top). If the distributions overlapped entirely, then the food level inference was random and the values in the matrix were inversely related to the number of food conditions tested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom). Using expression data from NSM, ADF or ASI individually, we showed that each neuronal readout had some discriminatory power (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). When neuron pairs were combined, and particularly when all three neuron pairs were used, the accuracy improved (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This result suggests that non-redundant encoding by each neuron pair improves the accuracy of the overall representation. Generally, this coding system was best at distinguishing the highest and lowest food levels, consistent with the boom and bust lifestyle of <i>C. elegans</i> in the wild (<a href=\"#bib22\">Felix and Duveau, 2012</a>). Interestingly, the intermediate bacterial level, 6 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml, where we observed the lowest lifespan, also showed a heightened accuracy.

Thus, we explored the possibility that the internal representation based on <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> expression in wildtype animals emerges from their mutual regulation. Because our reporter transgenes were distinct from the endogenous genes, we were able to measure reporter expression in <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i> and <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> single and double mutants, which could reveal self- and cross-regulatory interactions. These measurements of reporter expression across six food levels uncovered new and extensive regulatory relationships between <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> that were neuron-specific and food-dependent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). First, <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> and <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i> mutants had non-redundant phenotypes, indicating that they acted in parallel pathways (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). For example, compared to the single mutants, the <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i>; <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> double mutant showed a greater increase in the expression of <i>tph-1</i> in NSM at the higher food levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, left). Second, we observed crosstalk between <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i>. Loss of <i>daf-7</i> signalling affected <i>tph-1</i> expression in both NSM and ADF neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, left and middle) while loss of <i>tph-1</i> affected <i>daf-7</i> expression in the ASI neuron at higher bacterial concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, right). Third, both <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> regulated their own expression. <i>tph-1</i> expression in NSM and ADF was altered in <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, left and middle) and <i>daf-7</i> expression in ASI was altered in <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, right).

Lifespan increases and decreases as a function of food abundance. The phenotypes of <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i> and <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> mutants reveal that rather than serving intrinsic roles in lifespan extension, serotonin and TGF\u03b2 are signals required for bidirectional food-dependent lifespan changes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This bidirectional phenotype was only revealed by analysis of lifespan across a very broad range of food levels. Many genes have been implicated in lifespan modulation or DR-related responses; a systematic analysis under additional conditions may provide new insights on their roles in food-dependent responses. That <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> act in food-responsive sensory neurons, together with the bidirectional attenuation of lifespan responses in the single and double mutants suggests that loss of <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> impairs the ability to sense and/or convey information about food levels, leading to a flattened response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This interpretation is further supported by the observations that loss of <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> reduced the dynamic range of lifespan responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and lowered the accuracy of food level representation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> have established functional connections to conserved pathways for regulating metabolism, cellular maintenance, reproduction and longevity, such as the insulin/IGF pathway (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shaw et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Narasimhan et al., 2011</a>).

Several results indicate that <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> account for a substantial if not the majority of the food response in lifespan modulation. First, loss of both <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> reduced the dynamic range of the lifespan response to food by \u223c60% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Second, the decoding analysis, which systematically considers the overlap between multiple response distributions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), showed that much of the information about food levels is lost in the <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i>; <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> double mutant: the predictive accuracy of the lifespan response drops to 5% above random (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Third, the predictive accuracy of gene expression and lifespan are heterogeneous\u2014certain food levels were correctly predicted with far higher accuracy (&gt;75%) than the average accuracy (see decoding matrices in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4D, 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This heterogeneous performance is due in part to non-monotonic expression responses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), as some food levels lead to similar responses. Fourth, it is important to note that an encoding system only needs to match the accuracy of the output to be good enough for regulating a biological process. The mean accuracy of lifespan responses to food thus provides a biologically relevant limit on the required performance for encoding food levels. In this light, the comparable mean accuracy between <i>daf-7</i>/<i>tph-1</i> gene expression and lifespan indicates that the performance of the coding system is well suited to the accuracy of the process it modulates. Fifth, we found corresponding drops in the predictive accuracy of both gene expression and lifespan across <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> and <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i> mutants (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). This result is particularly remarkable because the predictive accuracy depends on not just the means but also variances. While these results support the idea that <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> functionally encode significant information about food levels, the <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i>; <i>daf-7(\u2212)</i> double mutant still retains some information about food, as shown by its lifespan response to food and its predictive accuracy of food (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C, 6F</a>).

Genetic epistasis between <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> had suggested that these two genes functioned in the same pathway (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sze et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2006</a>). Our results indicate that <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> are likely to act in parallel to modulate lifespan in response to food, and that their mutual regulation represents crosstalk between these two pathways. First, we found that their epistatic relationships are food-dependent rather than hard-wired. This result is reminiscent of another food-dependent epistasis between neuropeptide and catecholamine receptors (<i>npr-1</i> and <i>tyra-3</i> respectively) that act in <i>C. elegans</i> sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bendesky et al., 2011</a>). Perhaps crosstalk during sensory processing leads to more complex genetic interactions. Second, <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> play distinct regulatory roles in shaping the food representation and tuning discriminatory power (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5D, 6D</a>; discussed below). Third, <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> show additive phenotypes in both gene-expression responses and predictive accuracy of lifespan (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A, 6F</a>). Since the predictive accuracy reflects the information content on food, the additive loss indicates that <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> carry non-redundant information about food abundance. Together, these results point to parallel rather than sequential signalling for serotonin and TGF\u03b2."

Different regulatory interactions between <i>daf-7</i> and <i>tph-1</i> modulate encoding capacity in specific ways, revealing novel system-level roles for these interactions. <i>tph-1</i> activity limits the dynamic range, and consequently the representative capacity of <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> expression in response to food. It is possible that the increased dynamic range of <i>daf-7</i> expression in <i>tph-1(\u2212)</i> animals may partially compensate for the loss of <i>tph-1</i> as a major functional encoder. Surprisingly, <i>tph-1</i> self-regulation indicates that <i>tph-1</i> and serotonin signaling is likely to self-limit representative capacity by reducing the dynamic range. In contrast, the cross-regulatory effect of <i>daf-7</i> is necessary to reduce variability in <i>tph-1</i> expression, which represents a new component of <i>tph-1</i> expression that is regulated by <i>daf-7</i>. The parity in encoding performance between <i>tph-1</i> and <i>daf-7</i> expression and lifespan (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>), along with the attenuation of lifespan response in the mutants, suggests that this neuronal representation has major functional information-carrying capacity. Distributing a combinatorial code across multiple neurons with distinct responses ensures robustness of signal fidelity against variability in each neuron-type, analogous to population codes in certain sensory circuits (<a href=\"#bib59\">Singer and Gray, 1995</a>). Furthermore, a distributed code enables multicellular organisms to implement additional layers of regulation unavailable to unicellular organisms."

By measuring this variation in neurons using high-throughput quantitative microscopy, we highlight implications of this variability in encoding food levels in nervous system, which have not been extensively explored in intact animals and are likely to be generalizable to other neural processes. First, gene-expression variability limits the accuracy of neural food representations. Second, this variability can be regulated, as shown by the role of TGF\u03b2 in reducing variability in serotonin signaling to increase fidelity. Third, in this TGF\u03b2 and serotonin circuit, the effects of variability are tempered by the dynamic range of responses (which can reduce the overlap between broad distributions) and by the use of multiple neurons. Thus, the overall fidelity of information processing is shaped at least in part by an interplay of variability and other parameters."

Animals were suspended in S Basal + streptomycin on day 6 of adulthood and introduced into our custom microfluidic device via pressure driven flow (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chung et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Crane et al., 2012</a>). Briefly, microfluidic devices were manufactured in polydimethylsiloxane using standard multilayer soft lithographic techniques (<a href=\"#bib62\">Unger et al., 2000</a>) and covalently bonded to a glass coverslip via oxygen plasma treatment. On the device, individual animals were sequentially directed into and trapped within an imaging channel gated by pressure-driven on-chip valves (<a href=\"#bib62\">Unger et al., 2000</a>) under the control of custom LabVIEW software (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Dense, 2-micron fluorescent z-stacks through head of each worm were collected using a standard epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope) with a 40\u00d7 oil objective (1.3 NA) and a Hamamatsu Orca R2 camera. Red and green fluorescent intensities for each of our fluorescent reporters were collected simultaneously using an Optosplit II emission splitter and stored for analysis. We automated the image acquisition and image processing using custom LabVIEW and MATLAB scripts; the analysis software is deposited at <a href=\"https://github.com/meizhan/SVMelegans\">https://github.com/meizhan/SVMelegans</a>."

To identify neuron-pairs and their locations within the imaging plane, maximum projections were computed and a thresholding algorithm was utilized to locate individual fluorescent cells. Identifications of the cells were then computed based on relative distances and locations within the worm head. For quantification, the three dimensional volume around each cellular location was extracted from the full z-stack and intensity was integrated over a consistent number of the brightest pixels, which fully encapsulate the entire cell in all cases. To avoid potential interference from condition-specific changes in the gut auto-fluorescence, the background intensity was calculated for cell pairs near the gut (ADF, ASI), via estimation of the mode of the intensity distribution in a volume around the neuron. This background intensity value was subtracted from the integrated fluorescence to obtain the final output."

To do this we randomly segmented the data into five test groups. For each test group, we computed expression or lifespan probability distributions for each food level based on the remaining data (the training set). We employed a multivariate Gaussian distribution to fit the expression data and a Weibull distribution for lifespan data. Using these probability distributions, we then calculated the conditional probability that each member of the test group had their particular expression or lifespan output if they had been subjected to each of the food levels. The accuracy of these raw probability values can be found in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> panels A, C, E and G. To make a final inference about the food level each worm was subjected to, the animal was assumed to have come from the food level with the highest conditional probability. The encoding accuracy of this maximum likelihood model can be found in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> panels B, D, F, and H.

Although the effects of food signals on <i>tph-1::gfp</i> and <i>daf-7::gfp</i> expression and 5-HT and <i>DAF-7</i> on ageing have been studied before, this work provides several novel insights, by generating single copy <i>tph-1::gfp</i> and <i>daf-7::gfp</i> transgenic lines and systematically monitoring the expression levels in animals grown on a wide-range of <i>E. coli</i> food concentrations.

First, transgenic expression of <i>tph-1</i> in ADF or NSM restored the lifespan as a function of food availability.
