The main chemosensory organ is located on the head, and the small spatial separation of the bilateral olfactory receptors makes it unlikely that the animal can detect the instantaneous odour gradient. In fact, it has been shown that larvae can still chemotax with a single active receptor (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fishilevich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Louis et al., 2008</a>). The key information used by the larva appears to be the change in odour concentration experienced as it moves forward and/or casts its head sideways (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2010</a>). Olfactory sensory neurons are well suited to carry this information as they have been shown to give strong transient responses during changes in odour concentration (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Palo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nagel and Wilson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schulze et al., 2015</a>) and the frequency and direction of turns (large body bends leading to a new trajectory direction) appears correlated to decreases or increases in the perceived concentration (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hernandez-Nunez et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schulze et al., 2015</a>). Other sensory modalities could in principle use spatially separated sensors to detect instantaneous gradients across the body to direct steering, but recent studies reveal substantial similarity in the characteristics of larval taxis behaviour across different modalities (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gepner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bellmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lahiri et al., 2011</a>).

These models typically assume the expression of taxis consists of multiple behavioural states with state transitions that are biased by sensory stimuli. In <a href=\"#bib13\">Davies et al.

Each contributes to the\u00a0improvement of\u00a0odour taxis performance, and in theory, each could be individually modulated by sensory stimuli characteristics, context, other stimuli, or learning, in\u00a0a manner that modifies the observed odour preferences. However, behavioural observation shows rather strong similarities in the behavioural modulations resulting from apparently unrelated conditions, such as odour-tastant associative learning and variation of stimulus concentration (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schleyer et al., 2015a</a>), which simultaneously modulate both the klinokinetic and klinotactic responses (weathervaning was not assessed in this study). Also, a recent attempt to categorise larval behavioural states using an unsupervised method based on the animal\u2019s posture suggests the existence of a continuum rather than clear-cut categories (<a href=\"#bib61\">Szigeti et al., 2015</a>)."

This reveals a continuous alternation between left and right turns, which appears most clearly in the angular velocity of the anterior part of the body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> \u2018blue line\u2019). Larvae are known to regularly stop their forward peristalsis motion and display large lateral head sweeps (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</a>). A closer look shows that these head sweeps do not seem to break the continuous alternation between left and right turns, i.e., if the larva\u2019s head was moving left before stopping the peristalsis motion, the first head sweep after stopping will be to the right, and vice versa (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Thus, these head sweeps appear to be part of a continuous oscillation rather than individual motor actions triggered independently. Also, the distribution of body bending, anterior body angular velocity and acceleration, as well as the extent of each lateral oscillation of the anterior body, show a smooth curve with no signs of bimodality (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) suggesting a continuum of turning modulation rather than a discrete set of distinguishable actions."

(<b>B</b>) Path\u00a0section with an intermediate (1) and two stronger (2 and 3) peristalsis inhibition events\u00a0that do not interrupt\u00a0the\u00a0turning alternation. (<b>C</b>) Path\u00a0section with\u00a0a peristalsis inhibition event covering two successive turns (4 and 5). The green\u00a0vertical bars (1 and 2) indicate moments at which the body bending decreases (from left to right) even though the larva anterior body is still slightly swinging towards the left. This is due to the simultaneous forward peristalsis motion bringing the posterior part of the body towards the axis of the anterior part.\u00a0The angular speed of the anterior body provides thus a better proxy than body bend to infer the control commands involved. (<b>B</b>,<b>C</b>) Red dotted lines indicate the\u00a0onset of peristalsis inhibition (conservatively late measure) which occurs before any strong changes in angular speed or body bending."

Tail speed (peristalsis) rhythm is fairly constant across larvae at around 1.0\u00a0Hz, with slight harmonics of the tail speed at 0.5\u00a0Hz, which results from the tendency of some larvae to alternate continuously between a weaker and stronger peristalsis wave (see\u00a0<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>'s tail speed for an example). The angular velocity of the anterior body (blue) shows a slower rhythm than the peristalsis, with a higher variation across and within individuals.

This turning oscillation seems decoupled from the peristalsis motion (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which operates around a mean frequency of 1.1 Hz (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, green). The peristalsis rhythm appears remarkably constant, perhaps because of biomechanical constraints (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ross et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, a direct coupling between peristalsis and turning oscillation would constrain the larvae to spend as much time sweeping left as sweeping right, which would restrict the flexibility in trajectory alterations. By having the lateral oscillations decoupled from peristalsis, however, the relative duration between left and right sweeps can vary. This is indeed what we observed in larvae. A curving path to the left for instance, is achieved by spending slightly more time (and also increasing the angular speed of the head sweep) sweeping left than sweeping right (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> \u2018blue region\u2019: Time spent turning right = 12.9\u00a0s; Time spent turning left = 22.9\u00a0s; Ratio right/left\u00a0= 0.64.

Even-though larvae show larger and quicker head sweeps when the peristalsis motion has stopped (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), the head sweep duration is similar between crawling phases and stop phases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), suggesting again the existence of a shared underlying oscillatory rhythm."

In our abstract model, the baseline is set to 10 degrees to fit roughly the data observed in larvae, but taxis emerges even for extreme values such as 160 degrees, showing that the principle behind our model (i.e. sensory modulation of continuous lateral oscillation) provides a robust way of achieving taxis. Up-regulating turn towards 180 degrees (i.e. when a negative transient is perceived) appears more important than down-regulating turn towards 0 degrees (i.e. when a positive transient is perceived); however, taxis still emerges by only down-regulating turns when the baseline angle is large and leaves enough range for modulation. We have reasons to think that larvae achieve taxis by dual regulation, that is, by performing both up-regulation and down-regulation of turns (see for Discussion our supplemental text: \u2018Depolarisation and hyperpolarisation rather than ON and OFF cells\u2019)."

Examination of actual larvae paths reveals similar signature: crossing-over trajectories emerge when close to the odour source [except for the Or42a single receptor mutant larvae, that show an orbital behaviour (see below)], which indeed results in a flattening of the distribution curve (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,D</a>)."

The CPG consists of a pair of compartments, here taken to be driving the changes in the\u00a0agent\u2019s heading (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Each compartment has a pool of self-connected excitatory neurons (<math id=\"inf67\"><mi>E</mi></math>), and a cross-inhibitory interneuron (<math id=\"inf68\"><mi>C</mi></math>) projecting to the other compartment. This produces a regular alternation in firing bursts between left and right sides that can be modified by the additional bilateral inputs, <math id=\"inf69\"><mi>A</mi></math> and <math id=\"inf70\"><mi>S</mi></math>. The <math id=\"inf71\"><mi>A</mi></math> unit represents descending sensory signals either processed or direct, while the <math id=\"inf72\"><mi>S</mi></math> unit represents a modulatory signal.

We take this continuous oscillation to be the underlying basis for larval behaviours that are often treated as distinct states triggered by dedicated sensory motor processes (see <a href=\"#bib27\">Green et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sawin et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cobb, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Vogelstein et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib50\">Ohashi et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib23\">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hernandez-Nunez et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gepner et al., 2015</a>).

Growing signal strength increases anterior body angular velocity (blue) and inhibits crawling speed (green) simultaneously. If the signal is sufficiently strong peristalsis disruption happens (arrow), leading to an abrupt drop of tail speed velocities. The relaxing of the peristaltic synchronous left-right body contraction enhances the reaction to the thoracic left-right asynchronous oscillatory contraction, thus resulting in sharp increase in head sweep amplitude. Peristalsis spontaneously resumes when the sensory command lowers below peristalsis disruption threshold.

The effective strength of signal transmission is changed by synaptic plasticity that may result in inverting the relative balance between the MB outputs that control attraction vs. aversion (as in the adult [<a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">Owald et al., 2015</a>]) in an odour-specific manner.

Fast escape responses involve reduced head sweeping and rapid crawling (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>). In some paradigms, crawling speed and turning amplitude are not so clearly inversely correlated, e.g., large step increases in ethyl acetate concentration decrease turn-rate but reveal only a weak non-significant increase in speed (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gershow et al., 2012</a>); however, in the same paper, when the larvae move in a spatial gradient, the inverse correlation between speed and turn-rate is observed. In addition, peristalsis and head sweeps cease together under some conditions, e.g., sudden light offsets (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kane et al., 2013</a>), but this may be a freezing reaction unrelated to normal taxis behaviour."

However, our model suggests that the mushroom body pathway is yet another pathway that converges to modify the effective gain in the motor system, and thus MBON valence would also be sensitive to activation timing. That is, it should not be possible to yield a change in odour attraction behaviour via optogenetic activation of a target MBON unless the stimulus respects the timing sensitivity of the larval oscillator, mimicking a closed-loop motor action-stimulation."

Despite their simplicity, our models capture a remarkable number of taxis phenomena observed in larvae and suggest an elegant picture in which all types of sensory signals, mono or multi-modal, can combine by simply converging on the single process that lies at the core of taxis: a turning oscillator. Additional new features such as different sensory receptors or intermediate relays, such as the MB pathway, can be directly integrated, and their respective influence can be modulated by simply changing the intensity of their signals."

This simplification is justified in terms of our finding that the peristaltic wave peaks are uncorrelated with the body bending and thus can be taken as slow motion of the posterior body segment following the heading direction indicated. However, our model does not capture the straightening of the body bend due to this motion, or the friction forces exerted from the contact with the ground withholding the restoration. Given that the oscillation is driven by the premotor neuron activity and that the larva is assumed to continuously move at constant speed, the details of how the body bending is restored have been simplified out in our model to be driven by restorative elastic forces of the body. We take a non-dimensionalized approach writing the muscle model driving the head as second order system of idealized spring-mass-damper (see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib18\">Fung, 2013</a>):"

They then use an idealized computational model to test the hypothesis that modulation of such oscillation in the head is sufficient to reproduce the different orientation strategies observed in the larva (weathervaning, klinotaxis, and klinokinesis). This result is significant because larval taxis has been typically characterized as transitions between multiple behaviors, and this computational model shows a proof of concept that such an assumption is not necessary \u2013 and that a simpler strategy is sufficient to account for the observed behavior. The authors present a second model that is continuous in time, to further validate their hypothesis. One of the interesting insights is that the descending sensory signals that control the behavior do not need to be stronger on the different sides of the body. This result echoes the model presented by Izquierdo and Lockery, 2009, as the authors acknowledge."

So being able to condition a larva to turn left would not falsify the model; conversely the failure of lateralized operant conditioning could indeed be due to a lack of lateralized internal representation but also to a number of other causes (to my knowledge, no one has demonstrated that larvae can be operantly conditioned in any context).

Further, current research indicates that olfactory receptor neurons do not respond linearly to odor concentrations (or to changes in odor concentration) and that behavioral responses to olfactory neuron activity are also nonlinear. It's completely fine to present a simplified model, especially if it makes it easier to understand the main features, but too much of the paper then focuses on the trivial results of adjusting these simplified model parameters."

For reduced models that do not attempt to represent the full neural pathway, the \"gain\" may instead represent a transformation from odor concentration to activity in some downstream neuron or a more generalized neural representation of odor quality and quantity. In the case, as presented here, that the gain simply multiplies the input stimulus, inverting the gain is mathematically equivalent to inverting the input stimulus, with the effect that taxis towards high concentration becomes taxis towards low concentration and vice versa. It is a completely trivial result that a switch from attraction to aversion can be effected by inverting the gain; to understand learning the interesting research question, not addressed in this work, is how this inversion is accomplished, especially in an odor-specific manner."
