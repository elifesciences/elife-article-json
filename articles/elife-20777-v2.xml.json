Here, we identified 23,095 TE presence/absence variants between 216 Arabidopsis accessions. Most TE variants were rare, and we find these rare variants associated with local extremes of gene expression and DNA methylation levels within the population. Of the common alleles identified, two thirds were not in linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, implicating these variants as a source of novel genetic diversity. Many common TE variants were associated with significantly altered expression of nearby genes, and a major fraction of inter-accession DNA methylation differences were associated with nearby TE insertions. Overall, this demonstrates that TE variants are a rich source of genetic diversity that likely plays an important role in facilitating epigenomic and transcriptional differences between individuals, and indicates a strong genetic basis for epigenetic variation."

Here, we identified 23,095 TE presence/absence variants between 216 Arabidopsis accessions. Most TE variants were rare, and we find these rare variants associated with local extremes of gene expression and DNA methylation levels within the population. Of the common alleles identified, two thirds were not in linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, implicating these variants as a source of novel genetic diversity. Many common TE variants were associated with significantly altered expression of nearby genes, and a major fraction of inter-accession DNA methylation differences were associated with nearby TE insertions. Overall, this demonstrates that TE variants are a rich source of genetic diversity that likely plays an important role in facilitating epigenomic and transcriptional differences between individuals, and indicates a strong genetic basis for epigenetic variation."

                        "text": "Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements present in nearly all studied organisms, and comprise a large fraction of most eukaryotic genomes. The two types of TEs are retrotransposons, which transpose via an RNA intermediate requiring a reverse transcription reaction, and DNA transposons, which transpose via either a cut-paste or, in the case of Helitrons, a rolling circle mechanism with no RNA intermediate (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wicker et al., 2007</a>). TE activity poses mutagenic potential as a TE insertion may disrupt functional regions of the genome. Consequently, safeguard mechanisms have evolved to suppress this activity, including the methylation of cytosine nucleotides (DNA methylation) to produce 5-methylcytosine (mC), a modification that can induce transcriptional silencing of the methylated locus. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (Arabidopsis), DNA methylation occurs in three DNA sequence contexts: mCG, mCHG, and mCHH, where H is any base but G. Establishment of DNA methylation marks can be carried out by two distinct pathways\u2014the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway guided by 24 nucleotide (nt) small RNAs (smRNAs), and the DDM1/CMT2 pathway (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zemach et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</a>). A major function of DNA methylation in Arabidopsis is in the transcriptional silencing of TEs. Mutations in genes essential for DNA methylation establishment or maintenance can lead to a decrease in DNA methylation levels, expression of previously silent TEs, and in some cases transposition (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mirouze et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Miura et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Saze et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lippman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jeddeloh et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zemach et al., 2013</a>). In Arabidopsis, TEs are often methylated in all cytosine sequence contexts, in a pattern distinct from DNA methylation in other regions of the genome. Conversely, DNA methylation often occurs in gene bodies exclusively in the CG context and is correlated with gene expression, although this gene-body methylation appears dispensable (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bewick et al., 2016</a>). Many thousands of regions of the Arabidopsis genome have been identified as differentially methylated between different wild Arabidopsis accessions, although the cause and possible function of these differentially methylated regions remains unclear (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "TEs are thought to play an important role in evolution, not only because of the disruptive potential of their transposition. The release of transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing of TEs can lead to bursts of TE activity, rapidly generating new genetic diversity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vitte et al., 2014</a>). TEs may carry regulatory information such as promoters and transcription factor binding sites, and their mobilization may lead to the creation or expansion of gene regulatory networks (<a href=\"#bib19\">H\u00e9naff et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bolger et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ito et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Makarevitch et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the transposase enzymes required and encoded by TEs have frequently been domesticated and repurposed as endogenous proteins, such as the <i>DAYSLEEPER</i> gene in Arabidopsis, derived from a hAT transposase enzyme (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bundock and Hooykaas, 2005</a>). Clearly, the activity of TEs can have widespread and unpredictable effects on the host genome. However, the identification of TE presence/absence variants in genomes has remained difficult to date. It is challenging to identify the structural changes in the genome caused by TE mobilization using current short-read sequencing technologies as these reads are typically mapped to a reference genome, which has the effect of masking structural changes that may be present. However, in terms of the number of base pairs affected, a large fraction of genetic differences between Arabidopsis accessions appears to be due to variation in TE content (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Quadrana et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, identification of TE variants is essential in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic variation that exists between genomes, and of the consequences of TE movement on genome and cellular function."

We applied our TE variant identification method to existing genome resequencing data for 216 different Arabidopsis accessions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>), identifying widespread TE variation amongst these accessions and enabling exploration of TE diversity and links to gene regulation and epigenomic variation."

TEPID integrates split and discordant read mapping information, read mapping quality, sequencing breakpoints, as well as local variations in sequencing coverage to identify novel TE presence/absence variants with respect to a reference TE annotation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). This typically takes 5\u201310 min per accession for Arabidopsis genomic DNA sequencing data at 20-40x coverage, excluding the read mapping step. After TE variant discovery has been performed, TEPID then includes a second refinement step designed for population studies. This examines each region of the genome where there was a TE presence identified in any of the analyzed samples, and checks for evidence of this insertion in all other samples. In this way, TEPID leverages TE variant information for a group of related samples to reduce false negative calls within the group. Testing of TEPID using simulated TE variants in the Arabidopsis genome showed that it was able to reliably detect simulated TE variants at sequencing coverage levels commonly used in genomics studies (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Previously published 100 bp paired-end L<i>er</i> genome resequencing reads (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schneeberger et al., 2011</a>) were first analyzed using TEPID, enabling identification of 446 TE presence variants (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) and 758 TE absence variants (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>) with respect to the Col-0 reference TE annotation. Reads providing evidence for these variants were then mapped to the L<i>er</i> reference genome, generated by de novo assembly using Pacific Biosciences P5-C3 chemistry with a 20 kb insert library (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chin et al., 2013</a>), using the same alignment parameters as were used to map reads to the Col-0 reference genome. This resulted in 98.7% of reads being aligned concordantly to the L<i>er</i> reference, whereas 100% aligned discordantly or as split reads to the Col-0 reference genome (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To find whether reads mapped to homologous regions in both the Col-0 and L<i>er</i> reference genomes, we conducted a BLAST search (<a href=\"#bib6\">Camacho et al., 2009</a>) using the DNA sequence between read pair mapping locations in the L<i>er</i> genome against the Col-0 genome, and found the top BLAST result for 80% of reads providing evidence for TE insertions, and 89% of reads providing evidence for TE absence variants in L<i>er</i>, to be located within 200 bp of the TE variant reported by TEPID. Thus, reads providing evidence for TE variants map discordantly or as split reads when mapped to the Col-0 reference genome, but map concordantly to homologous regions of the L<i>er</i> de novo assembled reference genome, indicating that structural variation is present at the sites identified by TEPID, and that this is resolved in the de novo assembled genome."

We found that 89.6% (173/193) of these TE absences were also identified using TEPID, indicating a false negative rate of\u00a0~10% for TE absence calls. To determine the rate of false negative TE presence calls, we ran TEPID using 90 bp paired-end Col-0 reads (Col-0 control samples from <a href=\"#bib22\">[Jiang et al., 2014</a>]), aligning reads to the L<i>er</i> PacBio assembly. As TEPID requires a high-quality TE annotation to discover TE variants, which is not available for the L<i>er</i> assembly, we looked for discordant and split read evidence at the known Col-0-specific TEs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Quadrana et al., 2016</a>), and found evidence reaching the TEPID threshold for a TE presence call to be made at 89.6% (173/193) of these sites, indicating a false negative rate of\u00a0~10%. However, it should be noted that this estimate does not take into account the TEPID refinement step used on large populations, and so the false negative rate for samples analyzed in the population from Schmitz et al. (2013) is likely to be lower than this estimate, as each accession gained on average 4% more presence calls following this refinement step (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

A recent study focused on identifying recent TE insertions containing target site duplications in this population (<a href=\"#bib34\">Quadrana et al., 2016</a>). Our goal was to provide a comprehensive assessment of TE presence/absence variation in Arabidopsis. In most accessions TEPID identified 300\u2013500 TE presence variants (mean\u00a0=\u00a0378) and 1000\u20131500 TE absence variants (mean\u00a0=\u00a01279), the majority of which were shared by two or more accessions (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although more TE absences were found on an accession-by-accession basis, overall TE presence variants were more common in the population as the TE absences were often shared between multiple accessions. PCR validations were performed for a random subset of 10 presence and 10 absence variants in 14 accessions (totalling 280 validations), confirming the high accuracy of TE variant discovery using the TEPID package, with a false positive rate for both TE presence and TE absence identification of\u00a0~9%, similar to that observed using simulated data and the L<i>er</i> genome analysis (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The number of TE presence variants identified was positively correlated with sequencing depth of coverage, while the number of TE absence variants identified had no correlation with sequencing coverage (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>), indicating that the sensitivity of TE absence calls is not limited by sequencing depth, while TE presence identification benefits from high sequencing depth. However, accessions with low coverage gained more TE presence calls during the TEPID refinement step (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>), indicating that these false negatives were effectively reduced by leveraging TE variant information for the whole population."

To do this, the minor allele frequency (MAF) of each variant in the population was examined, under the expectation that the minor allele is the derived allele. Common TE absences relative to Col-0, absent in \u226580% of the accessions examined, were re-classified as TE insertions in Col-0, and common TE presences relative to Col-0, present in \u226580% of accessions, as true TE deletions in Col-0. Cases where the TE variant had a high MAF (&gt;20%) were unable to be classified, as it could not be determined if these were cases where the variant was most likely to be a true TE deletion or a new TE insertion. While these classifications are not definitive, as there may be rare cases where a true TE deletion has spread through the population and becomes the common allele, it should correctly classify most TE variants. Overall, 72.3% of the TE absence variants identified with respect to the Col-0 reference genome were likely due to a true TE deletion in these accessions, while 4.8% were due to insertions in Col-0 not shared by most other accessions in the population (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). High allele frequency TE presence variants relative to Col-0, representing true deletions in Col-0, were much more rare, with 97.8% of initial TEPID TE presence calls being subsequently classified as true insertions. The rarity of true deletions identified in Col-0 is likely due to a reference bias in the TE variant identification method using short read data, as false negative presence calls in the population will reduce the number of true deletions identified in Col-0 due to a reduction in the allele frequency for that variant, causing the frequency of TE presence variants in non-Col-0 accessions to fall below the required 80% threshold for some variants. This is not expected to have a large impact on subsequent population-scale analyses, as Col-0 is only one accession out of the 216 analyzed. Accessions were found to contain on average\u00a0~240 true deletions and\u00a0~300 true insertions (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Overall, we identified 15,077 TE insertions, 5856 true TE deletions, and 2162 TE variants at a high MAF that were unable to be classified as an insertion or deletion (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 3</a>)."

This suggests that TE insertion positions are largely random but may be eliminated from chromosome arms through selection, and accumulate in the pericentromeric regions where low recombination rates prevent their removal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). TE deletions and common TE variants were found in similar chromosomal regions, as deletion variants represent the rare loss of common variants. Among TE deletions, DNA TEs were slightly less biased towards the centromeres in comparison to the distribution of RNA TEs (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The distribution of rare (&lt;3% minor allele frequency [MAF],\u00a0&lt;7 accessions; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) TE variants and TE insertions was similar to that observed for regions of the genome previously identified as being differentially methylated in all DNA methylation contexts (mCG, mCHG, mCHH) between the wild accessions (population C-DMRs) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, population CG-DMRs (differentially methylated in the mCG context) less frequently overlapped with all types of TE variants identified and instead closely followed the chromosomal distribution of genes. This was expected, as CG-DMRs are associated with gene bodies whereas C-DMRs are associated with TEs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, genes and DNase I hypersensitivity sites (putative regulatory regions) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sullivan et al., 2014</a>) rarely contained a TE variant, whereas\u00a0~20\u201335%% of gene flanking regions, pseudogenes, intergenic regions, and other TEs were found to contain a TE variant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This again suggests that TE insertions occur randomly across the genome, with deleterious insertions that occur in functional regions of the genome being subsequently removed through selection. TE deletions and common TE variants were enriched within the set of TE variants found in gene bodies, indicating that TE deletions within genes may be better tolerated than new TE insertions within genes (<a href=\"#fig2\"><a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a></a>). No significant enrichment was found for TE variants within the <i>KNOT ENGAGED ELEMENT (KEE)</i> regions, previously identified as regions that may act as a 'TE sink' (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grob et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). This may indicate that these regions do not act as a 'TE sink' as has been previously proposed, or that the 'TE sink' activity is restricted to very recent insertions, as the insertions we analysed in this population were likely older than those used in the <i>KEE</i> study (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grob et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "Among the identified TE variants, several TE superfamilies were over- or under-represented compared to the number expected by chance given the overall genomic frequency of different TE types (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In particular, both TE insertions and deletions in the RC/Helitron superfamily were less numerous than expected, with an 11.5% depletion of RC/Helitron elements in the set of TE variants. In contrast, TEs belonging to the LTR/Gypsy superfamily were more frequently deleted than expected, with a 17% enrichment in the set of TE deletions. This was unlikely to be due to a differing ability of the detection method to identify TE variants of different lengths, as the TE variants identified had a similar distribution of lengths as all Arabidopsis TEs annotated in the Col-0 reference genome (<a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). These enrichments suggest that the RC/Helitron TEs have been relatively dormant in recent evolutionary history, while the LTR/Gypsy TEs, which are highly enriched in the pericentromeric regions, are frequently lost from the Arabidopsis genome. At the family level, we observed similar patterns of TE variant enrichment or depletion (<a href=\"#fig2s9\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 9</a>;<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 4</a>). As certain TEs present in Col-0 have previously been genotyped in 47 different accessions, allele frequency data was available for some TEs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hollister and Gaut, 2007</a>), and we compared these previous allele frequency estimates with our estimates based on the short read data. We found a weakly positive\u00a0linear correlation (r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.3) between the previous allele frequency estimates for <i>Basho</i> family TEs and our allele frequency estimates, which may not be unexpected given the differing population sizes and TE variant detection methods used (<a href=\"#fig2s10\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 10</a>)."

In one of the three replicates subjected to high salinity stress conditions, we identified a single potential TE insertion in a sample following 10 generations of single-seed descent, while no TE variants were identified in any of the three control single-seed descent replicate sets. However, without experimental validation it remains unclear if this represents a true variant. Therefore, we conclude that TE variants may arise at a rate less than 1 insertion in 60 generations under laboratory conditions. Further experimental work will be required to precisely determine the rate of transposition in Arabidopsis."

This distinction is important, as studies aiming to link epigenetic diversity to genetic variants using only SNPs would fail to detect such a link caused by TE variants if the TE variants are not in LD with SNPs. We tested how frequently common TE variants (&gt;3% MAF; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) were linked to adjacent SNPs to determine when they would represent a previously unassessed source of genetic variation between accessions. SNPs that were previously identified between the accessions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>) were compared to the presence/absence of individual TE variants. For the common TE variants in the population, the nearest flanking 300 SNPs upstream and 300 SNPs downstream of the TE variant site were analyzed for local linkage disequilibrium (LD, r<sup>2</sup>; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). TE variants were classified as being either \u2018low\u2019, \u2018mid\u2019, or \u2018high\u2019 LD variants by comparing ranked r<sup>2</sup> values of TE variant to SNPs against the median ranked r<sup>2</sup> value for all between SNP comparisons (SNP-SNP) to account for regional variation in the extent of SNP-SNP LD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) due to recombination rate variation or selection (<a href=\"#bib18\">Horton et al., 2012</a>). The majority (61%) of common TE variants had low LD with nearby SNPs, and represent a source of genetic diversity not previously assessed by SNP-based genotype calling methods (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). 29% of TE variants displayed high levels of LD and are tagged by nearby SNPs, while only 10% had intermediate levels of LD. We observed a positive correlation between TE variant MAF and LD state, with variants of a high MAF more often classified as high-LD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). While the proportion of TE variants classified as high, mid, or low-LD was mostly the same for both TE insertions and TE deletions, TE variants with a high MAF (&gt;20%) that were unable to be classified as either true deletions or as new insertions had a much higher proportion of high-LD variants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This was consistent with the observation that the more common alleles were more often in a high-LD state. TE variants displayed a similar distribution over chromosome 1 regardless of linkage classification (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Overall, this analysis revealed an abundance of previously uncharacterized genetic variation that exists amongst Arabidopsis accessions caused by the presence or absence of TEs, and illustrates the importance of identifying TE variants alongside other genetic diversity such as SNPs."

While the steady state transcript abundance of most genes appeared to be unaffected by the presence of a TE, 168 genes displayed significant differences in transcript abundance linked with the presence of a TE variant, indicating a role for these variants in the local regulation of gene expression (1% false discovery rate;\u00a0&gt;2-fold change in transcript abundance; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). No functional category enrichments in this set of differentially expressed genes were identified. As rare TE variants may also be associated with a difference in transcript abundance, but were unable to be statistically tested due to their rarity, a burden test for enrichment of rare variants in the extremes of expression was performed (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zhao et al., 2016</a>). Briefly, this method counts the frequency of rare variants within each gene expression rank in the population, and aggregates this information over the entire population to determine whether an enrichment of rare variants exists within the gene expression extremes for the population. A strong enrichment for gene expression extremes was observed for TE variants in all gene features tested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). While TE variants in gene upstream regions showed a strong enrichment of both high and low gene expression ranks, TE variants in exons or gene downstream regions were more skewed towards low expression ranks than high ranks. Randomization of the accession names removed these enrichments completely (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and there was little difference between TE insertions and TE deletions in the gene expression rank enrichments found (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This rare variant analysis further indicates that TE variants may alter the transcript abundance of nearby genes, with TE variants in exons or gene downstream regions being mostly associated with gene downregulation, whereas TE variants in gene upstream regions appear to be associated with gene activation and gene repression equally often."

                                "text": "As both increases and decreases in transcript abundance of nearby genes were observed for TE variants within each gene feature, it appears to be difficult to predict the impact that a TE variant may have on nearby gene expression based on TE insertion position alone. Furthermore, gene-level transcript abundance measurements may fail to identify potential positional effects of TE variants upon transcription. To more closely examine changes in transcript abundance associated with TE variants among the accessions, we inspected a subset of TE variant sites and identified TE variants that appear to have an impact on transcriptional patterns beyond simply a change in total transcript abundance of a nearby gene. For example, the presence of a TE insertion within an exon of <i>AtRLP18</i> (AT2G15040) was associated with truncation of the transcripts at the TE insertion site in accessions possessing the TE variant, as well as silencing of a downstream gene encoding a leucine-rich repeat protein (AT2G15042) (<a href=\"#fig5\"><a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a></a>). Both genes had significantly lower transcript abundance in accessions containing the TE insertion (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a05.8 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>-10</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test). As four accessions that were predicted to contain the TE insertion within <i>AtRLP18</i> appeared to have the non-insertion RNA expression pattern (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), we performed additional PCR validations on two of these four accessions, as well as two accessions with truncated RNA expression. These validations showed that the accessions predicted to contain the TE insertion but also expressing <i>AtRLP18</i> were false positive calls (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, the false positive rate for this site (~3%) was still lower than our global estimate for TEPID. <i>AtRLP18</i> has been reported to be involved in bacterial resistance, with the disruption of this gene by T-DNA insertion mediated mutagenesis resulting in increased susceptibility to the bacterial plant pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). Examination of pathogen resistance phenotype data (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aranzana et al., 2005</a>) revealed that accessions containing the TE insertion in the <i>AtRLP18</i> exon were more often sensitive to infection by <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> transformed with <i>avrPpH3</i> genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This suggests that the accessions containing this TE insertion within <i>AtRLP18</i> may have an increased susceptibility to certain bacterial pathogens."

                                "text": "Some TE variants were also associated with increased expression of nearby genes. For example, the presence of a TE within the upstream region of a gene encoding a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein (AT2G01360) was associated with higher transcript abundance of this gene (<a href=\"#fig5\"><a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a></a>). Transcription appeared to begin at the TE insertion point, rather than the transcriptional start site of the gene (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Accessions containing the TE insertion had significantly higher AT2G01360 transcript abundance than the accessions without the TE insertion (p &lt; 1.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22127</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test). The apparent transcriptional activation, linked with the presence of a TE belonging to the <i>HELITRON1</i> family, indicates that this element may carry regulatory information that alters the expression of genes downstream of the TE insertion site. Importantly, this variant was classified as a low-LD TE insertion, as it is not in LD with surrounding SNPs, and therefore the associated changes in gene transcript abundance would not be linked to genetic differences between the accessions using only SNP data. This TE variant was also upstream of <i>QPT</i> (AT2G01350), involved in NAD biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Katoh et al., 2006</a>), which did not show alterations in transcript abundance associated with the presence of the TE insertion, indicating a potential directionality of regulatory elements carried by the TE (<a href=\"#fig5\"><a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a></a>). This TE insertion occurred at the border of a non-syntenic block of genes thought to be a result of a transposition event in Arabidopsis\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Freeling et al., 2008</a>). This transposition event likely predates the TE insertion discovered here, and it is interesting that multiple transposition events appear to have occurred in close proximity in the genome. Overall, these examples demonstrate that TE variants can have unpredictable, yet important, effects on the expression of nearby genes, and these effects may be missed by studies focused on genetic variation at the level of SNPs."

TE variants were often physically close to DMRs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Furthermore, C-DMRs were more often close to a TE variant than expected, whereas CG-DMRs were rarely close to TE insertions or TE deletions (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Again, this was expected as DNA methylation solely in the CG context is associated with gene bodies, whereas DNA methylation in all contexts is associated with TEs. Overall, 54% of the 13,482 previously reported population C-DMRs were located within 1 kb of a TE variant (predominantly TE insertions), while only 15% of CG-DMRs were within 1 kb of a TE variant (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). For C-DMRs, this was significantly more than expected by chance, while it was significantly less than expected for CG-DMRs (p &lt; 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22124</sup>, determined by resampling 10,000 times). Of the C-DMRs that were not close to a TE variant, 3701 (27% of all C-DMRs) were within 1 kb of a non-variable TE. Thus, 81% of C-DMRs are within 1 kb of a TE when considering both fixed and variable TEs in the population. Of the remaining 19% of C-DMRs, most were found in genes or intergenic regions."

Further analysis showed that for C-DMRs the strength of this association was dependent on the distance from the C-DMR to the TE insertion, whereas this was not true for CG-DMRs or TE deletions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggested a distance-dependent effect of TE insertion on C-DMR methylation. DNA methylation levels at C-DMRs located within 1 kb of a TE insertion (TE-DMRs) were more often positively correlated with the presence of a TE insertion than the DNA methylation levels at C-DMRs further than 1 kb from a TE insertion (non-TE-DMRs). This was evident from the distribution of correlation coefficients for non-TE-DMRs being centred around zero, whereas for TE-DMRs this distribution was skewed to the right (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <i>D</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.24). For TE deletions, such a difference was not observed in the distributions of correlation coefficients between TE-DMRs and non-TE-DMRs, nor for CG-DMRs and their nearby TE insertions or deletions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <i>D</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.07\u20130.10).

To determine the effect that these rare TE variants may have on DMR methylation levels, a burden test for enrichment of DMR methylation extremes at TE-DMRs was performed, similar to the analysis undertaken to test the effect of rare variants on gene expression. A strong enrichment was observed for high C-DMR and CG-DMR methylation level ranks for TE insertions, while TE deletions were associated with both high and low extremes of DNA methylation levels at C-DMRs, and less so at CG-DMRs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This further indicates that the presence of a TE insertion is associated with higher C-DMR methylation levels, while TE deletions appear to have more variable effects on DMR methylation levels. This enrichment was completely absent after repeating the analysis with randomized accession names (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A slight enrichment was also observed for low DMR methylation ranks for TE insertions near CG-DMRs, indicating that the insertion of a TE was sometimes associated with reduced CG methylation in nearby regions (&lt;1 kb from the TE). Closer examination of these TE insertions revealed that some TE insertions were associated with decreased transcript abundance of nearby genes, with a corresponding loss of gene body methylation, offering a potential explanation for the decreased CG methylation observed near some TE insertions (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

While DNA methylation levels around pericentromeric TE insertions and deletions (&lt;3 Mb from a centromere) seemed to be unaffected by the presence of a TE insertion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), TE insertions in the chromosome arms were associated with an increase in DNA methylation levels in all sequence contexts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). In contrast, TE deletions in the chromosome arms did not affect patterns of DNA methylation, as the flanking methylation level in all contexts appeared to remain high following deletion of the TE (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>). As the change in DNA methylation levels around most TE variant sites appeared to be restricted to regions\u00a0&lt;200 bp from the insertion site, DNA methylation levels in 200 bp regions flanking TE variants were correlated with the presence/absence of TE variants. DNA methylation levels were often positively correlated with the presence of a TE insertion when the insertion was distant from a centromere (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). TE deletions were more variably correlated with local DNA methylation levels, but also showed a bias towards positive correlations for TE deletions distant from the centromeres. However, for TE variants in the chromosome arms the mean correlation between TE insertions and flanking DNA methylation was significantly higher than the mean correlation between TE deletions and flanking DNA methylation (Mann-Whitney U test, p&lt;0.002). As methylome data were available for both leaf and bud tissue for 12 accessions, this analysis was repeated comparing between tissue types, but no differences were observed in the patterns of methylation surrounding TE variant sites between the two tissues (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that the effect of TE variants upon patterns of DNA methylation may be tissue-independent."

TE insertions appear to be important in defining local patterns of DNA methylation, while DNA methylation levels often remain elevated following a TE deletion, and so are independent from the presence or absence of TEs in these cases. Importantly, the distance from a TE insertion to the centromere appears to have a strong impact on whether an alteration of local DNA methylation patterns will occur. This is likely due to flanking sequences being highly methylated in the pericentromeric regions, and so the insertion of a TE cannot further increase levels of DNA methylation. Overall, a large fraction of the population C-DMRs previously identified between wild accessions are correlated with the presence of local TE variants. CG-DMR methylation levels appear to be mostly independent from the presence/absence of common TE variants, while rare TE variants have an impact on DNA methylation levels at both C-DMRs and CG-DMRs, perhaps due to their more frequent occurrence within the chromosome arms, closer to genes and where CG-DMRs are more abundant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

To test the significance of each pairwise correlation, bootstrap p-value estimates were collected based on 500 permutations of accession labels. TE-DMR associations were deemed significant if they had an association more extreme than all 500 permutations (p&lt;1/500). A band of significant associations was observed for TE insertions and their nearby C-DMRs, signifying a local association between TE insertion presence/absence and C-DMR methylation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This local association was not as strong for TE deletions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), consistent with our above findings. While TE variants and DNA methylation showed a local association, it is also possible that TE variation may influence DNA methylation states more broadly in the genome, perhaps through the\u00a0production of <i>trans-</i>acting smRNAs or inactivation of genes involved in DNA methylation establishment or maintenance. To identify any potential enrichment of C-DMRs regulated in trans, the total number of significant associations was summed for each TE variant across the whole genome (<a href=\"#fig8\"><a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a></a>, top panels). At many sites, far more significant associations were found than expected due to the false positive rate alone. This suggested the existence of many putative <i>trans</i> associations between TE variants and genome-wide C-DMR methylation levels. These C-DMRs that appeared to be associated with a TE insertion in <i>trans</i> were further examined, checking for TE insertions near these C-DMRs that were present in the same accessions as the <i>trans</i> associated TE, as these could lead to a false <i>trans</i> association. These were extremely rare, with only four such cases for TE insertions, and 38 cases for TE deletions, and so were unable to explain the high degree of <i>trans</i> associations found. Overall, this suggests that certain TE variants may affect DNA methylation levels more broadly in the genome, as their effects upon DNA methylation are not necessarily limited to nearby DNA sequences."

Most TE variants were due to the de novo insertion of TEs, while a smaller subset was likely due to the deletion of ancestral TE copies, mostly around the pericentromeric regions. A subset (32%) of TE variants with a minor allele frequency above 3% were able to be tested for linkage with nearby SNPs. The majority of these TE variants exhibited only low levels of LD with nearby SNPs, indicating that they represent genetic variants currently overlooked in genomic studies. A marked depletion of TE variants within gene bodies and DNase I hypersensitivity sites (putative regulatory regions) is consistent with the more deleterious TE insertions being removed from the population through selection. Of those TE variants found in gene bodies, TE deletions were overrepresented, indicating that the loss of ancestral TEs inserted within genes may be more frequent, or perhaps less deleterious, than the de novo insertion of TEs into genes."

In one case, these changes in gene expression could be linked with phenotypic changes, with accessions containing a TE insertion more frequently sensitive to bacterial infection. Further experiments will be needed to establish a causal link between this TE insertion and the associated phenotype. An analysis of rare TE variants, present at a low MAF, further strengthened this relationship between TE presence/absence and altered transcript abundance, as a strong enrichment of rare TE variants in accessions with extreme gene expression ranks in the population was identified. Therefore, the effects of TE insertions appear to be long-lasting, as there was little difference between common (old) and rare (young) variants in the impact upon gene expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Thus, the frequency of pure epialleles, independent of underlying genetic variation, may be even more rare than previously anticipated (<a href=\"#bib36\">Richards, 2006</a>). Overall, 81% of all C-DMRs were within 1 kb of a TE, when considering both fixed and variable TEs in the population. We did not find evidence of CG-DMR methylation, associated with gene bodies, being altered by the presence of common TE variants. However, rare TE variants may be more important in shaping patterns of DNA methylation at some CG-DMRs, perhaps due to their higher frequency in regions close to genes. The level of local DNA methylation changes associated with TE variants was also related to the distance from a TE variant to the centromere, with variants in the chromosome arms being more strongly correlated with DNA methylation levels. This seems to be due to a higher baseline level of DNA methylation at the pericentromeric regions, which prevent any further increase in DNA methylation level following insertion of a TE. Furthermore, we found an important distinction between TE insertions and TE deletions in the effect that these variants have on nearby DNA methylation levels. While flanking DNA methylation levels increase following a TE insertion, the deletion of an ancestral TE was often not associated with a corresponding decrease in flanking DNA methylation levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This indicates that high levels of DNA methylation, once established, may be maintained in the absence of the TE insertion that presumably triggered the original change in DNA methylation level. It is then possible that TE variants explain more of the inter-accession variation in DNA methylation patterns than we find direct evidence for, if some C-DMRs were formed by the insertion of an ancestral TE that is now absent in all the accessions analysed here. These DMRs would then represent the epigenetic 'scars' of past TE insertions."

The identification of some TE variants that appeared to be associated with changes in DNA methylation levels at multiple loci throughout the genome indicates a\u00a0possible <i>trans</i> regulation of DNA methylation state linked to specific TE variants. Further experiments will be required to confirm and examine the role of these TE variants in determining genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation. Overall, our results show that TE presence/absence variants between wild Arabidopsis accessions not only have important effects on nearby gene expression, but can also have a role in determining local patterns of DNA methylation, and explain many regions of differential DNA methylation previously observed in the population."

Only insertions and absence variants that were variable in at least two of the fourteen accessions selected to be genotyped were considered. For insertion sites, primers were designed to span the predicted TE insertion site. For TE absence sites, two primer sets were designed; one primer set to span the TE, and another primer set with one primer annealing within the TE sequence predicted to be absent, and the other primer annealing in the flanking sequence (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

We then grouped accessions based on TE presence/absence variants, and performed a Mann-Whitney U test to determine differences in RNA transcript abundance levels between the groups. We used q-value estimation to correct for multiple testing, using the R qvalue package v2.2.2 with the following parameters: lambda = seq(0, 0.6, 0.05), smooth.df=4 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</a>).

For each rare TE variant near a gene or DMR, we ranked the gene expression level or DMR DNA methylation level for all accessions in the population, and tallied the ranks of accessions containing a rare variant.

This paper persuasively argues that TE variation is the genetic basis for most DNA methylation polymorphisms and makes an important contribution to our understanding of the genomic impacts of TEs. However, the reviewers raised several points that should be addressed before publication. Most generally, this manuscript focuses a bit too much on the process and not enough on the biology. Dense statistical descriptions that will be difficult to understand for most readers are common, yet some results are explained either very broadly or not at all, and some important biological issues are ignored. A greater emphasis on biological meaning would substantially improve this paper."

However, the overall number of insertions identified was 15,007 vs. 8,088 deletions. The reason that more deletions than insertions were identified per ecotype but fewer overall is that some of the deletions are present in nearly all or all tested ecotypes. Because this analysis is relative \u2013 insertions are both insertions in other ecotypes and deletions in Col, whereas deletions are deletions in other ecotypes and insertions in Col, such 'fixed deletions' are just insertion in Col. The authors get to this issue later in the analysis, but they don't explain the asymmetry. Why aren't there 'fixed insertions' relative to Col \u2013 meaning deletion in Col? Is TEPID unable to identify such events, or is there a biological meaning to this? An explanation would be very helpful."

Can the common/rare definition either be added to the <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> legend, or introduced when polarization is described? Similarly, it seems that the translation of MAF cutoffs to numbers of individuals are not consistent throughout the paper. While the definition of MAF cutoff states this is in &gt;7 accessions, this doesn't obviously make sense with 217 accessions (shouldn't it be &gt;=7?). Also, it seems that filtering reduces the number of accessions to 184, where 3% would be &gt;5.

A more appropriate estimate of TE insertion age may be through measurement of allele frequency. Because estimated TE age is used in analyses throughout the manuscript, a robust measure is essential."

The correlations with TEs demethylated (more accurately hypomethylated) in the CHH context in sperm ignore the global nature of this phenomenon, which affects most heterochromatic TEs. The small RNA analysis rests on the unwarranted assumption that the small RNAs are produced in the endosperm. The paper from which the small RNA data are derived makes a strong case that the small RNAs are derived from the maternal seed coat, which would provide a trivial explanation for the observation that TEs absent in the maternal genome have lower levels of small RNA in hybrid seeds.

Calling TE polymorphisms from short-read data is not trivial. What is done here is sensible, but I would still like to have some idea of error rates and biases. Using simulations (subsection \u201cComputational identification of TE presence/absence variation\u201d) is not QC \u2013 it is at best debugging of software. What is needed is comparison with real data, preferably a \"gold standard\". The obvious choice is the PacBio L<i>er</i> assembly, and it is used here, but it seems to me it is used in the wrong direction. The TE polymorphisms identified in the short-read data are confirmed in the PacBio data, rather than the other way around. It is the usual false-positive / false-negative issue that plagues all these data. What is done shows that the identified polymorphism are reliable, but it tells us nothing about what we don't see. Which leads to biases of all kinds. Why not do the right thing? And if there is a good reason for not doing the right thing, please justify this, and say a few words about how why the inevitable biases do not affect your results."

Take LD first. It is theoretically impossible for TEs variants to show a different LD behavior than SNPs unless they are due to repeat mutations (which have to be very frequent indeed to affect LD). As long as identity in state = identity by descent, it doesn't matter how mutations arise. Of course it is possible that some of the TE indels could be non-unique, but there is no evidence for this in this paper (you could look for it: does the same insertion occur on unrelated haplotypes?). I'm fairly convinced that the difference is r<sup>2</sup> distributions you see are largely due to differences in the allele frequency. To confirm this, compare r<sup>2</sup> between TEs and flanking SNPs to r<sup>2</sup> between a SNP and flanking SNPs after making sure that the polymorphism being tested has the same derived allele frequency. This can be done by binning. I think you will see that there is no difference. And if you do see a difference, it is probably due to some other artifact (genotyping error?), because, as I said, it is theoretically impossible for there to be a difference (unless repeat mutations are very different, selection is strong, etc.)."

They verified efficiency and accuracy of the TEPID and estimated ages of transposons based on linkage disequilibrium between transposon and flanking sequences. In addition, they assessed the degree of transposon derived regulation of transcription of the neighbouring genes, which turned out to be surprisingly limited and only two experimentally verified examples could illustrate TE derived transcriptional suppression or activation. Interestingly, suppression of transcription of a gene encoding a LRR protein seems to cause a change in the level of resistance to a bacterial pathogen when accessions with or without the transposon insertion were compared. The authors also studied the influence of transposon insertions on the local variation in DNA methylation claiming that especially old insertions affect variation in DNA methylation. Finally, in reciprocal inter-accession crosses they examined the epigenetic interaction between accessions differing in the distribution of particular transposable elements, comparing loci with presence of corresponding transposons in one or both accessions."

This paper persuasively argues that TE variation is the genetic basis for most DNA methylation polymorphisms and makes an important contribution to our understanding of the genomic impacts of TEs. However, the reviewers raised several points that should be addressed before publication. Most generally, this manuscript focuses a bit too much on the process and not enough on the biology. Dense statistical descriptions that will be difficult to understand for most readers are common, yet some results are explained either very broadly or not at all, and some important biological issues are ignored. A greater emphasis on biological meaning would substantially improve this paper.</i>"

Using simulations (subsection \u201cComputational identification of TE presence/absence variation\u201d) is not QC \u2013 it is at best debugging of software. What is needed is comparison with real data, preferably a \"gold standard\". The obvious choice is the PacBio Ler assembly, and it is used here, but it seems to me it is used in the wrong direction. The TE polymorphisms identified in the short-read data are confirmed in the PacBio data, rather than the other way around. It is the usual false-positive / false-negative issue that plagues all these data. What is done shows that the identified polymorphism are reliable, but it tells us nothing about what we don't see. Which leads to biases of all kinds. Why not do the right thing? And if there is a good reason for not doing the right thing, please justify this, and say a few words about how why the inevitable biases do not affect your results.</i>"

Take LD first. It is theoretically impossible for TEs variants to show a different LD behavior than SNPs unless they are due to repeat mutations (which have to be very frequent indeed to affect LD). As long as identity in state = identity by descent, it doesn't matter how mutations arise. Of course it is possible that some of the TE indels could be non-unique, but there is no evidence for this in this paper (you could look for it: does the same insertion occur on unrelated haplotypes?). I'm fairly convinced that the difference is r<sup>2</sup> distributions you see are largely due to differences in the allele frequency. To confirm this, compare r<sup>2</sup> between TEs and flanking SNPs to r<sup>2</sup> between a SNP and flanking SNPs after making sure that the polymorphism being tested has the same derived allele frequency. This can be done by binning. I think you will see that there is no difference. And if you do see a difference, it is probably due to some other artifact (genotyping error?), because, as I said, it is theoretically impossible for there to be a difference (unless repeat mutations are very different, selection is strong, etc.).</i>"

One example of this is the TE insertion that we identify in <i>AtRLP18</i>, which is untagged by SNPs, and so the differing sensitivities of accessions to <i>Pseudomonas</i> infection would appear random in the absence of our TE variant data. We also include a comparison between LD state and minor allele frequency, and we see that the two are indeed well correlated, indicating that our TE variant data is likely free of bias."

Rather than carrying out a SNP-by-SNP test, which clearly doesn't work when frequencies are less than 3% (is that 2 alleles?), ask whether these rare TEs are, in aggregate, more likely to show extreme phenotypes than two (or three, or whatever the right number is) randomly chosen individuals?

However, one of our key findings is that the level of DNA methylation surrounding TEs often remains high following a TE deletion, suggesting that DNA methylation, once established near a TE, often remains after the TE has been deleted. This suggests that more CDMRs could be a result of TE insertions than we find direct evidence for, if these TEs were deleted in all accessions analysed in this population.
