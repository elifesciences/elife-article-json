We investigated the neurochemical underpinnings of this process. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy in humans, to measure levels of glutamate and GABA in dACC. We examined their relationship to neural signals in dACC, measured with fMRI, and cognitive task performance. Both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters in dACC were predictive of the strength of neural signals in dACC and behavioral adaptation. Glutamate levels were correlated, first, with stronger neural activity representing information to be learnt about the tasks\u2019 costs and benefits and, second, greater use of this information in the guidance of behavior. GABA levels were negatively correlated with the same neural signals and the same indices of behavioral influence. Our results suggest that glutamate and GABA in dACC affect the encoding and use of past experiences to guide behavior."

We investigated the neurochemical underpinnings of this process. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy in humans, to measure levels of glutamate and GABA in dACC. We examined their relationship to neural signals in dACC, measured with fMRI, and cognitive task performance. Both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters in dACC were predictive of the strength of neural signals in dACC and behavioral adaptation. Glutamate levels were correlated, first, with stronger neural activity representing information to be learnt about the tasks\u2019 costs and benefits and, second, greater use of this information in the guidance of behavior. GABA levels were negatively correlated with the same neural signals and the same indices of behavioral influence. Our results suggest that glutamate and GABA in dACC affect the encoding and use of past experiences to guide behavior."

Most of our knowledge of dACC is based on measurements tied to neuronal firing such as human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and animal recording studies or to investigations of loss of function after lesions and inactivation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kennerley et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amiez et al., 2006</a>).

For example ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been linked to value-guided decisions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boorman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Rushworth et al., 2011</a>). Biophysical neural network models of decision-making in vmPFC (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hunt et al., 2012</a>) predict that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediates the dynamics of the value comparison process. The predictions were born out in a study looking at the neurochemistry of this structure with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jocham et al., 2012</a>). Relatedly, levels of GABA in motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stagg et al., 2011</a>) and in the frontal eye field (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sumner et al., 2010</a>) have been found to predict the speed of selection of responses and inhibition of incorrect responses to distractors respectively. In all three cases, neurotransmitter levels were predictive of the dynamics of the decision or selection process within different domains."

More specifically, we hypothesized that if excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in dACC determine the processing and use of information to form a model of the world (<a href=\"#bib33\">O'Reilly et al., 2013</a>), or at least the task at hand, then measures of these neurotransmitters should relate to both behavioral and neural markers of this process (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The reward probabilities changed randomly from trial to trial and were displayed to participants on each trial on the screen.

The overall value is based on a combination of learnt value (reward and effort magnitudes) and cued value (probabilities). How much they take learnt value, i.e. past reinforcement and effort, into account when making decisions is captured by a single factor, \u03b3. (<b>B</b>) As dACC has previously been linked to both learning about rewards and effort we measured neurotransmitter levels in this region. We propose that the excitation-inhibition balance in dACC affects the use of learnt information relating to both reward and effort in the following way: dACC has a representation of the learnt information, maybe in the\u00a0form of a model (<a href=\"#bib18\">Karlsson et al., 2012</a>). When there is more overall excitation in this circuit (in red), then dACC representations of value history are more active, ensuring effective distribution of such information to other circuits, ultimately leading to more impact of this factor in behavior. In contrast, when there is relatively more inhibition in dACC, dissemination from dACC is reduced, minimizing the impact of learnt information on other brain areas and on behavior."

The models also differed in whether reward magnitude and probability were integrated as a weighted linear sum (M1-M3) or whether they were multiplied with each other (M4-M6). Model fit was assessed using either BIC (grey) on a non-hierarchical version of the models or using half-split cross validation (2*negative log likelihood, black, using data from the session only inside or outside the scanner to fit the model and the remaining session as test set) on the hierarchical models. Lower values indicate better fit. On both measures, models using linear integration of magnitude and probability (M1-M3) provided an overwhelmingly better fit, as found previously (<a href=\"#bib37\">Scholl et al., 2014</a>). While the model fit measures do not agree on whether modeling learning with a shared or separate learning rates (\u03b1) is best (M1 vs. M2), we note that for the key parameter of interest here, the use of learnt information (\u03b3), we obtain the same value using either model (r\u00a0=\u00a01.0, p&lt;10<sup>\u221236</sup>). We have therefore used the simpler model (M1) throughout. We also note that the excellent model fit for M3 shows that the Bayesian optimal observer model that we used to generate regressors for the fMRI and behavioral regression analysis provides a good fit to the data. (<b>B</b>) Correlations between model parameters derived from M1 (hierarchical version). Importantly, the use of learnt information (\u03b3,\u00a0top\u00a0row) did not correlate significantly with any other model parameter (all r\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.14; all p&gt;0.43).\u00a0**p&lt;0.01. (<b>C</b>) Model parameter estimates for each participant derived either from the behavior measured inside the MRI scanner or on the next day outside the MRI scanner showed high correlations, in particularly for the use of learnt information (r\u00a0=\u00a00.59, p=0.0012). This shows that our model-derived measurements have high test-retest reliability. Data in Figure2_SourceData3.xlsx"

We included the following parametric regressors in the decision phase: the reward probabilities that were shown on the screen, the predicted reward and effort magnitudes (derived from a Bayesian learning model; we note that the regressors for reward and effort magnitudes obtained in this way correlated very strongly (r&gt;0.99) with those obtained from the fitted reinforcement learning model). These regressors were included separately for the chosen and unchosen option. We also included a regressor indicating whether reward had been real or hypothetical on the last trial [because rewards were probabilistic they were only delivered on some trials (real reward trials) while on other trials participants were just informed what the reward would have been had it been delivered (hypothetical reward)]. In the outcome phase, we included the following parametric regressors: whether the reward delivered for the chosen option was real or hypothetical, the reward probability for the chosen option and the reward and effort magnitude outcomes for the chosen and the unchosen options. The onset of all regressors for the chosen option was time-locked to the onset of the outcome phase; the onset and duration of the regressors for the unchosen option were timelocked to their display. In the effort exertion phase, we included the clicking rate as a parametric regressor.

To test this, we first identified brain areas that represented the information to be learnt (GLM1) at the time of learning.

In our paradigm, it was always advantageous to use information learnt from the outcome of one decision to guide subsequent decisions. In contrast, in other situations, it may be beneficial to behave more randomly (for example when exploring new environments). Here, increased GABA concentrations might enable better performance by ensuring that one does not rely too much on previous information. In fact, inhibition in ACC of rats has been shown to disable reward history-guided behaviors, making them more random, which depending on the task led to better or worse performance, similarly inactivation of dACC in macaques completely prevented them from using reward history (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kennerley et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amiez et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Karlsson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tervo et al., 2014</a>).

The probability of each option was shown on the screen at the time of choice. In contrast, the reward and effort magnitudes of the options were not explicitly instructed and instead participants had to learn and track these slowly changing features of the two choices across trials. These magnitudes were drawn from normal distributions of which the means fluctuated pseudorandomly, slowly and independently over the course of the experiment between three levels (low, mid, high). Participants were instructed to learn and keep track of the changing mean value of each magnitude across the experiment. Only one of the reward or effort magnitude means was drifting at any one time and each of the four magnitudes was at each mean level equally often."

To make the task more effortful a random jitter (five pixels, the\u00a0total screen size was 1280\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0800 pixels) was added to the mouse movement and circles only had a 70% probability of disappearing when clicked on.

Each participant performed the same two schedules in randomized order. Participants were informed about the features of the task in two training sessions before the scan, including the fixed number of trials they would perform. This ensured that they did not perceive low effort options as having a potentially higher monetary value because taking them might allow participants to move on to the next trial more quickly and to perform more trials with more chances to win money. Further details of the training were as follows: In the first training session (45 min), participants performed a version of the task without a learning component, i.e. not only the probability, but also reward and effort magnitudes were explicitly shown. This training ensured that participants were familiar with the features of the task, for example, that they understood what the probability information meant. We also used this session to exclude participants before the fMRI session that did not find the effort sufficiently aversive to produce robust effects on behavior. In a second training session (1 hr), we instructed participants about the learning task that they later performed in the fMRI scanner. At the end of the training, participants were queried about how they made decisions (specifically, they were asked \u2018What are you thinking about when you\u2019re making your decision\u2019). All participants reported trying to learn the reward and effort magnitudes and using the explicitly cued probabilities to make decisions. This suggested that participants were well aware of how to do the task before the beginning of the scan."

Previous studies have shown that spectroscopy measurements of neurotransmitter levels are region specific (<a href=\"#bib7\">Emir et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">van der Veen and Shen, 2013</a>). First, a high-resolution T1-weighted scan was acquired using an MPRAGE sequence. Based on this scan, the spectroscopy voxel (2\u00a0x\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 cm) was centered on dACC by reference to the location of the corpus callosum, the cingulate and adjacent sulci. The center of gravity of the region of maximum voxel overlap across participants lay at x\u00a0=\u00a00, y\u00a0=\u00a028, z\u00a0=\u00a028 in the\u00a0Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The relatively large size of the spectroscopy voxel meant that it extended to include tissue in the paracingulate sulcus in those participants in which it was present. MRS data (128 samples) were acquired using the SPECIAL sequence (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mekle et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mlyn\u00e1rik et al., 2006</a>) as described previously (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stagg et al., 2011</a>). The\u00a0data were preprocessed using the FID-Appliance (github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A [<a href=\"#bib40\">Simpson et al., 2015</a>]) to correct for frequency and phase-drift. The data were then analyzed using LCModel (<a href=\"#bib34\">Provencher, 2001</a>). Voxels for which Cramer-Rao lower bound values exceeded 20% were excluded. GABA and glutamate values were divided by total creatine. To correct for partial volumes within the spectroscopy voxels, all analyses included as confound regressors the relative volumes of grey and white matter (i.e. grey or white matter divided by total tissue = grey + white + cerebrospinal fluid) and total tissue in the spectroscopy voxel. These values were obtained using FAST (FMRIB\u2019s automated segmentation tool, [<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2001</a>]). The results were independent of the precise manner of controlling for partial volume (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Therefore, to be able to measure the separate impact of glutamate and GABA on the use of the learnt information, we performed nonparametric (Spearman) partial correlations, between the use of learnt information (\u03b3) and either glutamate or GABA, controlling for the other neurotransmitter. In each analysis, we additionally controlled for group assignment, inverse temperature (\u03b2, from the behavioral model), relative gray and white matter and total tissue. To reduce the number of multiple comparisons in our initial analysis, when testing each model parameter for its relationship to glutamate and GABA, we combined glutamate and GABA to one value (glutamate minus GABA). This also reflected our initial hypothesis that it might not be each neurotransmitter in isolation that influences neural activity and behavior but rather the relationship between glutamate and GABA that is critical."

We used the standard settings in FSL (<a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2004</a>) for image pre-processing and analysis. Motion was corrected using the FSL tool MCFLIRT (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jenkinson et al., 2002</a>). This also provided six motion regressors that we included in the FMRI analyses. Functional images were first spatially smoothed (Gaussian kernel with 5 mm full-width half-maximum) and temporally high-pass filtered (3 dB cut-off of 100\u00a0s). Afterward, the functional data were manually denoised using probabilistic independent component analysis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beckmann and Smith, 2004</a>), visually identifying and regressing out obvious noise components (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kelly et al., 2010</a>); we considered only the first 40 components of each participant which had the greatest impact to interfere with task data (total up to 550). We used the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) from FSL (<a href=\"#bib42\">Smith, 2002</a>) on the high-resolution structural MRI images to separate brain matter from non-brain matter. The resulting images guided registration of functional images in the\u00a0Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-space using non-linear registrations as implemented in FNIRT (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jenkinson et al., 2012</a>).

They first made these measures in the rostral part of the mid-cingulate cortex, taking into account sulcal morphology. The defined ROI in the region served for spectroscopic measurements and for comparisons with BOLD measurements obtained while subjects performed a multidimensional learning task. The task tested the degree to which the subjects used outcome information to adapt decisions to choose between alternatives. A model-based approach, validated by models comparisons, allowed the authors to fit subjects' behavior and extract a parameter of interest describing the tendency of subjects to use learnt information."

In addition, this study replicated previous work with the multidimensional learning task, thereby strengthening the notion that dACC mediates updating of cognitive models used to drive adaptive reward-guided behavior."

Specifically, to reduce the number of comparisons, we have combined the glutamate and GABA measurement (as z-score normalized glutamate minus GABA levels, as for the fMRI) and performed partial correlations between this value and the four behavioral parameters (use of learnt information, inverse temperature, relative reliance on learnt reward or effort information and learning rate). These four comparisons thus have a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 0.0125 (0.05/4). Furthermore, all these results are now reported as nonparametric partial correlations (Spearman\u2019s rho, \u03c1; this has also been implemented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> in the main manuscript).

For example, Kurniawan et al. (2013), Prevost et al. (2010) and Skvortsova et al. (2014) have all reported that dACC activity increases with increasing effort levels and decreases with increased levels of reward, which results in a signal that reports the opposite/inverse of the subjective value of the chosen option. Such a signal can, for the sake of brevity, be described as a \u201cdeactivation\u201d in proportion to subjective value of the choice taken as opposed to the choice not taken. However, we agree with the reviewers that such a description is potentially confusing and arguably the activity pattern becomes more intuitive if it is described as positively related to the value of the alternative choice rather than the choice taken. Because the values of the two choices are varied independently we know that the activity is definitely also positively related to the value of the unchosen option. A number of fMRI and single neuron recording studies have suggested that such activity in dACC is related to the weighing up of evidence for changing or maintaining behavior (Kolling et al., 2012; Kolling et al., 2014; Kolling et al., 2016a; Kolling et al., 2016b; Meder et al., 2016; O'Reilly et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2015; Shima and Tanji, 1998; Stoll et al., 2016; Wittmann et al., 2016).

In the revised manuscript we have tried to express this without using the word \u201cdeactivation\u201d which carries entirely inappropriate connotations of an overall decrement in activity during task performance. To take this to the domain of neurotransmitters, an enhanced learning signal in dACC would mean a stronger signal indicating the relative value of information to be learnt for an alternative as opposed to the current behavior. If glutamate increases a signal and GABA decreases it then we should see a larger instance of such a signal as glutamate increases and as GABA decreases. This is exactly what we find."

In order to perform the most stringent control analysis, we chose control areas, which were identified as having activity levels that changed in the same manner and direction as dACC in the same contrast (information to be learnt). However, we agree with the reviewer that we could have also examined activity in areas that showed the opposite pattern of activity in relation to our contrast of interest (i.e. the areas listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1B</a>). We have now performed this additional control analysis, identifying regions of interest in mid cingulate cortex and temporal cortex, extending into parietal cortex.

More excitation could drive increased firing of neurons with reward history based estimates of value, leading behavior to be more influenced by reward histories. GABA on the other hand reduces firing, preventing such information from driving behavior and effectively suppressing the effect of such past experiences on choice."

In other words it reduced the influence of the rats\u2019 task models on their behavior. In the study of Tervo and colleagues, however, not using learnt information meant animals behaved randomly, whereas in our task they relied more heavily on other features of the task, namely the non-learnt probability information in a trial."
