And can we identify whether infection risks have changed by country or region?

For these reasons, trying to get a clear picture of the scale of the malaria problem in Africa is a major challenge. Noor and colleagues chose to measure malaria by the most accurate method available, which involved looking for studies that had actually identified <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites in the blood. Their final analysis draws on data collected from 3.5 million individuals from over 26,000 surveys spanning 49 regions of Africa, with each piece of information linked to its precise geographic origin by satellite technology."

Each piece of information was adjusted to account for when and where it was collected, and the data were then standardized to work out the rate of infection in the age group of interest\u2014the highly vulnerable population of children aged 2\u201310 years. They also factored in a host of complex influences on malaria transmission, such as urbanisation and climate. The final output was a measure of malaria risk for each individual square kilometre of Africa, first in 2000 and again a decade later. Each of these tiny squares was then classified into one of eight different malaria risk categories."

They also found an overall reduction in malaria transmission in 40 of the 44 countries that they assessed in detail. Moreover, four territories\u2014South Africa, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Cape Verde\u2014had successfully reduced malaria into the lowest risk category by 2010. By this time, the majority of the transmission in the highest risk category was occurring in just ten countries."

Rates of infection have also remained unchanged or have increased in some countries between 2000 and 2010: Malawi and South Sudan are highlighted as areas for increasing concern, and high transmission has continued across many parts of Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo."

Despite a data collection effort that spanned eight years, they were still unable to find enough information to assess the malaria risk for certain regions of Africa. Moreover, the vastly complex nature of malaria transmission cannot be completely captured or measured by a computer-based method. Overall, however, the results of this analysis provide valuable feedback for organizations trying to improve population health in many parts of Africa."

The detailed maps they have produced also highlight how the risks of an infection can wax and wane, reminding us of the need to constantly re-assess the best way to keep pace with changing patterns of disease. Noor and colleagues conclude with cautious optimism about the progress made since 2000, but provide a timely warning that the challenge of malaria is far from over."
