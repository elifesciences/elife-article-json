Studying how individual decisions unfold requires moment-by-moment readouts of brain state. Here we provide such a view from dorsal premotor and primary motor cortex. Two monkeys performed a novel decision task while we recorded from many neurons simultaneously. We found that a decoder trained using \u2018forced choices\u2019 (one target viable) was highly reliable when applied to \u2018free choices\u2019. However, during free choices internal events formed three categories. Typically, neural activity was consistent with rapid, unwavering choices. Sometimes, though, we observed presumed \u2018changes of mind\u2019: the neural state initially reflected one choice before changing to reflect the final choice. Finally, we observed momentary \u2018indecision\u2019: delay forming any clear motor plan. Further, moments of neural indecision accompanied moments of behavioral indecision. Together, these results reveal the rich and diverse set of internal events long suspected to occur during free choice."

Studying how individual decisions unfold requires moment-by-moment readouts of brain state. Here we provide such a view from dorsal premotor and primary motor cortex. Two monkeys performed a novel decision task while we recorded from many neurons simultaneously. We found that a decoder trained using \u2018forced choices\u2019 (one target viable) was highly reliable when applied to \u2018free choices\u2019. However, during free choices internal events formed three categories. Typically, neural activity was consistent with rapid, unwavering choices. Sometimes, though, we observed presumed \u2018changes of mind\u2019: the neural state initially reflected one choice before changing to reflect the final choice. Finally, we observed momentary \u2018indecision\u2019: delay forming any clear motor plan. Further, moments of neural indecision accompanied moments of behavioral indecision. Together, these results reveal the rich and diverse set of internal events long suspected to occur during free choice."

As the monkeys performed this target-selection task, arrays of electrodes recorded the activity of two brain regions that are involved in the planning of movements. These signals reliably predicted which of the two targets the monkey was favouring, several hundred milliseconds before the monkey was instructed to start moving his finger. Moreover, these patterns of neural activity reflected whether the monkey responded immediately or hesitated, made a firm choice or wavered, or stuck to his original choice or changed his mind."

However, it was not clear whether the two regions of the brain studied in the experiments were responsible for making the decisions about target selection, or if the activity in these areas reflected a decision that had been taken elsewhere in the brain. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the approach developed by Kaufman et al. allows researchers to follow aspects of the decision-making process as it happens, including those times when the monkey changes its mind."

When a monkey is instructed about an upcoming movement but not yet allowed to make it, neurons in these areas show changes in firing rate that reflect the properties of the upcoming reach, including direction (<a href=\"#bib21\">Evarts, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tanji and Evarts, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Weinrich and Wise, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Godschalk et al., 1985</a>), distance (<a href=\"#bib39\">Riehle and Requin, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Messier and Kalaska, 2000</a>), speed (<a href=\"#bib13\">Churchland et al., 2006a</a>), and curvature (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hocherman and Wise, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pearce and Moran, 2012</a>). PMd and M1 may (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pastor-Bernier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Thura and Cisek, 2014</a>) or may not be involved in actually making decisions, but these areas are known to reflect the momentary decision state (<a href=\"#bib48\">Thura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Thura and Cisek, 2014</a>) and therefore can be exploited as a window into the ongoing decision process. While studies of decision making typically focus on deliberative decisions based on noisy sensory evidence (e.g., <a href=\"#bib9\">Britten et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Afraz et al., 2006</a>) or value optimization (e.g., <a href=\"#bib45\">Sugrue et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Thura and Cisek, 2014</a>), we used a novel task in which the monkey was encouraged to decide quickly, yet often had time to change his mind if desired. Though recent studies have examined changes of mind driven by fluctuating sensory evidence (<a href=\"#bib38\">Resulaj et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bollimunta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Insabato et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kiani et al., 2014</a>), the internal events that accompany truly free choices have largely remained hypothetical. Using single-trial methods, we were able to examine how free choices proceed despite the potential for this process to vary from trial to trial. In particular, we were able to test whether free choices generally proceed similarly to \u2018forced choices\u2019 in the motor system, determine how frequently the monkeys revised their initial motor plan, and provide insight into why some trials suffered slow reaction times (RTs)."

This task is somewhat analogous to a driver choosing a lane. Often one attempts to pick a lane that will be most expeditious. The choice may be determined by the environment: for example, one lane is blocked by a large truck and the other is nearly empty. On other occasions the choice is more ambiguous. Both lanes may have some cars or both may be clear. We are all familiar with the experience of rapidly weighing these choices, and with the vacillation and hesitation that can result. Our task is roughly analogous: often the stimulus does not fully specify the right answer, leaving a choice to be made."

As expected, choices were also influenced by barrier changes during the delay period (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; dataset N2 showed imperfect responses to barrier changes, and was thus excluded from one analysis below). For example, if the leftward target became more accessible as the result of a barrier change then the probability of choosing left increased. While biases were common (much as they would be for drivers choosing lanes) both monkeys made reaches to both targets when given a choice, and reached more often to a target when it was easy than when it was hard. Finally, the monkeys occasionally \u2018changed their mind\u2019 mid-reach: they began reaching toward one target but performed a sharp turn and reached to the other target (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In most of these overt change-of-mind trials, both options were available when the monkey deviated from his original reach. Depending on the trial, these changes of mind were driven either by a barrier change that only altered the relative difficulties of the two options, or by some purely internal process. Thus, \u2018freedom of choice\u2019 was indeed exercised."

To provide the necessary statistical power to observe internal events on a single-trial basis, neural data were recorded using two 96-electrode arrays (in PMd and M1) per monkey. These recordings yielded 96\u2013196 single- and multi-units per dataset. Since neurons were recorded simultaneously, we could neither optimize target locations for each neuron separately nor select for strongly responsive neurons. Instead, we selected target arrangements that evoked both possible choices and drove particularly robust population responses, which for some datasets yielded sufficient statistical power for good decoding of choice on single trials. This selection yielded seven datasets for analysis: two target arrangements (T and S mazes) for monkey J across 2 days (J1 and J2), and one target arrangement (S maze) for monkey N for 3 days (N1, N2 and N3)."

In order for this to occur, the monkey needed to visually parse the arrangement of barriers and targets, determine which target was accessible, and form a motor plan that would reach the target and avoid the barriers. A key question is whether the neural activity during free choices reflects the eventual movement in a similar way and with a similar time course. This is not a given: during free choices, the preparatory activity might maintain its baseline state, achieve an intermediate state to make a change of mind \u2018easier\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fleming et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ifft et al., 2012</a>), might develop more slowly, or might vacillate between the choices continually."

For most neurons, the average response only depended on which reach was made; responses were similar regardless of whether a choice was forced or free. Interestingly, for most neurons, the time course of the neural response was nearly identical for forced and free choices. This implies that the monkey formed a motor plan quickly when presented with a free choice: that is, the time to make an initial movement selection for free choices did not take appreciably longer than the time to determine which target was accessible for forced choices. For a smaller fraction of neurons, free-choice trials exhibited selectivity that was weaker than for forced-choice trials (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, neurons consistently \u2018preferred\u2019 the same target in free-choice trials as in forced-choice trials (102 of 104 significantly tuned units maintained their preference), and neurons' trial-averaged responses during the delay strongly correlated for forced and free choices (mean r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001 for 6/7 datasets, p &lt; 0.01 for N3-S; sign test; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

Free choice decoder performance was less accurate for the two datasets with fewer trials (N2-S and N3-S), at 80%. Neural data from all the long-delay free choice trials (including four barrier configurations), in which neither target was blocked and in which no barrier changes occurred, are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013I</a> (saturated traces, forced-choice trials shown as faded traces for context; see also <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>; p &lt; 10<sup>\u22126</sup> for all datasets). As expected, decoding was unsuccessful before maze onset, for either forced or free choices. The slightly lower decoder performance on free choice trials was not due to any systematic shift in neurons' preferences: retraining the decoder using free-choice trials did not improve performance on free-choice trials (96% and 77% for monkeys J and N, assessed via leave-one-out cross-validation). Thus, in PMd and M1 the neural events during free choices closely resemble those during forced choices that result in the same movement. Rather, the lower performance of the decoder may reflect some additional complexity during free choices, such as last-moment changes of mind. The decoder is not given access to the data from shortly before movement onset, so any such last-moment changes of mind will necessarily be missed."

For the other \u2018unlucky\u2019 half of trials, we expect that the monkey must re-plan. This can be clearly seen in the decoded choice: when the barrier change occurred mid-delay (at least 100 ms after maze onset but at least 50 ms before the Go cue), as expected there were large swings in the decoded choice on about half the trials following the change event (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; dots indicate barrier change).

Using a conservative algorithm (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we identified trials in which the decoder initially produced a value indicating one choice, then underwent a large swing to indicate the opposite choice. These trials are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a> (saturated traces; see also <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for vacillation and non-vacillation trials plotted separately, and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> for two examples). Using these same conservative criteria, 13% (3\u201324% range over datasets) of free-choice trials exhibited such spontaneous vacillations, compared to only 2% (2\u20134%) of forced-choice trials (forced-choice assessed using leave-one-out cross-validated decoding). Vacillation trials were more common among free-choice trials than forced-choice trials in every one of the 7 datasets (p &lt; 10<sup>\u22129</sup> pooled; \u03c7<sup>2</sup> 2 \u00d7 2 contingency test; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>, left). This difference in frequency also reached statistical significance for 5/7 datasets when considered individually (p &lt; 0.05, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> 2 \u00d7 2 contingency test). To our knowledge, observations of such spontaneous vacillations when presented with a free choice\u2014without changing external evidence\u2014have not previously been described."

For the 5 datasets that could be decoded most accurately (all four J datasets and N1-S), we considered the data from PMd and M1 separately. Specifically, we asked whether the decoded choice from these two areas agreed at time points at least 160 ms into the delay period; this time point was chosen to be late enough that the decoded choice reflected a real choice and not just noise (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Despite the much higher noise levels involved when splitting our data into two (not necessarily equal) parts, the results from decoding PMd agreed with the results from decoding M1 with a similar reliability as expected from how well each decoder agreed with the behavior. This was true when considering all trials (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) or free choice trials alone (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Moreover, we could examine vacillation trials specifically. On the same trials, we could often see similar vacillations when decoding PMd and M1 separately (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>), though this was not always the case (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>)."

To check for this possibility, we performed a simple control. For each vacillation trial, we considered the last time the decoded choice switched sign. We counted how many times it was left-to-right, and how many times it was right-to-left. In 3/7 datasets, left-to-right switches were more common; in 3/7, right-to-left were more common; in 1 dataset they were tied. It is not entirely clear why at baseline the decode choice tended to register as \u2018leftward\u2019, but it does not appear that this baseline bias affected our ability to identify vacillations."

These trials began as forced, then a barrier changed difficulty during the delay to provide a free choice. On some trials the monkey reached to the always-accessible option (\u2018untaken\u2019 switch trials). On other trials (\u2018taken\u2019 switch trials) the monkey reached to the side that had changed, presumably reflecting a change of mind from the initial option to the newly-accessible target. Indeed, for taken-switch trials the decoded choice over time often reflected the change of mind well before movement onset (saturated traces in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). For these taken-switch trials, 40% exhibited a large change in the decoded choice (15\u201375%; assessed as for vacillations; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) in the period from 160 ms after maze onset until 200 ms before movement onset. The remaining taken-switch trials presumably involved switches in the internal state that occurred after the analyzed period (i.e., just before or as the monkey began reaching), consistent with recent work showing that planning and re-planning can be rapid (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ames et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wong et al., 2014</a>). On untaken-switch trials, the decoded choice was generally steady, as expected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Only 5% (0\u201317%) of untaken-switch trials exhibited such a large change in the decoded choice. In all 7 datasets, large changes in the decoded choice were more common for taken-switch trials than untaken-switch trials (p &lt; 10<sup>\u22129</sup> pooled; p &lt; 0.02 for 6/7 datasets assessed individually, N3-S n.s.; \u03c7<sup>2</sup> 2 \u00d7 2 contingency test; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>, center). Thus, changes in the decoded choice were common for conditions where they were expected to be present, and uncommon for conditions where they were expected to be rare. This result provides further validation of the decoder."

These trials began with a free choice, with one side hard and the other easy. During the delay, the hard key barrier changed to become easy as well. Behavioral statistics indicate that these barrier changes successfully induced changes of mind on many trials (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In particular, there were many \u2018likely change\u2019 trials: for example, a trial where the rightward target had been hard, became easy, and was eventually chosen. Yet behavior alone cannot tell us <i>which</i> of those trials involved internal changes of mind: the monkey may have chosen the hard target from the start, as sometimes occurred during free choices. At the neural level, large changes in the decoded choice were frequently apparent: they comprised 41% (29\u201350%) of such likely change trials (saturated traces in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Conversely, on trials where the monkey eventually reached to a target that was easy throughout, changes of mind were presumably uncommon: most likely the monkey immediately chose the easy target and maintained this plan. Accordingly, for these \u2018unlikely change\u2019 trials changes in the decoded choice were observed less frequently: only 12% (4\u201323%) of trials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

First, we asked whether these changes of mind required a return to the baseline state. To do so, we examined the distance between the neural state during changes of mind and the neural state before the maze onset (baseline). The changes of mind did not approach the baseline state for either induced changes (on biasing-change trials) or spontaneous vacillations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). That is, although we used a one-dimensional neural readout as a decoder, the neural state was multidimensional and in those other dimensions the neural state did not pass through baseline during changes of mind. This is consistent with previous findings about the neural response when a single target jumps from one location to another (<a href=\"#bib4\">Archambault et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ames et al., 2014</a>)."

This is challenging because of the heterogeneity of event timing, but we could nonetheless ask whether individual units' firing rates were unusually high or low during these changes of mind. To do so, we compared firing rates during a time window around the change of mind with matched windows on similar non-change-of-mind trials (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). For trials in which a change of mind was induced by a changing barrier, there was no systematic difference in firing rates relative to non-change-of-mind trials; units had higher-than-average and lower-than average firing rates with similar frequencies (30% were higher, 26% lower, 44% in the normal range; p = 0.16 pooled over datasets). However, during vacillation trials, firing rates tended to be slightly low relative to non-vacillation trials: 37% of units had lower-than-average firing rates during the vacillation, while only 27% were higher than average (p = 0.04 for J; p = 0.009 for N; Z-test for proportions; remaining units were in the normal range). This suggests that changes of mind induced by outside events may represent a slightly different process from spontaneous vacillation. However, vacillations occurred earlier on average than shifts in choice due to barrier changes, so this firing rate difference may reflect the time course of motor preparation rather than a difference between spontaneous vacillation and induced changes of mind."

Focusing first on execution, we returned to untaken-switch trials. These correspond to a situation we have all experienced: at the last minute an option becomes available, but we choose not to exercise it. This last-moment offer nonetheless produced behavioral consequences: the monkey occasionally exhibited slowed RTs even though his choice was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We hypothesized that this slowing might be due to a transient re-planning event.

This suggests that the slow RTs on these trials were not due to re-planning/vacillation, but instead involved a \u2018hesitation\u2019 to execute.

Such an effect is not inevitable (there is little advantage to indecision when both choices are good) and was not always observed. However, for one dataset the monkey did appear to undergo such moments of indecision: when a choice had to be made immediately upon maze presentation, the RT was often longer for two possible choices than for one choice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, dataset J2-S; median difference 56 ms, p &lt; 0.001, Mann\u2013Whitney <i>U</i> test). These indecisive moments were present for trials resulting in either left or right choices (RT distributions were generally similar for left and right). Although this interesting behavior was only present in one dataset, the ability to analyze individual trials allows us to identify neural correlates. We hypothesized that these slow RTs might be due to a slowly-developing initial motor plan or quick vacillation. In accordance with this idea, there was a strong relationship between a trial initially exhibiting an \u2018incorrect\u2019 decoded choice (relative to the eventual reach) and that trial having a slow RT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, this moment of indecision was distinct from hesitation, which did not have an obvious correlate in the decoded choice. As a control, we compared the datasets in which free-choice RTs were not slowed substantially (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); the neural effect was absent in these datasets, as expected. Thus, neural \u2018indecision\u2019 was observed only when there was behavioral indecision."

Here, we trained monkeys to perform a novel task that often presented two viable options with either answer resulting in the same reward. We then examined the dynamics of decision making using single-trial, moment-by-moment decoding of preparatory activity from PMd and M1. We found that motor plans for forced-choice and free-choice trials were typically similar and formed with similar speed. However, as suspected, these plans were sometimes revised later. These changes of mind were essentially never observed when the animal was presented with forced choices; this internal process was specific to free choices."

These \u2018small\u2019 errors could not readily give rise to strong apparent changes of mind. Second, trials with short delay lengths effectively acted as probes of the decoded choice at different time points. These probes permitted us to verify that the decoded choice matched the monkey's intention throughout the delay, since the monkeys did not know the delay duration in advance. Third, we observed many clear changes of mind under conditions where they were expected (free-to-forced, taken-switch, and likely change trials), and much less frequently when they were expected to be uncommon (forced choice, untaken-switch, and unlikely change trials)."

It is not entirely clear why this was the case. One candidate cause of this accuracy difference might have been systematic differences in tuning between forced and free. However, such differences do not seem to be at fault, because decoders trained using free choice trials performed similarly or less well. Other studies have presented two targets that were disambiguated only after the Go cue; in those circumstances, two competing motor plans have been observed both in the saccadic system (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stanford et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Costello et al., 2013</a>) and for reaching movements (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cisek, 2006</a>). Here, however, competing motor plans seem unlikely to have interfered with the decoder on most trials: competing motor plans would tend to produce a decoded choice of intermediate magnitude, which was not typical in our data. Instead, we speculate that last-moment changes of mind, occurring after the epoch we decoded, were a more likely culprit. Two pieces of evidence support this hypothesis. First, it is known that responses can change quickly to follow a target that has jumped (<a href=\"#bib4\">Archambault et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2011</a>). Second, our decoder's accuracy was lowest by far in cases where late changes of mind were frequent (taken-switch and likely change trials). This suggests that some of these changes of mind either do not require re-planning (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ames et al., 2014</a>) or that re-planning occurs at the very last moment (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wong et al., 2014</a>). This ability to change one's mind presumably reflects rich internal processing that can continually reevaluate both what act to make and whether to make it now."

For example, indecision (delay in making an initial motor plan when faced with a choice) occurred in only one dataset, yet the decoder could provide insight into how a slowly-evolving initial motor plan might explain the slow RT. Such differences between datasets are likely to occur in rich cognitive behaviors, where individuals' strategies may reasonably differ. On hesitation trials (slowed RT when a new option was presented but not exercised), the decoder revealed that the slow RT was not due to re-planning: no vacillations or weakening of the plan were observed on these trials. This permits comparison with saccadic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib37\">Reingold and Stampe, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buonocore and McIntosh, 2012</a>), in which saccades are delayed when a distractor appears shortly after the Go cue. There is evidence that saccadic inhibition may be due to mutual inhibition of competing motor plans (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bompas and Sumner, 2011</a>). Hesitation did not obviously involve the formation of a competing motor plan, but it remains possible that competing motor plans are formed in a trigger-related or upstream area, or during other behaviors (such as indecision). As we learn more about each process, a more mechanistic comparison may become possible."

In our data, motor plans were typically formed quickly, corresponding to preliminary choices. However, our data suggest that the moment when neural activity begins to change is not necessarily the moment a decision is finalized (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schurger et al., 2012</a>): the movement can be delayed (hesitation) or the choice revised (vacillation)."

For each trial with a delay of \u2265300 ms, we considered time points \u2265160 ms after maze onset (see above for justification of timing). After this time, to be considered a change of mind the time course of the decoded choice had to meet three criteria: (1) at some time point, it needed to change from leftward to rightward or vice versa; (2) at some time point, it needed to be \u226510 times as likely to come from the \u2018leftward\u2019 forced-choice distribution of decoded choice as from the \u2018rightward\u2019 forced-choice distribution of decoded choice for the same time point; and (3) at some time point, it needed to be \u226510 times as likely to come from the \u2018rightward\u2019 forced-choice distribution of decoded choice as from the \u2018leftward\u2019 forced-choice distribution of decoded choice for the same time point. That is, the decoded choice needed to swing from \u2018strongly left\u2019 to \u2018strongly right\u2019 or vice versa. To determine likelihoods, Gaussian fits were used for the leftward and rightward distributions. For determining the forced-choice distributions of decoded choice at late time points, all time points \u2265600 ms were pooled. To be conservative, when this algorithm was applied to leave-one-out cross-validation trials, the classifier and distributions from that cross-validation fold were used. All trials meeting these criteria are shown in the relevant plots. This algorithm was also used to identify trials for <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>."

We therefore used the following procedure. For each unit, for each vacillation trial, we found the last time that the decoder switched from indicating one choice to the other. We then found the firing rate of that unit in the 200 ms window centered on this crossing time. Next, we found the mean firing rate in the same window for the same unit for all non-vacillation free left-choice trials, and for all non-vacillation free right-choice trials. After repeating this procedure for each vacillation trial, we found three average firing rates: for all the vacillation trials, for all non-vacillation free lefts, and for all non-vacillation free rights. Finally, we categorized the vacillation firing rate as lower than both free rates, between them, or higher than both free rates. The procedure for bias trials was similar: analogously, we compared bias trials on which the decoder did indicate a change of mind (sign change in the decoded choice) with those in which it did not. If instead we repeated the analysis using free choice non-vacillation trials for comparison, results were similar. This last point indicates that the observed difference between vacillations and induced changes of mind were not due to differences in the comparison trials."

To do so, we first identified free choice trials on which the Go cue was presented simultaneously with maze onset, and which evoked an RT \u2265300 ms. For these trials, we considered the decoded choice at 100 ms after maze onset. For the regression, we ensured that a decoded choice agreeing with the eventual choice was positive while a decoded choice disagreeing with the eventual choice was negative. Thus, for trials on which the monkey chose the leftward target, we inverted the sign of the decoded choice. Linear regression was then performed."

For example, drivers learn to stop at a red light. But is that a decision in any interesting sense, i.e. does it involve weighing the outcomes of different alternatives and choosing one based on one's values or preferences, or after accumulating enough evidence about the correct answer? It is thus possible that the data here reflect arbitrary sensorimotor associations, which have been studied for years, particularly in PMd. In such learned associations between a stimulus and response, activity during the delay period is simply preparation for translating a sensory stimulus to a particular upcoming movement."

It would be useful to analyze more behavioral data, and to provide additional analyses. One could be a summary bar plot comparing the percentage of vacillations across all conditions for a given data set, i.e., forced choices, free choices, taken/untaken switches and likely/unlikely changes, indicating whether those percentages differed significantly across conditions (say, based simply on their overall occurrence and binomial statistics)."

(Responses are much more variable when aligned on movement onset, but that is understandable given the dependencies of PMd and M1 neurons on kinematic parameters). Second, such rise-to-threshold models have been used successfully in a variety of choice tasks, not just in random-dots tasks \u2019when information is delivered slowly.\u2018 But if \u2018ramping\u2019 is understood simply as an increase in motor planning activity, then the classic ramping associated with saccades is indeed very quick, on the order of 200 ms (Science 274:427, 1996; Neuron 76:616, 2012). Again, the work of Stanford and colleagues illustrates that a scheme in which alternative motor plans compete to reach a threshold works well even when decisions are urgent and choices quick. The work of Cisek and colleagues is consistent with such competition too, but over much longer time scales (Neuron 45:801, 2005; J Neurosci 29:11560, 2009; Neuron 81:1401, 2014). Thus, the rate at which sensory information is delivered or perceived is orthogonal to this issue of how to characterize motor-planning activity."

Second, GPFA automatically selects the smoothing kernels for each dimension, and when the signal-to-noise is lower it can partly compensate by choosing to smooth over a little more time. We now note this in the Methods (in the subsection headed \u201cSingle-trial decoding\u201d): \u201cAmong other advantages, GPFA chooses smoothing kernels for each dimension to reflect both their natural spectral content and the signal-to-noise available in the data.\u201d"

(Responses are much more variable when aligned on movement onset, but that is understandable given the dependencies of PMd and M1 neurons on kinematic parameters). Second, such rise-to-threshold models have been used successfully in a variety of choice tasks, not just in random-dots tasks \u2019when information is delivered slowly.\u2018 But if \u2018ramping\u2019 is understood simply as an increase in motor planning activity, then the classic ramping associated with saccades is indeed very quick, on the order of 200 ms (Science 274:427, 1996; Neuron 76:616, 2012). Again, the work of Stanford and colleagues illustrates that a scheme in which alternative motor plans compete to reach a threshold works well even when decisions are urgent and choices quick. The work of Cisek and colleagues is consistent with such competition too, but over much longer time scales (Neuron 45:801, 2005; J Neurosci 29:11560, 2009; Neuron 81:1401, 2014). Thus, the rate at which sensory information is delivered or perceived is orthogonal to this issue of how to characterize motor-planning activity</i>."
