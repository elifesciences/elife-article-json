                    "text": "As a first-line vertebrate immune defense, the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transports polymeric IgA and IgM across epithelia to mucosal secretions, where the cleaved ectodomain (secretory component; SC) becomes a component of secretory antibodies, or when unliganded, binds and excludes bacteria. Here we report the 2.6\u00c5 crystal structure of unliganded human SC (hSC) and comparisons with a 1.7\u00c5 structure of teleost fish SC (tSC), an early pIgR ancestor. The hSC structure comprises five immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D5) arranged as a triangle, with an interface between ligand-binding domains D1 and D5. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements confirmed the D1-D5 interface in solution and revealed that it breaks upon ligand binding. Together with binding studies of mutant and chimeric SCs, which revealed domain contributions to secretory antibody formation, these results provide detailed models for SC structure, address pIgR evolution, and demonstrate that SC uses multiple conformations to protect mammals from pathogens."

Here we report the 2.6\u00c5 crystal structure of unliganded human SC (hSC) and comparisons with a 1.7\u00c5 structure of teleost fish SC (tSC), an early pIgR ancestor. The hSC structure comprises five immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D5) arranged as a triangle, with an interface between ligand-binding domains D1 and D5. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements confirmed the D1-D5 interface in solution and revealed that it breaks upon ligand binding. Together with binding studies of mutant and chimeric SCs, which revealed domain contributions to secretory antibody formation, these results provide detailed models for SC structure, address pIgR evolution, and demonstrate that SC uses multiple conformations to protect mammals from pathogens."

The human mucosa protects ~400 m<sup>2</sup> of epithelial barriers in the gut, lungs, urogenital tract, and associated tissues such as mammary glands. Protection is conferred largely through the function of the polymeric Immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which transports and stabilizes secretory antibodies and also functions as an innate immune factor (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaetzel, 2005</a>). Human pIgR is a glycosylated type I membrane protein consisting of a 620-residue ectodomain with five tandem immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, a 23-residue transmembrane domain, and a 103-residue intracellular domain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hamburger et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). pIgR is the oldest identifiable Fc receptor, first emerging in teleost (bony) fish. Throughout evolution, the number of Ig-like domains in the pIgR ectodomain increased; typically, bony fish express a two-domain variant, birds, amphibians and reptiles a four-domain variant, and mammals a five-domain variant (D1-D5) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akula et al., 2014</a>). Mammals, including rabbits and cows, express an alternatively-spliced variant containing D1, D4 and D5 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Deitcher and Mostov, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kulseth et al., 1995</a>)."

Similar to other antibody classes, each IgA and IgM monomer contains two Fab arms and one Fc region (a dimer of IgA heavy chain domains C\u03b12 and C\u03b13 or IgM domains C\u00b52, C\u00b53 and C\u00b54). Unlike other antibody classes, IgA and IgM monomers can polymerize, producing dimeric IgA (dIgA), pentameric IgM (pIgM), and to a lesser extent, higher order polymers. Adjoining monomers are linked tail-to-tail through heavy chain C-terminal extensions (tailpiece; tp) and a 137-residue protein called joining (J) chain and are stabilized through disulfide bonds (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hamburger et al., 2006</a>). The transport cycle of pIgR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) starts when pIgR at the basolateral membrane binds dIgA or pIgM, and the resulting complex is transcytosed to the apical surface where proteases cleave the pIgR ectodomain (now referred to as secretory component, SC), releasing it into the mucosa as a complex with dIgA or pIgM. These complexes, Secretory IgA (SIgA; the predominant mucosal antibody) and Secretory IgM (SIgM), exclude pathogens from the epithelial barrier and promote host relationships with commensal bacteria through innate and adaptive mechanisms. SC specifically protects secretory Ig from proteolytic degradation and confers innate recognition functions upon SIgA and SIgM, allowing them to bind and exclude bacteria (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaetzel, 2005</a>). Although binding to polymeric Ig stimulates pIgR transcytosis (<a href=\"#bib55\">Song et al., 1994</a>), up to 50% of pIgR in humans trafficks to the apical surface and is released as unliganded, or free, SC (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brandtzaeg, 1971</a>), which can exclude pathogenic bacteria and bacterial toxins through protein-protein or protein-glycan interactions (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaetzel, 2005</a>). In humans, SC binds the major <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> surface protein, choline binding protein A (CbpA), using protein-protein interactions, and to pathogenic bacteria such as <i>H. pylori, E. coli</i> and <i>Shigella</i> spp, using complex carbohydrates attached to one or more of its seven potential <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation sites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaetzel, 2005</a>). SC carbohydrates have also been shown to facilitate binding to host mucus, host protein IL-8, commensal bacteria <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacteria</i> and contribute to microbiota homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaetzel, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mathias and Corthesy, 2011</a>). SC and SIgA interactions with pathogens and commensals are thought to be especially important for nursing infants, who ingest large quantities of maternal free SC and SIgA (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hurley and Theil, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rogier et al., 2014</a>)."

High-resolution structural information for SC and the SC interactions with polymeric immunoglobulin (pIg) ligands is limited to a crystal structure of the human SC D1 domain, which adopts an Ig-variable (V)-like fold (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hamburger et al., 2004</a>). The structures and contributions of D2-D5 to intact SC function are largely unknown. D1 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to pIg Fcs and is also thought to interact with J-chain because pIgR transports only J-chain\u2013containing pIgs, and isolated D1 does not bind monomeric IgA. D1 binding to pIg is partly mediated by three D1 loops that are structurally equivalent to the antigen-binding complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of immunoglobulin variable domains (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hamburger et al., 2006</a>). Binding to dIgA can be further stabilized by a disulfide bond between SC D5 and Fc\u03b1 C\u03b12; however, this interaction is absent in some SIgA complexes and does not form in SIgM (<a href=\"#bib5\">Almogren et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hamburger et al., 2006</a>)."

We characterized the conformation and dynamics of free and liganded hSC in solution, and used structure-based alignments to create mutant and chimeric SCs to determine how individual domains contribute to ligand binding. These results provide a detailed model for SC structure and pIg binding mechanisms, demonstrating that mammalian SC evolved to adopt a compact, closed triangular structure, which opens upon ligand binding, whereas two-domain SC ancestors consist of tandem domains arranged in an elongated conformation. For hSC, we show that each of the five domains adopt distinct associations with each other in unliganded versus liganded forms, and that each contributes uniquely to dIgA and pIgM recognition and secretory antibody formation."

The final model (540 ordered residues of 549 total) revealed five Ig-like domains (D1-D5) arranged into a compact triangle (three sides of ~70\u00c5, ~70\u00c5 and ~90\u00c5) in which D2-D3 and D4-D5 form two of the sides, and D1 contacts both D2 and D4-D5 to form the third side (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The domains lie in a plane such that the triangle thickness is roughly equal to that of a single domain (~40\u00c5) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). The overall arrangement involves extensive interfaces between all five domains and a small solvent-accessible hole (~14\u00c5 diameter) in the center. As defined in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, the hSC front face shows all five domains. A 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation reveals a side face dominated by D2 and D3; another 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation reveals the back face showing all five domains, and a further 90\u00b0 rotation reveals a side face comprising D4 and D5. A fifth face is formed at the bottom of the hSC triangle (90\u00b0 from the front and back faces), which includes D5, D1 and D2, and all domains are visible when viewed from the top. Important SC motifs, including CDRs, some residues implicated in ligand binding, and potential <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation sites, are largely solvent exposed and distributed on all faces of the molecule (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). The D1 CDR1 and CDR3 loops, which contribute to dIgA and pIgM binding (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaetzel, 2005</a>), are exposed exclusively on the front face, whereas the D4 CDRs are exposed only on the back face. The D2, D3 and D5 CDRs are exposed on both faces and at least one side, and D5 residues Cys468 and Cys502, which can disulfide bond with the dIgA residue Cys311 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hamburger et al., 2006</a>), are exposed on the D4-D5 side."

We observed partially\u00a0ordered glycans at four sites (D1 sites Asn65 and Asn72, D2 site Asn168, and D5 site Asn481), which do not contact protein portions of hSC. These observations suggest that carbohydrates are unlikely to stabilize the hSC domain arrangement directly, but are optimally positioned to allow hSC to bind pIg ligands and to facilitate lectin interactions with free hSC and SIgA. At least one <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation site is visible from each orientation; however, six of the seven potential glycosylation sites are clustered on the back and bottom faces of the molecule (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>)."

IgSF domains share a basic folding topology consisting of two \u03b2-sheets linked through a conserved disulfide bond. The domains are classified as Variable (V), Intermediate (I) or Constant (C) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang, 2013</a>). D1-D4 each adopt an Ig-V-like fold, which typically contain \u03b2-strands A, B, E, D on one sheet and strands A\u2019, G, F, C, C\u2019, C\u201d on the other. As reported for D1, the loops connecting strands B-C, C\u2019-C\u201d, and F-G are similar to IgV CDRs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hamburger et al., 2004</a>). In contrast to D1, domains D2-D4 each lack an A strand that would normally pair with the \u03b2-sheet containing strands B, E, and D (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>). The A strand-equivalent residues in these domains instead form the D1-D2, D2-D3 and D3-D4 linkers. In addition to the canonical Ig disulfide bond connecting strands B and F, domains D1, D3, D4 and D5 include a second disulfide that links the C and C\u2019 strands. Despite lacking the C-C\u2019 disulfide, the relative orientation of the C and C\u2019 \u03b2-strands in D2 is similar to other SC domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). D5 topology diverges from the canonical IgV fold because, in common with both the IgI and IgC folds, it lacks the C\u201d strand and associated CDR2 loop (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). D5 also diverges from D2-D4 because residues following the D4-D5 linker hydrogen bond to the B strand, providing D5 with a two-residue A strand, a feature found in IgV and IgI but absent in IgC (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang, 2013</a>). Taken together, D5 topology resembles IgI, although it lacks conserved interactions that typically link loops equivalent to CDR1 and CDR3 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang, 2013</a>)."

The D5 CDR1 differs from the other CDR1s because it is disulfide bonded to the neighboring DE loop (residues Cys468 in CDR1 and Cys502 in the DE loop) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Notably, the D5 DE loop is 12 residues long, compared to 3-4 residues in D1-D3 and 7 residues in D4, and extends ~10\u00c5 beyond the position occupied by DE loops in other domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>).

To evaluate the conformational flexibility of hSC in solution, we conducted double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy on free and liganded forms of hSC variants containing pairs of nitroxide spin labels. A DEER experiment measures the probability distribution of inter-nitroxide distances in the 17\u201380\u00c5 range (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jeschke and Polyhach, 2007</a>). The most probable distance and width of the distribution provide direct information on the structure and structural heterogeneity, respectively, and are presumed to reflect the amplitude of molecular motion in solution under physiological conditions. Compared to methods such as crystallography and electron microscopy that capture snapshots of protein structure, DEER has the advantage of providing analytical data that describe a protein\u2019s structural heterogeneity and flexibility (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hubbell et al., 2013</a>)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, ligand binding induced a dramatic separation of D1 and D5, leading to a broad distance distribution between the R1 residues, extending beyond 70\u00c5. The position and widths of the distance distribution for distances beyond 70\u00c5 are not well-determined, but the data are consistent with movements of more than ~42\u00c5 between D1-D5. Despite this remarkable domain separation, the intra-domain distance distribution of D5-455R1/D5-491R1 remained unchanged (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), and the continuous wavelength (CW) EPR spectra did not change for any of the sites (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), indicating that the local structure around R1 was unperturbed.

The fish genome does not encode a J-chain, thus fish pIgs are thought to be structurally divergent from their human counterparts (<a href=\"#bib21\">Flajnik, 2010</a>). In addition, tSC contains just two extracellular domains, tD1 and tD2. tD1 and tD2 share homology with mammalian D1 and D5, respectively, but CDR loop residues implicated in mammalian SC interactions with pIg are not conserved (<a href=\"#bib20\">Feng et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hamuro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rombout et al., 2008</a>)."

                                "text": "The structure of tSC revealed two tandem Ig-like domains related by ~90\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Like hSC domains D1 and D3-D5, tSC domains are IgSF folds that include the canonical B to F strand disulfide bond and a second disulfide bond linking the C and C\u2019 strands. tD1 and tD2 share a similar topology (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), but only 72 of 97 C\u03b1 atoms could be aligned (rmsd = 0.87\u00c5). Aligning fish and human SC domains resulted in rmsds of 0.77\u00c5 for tD1 and D1 (83 of 100 C\u03b1 atoms) and 1.08\u00c5 for tD2 and D5 (64 of 97 C\u03b1 atoms) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). The largest structural differences between tSC and hSC domains are in regions between the C\u2019 and D strands, where tD1 residues at positions similar to the C\u201d strand are disordered and the tD2 C\u201d strand hydrogen bonds to the D strand on the A-B-E-D face rather than to the C\u2019 strand on the A\u2019-G-F-C face (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), similar to other IgSF proteins such as IREMs (immune receptors expressed on myeloid cells) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Marquez et al., 2007</a>). These differences are coupled with distinct features in tSC CDR2 loops and neighboring residues, which include a patch of negative electrostatic potential on tD2 formed from six negatively charged residues in the CDR2, C\u201d, and D strands. The tSC CDR1 and CDR3 loops also adopt distinct conformations. In contrast to the human D1 CDR1 \u03b1-helical turn, both tSC CDR1 loops include a 3<sub>10</sub> helical turn and are structurally similar to human D5 CDR1. The tD1 CDR1 is solvent exposed and highly conserved among representative fish SC sequences, while the tD2 CDR1 is partly in contact with tD1 and contains fewer conserved residues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). The residues in the CDR3 loops are largely conserved among fish (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), but differ between tSC domains; the tD1 CDR3 is elongated, extending toward CDR1 and containing a short helical turn, whereas the tD2 CDR3 is shorter, similar to the D5 CDR3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). tD2 has a 4-residue DE loop, similar to counterpart loops in human D1-D4 and in contrast to the extended loop and disulfide link to CDR1 found in human D5. The interface between the two tSC domains is formed by residues in the tD1 A\u2019-B and E-F loops and residues in tD2 CDR1 and DE loop, burying a total surface area of 591\u00c5<sup>2</sup>. Ten of the 17 residues in the interface are well conserved among representative fish species, and five inter-domain hydrogen bonds may limit inter-domain flexibility (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Collectively, structural differences between the tD1-tD2 and their human D1 and D5 counterparts may represent adaptations that are advantageous for binding to species-specific ligands."

Our approach involved evaluating the ability of short hSC variants and human-fish SC chimeric proteins to bind human dIgA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and pIgM (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Unless otherwise noted, hSC D5 residues Cys468 and Cys502 were mutated to alanine to prevent covalent binding to dIgA. All hSC variants and human-fish chimeric proteins were monomeric and monodisperse as verified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and/or SEC with in-line multi-angle light scattering (MALS) (data not shown). Although the stoichiometry of hSC to pIg in SIg complexes is reportedly 1:1, binding is thought to occur through a multi-step mechanism (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hamburger et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with this model and the demonstration of a ligand binding-induced conformational change in hSC, the binding profiles of our SC variants failed to fit single state kinetic models. Because uncertainties in the binding mechanism precluded accurate selection of a kinetic model, we qualitatively monitored differences in the SPR binding profiles to identify changes in kinetics among protein variants."

We characterized chimeric protein binding to immobilized dIgA by SPR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>) and calculated equilibrium binding affinities (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>) from maximal binding response values (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Binding of hSC (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>~63+/-4nM) and the hSC-tDE chimera (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>~65+/-3nM) were indistinguishable. By contrast, the hSC-tCDR1 chimera exhibited subtle changes during dissociation from dIgA, and the affinity (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>~82+/-1nM) was slightly reduced compared with the hSC D1-D5 affinity. The affinity for dIgA was further reduced (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>~140+/-7nM), and the dissociation phase was shorter when the binding of a double chimera (hSC-tCDR1/tDE) was evaluated (asterisk, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Taken together, these data suggested that D5 mediates direct non-covalent interactions between hSC and dIgA. Since the double chimera exhibited a greater reduction in binding than the hSC-tCDR1 chimeric protein, the D5 DE loop may play a role in stabilizing the position of D5 CDR1, which could be enhanced in the presence of the disulfide that normally links the two motifs (absent in our binding studies). The hSC-tCDR1/tDE did not mimic the binding kinetics of D1 for dIgA, suggesting that additional, as yet unidentified, interfaces contributed to binding affinity and/or that the binding mechanism of D1 was indirectly altered by the presence of D2-D5, perhaps because isolated D1 would not require a conformational change to maximally expose surface area involved in binding. Alternatively, fish motifs found in the chimeric proteins could confer positive binding interactions for dIgA."

Both variants exhibited robust, concentration-dependent binding to dIgA; however, dissociation occurred rapidly, with all of the injected protein dissociating ~200 s into the experiment compared to ~400 s for hSC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,I\u2013J</a>), similar to the binding kinetics of the D1\u2013dIgA interaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These results suggest that D2, and possibly D3, contribute to binding by providing direct interactions with ligand and/or by promoting interactions between D5 and dIgA.

Despite its importance, relatively little was known of pIgR/SC structure. Models ranged from schematic representations of elongated tandemly-arranged domains (<a href=\"#bib44\">Monteiro and Van De Winkel, 2003</a>) to solution scattering-based, computational models of J-shaped molecules, in which D1 makes contacts only with D2 (via the D1-D2 linker), and D2-D3 are folded back toward D4-D5, leaving all D1 binding motifs free to interact with ligand (<a href=\"#bib4\">Almogren et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bonner et al., 2007</a>). Here we present atomic resolution structures that detail how the SC structure has changed over the course of vertebrate evolution, showing that bony fish utilize the two domains of ancestral SC to form an open, elongated structure whereas mammals utilize five domains to form a closed, triangular structure that opens upon ligand binding. These differences are accompanied by domain-specific structural variations and together suggest that SC has evolved into a structurally-plastic molecule that protects mammals by specifically modulating its conformation for its known functions as free SC, SIgA, and SIgM. The mammalian SC might be described as the host immune system\u2019s hand, whose thumb (D1) and four fingers (D2-D5) can form a fist or open to grasp a polymeric antibody in order to fight potential invaders. By contrast, the more primitive two-domain fish SC could be described as a single finger, already in an open conformation for ligand binding and lacking the dexterity of a hand."

While parallel evolutionary changes in receptors and their ligands are common, it was unexpected to find that the addition of D2, D3 and D4 domains in mammals was associated with a closed conformation that occluded putative ligand-binding motifs. Burial of ligand-binding motifs hints that the closed conformation provides mammalian\u00a0SC with advantages that are separate from its binding to polymeric antibodies. For unliganded SC released into the mucosa, the closed conformation could protect SC from proteases by burying susceptible inter-domain linkers and loops, and also promote interactions with commensal and/or pathogenic bacteria. Supporting the notion that the closed conformation is important for unliganded hSC function, our structure suggests that the D1-D5 interface would be stabilized in acidic mucosa because protonation of D1 His32 that occurs at acidic pH would facilitate electrostatic interactions with conserved acidic residues in D5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The\u00a0hSC structure also provides insight into hSC interactions with the human pathogen <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>. Unliganded hSC and SIgA use residues in D3 and D4 to bind to the major <i>S. pneumoniae</i> adhesion protein CbpA, and a peptide corresponding to hSC D4 residues 349\u2013375 inhibited <i>S. pneumoniae</i> adherence to epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaetzel, 2005</a>). The hSC structure shows that residues 349\u2013375 occupy solvent-exposed regions of D4 CDR1 and the D3-contacting regions of the C-C\u2019 loop, rationalizing why both D3 and D4 are required for the interaction with CbpA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In addition, since SIgA binds CbpA, this suggests that these regions of hSC remain exposed upon binding to dIgA."

Of particular significance is the change in the positions of D1 and D5 upon binding to both dIgA and pIgM, as identified in DEER experiments. The large magnitude of this change (more than 40\u00c5), along with evidence for flexible inter-domain linkers, implies that the D1-D5 interface is broken during ligand binding and suggests that the conformational change involves other domains and exposes additional ligand binding motifs on SC (e.g., by enhancing accessibility to D1 binding motifs). Our SPR data demonstrated that during this process, all five domains contribute to binding kinetics and that D5 binds dIgA independent of covalent bond formation. These observations suggest that non-covalent interactions between D5 CDR1 and DE loops can stabilize the complex during the disulfide exchange reaction and also suggest that both D1 and D5 contact dIgA directly in endogenous SIgA that lack covalent interactions with SC (<a href=\"#bib5\">Almogren et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lindh and Bjork, 1976</a>) and in the R1-labeled SC-dIgA complexes used for DEER measurements.

The observation that a conformational change occurs even when binding is dominated by D1 supports the hypotheses that the closed SC conformation occludes D1 binding motifs and that increasing D1 accessibility is an important part of the ligand binding mechanism."

These results suggest that the gain of the D2 domain in mammalian pIgR resulted in enhanced binding to dIgA, perhaps by providing direct contacts and/or by facilitating interactions between D5 and ligand, and further suggest that binding of mammalian splice variants to pIg ligands are mediated primarily through interactions with D1. This possibility is supported by earlier work demonstrating that D2 and D3 were required for covalent binding of D5 to dIgA in other mammals (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crottet and Corthesy, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Solari et al., 1985</a>), an observation we confirmed with an hSC D1-D4-D5 variant (data not shown)."

This implies that D2-D3 play a role in stabilizing the closed hSC conformation. The presence of D3 may be sufficient to stabilize a closed conformation because analysis of the hSC structure suggests that D1-D3-D4-D5 variants could adopt a closed conformation with a D1-D4-D5 interface equivalent to that of hSC. While the absence of a closed conformation might enhance ligand accessibility to D1 binding motifs, it is unclear if this would be advantageous because D1-D4-D5 dissociates from dIgA rapidly compared to D1-D5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). Mammalian SC splice variants transport dIgA in vivo (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kuhn et al., 1983</a>); however, the utility of these variants may be impaired by altered interactions with ligands and/or in any context in which the closed state is advantageous, whether for ligand binding and/or free SC functions."

While it is notable that SIgA and SIgM appear heterogeneous in structure, predicting how hSC domains are arranged in these complexes is challenging. hSC could bind a single Fc, or bind across the dIgA dimer and contact two Fcs (or more in the case of pIgM). Putative hSC D1 interaction sites on dIgA include Fc\u03b1 residues 377, 402\u2013411, 413-414, 440\u2013443, and D5 forms a covalent bond with Fc\u03b1 residue C311 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Woof and Russell, 2011</a>). Interaction sites are maximally separated by ~50\u00c5 when measured between Phe443 and Cys311 in monomeric Fc\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Herr et al., 2003</a>), and likely separated by more than 50\u00c5 when measuring between adjacent Fcs in the dIgA dimer (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Although dIgA contains four copies of all Fc residues implicated\u00a0in binding, SC binds dIgA with 1:1 stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaetzel, 2005</a>), suggesting either that dimeric IgA formation induces conformational differences in Fc\u03b1 that alter the binding site environments and/or that a 1:1 stoichiometry is enforced by hSC interactions with J-chain. Solution scattering models suggested that hSC binds along one side of dIgA in an extended conformation that contacts both Fcs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bonner et al., 2009</a>). These results, taken together with our DEER measurements showing that the D1 and D5 CDR1s could be separated by more than 85\u00c5 upon hSC binding to dIgA in a SIgA molecule (45\u00c5 between D1 and D5 CDR1s in the closed conformation plus &gt;40\u00c5 change in positions of D1 and D5 upon ligand binding), favor a model in which hSC contacts both Fcs in dIgA."

The conformational change frees D5 (and perhaps other domains) to form interactions with the second Fc on dIgA (or another Fc on pIgM) and likely exposes D1 residues such as His32 and Arg34, permitting the ligand to interact with regions previously buried by D4-D5. This incremental binding mechanism, particularly the secondary binding at a previously occluded site, might be necessary or advantageous for binding to a ligand in which binding sites are separated by a long distance (e.g., between adjacent Fcs in dIgA or pIgM) and/or to ensure binding at the correct site(s) if multiple binding sites are exposed on a ligand. Following transcytosis to the apical membrane, the pIgR-pIg complexes are released into the mucosa as SIgA or SIgM, and pIg-associated SC retains an open conformation.

                                "text": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies were performed using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). Human dIgA or pIgM was immobilized on three of four flow cells of CM5 biosensor chips (GE Healthcare) using primary amine coupling (Biacore manual); the remaining flow cell was mock-coupled and used as a reference surface. Ligand densities used for all experiments except those involving D1-D3-D4-D5 were 164, 451, and 765 response units (RUs) for the dIgA surfaces, and 569, 1577, and 4221 RU for pIgM surfaces. Ligand densities used to evaluate D1-D3-D4-D5 binding were 137, 483, and 790 RUs for the dIgA surfaces, and 517, 1779, and 3076 RUs for pIgM surfaces. In experiments evaluating D1-D3-D4-D5 binding, D1-D5 and D1 were included as controls to ensure that proteins bound to different sensor chips reproducibly. Sensorgrams shown in figures were generated from the highest density surfaces. A two-fold dilution series in HBS-EP+ buffer (10\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) P20) was used to test binding of the following analytes (where the highest concentrations of analyte used on dIgA and pIgM surfaces, respectively, are indicated in parentheses following the analyte name: D1-D5 (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M), D1-D5 C468A/C502A (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M), D1 (1.16\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.016\u00a0\u00b5M), D1-D3 (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M), D1-D3-D4-D5 (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M), D1-D4-D5 (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M), D1-D4-D5 C468A/C502A (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M), D2-D3 (65.54\u00a0\u00b5M, 65.54\u00a0\u00b5M), D4-D5 C468A/C502A (65.54\u00a0\u00b5M, 65.54\u00a0\u00b5M), D2-D5 (32.8\u00a0\u00b5M, 32.8\u00a0\u00b5M), CDR1 chimera (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M), DE chimera (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M), CDR1 DE chimera (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M). Additional experiments testing hSC D1-D5 (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M) and D1-67R1/D5-491R1 (1.02\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.26\u00a0\u00b5M) binding to dIgA and pIgM utilized identical parameters except that the HBS-EP+ buffer was supplemented with 20% glycerol to mimic conditions used in DEER experiments. Covalent binding of D1-D4-D5 was tested on a single flow cell of a CM5 biosensor chip with human dIgA surface density of 456 RU. D1-D4-D5 (C468/C502 intact) was manually injected at concentrations up to 4\u00a0\u00b5M and the total response (RU) was recorded at pre-injection baseline, binding, stability, and following regeneration. The baseline response returned to pre-injection levels following regeneration, indicating that no D1-D4-D5 was covalently bound to the surface. In contrast, the same experiment utilizing 1.02\u00a0\u00b5M hSC with intact cysteines (C468/C502) resulted in an ~5RU increase in baseline following each injection/regeneration cycle, indicative of covalent binding to the dIgA-coupled surface. In all experiments the flow rate was 50\u00a0\u00b5l/min, and surfaces were regenerated using 2.5\u00a0M MgCl<sub>2</sub>. All data were collected at 25\u00b0C and processed using T200 Evaluation software (GE Heathcare). Equilibrium binding affinity values were calculated using the T200 Evaluation software (GE Healthcare) and the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The reported affinity values were generated by averaging <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> values obtained from two independent experiments; the corresponding standard deviation was calculated using Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Response data and equilibrium binding models were exported and re-plotted using Prism (GraphPad Software)."

This structure reveals the organization of domains and the location of regions previously implicated in recognition of IgA and IgM, defines folding topology of variable Ig domains, and visualizes domain interfaces and orientations. The authors use DEER spectroscopy to assess solution conformation, heterogeneity and domain flexibility and to reveal a movement of ~40 \u00c5 between D1 and D5 domains. These experiments showed that dimeric IgA (dIgA) and polymeric IgM (pIgM) binding caused a conformational change, consistent with the notion that D1 needs to dissociate from the inter-domain interaction with D5 in order to bind ligands. The results from the SPR experiments suggested that Domains 2-5 contribute to ligand binding to various degrees. Based on these results, the authors proposed a model for how pIgR transports dIgA and pIgM and how it may act on its own as an innate immunity receptor."

The structure of tSC reveals a protein with IgSF fold, where tD1 and tD2 correspond to D1 and D5, in hSC respectively. They follow this up with a careful dissection of hSC domain affinities to functional ligands and end with a schematic summarizing findings for pIgR transcytosis, ligand binding and release of free SC and SIgA. Lastly the authors investigate the SC-pIg interactions by SPR and show that D1 is required for ligand binding while other domains contribute to it."

The DEER experiments do not contribute much beyond demonstrating that a conformational change occurs upon ligand binding. The actual conformation of the ligand bound SC remains unknown. Similarly, the results on the contributions of different domains to ligand binding are suggestive, but the observed effects are subtle and hard to interpret due to the limited combinations of the domains that were tested.

In addition, the significance of the DEER data demonstrating that the closed conformation is the predominant solution conformation should not be underestimated. These data show that hSC is closed (until encountering ligand) rather than existing in equilibrium with alternative states such as intermediates on pathway to ligand binding, and validate the crystal structure, eliminating concern that the observed compact conformation resulted from crystal packing. The DEER data further reveal heterogeneous hSC structures upon ligand binding, indicative of binding intermediates and/or complex flexibility. This type of information is important for understanding SIgA/SIgM complex structure(s) and demonstrate that the complex structures are not accessible to methods such as crystallography or electron microscopy that require rigid and uniform structures. Many structural projects would benefit from a similar combined-methods approach, thus we believe our paper will be useful to others studying systems involving flexible protein complexes."

This challenge arises largely from the difficulty of identifying accurate kinetic models to describe SPR data as well as the possibility that altering domain arrangement will affect SC conformation in an unpredictable and undetectable manner. While testing additional combinations of domains cannot fully remedy this problem, we have now included new SPR data for the binding of a D1-D3-D4-D5 variant (equivalent to SC from birds, reptiles and amphibians) to dIgA and dIgM. These new data, along with a re-worded Discussion that describes our SPR data in the context of accompanying structural and biophysical data, clarify how individual SC domains participate in the ligand binding mechanism."

Since hSC is closed at basic pH, DEER would not detect enhanced stability of the closed conformation at a lower pH. Within a pH range of 5.5-7.4, the amount of time that hSC spends in the closed conformation in vitro is likely to be constant. However, in the mucosa where hSC may face destabilizing factors, such as age, degradation, and/or interactions with proteins or bacteria, a salt bridge between D1 and D5 may stabilize the closed conformation. Until such destabilizing factors are identified, it would be difficult to test the importance of the histidine-mediated interaction between D1 and D5 in a meaningful way."
