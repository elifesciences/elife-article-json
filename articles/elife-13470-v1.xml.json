A nucleotide-dependent stabilising cap at microtubule ends is thought to be lost before this switch can occur; however, the nature and size of this protective cap are unknown. Using a microfluidics-assisted multi-colour TIRF microscopy assay with close-to-nm and sub-second precision, we measured the sizes of the stabilizing cap of individual microtubules. We find that the protective caps are formed by the extended binding regions of EB proteins. Cap lengths vary considerably and longer caps are more stable. Nevertheless, the trigger of instability lies in a short region at the end of the cap, as a quantitative model of cap stability demonstrates. Our study establishes the spatial and kinetic characteristics of the protective cap and provides an insight into the molecular mechanism by which its loss leads to the switch from microtubule growth to shrinkage."

However GTP cannot be visualised in individual dynamic microtubules; therefore the cap size and their relation to individual microtubule stability remains unknown. A variety of models exist, assuming either long caps (several tens of tubulin layers, i.e. hundreds of nanometers long, [<a href=\"#bib17\">Carlier et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chen and Hill, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</a>]) or short caps (1-2 tubulin layers, i.e. 8\u201316 nm only, [<a href=\"#bib3\">Bayley et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bolterauer et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Caplow and Shanks, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Drechsel and Kirschner, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Walker et al., 1991</a>]). Long caps would be a result of random GTP hydrolysis, causing the cap size to increase with growth speed. Short caps would be a consequence of coupled GTP hydrolysis, which would require GTP hydrolysis to accelerate when microtubules grow faster, resulting in a short cap of constant size (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bayley et al., 1989</a>). Alternative models exist that assume either currently not observable structural events for loss of stability, such as formation of cracks (<a href=\"#bib25\">Flyvbjerg et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Margolin et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0or defects, or local biochemical criteria at the very end of the microtubule, introducing a distinction between the total GTP cap and its part that is critical for stabilisation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bowne-Anderson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gardner et al., 2011b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Brun et al., 2009</a>)."

On the other hand, long cap models have been challenged by tubulin dilution experiments (<a href=\"#bib58\">Voter et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Walker et al., 1991</a>). Tubulin dilution causes microtubules to stop growing and hence prevents the addition of new capping tubulins, resulting in microtubules undergoing a catastrophe after a delay of several seconds (<a href=\"#bib60\">Walker et al., 1991</a>). This delay time is thought to be the time it takes for the stabilising structure at the microtubule end to disappear and therefore is a measure of momentary stability at the instant of dilution. In these experiments, delay times were reported to be insensitive to the microtubule growth speed, apparently contradicting 'long cap' models that predict higher stability with increasing growth speed due to longer caps (<a href=\"#bib48\">Padinhateeri et al., 2012</a>). However, the cap size itself could not be visualised in these previous experiments and no quantitative explanation could be given for the observed values of the delay times. Given the reported contradicting results, the size of the stabilising cap and especially its relationship with microtubule stability is still unclear. Ultimately, this is due to a lack of experiments measuring the protective cap size and relating it to the stability of individual microtubules."

For the first time, this allowed us to measure with close-to-nm and sub-second precision the instantaneous stability of individual microtubules, and the instantaneous size of their EB binding site caps, and to directly investigate their relationship. We find that the EB binding region is indeed the stabilising cap. We demonstrate that microtubules with longer caps are more stable and we present a quantitative kinetic model of momentary microtubule stability. Catastrophe is induced when the number of EB binding sites at the very end of the cap has fallen to 15\u201330% of its steady state value. This establishes the basic mechanism of catastrophe induction based on measured protective cap properties."

Fitting traces of the end position and fluorescence background (Materials and methods) allowed us to determine the washout and catastrophe times with sub-sampling time precision, as well as the instantaneous growth speeds measured over a 10\u2009s time period just before washout (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Growth speeds varied considerably around a mean of 28 nm/s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, left). The delay times between washout and catastrophe also showed a broad and non-exponential distribution, with a mean of 7.3\u2009s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, right), similar to previous dilution experiments (<a href=\"#bib60\">Walker et al., 1991</a>). As bending can affect the material properties of microtubules (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schaedel et al., 2015</a>), we tested whether the measured delay times were influenced by mechanical stress, potentially induced by microtubule bending in our assay. We determined the orientation of the growing microtubule end regions relative to the flow direction before tubulin washout, and found that the variation of orientations was relatively small (mean orientation 3.1\u00b0 with a standard deviation of 7.3\u00b0) indicative of good microtubule alignment. No correlation between the delay time and the magnitude of the orientation was observed (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, blue data), indicating that mechanical stress is not responsible for the observed variations of the momentary microtubule stabilities in our assay."

This demonstrates that microtubules are more stable when they grow faster. Interestingly, the strong correlation decreased when the growth speed was measured at earlier times before tubulin washout (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, B</a> right), as quantitatively demonstrated by a gradual decrease of the correlation coefficient and a gradual increase of its p-value (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Therefore, the measured delay times reflect microtubule stability at the moment of tubulin washout and this stability varies over time as the growth speed fluctuates. This might explain why previous tubulin dilution experiments failed to detect the correlation between delay times and growth speeds; there average growth speeds were measured over long time intervals (<a href=\"#bib60\">Walker et al., 1991</a>)."

This average track demonstrated that microtubules did not simply pause between washout and catastrophe as previous lower resolution measurements indicated (<a href=\"#bib60\">Walker et al., 1991</a>); instead microtubules shrank slowly on average at 26 nm/s before catastrophe. This compared to a much faster depolymerisation speed of 480 nm/s after catastrophe. Our resolution allowed us to also measure slow shrinkage at the level of individual microtubules (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> top), yielding a similar mean shrinkage speed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The observed slow shrinkage agrees with the established view that in the presence of tubulin, growth results from the difference of fast tubulin association and slower dissociation events (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gardner et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Walker et al., 1988</a>); we observe the latter here directly for the first time. We also measured the nanometer-range distances that microtubules shrank between washout and catastrophe. These shrinkage lengths also tended to increase with growth speed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> bottom, \u03c1 = 0.51, p&lt;10<sup>\u20137</sup>), supporting the idea that faster microtubules are more stable, apparently due to longer stabilising caps.

EBs do not only report on the size of their binding region, but also affect the kinetic processes determining its size: they mildly increase microtubule growth speeds and accelerate the turnover of their own binding sites, effectively shortening the region they bind to (<a href=\"#bib40\">Maurer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Maurer et al., 2014</a>). Analysis of 139 microtubules showed that after tubulin washout, the mean delay time was now reduced approximately twofold to 3.5\u2009s (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), despite a mild increase of the growth speed to 33 nm/s (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, inset). Hence, binding of Mal3-GFP reduces the momentary microtubule stability, reminiscent of the EB-induced stimulation of catastrophes at steady state (<a href=\"#bib36\">Komarova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Maurer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mohan et al., 2013</a>).

This suggests that a threshold may have to be reached to induce catastrophe, raising the question of what exactly constitutes this threshold. Two extreme possibilities can be envisaged: A minimal total number of cap sites anywhere in the entire cap might be required for stability. Alternatively a minimal density of cap sites only at its very end where the cap site density is highest might be needed for stability of the cap. In other words, either the entire cap or only its highest density region could be critical for stability. These two scenarios predict different dependencies of the delay times on the growth speed and hence cap length (Materials and methods). To explore the momentary microtubule stabilities over a larger range of cap sizes, we performed tubulin washout experiments at a range of different tubulin concentrations from 10\u2009\u03bcM to 35\u2009\u03bcM, and at an increased magnesium ion concentration to further increase the velocity range (<a href=\"#bib46\">O'Brien et al., 1990</a>). In total 210 microtubules were analysed. As the growth speed distributions at different tubulin concentrations overlapped strongly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, top), we speed-sorted the data when calculating averages as a function of speed (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Maurer et al., 2014</a>). Average delay times extracted for seven speed groups from over 200 individual microtubule tracks displayed the expected positive correlation between delay times and growth speeds, however showing a weaker dependence especially for the higher speed range (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> bottom). This correlation was masked when displaying the delay times simply as a function of tubulin concentration (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), again emphasizing the importance of correlating delay times with momentary speeds in the presence of growth fluctuations."

The longer the caps at washout, i.e. the faster microtubules grow, the less dependent the momentary microtubule stability becomes on cap length. This is because EB site maturation becomes more important relatively to end shrinkage for reaching the 'end density' threshold, with increasing cap length at washout. In contrast, an alternative model assuming that catastrophe occurs when a critical 'total number' of sites anywhere in the cap (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <i>N</i><sub>crit</sub>) is reached did not agree with the data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, dashed line): this model predicts a stronger increase of delay times with growth speed for longer caps as a consequence of increasing total EB binding site numbers with cap length at washout."

This region could be accounted for by a two-step end maturation process consisting first of fast generation of EB binding sites, and a subsequent slower maturation into lattice sites. Applying this more complex model here did not improve the quality of the fits (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and confirmed that the threshold of stability is defined by a critical end density of cap sites and not by a critical total number of cap sites (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). In the absence of Mal3, the 2-step maturation model predicted threshold values for the end density that were ~25% larger compared to the simpler 1-step model. In the presence of Mal3 the two models predicted the same threshold value (within error) due to the first maturation step being very fast in the presence of EB1 family proteins (<a href=\"#bib41\">Maurer et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, the conceptually simpler end maturation model is sufficient to capture the basic principles determining momentary microtubule stability, especially for the more physiological condition in the presence of an EB1 family protein."

Here, using sudden tubulin removal, we directly investigated for the first time the relationship between the size of the protective cap and the momentary stability of individual microtubules. We found that faster growing microtubules have longer EB caps and are more stable after tubulin washout.

This indicates that the momentary microtubule stability fluctuates as growth speed varies and that EB caps store a 'memory of stability' over the time scale of several seconds, probably as a consequence of the lifetimes of the EB binding sites being in this range. The observation of this memory excludes memoryless models of microtubule dynamics (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bayley et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bolterauer et al., 1999</a>; ).

These findings further support the view that end binding proteins of the EB1 family may have evolved to modulate the stability of the functionally essential protective end structure of the microtubule and may then have gained the additional function to recruit a variety of other unrelated plus end binding proteins (+TIPs), whereas in parallel more effective, for example ATP-dependent modulators of cap stability such as depolymerases of the kinesin-13 family evolved (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brouhard and Rice, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Duellberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gardner et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Howard and Hyman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Maurer et al., 2012</a>)."

A unique advantage of this approach is that all major parameters of microtubule dynamics (growth rate, duration of the pause between the removal of tubulin and the catastrophe, depolymerization rates) are obtained for specific microtubules that are continuously monitored throughout the experiment. The quality of the data is excellent. The main conclusion is that microtubules are protected by a long cap delineated by the binding of EB. The length of the cap positively correlates with the growth rate and the ability of microtubule to remain stable in the absence of free tubulin. Importantly, the data presented in the manuscript suggest that these correlations have not been observed in previous studies due to rapid fluctuations, the size of the cap needs to be measured right before the catastrophe. This is an excellent paper whose publication in <i>eLife</i> is strongly recommended."

                    "text": "As suggested, we have re-examined our existing data. Our fitting software allows us to extract the orientation of the analysed microtubules. Although our experiment was designed in a way that microtubules are aligned with the flow during growth to minimise mechanical stress of the microtubules, we nevertheless quantified the variability in the orientation of the microtubule end regions with respect to the flow direction (the flow cells were manually aligned so that their long axis was parallel to the x-axis of the camera chip). For all three data sets presented in the manuscript we determined the angles of microtubule orientation and found that they were within +/-10 degrees of the flow direction. Plotting the delay times as a function of orientation for all data sets demonstrated convincingly that there was no correlation between angle and delay time. Any potential mechanical strain introduced during fluid exchange is expected to be larger for larger angles; hence, we can conclude that within the range of microtubule orientations of our experiment, there is no evidence of mechanical strain affecting the observed momentary microtubule stabilities (delay times between tubulin washout and catastrophe). We present scatter plots of the delay times vs. the 'raw' orientations for all datasets in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and added a corresponding description of this new analysis to the Results, to the Methods and to the legends. For the benefit of the reviewers, we also add scatter plots for the tubulin concentration dataset (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) showing the delay times vs. the magnitude of the average orientations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1A</a>), and of the delay times vs. the standard deviations of the orientation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1B</a>) (each orientation is an average over 10 s before tubulin washout). All scatter plots show that there are no correlations, demonstrating that the observed differences in delay times are not caused by mechanical stress. We thank the reviewers for suggesting this analysis and consider this an interesting new result that has strengthened our conclusions."

We state this more clearly now in the Discussion. We state that the fast tubulin washout experiments as performed here will be an interesting and powerful method to test different ageing models.

In <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, we now show these fits applying the 2-step model to all three datasets in comparison to the fits using the 1-step model. Importantly, using the 2-step model confirms the conclusion that the <i>end density</i> and not the <i>total number</i> of binding sites defines the threshold of stability. Two models make similar predictions, essentially because the first (A) region is typically short, see Maurer et al., Curr Biol. 2014. We extended the description of the 2-step model fits in the Results section and added a section to the Methods explaining how the analysis was performed. We feel that the manuscript is more accessible if we continue to focus on the 1-step model throughout and explain under which conditions the predicted thresholds need to be adjusted when the 2-step model is applied. These adjustments are rather minor, essentially because in the 2-step maturation model the first step is always faster than the second step, especially in the presence of EB proteins, as we found previously (Maurer et al., Curr Biol 2014). This means that under more physiological conditions (presence of EBs), the first step of the 2-step model can be neglected, leaving us with a 1-step model. In the absence of EBs (only relevant for some in vitro experiments), we found previously for very fast growing microtubules that the first step is predicted to be ~5x faster than the second step. In this case (absence of EBs), the 2-step model predicts ~25% higher threshold values of stability in the tubulin washout experiment than the 1-step model does. Conceptually, we do not consider this change as very important, especially given that this range is close to the experimental errors and/or observed variability in the data. Nevertheless, we agree that it is important to clarify these points."
