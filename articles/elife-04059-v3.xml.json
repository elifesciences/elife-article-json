By combining current-clamp measurements of electrophysiological properties with multi-variate analysis (hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis), we were able to characterize the postnatal development of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons' electrical phenotype in an unbiased manner, such that subtle changes in phenotype could be analyzed. We show that the intrinsic electrical phenotype of these neurons follows a non-linear trajectory reaching maturity by postnatal day 14, with two developmental transitions occurring between postnatal days 3\u20135 and 9\u201311. This approach also predicted which parameters play a critical role in phenotypic variation, enabling us to determine (using pharmacology, dynamic-clamp) that changes in the leak, sodium and calcium-activated potassium currents are central to these two developmental transitions. This analysis enables an unbiased definition of neuronal type/phenotype that is applicable to a range of research questions."

By combining current-clamp measurements of electrophysiological properties with multi-variate analysis (hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis), we were able to characterize the postnatal development of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons' electrical phenotype in an unbiased manner, such that subtle changes in phenotype could be analyzed. We show that the intrinsic electrical phenotype of these neurons follows a non-linear trajectory reaching maturity by postnatal day 14, with two developmental transitions occurring between postnatal days 3\u20135 and 9\u201311. This approach also predicted which parameters play a critical role in phenotypic variation, enabling us to determine (using pharmacology, dynamic-clamp) that changes in the leak, sodium and calcium-activated potassium currents are central to these two developmental transitions. This analysis enables an unbiased definition of neuronal type/phenotype that is applicable to a range of research questions."

In turn, passive and active properties define the way the neuron produces or processes information, that is, its electrical phenotype. An important question we are facing as neurophysiologists is how to characterize the electrical phenotype of a neuronal type in the most unbiased manner, such that we can then study subtle variations in this phenotype under varying conditions (development, perturbations, disease). In the current study, we propose an approach based on the combination of current-clamp measurements and multi-dimensional analysis of the measured electrophysiological properties, which allowed us to characterize and precisely quantify developmental changes in the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta."

These variations in activity patterns are associated with a modulation of dopamine release such that, for instance, immediate early gene activation is triggered only by bursting patterns of activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kitai et al., 1999</a>). From a biophysical point of view, regular tonic activity seems to rely mainly on SNc dopaminergic neuron intrinsic conductances while both irregular and bursting patterns necessitate the release of various neurotransmitters (glutamate, acetylcholine) by SNc synaptic inputs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kitai et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Grace et al., 2007</a>). In vitro however, mature SNc dopaminergic neurons mainly display a regular tonic (also called pacemaker) firing behavior (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grace and Onn, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liss et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Seutin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Puopolo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guzman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Putzier et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tateno and Robinson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amendola et al., 2012</a>). The irregular pattern of spontaneous activity is observed in immature SNc DA neurons in vitro (postnatal days 9\u201316, P9\u2013P16) and seems to be due to transient spontaneous activation of T-type calcium channels (<a href=\"#bib54\">Seutin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cui et al., 2004</a>) and subsequent activation of calcium-activated potassium channels (SK) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seutin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wolfart and Roeper, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cui et al., 2004</a>). Finally, the spontaneous bursting pattern of activity is usually absent from mature SNc DA neurons in vitro, but can be observed in juvenile neurons (P15\u2013P21) and depends on the activation of NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mereu et al., 1997</a>), or can be promoted by pharmacological blockade of T-type calcium channels and SK potassium channels (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wolfart and Roeper, 2002</a>)."

In the current study, we have performed a detailed analysis of the development of the intrinsic properties of SNc dopaminergic neurons over the first four postnatal weeks (from P2 to P29). We measured 16 electrophysiological parameters, exhaustively characterizing the passive and active properties of SNc dopaminergic neurons. Applying multi-variate statistical analyses (agglomerative hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis) to the measured electrophysiological parameters revealed that the acquisition of mature regular pacemaking involves biphasic changes occurring mainly during the first two postnatal weeks: intrinsic electrophysiological maturity is essentially reached by the end of the second postnatal week. In addition, this type of analysis allowed us to determine the participation of specific ion currents (leak, sodium and calcium-activated potassium currents) to changes in the global electrical phenotype. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of postnatal development of the intrinsic properties of SNc dopaminergic neurons and demonstrates the utility of high-dimensional electrophysiological characterization associated with multi-variate analysis methods to precisely define quantitative changes in electrical phenotype and to investigate the underlying biophysical mechanisms."

                                "text": "Several studies have suggested that bursting and irregular firing patterns are controlled in part by the calcium-activated potassium channels (SK1-3) responsible for the medium afterhyperpolarization (AHP) following APs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seutin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wolfart et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wolfart and Roeper, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cui et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Johnson and Wu, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Vandecasteele et al., 2011</a>). In SNc dopaminergic neurons, it was demonstrated that SK channels determine the regularity of spontaneous activity (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seutin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wolfart et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cui et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Vandecasteele et al., 2011</a>), and that AHP developmental increase correlates with the disappearance of irregular firing (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vandecasteele et al., 2011</a>). Since our recordings were performed using 10 mM EGTA in the intracellular solution, we wondered whether the resulting calcium chelation could inhibit SK channel activation and thus modify spontaneous activity patterns (favoring irregular or bursting firing patterns). We therefore performed two types of control experiments. In the first series of experiments, we reduced the intracellular EGTA concentration to 0.5 mM (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). In spite of the reduced calcium chelation, all firing patterns observed in 10 mM EGTA were also present in 0.5 mM EGTA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, the average CV<sub>ISI</sub> values were not statistically different between both EGTA concentrations (p = 0.201, n = 80 for 10 mM, n = 34 for 0.5 mM, unpaired <i>t</i> test; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) when measured in neurons of the same developmental stage (P18\u2013P22). Since the AHP can be influenced by calcium chelation and is involved in defining CV<sub>ISI</sub>, we also verified that AHP amplitude was not significantly modified by changes in EGTA concentration (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>): the mean AHP amplitude was not statistically different between both EGTA concentrations in P18\u201322 neurons (p = 0.129, n = 100 for 10 mM, n = 28 for 0.5 mM, unpaired <i>t</i> test; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). As 0.5 mM EGTA could still be considered as a calcium chelation condition that could significantly modify firing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grace and Bunney, 1984b</a>), we also verified that the three types of firing observed in whole-cell recordings in 0.5 mM EGTA or 10 mM EGTA were also present in cell-attached recordings. As demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, the firing patterns observed in 0.5 mM EGTA whole-cell recordings were found to be qualitatively similar to the firing patterns observed in cell-attached recordings in the same neurons before going whole-cell: regular, irregular, and bursting patterns were observed in cell-attached recordings. To ensure that whole-cell recorded firing patterns were also quantitatively similar to cell-attached recorded firing patterns, we compared the frequency of regular tonic firing in a subset of 33 neurons (P16\u2013P23) that were recorded both in cell-attached (before breaking into the neuron) and in whole-cell 10 mM EGTA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This analysis revealed that ISI<sub>avg</sub> was not altered by the whole-cell recording configuration (p = 0.898, n = 33, paired <i>t</i> test; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Therefore, the activity pattern and activity level are not significantly altered by the recording conditions, and the developmental transition between the different types of firing patterns cannot be explained by the recording conditions."

In order to describe the developmental evolution of AP shape, we measured six properties defining the different phases of the AP recorded during spontaneous activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>): AP threshold, AP rise slope, AP decay slope, AP half-width, AP amplitude, and AHP amplitude. Except for AP threshold, which was found to not vary significantly during the first four postnatal weeks (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), most AP features were found to present significant modifications over the same developmental timeframe (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

In this table, each major cell (plain black line surrounding) corresponds to one developmental stage, and the 16 minor cells constituting each major cell correspond to the electrophysiological properties presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7</a>.

Although this table only represents independent uni-variate analyses of the changes in each firing property, the stacking of the statistical differences provides a first visual impression of where important transitions in electrophysiological behavior occur: a first transition occurs between P2\u20133 and P5 while a second transition occurs between P8\u20139 and P12\u201313 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Therefore, the second transition was less clearly defined, spanning several of the developmental stages analyzed (a small number of statistical differences are still present between P10\u2013P11 or P12\u2013P13 and later stages). Outside of these transition phases, most electrophysiological parameters remain constant (between P5 and P8\u20139, then between P14 and P28). Although the stacking of uni-variate analyses gives a good indication of when major transitions are occurring, it still fails to easily and rapidly identify which properties most significantly change during the two transitions."

In order to confirm this hypothesis and determine the key/important changes in properties involved, we performed agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) analysis. We chose to include only the 8 electrophysiological parameters that can be extracted from the recordings of spontaneous activity (ISI<sub>avg</sub>, CV<sub>ISI</sub>, AP threshold, AP amplitude, AP rise slope, AP decay slope, AP half-width, and AHP amplitude) and excluded the parameters that require current injection to be measured (R<sub>in</sub>, C<sub>m</sub>, \u03c4<sub>m</sub>, sag amplitude, rebound delay, GS, GE, SFA index), the goal being to determine whether phenotype can be accurately defined with minimal electrophysiological manipulation (no current injection). Using AHC with an automatic setting of the dissimilarity threshold (XLSTAT software), the 263 recorded neurons were separated into three classes of heterogeneous sizes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The observation of the recordings corresponding to the central objects of each class reveals that bursting, irregular and regular tonic neurons were clustered in separate classes (class 1, 2 and 3, respectively; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Unsurprisingly, CV<sub>ISI</sub> was one of the parameters presenting the most significant differences between the central objects (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) or the centroids (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) of each class. Nonetheless, other parameters such as AP half-width, AP rise slope, AP decay slope, and AHP amplitude also presented notable differences between the three classes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Although age was not included as one of the variables in the AHC analysis, the age of the animals corresponding to each recorded neuron was known such that we were able to determine the age of each observation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), of the central objects (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) but also the mean age for each class (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Consistent with the developmental timecourse of firing pattern depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, the mean ages were P3.5, P7.44, and P17.32 for class 1, 2, and 3, respectively (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

To do so, we plotted the PC1 and PC2 factor loadings of the three classes identified by the AHC. Consistent with the AHC results, the three classes were found to cluster in distinct regions of the PC1/PC2 space (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Since AHC classes were found to be associated with specific developmental stages (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) and clustered in separate regions of the PC1/PC2 space, we wondered whether PCA could give more specific insights into the developmental trajectory of the electrophysiological properties of SNc dopaminergic neurons. Although age was not included as one of the parameters of the PCA, the mean PC1 and PC2 values and the associated standard deviations were calculated for each developmental stage analyzed, and could be represented in the PC1/PC2 space (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>): the distribution of values demonstrated that the developmental trajectory of the electrophysiological properties of SNc dopaminergic neurons is composed of two distinct phases, a first phase where PC1 and PC2 simultaneously decrease (between P2\u20133 and P5\u201311) and a second phase where PC1 keeps on decreasing while PC2 increases (between P11 and P15) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C1</a>). Interestingly, PCA also reveals that the electrophysiological behavior of SNc dopaminergic neurons in vitro reaches a steady state by P14\u201315, and that no significant change is observed after this stage, although some variability in the electrophysiological properties might still be present (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C2</a>).

In particular, since the mean electrical phenotype reaches a steady-state by P14\u2013P15, we tried to determine whether this stabilization was also associated with changes in the variability of the phenotype. Since PCA involves a normalization step, standard deviations of the PCs can be used as an index of variability (using the coefficient of variation is meaningless in this case): the error bars representing the standard deviations of the PCs in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> already suggest that variability in phenotype is higher for immature classes (1 and 2) than for the mature class (3). In order to quantify the variability for each developmental stage, we extracted the values of the standard deviations of PC1 and PC2 (SD PC1 and SD PC2, respectively) for each developmental stage presented in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, and considered that the overall variability in phenotype could be illustrated by the changes in the surface area of the ellipse defined by these two values (A = \u03c0 \u00d7 (SD PC1) \u00d7 (SD PC2); <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). This analysis showed that phenotype is more variable at early than late developmental stages. Consistent with this analysis, and since PC1 accounts for \u223c65% of the variance of our observations (<i>vs</i> \u223c28% for PC2), the standard deviation of PC1 was found to be significantly and negatively correlated with age (r = 0.802, p &lt; 0.001, n = 15).

A steep increase in the amplitude of the AHP is also observed between these two stages (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Since the apamin-sensitive calcium-activated potassium current responsible for the AHP has been linked to firing regularity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ping and Shepard, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wolfart et al., 2001</a>), and a sudden decrease in R<sub>in</sub> might explain changes in the properties of the AP (especially its amplitude), we tested whether the manipulation of these two parameters could reproduce the phenotypic transition observed between P2\u2013P3 and P5\u2013P7. Unfortunately, it is not possible to accurately simulate the increase in apamin-sensitive AHP occurring between P2\u2013P3 and P5\u2013P7 using dynamic-clamp, because of the calcium-dependence of this conductance. On the other hand, apamin very specifically blocks these conductances and simulates a decrease in AHP. Therefore, P7\u2013P8 neurons were recorded, and apamin application (100 nM, to block 75\u201380% of the AHP; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wolfart et al., 2001</a>) and injection of a dynamic clamp-generated negative leak conductance (average \u22120.55 nS, to simulate the increase in input resistance) were used in an attempt to reverse their electrophysiological phenotype to the P2\u2013P3 stage. As expected, apamin application induced a decrease in AHP (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>, <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) associated with an increase in CV<sub>ISI</sub>, corresponding to a switch from regular to irregular firing (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Artificially increasing R<sub>in</sub> by the injection of a leak negative conductance amplified the apamin effect, resulting in the appearance of burst firing (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>), consistent with the results obtained by <a href=\"#bib42\">Paladini et al. (1999)</a>. However, artificially subtracting leak before apamin application failed to induce a significant change in phenotype (CV<sub>ISI</sub> = 30% vs 27% before and after leak subtraction, respectively, n = 2). In order to determine whether these manipulations were able to precisely mimic the developmental transition, the PCA factor loadings corresponding to the neurons in control, apamin, and apamin\u2014leak conditions were plotted in the PCA space (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). This analysis demonstrated that apamin application and leak subtraction induced an electrophysiological regression of P8 neurons to a P2\u2013P3 phenotype (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B,E</a>), each isolated manipulation accounting for roughly 50% of the change in electrophysiological phenotype. The analysis of the changes in the individual electrophysiological properties also supported this conclusion (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We first demonstrate that SNc dopaminergic neurons switch from bursting to irregular to regular spontaneous activity pattern during the first three postnatal weeks. Using univariate analysis of 16 electrophysiological parameters (AP measurements, passive properties, excitability, etc\u2026) and multivariate analyses (AHC and PCA) of 8 electrophysiological parameters, we demonstrate that the postnatal electrophysiological development of SNc dopaminergic neurons involves two major transitions occurring between P3 and P5 and between P9 and P11, respectively, and that mature in vitro electrophysiological behavior (regular pacemaking activity) is essentially attained by P15. Using pharmacology and dynamic-clamp, we then demonstrate that the two developmental transitions can be precisely reproduced by distinct manipulations of passive and active properties, suggesting heterogeneous timecourses of development of the underlying ion channels. This study thus proposes a comprehensive approach to (i) precisely define neuronal electrical phenotype, (ii) quantify its changes during development (or in varying conditions), and (iii) investigate the biophysical mechanisms underlying phenotypic changes."

Our results extend these observations by showing that an additional intrinsic pattern of activity, a bursting pattern, can be observed in acute slices from neonatal rats (before P8). As demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, SNc DA neurons switch from bursting to irregular and regular activity over the first three postnatal weeks, these transitions corresponding to a non-linear monophasic drop in the coefficient of variation (inversely proportional to activity regularity) of the interspike interval. While bursting activity had been previously observed in vitro in response to glutamatergic receptor agonists (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mereu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Johnson and Wu, 2004</a>) or pharmacological blockade of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) currents (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wolfart and Roeper, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Johnson and Wu, 2004</a>), we demonstrate that SNc dopaminergic neurons are purely intrinsic bursters at very early stages of development, independent of the recording condition (cell-attached, whole-cell, EGTA concentration). Interestingly, a very recent study using calcium imaging demonstrated that a significant proportion of SNc dopaminergic neurons intrinsically generate calcium spikes or calcium plateaus between E16 and P0, while this calcium activity strongly decreases by P7 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ferrari et al., 2012</a>). Since bursting behavior usually relies on the activation of calcium conductances (<a href=\"#bib9\">Destexhe and Sejnowski, 2003</a>), including L-type calcium channels in SNc dopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib28\">Johnson and Wu, 2004</a>), our observation that most SNc dopaminergic neurons at P2\u2013P3 are intrinsic bursters corroborates the findings of <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferrari et al., (2012)</a>."

In several systems including the retina and the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moody and Bosma, 2005</a>), spontaneous waves of activity early in development have been shown to participate in network development/synaptic refinement. Calcium has a central role in this process, and the patterns of activity observed in these systems (synchronized bursts of action potentials) promote intracellular calcium rises (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moody and Bosma, 2005</a>). While midbrain dopaminergic neurons already project to the striatum at embryonic stage E16 and release dopamine at E18 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferrari et al., 2012</a>), the refinement of their projections continues at least until P0 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hu et al., 2004</a>), and it is likely that this pruning involves calcium-dependent mechanisms.

In fact, SK currents have been demonstrated to control the regularity of spontaneous activity in SNc dopaminergic neurons from both juvenile and mature animals in vitro (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ping and Shepard, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wolfart et al., 2001</a>). Moreover, SK current activation seems to be essential to the regular tonic pattern of activity as blockade of SK currents, under specific experimental conditions, induces a switch to a bursting pattern of activity, both in vitro (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wolfart and Roeper, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Johnson and Wu, 2004</a>) and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib66\">Waroux et al., 2005</a>). To summarize these observations, although irregular juvenile activity seems to involve the activation of SK conductances (via T-type calcium currents), the \u2018mature\u2019 regular tonic pattern of activity also relies on the strong activation of these same conductances."

In conclusion, our results and the published literature suggest that the gradual switch between bursting, irregular and regular intrinsic activity is at least partly due to a developmental increase in the amplitude of SK currents, or at least of the SK-mediated AHP. These results are also consistent with a recent study that demonstrated that spike frequency adaptation (SFA) in SNc dopaminergic neurons depends on SK currents, and that SFA decreases between P6 and P21 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vandecasteele et al., 2011</a>), an observation also made in the current study (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

Consistent with these observations, our measurements show that membrane capacitance is fairly stable after P10\u2013P11. Moreover, our data seem to indicate that membrane capacitance is also fairly stable, at lower values, between P2\u2013P3 and P8\u2013P9. Input resistance, however, shows a different developmental profile, with a very sudden drop between P2\u2013P3 and P5, and then a gradual decrease until P10\u2013P11. Therefore, the detailed sampling of early developmental stages seems to indicate that the morphology-related passive properties of SNc dopaminergic neurons reach maturity by the middle of the second postnatal week (P10\u2013P11), extending previous morphological measurements (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tepper et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Park et al., 2000</a>)."

In particular, AP amplitude and AP rise slope decrease from P2 to P5\u2013P7, then increase to reach a steady-state by P11\u2013P15. So far, previously published studies on SNc dopaminergic neurons have described more classical changes in these parameters over the same time range, that is, a monophasic increase in amplitude associated with an increase in AP rise slope (or the subsequent decrease in AP half-width) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Washio et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferrari et al., 2012</a>), although fewer developmental stages and smaller samples were analyzed compared to the current study. Nevertheless, previous studies dedicated to mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus development described the same type of monophasic increase in amplitude and acceleration of the AP (<a href=\"#bib37\">McCormick and Prince, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Spigelman et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Picken Bahrey and Moody, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Williams and Sutherland, 2004</a>). One of these studies demonstrated that it was due to an increase in the amplitude of the transient sodium current over the first two postnatal weeks (<a href=\"#bib44\">Picken Bahrey and Moody, 2003</a>), consistent with the role of this current in defining the rise kinetics and the amplitude of the AP (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bean, 2007</a>)."

                                "text": "Several factors could explain the biphasic timecourse observed in the current study. First, the analysis of passive properties demonstrated that the electrotonic size of SNc dopaminergic neurons suddenly increases between P2\u2013P3 and P5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), mainly due to a drop in input resistance. Such a drop in input resistance, in the absence of concomitant changes in sodium channel number, would cause a sudden decrease in the ability of sodium currents to depolarize the neuron, and could explain the drop in AP amplitude and AP rise slope. Other morphological changes could also explain these biphasic changes in AP properties. For instance, it is known that the axon initial segment (AIS), the main site of AP initiation, is located at highly variable distances from the soma (between 0 and 250 \u00b5m) in mature SNc dopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hausser et al., 1995</a>). Recent studies have demonstrated that mild changes in the location of the AIS can significantly influence the response of the neuron to sensory inputs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kuba et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2010</a>) or current injection (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grubb and Burrone, 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2010b</a>). Along the same line, and since P2\u2013P3 SNc dopaminergic neurons have a significantly smaller size than at later stages, one could hypothesize that these changes are associated with significant displacements of the AIS that would alter AP properties. However, this hypothesis would need further investigation."

While multivariate analyses such as PCA are designed to solve that problem by compressing the number of meaningful parameters (see next section), we propose an intermediate solution which consists of a visual stacking of the results of the uni-variate analyses performed on each parameter. Dimensional stacking entails visualizing a high-dimensional data set in a two-dimensional space and has been recently applied to analyze the electrical behavior of databases of complex realistic neuron models (<a href=\"#bib59\">Taylor et al., 2006</a>). In the current study, we performed ANOVA on 16 electrophysiological parameters across 14 developmental stages, thus, to compress the results into two visible dimensions, we (i) designed a two entry-table comprising 105 cells corresponding to all stage-to-stage comparisons (P2\u2013P3 vs P5, P2\u2013P3 vs P6, etc) (ii) divided each of these 105 cells into 16 sub-cells corresponding to the 16 electrophysiological parameters analyzed at each developmental stage, and (iii) color-coded the sub-cells as a function of the statistical significance of the ANOVA test performed (non significant, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001). As a consequence, although <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> strictly represents the results of separate univariate analyses, it also provides a general view of the changes in the electrical phenotype of dopaminergic neurons, since each cell summarizes the differences in 16 electrophysiological parameters between two specific developmental stages: while the evolution of 1 electrophysiological parameter can be tracked through development by looking at one specific sub-cell, looking at the mosaic pattern of the large cells gives an indication of the general change in electrophysiological phenotype. This type of stacked representation is likely to be useful to anyone analyzing changes in a large number of parameters across a large number of states, and is increasingly used when analyzing the behavior of databases of models (<a href=\"#bib59\">Taylor et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gutierrez et al., 2013</a>). In our case, the statistical stacking revealed two main transitions in electrical phenotype occurring between P2\u2013P3 and P5 and between P8\u2013P9 and P12\u2013P13, respectively."

This biphasic trajectory may indicate that the different voltage-dependent ion channels involved in the spontaneous firing pattern of SNc dopaminergic neurons reach their mature expression pattern with heterogeneous timecourses. Moreover, PCA also clearly reveals the stationarity of the electrical phenotype after P12\u2013P13 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C2</a>). Thus, the current study demonstrates that AHC and PCA can be used to precisely analyze the developmental trajectory of a specific population of neurons, and could be applied in the future to examine variations in neuronal electrophysiological phenotypes (eg., in disease states) and to criteria other than electrophysiological parameters."

With appropriate methods (for instance specific toxins and dynamic-clamp), it is then possible to modify the activity of specific ion channels and measure their precise effect on phenotype (visualized in the PCA space). Using that type of approach, we were able to determine that the two developmental transitions can be explained by distinct combinations of changes in the activity of leak, sodium, and calcium-activated potassium currents. While the increase in calcium-activated potassium current is involved in both transitions, the first transition (P3 to P5) involves a dramatic concomittant increase in leak conductance whereas the second transition (P9 to P11) may rely on a concomittant increase in fast sodium conductance. Although we cannot conclude that these biophysical mechanisms are the only ones involved in these developmental transitions, our experiments demonstrate that manipulating these parameters quantitatively reproduces the changes in electrical phenotype observed between these stages (see <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>)."

In this theory, Waddington postulated the following, referring in particular to organ development: <i>\u2018In a canalised system of the kind we have been considering, trajectories starting from any point within a certain volume will converge to a single end point which is the corresponding steady-state\u2026\u2019</i> (<a href=\"#bib65\">Waddington, 1957</a>). This precisely describes what is occurring with SNc dopaminergic neuron's phenotype as defined in the PCA space: the variability in phenotype (and the corresponding region of the PCA space) is much larger at early developmental stages (P2\u2013P5) than at late developmental stages where all values cluster in a single point of space (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figures 9C</a> and <a href=\"#fig10\">10</a>).

Previous studies have shown that mature neurons generate highly similar patterns of activity using variable solutions of underlying conductances, commonly displaying twofold to fourfold ranges of expression/amplitude of ion channels/currents (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schulz et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goaillard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Taylor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amendola et al., 2012</a>). For instance, mature SNc dopaminergic neurons can generate regular tonic activity patterns of similar frequencies while displaying substantial differences in the amplitude and gating properties of I<sub>A</sub> and I<sub>H</sub> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amendola et al., 2012</a>). These findings may imply that immature neurons, showing heterogeneous phenotypes, display even larger variability in their underlying conductances. The developmental profiles of ion channel expression rapidly change over the first two postnatal weeks, as has been shown in many systems (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moody and Bosma, 2005</a>), including the SNc dopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib67\">Washio et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dufour et al., 2014</a>). Slight differences in the developmental timecourses of neurons (visible only at early developmental stages) would certainly exacerbate the cell-to-cell variability in expression of ion channels already observed in mature neurons, and would reveal even larger ranges of expression of ion channels in immature neurons."

Although certain neuronal types such as motorneurons or sensory neurons may have clearly identifiable functions, determining the information \u2018coded\u2019 by other neuronal types (such as the dopaminergic neurons analyzed in the current study) may be much more challenging and debatable. As long as we do not know what the function of the neuron is, we cannot determine which of its electrophysiological properties are the most critical to its function (AP shape, firing frequency, average membrane potential?). How can we then define a neuron's electrical phenotype? In the current study, we proposed one defensible approach, which consists of measuring as many electrophysiological properties as possible in the same individual neuron, and considering that the electrical phenotype of the neuron is defined in this high-dimensional space of parameters. The use of multi-variate analysis such as AHC and PCA then reduces the number of meaningful dimensions in order to obtain quantitative visualizations of phenotypic variations. This type of analysis is likely to become increasingly important as we move towards better defining neuronal types and phenotypes in an unbiased manner and understanding how these neuronal characteristics develop and are altered by perturbation and disease."

                                "text": "The interspike interval (ISI) and ISI coefficient of variation (CV<sub>ISI</sub>) were calculated from a minimum of 40 s of stable current-clamp recording (with no injected current) within the first 5 min of obtaining the whole-cell configuration. Action potentials (APs) generated during this period of spontaneous activity were then averaged and the AP threshold, peak amplitude, rise slope, decay slope, afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude (AP threshold to trough of the AHP), and the duration of the AP at half of the maximal height of the AP (AP half-width) were measured. AP threshold was defined as the membrane voltage value reached when the voltage first derivative rises to 5% of its peak amplitude. Rise and decay slopes correspond to the average slopes measured between 10 and 90% of AP amplitude during the rise and decay of the AP, respectively. Hyperpolarizing 1 s current pulses were injected to elicit a hyperpolarization-induced sag with an average voltage value of \u221285 mV at the end of the hyperpolarizing current step in each cell (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amendola et al., 2012</a>). To measure the passive membrane properties (\u03c4<sub>m</sub>, R<sub>in</sub>, C<sub>m</sub>), 0.5\u20131 s negative current pulses inducing small hyperpolarizations (&lt;10 mV) were used, ensuring that no hyperpolarization-activated voltage-gated current (I<sub>H</sub>) contaminated the voltage signal. Incremental 1 s depolarizing pulses were injected to elicit trains of APs, and the frequency vs current curve was generated for each cell. Since SNc dopaminergic neurons display adaptation or facilitation of firing frequency during sustained current pulses (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vandecasteele et al., 2011</a>), we determined the average gain value (Hz/100 pA) both for the first three and the last three APs generated during the pulse (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Therefore, gain at the start (GS) and gain at the end (GE) values were determined and the spike frequency adaptation index (SFA index) was defined as the ratio GS/GE. Dopaminergic neurons are unable to sustain firing for strong current injections, a phenomenon known as depolarization block (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tucker et al., 2012</a>). This results in saturating frequencies of firing when injecting increasing depolarizing pulses of current. Our analysis of gain was focused on the \u2018non-saturating\u2019 firing behavior of dopaminergic neurons, that is, on the responses to current pulses inducing sustained firing of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, gain values could be extracted by linear regression of the frequency/current curve (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Conductance definition for the leak subtraction was compiled and downloaded from the PC to a P-25M DSP board (Innovative Integration, Simi Valley, CA), which executes the conductance injection with a sampling rate of 40 KHz over a 2 V range with a resolution of 0.1 mV. The leak conductance was defined as having a reversal potential of \u221265 mV, and the absolute conductance value was adjusted in each neuron in order to reach an apparent input resistance of 1600 MOhm corresponding to the input resistance measured in P2\u2013P3 neurons."

Analysis was conducted using FitMaster v2x30 (HEKA Elektronik) and Igor Pro (version 6.0, WaveMetrics). Statistical analysis (performed according to data distribution) included: linear regression, unpaired <i>t</i> test, Mann Whitney, paired <i>t</i> test, one-way ANOVA and Fisher exact test for proportions, with a p value &lt;0.05 being considered statistically significant. Statistics were performed utilizing SigmaPlot 10.0 (Jandel Scientific, UK) and Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as box and whisker plots, with the box representing the median value, the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the whiskers representing the 10th and 90th percentiles. In box and whisker plots, all outliers are represented. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (AHC) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed using XLSTAT 2011 (Addinsoft, France). AHC dissimilarity level was calculated based on euclidian distance, and agglomeration was performed using Ward's method. The dissimilarity threshold used for defining the number of classes of objects was automatically set by the XLSTAT software. PCA was based on the covariance matrix (n) of the observations/variables table. Only the PC1 and PC2 (accounting for 93.76% of the total variance) were kept, and the corresponding factor loadings (F1 and F2) for each individual recording were analyzed and plotted. Experiments where the effects of TTX, apamin and leak negative conductance injection on firing were tested (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>) were added as supplementary data in the PCA but were not included in the calculation of the principal components."

This is a careful, well-executed and well-written study of the electrophysiological development. While multiple previous studies have examined a few electrophysiological properties of this neuron type across development, the current study is distinct in providing: 1) comprehensive characterization of numerous sub- and suprathreshold properties, and 2) multivariate analyses of the developmental changes. In particular, these multivariate analyses (coupled with pharmacological and dynamic clamp manipulations) provide a novel, quantitative understanding of the electrophysiological development of the dopaminergic neurons, including generating hypotheses for how these developmental changes depend on underlying conductance densities. The writing is clear and the figures are well-structured and contain the necessary data. The conclusions are in general well justified in the data. The three reviewers, while coming at the paper from different perspectives have shared concerns that the authors should address."

The figures are beautiful in their content and clarity, and the data are extremely convincing. I cannot say the same about the Title, which I find boring and unexciting. My enthusiasm is somewhat deflated by the authors' general presentation of the work, however. As it reads, I see a methods paper, while the conceptual novelty in it is underemphasized: you have applied these sophisticated analysis methods to a high-dimensional characterization of neuronal activity, and with this you have established 3 basic post-natal developmental stages. As the Discussion states, these were basically known, but you have refined the transition points and the features that best characterize these states. From these, and here is the most novel part from the biological point of view perhaps, 3 ionic currents have emerged as the best candidates to explain these transitions. I think that this is important work, but as I said, this should be portrayed in a broader light. The prediction from this analysis that multiple currents are involved in this transition is important but relegated to the end of the Abstract and as a secondary point (\u201cThis approach also predicts...\u201d) and discussion. Previous work from the senior author suggesting the importance of recording many parameters from each neuron or preparation given the large variability observed in each parameter is relevant here but not mentioned. Isn't that the context where this work comes from? Also, I assume that you would predict that if I recorded from 300 adult basal forebrain cells, or leech interneurons (or any preparation), I should be able to extract the existence of subtypes that may otherwise not be known, or are only assumed to exist based on less rigorous protocols. It would be important to indicate this explicitly."

These analyses already revealed that electrophysiological maturity was reached by P14 and that electrophysiological phenotype was stable from then on.

Calcium is a central actor of this process, and the patterns of activity observed in these systems (synchronized bursts of action potentials) promote intracellular calcium rises (Moody, Physiol. Rev. 2005). While midbrain dopaminergic neurons already project to the striatum at embryonic stage E16 and release dopamine at E18 (Ferrari, Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2012; Hu, J. Comp.

As it reads, I see a methods paper, while the conceptual novelty in it is underemphasized: you have applied these sophisticated analysis methods to a high-dimensional characterization of neuronal activity, and with this you have established 3 basic post-natal developmental stages. As the Discussion states, these were basically known, but you have refined the transition points and the features that best characterize these states. From these, and here is the most novel part from the biological point of view perhaps, 3 ionic currents have emerged as the best candidates to explain these transitions. I think that this is important work, but as I said, this should be portrayed in a broader light. The prediction from this analysis that multiple currents are involved in this transition is important but relegated to the end of the Abstract and as a secondary point (\u201cThis approach also predicts...\u201d) and discussion. Previous work from the senior author suggesting the importance of recording many parameters from each neuron or preparation given the large variability observed in each parameter is relevant here but not mentioned. Isn't that the context where this work comes from? Also, I assume that you would predict that if I recorded from 300 adult basal forebrain cells, or leech interneurons (or any preparation), I should be able to extract the existence of subtypes that may otherwise not be known, or are only assumed to exist based on less rigorous protocols.
