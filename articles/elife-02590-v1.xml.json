Predicting the future state of the world from the present is critical for flexible behaviour, allowing us to move beyond reflexive reactions and instead towards charting a course that minimises punishment or improves our chances of reward. We routinely link cues (e.g., coffee starts to brew) and outcomes (coffee is ready) that are separated by seconds, minutes, or longer. At the cellular level, learning involves making changes to the strength of the connections between neurons, but these changes are only triggered when two neurons are active within about 100 milliseconds of each other (<a href=\"#bib7\">Levy and Steward, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Feldman, 2012</a>). Thus, there is an apparent mismatch between the timescales for behavioural learning and neural plasticity."

One possibility is that it prolongs neuron firing in some way, maintaining the neural signal from the initial cue. Several regions of the brain, most notably the frontal cortex, show persistently elevated neural activity while animals hold information in their short-term memory (<a href=\"#bib4\">Funahashi, 2006</a>). However, simply sustaining neural activity does not carry information about how much time has passed."

Noise correlations between CA1 cells increased early in training, suggesting that their inputs from CA3 were the site of the neural changes driven by learning (<a href=\"#bib9\">Modi et al., 2014</a>). While correlations mostly decreased again later in training, they remained high among the CA1 cells responding at the same time point, further suggesting that their final time-selectivity depends on a common source in CA3."

It will be important to understand whether these diverse contexts share common principles for generating sequences of neural firing. Since sequences are generated internally in the brain, independently of external input, identifying the region where they arise is a major goal. The findings of Modi, Dhawale and Bhalla further this effort by implicating area CA3 as this source in a task that depends solely on time."

In spatial learning tasks, suppressing the CA3 output demonstrates that it contributes to the initial formation of new place fields, and so determines the location where CA1 place cells fire (<a href=\"#bib10\">Nakashiba et al., 2008</a>). Similar approaches could help further define CA3\u2019s role in learning about time intervals as well. Finally, while the delay period used here was less than a second, we often face time contingencies spanning much more extended intervals. A major remaining challenge will also be to understand how the brain tracks delays on very long timescales\u2014such as those needed for publishing scientific papers."
