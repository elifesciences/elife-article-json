To get some insight into this question we ask how the connectivity patterns are organized at two successive synaptic relays in a simple, cholinergic efferent pathway. We found that the organization at successive relays in the parasympathetic nervous system strongly resemble each other despite the different embryological origin and physiological properties of the pre- and postsynaptic cells. Additionally, we found a similar developmental synaptic pruning and elaboration strategy is used at both sites to generate their adult organizations. The striking parallels in adult innervation and developmental mechanisms at the relays argue that a general strategy is in operation. We discuss why from a functional standpoint this structural organization may amplify central signals while at the same time maintaining positional targeting."

To get some insight into this question we ask how the connectivity patterns are organized at two successive synaptic relays in a simple, cholinergic efferent pathway. We found that the organization at successive relays in the parasympathetic nervous system strongly resemble each other despite the different embryological origin and physiological properties of the pre- and postsynaptic cells. Additionally, we found a similar developmental synaptic pruning and elaboration strategy is used at both sites to generate their adult organizations. The striking parallels in adult innervation and developmental mechanisms at the relays argue that a general strategy is in operation. We discuss why from a functional standpoint this structural organization may amplify central signals while at the same time maintaining positional targeting."

This idea has been influential in our understanding of the developmental alterations occurring in sensory systems, exemplified by the landmark studies of Hubel and Wiesel in the developing visual system (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wiesel and Hubel, 1965</a>). In the visual system, the evidence suggests that there are alterations in connectivity throughout the visual pathway between the\u00a0retina and visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Regehr, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shatz, 1990</a>). Notably, the segregation of ocular dominance columns in layer IV of primary visual cortex is thought to have a parallel in the development of monocular strips in the dLGN nucleus of the thalamus. This segregation of left and right eye input may be essential for depth perception via inter-ocular image disparity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barlow et al., 1967</a>). Because both axonal remodeling events are activity dependent it is possible that similar developmental mechanisms are driving them both."

Indeed, perhaps the most detailed analysis of developmental reorganization has been undertaken for motor axonal innervation of muscle fibers. It remains unclear, however, what purpose synapse elimination serves in efferent systems. If synaptic reorganizations occur at multiple stages of the same efferent pathways, it is possible that as in sensory systems these reorganizations segregate inputs for some intended purpose. If so, it is possible that an outgoing pathway may have coordinated changes taking place at successive synaptic relays."

To address this question, we chose to study the organization of axonal arbors in the part of the parasympathetic nervous system that controls salivary secretions via the submandibular gland. This parasympathetic outflow provides innervation to glands by way of ganglion cells, which are peripherally located cholinergic neurons clustered in ganglia and located near the submandibular gland. The submandibular ganglion axons (often called postganglionic axons) course relatively short distances to innervate their peripheral gland targets. The ganglion cells themselves are innervated by central nervous system axons (called preganglionic axons) that exit the brainstem and arborize in the peripheral ganglia."

Moreover, virtually nothing was known about the way postganglionic axons arborize in the gland and whether these arbors also reorganize during development."

Inter-axonal segregation in other parts of the nervous system requires either a high degree of chemo-specificity (e.g. retinotectal innervation; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fujisawa, 1981</a>), chemo-repulsion (e.g. tiling of sensory fields, <a href=\"#bib32\">Sagasti et al., 2005</a>), or competition mechanisms (e.g. synapse elimination in the neuromuscular system; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gan and Lichtman, 1998</a>). However, none of these phenomena were known to be associated with the innervation of glands. To better understand the cause of the inter-axonal segregation we wished to learn if parasympathetic axons directly contacted other axons at the edges of their territories, which might occur if there was contact inhibition between axons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Sagasti et al., 2005</a>). We reconstructed a volume of the gland parenchyma at high resolution using an automated serial section scanning electron microscopy approach (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kasthuri et al., 2015</a>). About 500 serial sections (~35 nm in thickness and 45 \u00d7 45 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> in area) were imaged to reconstruct axons and their targets. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, we found that the salivary gland parenchyma peripheral to the larger striated ducts contains three major cell types: (1) acinar cells, which have small eccentric nuclei and cytoplasm filled with extensive endoplasmic reticulum (<a href=\"#bib39\">Terasaki et al., 2013</a>), along with numerous large vacuoles presumably containing saliva (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>); (2) epithelial cells of the intercalated ducts (\u2018duct cells\u2019) that form the lumens that collect salivary secretions from the nearby acinar cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>); and (3) the myoepithelial cells which grow along the surfaces of both acinar and intercalated duct cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The myoepithelial cells have complicated shapes and appear to blanket acinar and duct cells. Because there are electrical junctions between acinar and duct cells and myoepithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ihara et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kater and Galvin, 1978</a>) it is possible that the intercalated duct - acinar cell assembly operates as a functional unit. In addition, there are also axon fibers and vesicle and mitochondria filled profiles in the volume (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>)."

In the immediate vicinity are several intercalated duct cells (light blue), acinar cells (lavender), and myoepithelial cells (beige). The duct\u2019s lumen is white. There is one additional short axonal segment (light yellow, red arrrow), whose origin is not known. Synaptic vesicles were rendered three times larger than their original size for clarity."

Although we saw multiple different axonal processes near these glandular structures, only one axon was responsible for making all the synapses in this region (onto five acinar cells, six duct cells and several myoepithelial cells). This result was consistent with the impression of single innervation of the intercalated duct - acinar cell assembly from optical imaging. Because only one axon associated with several different myoepithelial, acinar and duct cells, we surmise that the intercalated duct - acinar cell assembly is indeed a functional unit under control of a single ganglion cell. The well-known idea that neurotransmitter diffuses over larger distances at autonomic end organ synapses may mean in addition that there is little functional significance to which specific member of the intercalated duct \u2013 acinar cell assembly is most proximal to the release site."

Consistent with this, we found that this line expressed in an extremely sparse way in postganglionic submandibular neurons (&lt;&lt;\u00a01%, and no expression in 2/3 of the salivary glands studied). The sparse expression allowed unambiguous assignment of axon branches to their originating cell soma (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We used confocal imaging to acquire the entire arbors of four neurons in P21 animals. Although these neurons did not have dendrites they had elaborate axons. Each neuron\u2019s axon showed a clumpy distribution of terminal branches (i.e. baskets) that were confined to relatively small portions of the gland (all a neuron\u2019s branches were within\u00a0~1% of the\u00a0flattened gland area; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The axons of each of the four ganglion cells elaborated on average 13.75 baskets (14, 14, 12, 15; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> asterisks). The basket terminals were typically not immediately adjacent to one another suggesting several different ganglion cell axons project to approximately to the same region, a result that is consistent with the data from retrograde and Brainbow labeling (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>).

We performed retrograde labeling using the NPS method (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tsuriel et al., 2015</a>) to gauge the areal extent of many postganglionic neuronal axonal arbors (n\u00a0=\u00a0192) in several ganglia during development (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>).

The most parsimonious explanation for this change is that postganglionic axons prune branches in the first several postnatal weeks, resembling changes known to occur in the motor neuron input to muscle (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tapia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Keller-Peck et al., 2001</a>) and in the preganglionic input to these post ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lichtman, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Coggan et al., 2004</a>). Pruning may be occurring asynchronously among the postganglionic axons because the size range of developing axons progressively shrank as the animal matured (standard deviation of the area was 0.165 mm<sup>2</sup> at P1 versus 0.016 mm<sup>2</sup> at P21; two tail p=0.0014; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

At P1 the axons had relatively unbranched termini and showed few basket-like terminals: 12/13 fluorescently labeled ganglion cell axons lacked any evidence of basket terminals whereas almost the entire arbor contained baskets at P21 (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). The basket shaped arbors emerged during the first postnatal week and were common by P7 (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). It appears axons extend branches into many neighboring territories at P1 (see inset <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). There are more non-basket axon terminals at birth than the total number of baskets plus non-basket endings later on (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This result suggests that there are three potential fates for the non-basket endings: some transform into baskets, some are pruned, and some are maintained. At P7 there are still unbranched termini (see blue inset <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and these may be stable because their incidence is unchanged at P21, the oldest age we studied (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

Moreover, the overlap of axonal arbors in the gland decreased during early postnatal life (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). We posit therefore that the adult pattern emerges by either of two developmental pruning mechanisms. First, axons could swap singly innervated territories during development so that all their terminal basket arbors are concentrated within smaller areas. Alternatively, axons could initially co-innervate the same targets and then through a process of competitive synapse elimination prune branches until each intercalated-duct acinar cell assembly is innervated by only one axon\u2019s terminal basket arbor. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used intrauterine viral delivery (see Materials and methods) to label ganglion cells and their axons different colors in early postnatal life (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). At P3 we found that boutons of multiple postganglionic axons overlapped extensively in the same regions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, asterisks). This overlap was also evident in P7 glands at non-basket terminal regions by comparing the distribution of one YFP labeled postganglionic axon with all parasympathetic boutons (stained with an anti-vesicular acetylcholine transporter antibody) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>). At P7 the baskets however, showed no intermixing among different parasympathetic axons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F\u2013H</a>). These results support the idea that loss of multiple innervation leads to the single innervation of intercalated duct - acinar cell assemblies."

Consistent with the Brainbow light microscopy results in which multiple different axons arborized within microns of one another (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), there were multiple axonal branches coming in close contact with an intercalated duct - acinar cell assembly (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, white arrow). Despite multiple axons in close proximity, we did not observe any axons that were in direct contact with each other and as in adults, we did not find evidence for a contact-mediated inhibition mechanism to be at play. In addition, clusters of synaptic vesicles can be seen along the branches of several different axons and these are in close proximity to the duct cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a>). Thus, non-basket axonal innervation to single intercalated duct \u2013 acinar cell assemblies appears to be derived from more than one axon in early postnatal development.

This result is analogous to what we described above for the axonal output of submandibular ganglion cells in the salivary gland. To describe the structural characteristics of presynaptic brainstem input to ganglion cells, we again used the <i>Thy1</i> YFP-H strain that also sparsely labels preganglionic axons. Because of the small number of labeled neurons in any one preparation (&lt;1 in 20 submandibular ganglion samples), we could reconstruct the entire axonal arbor of individual brainstem axons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). We observed that single axons established multiple basket endings, each on a different ganglion cell. These basket endings are consistent with previous serial electron microscopy reconstructions showing numerous synapses between the axonal boutons within a basket and the cell soma of a single submandibular ganglion neuron (<a href=\"#bib7\">Coggan et al., 2004</a>). Because rodent submandibular ganglion cells are mostly adendritic in adults, these baskets are therefore the anatomical correlate of the strong dominance of one synaptic input to each ganglion cell (<a href=\"#bib7\">Coggan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lichtman, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McCann and Lichtman, 2008</a>). Tracing out individual preganglionic axons showed that they did not, as a rule, innervate immediately adjacent ganglion cells. Rather their baskets were distributed in what appeared to be an unpredictable way among ganglion cells within a ganglion cell cluster (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> inset), a result that is consistent with systematic electrophysiological pairwise recordings from adult rodent submandibular ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lichtman, 1980</a>) . For example, the axon shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> elaborated 25 sporadically distributed baskets within two ganglion cell clusters of several hundred cells. This result was typical among the three axons that were reconstructed. This sporadic intermixed apportionment of preganglionic axons to establish strong innervation on multiple separated ganglion cells is similar to the appearance described above for postganglionic axon branches that project to a distributed series of end-organ assemblies in the salivary gland."

First, these axons were more highly branched so that preganglionic terminal arbors were in the immediate proximity of a greater number of ganglion cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> inset). If these branches are synaptic, then each neural unit would be larger at this age than in adults.

In this dataset, we reconstructed two adjacent ganglion cells. Both neurons had multiple dendritic processes unlike ganglion cells at P7 and older (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6B</a>). In addition, they were innervated by a large number (14 and 17) of separate axonal branches. Given the limited size of the reconstructed volume, it is possible that some of these branches originated from the same brainstem neuron. To estimate the likelihood of individual axons sending multiple branches into a volume that all innervate the same neuron, we analyzed the branching patterns of a fluorescently labeled preganglionic P3 axon using a technique similar to the one described in <a href=\"#bib20\">Kasthuri et al. (2015)</a>. Briefly, in the light microscopy dataset, we selected random sub-volumes with the same dimensions as the electron microscopy dataset that had at least one fluorescently labeled branch within it. For each of these we counted the number of discrete branches within the volume (see Materials and methods for details). We found that the vast majority of the sampled volumes contained only one branch (95.61%, or 9561 out of 10000) and the maximum number of branches was only 2 (in 10,000 iterations).\u00a0Therefore, the 14 and 17 branches we saw most likely represented the actual number of different innervating axons with a lower bound being about half those numbers."

We found that in the parasympathetic nervous system, the downstream innervation to salivary glands and the upstream innervation to ganglion cells had many similarities. First, in both parts of the pathway, target regions are innervated by only one axon. In the ganglion, the singly innervated targets are individual submandibular ganglion cells. In the gland, the singly innervated targets are multicellular intercalated duct - acinar cell assemblies. Second, in both parts of this pathway, axons form basket-like endings to encompass the targets they innervate. Third, in both parts of the pathway, individual axons establish multiple baskets that are spatially interdigitated with basket endings of other axons. Fourth, in both parts of this pathway, the single innervation emerges only after an earlier period when multiple axons co-innervate the same targets. Finally, in both parts of this pathway, the pruning process that removes this intermixing occurs during early postnatal life. The implications of these parallels are described below."

Because both the mechanism of synapse elimination and its purpose remain poorly understood, having the opportunity to examine this phenomenon in the context of an entire system potentially adds useful knowledge. First, we were surprised to find evidence of synapse elimination in the innervation of the gland end-organ, which to our knowledge has no precedent. This axonal reorganization in glands is the second known site (skeletal muscle being the first) where axonal reorganizations are taking place in targets that are non-neuronal. However, in glands, the target cells do not fire action potentials and use metabotropic muscarinic rather than ionotropic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ekstrom et al., 1999</a>). This is significant because the only skeletal muscles that ordinarily do not undergo synapse elimination are tonic muscle fibers that do not fire action potentials (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lichtman et al., 1985</a>). However, in experiments in which action potentials are blocked at reinnervated twitch neuromuscular junctions, synapse elimination apparently still occurs suggesting that action potential activity may not always be required (<a href=\"#bib9\">Costanzo et al., 2000</a>). The result described here in salivary glands argues that axon pruning in normal development can occur without sodium-based postsynaptic action potential activity. It is known that voltage-dependent calcium channels in postsynaptic targets also mediate early stages of synaptic competition among the cerebellar climbing fibers innervating Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kano et al., 2013</a>). A neurotransmitter-elicited calcium surge also occurs in myoepithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ekstrom et al., 1998</a>) raising the possibility that a calcium flux in the myoepithelial cells could play a critical role in the synaptic modifications in the gland."

This contrasts with the situation in skeletal muscle where individual muscle fibers are electrically disconnected with each other during the phase of synapse elimination, leading to relatively few instances where immediate adjacent muscle fibers are part of the same motor unit (<a href=\"#bib23\">Keller-Peck et al., 2001</a>)."

The axonal expression of fluorescent protein we describe shows that in adult animals each single brainstem axon focuses large numbers of synapses (baskets) onto each of a sporadically distributed cohort of ganglion cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Based on electrophysiology (<a href=\"#bib7\">Coggan et al., 2004</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib26\">Lichtman, 1977</a>) we know these ganglion cells are driven to threshold by only one input (presumably the source of the basket) and therefore we expect that the activity patterns of the cohort innervated by the same brainstem axon are synchronous with each other. In turn, each of these ganglion cells innervate via baskets in the gland, a cohort of intercalated duct\u2013acinar cell assemblies that are interdigitated with the targets of other ganglion cell axons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Our previous work shows that the gland projections of the cohort of ganglion cells driven by the same preganglionic axon are localized to a sub-region of the gland (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tsuriel et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, many neighboring baskets despite being innervated by different ganglion cells may nonetheless be activated at the same time by the virtue of the synchronous activity of a cohort of ganglion cells. This arrangement would lead to an anatomical unit of secretion wherein one preganglionic axon drives a potentially contiguous territory in the gland. Because the glandular architecture subdivides into lobules and this may allow secretions of one lobule which drain into the same striated duct (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) to be under control of a preganglionic neuron. Such a \u2018neuro-lobular\u2019 organization might be advantageous because activity in one brainstem preganglionic neuron could potentially produce salivary flow that overcomes the compliance of the ductal network (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ekstrom et al., 1998</a>) and thus reach the oral cavity. The same amount of innervation distributed more sporadically would be less effective. A similar issue arises in skeletal muscle where motor units (which synchronously drive many muscle fibers) are often restricted to sub-compartments of a muscle (<a href=\"#bib22\">Keen and Fuglevand, 2004</a>). The tension elicited by the simultaneous activation of a number of neighboring muscle fibers is more effective than the same amount of tension if distributed over a larger area because the coordinated local contraction overcomes the visco-elastic properties of muscle and tendon. In salivary glands then such a neuro-lobular unit may provide more salivary secretion for the same amount of neural activity. Examining the validity of the ideas raised by this work will require a set of physiological experiments that are now being devised."

In muscle, each motor unit is recruited asynchronously so that each neuron has a discrete effect on the muscle\u2019s tension. But in the gland, many ganglion cell neurons are activated at the same time by the same preganglionic neuron. We think there is one important advantage of trimming all but one neuron to each intercalated duct - acinar cell assembly and that is the total length of the axonal arbors. If synapse elimination did not occur in the gland, then each ganglion cell axon would likely retain small connections to many multiply innervated intercalated duct - acinar cell assemblies rather than strong input to a smaller number of postsynaptic targets."

A number of experiments show that synapse elimination occurs when the multiple inputs to the same postsynaptic target are asynchronously active (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib36\">Tapia and Lichtman, 2013</a>). If synapse elimination in the parasympathetic nervous system is also mediated by asynchronous activity, then the reorganization of the wiring of the peripheral part of the pathway (postganglionic input to gland targets) must occur before synapse elimination of the more centrally located preganglionic input to ganglion cells (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). To make this argument we imagine what would be the consequence had synapse elimination occurred in the opposite order: first in the preganglionics (as opposed to first in the gland). If ganglion cells became singly innervated before the gland targets did, then there would be multiple ganglion cells with identical activity (i.e., all activated by the same preganglionic axon) innervating the same gland targets. Because of their synchronous activity synapse elimination would not occur, resulting in multiply innervated gland targets (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, left). For example, experiments that synchronize motor axon activity patterns abolish synapse elimination (<a href=\"#bib13\">Favero et al., 2009</a>). But we observed singly innervated target cells arguing against this idea. Thus, we think that there is a peripheral to central maturation sequence. Evidence that is consistent with this view includes the following: first, basket-like endings are visible in the gland before basket-like endings are visible in the ganglion (preliminary data); second, the end of synapse elimination in the\u00a0ganglia of rodents occurs around 30 days postnatal, which is weeks after the anatomy of the gland stabilizes."

We assume that the brainstem neurons have different firing patterns at birth (hence presented in blue and red, respectively). The activity patterns of each ganglion cell at birth are thus different because they are each multiply innervated by preganglionic axons that have different synaptic strengths (hence at birth the ganglion cells are each shown in a different color). Analogously, because the gland targets are also multiply innervated, their activity patterns are each different (presented here in different colors). During early postnatal life, these axonal projections begin to be trimmed away. (Left) If synaptic pruning occurred earlier in the ganglion than in the gland (a central to peripheral sequence of maturation) then many ganglion cells would come to have identical activity patterns (by virtue of being singly innervated by the same preganglionic neuron; represented in blue and red, respectively) at a time when their target gland cells are still multiply innervated. Activity dependent competition in the gland could eliminate asynchronous inputs to gland cells (i.e. red and blue inputs to the same target) but could not lead to activity dependent competition between axons driven by the same preganglionic input (i.e. red vs. red or blue vs. blue inputs). This would prevent the emergence of singly innervated gland targets (the gland cells would either have two blue inputs or two red inputs but not only one axon). (Right) However because gland targets are ultimately singly innervated, it seems more likely that the maturation sequence starts in the gland and then progresses centrally. In this alternative, synapse elimination in the gland occurs first, resulting in activity dependent pruning of the inputs of all but one ganglion cell on each gland target. This simplification of circuitry in the gland is then followed by a\u00a0reorganization and simplification of innervation in the ganglion. This peripheral to central maturation could also extend further upstream into the CNS. Singly innervated ganglion cells and gland cells in the peripheral to\u00a0central scheme (right)\u00a0would result in a substantial reduction in axonal branches when compared\u00a0to\u00a0the central to peripheral scheme with identical activation precision from the brainstem (left;\u00a0see text for details)."

It is well known in efferent motor and autonomic systems that the number of neurons is regulated by retrograde neurotrophic signals from targets (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib31\">Purves and Lichtman ,\u00a01985</a>). It is also clear that evolutionary pressures alter peripheral aspects of a body (such as its size, shape, coloration) without equivalent alterations in the nervous system. From the perspective of gene expression, the nervous system evolves less quickly than other organ systems (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brawand et al., 2011</a>). Hence a somewhat static brain must accommodate a more rapidly evolving body. For this reason, early maturation of peripheral connections may allow more central parts of the nervous system to adjust (perhaps epigenetically) to evolutionary trends that change peripheral structures. We thus imagine that mutations that lead to bigger eyes (for night vision) or bigger salivary glands (for animals that may eat more roughage) can be accommodated by the nervous system without the necessity of concomitant mutations in more central parts. This idea is supported by classic experiments in the sensory system showing the capability of the nervous system to adapt to an intentionally implanted third eye in frogs or early removal of vibrissae (<a href=\"#bib8\">Constantine-Paton and Law, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Van der Loos and Woolsey, 1973</a>). We think that in the parasympathetic nervous system, the early peripheral maturation is probably utilized in the same way for more upstream reorganizations. Thus, as in sensory systems, where action potentials move from the periphery to the center, this efferent system, where action potentials move towards the periphery, also undergoes a peripheral to central wave of maturation."

Among different postnatal ages (from P1 to\u00a0&gt;30 days), YFP-H or YPF-16 mice were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal (IP) injection of pentobarbital (1.5 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), transcardially perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA; EMS, Hatfield, PA) in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PBS pH 7.4). The submandibular glands (left and right pairs) were then dissected out and further post-fixed (2%PFA) for\u00a0~1\u20132 hr. For preganglionics, because the frequency of YFP labeling was low (~1/20 animals), gland samples were screened for the presence of GFP expression in the lingual nerve under a fluorescent dissecting scope equipped with a long working distance high NA 0.45 zoom objective (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). After fluorescence identification, the glands were cleaned from the fat and connective tissue encasing them, and the GFP axons further enhanced by immunohistochemistry (see below). For postganglionics, the frequency of the YFP labeling was higher (~1/3 animals) however the native fluorescence is difficult to visualize due the thickness of the tissue, so the screening process was carried out after the glands were cleaned from the fat and the encasing connective tissue, followed by antibody amplification of the YFP signals (see below). Another <i>Thy1</i> CFP-D transgenic mouse line (<a href=\"#bib29\">McCann and Lichtman, 2008</a>) was also used to visualize three quarters of the postganglionic axons. They were processed in the similar fashion as described above as the anti-GFP antibody binds to CFP as well. <i>ChAT-Cre</i> mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME; Bradford Lowell) and are used for adeno-associated viral vector injection (see below)."

It provides new information on the adult organization of the parasympathetic innervation of salivary glands and the coordinated developmental changes in the innervation of the ganglion cells by preganglionic axons. The results from the light and electron microscopy and fluorescent-protein-expressing mice are beautiful and convincing. The discussion of the results has broad implications for how parts of the nervous system become connected to perform their tasks. This is a welcome study, as much of the attention in neuroscience has lately been upon mapping circuits in the CNS with little attention to the PNS. The reviewers do not feel that additional experiments are needed, however, some clarifications and minor revisions are in order."

We did not observe postsynaptic densities and it is likely that neurotransmitter have an effect that is longer range in comparison to classic synapses. Because the targets that become singly innervated are multicellular units it is possible that the longer-range effects of neurotransmitter would still largely activate the same intercalated duct-acinar cell assembly. In the following question (#2) a similar query is raised. We have now added a sentence (subsection \u201cGanglion cell axons innervate intercalated duct cells, nearby myoepithelial cells and occasionally acinar cells\u201d, second paragraph) to clarify this. Despite this difference synapse elimination leading to single innervation seems to occur at this non-classical site. We feel that calling these junctions synapses (as do many other researchers) is appropriate but for clarity at the first use of the term synapse for postganglionic junctions we call them neuro-effector junctions, an alternate term for this site of neurotransmitter release (see the aforementioned paragraph)."

One speculation is that if an axon were to degenerate, other axons could readily sprout from rather close distances to re-innervate the target cells that have become un-innervated. Another speculation is that if competition is based on activity then the outcome may be unpredictable and unique to each individual giving rise to arbitrary distributed innervation fields.

It appears that in all these cases these processes are innervated. How they are lost however is not well understood. We are quite familiar with work of Dale Purves on dendritic retraction following axotomy in sympathetic neurons. In that work the loss of dendrites seemed to be by retraction bulbs and gradual shortening. It is also the case that in these other systems during development there are frequently bulbs at the ends of these transient dendrites perhaps suggesting a similar mechanism of removal, but this is all speculation and omitted from the text."
