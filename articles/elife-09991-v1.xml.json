This coral reproductive event is one of earth's most prominent examples of synchronised behavior, and coral reproductive success is vital to the persistence of coral reef ecosystems. Although several environmental cues have been implicated in the timing of mass spawning, the specific sensory cues that function together with endogenous clock mechanisms to ensure accurate timing of gamete release are largely unknown. Here, we show that moonlight is an important external stimulus for mass spawning synchrony and describe the potential mechanisms underlying the ability of corals to detect environmental triggers for the signaling cascades that ultimately result in gamete release. Our study increases the understanding of reproductive chronobiology in corals and strongly supports the hypothesis that coral gamete release is achieved by a complex array of potential neurohormones and light-sensing molecules."

This coral reproductive event is one of earth's most prominent examples of synchronised behavior, and coral reproductive success is vital to the persistence of coral reef ecosystems. Although several environmental cues have been implicated in the timing of mass spawning, the specific sensory cues that function together with endogenous clock mechanisms to ensure accurate timing of gamete release are largely unknown. Here, we show that moonlight is an important external stimulus for mass spawning synchrony and describe the potential mechanisms underlying the ability of corals to detect environmental triggers for the signaling cascades that ultimately result in gamete release. Our study increases the understanding of reproductive chronobiology in corals and strongly supports the hypothesis that coral gamete release is achieved by a complex array of potential neurohormones and light-sensing molecules."

One of nature\u2019s greatest examples of synchronized behavior is the coral spawning that occurs on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The \u2018mass-spawning events\u2019 on the GBR is the Earth\u2019s largest reproduction event. During these annual events (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babcock et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Harrison et al., 2011)</a> changes in the intensity of moonlight trigger the spawning of more than 130 species of scleractinian corals as well as hundreds of other invertebrates over a couple of nights (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babcock et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>). Broadcast spawning requires coral colonies to carefully synchronize the release of egg and sperm into the water column in order to optimize fertilization success (<a href=\"#bib12\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Levitan, 2005</a>). Environmental factors, such as sea surface temperature, lunar phase and the daily light cycle, influence reproductive timing in coral and induce spawning (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babcock et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Babcock et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Harrison et al., 1984</a>).

The phase of the moon, on the other hand, coordinates the timing of mass spawning, selecting neap tides that reduce gamete dilution in the water column (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babcock et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Babcock et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Mendes and Woodley, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Willis et al., 1985</a>). Spawning occurs a few days after the full moon and at a precise time after sunset, although the time of day and night(s) on which spawning and gamete release occurs is highly species-specific. In addition to being influenced by moonlight (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babcock et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Harrison et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Glynn et al., 1991</a>), the timing of spawning is thought to be regulated by the onset of darkness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babcock et al., 1986</a>), the duration of regionally calm weather (<a href=\"#bib31\">van Woesik, 2010</a>), food availability (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fadlallah, 1981</a>), twilight chromaticity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sweeney et al., 2011</a>), and salinity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jokiel, 1985</a>). How these exogenous factors function together with endogenous mechanisms in corals to achieve mass spawning harmonization is unknown."

                        "text": "To elucidate the role of natural moonlight phases and the effect of \u2018light pollution\u2019 on mass spawning synchronization, 16 large <i>A. millepora</i> colonies were collected from the Heron Island reef flat (GBR, Australia) and transferred to large outdoor aquaria, which were exposed to natural sunlight, moonlight and flow-through seawater from the reef flat. Coral colonies were exposed to one of the following treatments: ambient (maintained under ambient conditions of daylight and moonlight, N=6), light (illuminated using artificial light, low intensity ~ 5\u00a0\u00b5mole quanta m<sup>-2</sup>\u2009s<sup>-1</sup> daily from sunset to midnight, then kept in the dark until sunrise, N=5), or dark (covered with a black shade from sunset to sunrise to block moonlight, N=5) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) beginning 8 days prior to the spawning night. We sampled corals from all treatments during the days leading up to the spawning event at midday, at moonrise and at hourly intervals during the spawning night after sunset; this included sampling of released gametes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). During the spawning night, colonies exposed to ambient conditions spawned in a similar manner to those on the reef (gametes were released at approximately 21:30\u201322:30); however, no sign of spawning behavior occurred in either the light or dark treatments. For ambient corals, we identified 184 transcripts that were only variable during the spawning day and showed a clear change in expression (mostly induction) just prior to and at the time of gamete release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>); however, such changes were not observed in corals that were kept in the dark (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Colonies exposed to the light treatment showed a mismatch of gene expression profiles, and the expression of the genes that were highly variable during spawning occurred prematurely (around sunset at 18:15 and 19:30, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Moreover, these colonies did not release gametes, implying that \u2018light pollution\u2019 disrupted spawning synchronization. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that coral transcripts, which were only variable during spawning, were enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) processes of the cell cycle, GTPase activity and signal transduction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). An analysis of transcripts that were highly up-regulated or down-regulated during spawning showed a larger proportion of transcripts (177) that increased their expression levels during spawning (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), a substantially smaller portion of 29\u00a0transcripts that were down-regulated (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and no correlation with gene expression profiles from the released gametes. Fifty four out of the 177 up-regulated genes, and none of the 29 down-regulated genes, were also found to be variable during the spawning day (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The up-regulated coral genes were enriched in G protein-coupled processes, signal transduction and respiratory processes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Down-regulated genes were enriched in processes which generate and maintain rhythms in the physiology of organisms (rhythmic processes) such as circadian clock related genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and included some additional genes, which were not clustered. A qPCR validation (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>) of both up-regulated and down-regulated genes showed strong correlation between the qPCR and RNA-seq data based on log<sub>2</sub> fold change measured on the spawning night in ambient conditions at 19:30 versus 22:00 (r<sup>2</sup>=0.92, p&lt;0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Furthermore, specific classes of G-proteins can be activated by opsins in response to light in coral larvae (<a href=\"#bib16\">Mason et al., 2012</a>). Neuropeptides are another diverse class of signalling molecules that act through G-protein coupled receptors. These peptides have been implicated in an array of biological processes such as reproduction, metabolism, feeding, circadian rhythms, adaptive behaviors and cognition (<a href=\"#bib9\">Grimmelikhuijzen and Hauser, 2012</a>). The importance of neuropeptides in life phase transitions has been recorded across a range of taxa such as annelids, cnidarians, insects and mammals (<a href=\"#bib25\">Schoofs and Beets, 2013</a>). Our results indicate that gamete release from a broadcast spawning coral is potentially controlled by a series of G-protein-coupled signalling pathways and that the trigger for release might be a non-visual ocular photoreceptor such as the melanopsin-like coral homolog and/or a range of neuropeptide candidates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Genes induced during spawning included two melanopsin (opn4b)-like homologs, a battery of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and a homolog of synaptotagmin 7 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Melanopsin (Opn4) has been shown to be required for light-induced circadian phase shifting in mammals (<a href=\"#bib21\">Panda, 2002</a>). Given the broad changes in expression patterns in GPCRs and their potential triggers, it seems that neuropeptide signalling appears to be central in controlling gamete release in broadcast coral spawning, where such a simple nervous system likely evolved in an ancestor common to all cnidarians (<a href=\"#bib9\">Grimmelikhuijzen and Hauser, 2012</a>). Our data are consistent with the activation of GPCR receptors and consequent GPCR signalling cascades followed by changes in cell migration (eg, RAP2B, UNC5D, IF2B1), immunity/cell death (eg. TLR2, TLR6, TRAF5, DAB2P, FAK1, NLRC5) respiration (NU4M, NU5M, COX1, NDUA4, CYB) and cytoskeletal organization (eg. PAXI, INF2, NUP43) which together lead to synchronized gamete release (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

The sequential expression pattern of these melanopsin-like homologs, however, suggests that they are important for signalling events during mass spawning in corals regardless of whether they convey a light, pheromone or other signal. The discovery of potential neuropeptide/GPCR-coupled signalling mechanisms are consistent with neurohormones playing a role in synchronized spawning events in tropical abalone (<a href=\"#bib36\">York et al., 2012</a>) and in the settlement behavior of coral larvae (<a href=\"#bib8\">Grasso et al., 2011</a>).

In this respect, only colonies exposed to ambient light conditions at night spawned. We further tested the concept of light regime changes causing a mismatch in the timing of gamete release through another experiment in which <i>A. millepora</i> colonies were exposed to treatments where the length of the day was extended artificially (between sunset and midnight), through exposure to a suite of light quantity and quality regimes. We found that colonies exposed to ambient conditions and treatments with light sources in the red light region (620\u2013700 nm) of the spectrum spawned at 21:30, which was synchronous with <i>A. millepora</i> colonies spawning in the field. However, colonies exposed to light in the green (500\u2013620 nm) and blue (400\u2013500 nm) regions of the spectrum and to PAR (400\u2013700 nm) at low-dim, medium and high light intensities phase shifted their spawning time by a 6\u20138\u2009hr delay or spawned 2 nights later as compared with colonies under ambient conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Our results suggest that detection of light in the blue and green parts of the spectrum is important for gamete release, which is congruent with suggestions that blue light detection is a key element for coral spawning behavior (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gorbunov and Falkowski, 2002</a>) and evidence that <i>A. millepora</i> larvae settle more readily under blue and green light as compared with red light (<a href=\"#bib26\">Strader et al., 2015</a>).

Small branches were cut from the central portion of each colony prior to specimen collection to confirm pink-coloured eggs, which are present when a colony is reproductively mature (<a href=\"#bib11\">Harrison et al., 1984</a>). Four of the colonies were transported close to the shore but were left in the field on the reef flat (treatment F). The remaining 16 colonies were transferred to large, outdoor flow-through aquaria and were exposed to natural sunlight, moonlight and flow-through seawater from the reef flat. Colonies in the outside aquaria were divided into the following three treatments: ambient (A), in which the colonies (N=6) were exposed to natural day and night cycles and full exposure to moonlight; light (L), in which the colonies (N=5) were exposed to natural daylight during the day and to artificial PAR light (~5 \u00b5mol quanta m<sup>-2</sup>\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>) post\u00a0sunset every day for ~6\u2009hrs between 18:15 and 24:00 and then left in the dark until sunrise; and dark (D), in which the colonies (N=5) were exposed to natural daylight during the day and left in the dark between 18:15 and sunrise. The experiment was conducted at Heron Island Research Station in an area that was maintained in darkness at night to avoid artificial light contamination from non-experimental sources. Branches from colonies were collected from each of the three treatments on 4 d (November 10, 12, 14, and 15, 2011) leading up to the spawning night (November 16,\u00a02011) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

The release of gametes occurred between 21:30 and 22:30, and the colonies in the Ambient treatment began to show signs of setting at 19:30. We also sampled released gametes from colonies in the Ambient treatment. Sampled coral branches were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C until processing for total RNA extraction.

On average, ~10 million single-end reads were obtained for each sample of the full moon and new moon conditions, and ~15 million paired-end reads were obtained for each sample in the spawning experiment.

Only reads that were aligned to the protein coding regions of the <i>A. millepora</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Moya, 2012</a>) were used.

Primers were designed from RNA-seq data using the Primer Express Software v3.0 (Applied Biosystems, USA). Total RNA (1000 ng) was reverse transcribed with a SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Transcript levels were determined via qPCR assays using an Eppendorf 5075 (Applied Biosystems, USA) robot to dispense SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, UK) into 384-well plates, and assays were run in a 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The PCR conditions included an initial denaturation for 10\u2009min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009s and 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. Finally, a dissociation step included 95\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, 60\u00b0C for 15\u2009s and 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009s. The final reaction volume was 10 \u00b5l and included 300 nM of primers. All reactions were carried out with two technical replicates (which showed no difference in expression levels). For each candidate gene sample (from five replicates), the ambient colonies at 19:30 were tested against the ambient colonies at 22:00 on the spawning night. A no-template control and a no-reverse transcription control were performed for each gene and treatment to ensure that the cDNA samples and PCR reagents did not undergo DNA contamination. Additionally, to ensure the specificity of the primers for the coral cDNA, they were tested on cDNA and genomic DNA from <i>Symbiodinium</i> sp. as a template in a PCR. This procedure avoided any amplification of non-coral DNA. The comparative delta CT method (<a href=\"#bib33\">Walker, 2002</a>) and a maximal PCR efficiency for each gene (E=2) were used to determine the relative quantities of mRNA transcripts from each sample. Each value was normalized to two reference genes, adenosylhomocysteinase (AdoHcyase) and ribosomal protein L7 (Rpl7). The selection of reference genes for this experiment was performed using a pool of reference genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>) and analysing their expression stability via the geNorm software (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vandesompele et al., 2002</a>). For this study, the most stable expression was found for AdoHcyase and Rpl7 (M value=0.225), and a minimum of two reference genes was recommended (V2/3=0.102). The real-time dissociation curve was used to check for the presence of a unique PCR product. Relative expression values for each gene were calculated by showing a ratio of the relative expression at 22:00 over the relative expression at 19:30. The results of the qPCR and RNA-seq analyses are presented on a log<sub>2</sub> scale. A Welch t-test was used to test for significant differences in the expression levels (obtained via quantitative real-time PCR) of each gene at 19:30 compared with that at 22:00 (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>)."

Five colonies were placed into each aquarium, which were shaded during the day to simulate PAR levels at a 3-m depth. The coral colonies were acclimated to ambient seawater temperatures for 48\u2009hrs prior to the experiment. At night, the shading was removed after sunset to expose the corals to natural moonlight. We simulated later \u2018sunsets\u2019 to determine if light intensity and light spectra can phase shift-spawning time. The coral colonies were divided between aquaria exposed to the light intensity treatments (n=15) and light spectra treatments (n=10); the coral colonies were divided into three aquaria for each of the seven treatments. The coral colonies were irradiated with artificial light every day for 6\u2009hrs between 18:00 and 24:00 (midnight). These colonies also received the ambient light/dark cycle during the day. We tested three light intensities (100 [\u2018high\u2019], 50 [\u2018medium\u2019] and 0.75\u20131 [\u2018low-dim\u2019] \u03bcmole quanta m<sup>-2</sup>\u2009s<sup>-1\u00a0</sup>[using T8 fluorescent lamps]) and three light spectra (blue [400\u2013500 nm, Lee filter model, deep blue 120 40% transmission], green [500\u2013620 nm, Lee filter model, dark green 124 60% transmission] and red [620\u2013700 nm, Lee filter model, bright red 026, 80% transmission]). The light intensity was adjusted to 1 \u03bcmol quanta m<sup>-2</sup>\u2009s<sup>-1</sup> for all three light spectra using a neutral density filter (Lee filter model, neutral density 210 (0.6) 20% transmission) when needed. The light was measured using a LI-COR (LI-192S) light meter. As a control, we maintained another set of corals that were exposed to ambient light/dark cycles. The corals were divided into four large tables; the first table included the control tanks, the second the \u2018high\u2019 light intensity treatment, the third the \u2018medium\u2019 light and the fourth table the \u2018low\u2019 light treatment corals. At the ends of each table, we added another four tanks into which were projected the blue, green and red light spectra. To avoid any light \u2018leaks\u2019, black plastic screens were placed between the treatments. The experiment was conducted on a roof deck at the Heron Island Research Station to avoid artificial light \u2018contamination\u2019 and increase exposure to moonlight when the corals were not artificially irradiated. The experiment began on October 31, 2006 and ended on November 15, 2006. The corals were monitored at night each day after the full moon (November 5, 2006); moonrise began at 17:53, and moonset was at 04:22 (November 6). Each night, the corals were monitored between 18:00 and 03:00 or until spawning ceased. The times when the gamete bundles appeared in the polyp mouths (\u2018setting\u2019) were recorded, as well as the times at which the first and last gamete bundles were released into the water column. The data were analyzed based on the timing of gamete release. Spawning in the field for the same species was observed via snorkeling or scuba diving. The major spawning on the reef and in our control aquaria occurred on the night of November 13, 2006, which was 8 nights after the full moon night. After the spawning event on November 13, the corals were held in the aquaria and monitored for later spawning in the ambient light/dark cycles with no artificial light until November 15. At the end of the experiment, the coral colonies were returned to the Heron Island reef flat."

The authors provide evidence indicating that excessive light delays or prevents spawning. They also identify transcriptional changes during spawning that suggest molecular pathways that likely regulate spawning events. In conclusion, this is an important article that lays the foundation for future studies, including comparative studies with closely related species (2 <i>acroporas</i>, for example) whose time of spawning is different, and thus may allow finding the precise mechanism of time to spawning. The work is carefully performed and worthy of publication once the following revisions, indicated by the reviewers and outlined below, have been addressed."
