                    "text": "Molecular and cellular processes in neurons are critical for sensing and responding to energy deficit states, such as during weight-loss. Agouti related protein (AGRP)-expressing neurons are a key hypothalamic population that is activated during energy deficit and increases appetite and weight-gain. Cell type-specific transcriptomics can be used to identify pathways that counteract weight-loss, and here we report high-quality gene expression profiles of AGRP neurons from well-fed and food-deprived young adult mice. For comparison, we also analyzed Proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons, an intermingled population that suppresses appetite and body weight. We find that AGRP neurons are considerably more sensitive to energy deficit than POMC neurons. Furthermore, we identify cell type-specific pathways involving endoplasmic reticulum-stress, circadian signaling, ion channels, neuropeptides, and receptors. Combined with methods to validate and manipulate these pathways, this resource greatly expands molecular insight into neuronal regulation of body weight, and may be useful for devising therapeutic strategies for obesity and eating disorders."

Agouti related protein (AGRP)-expressing neurons are a key hypothalamic population that is activated during energy deficit and increases appetite and weight-gain. Cell type-specific transcriptomics can be used to identify pathways that counteract weight-loss, and here we report high-quality gene expression profiles of AGRP neurons from well-fed and food-deprived young adult mice. For comparison, we also analyzed Proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons, an intermingled population that suppresses appetite and body weight. We find that AGRP neurons are considerably more sensitive to energy deficit than POMC neurons. Furthermore, we identify cell type-specific pathways involving endoplasmic reticulum-stress, circadian signaling, ion channels, neuropeptides, and receptors. Combined with methods to validate and manipulate these pathways, this resource greatly expands molecular insight into neuronal regulation of body weight, and may be useful for devising therapeutic strategies for obesity and eating disorders."

                        "text": "Neurons that express <i>Agouti related protein</i> (<i>Agrp</i>) and <i>Proopiomelanocortin</i> (<i>Pomc</i>) comprise two intermingled molecularly defined populations in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) that mediate whole-body energy homeostasis in conjunction with other cell types. AGRP and POMC neurons positively and negatively regulate body weight, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>). AGRP neurons transduce circulating signals of energy deficit into increased output of the neuropeptides AGRP and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) as well as the neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), each of which contribute to increased appetite and body weight. Correspondingly, weight loss is accompanied by increased <i>Agrp</i> and <i>Npy</i> gene co-expression in AGRP neurons (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hahn et al., 1998</a>), as well as increased electrical activity (<a href=\"#bib73\">Takahashi and Cone, 2005</a>) and synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, during energy deficit, POMC neurons decrease electrical activity due to inhibitory synaptic input from AGRP neurons (<a href=\"#bib73\">Takahashi and Cone, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>), and <i>Pomc</i> neuropeptide gene expression is reduced (<a href=\"#bib68\">Schwartz et al., 1997</a>). AGRP and POMC neurons are thus both associated with sensing and counteracting energy deficit states. Because these neurons play major reciprocal roles in energy homeostasis, investigations of the molecular response pathways for AGRP and POMC neurons to weight-loss are critical for identifying key control points associated with regulation of body weight."

In light of this, a transcriptome-wide view of gene expression changes can provide a foundation for investigating the neuronal cell biology of these energy homeostasis sensing neurons during a state of energy deficit."

Recent approaches employing immunoprecipitation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in molecularly defined and even projection-specific populations (<a href=\"#bib33\">Heiman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dalal et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ekstrand et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allison et al., 2015</a>) require large numbers of cells, and therefore have been challenging to perform for neurons with small population sizes, such as AGRP and POMC neurons. A transcriptional profile of AGRP neurons has been obtained previously from dissociated tissue in which fluorescently labeled AGRP neurons were sorted and pooled from \u223c40 neonatal mice and compared to a similar number of neonatal AGRP neuron-specific <i>Foxo1</i> knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ren et al., 2012</a>). In neonatal mice, cells are readily dissociated, but AGRP neurons are not necessary for early neonatal life and their axons are not developed (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bouret et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Luquet et al., 2005</a>), thus, the relevance of neonatal gene expression patterns to those in adult mice is uncertain. Moreover, comparing only one sample from two conditions prevents statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG). Recent technical improvements in cell sorting and transcriptional profiling methods have enabled the generation of high quality gene expression profiles from small numbers of fluorescently labeled neurons (typically 40\u2013250 neurons) from single adult mouse brains (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sugino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Okaty et al., 2011</a>). Importantly, this permits use of individual animals as replicates for comparing gene expression profiles under different conditions, which is the approach that we used here."

These changes in gene expression allowed identification of coordinated signaling pathways that are involved in the response to food deprivation, and we focus here on neuropeptides, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as well as pathways associated with neuron electrical activity, circadian regulation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress signaling. This resource, which includes gene expression profiles for AGRP and POMC neurons as well as methods for validating and evaluating the functional significance of these changes, provides a foundation for in depth analysis of the molecular control points for neuron populations involved in energy homeostasis."

The Eif2ak3/PERK (AGRP: \u22122.1-fold, q = 0.23) arm of the UPR pathway is the first to be engaged during ER stress and suppresses translation of most mRNA. We expected that prolonged translational arrest in AGRP neurons was unlikely because it is inconsistent with elevated neuropeptide production in AGRP neurons during energy deficit. Activation of Eif2ak3/PERK leads to mRNAs sequestration into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles that aggregate into stress granules containing the RNA binding protein, TDP43 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Colombrita et al., 2009</a>). To assess stress granule formation, we used anti-TDP43 immunostaining. Elevated stress granule formation was not detected in AGRP neurons from FD mice (p = 0.76, ks-test, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>), which provides preliminary evidence that Eif2ak3/PERK-mediated translational arrest may not be engaged at this 24-hr food deprivation time-point.

In response to ER stress, Atf6 is subject to proteolytic cleavage and releases an N-terminal transcription factor domain that translocates to the nucleus and initiates gene expression to increase protein folding. To examine the extent of Atf6 nuclear translocation in the response of AGRP neurons to food-deprivation, we developed a Cre recombinase-dependent N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP):Atf6 fusion (<a href=\"#bib63\">Samali et al., 2010</a>) reporter of Atf6 cleavage for use in the brain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). After expression in AGRP neurons, we measured the nucleus:cytoplasm ratio of GFP, which was very low and was not significantly increased in FD vs ad libitum fed mice; whereas the ER-stress-inducer, tunicamycin, strongly increased nuclear localization of GFP in AGRP neurons (fed vs FD: p = 0.44, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vs tunicamycin: p = 2.9e<sup>\u221216</sup>, ks-test, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013J</a>).

GABA signaling is also important in AGRP neurons, and synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (<i>Sv2c</i>, +5.4-fold, q = 5e<sup>\u221210</sup>), which regulates the readily releasable pool (<a href=\"#bib80\">Xu and Bajjalieh, 2001</a>) is increased, as is <i>Snap25</i> (+2.1-fold, p = 1.5e<sup>\u22126</sup>), a key SNARE complex component responsible for vesicle fusion. Collectively, these changes in gene expression show some of the molecular underpinnings for processes that mediate increased AGRP neuron output in energy deficit due to alterations of excitatory synaptic inputs, synaptic plasticity, as well as elevated GABA and neuropeptide release."

Previous work has shown transient receptor potential C (TRPC) ion channel subunit expression in POMC neurons (<a href=\"#bib56\">Qiu et al., 2010</a>), which is confirmed by our RNA-Seq data, and we find that an overlapping set of TRPC channels (<i>Trpc1</i>, <i>Trpc3-Trpc7</i>) is also expressed in AGRP neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

One of the most striking changes in ion channel gene expression in AGRP neurons during food-deprivation was a sharp reduction of <i>Kcnn3</i> (also called <i>Sk3</i>, \u22125.4-fold, q = 0.0006), which is a small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK) that attenuates action potential firing rate during elevated activity. Other SK channels were not appreciably expressed in AGRP neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Electrophysiological characterization of AGRP neurons showed the presence of SK-mediated tail currents, confirmed by blockade with the highly selective SK channel antagonist, apamin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Notably, the apamin-sensitive SK conductance was absent in FD mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), consistent with reduced <i>Kcnn3</i> expression. Apamin blockade of SK channels in AGRP neurons resulted in higher firing rates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>), which often elicited bursts and plateau potentials (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Similarly, AGRP neurons from FD mice showed a comparable increase in excitability, but in this state the neurons were not sensitive to apamin, consistent with greatly reduced SK-channel expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, by starting from cell type-specific RNA-Seq analysis, we found that <i>Kcnn3</i> regulates firing rate as well as burst firing in AGRP neurons, and its reduction with food-deprivation plays an important role in increasing the excitability of AGRP neurons."

All significantly upregulated GPCRs were either G<sub>q</sub>-protein coupled (e.g., <i>Ghsr, Nmur2, Gpr83, Htr2a</i>, <i>Nmbr</i>, <i>Hcrtr2</i>) or G<sub>s</sub>-protein coupled receptors, several of which show high ligand-independent basal G<sub>s</sub>-protein activity (<i>Gpr3</i>, <i>Gpr6</i>, <i>Gpr64</i>). The most strongly downregulated genes were G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled receptors (<i>Npy2r</i>, <i>Hrh1</i>, <i>Hrh3</i>, <i>Htr1a</i>). Conversely, POMC neurons showed the opposite pattern with six differentially regulated GPCR transcripts where all upregulated genes were G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled (4/6) and the downregulated genes were G<sub>q</sub>- or G<sub>s</sub>-protein coupled (2/6).

To test the functional consequence of elevated <i>Gpr6</i> expression in AGRP neurons, we transduced <i>Agrp</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> mice with a Cre-dependent virus co-expressing <i>Gpr6</i> and a fluorescent protein (AGRP<sup>Gpr6</sup> mice; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013H</a>). AGRP<sup>Gpr6</sup> mice showed significantly elevated body weight compared to mice expressing a fluorescent protein alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). These experiments reveal a potential role for <i>Gpr6</i> and G<sub>s</sub>-coupled signaling in AGRP neurons for positive regulation of body weight."

The high number of DEG in our dataset is influenced by our study's greater statistical power, use of RNA-Seq (instead of microarrays), as well as high purity and more narrowly defined cell types. However, the relatively small number of DEG measured in POMC under similar experimental conditions indicates that the magnitude of changes in gene expression in AGRP neurons is also based on a selectively tuned response in these neurons to the energy deficit physiological state.

Wax-outlined tissue sections were immersed in Probe mix and incubated (2 hr, 40\u00b0C) in the HybEZ humidified incubator, rinsed in ACD Wash Buffer (2 \u00d7 2\u2032) then sequentially incubated in ACD proprietary reagents alternating AMP1-FL and AMP3-FL (30 min) with AMP2-FL and AMP4-FL (15 min) with two washes (2 min) between each step. Brain sections were then labeled with DAPI and coverslips were applied. Slides were stored at 4\u00b0C before image acquisition at 63\u00d7 using a Zeiss 710 confocal on an Axio Examiner Z1 upright microscope. Quantification of mRNA particles was performed on cell volumes obtained by maximal intensity projection of 5 mm of tissue acquired with a 63\u00d7 objective, using the StarSeach Java applet (<a href=\"http://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu/StarSearch/launch.html\">http://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu/StarSearch/launch.html</a>) with a threshold setting of 50."

Briefly, the authors manually sorted tagged AGRP and POMC neurons and subjected the cells to RNAseq analysis. Notably, they did this in fed and fasted mice. They provide a comprehensive assessment of gene expression changes, especially in AGRP neurons. They also provide some preliminary functional studies to support the functional significance of some of the changes observed in AGRP neurons. Overall, the studies are well performed and provide abundant novel information. Clearly, the results will be of wide interest. Although several other attempts have been made at collecting and dissecting the most useful transcriptomic information from hypothalamic circuits involved in body weight regulation, this study is offering additional value, mostly due to the scientific rigor applied throughout conceptualization and while conducting these experiments.

Moreover, we know that many people would want to see some of the lists that we proved: e.g. top 30 DEG, all POMC neuron differentially expressed genes (DEG), all GPCR DEG, etc. The colormaps that we provided give easy access to important information that we expect to be used by scientists in the field. However, we are concerned by the reviewers\u2019 critique that we have failed to organize or label these colormaps in an intuitive manner. We believe that the three most essential summary data for each category of gene expression are 1) mean expression level, 2) fold-change of expression level, 3) the q-value for differentially expressed transcripts. This is primarily what is shown in the colormaps, which are the most succinct way to represent these three types of summary statistics in a figure. We feel strongly that this information needs to be easily available to researchers.
