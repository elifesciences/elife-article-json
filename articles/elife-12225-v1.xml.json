However, the chemical mediators crucial to this process have not been fully elucidated. We reveal that a subset of NTS neurons containing cholecystokinin (CCK<sup>NTS</sup>) is responsive to nutritional state and that their activation reduces appetite and body weight in mice. Cell-specific anterograde tracing revealed that CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons provide a distinctive innervation of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), with fibers and varicosities in close apposition to a subset of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R<sup>PVH</sup>) cells, which are also responsive to CCK. Optogenetic activation of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> axon terminals within the PVH reveal the satiating function of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons to be mediated by a CCK<sup>NTS</sup>\u2192PVH pathway that also encodes positive valence. These data identify the functional significance of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons and reveal a sufficient and discrete NTS to hypothalamic circuit controlling appetite."
