However, others have argued there are bound to be errors, but that science is self-correcting and that the system is working (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bissell, 2013</a>). Where one stands on the matter depends partly on the size of the problem. In an effort to estimate how big the problem is, <i>eLife</i> has agreed to be the publisher for a project that will systematically assess the fraction of high-impact cancer studies whose major results can readily be reproduced."

The papers were not selected based on any controversy or suspicion that they are, or are not, reproducible.

One obvious concern is whether the laboratories that perform the replication studies on behalf of the Reproducibility Project have the expertise, experience and determination to successfully repeat the sometimes complex experiments described in the studies they examine. The Reproducibility Project has considered these issues and has promised to address them openly. It may not be perfect, but it is a credible effort to address an important question. Only time will tell whether the Reproducibility Project gets it right and whether its conclusions are ultimately sustained by independent studies."

As long as the laboratory cooperates with efforts to get to the bottom of the problem and to correct the scientific record, this is not bad science. This is how a self-correcting system should work. At the other end of the spectrum lie laboratories who don't let controls or contradictory data get in the way of a good story and who do not play a constructive role in correcting the scientific record when their data turn out to be irreproducible or incorrectly interpreted.

We can all think of research areas that were launched by high-profile papers with revolutionary ideas that were not carefully tested. In my own field of stem cell biology a series of high-profile studies around the year 2000 claimed that blood-forming and other stem cells transdifferentiate into cells belonging to developmentally unrelated tissues under physiological conditions. This led to an explosion of hundreds of studies that all claimed to observe transdifferentiation among tissues in a way that threatened our understanding of developmental lineage relationships and the regulation of fate determination. However, most of these studies turned out not to be reproducible (<a href=\"#bib10\">Wagers et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Balsam et al., 2004</a>), and the rare events that were reproduced were explained by cell fusion rather than transdifferentiation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarez-Dolado et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Vassilopoulos et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Wang et al., 2003</a>).

This scientific method is fundamental and yet is not always followed by scientists. Many scientists, like most humans, base their opinions and conclusions more on intuition than on careful experimentation and ignore the data that contradict intuitively attractive models. This is a major source of irreproducible results and of ideas that launch a thousand ships in the wrong direction. It is time to redouble our efforts to explicitly emphasize the scientific method when training graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty (<a href=\"#bib5\">Collins and Tabak, 2014</a>).

Some laboratories publish one irreproducible study after another in high-impact journals, collecting data to support their intuition, and paying little attention to whether or not the data truly support the conclusions. Anybody can make a mistake, but labs that repeatedly publish irreproducible results, and fail to engage with colleagues who are trying to resolve the inconsistencies, hold fields back.
