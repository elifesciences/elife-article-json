Here, we show that p38 MAP Kinase (MAPK) modulates this hypoxia response pathway in <i>C. elegans</i>. Mutants lacking p38 MAPK components <i>pmk-1</i> or <i>sek-1</i> resemble mutants lacking the hypoxia response component and prolyl hydroxylase <i>egl-9</i>, with impaired subcellular localization of Mint orthologue LIN-10, internalization of glutamate receptor GLR-1, and depression of GLR-1-mediated behaviors. Loss of p38 MAPK impairs EGL-9 protein localization in neurons and activates the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1, suggesting that p38 MAPK inhibits the hypoxia response pathway through EGL-9. As animals age, p38 MAPK levels decrease, resulting in GLR-1 internalization; this age-dependent downregulation can be prevented through either p38 MAPK overexpression or removal of CDK-5, an antagonizing kinase. Our findings demonstrate that p38 MAPK inhibits the hypoxia response pathway and determines how aging neurons respond to hypoxia through a novel mechanism."
