They are widely believed to be required for transporting hydrophobic odorants through an aqueous lymph to odorant receptors. We construct a map of the <i>Drosophila</i> antenna, in which the abundant Obps are mapped to olfactory sensilla with defined functions. The results lay a foundation for an incisive analysis of Obp function. The map identifies a sensillum type that contains a single abundant <i>Obp</i>, <i>Obp28a.</i> Surprisingly, deletion of the sole abundant <i>Obp</i> in these sensilla does not reduce the magnitude of their olfactory responses. The results suggest that this Obp is not required for odorant transport and that this sensillum does not require an abundant Obp. The results further suggest a novel role for this Obp in buffering changes in the odor environment, perhaps providing a molecular form of gain control."

They are widely believed to be required for transporting hydrophobic odorants through an aqueous lymph to odorant receptors. We construct a map of the <i>Drosophila</i> antenna, in which the abundant Obps are mapped to olfactory sensilla with defined functions. The results lay a foundation for an incisive analysis of Obp function. The map identifies a sensillum type that contains a single abundant <i>Obp</i>, <i>Obp28a.</i> Surprisingly, deletion of the sole abundant <i>Obp</i> in these sensilla does not reduce the magnitude of their olfactory responses. The results suggest that this Obp is not required for odorant transport and that this sensillum does not require an abundant Obp. The results further suggest a novel role for this Obp in buffering changes in the odor environment, perhaps providing a molecular form of gain control."

This result suggests that Obp28a is not required to transport odorants to the neurons in ab8; indeed, it appears that these neurons do not require an abundant odorant binding protein in order to respond to a scent.

The <i>Drosophila</i> antenna is covered with olfactory sensilla that fall into three main morphological classes: basiconic, trichoid and coeloconic sensilla (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shanbhag et al., 1999</a>). Basiconic sensilla detect many fruit odors (<a href=\"#bib16\">de Bruyne et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>); trichoid sensilla sense pheromones (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clyne et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dweck et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ha and Smith, 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib72\">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</a>); coeloconic sensilla detect organic acids and amines (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abuin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Benton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Silbering et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yao et al., 2005</a>). Each class can in turn be divided into functional types. For example, 10 types of basiconic sensilla, designated ab1 (antennal basiconic 1) through ab10, detect different subsets of odorants (<a href=\"#bib14\">Couto et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">de Bruyne et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Elmore et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Marshall et al., 2010</a>). Olfactory sensilla are perforated by pores or channels through which odorants can pass, and they contain an aqueous lymph in which the dendrites of up to four olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are bathed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Many sensilla contain two ORNs, designated A and B based on their spike amplitudes. Sensilla also contain a thecogen (sheath) cell, a trichogen (shaft) cell, and one or two tormogen (socket) cells. These cells produce the lymph and wrap around the ORNs (<a href=\"#bib64\">Shanbhag et al., 2000</a>)."

Previous work has not defined which Obps are expressed in individual sensilla, nor in which sensilla individual Obps are expressed. Thus it has been difficult to carry out well-defined manipulations of Obp content. Here we take advantage of a recent RNA-Seq analysis that quantified <i>Obp</i> expression in the antenna (<a href=\"#bib48\">Menuz et al., 2014</a>). We examine the expression of the abundant <i>Obps</i> at the level of sensillum morphology, sensillum functional type, and cell type. The results illustrate basic principles of olfactory system organization, and they allow construction of an Obp-to-sensillum map. The map identifies a sensillum type that contains only one highly expressed <i>Obp, Obp28a</i>. We delete this <i>Obp</i> gene and analyze the effects physiologically. Surprisingly, we find that deletion of the only abundant <i>Obp</i> in this sensillum type does not reduce the magnitude of its ORN responses. Additionally, we find evidence suggesting that this Obp plays a role not previously demonstrated for Obps, in buffering sudden increases in odorant levels. This Obp could provide a molecular mechanism of gain control that acts prior to receptor activation. Together, this work provides a foundation for incisive studies of Obp function, suggests that some sensilla do not require an abundant Obp for odorant transport, and encourages a broader view of the functions performed by the large and diverse family of Obps."

Six of the <i>Obps</i> were coexpressed with the tormogen marker (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). <i>Obp84a</i>, which showed strong labeling of thecogen cells, did not label tormogen cells. <i>Obp76a</i> did not label cells with either marker, suggesting that it is expressed in trichogen cells, a suggestion that we have been unable to confirm directly for lack of a suitable marker specific for trichogen cells in olfactory sensilla. Moreover, most of the <i>Obp</i> probes (including <i>Obp83a, Obp83b, Obp28a, Obp19a, Obp69a, Obp76a</i>) seem likely to be expressed in trichogen cells, based on the substantial number of cells they label in antenna sensilla that are not labeled by thecogen or tormogen markers; for example, <i>Obp83a</i> is not co-expressed with the thecogen marker (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) and labels many cells that are not labeled by the tormogen marker (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>).

The mutant also showed an accelerated decline in the firing level following the termination of a prolonged odor stimulus. The overall response profile to a panel of diverse odorants, however, was similar between the mutant and control. These results are interesting because they argue against some alternative models of Obp28a function. Specifically, in addition to transporting odorants, Obps have been proposed to protect odorants from degradative enzymes, to inactivate odorants following stimulus termination, or to filter them (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kaissling, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Leal, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Pelosi and Maida, 1995</a>). If Obp28a protected odorants in ab8 we would expect a greater initial response in the control than in <i>Obp28a</i> mutants. If Obp28a inactivated odorants at the end of the odor response, we would expect a faster decline in the control at the end of odor stimulation. If Obp28a selectively filtered certain odorants, we would expect differences in the response profiles of mutant and control. We note moreover that the similarity in response profiles is consistent with results from the empty neuron system. If Obp28a selectively filtered certain odorants, we would expect the Or35a receptor to confer a different odor response profile in basiconic sensilla, which express <i>Obp28a</i>, and in coeloconic sensilla, which do not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). By contrast, the response profiles of Or35a in the two sensillum types are very similar (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>)."

Obp28a is expressed in all basiconic sensilla, and could play a broader role than Obps expressed in only a subset of sensilla. One of the most intriguing aspects of Obps and sensilla is their diversity. Different Obps are likely to have different functions: there is evidence for reduction in olfactory function following reduction in the levels of certain Obps (<a href=\"#bib10\">Biessmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pelletier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Swarup et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Xu et al., 2005</a>), and another Obp has been found to contribute to the inhibition of neurons in the taste system (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jeong et al., 2013</a>). In this regard, we found that the most abundant Obp transcript in the antenna, <i>Obp19d</i>, is expressed in epidermal cells and not accessory cells, consistent with the findings of (<a href=\"#bib51\">Park et al., 2000</a>), and is thus unlikely to be secreted into sensillar lymph. It seems plausible that Obp19a binds ligands other than odorants, as may other Obps that are expressed outside the olfactory system (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arya et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pitts et al., 2014</a>). Not only are Obps highly diverse, but sensilla also are diverse in structure and function, as illustrated by the lack of visible pore tubules in trichoid sensilla of <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shanbhag et al., 1999</a>).

It is possible that following the sudden influx of an odor stimulus, some of the odorant binds to Obp28a, thereby reducing the amount available for receptor activation. After the termination of a prolonged stimulus, odorant released from the Obp-odorant complex might increase the level available for receptor binding. In both cases the Obp would buffer the system against sudden changes in odor level."

This gain control is believed to play a critical role in preventing network saturation and in improving odorant discrimination. It is possible that Obp28a provides an additional mechanism of gain control, which acts at the molecular level as opposed to the cellular level. This molecular form of gain control would precede the cellular form, occurring even before the odor receptor or the neuron were activated."

Male and female flies were anesthetized, placed in a collar, covered with OCT (Tissue-Tek, VWR, Radnor, PA), and frozen on dry ice. 14 \u00b5m antennal cryosections were collected on slides and stained as previously described (<a href=\"#bib48\">Menuz et al., 2014</a>). In brief, sections were fixed and acetylated at room temperature, pre-hybridized, and then incubated with DIG and/or FITC probes at 65\u00b0C overnight. Detection of probes was carried out with anti-DIG-POD or anti-FITC-POD in 1% Blocking Reagent (Roche) and amplified with Cy3 or Cy5 TSA (Perkin Elmer,\u00a0Waltham,\u00a0MA). GFP was detected with mouse-anti-GFP (Roche) and Alexa-fluor-488 donkey-anti-mouse antibodies (Invitrogen). All microscopy was performed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope and images were processed with ImageJ software."

Filtered AC signals (50\u20132000 Hz) were recorded and digitized with a Digidata 1440 digitizer and Axoscope 10.5 software (Molecular Devices). Action potentials were detected and counted using custom Matlab (MathWorks) scripts written by Carlotta Martelli (<a href=\"#bib46\">Martelli et al., 2013</a>), with few if any modifications. All spikes were counted due to difficulty in reliably sorting A and B neurons in ab8 sensilla. Impulse responses are defined as the firing rate during the stimulus period minus the baseline firing rate. Odors typically take 100 ms to reach the antenna, due to the length of the odor delivery tube, so the stimulus period is considered to start 100 ms after the opening of the odor delivery valve and persists for the length of the pulse, which in nearly all cases was 500 ms. The baseline firing rate was calculated by counting the number of spikes during the 500 ms period prior to odorant release. To generate dose response curves, each sensillum was tested with all concentrations of odor in ascending order of dose, and no more than 3 sensilla were analyzed per fly. ab8 sensilla were identified by their location and physical attributes and confirmed by their strong response to 10<sup>\u22123</sup> 2,3-butanediol (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>). Spikes for peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were binned in 50 ms intervals except that in the 30s stimulus paradigm they were binned in 1s intervals. Statistical significance was assessed using Prism\u2019s (GraphPad) two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post-hoc test. Values shown are the mean +/\u2212 SEM."

Baker (Center Valley, PA). Odorants of the highest grade available were used and were then diluted in paraffin oil (Fluka). For 500 ms pulses, 50 \u03bcl of diluted odorant was applied to a 13 mm filter paper disc inside a Pasteur pipette and capped with a 1 ml pipette tip to create an odor cartridge. Cartridges were allowed to equilibrate for 20 min before use. Each cartridge was used no more than three times and with more than 10 min between uses, to allow the odor to re-equilibrate. Mutant and control flies were tested in parallel, on the same day, and in the same manner. Stimuli were presented by placing the tip of the cartridge into a glass tube delivering a humidified air stream (~2000 ml/min) to the fly, and administering a 500 ms pulse of air (~200 ml/min) through the cartridge. For experiments with a 30\u00a0s odor stimulus, 25 ml pipettes were used in place of Pasteur pipettes, with three filter papers, each 55 mm in diameter, and 1 ml of odor dilution. These large cartridges were used up to eight times, since independent PID measurements showed no substantial decrease in odor concentration after more than 10 uses. For experiments with a background odor, a 125 ml flask with 5 ml of odor dilution was inserted between the main airstream and the odor delivery tube. Flies were exposed to the background odor for more than 5 min before beginning the experiment."

They found that each is expressed in a specific type(s) of sensilla, in specific subtypes within the basiconic sensilla, and in specific cell types associated with ORNs (but not in ORNs themselves). By analyzing loss of function phenotypes of Obp28a that is uniquely expressed in ab8 basiconic sensillum, they provide strong evidence against the prevailing hypotheses about obp function: transporting odorants to ORNs or removing odorants efficiently after the stimulus period. Rather, their data suggest a new function for obp: gain control to buffer sudden changes in odorant concentrations."

The authors generate a detailed anatomical map for the top 10 antennal expressed (by RNA-seq) OBPs, finding that OBPs differ in which sensilla they are expressed, and also in which cells they are expressed within that sensilla. They identify Obp28a as being the main OBP expressed in ab8 sensilla, generate an <i>obp28a</i> mutant, and characterize odor response properties of the neurons within ab8. Surprisingly, they find that <i>obp28a</i> mutants exhibited increased responses, especially at higher odor concentrations, and often exhibited sustained activity after the odor pulse. This suggests that this OBP may function to sequester odorants, perhaps as a form of gain control. This highlights an unexpected role for OBPs in olfactory signaling."

In the current work, the authors found Obp28a functions to reduce signaling by odorants. This is indeed interesting, as it suggests the roles for Obps will be many and various. But we are left wondering if Obp28a represents a single exception, or part of the varied landscape of Obp functions.

For example, ab4/ab5/ab6 sensilla express only Obp28a and Obp19a (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

For example, Or7a responds to a number of different odorants (for example E2-hexenal and benzaldehyde) whereas Or56a is the sole responder to geosmin. Does high activation of Or56a by geosmin require Obp functions, as seen with cVA and LUSH/Obp76a? This offers many opportunities to examine the role of a different Obp on neuronal firing properties.
