                    "text": "In humans, activation of the ventral striatum, a region associated with reward processing, is associated with the extinction of fear, a goal in the treatment of fear-related disorders. This evidence suggests that extinction of aversive memories engages reward-related circuits, but a causal relationship between activity in a reward circuit and fear extinction has not been demonstrated. Here, we identify a basolateral amygdala (BLA)-ventral striatum (NAc) pathway that is activated by extinction training. Enhanced recruitment of this circuit during extinction learning, either by pairing reward with fear extinction training or by optogenetic stimulation of this circuit during fear extinction, reduces the return of fear that normally follows extinction training. Our findings thus identify a specific BLA-NAc reward circuit that can regulate the persistence of fear extinction and point toward a potential therapeutic target for disorders in which the return of fear following extinction therapy is an obstacle to treatment."

This evidence suggests that extinction of aversive memories engages reward-related circuits, but a causal relationship between activity in a reward circuit and fear extinction has not been demonstrated. Here, we identify a basolateral amygdala (BLA)-ventral striatum (NAc) pathway that is activated by extinction training. Enhanced recruitment of this circuit during extinction learning, either by pairing reward with fear extinction training or by optogenetic stimulation of this circuit during fear extinction, reduces the return of fear that normally follows extinction training. Our findings thus identify a specific BLA-NAc reward circuit that can regulate the persistence of fear extinction and point toward a potential therapeutic target for disorders in which the return of fear following extinction therapy is an obstacle to treatment."

The most common treatment for these disorders is exposure therapy, in which trauma-associated or anxiety-provoking cues are presented in a safe environment in order to decrease gradually, or to extinguish, cue-evoked recollection (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rothbaum and Davis, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Felmingham et al., 2013</a>). A challenge in treating these disorders, however, is the re-emergence of symptoms following therapy, a phenomenon called spontaneous recovery (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pavlov, 1927</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rescorla, 2004</a>). The existence of spontaneous recovery suggests that aversive memories associated with the traumatic incident are temporarily inhibited, but not erased, by exposure therapy and that extinction memories are weakened by the passage of time. Understanding how to strengthen extinction memories so that fear return is lessened is thus critical in designing improved treatment of many fear-related and anxiety disorders."

During fear conditioning, neutral cues (conditional stimuli, CSs) are paired with aversive cues (unconditional stimuli, USs), to induce learned fear. During extinction training, the CSs are presented in the absence of aversive stimuli in order to decrease CS-elicited fear. Associative fear memories that result from fear conditioning can be extinguished, but they exhibit spontaneous recovery (<a href=\"#bib61\">Quirk, 2002</a>), providing a powerful behavioral model by which to identify and study the neural circuits that support these phenomena."

Numerous studies have shown that activity in the NAc is correlated with several measures of learned aversive behaviors (<a href=\"#bib65\">Reynolds and Berridge, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Delgado et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kim et al., 2006a</a>). Moreover, the NAc receives strong glutamatergic inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ambroggi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brog et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Christie et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Floresco et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">O'Donnell and Grace, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wright et al., 1996</a>), a brain region necessary for the acquisition and consolidation of fear extinction (<a href=\"#bib28\">Herry et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Laurent et al., 2008</a>) but not for retrieval or expression of the fear extinction memory (<a href=\"#bib28\">Herry et al., 2008</a>). It has been suggested, accordingly, that activity in the NAc is important for fear extinction (<a href=\"#bib29\">Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Whittle et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2012</a>). The mechanisms underlying such a function of the NAc remain unclear, however, and it is not known whether the NAc is implicated in the persistence of extinction memory, a critical therapeutic question. Based on evidence that the BLA is essential for many forms of motivated learning, including fear extinction and reward learning (<a href=\"#bib29\">Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">LeDoux et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Falls et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herry et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kim et al., 2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Quirk et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bouton, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kelley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gold et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Belova et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Paton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Uwano et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Tye et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Britt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Stuber et al., 2011</a>), and that connections between the BLA and the NAc are important for generating goal-directed behavior in response to reward-predictive cues (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ambroggi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wright et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Britt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Stuber et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Setlow et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">McDonald, 1991a</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Di Ciano and Everitt, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Johnson et al., 1994</a>), we here asked whether fear extinction itself engages a BLA-NAc circuit in rodents and, if so, whether enhancing activity in this circuit during extinction training could reduce the return of fear at a remote time point."

We labeled BLA neurons projecting to the NAc by infusing a fluorescent retrograde tracer, cholera toxin B (CTB) conjugated to Alexa fluor 488 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Conte et al., 2009</a>), into the NAc to allow subsequent detection of labeled BLA-NAc projecting neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Approximately two weeks after surgery, rats were subjected to auditory fear conditioning followed by either (1) a brief auditory fear recall session (<i>Fear recall</i> group; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or (2) two sessions of auditory fear extinction training (<i>Long ext</i> group; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which promoted significant extinction learning and retention (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>).

Rats that received only auditory fear extinction showed significant fear memory on Day 55 (in blue, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013G</a>), but rats that received fear extinction followed by reward conditioning, surprisingly, exhibited virtually no conditional freezing (in magenta, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013G</a>). Notably, for rats in the <i>Ext-RC</i> group, the discriminative responding on the reward task on Day 55 was as robust\u00a0as on Day 5 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2H</a>)."

To test whether it is specifically the reversal of the valence associated with the predictive tone that is critical for enhancing the persistence of auditory extinction memory, we performed an additional control experiment in which rats were trained with auditory fear conditioning followed by two sessions of auditory fear extinction and two sessions of reward conditioning, similar to the training regimen for the <i>Ext-RC</i> group. However, in contrast to the procedure for the <i>Ext-RC</i> group, during reward conditioning, the tone that was originally paired with footshock was presented in the absence of footshock, and a second, novel tone was paired with sucrose delivery (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Despite the successful discriminative reward learning in this group of rats (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), the reward conditioning during extinction did not significantly change the return of fear when compared to rats that received only extinction training (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Thus simply consuming sucrose or forming a new reward association with a novel cue during fear extinction was not sufficient to enhance fear extinction memory."

Immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) showed significantly higher numbers of Nr4a3+ cells in the NAc of rats in the <i>Ext-RC</i> group than in the NAc of rats in the <i>Ext-Ext</i> group. Furthermore, both the <i>Ext-Ext</i> and the <i>Ext-RC</i> groups showed significantly higher density of Nr4a3+ cells in the NAc as compared to the <i>Na\u00efve</i> group (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Notably, reward conditioning combined with fear extinction and reward conditioning alone produced similar densities of Nr4a3+ nuclei (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, inset). These results suggest that reward conditioning during fear extinction recruited the NAc more effectively than fear extinction training alone."

We addressed this issue directly by pairing optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals in the NAc with tone presentations during extinction training (Figure 5B). To establish the feasibility of this approach, we first infused either an adeno-associated virus (AAV; serotype\u00a09) expressing channelrhodopsin fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP; ChETA-eYFP) or, as a control, a similar AAV expressing eYFP alone into the amygdala. After one month to allow anterograde expression of the virus, we used confocal imaging to analyze the distribution of the ChETA-eYFP or eYFP proteins in the BLA and NAc. We found eYFP expressed broadly in both brain regions, indicating successful expression and transport of the protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To test whether ChETA-eYFP was expressed in the presynaptic terminals of BLA neurons projecting to the NAc, we double-labeled NAc sections for eYFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, in green) and synaptophysin, a marker for presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, in red). ChETA-eYFP expression exhibited overlap with synaptophysin staining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, white arrows). This result confirmed that BLA axons projecting to the NAc form direct synaptic connections with NAc neurons, and that the ChETA-eYFP protein was appropriately located to enable us to activate selectively in the NAc the terminals of axons originating in the BLA."

If BLA-induced activation of the NAc led to circuit-level effects, these cortical regions might themselves be affected by terminal stimulation of BLA-NAc afferents. To test for such potential effects, we used cFos immunolabeling to estimate potential activation of these cortical regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Because the projections from the BLA to the NAc are predominantly ipsilateral (<a href=\"#bib9\">Christie et al., 1985</a>), we stimulated the BLA terminals in the NAc of one hemisphere in anesthetized rats [10\u201320 mW, 473 nm, 20\u2009Hz, 5 ms pulses, 65 s interstimulation interval, matching the parameters of the prior experiment in which optogenetic stimulation was administered during fear extinction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)] (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) but visualized immunolabeling bilaterally to compare the effects of stimulation on the ipsilateral and contralateral mPFC. The IL ipsilateral and contralateral to the stimulation site had significantly higher numbers of cFos+ cells than found in na\u00efve rats (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This cFos activation was especially pronounced in the ipsilateral IL (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In the PL, the number of cFos+ cells was significantly greater ipsilateral, but not contralateral, to the side of stimulation, relative to the na\u00efve controls, (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) though the overall magnitude of activation was much lower than that\u00a0observed in the IL. These results suggested that BLA-NAc stimulation can result in activation of the medial wall cortex, especially the IL, and, to a lesser extent, the adjoining PL."

An alternative possibility is suggested by the observation that cFos expression is induced by both synaptic strengthening and synaptic weakening (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lindecke et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kemp et al., 2013</a>). By this logic, cFos-related activation of the BLA-NAc pathway by fear conditioning may indicate synaptic weakening within the BLA-NAc circuit. Although activation of the BLA-NAc pathway is not selective for fear extinction, our data nonetheless support an important and novel role for this pathway in the long-term reduction of fear memory."

However, both manipulations result in a significant reduction of fear expression two months after fear conditioning.

We show that such enhancement of the enduring reduction of fear could be induced by the engagement of the BLA-NAc circuit during fear extinction training. Connections from the BLA to the NAc have already been recognized as important for generating goal-directed behavior in response to appetitive cues (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ambroggi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ghitza et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wan and Peoples, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Day et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nicola et al., 2004a</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2004b</a>). For example, by using a cue discrimination task similar to the one used in our reward conditioning paradigm, it has been shown that the BLA drives NAc neurons to encode the value of a reward-predictive cue (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ambroggi et al., 2008</a>). It is possible that such cue-related plasticity is involved in the BLA-NAc circuit effects that we demonstrate here. Testing this idea by pharmacological inhibition of the BLA or temporally specific inhibition of the BLA-NAc circuit using cue-paired optogenetic silencing during fear extinction with reward conditioning is a natural further step, but these manipulations would produce ambiguous results because they would interfere with the successful acquisition of the rewarding conditioning by reducing or eliminating responding to the reward predictive cue (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ambroggi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Stuber et al., 2011</a>).

An interesting possibility raised by our findings is that fear extinction and fear extinction combined with reward conditioning activate substantially overlapping populations of cells in the NAc, at least if the predictive cue is shared between the two experiences. In our experiments, fear extinction with reward conditioning was only effective when the tone paired with sucrose reward was the same as that previously paired with footshock (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> versus <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

The rostral-caudal border separating reward-related and aversive-related processing within the NAc is dynamic and altered by experience; for instance, stressful environments cause caudal fear-generating zones to expand rostrally (<a href=\"#bib65\">Reynolds and Berridge, 2008</a>). Because emotional experience changes across the fear extinction training, it is difficult to assess systematically whether recruitment of a BLA-NAc circuit by extinction varies along the rostral-caudal axis of the NAc, but our findings do indicate that the NAc can exert a modulatory role during fear extinction through activity of a BLA-NAc circuit. Of note, high frequency stimulation of the BLA produces synaptic depression in rostral NAc, but synaptic potentiation in caudal NAc (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gill and Grace, 2011</a>), and these synaptic changes are thought, respectively, to reduce fearful behaviors and to promote appetitive states (<a href=\"#bib65\">Reynolds and Berridge, 2008</a>). Because the presynaptic terminals originating in the BLA are broadly distributed across the NAc, it is possible that the BLA-NAc circuit biases the appetitive-aversive balance towards an appetitive state (<a href=\"#bib5\">Britt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Stuber et al., 2011</a>).

These results suggest that reward conditioning during fear extinction did not enhance extinction learning simply by promoting exploration, as there was no reward port in the optogenetic experiment to induce behaviors that could compete with freezing responses. Our optogenetic findings also suggest that reward conditioning during fear extinction did not enhance extinction learning by increasing blood glucose levels (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gold et al., 2012</a>). Rats receiving optogenetic stimulation did not receive reward (sucrose), and rats that did receive reward (sucrose) conditioning with a novel tone never paired with shock did not exhibit decreased fear recall.

Our results suggest that back-propagation was unlikely to be responsible for the effects of stimulation on behavior because the laser stimulation in the NAc did not alter multiunit activity in the BLA ipsilateral to the stimulation site or the number of cFos+ nuclei in the BLA. Also, muscimol infusion in the NAc reduced IL activation mediated by BLA-NAc stimulation. These results indicate that optogenetic stimulation-induced activity in the NAc, contributes, at least in part, to the increased activity in the IL, a region known to modulate fear extinction. These results in anesthetized animals parallel our findings in awake, behaving rats: reward conditioning combined with fear extinction produced activation of the IL and, to a lesser extent, the PL (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In addition, other studies have shown that stimulation of the NAc in awake animals activates the IL (<a href=\"#bib82\">Vassoler et al., 2013</a>), as we report here in anesthetized rats.

Our data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) show that anesthetized and na\u00efve, awake rats express similar levels of cFos protein in the BLA, suggesting that it is unlikely that isoflurane anesthesia induces false positive cFos signal in the BLA.

Therefore, it is possible that activation of these collateral projections or fibers of passage could partially account for the increased activation of the IL as a result of optogenetic stimulation of the BLA-NAc circuit or of reward conditioning in combination with fear extinction.

This is supported by the observation that the NAc shows greater expression of Nr4a3 after stimulation than is observed after\u00a0extinction training alone (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). However, the degree to which our stimulation produced greater activation of this pathway than natural extinction training is difficult to quantify for several reasons, including: 1) Viral expression of the opsin targeted only a portion of the BLA, and light delivery targeted only a portion of the NAc, thus only a fraction of the BLA terminals within the NAc could be stimulated, and 2) Our CTB infusions targeted only a small portion of the NAc, and thus identified only a subset of the BLA cells that project to this area. By using activity-dependent expression of channelrhodopsin, as has been used in other experimental contexts (<a href=\"#bib63\">Redondo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gore et al., 2015</a>), we could more precisely enhance activation of the extinction-related portion of the BLA-NAc circuit. In the absence of such a strategy, optogenetic stimulation may induce supra- or non-physiological changes. For example, the degree of activation that we observed in IL after optogenetic stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) might be much greater than is achieved by any behavior. Also, our non-specific strategy may not only have activated BLA-NAc circuits that underlie fear extinction, but also those that may be activated by fear conditioning (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Nevertheless, the fact that optogenetic stimulation produces a similar enhancement to the persistence of fear extinction memory (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) as reward conditioning (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) supports our claim that reward conditioning deepens the persistence of fear extinction memory via more effective recruitment of the BLA-NAc circuit than extinction alone."

This could bias their results in the counterconditioning group such that the animals in this group have reduced fear specifically because these animals were removed and not because the counterconditioning enhanced extinction memory retention. For example, it is possible that animals that couldn't learn reward seeking had higher fear levels or more spontaneous recovery of extinction. The authors need to do something to address this problem. One possibility is to identify animals that would be excluded and then do extinction training and compare these animals that would have been excluded to a normal group of extinction animals to see if there are differences in spontaneous recovery. If not, then there is not a problem with the exclusion criteria."

In other words, increased double labeling would be expected simply by virtue of increasing the number of c-fos positive cells. If this is occurring by chance, then the evidence for specific recruitment of the BLA-NAc pathway would not be provided. Moreover, the statement that the proportion of activated BLA neurons that project to NAc increases with reward conditioning can't be supported without such statistical testing."

The authors need to consider whether the effects they observe are non-physiological effects (essentially activating neurons not normally activated during the relevant behavior) given that they don't know much about the response properties of most of the neurons they are activating optogenetically. This type of issue applies to many (if not most) studies employing optogenetic methodology, but it is one that I think we all need to worry about more. A missing link in this paper is the specific activation only of those BLA cells that are activated by either extinction or reward conditioning. Approaches for accomplishing this type of manipulation are being developed, but it is not clear whether such approaches will work in these experimental paradigms. Nonetheless, recent work from Redondo et al. and Gore et al. both accomplished this type of manipulation in BLA, and these papers probably should have been discussed in the paper, as well as the recent paper from Namburi et al., which, though not using the type of manipulation used by Redondo and Gore, is also highly relevant."

I understand why the authors may have done this for c-fos assays, but electrophysiology could have been performed in awake animals and short latency changes in activity could be observed in the absence of behavioral confound issues. Further, the authors could also inactivate the BLA while photoactivating terminals in NAc to test whether antidromic activation is playing a role. While I would not insist that the authors re-do all of these experiments, appropriate text needs to be added to the Discussion given that the findings may not hold in the absence of anaesthesia."

However, I'm not fully convinced by the authors' implication that fear extinction activated extra NAc-projection neurons in BLA compared with the Fear group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and 1D</a>). This is an unfair comparison for the following reasons. First, the authors chose to perfuse the animals 1 hr after the final behavior session. cFos signals usually peaks at 1.5~2hr after the behavior onset. As fear recall session perhaps lasts much shorter than fear extinction (I could not find details for the behavior protocol. How long is the extinction session? How many trials does it consist? Such essential information is missing from the Methods.), it is likely that less cFos signals in the Fear group was simply due to a shorter expression time from the stimulus onset. Second, the fear extinction session consists many more trials than the fear recall session, so should naturally induce more signals. It will be useful to compare the percentage of double-labeled neurons relative to cFos+ neurons following fear recall and fear extinction. The authors showed 31% for the extinction group. Is the percentage lower for the recall group?"

Ideally, the specificity of BLA-NAc circuit recruitment should be tested experimentally by showing that there is less c-fos activation of another projection after late extinction (which we believe can be done in 1 month). In addition, performing c-fos experiments in awake animals is necessary to support the authors' claims that ontogenetic stimulation did not cause activation of collaterals and that the c-fos expressions observed after optogenetic stimulation reflect normal circuit effects."

The criticism that 95% of the neurons activated by optogenetic manipulation were not activated by fear conditioning+extinction rests on a faulty assumption that optogenetic stimulation activates 100% of the BLA-NAc circuit. However, it should be noted that viral expression of opsins in the BLA targeted only a subset of BLA cells, and thus only a portion of the BLA cells that project to the NAc. It is also important to note that our CTB infusions targeted only a small portion of the NAc, and thus identified only a subset of the BLA cells that project to this area. It is likely that our optogenetic manipulation likely targeted a portion of cells not activated by fear conditioning and extinction, but not nearly to the dramatic degree indicated here (95%). In addition, the magnitude of enhanced extinction persistence seen with stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) is highly similar to the magnitude of enhanced extinction persistence seen with reward conditioning (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), and these conditions that lead to greater persistence of extinction memory are associated with stronger activation of the IL but not PL (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C-F</a>).

The authors need to do something to address this problem.

If inactivation of the BLA during extinction learning <i>without</i> optogenetic stimulation impairs long-term extinction memory, then one cannot use this manipulation to determine whether the modulatory effect of optogenetic stimulation is eliminated. It is for this reason that we performed the experiment to characterize the impact of BLA terminal stimulation in the NAc in anesthetized animals. If substantial antidromic activation of the BLA occurred, it should have induced cFos expression in the BLA cells expressing the opsin (eYFP+), but we did not observe this (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>).

However, to argue that activation measured by IEG expression is not related to behavior requires that IEG expression be expressed randomly. However, IEG expression during memory encoding and retrieval forms the basis for tag and manipulate strategies to identify engrams, and is thus a reliable marker for cells that participate in memory formation or retrieval (Josselyn, Keler, Frankland, Nat. Neurosci. Rev., 2015).

First, fear extinction sessions involve both the expression of previously acquired fear as well as the acquisition of extinction. Thus, it is highly likely that the BLA-CeM pathway is activated during fear extinction. Second, although the Namburi et al. paper is often cited as a demonstration of anatomical specificity, this is a mis-interpretation of the findings. The authors delivered retrobeads to either the CeM or the NAc to visualize BLA cells that projected to these brain regions. The findings reported by Namburi et al. hinge on the argument that BLA cells project to exclusively to the NAc or the CeM. However, the mutual exclusivity of these BLA projections was not quantified or demonstrated. It is apparent from <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 3</a> (modified from Figure 1B in Namburi et al.) that a substantial portion of BLA cells project to both the CeM and NAc (shown by orange arrows which indicate cell bodies which contain retrobeads from both CeM and NAc). In this regard, for all of the experiments in Namburi et al., a substantial proportion of NAc projectors or CeM projectors actually projected to both targets.
