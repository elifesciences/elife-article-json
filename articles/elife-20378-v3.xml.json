The whole process, including recovery, takes 30 min, and the cell is ready to be imaged immediately. A variety of cell viability tests were performed after treatment with SLO to ensure that the cells have intact membranes, are able to divide, respond normally to signaling molecules, and maintains healthy organelle morphology. When combined with Oxyrase, a cell-friendly photostabilizer, a ~20x improvement in fluorescence photostability is achieved. By adding in glutathione, fluorophores are made to blink, enabling super-resolution fluorescence with 20\u201330 nm resolution over a long time (~30 min) under continuous illumination. Example applications in conventional and super-resolution imaging of native and transfected cells include p65 signal transduction activation, single molecule tracking of kinesin, and specific labeling of a series of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein complexes."

                    "text": "Site-specific fluorescent labeling of proteins inside live mammalian cells has been achieved by employing Streptolysin O, a bacterial toxin which forms temporary pores in the membrane and allows delivery of virtually any fluorescent probes, ranging from labeled IgG\u2019s to small ligands, with high efficiency (&gt;85% of cells). The whole process, including recovery, takes 30 min, and the cell is ready to be imaged immediately. A variety of cell viability tests were performed after treatment with SLO to ensure that the cells have intact membranes, are able to divide, respond normally to signaling molecules, and maintains healthy organelle morphology. When combined with Oxyrase, a cell-friendly photostabilizer, a ~20x improvement in fluorescence photostability is achieved. By adding in glutathione, fluorophores are made to blink, enabling super-resolution fluorescence with 20\u201330 nm resolution over a long time (~30 min) under continuous illumination. Example applications in conventional and super-resolution imaging of native and transfected cells include p65 signal transduction activation, single molecule tracking of kinesin, and specific labeling of a series of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein complexes."

However, most of these bio-molecules and fluorophores are not able to cross the cell membrane of a living cell, making it challenging to image intracellular proteins. There are a few exceptions to this barrier, namely, by using few selected cell-permeant fluorophores that have been attached to membrane-permeant entities\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Lukinavi\u010dius et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Grimm et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Wombacher et al., 2010</a>). These have obvious trade-offs of limited choice in emission wavelengths and available class of ligands that they can be covalently attached to and maintain their selectivity for the particular intracellular protein. There has also been mixed success in delivering fluorescent probes by appending a membrane-permeant small peptide such as the TAT-TAR HIV peptide\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Silhol et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Richard et al., 2002</a>). Another method to overcome the permeability issue is by transfecting the cells with plasmid DNA encoding the intracellular protein of interest appended to a fluorescent protein (FP). Nonetheless, there are many cases where such transfection is not possible or not desirable. In addition, the detection of FPs is less than optimal because of their limited photostability."

Fluorescence images of SLO treated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) revealed 94% (15 out of 16 cells) of the cells in the field of view contains nuclear staining by DAPI, 88% of the cells contains clear and punctate structure of labeled peroxisomes, and 88% of the cells showed filamentous structure of the actin \u2013 a stark contrast to SLO untreated negative control cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). In addition, field of views other than the one shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> were counted, and the result shows similar degree of permeabilization with a standard deviation of 8% (<i>N = 49 cells</i>). To confirm the membrane integrity after recovery, SLO-treated cells were incubated for 5 min with Texas Red dextran, (~20 kDa), a normally membrane-impermeant fluorescent molecule. The membrane of recovered cells efficiently excluded Texas Red dextran (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). In contrast, the negative control cells that were not treated with SLO, showed no fluorescence signal until cells were permeabilized by SLO (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). The health of the cells after permeabilization is a universal problem in any methods attempting to compromise the cell membrane. In this study, we performed several cell viability assays to demonstrate that the cells remain viable after recovering from SLO permeabilization (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Here, we used the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), bound to GFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We found that GBP-ATTO647N (~14 kDa) was able to passively diffuse across the nuclear membrane, or diffuse through the nucleus pore complex, in order to label the nuclear proteins PCNA-GFP. In a separate test we found that 40 kDa FITC-dextran was able to access nucleus as well. (The fluorescence of FITC-dextran is homogenously distributed across the nucleus and cytoplasm.) In contrast, probes larger than GBP, such as streptavidin (labeled SA, 53 kDa) or 70 kDa FITC-dextran (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>), were not able to passively diffuse across the nuclear membrane. This cut-off for passive diffusion between 40\u201356 kDa is consistent with the known size-limit for diffusion into nuclear pores (<a href=\"#bib4\">Gr\u00fcnwald et al., 2011</a>)."

On the other hand, \u2018large\u2019 molecules, &gt;20 kDa dextran or other similar-sized proteins, remained in the cytoplasm, creating evenly distributed fluorescence across the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Apparently, the pore formed by SLO allows the fluorescently labeled proteins free access to entering the cell, while allowing free access for exit only for relatively small (&lt;2 kDa) proteins. To explain this observation, we hypothesize that some of the larger probes do get washed out, but not fast enough before the membrane starts to heal, and only smaller probes are given enough time to be diffuse out completely. This background-free staining makes permeabilization by SLO advantageous over other methods like microinjection or microporation, where free probes cannot be washed away (<a href=\"#bib6\">Hennig et al., 2015</a>). In addition, the required concentration of fluorescent chloroalkane with SLO-treated cells was a factor of ten lower than that recommended by the manufacturer. This might be because the manufacturer\u2019s means of getting the ligand into the cell depends on setting up a concentration gradient across the cell membrane, whereas none is necessary with SLO."

To cause photo-blinking necessary for dSTORM, the oxygen concentration must be kept low and a thiol-containing reducing agent must be present. 4 mM glutathione and the commercially available Oxyrase (an oxygen scavenger compatible with live cell imaging) were therefore added (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013b</a>). We measured actin dynamics for 20,000 frames at 100 ms time resolution, for a total time of 33 min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Such tremendous photostability was the result of Oxyrase and glutathione; without them, fewer activations of Alexa647 were observed in response to a 405 nm laser. Finally, we observed a thick actin bundle split over the course of ~3 min into two separate strands, ~850 nm apart using this live super-resolution approach (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Note that phalloidin is an actin stabilizer and certainly will interfere with the normal dynamic of actin. Here, we are using it as a proof-of-principle example to showcase the possibility of performing live-cell dSTORM using our technique. In addition to actin, we have also done super-resolution dSTORM imaging on Histone 2B and mitochondria labeled with Alexa647 and Alexa660 chloroalkane (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "Next, we applied SLO permeabilization to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the FP for in vivo single-particle tracking applications and to visualize individual fluorescent proteins amongst a large background of over-expressed FPs. FPs works very well for visualizing ensemble of proteins in cell, and constructs of FPs attached to numerous intracellular protein of interest have already been made. However, it remains difficult to study these proteins down to a single molecule level from the fluorescence signal of individual FPs due to low brightness and photostability. The goal here is to label FPs with nanobodies conjugated to dyes with photostability superior to the FPs. For instance, we show that the signal can be improved ~6-fold by detecting the signal of GBP-ATTO647N than the GFP itself (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3a\u2013b</a>). Using this method, we can perform single molecule studies on a vast library of existing protein constructs with FP attached by using just FP binding nanobodies conjugated to a fluorophore with better photostability and brightness. Note that attaching multiple dyes per probe can potentially enhance the signal further; here, most of the nanobodies had one organic dye. Using this method, we tracked single kinesin molecules in the cytoplasm of U2OS cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). We transfected the cells with 2x-mCherry-kinesin (K560), a truncated version of dimeric kinesin-1 with two mCherry\u2019s per kinesin monomer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Norris et al., 2015</a>). Based on the fluorescence of mCherry alone, it is difficult to track a single kinesin protein in vivo, due to both the poor SNR of mCherry and the high background fluorescence created by out-of-focus FPs at different z-positions in the cytoplasm. Here, we enhance the kinesin signal by delivering RFP binding nanobody (RBP-ATTO647N), which binds specifically to mCherry (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3c</a>). Labeled individual kinesins can now easily be detected; an example trace is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>, and an example cell showing moving kinesins labeled with ATTO647N-RBP is shown <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>. The average run length and velocity was determined to be 621 \u00b1 99 nm (Decay constant \u00b1 SE) and 1058 \u00b1 22 nm/s (Center \u00b1 SEM) at 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). Both the run length and velocity agrees with the in vitro data on single kinesin at 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kawaguchi and Ishiwata, 2000</a>). In addition, we have performed the experiment at room temperature, and indeed we observed a decrease in kinesin velocity (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3d\u2013e</a>). Thus, using this technique we were able to track otherwise difficult to observe single molecules in vivo, and allowed us to study the biophysical properties of molecular motors in the cytoplasm of living cells."

Importantly, we have applied SLO to label cells without transfection. This is achieved by labeling intracellular proteins with antibodies, nanobodies, and bio-specific ligands. This technique has tremendous application for avoiding artifacts caused by over-expression due to transfection. Furthermore, we create an environment for generating photoswitchable and photostable fluorophores in vivo for dSTORM, and enhance the signal of FPs for single particle tracking. Our SLO delivery technique can easily be combined with other signal enhancement techniques, such as \u2018spaghetti monster\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Viswanathan et al., 2015</a>), for delivering otherwise membrane impermeant probes into living cells for labeling a single protein with numerous probes at once. Lastly, this technique is not limited to delivering of fluorescent probes; the technique can potentially be extended to other types of microscopy that relies on probe delivery, such as cryo-electron microscopy."

Fluorescent probes were diluted in Tyrode\u2019s buffer without calcium (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4). After SLO permeabilization, the cells were washed 2x with DPBS + 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The cells were fluorescently labeled by incubating with the probes, such as DAPI, chloroalkane-Alexa660 (Promega), Alexa647-Phalloidin (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2620155\">AB_2620155</a>, Thermo Scientific), nanobody-dye conjugate (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2629215\">AB_2629215</a>, Chromotek), and labeled anti-PMP70-ATTO488 IgG (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1841112\">AB_1841112</a>, P0090, Sigma-Aldrich), or labeled polyclonal anti-GFP Alexa647 IgG (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_162553\">AB_162553</a>, A-31852, Thermo Scientific) at a final concentration of 300\u2013700 nM for 5 min on ice. In addition, the nanobody used in this work was either custom purified\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Wang et al., 2014</a>) or purchased, and could be used interchangeably. The custom nanobody was labeled through the amine group and NHS-dye. Free dyes were purified using 6 kDa Micro Bio-Spin 6 (Bio-Rad) or 7 kDa Zeba Spin desalting column (Thermo Scientific). For preparation of chloroalkane-SA probe, SA was incubated with biotin-PEG-chloroalkane at 1:6 molar ratio for 10 min. Free SA binding sites were then saturated with excess free biotin for 5 min and the sample was purified by using an Amicon concentrator (30 kDa MW cutoff, EMD Millipore). If the probe is prone to cause non-specific binding on the coverslip or cell membrane, 40x dilution of 10X Casein (Vector Lab) was added to the Tyrode\u2019s buffer along with the probes. After labeling, the cells were washed 3x with Tyrode\u2019s buffer, and incubated with recovery medium (Phenol red (P/R) free DMEM with sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM GTP, 2 mg/mL glucose, without antibiotic) for 20 min. The idea to replace lost nucleotide triphosphate and glucose was adapted from previous publication (<a href=\"#bib7\">Kano et al., 2012</a>). To check whether the cell membrane has recovered, the cells were washed with PBS 3x, and incubated with 500 nM of 20 kDa Texas Red dextran diluted in DPBS with 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> for 5 min. As a negative control, another coverslip of cell underwent the same treatment except the addition of SLO was also imaged. The negative control was then exposed to SLO and consequently 20 kDa Texas Red dextran to show that the cells are permeant to 20 kDa Texas Red dextran if the cell membrane was still permeable."

For PCNA-GFP used in the study, pcDNA3_NLS_eGFP_hPCNA was derived from pENeGFPPCNA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Leonhardt et al., 2000</a>); eGFP-PCNA was cut from pENeGFPPCNA with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into pcDNA3 cut with HindIII and XbaI using an adapter (AGCTTATGGCTTCGTGGGGATC) to reconstruct the correct start codon for eGFP-PCNA. Unless specified otherwise, the permeabilization procedure was done on cells after overnight transfection. 2xmCherry-K560 plasmid was a gift from Verhey Lab (U. Michigan)."

Excitation lasers (MLC400B, Agilent Technologies, 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm) were used for exciting different fluorescent probes. The images were recorded in an EMCCD (iXon DU-897E, Andor). A quad-band dichroic (ZT405-488-561-640RPC, Chroma) was used for reflectance of the excitation laser and transmission of fluorescence. The emission filter choices were 525/50 (DAPI, GFP, ATTO488), 600/50 (mCherry, Texas Red, PI), or 700/75 (Alexa647, ATTO647N). The live cell samples were imaged inside a 30\u00b0C temperature controlled chamber (InVivo Scientific) unless otherwise noted. The static conventional fluorescence images shown were averages of 10 frames taken at 50\u2013100 ms, except for the kinesin experiment, where the spots were rapidly moving so a single frame image was shown. The cells were imaged in 10% FBS DMEM P/R free medium on a glass-bottom dish."

A series of images were recorded after the addition of Oxyrase up to a total of 2 hr.

For each cell, a 300 frames movie was recorded using 200 ms exposure time. Spots that move processively for \u22653 frames without running into another molecule were cropped from the movie. For localization, the point spread function was fit to a 2D Gaussian distribution, and the position is given by the center. Localization accuracy is typically ~20 nm. The kinesin positions are rotated to linearize the displacement in one dimension. The velocity and run length is determined from the position and time of the first to last frame. In majority of our traces, the kinesin travels for &lt;10 frames without pauses."

In general this method will be very useful for the microscopy and biophysics community. It could become a standard labeling method. There are many applications where an easy delivery method would be useful. These include microscopy of living cells, structural mapping of proteins with FRET, drug delivery, etc."

The possibility of using small quantum dot to efficiently label intracellular proteins was in fact one of the driving motivation behind this project. At this point, we had some preliminary luck getting small quantum dots inside, but it turned out that it requires a different type of coating to bring them in efficiently. The standard coating used in reference 25 requires blocking agents such as casein or BSA to prevent it from sticking to the cell membrane non-specifically, and by doing so, we suspect that it increases the size of the quantum dots. We now have a new type of quantum dot with a different polymer coating that does not require the use of blocking proteins. With these, we could deliver small quantum dots inside cells in an amount that is clearly not caused by endocytosis. However, we are still working on functionalizing chemistry of these small quantum dots for specific protein targeting. Since the emphasis of the paper is to label intracellular proteins and because we have not proven that intracellular proteins were labeled with the small quantum dots, we decided not to include it in this manuscript."
