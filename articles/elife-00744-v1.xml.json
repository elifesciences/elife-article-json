IFT has been implicated in sensory and motile ciliary functions, but the mechanisms of this relationship remain unclear. Here, we used <i>Chlamydomonas</i> flagellar surface motility (FSM) as a model to test whether IFT provides force for gliding of cells across solid surfaces. We show that IFT trains are coupled to flagellar membrane glycoproteins (FMGs) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. IFT trains transiently pause through surface adhesion of their FMG cargos, and dynein-1b motors pull the cell towards the distal tip of the axoneme. Each train is transported by at least four motors, with only one type of motor active at a time. Our results demonstrate the mechanism of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> gliding motility and suggest that IFT plays a major role in adhesion-induced ciliary signaling pathways."

IFT has been implicated in sensory and motile ciliary functions, but the mechanisms of this relationship remain unclear. Here, we used <i>Chlamydomonas</i> flagellar surface motility (FSM) as a model to test whether IFT provides force for gliding of cells across solid surfaces. We show that IFT trains are coupled to flagellar membrane glycoproteins (FMGs) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. IFT trains transiently pause through surface adhesion of their FMG cargos, and dynein-1b motors pull the cell towards the distal tip of the axoneme. Each train is transported by at least four motors, with only one type of motor active at a time. Our results demonstrate the mechanism of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> gliding motility and suggest that IFT plays a major role in adhesion-induced ciliary signaling pathways."

Intraflagellar transport has been proposed to influence other functions of cilia and flagella, including the propulsion of cells over surfaces.

By tracking single fluorescently tagged molecules, Shih et al. observed that flagellar membrane glycoproteins are carried along the axoneme by the intraflagellar transport machinery. During transport, flagellar membrane glycoproteins transiently adhere to the surface, and dynein motors that were previously engaged in carrying these glycoproteins now transmit force that moves the axonemal microtubules. This process, which is dependent on the concentration of calcium ions in the extracellular environment, generates the force that propels the alga's flagella along the surface."

How the intricate mechanism of flagellar beat motility could have evolved has been the subject of much discussion, as it would require the flagellum to have evolved first. In demonstrating that gliding motility is powered by the same intraflagellar transport mechanism that is required for flagellar assembly, Shih et al. provide strong evidence for the evolution of primitive flagella before the evolution of flagellar beating. Furthermore, since algal flagella have essentially the same structure as the cilia of human cells, these findings could ultimately aid in the development of treatments for diseases that result from defects in intraflagellar transport, including polycystic kidney disease and retinal degeneration."

In order to assemble and maintain cilia, ciliary proteins are transported from cytoplasm to the tip by IFT along axonemes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kozminski et al., 1993</a>). In IFT, linear arrays of multiprotein complexes (IFT trains) are transported by kinesin-2 and dynein-1b in anterograde and retrograde directions, respectively (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cole et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Porter et al., 1999</a>). IFT is a universal mechanism for nearly all eukaryotic cilia and flagella, and defects in this process are linked to a wide range of human diseases, including polycystic kidney disease, retinal degeneration (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</a>), and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lechtreck et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wei et al., 2012</a>)."

In <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, the flagellar surface is highly dynamic; polystyrene microspheres and other inanimate small objects adhere to and are moved bidirectionally along the flagellar surface, and cells glide over solid surfaces via adhesion of their flagella (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lewin, 1952</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bloodgood, 1981</a>). Gliding motility is central to understanding the function and evolution of cilia, as it may have existed in early cilia before the establishment of axonemal beating. There are indications that gliding and FMG1-B motility are driven by the same process (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloodgood, 2009</a>), because they move at comparable speeds and both require ligation of the major flagellar surface protein, FMG1-B, into large clusters (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bloodgood and Workman, 1984</a>), accompanied by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bloodgood and Salomonsky, 1994</a>). Microsphere movement is considered a more easily assayed and quantitated surrogate for the force transduction system that drives whole cell gliding motility. However, gliding is driven by the pulling motion of the leading flagellum, whereas FMG1-B movement is bidirectional (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloodgood, 2009</a>), implying that the two motilities could employ different motors."

While these results suggest that kinesin-2 serves as the anterograde motor responsible for both microsphere movement and gliding motility (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kozminski et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Laib et al., 2009</a>), the retrograde motor for these motilities has not been clearly identified. Mutations in the LC8 subunit of dynein do not abolish FMG1-B movement (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pazour et al., 1998</a>), and other flagellar motors, such as the minus-end directed kinesin KCBP (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dymek et al., 2006</a>), have been proposed to drive FSM (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloodgood, 2009</a>)."

IFT motility differs significantly from FSM in that trains move faster and more processively along the length of the flagellum (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kozminski et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bloodgood, 2009</a>). FSM requires micromolar levels of free calcium, whereas IFT is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kozminski et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bloodgood, 2009</a>). Sexual agglutinins were observed to migrate from the cell body into flagella in the absence of IFT (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pan and Snell, 2002</a>). Therefore, evidence supporting the role of IFT in gliding motility is indirect and the precise functions of IFT, molecular motors, FMG1-B and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in FSM remain unclear."

We monitored the movement of individual IFT trains by using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illumination to image paralyzed-flagella (<i>pf</i>) mutant cells that had adhered to the glass surface with both flagella. To establish a link between FMG1-B transport and IFT, we simultaneously tracked the movement of FMG1-B antibody-coated fluorescent beads (200 nm diameter, dark red) and IFT27-GFP in the <i>pf18</i> strain. The beads performed short processive runs with reversals of direction whereas IFT trains moved in a regular and unidirectional manner. Multicolor kymography analysis shows that the beads transiently dissociated from one IFT train, diffused for a period of time and then bound to another IFT train (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) similar to the movement of extraflagellar particles observed along the flagellar membrane (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dentler, 2005</a>). Diffraction-limited images of beads and IFT trains were fitted to a two-dimensional Gaussian to achieve a higher localization precision (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yildiz et al., 2003</a>). <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> shows the colocalization of a membrane-attached bead with an individual IFT train as it moves unidirectionally for &gt;500 nm. The movements of the bead and the colocalized IFT trains correlate strongly (&gt;0.99) with each other during the processive run (N = 30, see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for more examples), excluding the possibility that microspheres coincidentally moved together with IFT trains. We measured the distance between microspheres and the nearest IFT trains moving in the same direction for both the experimental data and randomly generated kymographs. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p=7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) demonstrates that IFT trains colocalize with FMG1-B along the flagellar membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Remarkably, the pausing of IFT trains was required for the initiation of whole-cell movements (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). We did not observe the start of a gliding event without a paused IFT train. We were able to determine the directionality of 60% of the paused IFT trains, and all of the trains correspondent to the initiation of gliding motility stopped moving during retrograde transport (N = 148). To rule out the possibility that IFT pausing events and initiation of gliding motility are simply coincidental, we quantified the lag time between the pausing of the last retrograde IFT train and the initiation of gliding motility. The average lag time was 0.48 \u00b1 0.05 s. In comparison, we observed individual IFT pausing events (including both anterograde and retrograde pauses) every 8.25 \u00b1 0.96 s per cell (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

First, uniflagellate <i>pf18</i> cells always glided with the flagellum leading the cell body at 1.49 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b5m/s (mean \u00b1 SEM) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloodgood, 2009</a>), suggesting that gliding motility is driven by pulling forces generated through a minus end directed microtubule motor. In contrast to <i>pf18</i> cells, uniflagellate dynein-1b <i>ts</i> cells (<i>dhc1b-3</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Engel et al., 2012</a>) were unable to display robust gliding at restrictive temperatures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We observed only short-range (&lt;500 nm) gliding-like motion in 54% of these cells, compared to robust unidirectional gliding motility observed over 5 \u00b5m in <i>pf18</i> cells. These short-range motions were bidirectional (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and significantly slower (forward: 0.35 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5m/s, backward: 0.47 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b5m/s) than the gliding speed of <i>pf18</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Second, inactivation of dynein-1b in biflagellate <i>dhc1b-3</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> cells decreased the fraction of gliding cells from 100% to 52% and reduced the gliding speed from 0.86 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b5m/s to 0.18 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5m/s. In contrast, inactivation of kinesin-2 in <i>fla10</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> cells resulted in a twofold increase in gliding speed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), indicating that kinesin plays an inhibitory role during dynein-1b driven gliding motility. These results agree with our observations that the pausing of anterograde trains does not initiate gliding motility."

During 60% of reversals (N = 40), the cell lifted one of its flagella and the paused IFT trains on the surface-adhered flagellum drove the motility (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloodgood, 2009</a>). In other cases, single or multiple paused IFT trains accumulated in one flagellum, and the cell body glided toward this cluster until the paused trains either detached from the glass surface or reached the flagellar base. We also observed cases with paused IFT trains in both flagella where the cell remained immotile, likely due to the balance of forces between bound dynein-1b motors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>). There were no indications of coordination of the pausing events between the two flagella. Different modes of reversals in gliding motility may allow cells to search through the environment by a random walk when they adhere both of their flagella, and to move in unidirectional manner by lifting one of the flagella."

To quantify pausing in flagella, we used Fourier space direction analysis (FSDA, see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) to separate the traces of paused IFT trains and moving IFT trains into two kymographs. Kymographs of paused IFT trains in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a> show that pausing along the length of the flagellum was significantly reduced in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-deprived cells (see additional examples in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We observed that IFT trains remained colocalized with trapped beads when subjected to external forces (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for additional examples). The average offset between the positions of the trapped beads and colocalized IFT trains was 280 \u00b1 10 nm (N = 11). This is due to the fact that the beads (920 nm diameter) and IFT trains (200\u20131000 nm in length) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pigino et al., 2009</a>) are large objects relative to the resolution of conventional fluorescence imaging (approximately 200\u2013250 nm) and the forces that stretch the bead-FMG1-B-IFT linkage displace the center of the bead from the IFT train (see the schematics in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The trap measurements correspond to forces generated by IFT motors and provide direct evidence that IFT transports FMG1-B. Since beads are outside the cell, but are physically linked to the action of IFT trains, the assay combines the advantages of precise in vitro trapping with the ability to manipulate IFT motility under load."

We did not observe a significant difference between the force values of stall and release events. This suggests that motors attached to an IFT train may not be able to reach their maximum stall force, defined as the stall force of a single motor multiplied by the number of bound motors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shubeita et al., 2008</a>). Histograms of peak forces (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) show that anterograde and retrograde IFT trains moved against 21.4 \u00b1 0.7 pN and 25.2 \u00b1 1.3 pN (SEM), respectively. Forces exerted on IFT trains well exceed the force-generation capability of a single motor. Previous studies demonstrated that multiple motors produce larger forces, move with higher velocities under load and carry cargos further than a single kinesin or dynein motor (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mallik et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Vershinin et al., 2007</a>). It remains controversial whether motor stall forces are additive at low motor copy numbers (<a href=\"#bib50\">Vershinin et al., 2007</a>) or whether multiple motors tend to transport their cargo using only one load-bearing motor at a time (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jamison et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, we believe that peak forces in our experiment represent a lower boundary for estimates of motor copy number. Assuming that IFT motors produce 6\u20137 pN forces (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gennerich et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brunnbauer et al., 2010</a>), we estimate that at least four motors transport IFT trains at a time, in agreement with previously reported values (<a href=\"#bib18\">Engel et al., 2009b</a>). It is possible that multiple motor engagements enhance the run length of individual IFT trains, allowing them to traverse the length of a flagellum. In addition, the fast transport of IFT trains in a viscous cellular environment and IFT\u2019s role in FSM may require forces larger than single motor stall forces."

Our results rule out the possibility that microtubule motors step backwards during the recoiling of the bead, as the average bead velocity was 20 \u00b5m/s (an order of magnitude faster than that of dynein and kinesin) and there were no detectable backward steps. To rule out other possible interactions between IFT trains and axonemes, we oscillated individual beads on a flagellar membrane surface in a square wave pattern and measured the recoiling time when the beads are decoupled from IFT (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The average viscous drag constant was 8.4 \u00b1 4.2 pN.s/\u00b5m, which is similar to the drag that beads experience when they interact with IFT trains. Anterograde and retrograde trains moving at 2\u20133 \u00b5m/s would experience 16\u201324 pN resistive forces, comparable to the total motor force exerted on a single IFT train (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Therefore, IFT is subjected to a high drag force when it carries a large bead along the flagellar surface, which leads to the reduction of transport velocity."

This could theoretically be explained by a tug-of-war between active kinesin and dynein motors that are both present on the same IFT train. Alternatively, kinesin-2 and dynein-1b motors may be exclusively active on anterograde and retrograde cargos, respectively, and pausing of anterograde trains could produce forces that oppose the gliding forces of paused retrograde trains. To distinguish between tug-of-war and coordinated transport mechanisms, we examined how inhibition of one class of motors affected the forces exerted on IFT trains traveling in the opposite direction (<a href=\"#bib31\">Laib et al., 2009</a>). At permissive temperatures, the peak forces of IFT in <i>fla10-1</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> and <i>dhc1b-3</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> were in close agreement with wild-type (WT) cells. Heat-inactivation of kinesin-2 reduced the frequency of anterograde runs by 66%, but did not alter the peak forces on retrograde runs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Laib et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Similarly, heat inactivation of dynein-1b significantly reduced the ratio of retrograde to anterograde transport events (0.15), but had minimal effect on the peak forces of anterograde runs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). These results exclude a tug-of-war mechanism in IFT, which would lead to an increase of force from motors walking in one direction upon inactivation of the motors walking in the opposite direction. Instead, only one type of a motor remains active on IFT trains at a time, which is consistent with the result that retrograde speed of <i>fla10-1</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> does not change after kinesin-2 is inactivated. We propose that kinesin-2 on paused anterograde trains slows down gliding motility by exerting forces in the opposite direction to that of dynein-1b on paused retrograde trains."

In <i>Chlamydomonas,</i> IFT trains carry FMG1-B as a cargo. The interaction between IFT trains and FMG1-B clusters is transient, as FMG1-B boards moving trains but usually unloads and diffuses away before the trains arrive at the flagellar base or tip. During gliding motility, IFT trains pause due to attachment of the FMG1-B cargo to the surface, and the dynein-1b motors engaged to the paused IFT trains generate pulling forces along the microtubule long axis. While the majority of organismal motilities rely on the actin cytoskeleton or axonemal beating, gliding motility in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> is distinct in that it is powered by intracellular transport machinery along microtubules. By providing surface adhesion points, FMG1-B performs an analogous function to integrins in mammalian cell motility (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloodgood, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lecuit et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "Our results also demonstrate how different types of flagellar motility in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> have distinct characteristics despite being driven by the same forces. First, we showed that viscous drag of the membrane slows down the motility of IFT trains that carry FMG1-B-conjugated beads, causing gliding motility and FMG1-B transport to proceed slower than IFT. Second, previous work showed that IFT is unaffected by changes in environmental Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bloodgood and Salomonsky, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kozminski et al., 1993</a>), whereas gliding motility is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bloodgood and Salomonsky, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kozminski et al., 1993</a>). This raised the possibility that Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be required to activate a specific motor protein that provides force for gliding (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloodgood, 2009</a>). Our results are inconsistent with this hypothesis. We found that the presence of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to frequent pauses in IFT motility at flagellar adhesion sites. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, IFT moves unidirectionally without interruptions, suggesting that attachment of FMG1-B to IFT trains is regulated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling pathway. The signaling pathway responsible for linking FMG1-B to IFT remains unclear. There is evidence that surface adhesion or crosslinking of FMG1-B into large clusters induces dephosphorylation of a transmembrane protein that co-immunoprecipitates with FMG1-B (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bloodgood and Salomonsky, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">1998</a>). The complex may be regulated by a calcium-calmodulin dependent gliding associated kinase (GAK), which is required for the gliding motility (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bloodgood and Spano, 2002</a>). Further investigation is required to identify the rest of the signaling pathway regulating IFT-flagellar surface interactions."

In a previous trapping assay, beads nonspecifically adsorbed to the flagellar membrane were found to exert 60 pN average peak forces (<a href=\"#bib31\">Laib et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, our measured peaked forces are significantly lower (20\u201330 pN) than these values. Laib et al. could not determine whether their force measurements reflect the forces produced by motors attached to IFT trains or by motors that are directly bound to FMG1-B clusters. Our experiments directly link optical trap recordings of bead motility to forces generated by flagellar motors attached to IFT trains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), enabling us to propose physical models for the coordination of IFT and its role in FSM. In agreement with Laib et al., we observe reciprocal coordination of motors during anterograde transport. Additionally, our measurements of dynein-1b inactivation verify that motors do not engage in a tug-of-war while travelling in the retrograde direction."

For example, IFT is required for signal transduction during the mating of ciliated organisms. The initial interaction between gametes of two mating types in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> can occur at any point along their flagellar membranes, but the tips of their flagella must be aligned and locked before activating gametic fusion (<a href=\"#bib24\">Homan et al., 1987</a>). Since IFT trains transport sexual agglutinins within the flagellar membrane of gametic cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ferris et al., 2005</a>), adhesion between sexual agglutinins of opposite cell types may stall retrograde IFT movement. As a result, forces produced by IFT trains would move the flagellar contact points until a balance of forces is achieved when the flagella are properly aligned with respect to each other. Indeed, microspheres have been observed to move and accumulate at the flagellar tips during mating (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hoffman and Goodenough, 1980</a>). We propose that the absence of retrograde bead movement may be related to the formation of adhesion contacts between the flagella and pausing of retrograde IFT trains."

These contacts are tight adhesions between the ciliary membranes, mediated by N-linked glycoproteins. It is possible that IFT exerts force on cell-cell adhesion sites and determines the positioning of these adhesion sites by moving them along the length of the cilium. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at flagellar adhesion sites may play a major role in regulating attachment to IFT trains and controlling the direction of force generation. We believe that the assay we developed will be a starting point for deciphering the role of IFT in the signaling, mating and development of ciliated cells."

We clarified this statement by indicating the origin of discussion in the main text as follows: \u201cPrevious studies showed that multiple motors produce larger forces, move with higher velocities under load and carry cargos further than a single kinesin or dynein motor (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mallik et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Vershinin et al., 2007</a>). It remains controversial whether motor stall forces are additive at low motor copy numbers (<a href=\"#bib50\">Vershinin et al., 2007</a>) or whether multiple motors tend to transport their cargo using only one load-bearing motor at a time (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jamison et al., 2010</a>). Our data show that the average forces exerted on IFT trains well exceed the force-generation capability of a single motor. [We did not observe a significant difference between the force values of stall and release events. The data indicate that multiple motors attached to an IFT train may not be able to reach their maximum stall force, defined as the stall force of a single motor multiplied by the number of bound motors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shubeita et al., 2008</a>).]\u201d"

To make this point clear, we are attaching a typical PSD response as a function of true distance between the bead and the trap center (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a>, below)."

However, temperature dependence of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> dynein-1b and kinesin-2 velocity has not been explored in vitro. Most relevant studies were performed in in live <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells, which showed that IFT speed does not vary between 22\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C (Lomini et al., JCB 2001). It remains unclear whether the speed of IFT motors is independent of temperature, or the gliding speed is limited by the net force production on paused IFT trains, which is temperature independent."

We reckon that there can be several reasons why our observations are different from the previously published results. First, we use TIRF illumination, which is highly sensitive to the distance to the surface compared to brightfield imaging. Second, in certain cases, the cell only needs to lift a part of its flagellum to release the surface-attached IFT trains. We categorize these events as the cell lifts its flagellum to reverse gliding direction. We are not sure how these events were classified in previous studies. Third, different cell strains seem to have different tendency to lift their flagella. For example, <i>pf18</i> strain tends to lift one of its flagella during gliding less frequently. In our experiments, we used IFT27-GFP strain, which is different from the strains that are previously used for this experiment."
