This third protein, which is called E-Cadherin, normally helps cells to adhere to other cells. Malaguti et al. showed that losing this protein encourages cells to become either nerve or mesoderm tissues, and that a drop in E-Cadherin levels must occur before nerve tissue can form."

It has been known for many years that BMP signalling protects pluripotency and suppresses neural specification (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ying et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Stern, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Di-Gregorio et al., 2007</a>), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. BMP signalling is also required for the formation of mesoderm <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mishina et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Winnier et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lawson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beppu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davis et al., 2004</a>), and BMP is commonly used to induce mesoderm from embryonic stem (ES) cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Murry and Keller, 2008</a>). However, it is not clear how the effects of BMP on mesoderm differentiation relate to its pro-pluripotency and anti-neural effects: are these separable independent events or do they represent the outcomes of one common mechanism? This question underlines our poor understanding of the mechanisms by which BMP influences neural and mesodermal specification."

Id factors generally act as dominant negative inhibitors of the bHLH family of transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Norton, 2000</a>), but the mechanism by which Id proteins block neural induction is not known. Furthermore, it is not clear to what extent the pro-mesoderm effect of BMP within the epiblast is mediated by Id or by other BMP target genes: redundancy between the four Id family members may mask gastrulation phenotypes in Id mutants."

A number of recent reports (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Soncin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Redmer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">del Valle et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Faunes et al., 2013</a>) suggest that Cdh1 helps protect pluripotency. Despite this emerging appreciation of Cdh1 as a regulator of the pluripotent state, the upstream regulators of Cdh1 in pluripotent cells have not been reported. BMP favours mesenchymal to epithelial transitions in other contexts (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kondo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2010</a>), but its ability to control Cdh1 activity during early fate specification has not previously been appreciated."

Id1 may therefore play an early role in anterior-posterior (AP) patterning and mesoderm priming, independent from any effect on overt mesoderm differentiation. This helps to reconcile why BMP is required both for mesoderm differentiation and for the maintenance of pluripotency."

Furthermore, in the presence of BMP4, downregulation of <i>Oct4</i> is delayed, and markers that characterise EMT and overt mesoderm differentiation are not upregulated within the 5-day time frame of this experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). As a positive control, we checked that these markers were upregulated within 4 days in control cells that were put through a directed mesodermal differentiation protocol based on monolayer culture on collagen IV in the presence of serum (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nishikawa et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

We therefore considered whether the ability of BMP4 to upregulate T may represent an effect on positional identity within the epiblast rather than a direct effect to drive mesoderm commitment. In support of this idea, we found that in the presence of BMP4, T is coexpressed with Cdh1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Not all cells persist in a T+ Cdh1+ state: a subpopulation of cells (typically between 10 and 25%) are able to differentiate into a Cdh1+ Tcfap2a (AP2\u03b1)+ epithelial cell type similar to early surface ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mitchell et al., 1991</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

These data are consistent with the idea that Id1, like BMP, favours a posterior proximal epiblast identity whilst delaying overt differentiation. In keeping with this idea, Id1 favours the re-expression of <i>Nanog</i>, which marks posterior pluripotent epiblast, and Id1 also reduces expression of <i>Sox2,</i> which marks anterior pluripotent epiblast (<a href=\"#bib33\">Osorno et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We confirmed that <i>Nanog</i> in this context is likely to be marking a posterior epiblast-like cell rather than an earlier na\u00efve pluripotent state because other markers of na\u00efve pluripotency, <i>Klf4</i>, <i>Rex1</i> and <i>Esrrb</i>, are rapidly lost in Id1 overexpressing cells, as they are in control cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>)."

Indeed, around 50% of cells are negative for Flag on day 5 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Therefore, in order to address whether Id1 is sufficient to block differentiation, we turned to a constitutive expression system. We generated clonal lines of ES cells stably overexpressing <i>Id1</i> under the control of the ubiquitously expressed (<a href=\"#bib54\">Niwa et al., 1991</a>) CAGS promoter. In these cell lines, <i>loxP</i> sites flank the coding sequence for <i>Id1</i> and upon Cre-mediated excision a downstream <i>GFP</i> cassette is expressed. We first confirmed that Id1 is able to block neural induction as expected, and that this phenotype can be reverted by Cre-mediated excision of the <i>Id1</i> transgene (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>).

However, BMP signalling is also necessary for maintenance of pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib11\">Di-Gregorio et al., 2007</a>), and mouse embryos in which BMP has been experimentally overactivated have an impairment in mesoderm differentiation that cannot easily be explained by models in which BMP drives mesoderm differentiation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoyama et al., 2012</a>). Our findings unite these observations by showing how BMP can prime cells for mesoderm fate by imposing a posterior identity, but restrain them from undergoing overt mesoderm formation by suppressing EMT."

It has been proposed (<a href=\"#bib51\">Constance Lane et al., 2004</a>) that BMP antagonism acts by stimulating mediolateral intercalation of caudal progenitors, releasing them to participate in the formation of the axis, and that the normal role of BMP is to preserve a reservoir of progenitors throughout axis elongation. We propose that BMP acts by a similar mechanism during differentiation of pluripotent mouse cells, preserving a population of undifferentiated cells by preventing the loss of Cdh1. The mechanism by which BMP signalling controls EMT will be an interesting area for future study. This may be connected with BMP\u2019s ability to antagonise Nodal signalling, given that Nodal is required for the initiation of EMT at the primitive streak (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Yan et al., 2009</a>)."

It has been known for some time that a subpopulation of ES cells tends to resist neural differentiation, but the reasons for this are not clear. We propose that this subpopulation of cells fail to respond appropriately to a neural-inducing environment because they are unable to downregulate Cdh1. We demonstrate this directly by showing that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity can rescue neural differentiation capacity in this recalcitrant subpopulation resulting in a more homogenous differentiation response. Importantly, this can be achieved by non-genetic means, such as function-blocking E-Cadherin antibodies, providing a convenient and readily applicable means to improve our control over pluripotent cells."

One piece of evidence that argues against this interpretation is that suppression of Cdh1 alone is sufficient to rescue neural differentiation at moderate doses of BMP4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). If the primary effect of BMP is to promote posterior identity, with repression of EMT being a secondary consequence of this, then experimental suppression of Cdh1 in the presence of BMP might be expected to always drive mesoderm rather than neural differentiation. Since this does not happen (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>) we tentatively conclude that repression of \u201cEMT\u201d is not entirely an indirect consequence of the role of BMPs in promoting a posterior epiblast identity. However, we fully accept the wider point that we should be more cautious in our conclusions regarding EMT. We have rewritten our manuscript accordingly as described above."

Whilst it is tempting to interpret this as an inhibition of EMT, these flatted cells do not have the typical morphology of healthy epithelial cells: rather they seem unhealthy, unable to proliferate, and destined to die.

We tested two different doses of BMP4 (10ng/ml and 50ng/ml) with similar results."

We would therefore not feel comfortable drawing any conclusions from these experiments with relation to our proposed model."

A significant proportion (around 50%) of cells lack expression of the flag-tagged transgene on day 5 of differentiation and the flag-negative population are able to generate neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, the differentiation delay is more pronounced with the inducible system than with the constitutive system (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Taken together, these two things make it difficult to use the dox-inducible system to test the eventual lineage preference of overexpressing cells. To strengthen this particular point we therefore turned back to the constitutive overexpression system, which a) allows for more uniform maintenance of Id1 activity throughout the culture (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) and b) allows for a more rapid \u2018escape\u2019 into differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2</a>).
