MAVS forms large prion-like polymers that activate the cytosolic kinases IKK and TBK1, which in turn activate NF-\u03baB and IRF3, respectively, to induce interferons. Here we show that MAVS polymers recruit several TRAF proteins, including TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, through distinct TRAF-binding motifs. Mutations of these motifs that disrupted MAVS binding to TRAFs abrogated its ability to activate IRF3. IRF3 activation was also abolished in cells lacking TRAF2, 5, and 6. These TRAF proteins promoted ubiquitination reactions that recruited NEMO to the MAVS signaling complex, leading to the activation of IKK and TBK1. These results delineate the mechanism of MAVS signaling and reveal that TRAF2, 5, and 6, which are normally associated with NF-\u03baB activation, also play a crucial role in IRF3 activation in antiviral immune responses."

MAVS forms large prion-like polymers that activate the cytosolic kinases IKK and TBK1, which in turn activate NF-\u03baB and IRF3, respectively, to induce interferons. Here we show that MAVS polymers recruit several TRAF proteins, including TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, through distinct TRAF-binding motifs. Mutations of these motifs that disrupted MAVS binding to TRAFs abrogated its ability to activate IRF3. IRF3 activation was also abolished in cells lacking TRAF2, 5, and 6. These TRAF proteins promoted ubiquitination reactions that recruited NEMO to the MAVS signaling complex, leading to the activation of IKK and TBK1. These results delineate the mechanism of MAVS signaling and reveal that TRAF2, 5, and 6, which are normally associated with NF-\u03baB activation, also play a crucial role in IRF3 activation in antiviral immune responses."

To further dissect the mechanism of how MAVS propagates downstream signaling, we performed conventional purification and identified TRAF6 as an IRF3 activator in the presence of activated MAVS. Moreover, by knocking down TRAF6 in <i>Traf</i>2/5-deficient cells, we found that TRAF2 and TRAF5 act redundantly with TRAF6 to activate both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB in response to virus. In addition, we provide evidence that the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 is essential in the TRAF6-dependent activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB, whereas the E3 ligase activity of TRAF2 is redundant with that of LUBAC in the <i>Traf</i>2-dependent pathway downstream of MAVS. Furthermore, mutations of the binding sites for TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 on MAVS abolished the ability of MAVS to activate downstream signaling after virus infection, without affecting its ability to form prion-like polymers. MAVS polymerization mutants, however, failed to recruit TRAFs. Finally, we found that through its ubiquitin-binding domains, NEMO formed a ubiquitination-dependent complex with TRAFs and MAVS, both in vitro and in cells. These results demonstrate a key role of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, which form a ubiquitin-dependent signaling complex with NEMO and the kinases, in propagating antiviral signaling downstream of MAVS."

Q-B also contains the IKK complex; however, IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2 double-deficient MEF cells activated IRF3 normally in response to infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an RNA virus (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, GST-NEMO without its N-terminal IKK-binding site (NEMO\u0394N) rescued IRF3 activity in <i>Nemo<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>(Ikbkg<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>)</i> MEF cell extracts (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating an IKK-independent role of NEMO in virus-induced IRF3 activation. NEMO has been reported to interact with TBK1 through TANK (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhao et al., 2007</a>). Indeed, NEMO\u0394N pulled down endogenous TANK and TBK1 from <i>Nemo<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> cell extracts (NEMO\u0394N PD, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). After NEMO depletion by a NEMO antibody, S100 lost its ability to support IRF3 dimerization in vitro, and the activity was restored by adding back NEMO PD, but not NEMO alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This suggests that NEMO and the TBK1 complex function together in IRF3 activation. However, NEMO\u0394N PD does not fully replace Q-B in IRF3 activation in vitro even in the presence of ubiquitin and E1 (data not shown), indicating that additional factor(s) might be required for IRF3 activation."

                                "text": "To determine whether TRAF6 is important for IRF3 activation in vitro, we performed reconstitution experiments using purified proteins and found that TRAF6 supported IRF3 activation in a manner that depended on MAVS\u0394TM and the ubiquitin system (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Similarly, IRF3 activation by virus-activated mitochondria (P5) was dependent on TRAF6 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Cytosolic extracts from <i>Traf6</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> primary MEF cells were severely, albeit not completely, defective in supporting IRF3 dimerization and I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation in vitro, and these defects were rescued by adding back wild-type TRAF6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). In contrast, TRAF6 RING mutant (TRAF6-C70A), TRAF6 Zinc finger deletion (TRAF6\u0394ZF), or TRAF6 with the TRAF-C domain replaced by a fragment of bacterial gyrase-B (T6RZC) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2001</a>) failed to rescue IRF3 activation in <i>Traf6</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cell extracts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These results suggest that both TRAF6 E3 ligase activity and its ability to interact with other proteins, that is, MAVS (<a href=\"#bib38\">Seth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Xu et al., 2005</a>), are important for IRF3 activation in vitro. However, it has been shown that <i>Traf6</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells exhibited normal virus-induced interferon production (<a href=\"#bib38\">Seth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zeng et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with these reports, <i>Traf6</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> primary MEF cells supported IRF3 and IKK activation in response to Sendai virus infection, but were defective in activating IKK in response to IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Thus, it is possible that other TRAF proteins might also be involved in MAVS signaling. Indeed, crude extracts (S5) from <i>Traf2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>/Traf5</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> (<i>Traf2/5</i> DKO) MEF cells failed to support IRF3 dimerization or I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation in vitro; both activities were restored by adding back wild-type TRAF2 or TRAF5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H,I</a>). Unlike TRAF6, TRAF2 RING deletion (TRAF2\u0394R) did not impair IRF3 dimerization in cytosolic extracts (S5) from <i>Traf2/5</i> DKO cells. In contrast, deletion of the TRAF-C domain from TRAF2 (TRAF2\u0394C) abolished its activity. MEF cells lacking a single TRAF protein, TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF5, were largely normal in activating IRF3 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>)."

Moreover, in contrast to the profound defect of <i>Traf2/5</i> DKO cell extracts in supporting IRF3 and IKK activation by MAVS, the DKO cells activated IRF3 and IKK and induced IFN\u03b2 normally after Sendai virus infection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Importantly, knockdown of TRAF6 expression by short hairpin RNA (shTRAF6) in the DKO cells abolished IRF3 and IKK activation and IFN\u03b2 induction by Sendai virus, but did not impair STAT1 phosphorylation induced by IFN\u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The defects in IRF3 and I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation in the DKO+shTRAF6 cells were rescued by expressing RNAi-resistant WT TRAF6, but not the C70A mutant of TRAF6. Similarly, VSV induction of several cytokines, including IFN\u03b2, IL6, IFN\u03b1, and CXCL10, was abolished in the DKO+shTRAF6 cells but rescued by WT TRAF6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>).

However, we have shown that in <i>Traf</i>3-deficient MEFs, RNA viruses can still activate IRF3 normally and induce IFN\u03b2 at a modestly reduced level (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zeng et al., 2009</a>). To determine if TRAF3 functions redundantly with other TRAF proteins, we knocked down TRAF3 in <i>Traf2/Traf5</i> DKO MEFs and found that VSV induced IFN\u03b2 and IL6 normally in these cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G</a>). Similarly, knocking down TRAF6 in <i>Traf</i>3-deficient MEFs did not impair IRF3 activation by Sendai virus (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>).

To test the role of LUBAC in MAVS signaling, we used shRNA to knock down each individual subunit of the LUBAC complex, HOIP, HOIL-1, and Sharpin, as well as MAVS or TRAF3 in wild-type MEF cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). As expected, the knockdown of MAVS blocked IRF3 activation and IFN\u03b2 induction by VSV. The knockdown of HOIL-1 slightly enhanced IRF3 activation and IFN\u03b2 induction as compared to the control cells, consistent with its role as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling (<a href=\"#bib16\">Inn et al., 2011</a>). However, the knockdown of HOIP, Sharpin, or TRAF3 did not appreciably affect IRF3 activation and modestly inhibited IFN\u03b2 induction by VSV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). A previous report showed that IFN\u03b2 induction is enhanced in MEF cells derived from the mouse strain <i>Sharpin<sup>cpdm</sup></i>, which is deficient in Sharpin expression (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belgnaoui et al., 2012</a>). Contrary to this report, we found that loss of Sharpin slightly reduced IFN\u03b2 induction by VSV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). At later time points, Sharpin deficiency partially reduced IFN\u03b2 induction by VSV and Sendai virus (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Re-introducing Sharpin back into <i>Sharpin</i>-deficient MEFs did not inhibit or enhance the activation of IRF3 or IKK by Sendai virus (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Consistent with our model that LUBAC is not a negative regulator of MAVS signaling, tetracycline-inducible knockdown of HOIP in the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS modestly inhibited the activation of IRF3 and induction of IFN\u03b2 by VSV (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>)."

The motif PVQET (143\u2013147) is known to bind TRAF2 and TRAF5, and perhaps TRAF3, whereas two motifs, PGENSE (153\u2013158) and PEENEY (455\u2013460) bind TRAF6. The second TRAF6-binding motif has also been suggested to bind TRAF3 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Paz et al., 2011</a>). We showed previously that TRAF6 and TRAF2 shifted to high-molecular weight fractions together with MAVS polymers in response to Sendai virus infection (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hou et al., 2011</a>). Here, we examined whether mutations in MAVS that selectively disrupt its binding to specific TRAF proteins affect the downstream signaling. <i>Mavs</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs stably expressing MAVS mutants were infected with Sendai virus followed by immunoblotting to examine IRF3 dimerization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>) or q-RT-PCR to measure cytokine expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Mutations of the TRAF2/3/5 (Q145N) or TRAF6 [E155D/E457D (2ED)] binding sites did not affect IRF3 activation by Sendai virus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast, mutations of all known TRAF-binding sites (QN2ED) abolished IRF3 activation. Similarly, QN2ED, but not Q145N or 2ED, mutations in MAVS abolished IFN\u03b2 and IL-6 induction by Sendai virus. QN2ED MAVS also permitted higher levels of VSV replication (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>). To confirm the specificity of the TRAF-binding motifs in MAVS, endogenous MAVS was knocked down by shRNA in <i>Traf6</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) or <i>Traf2/5</i> DKO (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>) MEFs, which were then rescued with different RNAi-resistant MAVS mutants. These cells were complemented with either Flag-TRAF6 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) or Flag-TRAF2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody revealed that the TRAF6 complex from the virus-infected cells contained WT and Q145N MAVS, but not 2ED or QN2ED MAVS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). In contrast, the TRAF2 complex contained WT and 2ED MAVS, but not Q145N or QN2ED MAVS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Like WT MAVS, the QN2ED mutant formed high molecular weight aggregates after virus infection (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggesting that its inability to activate IRF3 is likely due to defective recruitment of TRAF proteins rather than a defect in polymerization."

In <i>Traf6</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells, Q145N but not 2ED MAVS was completely defective in inducing IFN\u03b2, but this defect was rescued by ectopic expression of WT but not C70A TRAF6 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). These results indicate that a functional TRAF6 was indispensable for signaling through the two TRAF6-binding sites (i.e., no other TRAF proteins, such as TRAF3, could substitute the function of TRAF6). In <i>Traf2/5</i> DKO cells, 2ED but not Q145N MAVS was defective in inducing IFN\u03b2, but this defect was rescued by WT TRAF2 and partially rescued by the C34A and RING-deleted mutant of TRAF2 (TRAF2\u0394RING) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). In <i>Traf2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> or <i>Traf5</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells, only QN2ED MAVS failed to rescue IFN\u03b2 induction, suggesting that TRAF2 and TRAF5 could functionally substitute each other (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). Similar to WT cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), <i>Traf3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells could support IRF3 activation by WT, Q145N, and 2ED MAVS, but not QN2ED MAVS (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In contrast, <i>Traf6</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells could not support IRF3 activation by Q145N MAVS. Taken together (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), these results strongly support the conclusion that MAVS signals through its specific TRAF-binding motifs that recruit TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, which then function in parallel to activate IRF3 and NF-\u03baB."

Each of these mutations abrogated the ability of MAVS to induce an IFN\u03b2 luciferase (IFN\u03b2-Luc) reporter gene stably integrated in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). WT or the mutant MAVS proteins were stably expressed in <i>Mavs</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs, which were infected with Sendai virus followed by analysis of IRF3 dimerization. MAVS polymerization was analyzed by semidenaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hou et al., 2011</a>). Unlike wild-type MAVS, which activated IRF3 and formed SDS-resistant aggregates following viral infection, MAVS containing point mutations in the CARD domain failed to activate IRF3 or form aggregates. Similarly, in HEK293T cells in which endogenous MAVS was knocked down by shRNA and replaced by RNAi-resistant MAVS WT or CARD mutants, only WT MAVS activated IRF3 after Sendai virus infection and formed high molecular weight particles that sedimented to the bottom layers after sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Importantly, each of the point mutations in MAVS CARD abolished the virus-induced interaction between TRAF6 and MAVS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The mutations that disrupt MAVS polymerization also abrogated its binding to TRAF2 and TRAF5 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). These results strongly suggest that MAVS polymerization is important for the recruitment of TRAF6, TRAF2, TRAF5, and likely other signaling molecules."

To identify ubiquitination target(s) that relays upstream signal to NEMO, we incubated Flag-NEMO with HeLa S100 in the presence of MAVS\u0394TM.

The MAVS-TRAF2-NEMO interaction was blocked when a deubiquitination enzyme, which contains the ovarian tumor type (OTU) domain of the Crimean Congo hemorrahagic fever virus, was included in the reaction mixture. Moreover, a NEMO mutant (UBDm; Y308S/H413A/C417A), which contained point mutations in both ubiquitin-binding domains, failed to pull down the TRAF2-MAVS complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

At present, we do not know why some proteins such as TRAF6, TRAF3, and A20 interacted with NEMO only in the \u2018in vivo\u2019 but not the in vitro SILAC, whereas the LUBAC subunits behaved oppositely. One possibility is that these proteins interact with NEMO in a dynamic manner, which is recapitulated differently between the in vitro and \u2018in vivo\u2019 experiments. In any case, as TRAF2 was recruited to NEMO in a manner that depended on MAVS, VSV, and UBD of NEMO, we investigated whether ubiquitination of TRAF2 plays a role in MAVS signaling. We incubated Flag-tagged mouse TRAF2 with S100 from <i>Traf2/5</i> DKO MEFs in the presence of MAVS\u0394TM, followed by Flag immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Five ubiquitination sites on TRAF2 were detected by mass spectrometry, including K31, K148, K195, K313, and K481 as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>. Among these lysines, K31 was identified as an autoubiquitination site of TRAF2 in the TNF pathway (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2009</a>). We mutated these lysine residues to arginine in TRAF2 (T2-5KR), and stably expressed the mutants as well as the WT TRAF2 in <i>Traf2/5</i> DKO+shTRAF6 MEFs. Both WT and 5KR TRAF2 rescued the induction of IFN\u03b2, IL6, and CXCL10 by VSV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>). Further mutation of another lysine (K38; to generate 6KR) also did not impair the function of TRAF2 (data not shown). Interestingly, knockdown of HOIP abolished the expression of these cytokines in cells expressing TRAF2-5KR, but not wild type TRAF2. These results, together with the results shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, suggest that ubiquitinated TRAF2 may function redundantly with another ubiquitination target of HOIP."

We found that <i>Nemo</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEF cells stably expressing NEMO K285/309R mutant produced IFN\u03b2 and IL6 after VSV infection and that the cytokine levels were similar to those produced by cells expressing wild-type NEMO (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). In contrast, the cells expressing NEMO-UBDm failed to induce the cytokines after VSV infection.

These results suggest that NEMO ubiquitination per se is dispensable for IRF3 activation in the MAVS pathway. It is likely that ubiquitination of multiple targets as well as unanchored K63 polyubiquitin chains function cooperatively to recruit NEMO and other signaling molecules to the MAVS polymers and promote the activation of IKK and TBK1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

                        "text": "Although it is known that MAVS contains binding sites for several TRAF proteins (<a href=\"#bib38\">Seth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Xu et al., 2005</a>), the role of these TRAF proteins in MAVS signaling has been enigmatic because cells lacking an individual TRAF protein, including TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6, could still induce IFN\u03b2 normally in response to virus infection (<a href=\"#bib38\">Seth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Konno et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zeng et al., 2009</a>). In this report, we demonstrated that compound deletion of TRAF6, TRAF2, and TRAF5 completely abolished IFN\u03b2 induction by Sendai virus and VSV, suggesting that these proteins function redundantly in vivo to activate the downstream signaling cascades after they are recruited to the cognate binding sites on MAVS. Such redundant function of the TRAF proteins was not recapitulated in our cell free assay, in which IRF3 activation by MAVS was strongly inhibited in <i>Traf</i>6-deficient extracts, and largely abolished in the absence of TRAF2 and TRAF5. It is possible that certain aspects of cell signaling in intact cells, such as the potential involvement of cellular structures (e.g., membrane organelles) and transcriptional amplification, are not recapitulated in the in vitro system that employs soluble cytosolic extracts. Nevertheless, the in vitro assay recapitulates many aspects of MAVS signaling, such as its dependency on MAVS and NEMO. In the assay that involves endogenous MAVS, IRF3 activation occurs only when cytosolic extracts are incubated with mitochondria from virus-infected cells. Thus, the in vitro assays that we have established are valuable tools to dissect the biochemical mechanisms of MAVS signaling. Our finding that MAVS recruits multiple ubiquitin E3 ligases and other signaling proteins to activate IKK and TBK1 further underscores the importance of combining in vitro biochemical approach with cell-based assays to gain a mechanistic understanding of these complex signaling pathways."

                        "text": "Currently, the prevailing view is that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 mediate the activation of IKK and NF-\u03baB, whereas TRAF3 is important for the activation of TBK1 and IRF3. However, here we showed that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are essential for the activation of both IKK and TBK1 by MAVS, whereas TRAF3 is dispensable. Paz et al. have recently shown that the TRAF6-binding site (455-PEENEY-460) of MAVS also binds to TRAF3 and that this binding is important for MAVS signaling (<a href=\"#bib31\">Paz et al., 2011</a>). Another recent report confirmed that the PEENEY motif (residues 455\u2013460) of MAVS is important for IFN\u03b2 induction when an intermediate domain of MAVS is fused to an artificial oligomerization domain (<a href=\"#bib42\">Takamatsu et al., 2013</a>). However, this study did not directly investigate whether TRAF6 or TRAF3 is important for MAVS signaling. Our data showed that in cells expressing a MAVS mutant lacking the TRAF2/5 binding sites (Q145N), activation of IRF3 and production of IFN\u03b2 were completely abolished in cells depleted of TRAF6, indicating that other TRAF proteins, including TRAF3, could not substitute the function of TRAF6. It is possible that the role of TRAF3 in IRF3 activation depends on the cell types and specific signaling pathways. Alternatively, TRAF3 may regulate type-I interferon production through a mechanism that does not affect IRF3 activation."

A possible explanation for these observations is that IRF3 activation requires certain adaptor proteins such as MAVS, STING, and TRIF. Indeed, we have recently shown that STING simultaneously binds to TBK1 and IRF3, thereby specifying IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tanaka and Chen, 2012</a>). This mechanism explains why several innate immunity pathways, such as the TLR and IL-1 pathways, could lead to activation of TBK1 but not IRF3 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Clark et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "Our model that MAVS signals through multiple TRAF proteins is further supported by mutagenesis experiments which showed that mutations of both TRAF2/5 and TRAF6 binding sites of MAVS, but not each alone, abolished IRF3 and IKK activation by virus infection. Importantly, MAVS binds to the TRAF proteins in a manner that depends on virus infection and MAVS polymerization. Mutations in the CARD domain of MAVS that disrupt its polymerization also abolish the recruitment of the TRAF proteins. These results explain why MAVS undergoes prion-like polymerization in response to viral infections. Presumably, each TRAF binding motif of MAVS has a low affinity for the TRAF proteins, but the polymerization of MAVS significantly increases the avidity of the interaction, resulting in the recruitment of the TRAF proteins. The recruitment of TRAFs to the MAVS polymers may lead to the oligomerization of TRAFs, which activates their ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sun et al., 2004</a>). The E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 is likely important for IRF3 activation because mutation of the RING domain in TRAF6 abolishes its activity. Interestingly, the RING domain of TRAF2 is important for IRF3 activation only when the catalytic activity of HOIP is abrogated, suggesting that TRAF2 and HOIP may have redundant functions. HOIP is dispensable for IRF3 activation in cells expressing TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6. Conversely, the loss of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 completely abolishes IRF3 activation in cells expressing other E3s such as LUBAC, cIAPs, and TRAF3. These results indicate that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are the major E3s that mediate the activation of IKK and TBK1 downstream of MAVS."

                        "text": "How do TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 activate IKK and TBK1? Both IKK and TBK1 employ NEMO as an essential regulatory subunit for their activation. NEMO contains two ubiquitin-binding domains, which are essential for the activation of IKK and TBK1 in response to virus infection. Although we could detect ubiquitination of NEMO at multiple lysines, mutations of these lysines to arginine did not impair the ability of NEMO to support IRF3 activation by MAVS. In fact, a NEMO mutant containing mutations at 13 conserved lysine residues (13KR) could still activate IRF3 in the presence of MAVS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). We also found that TRAF2 is recruited to NEMO in a manner that depends on ubiquitination and MAVS. TRAF2 is also ubiquitinated at multiple lysine residues. However, mutations of these residues to arginine did not impair its ability to induce cytokines in response to VSV infection unless HOIP was also depleted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>). Thus, HOIP may have an additional ubiquitination target that functions redundantly with TRAF2 ubiquitination to mediate IRF3 activation. An emerging theme from this work is that multiple ubiquitin E3s are recruited to MAVS, and each E3 targets ubiquitination of distinct proteins, which function cooperatively and redundantly to activate IKK and TBK1. A similar model has recently been proposed for the regulation of DNA repair by sumoylation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Psakhye and Jentsch, 2012</a>). It was shown that sumoylation of a group of DNA repair proteins (\u2018protein group\u2019), rather than a specific protein target, is responsible for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks."

This vector was modified to pTY-shRNA-EF1a-hygroR-GFP and pTY-shRNA-EF1a-zeroR-GFP by replacing the puromycin resistant gene with hygromycin- and zeocin-resistant genes, respectively, such that multiple lentiviral vectors can be introduced to the same cell line. The original vector was also modified to pTY-shRNA-EF1a-GFP-IRES-puroR to circumvent the problem of incomplete cleavage by the 2A protease. The shRNA sequences were cloned into the vectors with U6 promoter. RNAi-resistant cDNA sequences were cloned into the vectors to replace GFP. Lentiviral infection and establishment of stable cells were described previously (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tanaka and Chen, 2012</a>).

All SILAC reagents were purchased from Pierce (Thermo Scientific). The in vitro and cell-based SILAC experiments were preformed according to the outline described in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>, respectively. After SDS-PAGE and silver staining, 10 to 12 gel slices from each lane were excised and digested with trypsin in situ. Extracted peptides were fractionated on a homemade analytical column (75 \u03bcm ID, 100 mm in length) packed with C18 resin (100 \u00c5, 3 \u03bcm, MICHROM Bioresources) using Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Thermo Scientific). The column was coupled in-line to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source, which was set at a spray voltage of 2.3 kV. Peptides were eluted with a 78 min gradient as follows: 2\u201330% B in 68 min, 30\u201335% B in 4 min, 35\u201340% B in 2 min, 40\u201360% B in 3 min, and 60\u201380% B in 1 min (A = 0.1% formic acid; B = 100% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid). Full scan mass spectra were acquired from <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 300 to 1500 with a resolution of 70,000 at <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> = 200 in the Orbitrap. MS/MS spectra (resolution: 17,500 at <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> = 200) were acquired in a data-dependent mode, whereby the top 10 most abundant parent ions were subjected to further fragmentation by higher energy collision dissociation (HCD). SILAC data were processed using MaxQuant computational platform (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cox and Mann, 2008</a>) version 1.3.0.5 which incorporates the Andromeda search engine (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cox et al., 2011</a>). Proteins were identified by searching the mouse UniProt database supplemented with frequently observed contaminants. The first search tolerance was set at 20 ppm, and main search deviation at 6 ppm. The required minimum peptide length was six amino acids. The false discovery rate (FDR) at both peptide and protein levels was set to 0.01. SILAC quantification of each protein group was based on at least two ratio counts."

Upon innate immune detection of cytoplasmic viral RNA by RIG-I receptors, MAVS, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, polymerizes and signals NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activation through IKK and TBK1 kinases. This process critically requires ubiquitination, but the nature of the ubiquitination events and the roles of TRAF-family ubiquitin ligases have been controversial and are not clearly defined. In this study, the authors employed cell-free reconstitution and biochemical fraction approaches, and identified TRAF6 being one of the key ubiquitin ligases in mediating MAVS activation of both NF-\u03baB and IRF3 signaling. Using viral infection of different TRAF KO MEFs, the authors further discovered that TRAF2/5, but not TRAF3, play a redundant role with TRAF6 and function cooperatively with TRAF6 to mediate ubiquitination signaling upon MAVS activation. Importantly, all three TRAFs (TRAF2/5/6) are recruited to MAVS upon viral RNA-induced MAVS polymerization, and only when all three TRAFs are depleted is MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling completely blocked. This clarifies the role of different TRAF ubiquitin ligases in MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling. Moreover, the study also demonstrates that K63-linked ubiquitin chains, sensed simultaneously by the two ubiquitin-binding domains in NEMO, play a pre-dominant role in MAVS activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 signaling through IKK/TBK1. These findings are of great interest and certainly seem to advance our understanding of the RIG-I-MAVS antiviral signaling. The study is carefully designed and performed, the evidences provided are quite thorough and complete, and the conclusion drawn is reasonably justified. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication:"

While knockdown of HOIL-1 led to a modest enhancement of IRF3 activation and IFN? induction, knockdown of HOIP or Sharpin in WT MEF cells did not affect IRF3 activation and only modestly inhibited IFN? induction. The positive role of HOIP and Sharpin in IRF3 activation was revealed only in cells expressing TRAF2?RING, but not WT TRAF2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>\u2013figure supplement 1I), supporting our model that HOIP and Sharpin function redundantly with the E3 activity of TRAF2. Overall, our results are consistent with those of Inn et al. that HOIL-1 is a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling (Mol Cell 41:354), but contradict with those of Belgnaoui et al. who showed that Sharpin negatively regulates the RIG-I pathway (Cell Host &amp; Microbe 12:211). To further investigate the role of Sharpin in the RIG-I pathway, we infected the <i>Sharpin</i>-deficient (cpdm) MEFs with VSV and Sendai virus (SeV) for different time points (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>\u2013figure supplement 1C). In each case, IFN? induction by the viruses was significantly reduced in the absence of Sharpin. We also used tetracycline-inducible RNAi to knock down HOIP in U2OS cells and found that IFN? induction by VSV was partially inhibited in the absence of HOIP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>\u2013figure supplement 1E\u20131G). Thus, in multiple independent experiments involving different cell lines, viruses and time courses, we consistently found that HOIP and Sharpin played a positive, albeit not indispensable, role in the RIG-I pathway."

Our in vitro assay largely recapitulates the K63 polyubiquitination-dependent pathways, but not the linear polyubiquitination-dependent pathway.
