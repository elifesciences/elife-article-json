While the molecular interactions between TCR and its ligands are well characterized in vitro, quantitative measurements of these interactions in living cells are required to accurately resolve the physical mechanisms of TCR signaling. We report direct single molecule measurements of TCR triggering by agonist pMHC in hybrid junctions between live primary T cells and supported lipid membranes. Every pMHC:TCR complex over the entire cell is tracked while simultaneously monitoring the local membrane recruitment of ZAP70, as a readout of TCR triggering. Mean dwell times for pMHC:TCR molecular binding of 5 and 54 s were measured for two different pMHC:TCR systems. Single molecule measurements of the pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complex indicate that TCR triggering is stoichiometric with agonist pMHC in a 1:1 ratio. Thus any signal amplification must occur downstream of TCR triggering."

While the molecular interactions between TCR and its ligands are well characterized in vitro, quantitative measurements of these interactions in living cells are required to accurately resolve the physical mechanisms of TCR signaling. We report direct single molecule measurements of TCR triggering by agonist pMHC in hybrid junctions between live primary T cells and supported lipid membranes. Every pMHC:TCR complex over the entire cell is tracked while simultaneously monitoring the local membrane recruitment of ZAP70, as a readout of TCR triggering. Mean dwell times for pMHC:TCR molecular binding of 5 and 54 s were measured for two different pMHC:TCR systems. Single molecule measurements of the pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complex indicate that TCR triggering is stoichiometric with agonist pMHC in a 1:1 ratio. Thus any signal amplification must occur downstream of TCR triggering."

T cells are key components of the immune system, and each has a unique variant of a signalling complex known as the T cell receptor on its surface. T cells scan the surfaces of other cells in search of antigens, which are peptides (fragments of proteins) that derive from foreign pathogens such as viruses. Successful recognition of a foreign peptide leads to an immune response that, in most cases, ultimately rids the body of the pathogen. Most importantly, however, the immune system must be able to discriminate between peptides that are produced naturally in the body (\u2018self\u2019 peptides) and foreign or \u2018non-self\u2019 peptides. This is challenging because self peptides may have similar structures to non-self peptides and are often much more abundant."

These interactions are long-lived and ultimately result in the recruitment of ZAP70, which has an important role in the activation of T cells, to the complex formed by the T cell, the peptide and the MHC molecule. Therefore, any amplification of the activating signal transmitted by non-self peptides occurs following receptor binding, in contrast to previous models."

Fewer than 10 agonist pMHC molecules can trigger T cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Irvine et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Manz et al., 2011</a>), and the signaling response occurs on a timescale of seconds (<a href=\"#bib18a\">Huse et al., 2007</a>). It has been recognized for decades that subtle, peptide-specific differences in binding parameters, especially kinetic rates for the pMHC and T cell receptor (TCR) reaction, seem to be the basis of antigen recognition (<a href=\"#bib27\">Matsui et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tian et al., 2007</a>). Experimental correlations between molecular pMHC:TCR binding kinetics, typically determined from solution assays of soluble extracellular domains and bulk measurements of T cell activity, have provided the foundation for much of this understanding."

For example, the maximum affinity a TCR can have for self pMHC ligands (non-triggering) is sharply defined and close to the affinity threshold for foreign pMHC (triggering). Consequently, every TCR is likely to bind a subset of the ever-present self pMHC molecules with affinities differing only slightly from genuine foreign agonist pMHC. If TCR triggering and signaling were simply proportional to TCR occupancy by ligand, then the abundance of self pMHC could easily overwhelm genuine agonist signals, rendering this as an ineffective discriminatory mechanism. Alternatively, each engagement of pMHC with TCR (serial triggering; <a href=\"#bib40\">Valitutti et al., 1995</a>), perhaps with some minimum engagement time (kinetic proof reading; <a href=\"#bib28\">McKeithan, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rabinowitz et al., 1996</a>), might define the threshold for TCR triggering. Other proposed mechanisms elaborate further, suggesting (pseudo) heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib19\">Irvine et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Krogsgaard et al., 2005</a>) of self and agonist pMHC molecules or pMHC-independent forms of trans activation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cooper and Qian, 2008</a>) of multiple TCR by a single agonist pMHC may be at work. Proving or disproving any of these various possibilities based on current data is confounded by the vast difference between ensemble biochemical measurements and cell population behavior. Substantial ambiguity with respect to the actual molecular mechanisms responsible for antigen triggering of T cells remains. A physically accurate understanding of this remarkable process will require simultaneous observations of the molecular binding kinetics, stoichiometry, and movement of individual signaling complexes in living T cells."

Every pMHC can be individually resolved and tracked for up to minutes before photobleaching by using a multi-timescale single molecule fluorescence imaging approach. Key to this strategy is the variable control of excitation light dose and exposure time to achieve hardware discrimination of molecular species with different mobilities. The pMHC molecules fall into two unambiguously distinguished classes: one undergoing fast random motion and the second moving slowly along linear trajectories. These slow moving pMHC are the bound pMHC:TCR complexes; they are only observed with agonist peptide and they spatially correlate with both TCR and recruitment of ZAP70. The linear trajectories of the pMHC:TCR complexes match the well-characterized cytoskeleton-driven movement of TCR during the formation of the immunological synapse (<a href=\"#bib5\">Campi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yokosuka et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">DeMond et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yu et al., 2012</a>). Thus a lone agonist pMHC bound to TCR leads to stable engagement of the resulting complex with the cytoskeleton. Single molecule intensity calibration of the number of ZAP70 recruited to the vicinity of each agonist pMHC indicates that TCR are triggered in a 1:1 stoichiometry with pMHC."

Individual dwell times are roughly exponentially distributed and are in general agreement with bulk solution measurements of pMHC:TCR kinetic off-rates for both TCRs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Corse et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Huppa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Newell et al., 2011</a>). However, dwell times measured from tracking experiments specifically correspond to spatial entrapment of pMHC with a TCR, or cluster of TCRs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Schamel and Alarcon, 2013</a>), on the T cell surface. They do not necessarily correspond to individual molecular binding events with a single TCR. Indeed, recent studies (e.g., by FRET) have suggested that pMHC:TCR kinetic off-rates may be accelerated in living cells relative to in vitro measurements, possibly as a result of actively applied forces from the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Huppa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>). We explore the possibility that individual dwell times observed by tracking experiments could be composed of rapid unbinding and serial rebinding of pMHC to multiple TCR within a cluster. Results from a stochastic reaction-diffusion analysis, covering a wide range of parameter space, indicate that serial rebinding alone is unlikely to sustain entrapment. If pMHC thoroughly disengages from TCR, it will most likely escape. Structural flexibility within the pMHC:TCR complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hawse et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Reboul et al., 2012</a>) could give rise to apparently fast kinetics (e.g., in FRET measurements) without actual unbinding of pMHC from TCR. The tracking observations reported here directly reveal that the functional interaction between agonist pMHC and TCR is long-lived in living cells and that triggered TCR remain localized with the same pMHC."

Using a dual-view system in which chromatic aberrations have been mapped (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), spatial colocalization between the two channels to less than 105 nm is achieved. Immediately after cell landing, ZAP70 localizes to and moves together with the pMHC:TCR complexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2 and 3</a>). For each frame in a tracking sequence, fluorescence intensity in the ZAP70-EGFP channel is integrated over a 315 nm square region centered on each pMHC:TCR complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The resulting intensity traces reveal discrete changes in average intensity, which we attribute to the binding of one ZAP70-EGFP to the phosphorylated ITAM domains on the cytoplasmic side of TCR engaged with pMHC (<a href=\"#bib20\">Iwashima et al., 1994</a>). Representative traces of colocalized ZAP70-EGFP intensity along with the corresponding intensity trace from the pMHC are illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>. Stochastic transitions are identified using a change-point algorithm (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ensign and Pande, 2009</a>) and results from this analysis are superimposed on the raw intensity traces. Observed molecular binding dwell times of individual ZAP70-EGFP, as resolved by the stochastic transitions, range from 12 to 107 s. The majority of single molecule ZAP70-EGFP traces exhibit intensity fluctuations consistent with background (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), which would not be expected if cytosolic ZAP70-EGFP exchanged during exposure time. These dwell times are slightly longer than estimates of \u223c10 s obtained from bulk fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bunnell et al., 2002</a>).

For example, the average ZAP70-EGFP feature intensity per frame (136.0 counts \u00b1 0.04 SEM, integrated over a 315 nm square area for each feature) for the cell shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> corresponds to 2.9 \u00b1 0.04 SEM ZAP70-EGFP per feature, given that the single molecule intensity is 47 \u00b1 2 counts (SEM; n = 6) in that cell. Each feature therefore contains on average \u223c6 ZAP70 molecules, since ZAP70-EGFP was expressed in a roughly 1:1 ratio with endogenous ZAP70 (selected by FACS and confirmed by western blotting) in these experiments. Each TCR complex has 10 ITAM domains that, when phosphorylated, can bind one ZAP70 each (<a href=\"#bib43\">Weiss and Littman, 1994</a>). Thus observation of \u223c6 ZAP70 per agonist pMHC suggests only a single TCR is triggered."

The observation of a range of ZAP70-EGFP stoichiometries (from 1 to \u223c10 ZAP70-EGFP per pMHC:TCR complex) implies that some time-dependent accumulation of ZAP70 is likely to occur, although we have not definitively observed ZAP70-EGFP accumulation over time within individual intensity traces. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that engagement of TCR with an individual agonist pMHC molecule leads to stable association with the actin cytoskeleton, one-to-one TCR triggering (ITAM phosphorylation), and subsequent ZAP70 recruitment. Moreover, since every pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complex is individually resolved in these experiments, we demonstrate that a single pMHC:TCR complex can lead to TCR triggering without molecular-scale association with other MHC molecules."

Thus, although our measured dwell times in live cells are in general agreement with bulk solution measurements of pMHC:TCR kinetic off-rates for both TCRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Corse et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Newell et al., 2011</a>), this may not result from the same reasons in each case. Unbinding of pMHC from TCR followed by rapid rebinding to the same TCR or another TCR within the same signaling cluster could conceivably lead to entrapment of pMHC for timescales longer than the lifetime of the molecular interaction. This has been hypothesized as a potential mode by which a small number of agonist pMHC could trigger a larger number of TCR (<a href=\"#bib13\">Govern et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Huppa et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, recently reported single molecule measurements of pMHC:TCR binding kinetics in live cells, by force probe and by FRET, have suggested accelerated kinetic-off rates (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Huppa et al., 2010</a>).

We note that although TCR clusters are not readily visible at the low antigen densities in these experiments, low level TCR clustering has been reported in the resting state by other methods (<a href=\"#bib35\">Schamel and Alarcon, 2013</a>). Even with a very fast <i>k</i><sub><i>on</i></sub>, if pMHC completely disengages from TCR for long enough to diffuse to an adjacent TCR, then the probability of complete escape from the TCR cluster is high. Only in the extreme limit, where <i>k</i><sub><i>on</i></sub> is so fast that pMHC unbinding is predominantly followed by rebinding to the same TCR, is the escape time appreciably longer than the individual molecular dwell times. The distinction between rapidly rebinding the same TCR and a single engagement is largely semantic. However, it may reveal something about the mechanical stability of pMHC:TCR interactions, and could account for the apparently accelerated <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub> observed in other types of experiments<b>.</b>"

Subsequent recruitment of ZAP70 indicates TCR are triggered and movement of the complexes along linear trajectories confirms stable association with the actin cytoskeleton. All of this occurs as a result of a lone agonist pMHC binding TCR, without involvement of other MHC. The measured average pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 stoichiometry indicates TCR triggering is most likely 1:1 with agonist pMHC. Supernumerary triggering of multiple TCR by a single pMHC is not observed on the timescales of minutes investigated in these experiments. The original serial triggering model (<a href=\"#bib40\">Valitutti et al., 1995</a>) drew its conclusions from the extent of TCR down regulation measured 5 hr after exposure of T cells to antigen-pulsed APCs. Additionally, the lack of molecular-scale cooperativity in TCR triggering by agonist pMHC indicates that observed cooperativity at the level of cellular calcium response, at similar ligand densities and timescales (<a href=\"#bib26\">Manz et al., 2011</a>), is most likely due to intracellular feedback mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib1a\">Altan-Bonnet and Germain, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5a\">Chan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8a\">Das et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38a\">Stefanov\u00e1 et al., 2003</a>)."

The authors examine the interactions between pMHC and TCR, at a single molecule level, which provides a direct measurement on the association times of this complex. They also examine how the pMHC-TCR complex recruits ZAP70, which is a direct measure of triggering and the initiation of signal transduction. This is a very nicely executed two color, single molecule experiment. There are several interesting findings: 1) the TCR-pMHC act as discrete entities and do not appear to aggregate; 2) the association times differ 10-fold for two different peptide agonists, revealing distinct information encoded by off-rates; 3) the dissociation rates are much slower than was previously reported by a live cell FRET measurement (the new data are more direct and believable, and the information will be important for the field); 4) Virtually all pMHC-TCR complexes become immobilized and hook onto the actin cytoskeleton; and 5) each pMHC-TCR recruits several ZAP70 molecules and these complexes also are extremely long lived."

Thus although much of the data presented was acquired under conditions that do indeed select against short-term interactions, we have also done the corresponding high-speed measurements (see, for example, the single molecule trace in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The fast pMHC:TCR kinetics reported in Huppa et al., are still an order of magnitude slower than our fastest time resolution (17.5 ms); such fast events are not likely to be missed in these tracking experiments using the fast exposure times."

                    "text": "We devote several analyses in the manuscript towards possible differences in what is measured by tracking vs. smFRET. Specifically, we consider (and rule out) serial rebinding of a single pMHC to multiple TCR in a TCR cluster (\u201cStochastic reaction-diffusion simulations\u201d). In the Discussion (paragraphs 3 and 4) we suggest structural flexibility within the pMHC:TCR complex could explain the differing observations, particularly since the fast kinetics are only observed when the pMHC:TCR complexes are under strain. This could easily obliterate a smFRET signal even without the complex fully disengaging (<a href=\"#bib25\">Majumdar et al., 2007</a>). Such flexibility is supported by recent structural analyses of pMHC:TCR (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hawse et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Reboul et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, with the information at hand, we suggest this is the most likely explanation. It is important to note that our measurements agree with solution SPR measurements (<a href=\"#bib7\">Corse et al. 2010</a> &amp; ; <a href=\"#bib29\">Newell et al. 2011</a>) and with in vivo requirements for negative selection (<a href=\"#bib44\">Williams et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Palmer &amp; Naeher, 2009</a>) for two different TCR. We do not analyze measurements made with a different pMHC:TCR combination (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huang et al., 2010</a>) in detail because they are not directly comparable."

The difference is more pronounced for the MCC-AND interaction, 54 s vs 81 s at 24 and 37\u00b0C, respectively. We observe a slight temperature effect in the 5c.c7 system; however, the intrinsic experimental error in comparing the dwell time distributions at 24 and 37\u00b0C is higher for shorter interactions. The effect is also easier to see for the MCC-AND interaction because there are more MCC-AND complexes per T cell (data not shown). It is also possible that changes in cellular behavior in response to temperature could also affect these measurements in ways that are not observed in solution measurements with purified components. At 24\u00b0C T cells have a smaller surface area on the supported membrane than at 37\u00b0C, are slower to land, and also have decreased lamellipodial motion. These factors could affect the environment of the pMHC:TCR interaction in unpredictable ways and perhaps could compensate for the direct temperature effect on molecular interactions."

The distribution of ZAP70-EGFP intensities (from single ZAP70 molecules up to \u223c10) implies that time-dependent ZAP70-EGFP accumulation must occur, but we have not definitively observed accumulation of ZAP70-EGFP over time in one intensity trace. The observation of single molecule ZAP70-EGFP accumulation in a single intensity trace (i.e., several consecutive step intensity increases) is technically challenging due to the convolution of several time-dependent processes: MCC-Atto647N bleaching, ZAP70-EGFP bleaching, pMHC:TCR unbinding, ZAP70-ITAM binding, and ZAP70-ITAM unbinding. We do, however, make the bulk observation that the brightest ZAP70-EGFP features are observed at later time points. The text has been clarified accordingly (\u201cTCR triggering monitored by ZAP70 recruitment\u201d)."
