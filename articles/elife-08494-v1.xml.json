A key question emerges regarding how this behaviour contributes to tissue phenotype, but it has been a challenge to quantitatively analyse this in living cells over time, as opposed to studying snap-shots of gene expression state. We have used imaging of reporter gene expression to track transcription in living pituitary tissue. We integrated live-cell imaging data with statistical modelling for quantitative real-time estimation of the timing of switching between transcriptional states across a whole tissue. Multiple levels of transcription rate were identified, indicating that gene expression is not a simple binary \u2018on-off\u2019 process. Immature tissue displayed shorter durations of high-expressing states than the adult. In adult pituitary tissue, direct cell contacts involving gap junctions allowed local spatial coordination of prolactin gene expression. Our findings identify how heterogeneous transcriptional dynamics of single cells may contribute to overall tissue behaviour."

A key question emerges regarding how this behaviour contributes to tissue phenotype, but it has been a challenge to quantitatively analyse this in living cells over time, as opposed to studying snap-shots of gene expression state. We have used imaging of reporter gene expression to track transcription in living pituitary tissue. We integrated live-cell imaging data with statistical modelling for quantitative real-time estimation of the timing of switching between transcriptional states across a whole tissue. Multiple levels of transcription rate were identified, indicating that gene expression is not a simple binary \u2018on-off\u2019 process. Immature tissue displayed shorter durations of high-expressing states than the adult. In adult pituitary tissue, direct cell contacts involving gap junctions allowed local spatial coordination of prolactin gene expression. Our findings identify how heterogeneous transcriptional dynamics of single cells may contribute to overall tissue behaviour."

The pituitary gland is found in all animals that have a backbone, and it makes and releases many different hormones. For example, one type of pituitary cell expresses the gene that encodes a hormone called prolactin. This hormone has a range of roles, including stimulating milk production and regulating fertility in mammals. The coordinated production of prolactin by pituitary cells is important for reproduction, but it is not clear how (or whether) individual prolactin-producing cells in the gland communicate to coordinate bursting patterns of expression of the prolactin gene."

The model also showed that cells coordinate when they express the prolactin gene to a greater extent with their near neighbours than with cells that are further away in the tissue. Featherstone et al. found that this coordination depends on structures (called gap junctions) that connect the cells and allow signalling between them, and this tissue organisation is established during early development."

In a complex three-dimensional\u00a0(3D) tissue, dynamic and heterogeneous single cell behaviour gives rise to the overall tissue-level gene expression state and determines the ability of the tissue to respond appropriately to acute and chronic stimuli. Transcriptional bursting, defined by periods of RNA synthesis followed by usually longer silent periods, occurs at many genes with characteristic gene-specific timing (<a href=\"#bib52\">Suter et al., 2011</a>). These dynamics have been proposed to be influenced by intrinsic factors that appear stochastic and extrinsic factors that reflect the state of the cell. Thus far, the key to identifying these processes has been single cell analysis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Spiller et al., 2010</a>). In situ hybridisation techniques have revealed non-equivalent activity at gene alleles within individual cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wijgerde et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Raj et al., 2006</a>), but only provide snap-shot measurements of activity. The analysis of gene expression in single living cells using real-time direct RNA imaging systems confirms these pulsatile kinetics (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chubb et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Larson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Martin et al., 2013</a>). However, direct RNA analysis is technically challenging and relatively low throughput, even over short time periods. An alternative is the use of reporter gene analysis. Whilst being indirect, this can be combined with mathematical modelling (<a href=\"#bib52\">Suter et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Harper et al., 2011</a>) to give a quantitative description of the dynamics of single cell gene expression."

The gland is composed of multiple cell lineages that are regulated by external signalling inputs from the hypothalamus and circulation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Featherstone et al., 2012</a>), as well as through complex paracrine signalling within the gland (<a href=\"#bib11\">Denef, 2008</a>). The spatial positioning of cells is organised with cell networks facilitating the propagation of signals across the gland (<a href=\"#bib29\">Le Tissier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mollard et al., 2012</a>). The distinct cell types of the pituitary secrete specific hormones in an organised manner in response to developmental and environmental cues, which has proved to be a useful model system for investigating pituitary-tissue-specific and regulated gene transcription dynamics (<a href=\"#bib14\">Featherstone et al., 2012</a>). Prolactin (PRL) is an important pituitary-derived hormone with multiple functions that is secreted from pituitary lactotrophic cells and controlled in a complex way in response to both acute and long-term signals (<a href=\"#bib14\">Featherstone et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ben-Jonathan et al., 2008</a>). The human PRL (hPRL) gene displays bursting activity in cell lines and primary cells, with variable periods of active and inactive transcriptional states, including a refractory period in the inactive state (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harper et al., 2011</a>). For hPRL, the dynamics observed in dispersed cells are compatible with a binary mathematical model in which there is an 'off' and an 'on' state together with a preparatory or 'primed' state. The transcription machinery transitions between these states as off \u2013 primed \u2013 on \u2013 off, with the time in each state exponentially distributed (<a href=\"#bib52\">Suter et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Harper et al., 2011</a>). We call this the telegraph process with priming."

Here, we employ a new mathematical and statistical model to estimate not only the timing but also different levels of transcriptional activity. This provides a quantitative framework by which to explore temporal and spatial PRL gene expression in single cells within the anterior pituitary gland. We show that shorter durations of activity occur at high transcription rates in immature pituitary glands compared to the adult pituitary; however, we were unable to detect differences in the distribution of transcription rates in different pituitary states. These results suggest that dynamics of gene activity may have a common mechanistic basis in tissues and single cells at all stages of development, which are directly regulated by the developmental state of the tissue. Moreover, these dynamics demonstrate that transcription does not occur as a simple binary 'on-off' process with a single transcription rate in the 'on' state."

Transcription activity was coordinated between closely localised cells within the adult gland, but in developing pituitaries this transcriptional coordination was not evident, potentially due to an immature network of cellular communication. Perturbation of cell communication in the adult gland through trypsin-mediated digestion of extracellular proteins or pharmacological inhibition of intercellular gap junctions reduced transcriptional coordination between cells. These studies provide insight into how transcription dynamics throughout development and adult life relate to the state and structure of a complex and physiologically important tissue."

Imaging analyses were initially performed on adult male pituitary slices (300\u00a0\u00b5m coronal sections) (as depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) for up to 48\u00a0hr in basal culture medium, with fluorescence measured from all actively transcribing cells within a field of approximately 100 cells. Tissue slices were subsequently stimulated with forskolin (5\u00a0\u00b5M), inducing at least a twofold increase in signal, showing that tissue slices remain viable in culture for long periods (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Cells showed differing profiles of fluorescence activity during the imaging period (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Generally cells increased hPRL-d2EGFP reporter gene expression, with the mean fluorescence activity reaching maximal levels at approximately 24\u00a0hr, potentially due to the removal of the pituitary from the inhibitory effects of hypothalamic dopamine (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harper et al., 2010</a>). Autocorrelation analyses did not identify a regular homogeneous period, and fluorescence activity showed a clear deviation from a white noise process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Further quantitative analysis using a stochastic switch model (described in [<a href=\"#bib20\">Hey et al., 2015</a>]) uncovered a clear statistical structure indicating a pulsatile transcriptional behaviour compatible with a pulsed telegraph process. The mathematical analysis of this is addressed in the modelling studies described below. Overall, we found that PRL transcription is dynamic within individual cells, with heterogeneous activity across the cell population."

The original transcription rate of the reporter gene is determined by considering the contribution of mRNA translation rates and mRNA and protein degradation rates to the observed fluorescent protein activity. Binary modelling of PRL transcription dynamics using this approach identified important parameters of gene activity, including a refractory period in the 'off' state (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harper et al., 2011</a>). We have extended this approach through the development of a stochastic switch model (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hey et al., 2015</a>), which enables the inference of different levels of transcription rate as well as the timing of switches between different levels of activity. The model uses a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (<a href=\"#bib17\">Green, 1995</a>) algorithm to produce a probability distribution over all possible transcriptional profiles for each cell. Post-processing of this distribution enables the extraction of a number of candidate transcriptional profiles, each with an associated probability of occurrence (as depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consequently, the transcriptional analysis for each cell is a weighted analysis of all possible transcriptional profiles taking into account the probability of occurrence of each profile (further details of the processing of the data and algorithm output are given in 'Materials and methods'). The fit of the model was tested through calculation of recursive residuals as a way of comparing the prediction from the model and the observed data (for more information see Appendix G of [<a href=\"#bib20\">Hey et al., 2015</a>]). These showed no departure from the model assumptions, indicating that the stochastic switch model fitted the data well."

We characterised the organisation of lactotroph cells in pituitary tissue and found it to be indistinguishable from a random distribution (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This does not preclude the presence of direct communication, or of an organised interaction network, between the cells (as previously described [<a href=\"#bib21\">Hodson et al., 2012</a>]). We assessed the level of correlation between the fluorescence profiles of individual cells. The increase in PRL gene transcription observed in adult pituitary tissue enabled us to investigate whether cells would coordinate their activity in response to a release from the dopaminergic inhibition that would have occurred in\u00a0vivo. Similar activity would be expected in\u00a0vivo when changes in dopaminergic tone facilitate PRL expression and secretion, such as during circadian regulation and lactation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ben-Jonathan and Hnasko, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Romano et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Le Tissier et al., 2015</a>). For any two cells, we calculated the correlation between their fluorescence activity over the time-series as described in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. Correlation was calculated as a function of the distance between individual cells, and showed that cells within approximately 35\u00a0\u00b5m (estimates from all datasets were 25\u201335\u00a0\u00b5m) of each other were more correlated than cells located further apart. The level of correlation over short distances was also significantly greater than the correlation profile obtained when fluorescence profiles were randomised between the cells, but the positioning information was maintained (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This pattern of spatial correlation was not an artefact caused by limitations in image resolution or signal saturation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Spatial correlation of transcription was maintained when the number of cell pairs in each bin was normalised, indicating that this was not an artefact caused by small numbers of cells in the analysis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Spatial correlation also persisted throughout the time-course, indicating that coordination of PRL transcription was an ongoing process and not just a transient phenomenon facilitated by cellular stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

This is probably due to less averaging of signal intensity due to the smaller number of pixels. ii) The pattern of correlation over distance was maintained for both sizes of ROIs (100% ROI in black and 25% ROI in red) showing that imaging resolution was not a factor in causing increased correlation between proximally located cells.

We tested the hypothesis that the lower lactotroph cell density in developing pituitary tissue would provide less opportunity for cell junction signalling and thereby result in less transcriptional coordination between cells. We characterised the potential for cell junction signalling in E18.5 and P1.5 pituitaries by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) and electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013K</a>). Clustering of lactotroph cells increased in P1.5 pituitaries compared to E18.5 pituitaries (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D and G</a>). In the P1.5 pituitary gland lactotroph cells preferentially made contacts with other lactotroph cells, whereas in the E18.5 pituitary gland lactotroph cells were mainly isolated from each other (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,G</a>). We specifically determined the presence of gap junctions and adherens junctions between lactotroph cells, as these have been implicated in the organisation and function of cell networks in the adult pituitary gland (<a href=\"#bib37\">Morand et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chauvet et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kikuchi et al., 2006</a>). In E18.5 pituitaries, only a small number of adherens junctions could be detected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) and the expression levels of the adherens junction proteins (E-, N-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin) were very low. E-, N-cadherin, and \u03b2-catenin were more abundantly expressed in P1.5 pituitaries than in E18.5 pituitaries (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), which coincided with increased numbers of adherens junctions as well as gap junctions and tight junctions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,H</a>). In addition to the presence of visually normal junctions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I,J</a>), we also detected abnormal junctions where cadherin expression at the membrane could be detected but the characteristic thickening of the membrane was absent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>). These data indicate that, although the potential for communication between lactotroph cells increases during development, cell junction communication in P1.5 pituitaries may still be immature or atypical of the communication that occurs in the adult gland."

The transcriptional switch data (using data from cells as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> iii) were visualised for all cells in each tissue sample (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Inspection of these data suggested that periods of active transcription tend to be of longer duration in adult compared to immature tissue. Direct analyses found no evidence for changes in the distribution of transcription rates at different stages of development (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), even when transcription rates were grouped into low and active states (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). However, the number of switches between different rates of activity appeared to be lower in cells in P1.5 pituitary tissue compared to in adult and E18.5 tissues (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). We also found that pulses of transcription in the highest quartile of transcription rates in E18.5 tissues were clearly of shorter duration than those in the bottom 75%, and in comparison to durations of activity in P1.5 and adult tissue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This was also apparent when transcription rates were divided into low and active states and indicates that transcription occurs in a more pulsatile manner in embryonic pituitaries than in more mature tissues (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Where there was more than one switch (and thus the full duration of an interswitch transcriptional state could be determined), the time to the next switch was shorter in immature tissue compared to adult tissue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). These data indicate that transcription dynamics are more stable in the adult tissue. No evidence was obtained for spatial coordination of transcription rates in developing pituitaries (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

The duration represents the minimum duration spent in each transcriptional state, as not all transcriptional states were completely observed within the time-frame of the imaging experiment. Both E18.5 datasets showed a significant difference in the duration spent in low transcriptional states (lower 3 quartiles) to high transcriptional states (upper quartile) as did one P1.5 dataset and two Adult datasets. Moreover, the duration spent in the upper quartile of the E18.5 (pooled data) was significantly different to the duration spent in the upper quartile of either the pooled data of P1.5 or Adult. Significance was assessed through the distribution of the p-values calculated from a Mann-Whitney bootstrap (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Direct RNA counting techniques (MS2, or RNA-FISH) and the imaging of indirect fluorescence and luminescence reporter gene expression has shown that mammalian gene expression is often pulsatile (or 'bursty') with different genes showing varying characteristics of activity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sanchez and Golding, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coulon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Suter et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Spiller et al., 2010</a>). These studies, performed in single cell systems, raise the question as to how apparently uncoordinated and heterogeneous dynamics enable integrated tissue-level responses to physiological stimuli. We have assessed PRL transcription dynamics within pituitary tissue, utilising newly derived mathematical models to define transcription activity. Cells displayed a continuous distribution of transcription rates with heterogeneous patterns of activity across the cell population. Embryonic pituitary glands displayed shorter durations of high transcription rates compared to adult pituitary tissue, which could reflect epigenetic changes during tissue development. We also characterised the spatial organisation of PRL gene expression within lactotroph cells of the pituitary gland and found evidence for the local coordination of transcription dynamics that is potentially mediated by intercellular signalling providing insights into how transcriptional timing is organised in tissue systems."

Poissonian distributions of mRNA production, where mRNAs are produced in random, uncorrelated events, have been described (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zenklusen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">So et al., 2011</a>). However, the prevailing model for mammalian transcription dynamics is the Random Telegraph Model, which describes 'bursty' gene expression, where the gene exists in two states, either 'on' or 'off', with transcripts produced at a defined rate in the 'on' period (<a href=\"#bib27\">Larson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Peccoud and Ycart, 1995</a>). Using binary modelling, we and others have shown that there is a refractory period in the 'off' state, but not in the 'on' state, indicating that there are significant differences between the kinetics of gene activation and inactivation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Suter et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Harper et al., 2011</a>). Binary modelling of transcription dynamics is likely to represent an oversimplification of the true transcription process. Therefore, we developed a stochastic switch model, which allowed us to estimate transcription rates at differing levels and defined the timing of switches between different rates (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hey et al., 2015</a>). This model enabled us to characterise transcription activity in cells maintained in tissue, where individual transcriptional states were sustained for long periods and complete cycles of activity were not often detected. Using the stochastic switch model, we found a continuous distribution of transcription rates, that is differential 'on' states, across the cell population, with heterogeneous timing in transcriptional switches between cells. This heterogeneity in transcriptional activity is likely to result from intrinsic factors previously shown to influence PRL transcription (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harper et al., 2011</a>), together with extrinsic factors, which include the specialisation of lactotroph cells into distinct subtypes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Christian et al., 2007</a>)."

Modelling of transcriptional activity using a random telegraph process has suggested that levels of gene expression can be controlled through digital responses where the burst frequency or duration is altered, but not the transcription rate (<a href=\"#bib28\">Larson et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, digital responses in transcription activity have been detected in single cell systems where the probability that cells are recruited to an expressing population changes under different conditions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chubb et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Walters et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kar et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, different kinetic transcriptional responses including changes to transcription rate and durations of 'on' activity have been found for the connective tissue growth factor (<i>ctgf</i>) gene in response to different stimuli (<a href=\"#bib35\">Molina et al., 2013</a>), and for housekeeping genes in <i>Dictyostelium</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Muramoto et al., 2012</a>). Overall, the total level of transcription in a given pulse will depend not only on the length of the pulse but also on the rate of transcription during the pulse. Different rates of transcription will depend on levels of RNA polymerase II loading, which may be controlled by different chromatin and promoter states. We observed a continuous distribution of transcription rates within cell populations, indicating that different levels of activity are attainable. However, at the population level similar distributions of activity were detected in all developmental states analysed. Thus, differences in transcription rate contribute to heterogeneous activity at the population level and may be important in maintaining tissue function. In different developmental states, we found changes in the duration of high transcription rates between embryonic and more mature pituitary glands, indicative of a more pulsatile activity in immature tissues. Thus, changes to the duration of activity appear more prominent in facilitating changes in the level of gene expression than changes to transcription rate."

However, the role of stochastic gene expression in tissue systems where integrated responses to physiological demand are required is less clear. It has been proposed that heterogeneous responses may facilitate robust tissue-level responses and potentially avoid inappropriate amplification of signals through feedback mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib39\">Paszek et al., 2010</a>). In contrast, mechanisms to reduce expression level heterogeneity have been described in processes such as patterning and specification in other species (<a href=\"#bib31\">Little et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Raj et al., 2010</a>). A recent study used single-molecule RNA-FISH at single points in time to define bursting transcriptional behaviour in fixed liver tissue and identified polyploidy as a mechanism to reduce intrinsic variability between cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bahar Halpern et al., 2015</a>). The pituitary gland is an excellent model system in which to investigate cellular population responses to physiological signals. The gland is composed of multiple cell types that are spatially organised within the pituitary, several of which have been suggested to form interdigitated cellular networks (<a href=\"#bib29\">Le Tissier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mollard et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hodson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fauquier et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bonnefont et al., 2005</a>). Lactotroph cells coordinate their calcium signalling in basal physiological states and more substantially during increased demand such as lactation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hodson et al., 2012</a>). In this study, we have provided a quantitative analysis of lactotroph cell connectivity and shown that PRL transcription is coordinated between lactotroph cells over short distances (25<b>\u2013</b>35\u00a0\u00b5m) and propagated through a network structure. Transcriptional coordination was actively facilitated by intercellular signalling, and we have shown that this could be via juxtacrine signalling including gap junctions. Intercellular signalling has been shown to be important for coordinating other oscillatory systems such as the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2007</a>), the somite segmentation clock (<a href=\"#bib22\">Horikawa et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Masamizu et al., 2006</a>), and electrical coupling of and insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Smolen et al., 1993</a>)."

In contrast there was no coordination at any intercellular distance in earlier developmental states. The limited short distance coordination between lactotroph cells in the adult tissue is not sufficiently strong to lose the key characteristic of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. However, it can be hypothesised that the global system of short range cell-to-cell communication may stabilise longer term changes in the expression level of the tissue, such as those associated with the oestrus cycle or lactation. Thus far the gland as a whole prolactin transcription is essentially random in that for the vast majority of cell pairs, the temporal pattern of their transcription is uncoordinated. Therefore, the law of large numbers guarantees stable long-term results in terms of the global response."

The acute, medium, and long-term outputs of endocrine cells must be regulated across different time scales and to diverse environmental signals, while achieving accurate control of hormone expression. A key question has been whether cells behave similarly to each other or whether they operate in a heterogeneous autonomous fashion. Previous data have suggested the latter in isolated cells and cell lines. Our data now indicate that developing adult tissue structure exerts a coordinating effect on cell behaviour (see <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Our observation that cells display multi-state transcriptional behaviour ('off', 'primed' and 'on' at various levels; outlined in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), as opposed to simple binary 'on'/'off' behaviour, is suggestive of mechanisms that tune the overall output from the gland through the generation of graded responses. Changes in the duration of particular transcription states, as we observed with shorter 'on' periods in immature pituitary glands, also help to refine the overall output from the gland. A simulation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) shows how decreasing the duration of the 'primed' period allows a population of cells to switch to a new stable state of mRNA production. Such modification of activity may facilitate the differentiation of the tissue response without a risk of overshooting behaviour. This offers a new mechanism to explain how tissues integrate different signals with varying durations into appropriate responses. Examples of dynamic control of the pituitary gland include the acute suppression or activation by hypothalamic regulators, circadian response, and long-term behavioural changes through development, puberty, pregnancy, and ageing."

We demonstrate that there is local transcriptional coordination between prolactin-expressing cells in adult, but not in developing pituitary tissue. We have described quantitative analyses of transcription kinetics in different developmental states of the pituitary gland. In all states, we showed that transcription occurs at different levels of activity separated by statistically definable switches. We also detected changes in transcription dynamics between different stages of pituitary development. In the adult tissue, the cells show longer\u00a0lived active states, associated with an altered environment in which there is greater cell-to-cell connectivity. We have identified potential mechanisms by which the combined dynamics of single cells within a tissue may achieve both acute and long-term functional adaptation of the expression of secreted regulatory proteins."

Cell areas analysed were consistent with the size of a typical eukaryotic cell (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Matlab R2014a software (MathWorks, UK) including Bioinformatics and Statistical toolboxes, or the R programming language (<a href=\"http://www.r-project.org\">www.r-project.org</a>) were used for mathematical analyses.

The spatial distribution of cells was tested using a 2D Poission process and Ripley\u2019s K function (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ripley, 1976</a>). Correlation analyses of transcription patterns from fluorescence data were performed in two ways: either using the Euclidean distance between cells or by a network analysis. Correlation based on the Euclidean distance was performed in two parts. In the first part, cell pairs were partitioned into bins according to the distance between the cells starting at 5\u00a0\u00b5m with 5\u00a0\u00b5m intervals. Correlation analysis was performed 99 times for each bin, with n cell pairs sampled with replacement, and with the 5 and 95 percentiles reported. In the second part, n time-series are randomly permuted while the spatial information is unaltered following which correlation coefficients are calculated as described above. A paired t-test was used to identify significant differences between space-time correlations from randomised and non-randomised data. Network correlation analysis was performed similarly to Euclidean distance correlation analyses except that cell pairs were divided into two bins, connected and unconnected, which was defined in a network approach as follows. Cells were assumed to be circular with the same diameter (D). If the distance between two cells was smaller than D, they are considered to be connected. Furthermore cell connectivity is transitive so that if cells a and b are connected and so are cells b and c, then cells a and c are considered to be connected being part of a cell cluster, even if separated by a distance greater than D.

Prl-Luc49 rats were used in immunofluorescence and electron microscopy analyses as multiple copies of the Prl-Luciferase transgene enabled the detection of low expressing PRL cells. Exposed pituitaries were fixed in Bouin\u2019s solution (Sigma, UK) for 24\u00a0hr, washed with water and 70% ethanol and then embedded in wax and 5-\u00b5m sections cut and mounted onto poly-L-lysine slides (Thermo\u00a0Fisher, UK). Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib48\">Semprini et al., 2009</a>) except that slides were pretreated with 3% (v/v) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in methanol for 30\u00a0min following antigen retrieval. Pituitaries were stained with mouse anti-luciferase (<i>P. pyralis</i>) antibody (Life Technologies, UK); co-stained either with: mouse anti- ACTH (Abcam, UK), goat anti-Pit1 (Santa\u00a0Cruz, UK), rabbit anti- PRL (R51, A McNeilly, Edinburgh, UK), mouse anti-E-Cadherin (BD Biosciences, UK), rabbit anti- N-Cadherin (Calbiochem, UK), mouse anti- \u03b2-Catenin (BD Biosciences, UK) and counterstained with DAPI. Briefly, all slides were blocked with blocking buffer (10% (v/v) donkey serum, 5% BSA (w/v) in PBS) and stained with primary antibody in blocking buffer at 4\u00b0C overnight. The primary antibody was detected with anti-mouse-HRP (Vector\u00a0Labs, UK) and Tyramide Signal Amplification- FITC (PerkinElmer, UK). Slides were boiled in sodium citrate (10\u00a0mM pH6) for 2\u00a0min and left to stand in hot buffer for 30\u00a0min before sequentially blocking with biotin, streptavidin (Vector\u00a0Labs, UK) and blocking buffer and application of second primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C, overnight. Detection of the second primary antibodies was with either anti- rabbit biotin, anti- goat biotin, or anti-mouse biotin (Vector\u00a0Labs, UK) and subsequently with streptavidin- alexa546 (Life Technologies, UK). Specificity of antibody labelling was confirmed in negative control sections in which the primary antibody was replaced with the appropriate non-immune serum. Slides were examined and images taken using a Zeiss Excitor confocal microscope with Fluar 20X magnification 0.75 NA objective. For each developmental stage three pituitaries were analysed (two males and one female were analysed from two independent litters) with co-localisation between antibodies counted across at least one whole pituitary slice. No sexual dimorphism was detected."

Expression is measured via a GFP reporter driven by the prolactin promoter in the context of a transgenic BAC. From these fluorescence time traces, the authors reconstruct transcriptional dynamics through a statistical inference model. Single-cell imaging of prolactin promoter activity in cells in culture and the inference model have been published previously by some of the authors. The novelty in this work lies in performing these measurements in a pituitary tissue slice. Although this approach has some caveats (inference of transcription dynamics from protein time-series, transgenic regulation, tissue slices, etc.), my opinion is that it is overall a reasonably faithful approximation of the actual endogenous regulation of this promoter in a tissue context. In that sense, it is a major technical advance. I am unaware of any other studies that look at stochastic gene regulation with this resolution in tissue. The major conclusions they reach are that the prolactin promoter is pulsatile in tissue, the pulsatility changes during development, and that cells show local coordination by means of adherens and gap junctions."

The authors present a series of observations about all three, but I suggest that it would be more biologically insightful to integrate these observations to describe the overall output of prolactin from the tissue. Does overall output increase during developmental stages? If so, does this output result from more cells (i.e. greater density) or changes in the pulsing? If cells are pulsing in synchrony, would the overall output also display pulsatile production from the gland? It is tempting to conclude form the authors' data that cells have some sort of fixed prolactin regulatory circuit, but as the gland matures, more cells result in higher levels of output, and this output becomes dynamically synchronized through cell-cell communication. Is this correct? Or am I misunderstanding the data? Here, the quantitative modeling would be immensely valuable, perhaps allowing one to extrapolate from the tissue slices to the function in vivo."

However, I still find the manuscript lacking in its appeal to a broad audience or even a narrower gene expression readership. It just doesn't go quite far enough in my opinion in generating new insight into the developing pituitary gland. Although I am strongly attracted to the approach the authors have developed, it seems to be an extension of their previous work in this area, published in a series of papers which observe the pulsatility, the change during development, and the refractory period (Harper, JCS, 2010; Featherstone, JCS, 2011; Harper, PLoS Bio, 2011). Here, they have refined their model of the underlying dynamics using a statistical inference method. They conclude that transcription dynamics do not obey a simple telegraph process but do not go beyond this phenomenology, nor do they dissect the functional consequences."

This finding is indeed an interesting one, but does it rise to the level of a self-sufficient story? And could it not be delivered in a more compelling way? In summary, I find the work to be technically accomplished, but my overall impression is that they have not spelled out clearly the significant advance in our biological understanding."

In contrast, our approach tracks transcription dynamics in single cells in real time over 40h periods.

The key novelty of the current work is the analysis of transcriptional bursting kinetics in relation to spatial proximity of cells within intact living tissue. This uses major advances in the statistical analysis of multi-state transcription, based on development and application of the theoretical tools described in our Biostatistics paper (Hey et al. 2015)."

These residuals were calculated on both the P1.5 and Adult tissue that were presented in the Biostatistics paper and we are including them for your consideration. These residuals are a way of comparing the prediction from the model (based on the estimates) and the observed data.

The fluorescence signal depends on multiple processes including transcription, translation, and protein and mRNA degradation. In order to probe the correlation between cells, it is critical to be able to accurately measure, and statistically assess, multi-state switches in transcription rate in isolation from other processes. Back-calculation of transcription rate, as we have undertaken, allows us to estimate the correlation between cells in terms of the transcriptional process by assessing correlation in the switch times and switch directions. The modelling approach also revealed the presence of shorter \u201con\u201d durations in immature pituitary tissue and that similar distributions of transcription rate were present in all stages of pituitary development. These insights are important for understanding how changes in individual cell responses lead to changes to the overall output from a tissue system. The importance of modelling transcriptional dynamics and the insights gained from such analyses, including the modelling approach undertaken in our study were discussed in paragraph two, Discussion. In terms of informing conclusions regarding the overall biological behaviour we have added some further text to the Discussion in paragraph six and now include a new simulation model and hypothesis regarding the nature of overall transcriptional output from an endocrine tissue (outlined in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

We have addressed this by re-plotting the data using bins chosen so that they all have the same number of cell pairs in them.

The authors present a series of observations about all three, but I suggest that it would be more biologically insightful to integrate these observations to describe the overall output of prolactin from the tissue. Does overall output increase during developmental stages? If so, does this output result from more cells (i.e. greater density) or changes in the pulsing? If cells are pulsing in synchrony, would the overall output also display pulsatile production from the gland? It is tempting to conclude form the authors' data that cells have some sort of fixed prolactin regulatory circuit, but as the gland matures, more cells result in higher levels of output, and this output becomes dynamically synchronized through cell-cell communication. Is this correct? Or am I misunderstanding the data? Here, the quantitative modeling would be immensely valuable, perhaps allowing one to extrapolate from the tissue slices to the function in vivo.</i>"

Although I am strongly attracted to the approach the authors have developed, it seems to be an extension of their previous work in this area, published in a series of papers which observe the pulsatility, the change during development, and the refractory period (Harper, JCS, 2010; Featherstone, JCS, 2011; Harper, PLoS Bio, 2011). Here, they have refined their model of the underlying dynamics using a statistical inference method. They conclude that transcription dynamics do not obey a simple telegraph process but do not go beyond this phenomenology, nor do they dissect the functional consequences.</i>"
