Yamaguchi et al. now show that the adenosine comes from the apoptotic cells themselves, with the phagocytes having only a secondary role in its production. The first step involves enzymes called caspases\u2014which have a central role in apoptosis\u2014cleaving a membrane channel protein called pannexin-1 in the dying cells, and thereby activating it. This results in the release of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) from the dying cells. A 5\u2032-nucleotidase expressed by the phagocytes then removes a phosphate group from the AMP to yield adenosine. The adenosine then binds to the A2a receptor on the phagocytes to trigger an anti-inflammatory gene response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Another example is an iron-binding glycoprotein called lactoferrin that inhibits the translocation of certain white blood cells, thereby apparently contributing to the anti-inflammatory effect of apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bournazou et al., 2009</a>)."

And how does the contribution of these molecules to the anti-inflammatory consequences of apoptosis compare with the contribution that results from direct contact between the dying cell and the cell engulfing it? Nagata and co-workers report that in a mouse model of inflammation (zymosan-induced peritonitis), deletion of either the <i>Pannexin-1</i> gene or the <i>A2a</i> gene prolongs the inflammation. These findings support the notion that (in this experimental model) adenosine derived from apoptotic cells contributes significantly to the restriction of inflammation. More precise cell-type-specific targeting of these molecules (and other molecules that have anti-inflammatory effects) should lead to an improved understanding of their relative contributions to immune regulation in specific pathological situations."
