We found that most populations of dopamine neurons receive a similar set of inputs rather than forming strong reciprocal connections with their target areas. A common feature among most populations of dopamine neurons was the existence of dense \u2018clusters\u2019 of inputs within the ventral striatum. However, we found that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum were outliers, receiving relatively few inputs from the ventral striatum and instead receiving more inputs from the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and zona incerta. These results lay a foundation for understanding the input/output structure of the midbrain dopamine circuit and demonstrate that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum constitute a unique class of dopamine neurons regulated by different inputs."

We found that most populations of dopamine neurons receive a similar set of inputs rather than forming strong reciprocal connections with their target areas. A common feature among most populations of dopamine neurons was the existence of dense \u2018clusters\u2019 of inputs within the ventral striatum. However, we found that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum were outliers, receiving relatively few inputs from the ventral striatum and instead receiving more inputs from the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and zona incerta. These results lay a foundation for understanding the input/output structure of the midbrain dopamine circuit and demonstrate that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum constitute a unique class of dopamine neurons regulated by different inputs."

These inputs are likely to shape the activity of each type (that is, their \u2018message\u2019 to the rest of the brain). The mapping revealed that most dopamine neurons do not receive substantial input from the area to which they project (i.e., they do not form \u2018closed loops\u2019). Instead, most of their input comes from a common set of brain regions, including a particularly large number of inputs from the ventral striatum."

Electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus can help to relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the results presented by Menegas et al. suggest that this population of dopamine neurons might be particularly relevant to Parkinson's disease and that focusing future studies on them could ultimately be beneficial for patients."

Recording experiments have shown that many dopamine neurons signal reward prediction error (RPE): the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward value (<a href=\"#bib88\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Clark et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Schultz, 2015</a>).

In the mouse brain, just \u223c30,000 dopamine neurons reside in these nuclei (<a href=\"#bib106\">Zaborszky and Vadasz, 2001</a>). As with other monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain such as serotonin and noradrenaline, this small population of midbrain dopamine neurons exerts its influence over much of the brain as a neuromodulator. However, compared to the other monoamine neuromodulators, the dopamine system is anatomically unique in that the collateralization of dopamine neurons is limited (<a href=\"#bib69\">Moore and Bloom, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Swanson, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Sobel and Corbett, 1984</a>).

For instance, a population of dopamine neurons in the posterior medial VTA that projects to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice, is unique with respect to many features: low expression of dopamine transporter (DAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and the D2 dopamine receptor, narrow spike waveform, high baseline firing and low level of cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib57\">Lammel et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">2014</a>).

A recent study using a cell-type specific transsynaptic tracing method employing a rabies virus confirmed that many of these areas actually project directly onto dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib100\">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</a>). This study also showed that VTA dopamine neurons received a distinct set of inputs compared to SNc dopamine neurons. It is possible that the differences observed in this study between inputs to VTA and SNc dopamine neurons were attributable to the uneven distribution of populations of dopamine neurons with different projection targets between these two nuclei. Both VTA and SNc contain dopamine neurons projecting to different targets, and each population of dopamine neurons projecting to a given target is distributed in a complex manner, often encompassing both VTA and SNc. Thus, it remains to be determined whether dopamine neurons projecting to different targets receive different or similar inputs."

To collect and analyze this large data set, we developed a data acquisition and analysis pipeline using a brain clearing method (CLARITY) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</a>), whole-brain imaging using light-sheet microscopy (<a href=\"#bib48\">Keller et al., 2010</a>), and semi-automated software for analysis. We found that populations of dopamine neurons projecting to most of these targets receive a similar set of inputs, while dopamine neurons projecting to TS (\u2018tail of the striatum\u2019 or \u2018posterior striatum\u2019) are a clear outlier. These results indicate that classifying dopamine neurons based on their projection target is a viable approach, and lay a foundation for studying the mechanisms by which dopamine neurons are regulated. Our approach is based on an automated imaging and analysis suite that will facilitate similar anatomical studies in other brain systems in an efficient and quantitative manner."

This rabies virus is pseudotyped with an avian sarcoma and leukemia virus (ALSV-A) envelope protein (EnvA), so that the initial infection is restricted to cells that express a cognate receptor (TVA) in mammalian brains. In addition, this rabies virus lacks the gene encoding the rabies virus envelope glycoprotein (RG), which is required for trans-synaptic spread. This allows us to restrict trans-synaptic spread to cells that exogenously express RG. In this way, only monosynaptic (but not poly-synaptic) inputs are trans-synaptically labeled. In our previous work, we used two helper viruses to express TVA and RG under the control of Cre recombinase (AAV5-FLEX-TVA-mCherry and AAV8-FLEX-RG) (<a href=\"#bib100\">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</a>). We previously injected these helper viruses into the VTA or SNc of transgenic mice expressing Cre specifically in dopamine neurons (dopamine transporter-Cre, or DAT-Cre) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Backman et al., 2006</a>) to specifically label the monosynaptic inputs of these dopamine neurons throughout the brain (<a href=\"#bib100\">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</a>)."

To do this, we injected a helper virus that expresses TVA under the control of Cre recombinase (AAV5-FLEX-TVA) into a dopamine projection site and co-injected a virus bearing blue fluorescent protein (AAV1-CA-BFP) to mark this site. Because it has been shown that minute TVA expression is sufficient for infection by ALSV-A (<a href=\"#bib6\">Belanger et al., 1995</a>), we reasoned that DAT-Cre-expressing dopamine neurons in the midbrain which were retrogradely infected by AAV5-FLEX-TVA would express enough TVA for initial rabies infection in a Cre-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To verify this, we injected AAV5-FLEX-TVA into one of the projection sites, the DS. After 3 weeks, rabies virus was injected into both VTA and SNc. In this experiment, we did not inject AAV8-FLEX-RG, so the rabies virus did not spread trans-synaptically. We did this to visualize only neurons that were directly infected by rabies virus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Consistent with our intention, we observed that many VTA/SNc neurons were infected by the rabies virus and therefore expressed GFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Based on antibody staining, almost all of the GFP-positive neurons were also positive for TH (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013F</a>), a marker for dopamine neurons (98 \u00b1 1%; <i>n</i> = 600 neurons, <i>n</i> = 3 mice). Given that injecting pseudotyped rabies virus alone resulted in very few infections (<a href=\"#bib100\">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</a>), these results indicate that the injection of AAV5-FLEX-TVA into a dopamine projection site allowed us to restrict infection of rabies virus to dopamine neurons in a projection specific manner."

Therefore, we only needed to image with sufficient resolution to distinguish every cell body throughout the brain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This resulted in \u223c2 Tb of image data from each brain, allowing us to image many brains, whereas imaging with even 2\u00d7 higher magnification in each dimension would have led to prohibitively (based on our present processing capacity) large file sizes of \u223c20 Tb per brain. We applied multiple segmentation algorithms to this data to classify each pixel as \u2018cell\u2019 or \u2018non-cell\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Quality of segmentation was consistent across many regions and imaging depths, including cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), striatum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), midbrain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), and cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Because each cell was present in several images (at different depths), we then collapsed all neighboring \u2018cell\u2019 pixels in all three dimensions to generate a list of the centroids of the detected cells. To compare the distribution of cells across brains, we aligned the autofluorescence image captured from each brain to a common \u2018reference space\u2019 and used these transformations to align each set of centroids into this common space (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). By aligning brains with different genetically defined populations of neurons labeled, we were able to determine the boundaries of major brain regions in this reference space in three dimensions. This strategy for analysis mirrors the analysis pipeline called \u2018CUBIC\u2019, proposed for comparable analyses of whole-brain images acquired using a similar clearing method (<a href=\"#bib92\">Susaki et al., 2014</a>)."

In the case of Amy-projecting dopamine neurons, we observed labeling throughout VTA/SNc and also substantial labeling in supramammillary areas (A10rv) (<a href=\"#bib105\">Yetnikoff et al., 2014</a>). In short, each brain area receives projections from dopamine neurons in slightly different, but highly overlapping subareas of VTA/SNc. Furthermore, we found that the distribution of labeled neurons in the VTA/SNc was similar in cases with and without transsynaptic spread (with and without RG, respectively), indicating that transsynaptic spread between primarily infected dopamine neurons and other dopamine neurons did not lead to the nonspecific infection of all dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Because the number of labeled neurons is different in each condition (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), comparing different conditions required a method of normalization. We first observed the distributions of labeled neurons by plotting the positions of labeled neurons for each condition. To normalize for the different numbers of total neurons labeled for visualization, we randomly sampled 1500 neurons from each brain, and plotted corresponding neurons in coronal sections (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

We initially hypothesized that each of the eight populations would receive inputs from a subset of the regions identified in these previous studies. Surprisingly, we found that the distribution of inputs to each population appeared to be largely similar (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We found that monosynaptic inputs to most dopamine neurons were concentrated in the ventral striatum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and that several areas containing inputs are continuous around the medial forebrain bundle, along the entire anterior\u2013posterior axis (across the nucleus boundaries) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013E</a>) as was observed previously (<a href=\"#bib37\">Geisler and Zahm, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</a>), regardless of the projection targets. However, we found that TS-projecting dopamine neurons did not show a similar concentration of inputs: these neurons received many fewer inputs from anterior regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) and ventromedial regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). In short, these observations suggested that the overall distribution of inputs to TS-projecting dopamine neurons is different from those of the rest of the dopamine neuron populations (whose inputs largely overlapped with one another). We next examined these similarities and differences in more systematic and quantitative manners."

Although we found some differences between subpopulations, the overall patterns were surprisingly similar. Among the brain systems, we found that the basal ganglia and hypothalamus provided the majority of inputs to dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the basal ganglia, the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core and shell), DS and ventral pallidum were the largest sources of inputs. In hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus (LH) (including the parasubthalamic nucleus [PSTh]) contained the largest number of inputs, and the preoptic areas also provided a substantial number.

While the ventral striatum is one of the largest sources of inputs to most of the subpopulations, it is a relatively minor source of inputs to TS-projecting dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Instead, TS-projecting neurons receive an increased proportion of their inputs from the GP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), entopeduncular nucleus (EP, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), PSTh, subthalamic nucleus (STh) and zona incerta (ZI) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). To statistically verify these observations, we first performed a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) among the 20 main input areas (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). After correcting for multiple comparisons, nucleus accumbens shell, GP, STh and ZI remained significant (p = 0.00045, 0.0017, 0.00023, and 0.0028, respectively; significant after Holm-Sidak corrections for multiple comparisons). These differences are mainly attributable to the effect of the TS-projecting dopamine population. If we remove TS in the analysis, none of these areas retain statistical significance with the exception of the ventromedial hypothalamus (p = 0.0028, 1-way ANOVA), which appears to be a slightly larger source of inputs to VS-projecting dopamine neurons. Furthermore, in all of the above cases, the percentage of inputs from TS was significantly larger than the group mean of the remainder of the populations (p &lt; 0.001; t-test). These results suggest that many dopamine neurons are embedded in a \u2018canonical\u2019 circuit similar to VS-projecting dopamine neurons (which are known to encode RPE), while TS-projecting dopamine neurons have a unique distribution of inputs and therefore form a distinct class of dopamine neurons."

For example, DS-projecting dopamine neurons received more inputs from the neocortex than other populations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), while VS-projecting dopamine neurons received more inputs from the olfactory tubercle and other ventromedial structures such as the ventromedial hypothalamus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Furthermore, DS-projecting and OFC-projecting dopamine neurons appeared to receive more inputs from the dorsal-most part of the DS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In the posterior midbrain, all populations received inputs from the dorsal raphe, but lHb-projecting dopamine neurons received fewer inputs from nearby areas (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). In addition, lHb-projecting dopamine neurons received fewer inputs from posterior midbrain regions such as the periaqueductal grey and gigantocellular reticular nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). By far, though, the most distinct outlier was the set of inputs to TS-projecting dopamine neurons. In all of the cases in which our data attained statistical significance across all populations after correction for multiple comparisons (ventral striatum, ventromedial hypothalamus, GP, ZI, and STh), TS-projecting neurons were the clear outliers (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We found that most pairs had relatively high correlations (<i>r</i> = 0.85\u20130.98). Here again, TS-projecting dopamine neurons had consistently lower correlations than other populations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>): TS-projecting dopamine neurons were most distinct from VS- and DS-projecting dopamine neurons (<i>r</i> = 0.65 and 0.69, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), although the similarity was slightly higher compared to non-striatal regions (<i>r</i> = 0.69\u20130.82). Hierarchical clustering supported this view: TS-projecting dopamine neurons were an outlier among the populations tested (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Instead, most populations of dopamine neurons receive a surprisingly similar set of inputs. On the other hand, we found a systematic outlier: dopamine neurons projecting to the tail of the striatum receive a distinct set of inputs compared to dopamine neurons projecting to other targets. This conclusion was supported by the following observations. First, when the percent of inputs from a given area was found significantly different among conditions (1-way ANOVA), TS-projecting dopamine neurons were the main driver of these differences. TS-projecting dopamine neurons received far fewer inputs from the nucleus accumbens, whereas TS-projecting neurons received uniquely higher numbers of inputs from the GP, STh, and ZI. Second, our examination of the spatial shift of input neurons in coronal optical sections also indicated that the center of mass of inputs to the TS-projecting population tended to be located more lateral and dorsal while the center of mass of inputs for the VS-projecting population tended towards the opposite. Third, correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering indicated that the pattern of inputs to TS-projecting dopamine neurons was most distinct from other conditions. Together, these results indicate that the dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum form a distinct class of dopamine neurons."

According to this view, each macrosystem (such as the ventral striatum, the DS, or the extended amygdala) would have its own dedicated dopamine system, resulting in a circuit organization resembling many parallel closed loops. This idea is plausible, considering the topographical organization of the dopaminergic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib93\">Swanson, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Yetnikoff et al., 2014</a>), and it could explain the diverse function of dopamine neurons. If dopamine neurons encode RPE, each macrosystem could learn independently through its own feedback. To test this directly, we asked whether dopamine neurons projecting to a nucleus in one macrosystem receive a larger proportion of their inputs from that nucleus or from other nuclei in that same macrosystem."

If RPE is used to correct a neuron's behavior so that the neuron could represent predicted value more accurately in the future, a logical structure could be for prediction (expectation) to be sent to dopamine neurons and then for the same dopamine neurons to send back the error of the prediction (RPE) to the same neuron or the same system. Although many areas that receive dopamine projections also send projections to dopamine neurons, we found that reciprocal connections are not a basic principle explaining the distribution of monosynaptic inputs. In other words, reciprocal connectivity might not be the general mechanism of RPE computation and dopamine functions. Our data suggests that neurons in cortex, striatum, pallidum, habenula, or amygdala may not \u2018entrain\u2019 different populations of dopamine neurons. Rather, most dopamine neurons are more likely to gather information from a set of common sources and broadcast a common RPE to many brain areas (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), while specific populations with different sets of inputs, such as TS-projecting dopamine neurons, might have different functions."

Although we were able to rule out some of the areas mentioned above which preferentially project to TS-projecting dopamine neurons, many brain areas still remain on the list of prominent inputs to VS-projecting dopamine neurons.

Considering that dopamine plays essential roles in striatal functions, this result provides insight into the functioning of different parts of the striatum. Most commonly, the striatum is divided into two parts along the dorso\u2013ventral axis: ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens in rodents, also called the \u2018limbic\u2019 striatum) and DS. In addition, the striatum is divided into more sub-regions by splitting the ventral striatum into \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018shell\u2019 regions and splitting the DS into dorso-medial (associative) and dorso-lateral (motor-related) regions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Francois et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Lynd-Balta and Haber, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Haber et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Joel and Weiner, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Redgrave et al., 2010</a>). In primates, projections from different cortical areas define different striatal regions. Projections from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pre-supplementary motor cortex preferentially target associative striatum, whereas projections from OFC are unique to the limbic striatum. In rodents, there is a substantial controversy over the existence and location of homologous structures to the DLPFC or OFC of the monkey (<a href=\"#bib79\">Preuss, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Uylings et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Vertes, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kita et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it is difficult to define the subareas of the striatum in the mouse brain. Nonetheless, even if it is not perfectly homologous to the primate striatum, previous studies suggest that the rodent striatum could contain a functional gradient from ventromedial to dorsolateral in agreement with the organization of cortical projections (<a href=\"#bib8\">Berendse et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Voorn et al., 2004</a>)."

Supporting the notion that these populations form a functional gradient, the input patterns to TS-projecting dopamine neurons are slightly more similar to that of DS-projecting dopamine than VS-projecting dopamine (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). However, we found that the similarity of inputs between DS- and VS- projecting dopamine neurons was much higher than similarity of inputs between DS- and TS- projecting dopamine neurons. This could potentially be explained by the fact that our injections into DS and VS were much closer together along the A-P axis (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

Our results raise the possibility that dopamine neurons projecting to the tail of the striatum convey a different type of information than RPE. One interesting possibility is that dopamine signals in the tail of the striatum lack mechanisms to update the value representation based on the consequences of actions, consistent with the idea that the dopamine recipient neurons residing in this part of the striatum store \u2018stable values\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kim and Hikosaka, 2013</a>). Dopamine is involved in different aspects of reward-based learning (e.g., goal-directed vs habit) as well as a wider range of functions besides reward-based learning, including motor and cognitive functions.

For instance, it has often been assumed that the striatum sends inhibitory \u2018expectation\u2019 signals to dopamine neurons that can \u2018cancel out\u2019 reward values when they are expected (<a href=\"#bib42\">Houk and Adams, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Kobayashi and Okada, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Doya, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Rao, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Khamassi and Humphries, 2012</a>).

STh receives a strong projection from the GP in addition to the cortex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Canteras et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Francois et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kita et al., 2014</a>) and sends projections to other basal ganglia nuclei, such as striatum, GP, EP and SNr (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kita and Kitai, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Degos et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, TS-projecting dopamine neurons receive inputs from STh as well as from areas that tend to be heavily interconnected with STh, such as GP, EP and SNr. These results suggest that, instead of inhibitory inputs from the ventral striatum (\u2018direct pathway\u2019), TS-projecting dopamine neurons receive more glutamatergic inputs from the STh (\u2018hyperdirect pathway\u2019), inhibitory inputs from pallidum (\u2018indirect pathway\u2019), and also inputs from two output nuclei: SNr and EP (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Thus, cortical information may be transmitted to TS-projecting dopamine neurons through different pathways than other dopamine neurons. Finally, ZI, which is related to arousal, and PSTh, which is related to autonomic function, (<a href=\"#bib38\">Goto and Swanson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kita et al., 2014</a>), are additional unique pathways from cortex to TS-projecting dopamine neurons."

However, to our knowledge, there is no clear structure or function corresponding to the ventral patches that we described. In a previous study, we found that calbindin, a marker for patches in the DS, partially distinguished the ventral patches from surrounding areas (<a href=\"#bib100\">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</a>). These patches are, in essence, dense \u2018hot spots\u2019 for inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons whereas neurons outside the patches are predominantly indirectly (if at all) connected to dopamine neurons. One interesting possibility is that these ventral patches are negatively or positively correlated with the observation of \u2018hedonic hot spots\u2019 within the striatum. These hot spots are so named because the \u2018hedonic\u2019 desire for food was enhanced by the local stimulation of \u03bc-opioid receptors residing in the medial-dorsal part of the anterior ventral striatum but not by the stimulation of neighboring areas (<a href=\"#bib13\">Castro and Berridge, 2014</a>). Overall, the type of information each part of the striatum relays to dopamine neurons is an open question. Our anatomical definition of the stereotypical locations of the ventral patches will help guide future studies of what information is channeled through these microdomains (ventral patches) of the ventral striatum."

Currently, the main targets for DBS are STh, ZI, GPi (also called EP in rodents) and PPTg. Interestingly, our results showed that TS-projecting dopamine neurons receive monosynaptic inputs preferentially from all of these areas. In other words, effective DBS sites might reside in presynaptic sites that preferentially target TS-projecting dopamine neurons, rather than common inputs to all the dopamine neurons such as LH. As a result, DBS applied to these areas might influence only the circuits relevant to the TS-projecting dopamine system (most of which is lost in patients) without changing other aspects of dopamine functions, such as learning and reward-seeking behaviors. If this is true, the list of monosynaptic inputs to TS-projecting dopamine neurons will be a useful reference for seeking new DBS targets. Furthermore, expanding the framework for understanding the mechanism of DBS function could help improve its efficiency."

Two studies were published very recently that are highly related to our present work. One study found that monosynaptic inputs to dopamine neurons in VTA that project to medial and lateral NAc, mPFC and Amy were similar in all the areas they examined, with the exception of inputs from the dorsal raphe and within NAc (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beier et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, another study found that monosynaptic inputs to neurons in SNc that project to medial DS and lateral DS were similar with the exception of inputs within DS (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lerner et al., 2015</a>). Although neither of these studies examined TS-projecting dopamine neurons, the results are largely consistent with our finding that monosynaptic input patterns to most dopamine subpopulation are similar, and strengthen our finding that TS-projecting dopamine neurons are relatively unique. However, the patterns of inputs for VS-projecting neurons shown in the former study (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beier et al., 2015</a>) and those for DS-projecting dopamine neurons in the latter study (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lerner et al., 2015</a>) were quite different, in contrast to our finding. We previously observed different patterns of input between VTA and SNc dopamine neurons such as a strong preferential projection from DS to SNc (<a href=\"#bib100\">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</a>). In the present study, we found that most populations of projection-specific dopamine neurons are distributed both in VTA and SNc. We, therefore, injected rabies virus both in VTA and SNc for all eight conditions. The large difference in inputs between VS-projecting VTA neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beier et al., 2015</a>) and DS-projecting SNc populations (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lerner et al., 2015</a>) may not be due to the difference in projection targets (VS vs DS), but rather because of the location of their virus injection sites (VTA vs SNc). It remains to be examined whether VTA dopamine neurons with a specific projection site receive a different set of monosynaptic inputs compared to SNc dopamine neurons that project to the same site (i.e., VTA \u2192 DS neurons vs SNc \u2192 DS neurons)."

However, there is some disagreement about the extent of collateralization of dopamine axons (<a href=\"#bib105\">Yetnikoff et al., 2014</a>); some dopamine neurons may project to multiple brain areas (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fallon and Loughlin, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Loughlin and Fallon, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Takada and Hattori, 1986</a>). Using CLARITY and whole brain imaging with membrane-bound GFP, Lerner et al. found that DS-projecting SNc neurons have negligible collateralization to NAc and no collateralization to other dopamine target areas such as prefrontal cortex or amygdala (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lerner et al., 2015</a>). On the other hand, using conventional light microscope, Beier et al. found that lateral NAc-projecting dopamine neurons have broad arborizations going to DS, whereas medial NAc-projecting dopamine neurons do not project to the DS (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beier et al., 2015</a>). They found that neither dopamine groups collateralize to mPFC or amygdala (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beier et al., 2015</a>). In spite of some discrepancies between studies, these studies show that dopamine neurons projecting to the target areas which we chose in the present study consist of largely non-overlapping subpopulations. However, because these studies could have overlooked sparse axon signals, we must interpret the results carefully, because any populations of dopamine neurons infected due to their projections to multiple areas would make the data appear more similar."

Serial sectioning 2-photon microscopy has the advantage of using an opaque brain as starting material, meaning that it doesn't require any clearing steps. Light-sheet imaging of cleared tissues, by contrast, allows for much more rapid image acquisition since there is no time spent physically sectioning the tissue and also because scanning is done with a sheet rather than a line. This increased scan speed allows for the rapid imaging of whole mouse brains with sufficient resolution to image every neuron. Because we wanted to characterize the distributions of all labeled neurons across brains, we decided to use light sheet microscopy on cleared brains."

Because we wanted to visualize GFP-labeled neurons, we decided to use CLARITY so that some native fluorescence (i.e., GFP and tdTomato) would remain intact, although we found that CLARITY causes a loss of mCherry and BFP fluorescence. Furthermore, exposure to organic solvents dramatically alters the size and overall morphology of the brain, while CLARITY leaves it relatively intact. Therefore, although the autofluorescence is dimmer in CLARITY-cleared brains (compared to iDISCO-cleared brains), brain structures are easier to identify. In summary, we found that the combination of CLARITY and light sheet microscopy allows for the rapid acquisition of whole brain rabies-tracing results."

In this study, we contributed to this effort in three different ways. First, we developed an automated pipeline for whole brain imaging, using a brain-clearing method (CLARITY), light sheet microscopy, and semi-automated data analysis. This will help to lower the hurdle for future systematic anatomy studies, and increase their consistency and efficiency. Second, we defined the full sets of monosynaptic inputs to eight subpopulations of dopamine neurons specified by projection targets. Third, we found that dopamine neurons projecting to the tail of the striatum are unique in their monosynaptic inputs, suggesting that they might also be an outlier functionally compared both to dopamine neurons projecting to other parts of the striatum and to those projecting to other brain regions (i.e., cortex, GP, amygdala). This foundational work also opens the door to further investigations. For example, what are the functional differences between the anterior and posterior (tail) regions of the striatum, and what is the role of dopamine in each? What information is calculated by dopamine neurons that project to different parts of the striatum, and how do the patterns of their inputs account for the differences in their signals? How is each dopamine population related to the symptoms of various disorders such as Parkinson's disease? We hope that our work will help guide these types of studies by providing them with a detailed circuit diagram as a starting point."

This afforded an extra opportunity to reduce noise by only counting \u2018cells\u2019 that were within a reasonable range of diameters (2.5 \u03bcm\u201350 \u03bcm), present in consecutive images, and with a reasonable shape (i.e., circularity of &gt;0.1).

We performed affine alignment followed by B-spline alignment based on mutual information, as previously proposed for human MRI image registration (<a href=\"#bib67\">Metz et al., 2011</a>). The resulting transformation (from individual brain to reference space) was applied to the centroids of detected cells in order to plot all cells in the same reference space."

These findings provide important information for future studies focused on understanding computations and processing of reward signals that occur in different subpopulations of dopamine neurons."

In their past work (<a href=\"#bib100\">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</a>), the authors made a fundamental contribution to the field by using retrograde viral tracing to produce a whole-brain map of synaptic inputs into dopamine neurons. They showed that VTA and SNc dopamine neurons receive an incredibly diverse array of inputs from a wide range of brain nuclei. In the present study, they focus on the much more difficult question of whether the patterns of synaptic innervation vary between subpopulations dopamine neurons categorized according to their targeted regions. To address this question, the authors use advanced viral tracing and brain clearing techniques. They developed a pipeline which included semiautomated acquisition and analysis of data from cleared brains acquired using light-sheet microscopy."

The main finding here is that inputs to dopamine neurons do not arrive preferentially from their targeted regions (reciprocal), but rather most subpopulations receive broad, overlapping inputs. Interestingly, dorsal posterior projecting dopamine neurons seem to be the only outlier receiving a smaller percentage of inputs from ventral striatum, and a high percentage of inputs from subthalamic nucleus, and zona incerta. These findings provide important information for future studies focused on understanding computations and processing of reward signals that occur in dopamine neurons of different subpopulations."
