Now in <i>eLife</i>, Magnus Nordborg and co-workers\u2014from Austria, the US, the UK and Germany\u2014have explored variations in DNA methylation among wild populations of a plant called <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> in Sweden to see how epigenetic variation is influenced by the local environment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Dubin et al., 2015</a>)."

However, the potential effects of this epigenetic variation on fitness and local adaptation remain unclear. Nordborg and co-workers\u2014who include Manu Dubin, Pei Zhang, Dazhe Meng and Marie-Stanislas Remigereau as joint first authors\u2014found that DNA methylation at CHH sites in transposable elements increases with temperature (<a href=\"#bib2\">Dubin et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Using CHH methylation as a trait, Nordborg and co-workers then conducted a genome-wide search and revealed that, in general, a lot of the variation in this trait could be explained by which allele the plant carried at a specific site called <i>CMT2a</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This site is near a gene that encodes an enzyme called CMT2, which is known to methylate CHG and CHH sites in long transposable elements (<a href=\"#bib9\">Zemach et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Stroud et al., 2014</a>). All the plants examined carried one of two possible alleles (that differed by a single DNA base). Furthermore, plants with the less common of the two alleles\u2014called the \u2018non-reference allele\u2019\u2014typically had more CHH methylation than plants with the more common reference allele. Additional searches revealed another similar site nearby, called <i>CMT2b</i>. In this case plants with the rarer non-reference allele had less CHH methylation on average."

Together with other recent results (<a href=\"#bib7\">Shen et al., 2014</a>), these latest findings indicate that the temperature-dependent CHH methylation is a flexible trait, and that certain alleles that encode the CMT2 enzyme may make plant genomes more responsive to environmental changes."

Likewise, comparisons between individuals of different species could unveil other types of naturally occurring diversity and provide a wealth of genetic or genomic resources to help us better understand DNA methylation in the light of evolutionary biology. Furthermore, studies within a species could help determine how much variation in physical traits is controlled by DNA methylation variation as opposed to genetic variation. In this scenario each genome-wide difference in DNA methylation is used as a marker and tested for an association with the trait under study. However, differences in DNA methylation markers between different populations due to demographic factors would confound these studies, making it difficult to determine the underlying epigenetic variation that contributes to the traits."
