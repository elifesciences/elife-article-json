                    "text": "The Hippo signaling pathway regulates tissue growth in <i>Drosophila</i> through the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). How Yki activates target gene transcription is poorly understood. Here, we identify Nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (Ncoa6), a subunit of the Trithorax-related (Trr) histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex, as a Yki-binding protein. Like Yki, Ncoa6 and Trr are functionally required for Hippo-mediated growth control and target gene expression. Strikingly, artificial tethering of Ncoa6 to Sd is sufficient to promote tissue growth and Yki target expression even in the absence of Yki, underscoring the importance of Yki-mediated recruitment of Ncoa6 in transcriptional activation. Consistent with the established role for the Trr complex in histone methylation, we show that Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr are required for normal H3K4 methylation at Hippo target genes. These findings shed light on Yki-mediated transcriptional regulation and uncover a potential link between chromatin modification and tissue growth."

How Yki activates target gene transcription is poorly understood. Here, we identify Nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (Ncoa6), a subunit of the Trithorax-related (Trr) histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex, as a Yki-binding protein. Like Yki, Ncoa6 and Trr are functionally required for Hippo-mediated growth control and target gene expression. Strikingly, artificial tethering of Ncoa6 to Sd is sufficient to promote tissue growth and Yki target expression even in the absence of Yki, underscoring the importance of Yki-mediated recruitment of Ncoa6 in transcriptional activation. Consistent with the established role for the Trr complex in histone methylation, we show that Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr are required for normal H3K4 methylation at Hippo target genes. These findings shed light on Yki-mediated transcriptional regulation and uncover a potential link between chromatin modification and tissue growth."

Furthermore, when the Ncoa6 protein was bound directly to the transcription factor, the tissue grew normally even when the Yorkie protein was not present.

Initially discovered in <i>Drosophila</i> for its critical role in restricting imaginal disc growth, the Hippo pathway comprises several tumor suppressor proteins acting through a core kinase cascade that ultimately phosphorylates and inactivates the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huang et al., 2005</a>). Consistent with its essential role in normal development and tissue homeostasis, YAP, the mammalian counterpart of Yki, encodes a bona fide oncogene and is overexpressed and/or activated in a wide spectrum of human cancers. Elucidating the molecular mechanism by which Yki functions as a transcriptional coactivator is not only relevant for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of growth control but also has important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the Hippo pathway in cancer and regenerative medicine."

A particularly prevalent modification involved in transcriptional activation is histone H3 methylation. <i>Drosophila</i> contains three COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1)-like histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes, each defined by a distinct methyltransferase subunit, namely, Trithorax (Trx), Trithorax-related (Trr), and dSet1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mohan et al., 2011</a>). Previous genetic analysis has implicated Trx in the maintenance of Hox gene transcription and Trr in ecdysone receptor (EcR)-mediated gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib23\">Sedkov et al., 2003</a>). Nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (Ncoa6) is a specific subunit of the Trr complex in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mohan et al., 2011</a>). Although its <i>in vivo</i> function remains undefined in <i>Drosophila</i>, the mammalian Ncoa6 orthologue (also known as NRC, ASC-2, TRBP, PRIP, and RAP250) is essential for embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kuang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Antonson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Zhu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Mahajan et al., 2004</a>). The mammalian Ncoa6 has been shown to potentiate the activity of nuclear hormone receptors and other DNA-binding transcription factors, at least in part, by recruiting the H3K4 methyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mahajan and Samuels, 2008</a>). Interestingly, like YAP, the mammalian Ncoa6 is a pro-survival and anti-apoptotic gene (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mahajan et al., 2004</a>) and is amplified in multiple cancer types such as breast, colon, and lung cancers (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lee et al., 1999</a>)."

We provide evidence showing that the transcriptional coactivator function of Yki depends on its ability to interact with Ncoa6 and that the Trr methyltransferase complex is functionally required for Hippo-mediated growth and gene expression. We further show that Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr are required for normal H3K4 methylation at Hippo target genes. Thus, Yki functions as a transcriptional coactivator, at least in part, by recruiting a H3K4 methyltransferase and altering the chromatin state of target genes."

Briefly, <i>Drosophila</i> S2R+ cells were transfected with Yki- and Sd-expressing vectors, together with HRE-luciferase reporter and Pol III-Renilla expression vector as an internal control. Transfected cells were then seeded into individual dsRNA-containing 96-well plates. After RNAi depletion, HRE-luciferase reporter activity was measured and normalized to the Renilla control. This RNAi screen allowed us to uncover both positive and negative regulators of the HRE-luciferase reporter. We have previously characterized a negative regulator from the screen, Tgi (<a href=\"#bib13\">Koontz et al., 2013</a>). Here, we focus on the positive transcriptional regulators (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement1</a>)."

We were particularly interested in Ncoa6 since it contains three PPxY sequences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which represent a well-established ligand binding motif for WW domains. Since Yki contains two WW domains, we hypothesized that Ncoa6 may potentiate Yki-mediated transcriptional activation through physical interactions with Yki. Indeed, epitope-tagged Ncoa6 and Yki coimmunoprecipitated with each other in <i>Drosophila</i> S2R+ cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This interaction was abolished by mutating the three PPxY motifs in Ncoa6 (Ncoa6<sup>3m</sup>) or the two WW domains in Yki (Yki<sup>WM</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggesting that the Ncoa6\u2013Yki interaction was mediated by Ncoa6's PPxY motifs and Yki's WW domains. In agreement with this conclusion, we found that wild-type Ncoa6, but not Ncoa6<sup>3m</sup>, promoted nuclear accumulation of Yki in S2R+ cells in co-transfection assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Of note, a recently published Hippo pathway protein\u2013protein interactome included Ncoa6 as one of 245 proteins that were co-immunopreciated by Yki (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>)."

Since Sd is the primary DNA-binding transcription partner for Yki (<a href=\"#bib13\">Koontz et al., 2013</a>), we reasoned that fusing the DNA-binding domain of Sd with Ncoa6 may directly target Ncoa6 to Hippo target genes and therefore stimulate their transcription in a Yki-independent manner (i.e., bypassing the genetic requirement for Yki). We tested this hypothesis in <i>Drosophila</i> wing discs using the MARCM technique. As reported before (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huang et al., 2005</a>), <i>yki</i> mutant clones grew poorly and the rarely recovered clones always showed decreased Diap1 levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). MARCM clones expressing a fusion protein between the DNA-binding domain of Sd and Ncoa6 (SdDB-Ncoa6) resulted in rounded clone morphology and dramatically increased Diap1 levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Significantly, the SdDB-Ncoa6 fusion protein, but not wild-type Ncoa6, rescued the growth defect and the decreased Diap1 levels in <i>yki</i> mutant clone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>). In fact, <i>yki</i> mutant clones with SdDB-Ncoa6 overexpression were indistinguishable in clone size and Diap1 expression compared to wild-type clones with SdDB-Ncoa6 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>). Thus, the SdDB\u2013Ncoa6 fusion protein exhibits gain-of-function activity in a Yki-independent manner. Consistent with this notion, the SdDB-Ncoa6 fusion protein robustly stimulated the HRE-luciferase reporter in S2R+ cells in a manner that was not suppressed by co-expression of Wts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), in contrast to Wts' ability to suppress the HRE-luciferase reporter activity stimulated by the co-transfection of Sd, Yki, and Ncoa6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Since Ncoa6 has been reported to be a specific subunit of the Trr methyltransferase complex, we examined whether Trr, the catalytic subunit of this methyltransferase complex, is also required for Hippo-mediated growth control and gene expression. Similar to Ncoa6, expression of UAS-trr RNAi by the <i>dpp</i>-Gal4 driver resulted in a significant decrease in the width of the <i>dpp</i>-expression domain in adult wings and a corresponding decrease in the Hippo target genes <i>diap1</i> and <i>fj</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D,G</a>). Like Ncoa6, Trr knockdown suppressed eye overgrowth induced by Yki overexpression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>) and aggravated the small eye phenotype caused by Sd overexpression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J,L</a>), although it did not visibly suppress eye overgrowth induced by Wts RNAi (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). We also used MARCM to examine the requirement of Trr in <i>hpo</i> mutant clones. Similar to Ncoa6, Trr knockdown suppressed the overgrowth as well as the elevated Diap1 expression in <i>hpo</i> mutant clones (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013F</a>).

To determine if Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr regulate growth in the Hippo pathway by modulating histone H3K4 methylation, we first examined the global levels of histone H3K4 methylation in <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal discs. It was reported previously that RNAi knockdown of Trr (using the <i>en-</i>Gal4 driver) led to a strong decrease in H3K4me1 in the posterior compartment of the wing imaginal discs, while it had marginal effects on H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mohan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Herz et al., 2012</a>). It was also showed that RNAi knockdown of Ncoa6 in the posterior compartment of the wing imaginal disc resulted in a weak reduction in H3K4me1 levels (<a href=\"#bib9\">Herz et al., 2012</a>), which we confirmed (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement1</a>).

However, when we examined mutant clones of <i>yki</i> in the wing imaginal discs, we could not detect any changes in the global levels of H3K4me1, H3K4me2, or H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement1</a>)."

Interestingly, a previous genome-wide analysis in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells revealed that <i>diap1</i> and <i>ex</i>, two well-characterized Hippo target genes, display such differential enrichment of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at the respective region of each gene (<a href=\"#bib9\">Herz et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To examine the contribution of Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr to H3K4 methylation at these Hippo target genes, we knocked down each protein in S2R+ cells and performed ChIP analysis with antibodies against H3K4me1 and H3K4me3. RNAi knockdown of Yki, Ncoa6 or Trr resulted in a decrease of H3K4me3 in the TSS-proximal region of <i>diap1</i> and <i>ex</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), which normally showed the strongest enrichment of H3K4me3 marks (<a href=\"#bib9\">Herz et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). RNAi knockdown of Yki, Ncoa6 or Trr also led to a decrease of H3K4me1 in the intronic HRE of <i>diap1</i> and an upstream region of <i>diap1</i> or <i>ex</i> which normally showed the strongest enrichment of H3K4me1 marks (<a href=\"#bib9\">Herz et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which Yki regulates tissue growth and target gene expression has important implications for developmental and cancer biology. Previous studies have established that Yki functions primarily as a coactivator for Sd and that Yki promotes tissue growth by antagonizing Sd's repressor function (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Koontz et al., 2013</a>). Our current study has extended the previous work by identifying Ncoa6 as a Yki-binding cofactor that is required for the expression of Yki target genes. The ability of the SdDB-Ncoa6 fusion protein to rescue the growth and transcriptional defects in <i>yki</i> mutant clones highlights the importance of Ncoa6 recruitment in the transcriptional output of the Hippo pathway. Our results further suggest that Ncoa6 recruits the Trr methyltransferase complex to Hippo target genes and that Yki regulates target gene transcription by modulating local H3K4 methylation. Consistent with this view, a recent genome-wide chromatin-binding analysis revealed a correlation between Yki-bound chromatin and peaks of H3K4me3 modification in <i>Drosophila</i> wing discs and embryos (<a href=\"#bib21\">Oh et al., 2013</a>). We note that, besides the H3K4 methyltransferases, the mammalian Ncoa6 has been reported to potentiate the activity of transcription factors by interacting with histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300 and several RNA binding proteins (CAPER, CoAA and PIMT) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mahajan and Samuels, 2008</a>). Whether these additional mechanisms also contribute to the function of Ncoa6 in Yki-mediated growth control requires further investigation. Given the biological and clinical significance of the Hippo pathway, further studies into the molecular mechanism of Ncoa6 will advance our understanding of developmental growth control and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

Thus, its steady-state subcellular localization in a cell reflects the equilibrium of nuclear import/retention and cytoplasmic export/retention. Any conditions that increase nuclear retention, as by the overexpression of the nuclear FLAG-Ncoa6 protein, would shift the equilibrium to the nucleus. Conversely, conditions that increase cytoplasmic retention, as by the binding of the cytoplasmic protein 14-3-3, would shift the localization towards the cytoplasm. In order to better convey the point that the snapshot of Yki localization in our co-transfection experiment is the equilibrium of a dynamic process, we use \u201cnuclear accumulation\u201d instead of \u201cnuclear translocation\u201d in the revised manuscript."

Following the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we examined whether knocking down Ncoa6 affects Yki localization and the results were mixed. We found that Ncoa6 knockdown in S2R+ cells led to decreased nuclear localization of HA-Yki, although it had no obvious effect on endogenous Yki. This data is included for your perusal at the end of this letter (Figure A\u2013B).
