In this network, the periodic firing fields of grid cells act as a metric element for position. The location of the grid firing fields depends on interactions between self-motion information, geometrical properties of the environment and nonmetric contextual cues. Here, we test whether visual information, including nonmetric contextual cues, also regulates the firing rate of MEC neurons. Removal of visual landmarks caused a profound impairment in grid cell periodicity. Moreover, the speed code of MEC neurons changed in darkness and the activity of border cells became less confined to environmental boundaries. Half of the MEC neurons changed their firing rate in darkness. Manipulations of nonmetric visual cues that left the boundaries of a 1D environment in place caused rate changes in grid cells. These findings reveal context specificity in the rate code of MEC neurons."

In this network, the periodic firing fields of grid cells act as a metric element for position. The location of the grid firing fields depends on interactions between self-motion information, geometrical properties of the environment and nonmetric contextual cues. Here, we test whether visual information, including nonmetric contextual cues, also regulates the firing rate of MEC neurons. Removal of visual landmarks caused a profound impairment in grid cell periodicity. Moreover, the speed code of MEC neurons changed in darkness and the activity of border cells became less confined to environmental boundaries. Half of the MEC neurons changed their firing rate in darkness. Manipulations of nonmetric visual cues that left the boundaries of a 1D environment in place caused rate changes in grid cells. These findings reveal context specificity in the rate code of MEC neurons."

The repetitive nature of the firing fields suggests that grid cells are an important metric element of a neuronal system involved in spatial navigation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McNaughton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Burgess et al., 2007</a>). To keep track of the animal\u2019s position during locomotion, grid cells appear to rely on self-motion cues (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, computational models suggest that grid cells integrate heading direction and traveled distance (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fuhs, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McNaughton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Burgess et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burak and Fiete, 2009</a>). The directional component likely depends on inputs from head-direction cells found in several subcortical and cortical areas, including the MEC (<a href=\"#bib51\">Taube et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Valerio and Taube, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Winter et al., 2015</a>). Traveled distance, on the other hand, could be estimated from the firing rate of speed cells located in the MEC (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kropff et al., 2015</a>). As expected from an internal speedometer, the increase of the firing rate of speed cells as a function of running velocity is preserved across different environments (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kropff et al., 2015</a>)."

A mechanism is therefore needed to prevent the position estimate from rapidly deviating from the actual location of the animal. External landmarks, including the borders of the enclosure, serve this purpose (<a href=\"#bib25\">Knierim et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Skaggs et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Evans et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hardcastle et al., 2015</a>). The influence of landmarks on grid cell activity is illustrated by cue control experiments in which the rotation of a single polarizing visual landmark causes an equivalent reorientation of the grid pattern (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>), and by the reduced spatial selectivity of grid cells in darkness (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, compression of a familiar rectangular environment along one axis can lead to a contraction of the grid pattern in the same axis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barry et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>) and grid orientation aligns to the environment borders with a small but constant offset (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krupic et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stensola et al., 2015</a>). Finally, there is also evidence that the color and odor of an enclosure can affect the positioning of the grid fields but not the grid orientation or the firing rate of the neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Marozzi et al., 2015</a>). Thus, visual landmarks within an environment prevent error accumulation in grid cell networks and anchor the grid fields to the environment."

On one hand, the role of visual information could be limited to ensuring long-term stability of the MEC spatial representations. In this scenario, the firing rate of MEC neurons would be context-invariant and remain unchanged by manipulations of visual landmarks (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fyhn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kropff et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Marozzi et al., 2015</a>). Alternatively, visual information could have a broader impact on the MEC network. For example, the firing rate and speed code of MEC neurons could be affected by visual inputs. In addition, nonmetric contextual information, which is independent from the shape and orientation of an enclosure, could be encoded in the firing activity of MEC neurons. We set out to test these two alternative views by recording the activity of MEC neurons in mice running in environments where access to visual landmarks was manipulated."

We therefore tested if the firing associations between grid cells were maintained even when the grid patterns were not stable. The instantaneous firing rate of grid cells was calculated (time window: 100 ms, gaussian smoothing kernel s.d: 100 ms) and the correlation coefficients between instantaneous firing rate vectors served as a measure of firing rate association.

If this is the case, the grid pattern should be visible in spike-triggered rate maps in which the effect of slow translational drift is minimized by resetting the position data each time a cell fires a spike (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bonnevie et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2014</a>). In these maps, each spike in turn served as a reference spike and the position of the animal in the 10 s following a reference spike was shifted so that the position of the animal at the time of the reference spike was (0,0). Spike-triggered maps of grid cells during light trials often showed a central field surrounded by 6 fields (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). During dark trials, the surrounding fields were less distinct or sometimes appeared as a ring of elevated activity. Accordingly, grid scores calculated from the spike-triggered maps were lower during d1 than l1 trials (<i>n</i> = 139 grid cells, median l1: 0.054, median d1: \u22120.062, <i>v</i> = 12246, p=0.00011).

Significance levels were obtained on a cell-by-cell basis by shuffling trial identities 500 times to obtain a distribution of discrimination indices. The 99th percentiles of the surrogate distributions served as significance levels. Only periods during which the running speed of the mice was between 5 and 20 cm/s were used. Examples of neurons with a significant rate change between light and dark trials are shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>.

This suggests that the firing rate of spatially selective neurons in the MEC could also convey information about the distinct visual stimuli present in an environment. We therefore performed a second experiment with a new cohort of mice to test whether the rate code of MEC neurons discriminates different nonmetric visual landmarks (or contexts) in an otherwise unchanged environment. The activity of 479 neurons (5 mice, 48 recording sessions) was recorded as mice ran back and forth on a linear track flanked by two side walls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Histological analysis indicated that 14 recording sites were in the MEC, 4 in the MEC/parasubiculum border, and 13 in the parasubiculum (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 2</a>). There were 3 lighting conditions (l1, l2 and d). In l1, a single row of 48 LEDs on one wall was turned on. In l2, 4 rows of 12 LEDs located on the opposite wall were turned on. In d, all LEDs were turned off. The condition was changed randomly every 5th run.

This instability was greater than previously reported (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, our analysis indicates that instability in the grid pattern was detectable within the first few seconds in darkness. Several factors could contribute to this grid instability. First, the circular arena had no wall in the current experiment. This eliminates a potential source of uncontrolled olfactory or tactile cues that the animal can use to anchor its spatial representation in darkness. Second, two polarizing LED panels were used during the recording sessions and repeatedly caused reorientations of the MEC spatial representations. The spatial relationships between the grid pattern and uncontrolled external cues were therefore not stable over time. This might have reduced the contribution of uncontrolled external cues to the anchoring of MEC spatial representations during dark trials. Third, it has also been suggested that border cells reset cumulative error in the grid cell network when an animal encounters a boundary (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hardcastle et al., 2015</a>). Thus, the altered spatial representation by border cells in darkness might have contributed to grid cell instability. Our findings indicate that in environments deprived of salient landmarks, error in the estimation of position by grid cells accumulates faster than previously thought."

It is thought that this speed code in the MEC remains unchanged across different contexts (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kropff et al., 2015</a>). Our findings, instead, point to an important contribution of visual cues, and perhaps optic flow, to the speed code, as most speed-modulated neurons had a lower firing rate in darkness. Speed-modulated neurons included high firing rate interneurons but also a significant proportion of grid cells and other spatially selective neurons. GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin were more likely to have high speed scores compared to other MEC neurons. The analysis of functional connections onto these GABAergic neurons indicated that cells pre-synaptic to speed cells decreased their firing rate during dark trials, providing a simple explanation for the reduction in firing rate of GABAergic speed cells. As speed-modulated neurons have been observed in several brain regions (<a href=\"#bib36\">McNaughton et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Saleem et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bender et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fuhrmann et al., 2015</a>), it will be important to establish which pathways are required for the speed modulation of MEC neurons and whether these afferent speed signals are also modulated by visual landmarks."

This demonstrates that the level of activity in the MEC network during navigation is not constant but varies depending on the visual cues present in an environment. Although cells of all functionally defined cell types responded to light, border cells appear especially sensitive to manipulation of visual inputs. An important cortical afferent carrying visual information to the MEC originates in the postrhinal cortex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burwell and Amaral, 1998a</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">1998b</a>) and has a depolarizing effect on principal neurons of the MEC (<a href=\"#bib26\">Koganezawa et al., 2015</a>). It is tempting to speculate that this projection is more active when visual landmarks are present. This could explain why the firing rate of MEC neurons was generally lower in darkness."

This demonstrates that the rate code of grid cells in 1D environments is context specific. It has recently been proposed that grid cells in rats trained to perform a conditional discrimination task can encode object information (<a href=\"#bib23\">Keene et al., 2016</a>). Our findings complement this study by showing that changes in firing rate caused by contextual information do not strictly depend on the behavioral demands of the task. Indeed, on the linear track the mice did not have to change their behavior following contextual changes. Inclusion of contextual information in the rate code of grid cells might take place continuously during 1D navigation. The rate change of MEC neurons associated with distinct contexts on the linear track is in agreement with Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity changes observed in MEC Reelin<sup>+</sup> cells following exploration of different enclosures (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kitamura et al., 2015</a>).

One hypothesis is that the location of the grid fields remains stable but that visual inputs onto grid cells alter their in-field firing rates. Such rate changes within stable fields have already been observed in hippocampal place cells during 2D navigation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>) or during different memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lipton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ferbinteanu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ainge et al., 2012</a>). An alternative hypothesis is that the rate changes reflect a shift in the location of the grid firing fields caused by the nonmetric contextual cues (<a href=\"#bib33\">Marozzi et al., 2015</a>). If one considers 1D firing maps on the track as slices through the 2D map of the neurons (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yoon et al., 2016</a>), the 1D maps of grid cells in two contexts on the linear track could be considered as slices with different phases or orientations. It is also possible that the contextual cues affect the periodicity of the underlying 2D grid lattice (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krupic et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stensola et al., 2015</a>). Both hypotheses remain plausible at this time, but the high correlations between the linear firing rate maps in the two contexts indicate that the change of field location was minimal. Regardless of the precise mechanisms, the outcome is that the rate code of grid cells along 1D paths is context dependent. Since navigation in the real world is often confined to preexisting paths, the firing rate of grid cells in these conditions provides information not only about the position of the animal but also about the visual cues encountered along the path."

(2005, Nature) or than that in a previous experiment from our group (Allen et al., 2015, Journal of Neuroscience). Many factors are possibly involved. For example, the circular arena in the current experiment had no wall. This likely removed a potential source of polarizing cues from the environment. In addition, using two light cues located at 90 or 180 degrees to each other can have at least 2 effects. As pointed out by the reviewer, it might generate large error signals when the light is switched back on after a dark trial and this might affect how the animal anchors its internal representation to the external world. A second consequence of having 2 lights is that uncontrolled cues left on the arena by the animal do not have a stable position within the internal representation of the animal. It is possible that these local cues normally contribute to the spatial stability of the grid network in darkness and that using two different lights reduces their contribution."
