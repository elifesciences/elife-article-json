We investigated combinatorial translational regulation by <i>Drosophila</i> Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos), which control development, fertility, and neuronal functions. Our results show how the specificity of one RBP (Pum) is modulated by cooperative RNA recognition with a second RBP (Nos) to synergistically repress mRNAs. Crystal structures of Nos-Pum-RNA complexes reveal that Nos embraces Pum and RNA, contributes sequence-specific contacts, and increases Pum RNA-binding affinity. Nos shifts the recognition sequence and promotes repression complex formation on mRNAs that are not stably bound by Pum alone, explaining the preponderance of sub-optimal Pum sites regulated <i>in vivo</i>. Our results illuminate the molecular mechanism of a regulatory switch controlling crucial gene expression programs, and provide a framework for understanding how the partnering of RBPs evokes changes in binding specificity that underlie regulatory network dynamics."

We investigated combinatorial translational regulation by <i>Drosophila</i> Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos), which control development, fertility, and neuronal functions. Our results show how the specificity of one RBP (Pum) is modulated by cooperative RNA recognition with a second RBP (Nos) to synergistically repress mRNAs. Crystal structures of Nos-Pum-RNA complexes reveal that Nos embraces Pum and RNA, contributes sequence-specific contacts, and increases Pum RNA-binding affinity. Nos shifts the recognition sequence and promotes repression complex formation on mRNAs that are not stably bound by Pum alone, explaining the preponderance of sub-optimal Pum sites regulated <i>in vivo</i>. Our results illuminate the molecular mechanism of a regulatory switch controlling crucial gene expression programs, and provide a framework for understanding how the partnering of RBPs evokes changes in binding specificity that underlie regulatory network dynamics."

Proteins perform many different roles and each needs to be produced at the right time and in the right amounts to enable the cells to survive. The DNA is first copied to make molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA), which are then used as templates to make the proteins. One way to control protein production is to regulate the RNA molecules. A family of proteins called RNA-binding proteins can recognise and bind to specific RNA molecules and determine whether a RNA molecule is destroyed, used to produce proteins, or stored for later use. In effect, these RNA-binding proteins act as switches that turn protein production on or off."

To investigate how Nanos and Pumilio work together to regulate protein production, Weidmann, Qiu et al. used a variety of techniques to study the activity of these proteins in cells taken from fruit fly embryos."

The presence of Nanos allows Pumilio to regulate RNAs that it cannot bind to alone. Therefore, the experiments show that by working together with Nanos, Pumilio is able to regulate a wider variety of RNAs than it would otherwise be able to. These findings provide a molecular understanding for why fruit fly mutants that lack Nanos or Pumilio have severe body defects and reduced fertility. The next challenge is to identify the specific RNAs targeted by Nanos and Pumilio in stem cells, the nervous system and during development."

We explored the hypothesis that Nos promotes repression by modulating the RNA-binding activity of Pum. We show that Nos enhances the cellular repression activity and in vitro RNA-binding affinity of Pum. Moreover, Nos contacts nucleotides upstream of the PRE. In doing so, Nos alters the specificity of the repression complex and promotes repression of RNAs that are not stably bound by Pum alone. We performed RNA target selection and high-throughput sequencing, which, together with RNA-binding and cellular repression assays, demonstrate that Nos diversifies Pum RNA regulatory networks."

Conserved tandem ZFs are necessary for RNA binding (<a href=\"#bib13\">Curtis et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</a>), and mutations that disrupt either ZF (C319Y or C354Y) completely blocked Nos repression activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Similarly, a Nos variant lacking the C-terminal region (NZ) displayed limited repression activity, 16% repression versus 79% for full-length Nos (NZC). In contrast, a Nos variant lacking the N-terminal region (ZC) retained 43% repression. No individual Nos region (N, Z, or C) was sufficient for repression. These findings indicate that multiple regions of Nos contribute to enhancing Pum-mediated repression: the ZFs and the C-terminal region are crucial, and the N-terminal region makes a minor contribution. Because the Nos ZC region retained most of the Nos-enhanced repression activity and was amenable to biochemical and structural studies, we focused on determining its mechanism of action."

Strikingly, the structure illustrates how the Nos tandem ZFs envelop the RNA bases immediately upstream of the PRE and, together with the C-terminal region, embrace both the RNA and Pum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>). We crystalized Pum and Nos with a <i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA, 5\u00b4-AAAU<span class=\"underline\">UGUACAUA</span>AGCC (the core PRE sequence is underlined, and we designate the first U of the core PRE as position +1 and number the four upstream nucleotides as \u22121 to \u22124).

In addition, the C-terminal \u03b1 helix of Pum (helix \u03b12 of repeat R8\u00b4) unfolds to promote interaction of residues with the upstream RNA backbone (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Since the upstream nucleotides were not present in the binary complex, the change in the structure of the C-terminal region of Pum may be induced by the presence of the upstream RNA and/or Nos. With these conformational changes, Pum and Nos interact with one another and together recognize RNA immediately 5\u00b4 of the core PRE motif."

The RNA-binding domain of Pum (PUM-HD) bound <i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA, and addition of equimolar Nos ZC to the binding reaction further retarded the <i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA mobility, indicating formation of a Nos-Pum-RNA ternary complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2015figure supplement 1</a>). Disruption of either ZF of Nos (C319Y or C354Y) eliminated ternary complex formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In addition, the Pum-<i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA interaction is essential for Nos binding, as RNA-binding deficient Pum mutR7 did not support a ternary complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Nos did not shift <i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA on its own (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), even at protein concentrations of one micromolar (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We applied the EMSA quantitatively and found that Nos binds with high affinity to the Pum-<i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>) and increases Pum binding affinity for <i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA by 3-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>).

Since deletion of the C-terminal region severely limited Nos repression of the <i>hb</i> 3\u00b4UTR reporter in cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), we probed this interaction more precisely. We tested a \u0394376\u2013382 deletion, which eliminated much of the Pum-binding interface and corresponds to the lesion in the <i>nos</i><sup>L7</sup> allele that disrupts Nos function <i>in vivo</i>\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Curtis et al., 1997</a>). This deletion impaired Nos repression activity to a similar extent as deletion of the entire C-terminal region: 27% repression compared to 14% repression for Nos NZ (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Since our crystal structure indicates that the deleted region includes part of the C-terminal helix that interacts with Pum, it is possible that the protein, although expressed, could be incorrectly folded. We further examined this region by introducing single amino acid substitutions, including the I376<sub>Nos</sub> and M378<sub>Nos</sub> residues that contact Pum in the structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Repression activity of Nos I376A was diminished to 46%, and more so for Nos M378A (29%), whereas Nos I382A caused a modest decrease to 60%, relative to 70% repression by wild type Nos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). A \u0394383\u2013393 deletion, which removed the final three ordered residues in the structure and eight subsequent residues, also diminished repression activity to 43% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, a \u0394394\u2013401 deletion retained full repression activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These C-terminal eight residues of Nos were disordered in the ternary complex structure, and therefore did not contact Pum. These results confirm the functional importance of the observed protein contacts between Pum and Nos for regulation in cells."

Another mutant, K368Q, designed to eliminate a salt bridge interaction with the phosphate group of \u22121U, reduced repression activity to 32% vs 75% for WT protein. Mutations targeting interactions with nucleotides\u22122A and \u22123A (N325A and Y352A) had smaller, but measurable effects on repression activity.

Substitution of both the \u22121 and \u22122 positions of <i>hb</i> NRE2 with cytosine had been shown previously to disrupt abdominal segmentation, but did not affect Pum RNA association (<a href=\"#bib43\">Murata and Wharton, 1995</a>), so we designed <i>hb</i> NRE2 RNAs that substituted cytosine bases at either the \u22121 or \u22122 position (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>,\u00a0\u22121C and \u22122C). Neither mutation hindered RNA binding by Pum, but both mutations blocked ternary complex formation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). We then probed whether the cytosine substitutions in the NBS affect mRNA regulation in cells using reporters bearing a 3\u00b4UTR with a single <i>hb</i> NRE (RnLuc 1x <i>hb</i> NRE2). Expression of full-length Nos resulted in 50% repression of WT reporter activity compared to the negative control Halo-tag protein alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), similar to a mutant <i>hb</i> 3\u00b4UTR reporter with only a functional NRE2 sequence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, mt1). In contrast, Nos did not repress mutant \u22121C or \u22122C reporters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), consistent with disruption of ternary complex formation by these substitutions. Thus, the identities of the nucleotides in the NBS are critical for repression activity. Although we did not observe sequence-specific contacts to the \u22122A base in our crystal structure of the ternary complex, this likely reflects the modest 3.7\u2009\u00c5 resolution that was not sufficient to resolve all direct contacts or identify water molecules that may mediate protein-RNA interaction."

Using EMSAs, we found that Nos induced formation of a Nos-Pum-RNA ternary complex, even when Pum alone did not bind stably to RNA. The <i>Cyclin B (CycB</i>) NRE contains a PRE that diverges from the consensus with uracils in place of adenines at positions +6 and +8, and it has a different NBS sequence (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Pum alone did not form a stable complex with <i>CycB</i> NRE RNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, left, and <a href=\"#fig6\">6B</a>), but remarkably, addition of Nos ZC resulted in ternary complex formation with an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of 12 nM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, right, and <a href=\"#fig6\">6B</a>), similar to the 8.7 nM K<sub>d</sub> for <i>hb</i> NRE2.

As expected, mutating +3U to G (<i>hb</i> PRE2 +3G) prevented stable binding of Pum alone (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2015figure supplement 3</a>). Yet, similar to the <i>Cyclin B</i> and <i>bicoid</i> NREs, addition of Nos ZC conferred formation of a ternary complex with a K<sub>d</sub> of 59.9 nM. In contrast, mutating UGU to ACA (<i>hb</i> PRE2 ACA) abolished both Pum binding and ternary complex formation (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2015figure supplement 4</a>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that Nos can stabilize binding of Pum to RNAs containing a wider range of consensus or divergent NREs, but cannot overcome complete disruption of the UGU trinucleotide sequence."

The protein structures are essentially unchanged compared to the complex with <i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA; however, differences in Pum binding to bases +5 to +8 result in distinct conformations of <i>hb</i> and <i>CycB</i> RNAs in this region (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2015figure supplement 5</a>). Pum binds to the <i>hb</i> PRE2 using the base-omission mode observed for human Pumilio1 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lu and Hall, 2011</a>), where bases +4 and +5 stack directly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In contrast, Pum appears to bind to the <i>CycB</i> PRE using the 1 repeat:1 RNA base PUF recognition mode with R1271<sub>Pum</sub> sandwiched between bases +4 and +5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Pum binds specifically to the 3\u00b4 AUA sequence at positions +6 to +8 of <i>hb</i> PRE2 RNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). However, for the <i>CycB</i> RNA, recognition of +6U is suboptimal and the +8U nucleotide is disordered in the ternary complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Thus, Nos stabilizes binding of Pum to RNAs that do not match the PRE consensus sequence in the 3\u00b4 half, reducing Pum specificity to allow regulation of a broader range of mRNA targets than Pum alone."

Strikingly, addition of Nos to immobilized Pum enriched A/U-rich sequences upstream of the 5\u00b4-UGUA of the PRE (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2015figure supplement 2</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig7s3\">3</a>), consistent with Nos recognition of the NBS.

Moreover, multiple weak NREs, such as 3x <i>CycB</i> NRE or 3x <i>hb</i> NRE2 +3G, confer substantial repression that approaches the level of a single strong NRE (e.g. 1x <i>hb</i> NRE2).

To understand their regulatory functions, the emerging challenge is to classify these regulatory RBPs by their protein folds, specificities, <i>in vivo</i> target RNAs, and expression patterns. Furthermore, as the regulatory targets of individual RBPs are established, it will be crucial to examine overlapping networks to identify cooperative regulation by multiple RBPs. However, our current knowledge of how multiple RBPs collaboratively regulate an mRNA is limited. In this context, the mechanisms of combinatorial regulation by Nos and Pum revealed in this study, which visually capture decades of genetic and biochemical data, provide a foundation to derive general principles for how RBPs co-regulate target mRNAs."

The Nos C-terminal region that contacts Pum is conserved within Diptera, but substantially diverges beyond that order (<a href=\"#bib12\">Curtis et al., 1995</a>). Vertebrates have three Nos orthologs which share the tandem Nos ZFs but diverge substantially in their C termini. For example, the C termini of human Nos proteins are not homologous to each other or <i>Drosophila</i> Nos. The amino acid sequence of the 42-residue C-terminus of human NOS1 is enriched in prolines and is conserved throughout vertebrate NOS1 orthologs. The sequence of the 23-residue C-terminus of human NOS2 is enriched in arginines and is conserved among vertebrate NOS2 orthologs. Likewise, the sequence of the 63-residue C-terminus of human NOS3 is only shared by vertebrate NOS3 proteins. We also analyzed the conservation of the Nos-binding interface of Pum proteins and find that the contacts points observed in the Nos-Pum structure are conserved in Dipteran orthologs, but diverge throughout the tree of life. For example, residues equivalent to Pum Q1337 and F1367 change to proline and methionine, respectively, in vertebrate Pum homologs. In addition, vertebrate PUM proteins possess a three residue (GPH) insertion in the R7-R8 loop region that could augment protein contacts with vertebrate Nos proteins. Interestingly, deletion of these residues allows human Pum1 to interact with <i>Drosophila</i> Nos (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</a>)."

First, the direct interaction between <i>Drosophila</i> Nos and Pum might be unique to Dipterans; however, Nos and Pum homologs from <i>C. elegans, Xenopus</i> and humans have been reported to interact and a simple loop deletion allows human Pum1 to interact with <i>Drosophila</i> Nos (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jaruzelska et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kraemer et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lolicato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nakahata et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sonoda and Wharton 1999</a>). Instead, the Nos and Pum contacts likely coevolved as the number of Nos and Pum homologs increased, perhaps restricting interactions between particular Nos and Pum proteins. Nos and Pum homologs may also interact indirectly, mediated by a bridging partner(s), as was suggested for <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kraemer et al., 1999</a>) and mouse (<a href=\"#bib50\">Suzuki et al., 2016</a>)."

Nos specifically recognizes the 5\u00b4 sequence only in the context of the ternary complex and also induces a localized conformational change of Pum that adds contacts with the phosphate backbone of nucleotides -1 to -4. Previous reports indicated that the Nos tandem ZFs in isolation exhibit non-specific RNA binding (<a href=\"#bib13\">Curtis et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hashimoto et al., 2010</a>). With our structure-based definition of the NBS, we find that the mutations in the RNAs tested by Curtis <i>et al.</i> were outside the NBS and thus would not have detected sequence-specific differences in Nos binding. With our findings, we can now attribute the negative effect of NBS mutations on abdominal segmentation <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wharton et al., 1998</a>) and ternary complex formation in yeast three-hybrid assays (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</a>) to the loss of RNA recognition by Nos. Intriguingly, these newly identified Nos and Pum contacts with the 5\u00b4 NBS relax the sequence recognition requirements at the 3\u00b4 end of the PRE (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), thereby allowing Nos and Pum to regulate mRNA targets bearing imperfect PREs, including <i>CycB</i> and <i>bcd</i>, that are not bound stably by Pum alone. As a result, the cooperative activity of a second RBP (Nos) adds upstream RNA sequence specificity, which alters mRNA target selection of the primary RBP (Pum) and diversifies the range of target sequences."

Similar to Nos and Pum, Sxl and Unr proteins interact with each other only in the presence of target RNA, cooperatively interacting with a regulatory element that contains binding sites for each protein. Sxl and Unr recognize the RNA nucleotides between their individual binding sites, forming a sandwich or a \u201ctriple zipper\u201d arrangement that creates a longer recognition element than either protein alone. Nos and Pum recognize their respective NBS and PRE elements; however, Nos recognition of the 5\u00b4 NBS and clamp-like binding to Pum and RNA relaxes the sequence requirements of Pum interaction with the 3\u00b4 end of the PRE, as with <i>CycB</i> mRNA, which effectively shifts the recognition sequence, rather than extending it. As a consequence, Nos and Pum cooperatively bind to RNAs that neither protein stably binds on its own."

Our analysis of Pum target mRNAs using the SEQRS-derived Nos-Pum motif indicates that the majority of Pum target mRNAs contain the Nos-Pum motif but lack the full canonical PRE Pum recognition sequence. This suggests that, in addition to strengthening Pum repression activity, Nos can alter the identity of mRNAs regulated by Pum. Moreover, enrichment of specific gene ontology terms in the mRNAs bearing the Nos-Pum motif suggest that Nos can alter the biological functions controlled by Pum (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These analyses allude to the utility of the combinatorial specificity <i>in vivo</i> and explain broadened regulation by Nos and Pum in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos and adults."

                        "text": "In addition to altering sequence specificity, our studies highlight other advantages of combinatorial RNA target regulation by Nos and Pum in vivo. First, repression is responsive to the Nos protein concentration. In the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, the Nos protein gradient is highest at the posterior end where <i>hb</i> expression must be repressed for abdomen formation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barker et al., 1992</a>). We showed that higher Nos levels induced greater repression of reporters bearing <i>hb</i> NREs, mirroring the effect in the embryonic posterior. Interestingly, the expression of Nos is dynamic over the course of development and likely modulates Pum activity temporally as well as spatially (<a href=\"#bib31\">Wang and Lehmann, 1991</a>). Second, repression is affected by the sequence of the NREs; reporters bearing imperfect PREs were also repressed, but required higher Nos protein levels for equivalent effect. Third, the number of Nos-Pum binding sites in the mRNA modulates regulatory activity. For example, <i>hb</i> mRNA bears two NREs, each with consensus NBS and PRE sites. We found that each site was highly responsive to Nos-enhanced, Pum-mediated repression, and multiple sites conferred greater responsiveness. Repression of the <i>CycB</i> PRE reporter required higher concentrations of transfected Nos, mirroring the requirement for concentrated Nos protein in pole cells where <i>CycB</i> translation is repressed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Asaoka-Taguchi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kadyrova et al., 2007</a>). Inclusion of three <i>CycB</i> PREs supported repression at lower Nos concentrations, consistent with previous studies showing how the number and quality of PREs in the <i>hb</i> 3\u00b4UTR, and the amount of Nos protein expressed, confer the precise level of regulation upon the <i>hb</i> transcript in embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wharton and Struhl, 1991</a>). Indeed, although the <i>CycB</i> mRNA 3\u00b4 UTR contains no perfect PRE, it does contain 7 sequence elements with an NBS upstream of a partial PRE with the 5\u00b4 UGU sequence. Together, these results define multiple parameters that contribute to biologically relevant levels of regulatory activity."

For example, the Brain Tumor (Brat) protein contributes to repression of <i>hb</i> expression in the embryo by recognizing an element located upstream of the NBS and PRE in each NRE (i.e. the so-called Box A motif) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Laver et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Loedige et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sonoda and Wharton, 2001</a>). Moreover, additional partner proteins can modulate RNA binding of PUF proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Menichelli et al., 2013</a>) and the Nos-Pum-RNA ternary complex suggests common mechanisms of co-regulation. For instance, RNA-binding affinity and specificity of the <i>C. elegans</i> PUF protein, FBF-2, is modulated by interactions with CPB-1 (Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation element Binding protein 1) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Menichelli et al., 2013</a>). Intriguingly, CPB-1 and other partners bind to a region of FBF-2 that corresponds to the R7-R8 loop of Pum that binds Nos (<a href=\"#bib9\">Campbell et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Menichelli et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the Nos-Pum-RNA complex exemplifies a protein-protein interaction hotspot (<a href=\"#bib9\">Campbell et al., 2012b</a>). Our results indicate that formation of PUF protein-partner complexes can alter the PUF protein conformation to create additional protein-RNA contacts that strengthen RNA binding while modulating target specificity and regulation."

This paradigm emphasizes the importance of understanding how the multitude of RNA-binding factors collaborate to control mRNA stability, translation, processing, and localization."

The Ni elution buffer contained 20\u2009mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50\u2009mM NaCl, 0.2\u2009M imidazole, and 1\u2009mM DTT. A gradient elution was run on the heparin column with buffer A containing 20\u2009mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 1\u2009mM DTT and buffer B containing additional 1\u2009M NaCl. The Superdex 75 column buffer contains 20\u2009mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.15\u2009M NaCl, and 2\u2009mM DTT. For the ternary complex formation, a 16-nt <i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA (5\u00b4-AAAU<span class=\"underline\">UGUACAUA</span>AGCC) and a 14-nt <i>CycB</i> NRE RNA (5\u00b4-UAUU<span class=\"underline\">UGUAAUUU</span>AU) were used, separately. Purified Pum and Nos were concentrated and mixed together with RNA in a molar ratio of 1:1:1.1. After overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C, the mixture was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column. Peak fractions containing ternary complexes were concentrated to OD<sub>280</sub> ~ 7 in a buffer of 20\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.15\u2009M NaCl, and 2\u2009mM DTT for crystallization. For the Pum-RNA binary complex, concentrated Pum (OD<sub>280</sub>~4.0) was incubated with 8-nt <i>hb</i> PRE2 RNA (5\u00b4-<span class=\"underline\">UGUACAUA)</span> in a molar ratio of 1:1.2 on ice for 2\u2009hr. The mixture was directly put into crystallization trays. Binary complexes were also formed with 12-nt <i>hb</i> NRE2 RNA (5\u00b4-AAAU<span class=\"underline\">UGUACAUA</span>), but no crystals were obtained."

The proteins were purified as described above for EMSA experiments except that Magnetic Halolink beads (Promega) were used and the Pum test proteins remained covalently bound via N-terminal Halotag to the beads. For Nos alone (sample 2), Nos remained linked to the magnetic beads. For the other samples that contained Nos (samples 3 and 5), Nos protein was cleaved from the beads using TEV protease and equimolar amount was added to the Pum-linked beads. The initial RNA library was transcribed from 1\u2009\u03bcg of input dsDNA using the AmpliScribe T7-Flash Transcription Kit (Epicentre). 200 ng of DNase treated RNA library was added to 100 nM of Halo-tagged proteins immobilized onto magnetic resin (Promega). The volume of each binding reaction was 100\u2009\u03bcl in SEQRS buffer containing 200 ng yeast tRNA competitor and 0.1 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega). The samples were incubated for 30\u2009min at 22\u00b0C prior to magnetic capture of the protein-RNA complex. The binding reaction was aspirated and the beads were washed four times with 200\u2009\u03bcl of ice cold SEQRS buffer. After the final wash step, resin was suspended in elution buffer (1\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0) containing 10 pmol of the reverse transcription primer. Samples were heated to 65\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and then cooled on ice. A 5\u2009\u03bcl aliquot of the sample was added to a 10\u2009\u03bcl ImProm-II reverse transcription reaction (Promega). The ssDNA product was used as a template for 25 cycles of PCR using a 50\u2009\u03bcl GoTaq reaction (Promega). Sequencing data were processed as described (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell et al., 2012a</a>). Sequence logos corresponding to consensus binding motifs were generated by MEME analysis of the 100 most-enriched sequences (reported in\u00a0<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bailey et al., 2006</a>). Enrichment of Pum and Nos-Pum binding sites in 3\u00b4UTRs was analyzed for all mRNAs and for mRNAs bound by Pum <i>in vivo</i> using the dataset from <a href=\"#bib18\">Gerber et al., 2006</a>. Pattern matching to the Pum and Nos-Pum motifs reported in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> were preformed using the grep Perl function from command line. Significance values compared to all 3'UTR sequences was determined using chi-squares test using GraphPad Prism (reported in <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 2</a>).\u00a0Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2008</a>) and Venn diagrams were generated using Venn Diagram Plotter (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)."

While the structures of Pumilio bound to RNA targets had been identified a while ago, it remained unclear how Nanos may regulate target specificity for a Pumilio-Nanos-NRE tertiary complex. In a beautiful set of experiments connecting in vitro binding and translational repression studies with structural analysis these questions are addressed in the present paper. The analysis is thorough and the data are well controlled and illustrated. The authors are able to identify a new sequence upstream of the Pumilio binding sites important for Nanos contact with RNA in the presence of Pumilio. It also represents one of the few examples of how two RBP cooperate to achieve sequence specificity and how one RBP (nanos) can modulate the sequence-specificity of the other one Pumilio. While this study does not include<i>in vivo</i> tests of the predicted interactions, several predictions have already been born out by previously published results. For example, <i>in vivo</i> studies had implicated sequences upstream of the canonical Pumilio binding sites in hb RNA regulation. Similarly, the new data illustrate the importance of the Nanos C-terminus in 'clamping' Pumilio to RNA, which was so far mostly implicated by genetics, for Nanos function in hb regulation and less so in germ line development."

We determined crystal structures of human Pum1 in complex with <i>hb</i> RNAs bearing five additional 5\u00b4 nucleotides. In one of the two Pum1:RNA complexes in the asymmetric unit, crystal packing influences the ordering of one additional upstream nucleotide. In the second complex, the upstream nucleotides were disordered and the C-terminal helix was formed as in the binary complex of Pum. The crystal packing in the area does not appear to restrict unfolding of the terminal helix or binding of the upstream RNA in the binary complex.
