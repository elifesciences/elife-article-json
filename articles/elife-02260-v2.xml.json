Previous studies indicate that neural activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) represents the gradual accumulation of evidence toward a threshold level, or evidence bound, which terminates the decision process. The level of this bound is hypothesized to mediate the speed-accuracy tradeoff. To test this, we recorded from LIP while monkeys performed a motion discrimination task in two speed-accuracy regimes. Surprisingly, the terminating threshold levels of neural activity were similar in both regimes. However, neurons recorded in the faster regime exhibited stronger evidence-independent activation from the beginning of decision formation, effectively reducing the evidence-dependent neural modulation needed for choice commitment. Our results suggest that control of speed vs accuracy may be exerted through changes in decision-related neural activity itself rather than through changes in the threshold applied to such neural activity to terminate a decision."

Under these conditions, the optimal strategy is to respond quickly at the expense of accuracy.

In the high speed regime, the starting point of the bound is nearer to the origin, and the rate of collapse is more severe. In the race-like architecture (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), a change in bound height is equivalent to a change in the starting point of both accumulations, and a collapsing bound is equivalent to a time-dependent, monotonically increasing signal that is also added to both accumulators. The neural responses are consistent with the idea that both components comprise a singular, evidence-independent signal that adds to the evidence-dependent activity in LIP. Nonetheless, one might ask how well each component alone could explain the behavioral changes between the two speed-accuracy regimes. To test this, we fit the behavioral data using only the baseline or only the time-dependent component of the neurally-derived, evidence-independent signal. The model comparison, summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, suggests that the time-dependent component of the signal is more important, although both components contribute to the fits in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, especially for monkey D.

Thus, the brain requires termination rules to end deliberation during a decision process. Just as the criterion in signal detection theory establishes a balance between false alarms and misses (<a href=\"#bib14\">Green and Swets, 1966</a>), a termination rule for a decision process can establish a balance between speed and accuracy. We found that monkeys can control their speed-accuracy policy via a process that changes the amount of accumulated evidence needed to commit to a choice. This is consistent with psychophysical studies in humans that suggest the SAT is implemented as a change in the decision bound (<a href=\"#bib39\">Reddi and Carpenter, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Reddi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Palmer et al., 2005</a>)."

Although we do not know which neurons in the brain are responsible for applying this threshold, a signature of the process is the stereotyped level of firing rate of LIP neurons just preceding a <i>T</i><sub><i>in</i></sub> decision. Interestingly, we found that the level of this threshold does not change when the monkey adopts a different speed-accuracy tradeoff. Instead of changing the level of the threshold, the brain changes the level of the starting point of the accumulation and adds a time-dependent signal to the accumulated evidence. The effect is to push the accumulated evidence closer to the fixed threshold. This dynamic, evidence-independent signal has been termed urgency (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ditterich, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Churchland et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cisek et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</a>) because it reflects the temporal cost associated with decision formation. It is mathematically equivalent to a collapsing bound because both mechanisms would alter the excursion of accumulated evidence from start to end of the decision, thereby allowing the brain to satisfy a mixture of desiderata related to time and evidence to terminate a decision. At the extremes of the mixture lie a temporal deadline or a fixed level of evidence (e.g., flat bound)."

The fits to even the simplest diffusion model (with flat bounds) indicate that the conversion from motion to accumulated evidence (e.g., drift rate) did not change consistently in the two regimes. This is further supported by the neural recordings. As adduced from the slopes of the graphs in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, a change in motion coherence induces the same change in buildup rate in both regimes. The constant offset between these graphs reflects an evidence-independent component of the neural response\u2014that is, the dynamic component of the urgency signal. This component combined with the change in baseline is mathematically equivalent to symmetrically collapsing bounds. Thus we were able to explain the difference in accuracy and RT in the two regimes by fixing all other parameters of the diffusion model to be identical between the two regimes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We simply introduced the urgency signals, measured physiologically, by converting from fraction of the firing rate \u2018bound\u2019 to the units of standard diffusion. The scaling itself (<i>\u03b1</i>; <a href=\"#equ9\">Equation 8</a>) was identical in the two regimes."

One possibility is that it simplifies the task of the downstream structures responsible for decision termination (<a href=\"#bib31\">Marshall et al., 2012</a>), rendering it similar to operations involved in simpler motor control (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hanes and Schall, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</a>). The neural computations involved in sensing a signal threshold crossing must be affected by the fidelity (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) of the signal, and it is well known that fidelity is greater at higher firing rates (because variance, not standard deviation, scales with mean firing rate). Indeed, it has been argued that some type of temporal smoothing is required to sense a threshold (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mazurek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heitz and Schall, 2012</a>). By fixing the threshold to a common level, the mechanism would avoid the need to compensate for these changes."

We have revealed one potential neural mechanism by which a policy change can affect a decision process. We believe that studying how such policy control can go awry is an essential step in better understanding disorders of higher brain function, for instance by explaining what leads to more careful or more impulsive decision making when individuals are faced with the same circumstances."

Visual stimuli were presented on a computer monitor (75 Hz frame rate) using the Psychophysics Toolbox for Matlab (<a href=\"#bib1a\">Brainard, 1997</a>). Trials began with the appearance of a single dot that the monkey was required to fixate. To minimize effects of anticipation on behavior and neural activity, random intervals between trial events were implemented using truncated exponential distributions, t<sub>min</sub> + exprnd(\u00b5), where exprnd is a random sample from an exponential distribution with mean = \u00b5. If the generated interval was longer than the maximum allowed time for the epoch (t<sub>max</sub>), the interval was resampled to ensure it was less than t<sub>max</sub>. After a variable delay (t<sub>min</sub> = 300 ms, \u00b5 = 300 ms, t<sub>max</sub> = 1 s), two bright red choice targets appeared at an equal distance from the fixation point and 180\u00b0 apart. After another variable delay (t<sub>min</sub> = 300 ms, \u00b5 = 300 ms, t<sub>max</sub> = 1.5 s), the random dot motion stimulus appeared in an aperture 5\u00b0 in diameter that was centered at the fixation point. The dynamic random dot stimulus consists of sets of random dots, which are shown for one video frame and then updated 40 ms later (e.g., dots in frame 1 were updated in frame 4; dots in frame 2 were updated in frame 5, and so forth). To update, each dot is either replaced at a random location, or displaced by 14.4 min arc (i.e., 6.0 deg s<sup>\u22121</sup>) with probability C (expressed as a percent), termed the motion coherence or motion strength.

Both monkeys achieved stable psychometric thresholds in this version of the task before proceeding to the RT version.

This eliminated any reward-based incentive to respond faster than the minimum delay to reward, encouraging longer deliberation times that would improve accuracy.

After the additional removal of the time out penalty for incorrect choices, one monkey (monkey E) slowly reached a faster speed set point over the course of 15 sessions. The other monkey (monkey D) required an additional manipulation. For 50% of trials, the motion stimulus was extinguished after 600 ms, so no further sensory information was available. After three sessions with this design, the monkey reached a faster speed set point. The task structure then reverted back to allowing the motion stimulus to be displayed indefinitely, and the monkey maintained the faster speed set point. After stable behavior was achieved in this regime, data were collected from 12 more LIP neurons (7 for monkey D, 5 for monkey E). For both monkeys, the behavior in these final fast speed sessions was similar to the earlier fast speed sessions that were collected before the high accuracy sessions (mean RT difference &lt;35 ms and mean accuracy difference &lt;2.5%). The main effects on neural responses were similar as well, so data were combined across the two sets of high speed sessions."

Responses for each neuron were normalized by division by the mean peri-saccadic response (0\u201350 ms prior to saccade initiation) measured during a block of visually-guided delayed saccade trials. The spikes from each trial were aligned with respect to two trial events. Spikes were aligned to motion onset and saccade initiation, respectively, for analyses of the beginning and end of the decision process. When aligning to motion onset, the time period within 100 ms before saccade initiation was excluded to reduce contamination of the averages with peri-saccadic activity. Similarly, when aligning to the saccade, the time period within 200 ms after motion onset was excluded to avoid contamination by the dip in firing rate that follows motion onset. Response averages (running means) were calculated after applying a symmetric (non-causal) boxcar filter to the spike trains (boxcar width = 50 ms), appropriately normalized."

The weighting is based on the time-dependent covariance of the running mean (i.e., the sample covariance of the boxcar filtered trials, divided by the number of trials), thereby correcting for temporal correlation induced by filtering and in the LIP responses themselves (<a href=\"#bib3\">Churchland et al., 2011</a>). The chosen analysis window was on the initial buildup, beginning 200 ms after motion onset and ending at the point in time when 50% of the trials were still included in the averages for each motion strength in the two speed-accuracy regimes, taking into account the RTs associated with each motion strength in each regime. The value of 200 ms is based on the established latency between stimulus motion (near the fovea) and the emergence of signals in LIP neurons that represent accumulation of evidence in favor of peripheral choice targets in the RFs of the neurons (<a href=\"#bib43\">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kiani et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Churchland et al., 2011</a>), and it is supported in the current study by the time of the earliest significant effects of stimulus strength on LIP responses. We chose an ending point that equated the attrition of trials from each of the averages\u2014that is, the fraction of trials that contribute to the averages. Attrition of trials associated with the fastest RTs biases the estimate of the buildup rate toward shallower slope because the faster rise times drop out of the average. An alternative approach would be to estimate the buildup rate using identical time intervals in both regimes, but Monte Carlo simulations revealed that it would result in a larger underestimation in the high speed regime than using an approach that based the endpoint on a matched level of trial attrition (results not shown). The latter approach does not eliminate the bias entirely, but it minimizes the difference in the bias of the buildup rate estimates in the two regimes."

Because of the noise inherent in measurements from single neurons, we estimated the evidence-independent signal by averaging responses across all motion strengths and choices. For the same reasons as described above, for each neuron we fit a line to the responses in an interval beginning 200 ms after stimulus onset and ending at a point in time when 50% of the trials for highest motion strength contributed to the average, thereby ensuring inclusion of at least 50% of trials at all time points for all motion strengths.

Because there is not an analytic solution for drift-diffusion with time-varying bounds, we solved for mean RTs and accuracy numerically (i.e., propagating the probability distributions of accumulated evidence to the absorption bounds). Importantly, the only differences in the model between the two regimes are the parameters in <a href=\"#equ8\">Equation 7</a> that are directly estimated from the neural responses. Thus, the neurally-constrained fitting procedure allows us to assess whether the measured differences in neural activity can account for the behavioral changes associated with SAT without any additional free parameters that are different between the two regimes."

In contrast, the authors observed an increase in baseline that seems (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>) much smaller (maybe 10%?), but once they discuss the rising urgency signal, they do not touch again on the original mechanism. Thus, the question remains, how much of the tradeoff is explained by the observed difference in excursion? There are two components to the increasing 'urgency' signal, an offset and a time-dependent component. In the model, it is possible to fit them either independently or simultaneously (i.e., to both conditions). So, how much of the effect is captured if just the offset (r0) varies across conditions (assuming a time-dependent component that is the same across conditions), and vice versa, how much of the effect is captured if the offset remains constant and only the time-dependent component is allowed to vary across conditions? This would provide a pretty good, quantitative indication of the importance of each term, and in particular, would resolve more quantitatively the original question implied in the Introduction: how well can a pure reduction in the excursion from baseline to threshold explain the observed tradeoff? Judging from the inset in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, the temporally varying component of the urgency signal seems much stronger than the offset, but really what matters is how well each component can account for the data."

We have improved the PSTHs. Instead of displaying mean responses connected by line segments, we show the running means of firing rates and enforce a more sensible rule for averaging as a function of time that we apply consistently in all graphs and analyses. The rationale for this change is explained in detail in response to item 2, below. The running means convey the variation in a direct way, and they have the virtue of replacing the line segments with actual data. (B) We now present results for each animal on the key analyses of the behavior and neural changes accompanying a change in speed-accuracy regime (<a href=\"#fig2 fig5 fig6\">Figures 2a, 5a, and 6</a>). (C) We have included a new analysis in the manuscript that displays the effects for individual neurons. The new scatter plot (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>) shows an association between variation of SAT from session to session and variation in the neural activity (the neural \u201curgency signal\u201d) in the corresponding session.

The starting point, 200 ms, is based on the established latency between stimulus motion (near the fovea) and decision-related activity in LIP neurons that represent the choice targets. This surprisingly long latency has been documented in several publications (e.g., Roitman et al. 2002; <a href=\"#bib19\">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Churchland et al., 2011</a>), and it is supported in the current study by the time of the earliest significant effects of stimulus strength on LIP responses. The ending point was guided by trial attrition. At longer times, progressively fewer trials contribute to the averages. In the revised manuscript, we apply a criterion of 50% attrition for each coherence in each SA regime; that is, we stop when fewer than half of the trials would contribute to the response. This is slightly different from what we did in the original submission, and we are grateful to the reviewers for pushing us to consider this issue more carefully. As the reviewers are aware, attrition of trials associated with the fastest RT biases the estimate of the buildup rate toward shallower slope (because the faster rise times drop out of the average). We used Monte Carlo methods to explore the bias introduced by a variety of attrition rules. We had originally chosen an endpoint for the regression to match the value of 50% attrition in the high speed regime, but we discovered that this strategy biased the estimates differently in the two SA regimes, as the reviewer suspected. We now apply the same 50% attrition rule to each motion strength in each of the SA regimes. This helps to clarify the relationship between the PSTHs in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a> and the buildup rates shown in the new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>. Like the original figure, the new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> shows that a change in motion strength affects the buildup rate similarly in the two regimes (compare the slopes). However, the new graph better clarifies a consistent difference in the absolute magnitude of the buildup rates in the two regimes (compare the offsets), which is consistent with the presence of an urgency signal that affects all buildup rates by roughly the same amount, albeit more so in the high speed regime. We have revised the manuscript to explain this objective basis for the comparisons of buildup rates between the two conditions."

We realize that we did not explain this well in the original manuscript, and we have revised the text to clarify this point. With regard to point (2), one of the main reasons that response averages are not straight is the attrition of the trials with more extreme buildup rates from the averages. Comparison of the responses at a particular point in time would suffer from the concerns described above; greater trial attrition in the high speed regime compared to the high accuracy regime at matched times. All of these concerns prompted us to improve (and clarify) the interval chosen for analyses, which is based on matched trial attrition in the two SA regimes."

Specifically, we show that the bounded accumulation model accounts for the behavioral changes with a large static change in the excursion from baseline to threshold. In contrast, the neural responses exhibit a combination of static and time-dependent components of an evidence-independent signal. However, the reason for this tension is straightforward: in the initial presentation of the model fits to behavioral data, we opted not to include a time-dependent component for the sake of simplicity. We did not intend this to motivate a test of whether a static component alone accounts for the SAT. We view the key finding as the fact that an evidence-independent signal is added to LIP responses to implement the SAT. However, we also acknowledge that this signal can be broken down into its static and time-dependent components. Because some readers may react like the reviewers, and because we wish to retain the simplicity of the fits in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, we now report how well either the static or dynamic components of the excursion can account for the behavioral data.

Indeed, we believe that the distinction between static and dynamic components is artificial: the static component is nothing more than the value of the dynamic signal at t=0. As the reviewers recognize, there is a tradition that emphasizes only stationary (i.e., flat) bounds, but this turns out to have been a misguided application of the sequential probability ratio test to situations where it is not normative;in particular situations like ours when there are a variety of stimulus strengths that are randomly interleaved.
