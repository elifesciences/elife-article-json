Calls often featured precisely timed back-and-forth calling interactions, and, over time, were directed more and more towards their partner than other members of the group. Pairs that performed more of these call exchanges during nesting were more likely than others to lay a clutch of eggs."

Vocal signals are especially important in group-living species, because they can be used to maintain group cohesion and coordinate common activities (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib19\">Fichtel and Manser, 2010</a>), but also to recognise, locate and interact with specific individuals inside such groups (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jouventin et al., 1999a</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1999b</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Aubin and Jouventin, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Balsby et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ter Maat et al., 2014</a>). However, in songbirds, most vocalisation studies have focused on male song and its relationship with hormones and reproduction (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nottebohm et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Perez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gahr, 2014</a>) in solitary, territorial, temperate-zone species (<a href=\"#bib26\">Marler, 2004</a>). But songbirds also produce calls in a variety of contexts (<a href=\"#bib26\">Marler, 2004</a>), sometimes in very large numbers throughout the day (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beckers and Gahr, 2010</a>). The usage and function of such calls is still unknown, mainly because it has been challenging to investigate with individual-level resolution naturally occurring vocal interactions between group members, in relevant contexts or different life-history stages."

In this species, both sexes produce diverse calls in large numbers, in various social contexts (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zann, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Beckers and Gahr, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ter Maat et al., 2014</a>), and depending on group structure (<a href=\"#bib17\">Elie et al., 2011</a>). Some soft calls, that is, low-amplitude vocalisations used in close-range signalling (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dabelsteen et al., 1998</a>), have been suggested to play a role in pair communication (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zann, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Elie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ter Maat et al., 2014</a>). However, until recently, it was not possible to record and reliably assign all calls of individual zebra finches in the presence of their mates and within a group (<a href=\"#bib17\">Elie et al., 2011</a>). Because calls are short and may be low in amplitude, especially when used at close range, earlier studies often resorted to strongly reduced social contexts or impoverished environments to investigate vocalisations at the individual level (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blaich et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vignal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anisimov et al., 2014</a>). Hence, these studies mainly addressed mechanistic questions of vocal behaviour, but to understand the underlying meaning of calling, individual-based information in a socially relevant context is necessary."

We aimed at studying the dynamics of different call types and their usage\u2014on the individual level as well as in interactions between mates and other group members\u2014in relation to reproductive state and successful egg-laying. To do this, we housed groups of four females and four males previously unknown to each other together in large aviaries for about 3 weeks, provided them with nest material, and continuously recorded individual vocalisations of all group-members using microphone telemetry (= on-bird microphone transmitters). While the birds formed pairs and passed through different stages of their breeding cycle, we recorded vocalisations, performed behavioural observations, took blood samples for hormone determination, and monitored their nests to measure reproductive performance."

Same capital letters indicate members of a pair, and within-pair interactions can be found in the diagonal from top left to bottom right. Note an increase in within-pair interactions and a decrease in overall group interactions with progressing reproductive stages (left to right). Inserts in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> (lower right corner) explain the different interaction levels in the group (highlighted in pale blue) and the call-type interactions (highlighted in pale yellow).

The birds were not entirely synchronized in their reproductive stages and some nest building began even before actual nest material was provided (using scraps of food or single threads from backpack material). But the addition of proper nest material triggered nesting activities in all birds but one, resulting in a mean onset of nest building at 7.3 \u00b1 2.4 days. Two categories of reproductive status, \u2018nest stage\u2019 and the more detailed \u2018breeding stage\u2019 resulted from our behavioural observations and nest checks (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and are depicted in an overview of reproductive activity over the first 20 days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Hereby, \u2018nest stage\u2019 reflected large-scale changes of reproductive stages and was confirmed by correlated changes in sex steroid levels (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). Zebra finches reproduce as soon as environmental conditions permit to ensure successful breeding (see \u2018Discussion\u2019).

Instead, in many cases, the calling behaviour of a specific bird elicited significant changes in the calling behaviour of another bird within a time frame of 0.5 s (relative to each dyad's baseline). The resulting correlation indices (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for calculation and sample sizes) were plotted in confusion matrices showing all possible combinations of birds and call types (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These matrices demonstrated dynamic interaction patterns between the birds: while birds shared many \u2018significant interactions\u2019 with other birds in various call types at the beginning of the group trial, interactions decreased and became more and more specific with progressing reproductive activities (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

Same-call interactions (bottom left to top right diagonal in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) were not more common than interactions between different call types. However, same-call interactions were more symmetrical between females and males, and changed over the breeding stages almost in the same way for both sexes. In contrast, different call-type interactions were less symmetrical between the sexes. For example, tets were more likely to be answered by stacks when the responding bird was a female, and stacks were more likely to be answered by tets or cackles when the responding bird was a male, especially at the onset of nesting activities (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In this case, the asymmetries thus changed over the breeding stages, with a peak at \u2018nest inspection\u2019. Breeding stage thus had an effect on different call-type combinations."

This means that pairs involving in more call-type interactions at certain stages were more likely to produce a clutch of eggs. Successful pairs only shared significant interactions in few call-type combinations before nesting (1.4 \u00b1 0.83 call-type combinations \u00b1SD) and increased these interactions during the later nest stage (8.92 \u00b1 4.41).

However, the usage and function of call repertoires, especially in group-living species, has been unknown, so far. The zebra finch is one of the prime model organisms for studies on vocal communication, especially with regard to song. Its vocal repertoire, including song and different call types, has been described in most detail by Zann's laboratory and field observations (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zann, 1996</a>) to which we found various parallels in our data. For example, as suggested (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zann, 1996</a>), loud distance calls occurred most before birds were paired or nesting, and cackles and whines increased at the onset of breeding activities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, in most previous analyses of zebra finch vocal behaviour, technical limitations constrained a reliable separation between individual sound sources when birds behaved in social contexts involving direct contact with multiple individuals (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zann, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Elie et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2011</a>). This was especially relevant when birds vocalised quietly and in close proximity to each other (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elie et al., 2010</a>). Although it has been suggested that the vocal output of entire zebra finch groups depends on group structure (<a href=\"#bib17\">Elie et al., 2011</a>) and that quiet calls may play a role in pair formation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zann, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Elie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ter Maat et al., 2014</a>), these previous studies did not investigate calling interactions inside groups with individual-level resolution. For instance, it had been stated that quiet tet calls are produced almost at all times, are not directed at specific individuals, and therefore do not stimulate specific replies (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zann, 1996</a>). Instead, we found that tet calls did not occur randomly, but in meaningful interactions between individual birds."

                                "text": "Zebra finches are opportunistic breeders, and in arid habitats, they rely on short and unpredictable periods of rainfall to successfully rear their young. Therefore, birds need to start breeding immediately when environmental conditions permit (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zann et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Prior et al., 2013</a>), and may do so throughout the year, in the wild as well as in captivity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zann, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Perfito et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Perfito, 2010</a>). In our study, newly joined birds quickly formed pairs and increasingly engaged in reproductive activities which were correlated with increased concentrations of gonadal hormones (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). In parallel, shifts in reproductive stages were associated with changes in calling behaviour. First of all, at the individual level, the call repertoire changed, sometimes showing sex-specific patterns. Second, vocal networks were dynamic, and showed increasing differences between pair and group communication. The most synchronous and therefore most apparent changes in reproductive stages occurred at the sudden onset of nest material which was accompanied by nesting behaviours in most birds and was reflected by a pair-specific pattern lighting up in the vocal interaction matrices. Intriguingly, the quality of within-pair vocal interactions was associated with successful egg-laying. Although all pairs engaged in nesting behaviours at some point, those sharing interactions in more call types during later nest stages were more likely to succeed in producing a clutch of eggs during the 3-week trials. In addition, the different levels of variation, especially before the onset of breeding activities (pre-nesting), suggest that successful pairs were more specific in their call-type usage in interactions, demonstrating the importance of call types in pair communication during the breeding cycle. Because in the wild, birds need to start breeding immediately with the unpredictable onset of rain (see above), such rapid changes in fine-tuned pair communication could be essential for successful reproduction. Our findings thus offer an additional aspect of opportunistic breeding behaviour by showing that changes in the environment, leading to changes in reproductive state, were accompanied by transient changes in the calling behaviour inside groups, involving a shift towards dyadic pair communication."

Our findings not only support that calls and calling interactions between mates are important for pair formation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ter Maat et al., 2014</a>), but also suggest an important role for successful reproduction (egg-laying). In this species, song is produced only by males, and thus constitutes a unilateral signal. Calls, on the other hand, are produced by both sexes and can be exchanged bilaterally. Therefore, they have the potential to be used in mutual and more complex behavioural interactions supporting pair formation and synchronisation as well as pair-bond maintenance, as suggested for other mutual behavioural displays (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib11\">Bradbury and Vehrencamp, 2011</a>). Hereby, some call types are used more frequently in vocal interactions than others. We therefore suggest that for rapid calling exchanges especially the soft and short tet, stack, and cackle calls may be more suitable than longer and more variable calls, such as whines."

Due to large differences in the temporal resolution of sampling methods for hormones and behaviour, a direct comparison between concentrations of circulating hormones and of call communication is difficult (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a> for a more detailed discussion of hormones and calling dynamics in groups). Next to hormones, the decision of an initiating bird to produce a certain call and of a responding bird to answer with a certain call may depend on the specific context, on the behaviour of the other group members, or on the responder's previous experience (as suggested for social bonding in other bird species; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vignal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Emery et al., 2007</a>). To date, we can only speculate on how such vocal interaction patterns are established in this songbird species. Learning might play a role in females and males, because both sexes initiated calling interactions and responded to calls in an increasingly synchronised pattern during progressing reproductive stages. Also, it remains to be investigated whether call-type usage between potential mates supports assortative mating (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moravec et al., 2006</a>), or has a direct effect on fertility, as suggested for specific vocalisations in budgerigars (<i>Melopsittacus undulatus</i>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brockway, 1965</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">1967</a>). Physiological and behavioural synchronisation of pair members have been suggested to play an important role in successful reproduction (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wickler and Seibt, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cheng, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hirschenhauser et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ouyang et al., 2014</a>). To our knowledge, ours is the first study to demonstrate an association between intra-pair calling dynamics and successful egg-laying, thus highlighting the potential fitness relevance of calls and calling interactions in communication systems."

This provided a number of practical advantages in this setting, compared to using loggers (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anisimov et al., 2014</a>), some of which we explain in the following. Due to the unified external recording process when using transmitters (see below), it was possible to gain recordings from all individuals simultaneously and in temporal synchrony (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) within each group. Thus, birds could be housed in a relatively large three-dimensional environment (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2.5 metres) including nest boxes and perches at different heights (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), because transmitters do not require synchronisation to an external, for example, visual signal (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anisimov et al., 2014</a>). In addition, our devices\u2014containing a miniature microphone, a radio transmitter and a button cell battery\u2014were light (1 g), and batteries were replaced only after 6\u201310 days, which strongly reduced the amount of disturbances associated with bird handling, compared to previous studies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib44\">Vignal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anisimov et al., 2014</a>)."

However, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ter Maat et al., 2014</a>), directing the miniature microphone towards the bird's body, that is, facing inwards (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) instead of facing outwards, strongly reduces the probability of recording vocalisations of non-focal individuals, because microphones are attached as closely as possible to the sound source, and external sounds are dampened by the backpack. In addition, due to differences in spectral properties (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>; also see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section on sound analyses), any (rarely) recorded non-focal birds' calls were easily detected and excluded during the sound analyses."

As this procedure tended to decrease radio signal strength, it was not done for males who exhibited normal copulation behaviour despite a protruding antenna. Eight communications receivers (AR8600, AOR, USA) set up outside the aviary were connected to the eight antennas inside the aviary and received the respective AM-modulated radio signals (transmission frequency: 375\u2013380 mHz) coming from the microphone transmitters on the backs of the eight birds. A 16-channel AD-converter (Sonic Core A16 Ultra) was used to digitise the analogous signals. Using a custom multi-channel programme (ASIO Rec, Markus Abels, MPIO Seewiesen), we recorded all eight channels at a rate of 44,100 Hz and stored them as uncompressed files (.wav) on a single computer to ensure temporal synchrony between them. Recordings were automatically started and stopped for all eight birds simultaneously and were made for at least 4 hr in the mornings and evenings every day. An exemplary subset of the recordings was analysed for this manuscript (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 on sound analyses)."

Six (trial I) or seven (trials II and III) sound files per trial were chosen post hoc according to the following rationale for analysis: The respective recordings were started within 2 hr of lights on, and continued for a maximum of 4 hr (i.e., finished before birds' midday). To minimise any external effects on the vocalisations, sound files qualifying for analysis also preceded any major disturbances (e.g., nest checks or blood sampling, see below and <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). Because breeding stages were not synchronous between birds and groups, sound files were chosen for analysis so as to give a relatively balanced representation of all pairs' breeding stages. In total, we analysed 146 sound files (67 for males, 79 for females) coming from up to 10 male and 12 female zebra finches (10 pairs) in the three different trials, summing up to about 535 hr of sound recordings."

To remove low frequency noise, for example, originating from external technical equipment, we used a high-pass filter (200 Hz cut-off frequency; apple Audio Unit) in Amadeus Pro (2.0.5, HairerSoft, UK) on all recordings. We used custom programs (available at <a href=\"https://github.com/ornith\">https://github.com/ornith</a>) to detect, extract and time-stamp sound events, to identify and remove noise (e.g., wing-flapping or noise from degraded radio signal) and non-focals' vocalisations, to automatically define onset and offset of syllables, and to classify them via a k-means clustering paradigm (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ter Maat et al., 2014</a>). During this procedure, the (rare) vocalisations that had been recorded from non-focal individuals were easily detected and removed, because they show less power in the low frequencies, compared to the focal birds' recordings (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). If a syllable's start or end had been defined inaccurately (e.g., due to overlapping noise) and its type was therefore not identifiable or its actual onset did not coincide with the onset of the noisy interval, it was manually deleted. Thus, we retained as many syllables as possible for the analysis but reduced potential confounding artefacts in the temporal information of syllable onsets. As zebra finch males may incorporate some of their calls into their song (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zann, 1996</a>), we arranged all syllables in their order of occurrence before clustering and were thus able to separate similar vocalisation types used in song bouts from those occurring as single calls. The program compares each sonogram in an automatic process with respect to the following nine temporal\u2013spectral parameters: duration, mean frequency and standard deviation (SD), mode frequency and SD, Wiener entropy and SD, first peak and SD. The output was manually refined by visual inspection of the spectrograms so as to reach a classification of different call types according to the descriptions in <a href=\"#bib49\">Zann (1996)</a>. As is described there, cackles, arcs, and whines are associated with the onset of nesting activities and might blend into each other\u2014with cackles being the shortest and the most inflected ones and whines the longest and the least frequency-modulated versions. Arcs lie in between these two types in terms of occurrence, duration, and frequency modulation. Therefore, we decided to use only the calls at the ends of the continuum, namely \u2018cackles\u2019 and \u2018whines\u2019 and to discard the \u2018arcs\u2019 from further analyses. If it was not possible to unambiguously assign single calls to a category, they were moved to a different class which was not included in further analyses. As the aim of our study was to investigate the role of calls in zebra finch groups and the clustering paradigm was optimized for calls, we did not include song in our statistical analyses. Instead, we chose \u2018distance calls\u2019, \u2018stacks\u2019, \u2018tets\u2019, \u2018cackles\u2019, and \u2018whines\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) because they were the most frequently used and easily classified call types. We found the same call types for males and females despite potential sex-specific differences in spectral features, as for example in the loud distance calls that contain learned frequency modulations in males but not in females (<a href=\"#bib39\">Simpson and Vicario, 1990</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

As the durations of recordings were not always identical (220 \u00b1 20 min), these values were extrapolated to the longest recording (243 min), to avoid working with fractions. For the overall calling activity, we summed up these extrapolated numbers of vocalisations in the five call types for each bird and recording period. In addition to this absolute measure of call usage, we divided the number of calls per type by the total sum of calls to obtain the relative proportion of a bird's call types for each recording period."

In R, (3.1.1, R Development Core Team) these tables were concatenated and supplemented with information on the respective breeding stages and hormone data. Previous examinations (unpublished data) of spontaneous calling interactions in zebra finch groups revealed that a large proportion of vocalisations occurring within a few seconds of another bird's calls in fact occurred within half a second. As described in <a href=\"#bib42\">Ter Maat et al. (2014)</a>, for each recording period, vocalisation starting points of two birds were aligned to each other in peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) to gain cumulative sums from which a vocal association index can be calculated. We, too, chose a time window of interest of 4 s before and 4 s after call onset for our PSTHs with a binwidth of 50 ms (i.e., 160 bins in total). The number of calls in the first 0.5-s bins (N<sub>base</sub>) served as baseline and those in the 0.5-s bins after call onset (N<sub>response</sub>) as the response. The correlation index of a \u2018response\u2019 for each set of two birds relative to each other was calculated as follows:"

This will be referred to as a non-zero correlation index (see below for statistical analyses). In this way, vocal activity was considered in calculating the strength of significant interactions. For example, a strong positive correlation in a dyad (turquoise square in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) is not a result of high vocal activity, but of accurate timing of vocalisations between two individuals. Likewise, a value of 0 (grey square in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) means that in this particular dyad, the significance criterion was not met (there was no significant vocal interaction), but does not mean that no vocalisations took place. 50 ms after call onset were removed from the analyses to avoid crosstalk (i.e., in case the same birds had been recorded by both backpacks). Data were considered valid only if each bin contained on average one or more events (i.e., total &gt;160 events)."

An information theoretic approach was used to analyse the relationship between pair call-type combinations and successful egg-laying (see below). As frequentist analyses do not allow an exact calculation of the degrees of freedom (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bolker et al., 2009</a>), we chose a Bayesian statistical approach (with uninformed priors). This allows drawing inferences as meaningful differences between groups by evaluating the ranges of their 95% credible intervals (CrI, range of group means, at 0.95 certainty). Thus, we ran linear mixed-effects models (lmer) using the R package \u2018arm\u2019 (version 1.7\u201305) on the different dependent variables, with bird identity as a random factor."

To be able to compare successful and unsuccessful pairs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we only included breeding stages before the egg-laying phase, that is, until \u2018nest building\u2019, as \u2018egg-laying\u2019 and \u2018incubation\u2019, by definition, only occurred in \u2018successful\u2019 pairs.

For males, there were no differences in DHT concentrations between baseline and pre-nesting, or between early and late nest stages.

These were correlated with increased concentrations of plasma testosterone in females and of androgens (DHT and testosterone) in males. Our results are thus in line with studies showing that changes in the social and abiotic environment\u2014for example the presence of receptive females or of nest material\u2014are reflected by changes in plasma testosterone levels and the emergence of mating behaviours (<a href=\"#bib37\">Riters and Alger, 2011</a>). In addition, progesterone, associated with pair-bonding (<a href=\"#bib40\">Smiley et al., 2012</a>) and reproductive behaviours in females, has been shown to be elevated especially around the egg-laying phase (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wingfield and Farner, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sockman and Schwabl, 1999</a>), further corroborating our results. Whether the differences in calling behaviour over the changing reproductive stages reflect direct effects of gonadal hormones remains to be explored. Androgens are known to affect the abundance of vocalisations of many vertebrate taxa (review in <a href=\"#bib7\">Bass and Remage-Healey, 2008</a>), and in our study, changes in male androgen levels paralleled changes in particular call types across reproductive stages (decreasing distance calls and increasing cackles and whines). In females, there were no similar patterns in gonadal hormones and call usage, as only progesterone increased during the later breeding stage. Therefore, if gonadal hormones affected call usage in females and males, sex-specific hormonal profiles would mediate such dynamics. It is possible that gonadal hormones affected auditory preferences or auditory\u2013motor interfaces, leading to a change in call usage via changed neural responsiveness (<a href=\"#bib27\">Metzdorf et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Avey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Remage-Healey et al., 2010</a>). However, it is unlikely that the slowly fluctuating gonadal hormones determine the closely timed vocal interactions. Rather, they may accompany changes in reproductive states at a larger temporal scale. Unfortunately, a direct comparison between concentrations of circulating hormones and of call communication cannot yet be drawn, due to extreme differences in the temporal resolution of reliable sampling methods available to date for hormonal data and for behavioural and acoustic information. Nevertheless, our findings show that hormones were correlated with changes in reproductive stages, which, in turn, were correlated with calling behaviour on various levels."

Here, we found an interaction between sex and breeding stage for all vocalisation types except for distance calls (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In males, tets occurred at intermediate levels during the \u2018unpaired\u2019 and \u2018no nest\u2019 stages, reached a peak during \u2018nest inspection\u2019 and then decreased again (F<sub>stage</sub> = 5.36, <math id=\"inf31\"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>R</mtext><mrow><mtext>marginal</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> = 0.22, <math id=\"inf32\"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>R</mtext><mrow><mtext>conditional</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> = 0.39).

These conclusions, however, are based on the undefended supposition that the microphones mounted on each bird record only vocalizations generated by that bird alone. However, Anisimov et al. (2014; <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3114\">doi:10.1038/nmeth.3114</a>), utilized telemetric microphone recordings in addition to accelerometer recordings mounted on individual birds and find that the accelerometer, not the microphone, reliably isolated vocalizations from individual birds. Steps need to be taken to defend the premise that the individual-level changes are truly generated by one bird and do not reflect simple changes in proximity to other birds, which are likely to change throughout the course of the experiment. This is an important point as this is what gives the paper its novelty. Providing a histogram of average syllable power recorded from each microphone would allow a clearer rejection of the non-self-generated signal. These histograms would ideally reflect a clear bimodal distribution and would allow the authors to more clearly assert their claims."

For example, one interpretation in the subsection \u201cStudy design, housing and nest material\u201d is that pairs were separated after they formed and that the animals were held in single-sex aviaries to get used to the telemetric backpacks. This is unlikely, since the separation of pair mates is a significant stressor. Alternatively, if the authors intended information on the study set-up to appear prior to the information on study group background, that would be in keeping with a logical, chronological order of the study. Similarly, it is not until later in the section that we learn that the acoustic recordings were not continuous and were restricted to periods of the day. More detail about the recording time intervals is essential, since circadian factors can influence vocalizations in this and other songbird species."

This indicates that there is a significant frequency filtering by the on-bird microphones and/or potential filtering by the placement of the microphone on the back of the bird (i.e. muffling by feathers/body). This is especially stark when comparing these recordings to Zann's original 1996 work on zebra finch calls. Zann's work clearly shows that calls have significant acoustical energy up to 8-9 kHz that may carry information about call identity/category. This therefore bears significantly on the experimenter/automated assignment of calls recorded by the on-bird microphones to different call categories."

For example, if the on-bird radios are transmitting at low frequencies (i.e. under 22 kHz), this would reduce the quality of the recordings substantially, and may explain some of the frequency filtering noted above."

The current Gill et al. paper is the second that I am aware of. It looks like both studies were started independently. Nevertheless, the authors should acknowledge the similar approach used in Anisomov and compare and contrast with their approach, at least in the Methods section of the Gill et al. paper. The greater advance that the Gill et al. makes is that they performed and learned a lot more about the biology and behavior of the animals than did Anisomov et al. For that reason too, I think this paper is making an advance."

The authors should also note in the paper that it could be possible that the hormone changes don't correlate with the calls even on a short time scale, but could with singing, which they could measure in a follow up study.

Steps need to be taken to defend the premise that the individual-level changes are truly generated by one bird and do not reflect simple changes in proximity to other birds, which are likely to change throughout the course of the experiment. This is an important point as this is what gives the paper its novelty. Providing a histogram of average syllable power recorded from each microphone would allow a clearer rejection of the non-self-generated signal. These histograms would ideally reflect a clear bimodal distribution and would allow the authors to more clearly assert their claims</i>."

This indicates that there is a significant frequency filtering by the on-bird microphones and/or potential filtering by the placement of the microphone on the back of the bird (i.e. muffling by feathers/body). This is especially stark when comparing these recordings to Zann's original 1996 work on zebra finch calls. Zann's work clearly shows that calls have significant acoustical energy up to 8-9 kHz that may carry information about call identity/category.

The current Gill et al. paper is the second that I am aware of. It looks like both studies were started independently. Nevertheless, the authors should acknowledge the similar approach used in Anisomov and compare and contrast with their approach, at least in the Methods section of the Gill et al. paper. The greater advance that the Gill et al. makes is that they performed and learned a lot more about the biology and behavior of the animals than did Anisomov et al. For that reason too, I think this paper is making an advance</i>."

Secondly, birds were handled every morning before the beginning of the sound recordings to exchange logger batteries (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anisimov et al., 2014</a>), which was reduced to once a week in our study. Thirdly, to synchronise loggers (clock drift), the backpacks used by <a href=\"#bib3\">Anisimov et al. (2014)</a> contained infrared sensors that required visual contact with the diode at all times. Apart from adding more weight to the backpacks, this required that the environment in which birds were housed was unstructured and limited to two dimensions. Thus, birds were held in small enclosures (60 x 60 x 50 cm), with perches on the ground (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anisimov et al., 2014</a>), which, despite what authors claim, we believe does not give the birds the opportunity to fly anywhere, and strains the notion of \u201cfreely behaving animals\u201d. Fourthly, in addition to the technological differences, bird \u201cgroups\u201d consisted either of singly housed pairs, or of a maximum of four males (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anisimov et al., 2014</a>).

We do not intend to engage in the ongoing and sometimes fierce discussions about which of these methods is \u201cbetter\u201d. We decided to use Bayesian statistics and an information technological approach because, among other things, drawing inference from mixed models is not possible in the frequentist approach (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bolker et al., 2009</a>). Instead of formulating and rejecting non-meaningful null hypotheses, the Bayesian approach is used to investigate differences in effect sizes which can be evaluated directly and intuitively between all groups, by comparing posterior (i.e. estimated from the model) means and credible intervals.
