Pyrethroid resistant Anopheline mosquitoes are now ubiquitous in Africa, though the public health impact remains unclear, impeding the deployment of more expensive nets. Meta-analyses of bioassay studies and experimental hut trials are used to characterise how pyrethroid resistance changes the efficacy of standard bednets, and those containing the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), and assess its impact on malaria control. New bednets provide substantial personal protection until high levels of resistance, though protection may wane faster against more resistant mosquito populations as nets age. Transmission dynamics models indicate that even low levels of resistance would increase the incidence of malaria due to reduced mosquito mortality and lower overall community protection over the life-time of the net. Switching to PBO bednets could avert up to 0.5 clinical cases per person per year in some resistance scenarios."

Pyrethroid resistant Anopheline mosquitoes are now ubiquitous in Africa, though the public health impact remains unclear, impeding the deployment of more expensive nets. Meta-analyses of bioassay studies and experimental hut trials are used to characterise how pyrethroid resistance changes the efficacy of standard bednets, and those containing the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), and assess its impact on malaria control. New bednets provide substantial personal protection until high levels of resistance, though protection may wane faster against more resistant mosquito populations as nets age. Transmission dynamics models indicate that even low levels of resistance would increase the incidence of malaria due to reduced mosquito mortality and lower overall community protection over the life-time of the net. Switching to PBO bednets could avert up to 0.5 clinical cases per person per year in some resistance scenarios."

Unfortunately, some mosquitoes in Africa are evolving so that they can survive contact with the insecticide currently used on bednets."

To help mitigate the effects of insecticide resistance, scientists are testing new strategies to boost the effects of bednets, such as adding a second chemical that makes the insecticide on bednets more deadly to mosquitoes. In some places, adding this second chemical makes the nets more effective, but in others it does not. Moreover, these doubly treated, or \u201ccombination\u201d, nets are more expensive and so it can be hard for health officials to decide whether and where to use them."

Insecticide-treated bednets provide good protection for individuals sleeping under them until relatively high levels of resistance are achieved, as measured using a simple test. As more resistant mosquitos survive encounters with the nets, the likelihood of being bitten before bed or while sleeping unprotected by a net increases. This is expected to increase malaria infections. As bednets age and are washed multiple times, they lose some of their insecticide and this problem becomes worse."

However, there is a growing realisation that insecticide resistance is putting these advances under threat (<a href=\"#bib68\">WHO, 2012</a>), with mosquitoes reporting widespread resistance to pyrethroids, the only class of insecticides currently approved for use in bednets (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ranson and Lissenden, 2016</a>). The public health impact of pyrethroid resistance in areas of LLIN use is hard to quantify as a\u00a0comparison between sites is complicated by multiple epidemiological factors making it difficult to ascribe differences in malaria metrics solely to mosquito susceptibility (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kleinschmidt et al., 2015</a>). The efficacy of LLINs against mosquitoes is typically measured in experimental hut trials (<a href=\"#bib69\">WHO, 2013a</a>). These experiments are time consuming, relatively expensive, and geographically limited and by themselves they do not fully account for all effects of the LLIN as they do not show the community impact (herd effects) caused by the insecticide killing mosquitoes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Killeen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Magesa et al., 1991</a>). Mathematical models can be used to translate entomological endpoint trial data into predictions of public health impact. Currently this has only been done for a small number of sites (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bri\u00ebt et al., 2013</a>) making it difficult for malaria control programmes to understand the problems caused by insecticide resistance in their epidemiological setting."

The current most practical phenotypic method for assessing resistance is the use of bioassays which take wild mosquitoes and measures their mortality after exposure to a fixed dose of insecticide (<a href=\"#bib69\">WHO, 2013a</a>). However the discriminating doses used in the assay are unrelated to the field exposure and so the predictive value of these bioassays for assessing the problems of pyrethroid resistance is unknown. A meta-analysis has shown that insecticide treated bednets still outperform untreated nets in experimental hut trials even against pyrethroid resistant populations (<a href=\"#bib59\">Strode et al., 2014</a>) though the community impact (herd effects) of the LLIN was not assessed (<a href=\"#bib27\">Killeen et al., 2007</a>). The population prevalence of pyrethroid resistance is known to be changing at a fast rate (<a href=\"#bib61\">To\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>) making it important to regularly re-evaluate the efficacy of LLINs in order to guide current vector control and resistance management strategies (<a href=\"#bib68\">WHO, 2012</a>)."

Until new LLINs containing alternative insecticide are available the only alternative bednet are those containing pyrethroids plus the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Studies have shown that PBO LLINs are substantially better at killing insecticide resistant mosquitoes in some locations but not others (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ngufor et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kitau et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Asale et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ngufor et al., 2014c</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koudou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Corbel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tungu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Malima et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Adeogun et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Agossa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Malima et al., 2013</a>). PBO LLINs are more expensive than standard LLINs, with one manufacturer\u2019s 2012 price for PBO LLIN being US$4.90 compared to a comparable standard LLIN price of US$3.25 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bri\u00ebt et al., 2013</a>). This makes it unclear where and when their use would be beneficial over standard LLINs given constrained public health budgets. A mathematical modelling study used results from 6 experimental hut trials comparing a standard LLIN (PermaNet 2.0) with a PBO LLIN (PermaNet 3.0) against <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu lato mosquitoes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bri\u00ebt et al., 2013</a>). It predicted that the more expensive PBO LLIN was still cost effective compared to a threshold of US$150/DALY averted (not comparing against standard LLINs) in 4 of the 6 sites, though these results are not generalisable beyond the specific sites chosen by the manufacturer, population prevalence of resistance, the type of LLIN or mosquito species. The WHO has recognised the increased bio-efficacy of PermaNet 3.0 in some areas (<a href=\"#bib71\">WHO, 2015</a>) but there is a lack of clear consensus on when and where these should be deployed. Defining the added public health benefit expected by a switch to PBO LLINs is essential to guide decisions on pricing, purchasing and deployment."

Firstly (1) a meta-analysis and statistical model are used to determine whether mosquito mortality in a bioassay can be used to predict the proportion of mosquitoes, which die in experimental hut trials and to define the shape of this relationship. Secondly (2), another meta-analysis of experimental hut trial data is analysed to characterise the full impact of pyrethroid resistance on LLIN effectiveness. Thirdly, information from (1) and (2) is used to parameterise a widely used malaria transmission dynamics mathematical model to estimate the public health impact of pyrethroid resistance in different settings taking into account the community impact of LLINs. An illustration of model predictions showing how different malaria metrics change over time is given in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. The figure also indicates how LLIN coverage and variables such as malaria endemicity are incorporated in the model. Finally (4) this model is combined with bioassay and experimental hut trial results to predict the epidemiological impact of switching from mass distribution of standard to PBO LLIN."

It is assumed that the ability of a mosquito to survive insecticide exposure is not associated with any other behavioural or physiological change in the mosquito population which influences malaria transmission.

Since there are currently no published durability studies in areas of high pyrethroid resistance or with PBO LLINs we estimate the loss of insecticidal activity from experimental hut trials using washed nets. Results indicate that washing decreases efficacy fastest in areas of higher pyrethroid resistance. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> shows estimates of the decay in pyrethroid activity assuming that the loss of efficacy due to washing is proportional to the change in activity seen over time (i.e. if the rate of decay over subsequent washes is twice as fast in a resistant mosquito population than the decay of pyrethroid activity over time will also be twice as fast). Mosquitoes with high pyrethroid resistance appear to overcome the insecticide activity of the LLIN faster than susceptible mosquitoes.

This is due to the lower initial killing efficacy of the LLIN but also because of the higher rate of decay of insecticidal activity (it gets less effective more quickly). The absolute increase in EIR caused by resistance increases in areas of high endemicity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), though the model predicts that the number of clinical cases caused will peak at intermediate parasite prevalence because high levels of clinical immunity will mask increased infection rates in hyper-endemic areas. Understandably the impact of resistance will depend on the current LLIN coverage, with the total public health impact of resistance being greatest in areas where bednets were having the highest impact (i.e. areas of lower, 50%, coverage, see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Equally the impact of resistance will be higher in areas with mosquito species which are more amenable to control through the use of LLINs (i.e. greater in <i>Anopheles gambiae sensu\u00a0stricto</i> than <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3</a>). The transmission dynamics model predicts that the public health impact of pyrethroid resistance will be high. For example with as little as 30% resistance (70% mortality in discriminating dose assay) in a population with 10% slide prevalence (in 2\u201310 year olds) the model predicts that pyrethroid resistance would cause an additional 245 (95%CI 142\u2013340) cases per 1000 people per year (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, averaged over the 3 year life-expectancy of the net).

In mosquito populations with moderate to high resistance results indicate PBO is an effective synergist of pyrethroids (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). For example in an area with 10% endemicity and 80% resistance (20% mortality in discriminating dose assay) the model predicts that switching to PBO LLINs would avert an additional 501 (95%CI 319\u2013621) cases per 1000 people per year (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) compared to the same level of standard LLIN coverage. The absolute number of cases averted by switching to PBO LLINs is predicted to be greater in areas with intermediate endemicity as human immunity is likely to partially buffer the added benefit of PBO LLINs in areas of highest malaria prevalence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). However, due to the non-linear relationship between incidence of clinical infection and endemicity, the greatest percentage reduction in clinical cases and EIR is seen in areas of low endemicity (Figure 5CF). The exact change in clinical cases will vary between settings. For example switching from 80% coverage with standard LLINs to 80% coverage with PBO LLINs in an area with 30% endemicity and a mosquito population with 60% pyrethroid resistance is predicted to reduce the number of clinical cases by ~60% whereas the same switch in the type of nets used in an area with 30% endemicity and 20% pyrethroid resistance would only reduce the number of clinical cases by ~20% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Greater percentage reductions are likely to be seen in EIR than the number of clinical cases due to human immunity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

There is a high level of measurement error in the bioassay (as seen by the wide variability in points in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>) so care should be taken when interpreting the results of single assays as differences in mosquito mortality may have been caused by chance. Multiple bioassays could be conducted on the same mosquito population and the results averaged to increase confidence. However the exact cause of the measurement error remains unknown so increased repetition many not necessarily generate substantially more accurate results as possible causes of variability, such as mosquito husbandry techniques or environmental conditions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kleinschmidt et al., 2015</a>), may be repeated. Further work is therefore needed to determine whether assay repetition substantially improves overall accuracy or whether further standardisation or more complex assays are required. The majority of data are for <i>A. gambiae s.l.</i> so the analysis needs to be repeated for other species once data becomes available. More advanced methods of measuring insecticide resistance (such as the intensity bioassay [<a href=\"#bib8\">Bagi et al., 2015</a>] or the use of genetic markers [<a href=\"#bib66\">Weetman and Donnelly, 2015</a>]) are likely to be a more precise way of predicting resistance. However, since there are insufficient data to repeat these analyses with these other assays their predictive ability remains untested. Similarly, this analysis has grouped WHO tube, WHO cone and CDC bottle assays together when the use of a single assay type might be more predictive."

This analysis suggests that the probability that a mosquito will feed on someone beneath an LLIN only increases substantially at high levels of pyrethroid resistance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). People under bednets exposed to mosquito populations with intermediate levels of resistance still have a high degree of personal protection whilst in bed as those mosquitoes, which do not die are likely to exit the hut without feeding. It is only when mosquito populations are highly resistant (&gt;60% survival) that an increasing proportion of mosquitoes appear to successfully feed through the LLIN (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This may explain why a previous meta-analysis on the impact of pyrethroid resistance on LLIN efficacy in experimental hut trials failed to find a substantial effect (<a href=\"#bib59\">Strode et al., 2014</a>) as resistance was categorised into broad groups (partially based on highly variable bioassay data) unlike here where resistance is treated as a continuous variable (as measured using experimental hut trial mortality data which are less variable than bioassay data). This earlier study also only analysed papers published or presented prior to May 2013 and so it did not include the recent experimental hut trials which had the lowest mosquito mortality (<a href=\"#bib60\">To\u00e9, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Pennetier et al., 2013</a>)."

LLIN efficacy is therefore reduced as mosquitos enter huts where they have both a higher chance of feeding and a lower chance of being killed. These parallel changes in behaviour increase the resilience of mosquito populations to LLINs as in a susceptible mosquito population, high deterrence will reduce LLIN efficacy by preventing mosquitoes entering houses where they have a high chance of being killed (relative to susceptible populations). Importantly the loss of deterrence suggests that those sleeping in a house with an LLIN though not sleeping under the net themselves (a phenomenon particularly common in older children [<a href=\"#bib46\">Nankabirwa et al., 2014</a>]) will lose an additional degree of protection (on top of the community impact of mosquito killing)."

Evidence suggests that multiply washed LLINs lose their ability to kill mosquitoes more in areas of high pyrethroid resistance. Washing is seen as an effective method of aging LLINs (<a href=\"#bib69\">WHO, 2013a</a>). Repeatedly washing a net (and presumably reducing the concentration of the insecticide) appears to have little impact on its ability to kill a susceptible mosquito whilst significantly reducing the lethality of the LLIN against more resistant mosquitoes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The difference in mortality is likely to be caused by mosquitoes with a\u00a0higher population prevalence of resistance being able to tolerate a higher concentration of insecticide (<a href=\"#bib69\">WHO, 2013a</a>). If so, then the higher longevity of LLINs against susceptible mosquitoes observed in the washed net data may be explained by the longer time it takes for the insecticide concentration on the LLIN to drop below this critical level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This analysis assumes that the decay in pyrethroid activity over time is proportional to its decay following washing and this needs to be confirmed by durability studies in areas of high pyrethroid resistance. Nevertheless the results seem to be confirmed by two recent studies which evaluated mosquito mortality in older (standard) LLINs (<a href=\"#bib61\">To\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wanjala et al., 2015</a>). Durability studies should be prioritised as the model predicts that, even at low levels of pyrethroid resistance, the loss of insecticide activity over the three year bednet life-expectancy, has a bigger epidemiological impact on malaria, than the initial efficacy of new LLINs. If confirmed then more regular net distribution could be considered as a temporary, albeit expensive, method to mitigate the public health impact of high pyrethroid resistance."

Though a person under an LLIN requires high pyrethroid resistance before LLINs start to fail (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), the models predict that at a population level even low pyrethroid resistance can increase the number of malaria cases over the life-time of the net (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Hut trials measure feeding when the volunteer is underneath a bednet whilst in reality (and in the mathematical model) a percentage of mosquito bites are taken when people are not in bed. The loss of LLIN induced mosquito mortality is likely to decrease the community impact of LLINs, increasing average mosquito age and the likelihood that people are infected whilst unprotected by a bednet. This is primarily due to the shorter duration of insecticide potency of LLINs in mosquito populations with a higher prevalence of resistance (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wanjala et al., 2015</a>). Without this change in the duration of pyrethroid activity, the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid resistance will only become evident once it reaches a high level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The change in the community impact of LLINs can be seen in the increase in the number of cases in people who do not use nets. This change is substantial, reinforcing the need to consider community effects in any policy decision."

These simulations also assume that resistance arrives overnight, when in reality it will spread through a mosquito population more gradually and therefore may be harder to detect. Mosquitoes exposed to LLINs may have reduced fitness (<a href=\"#bib63\">Viana et al., 2016</a>). Currently the model assumes that mosquitoes which survive 24 hr after LLIN exposure are indistinguishable from unexposed mosquitoes. If this is not the case then hut trials data alone will be insufficient to predict the public health impact of pyrethroid resistance as current models will over-estimate its impact. Similarly, if the mosquito population exhibits additional behavioural mechanisms to avoid LLINs, such as earlier biting times, in tandem to the increased tolerance of pyrethroid insecticide then the predictions presented here will likely underestimate the public health impact as this behaviour change has not been incorporated."

Though useful, this entomological measure should not be considered as a measure of the effectiveness of pyrethroid LLINs. The personal protection provided by sleeping under an LLIN is likely to be substantial even at very high levels of resistance (<a href=\"#bib59\">Strode et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Randriamaherijaona et al., 2015</a>). Any reduction in mosquito mortality will likely reduce the community impact of LLINs though it may be hard to detect, especially in areas with new LLINs (the public health impact of resistance is likely to be greater in older nets, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). As with all transmission dynamic mathematical models, these predictions need to be validated in particular locations with well-designed studies combining epidemiological and entomological data. We are currently unaware of any published data with sufficient information to test the model against though a thorough validation exercise should be carried out as soon as such studies become available. Currently the meta-analyses and transmission dynamics models concentrated on malaria in Africa and give predictions for the three primary mosquito vector species found there. Each meta-analyses has data from multiple countries but these sites are not geographically representative of the whole of malaria endemic Africa. Though the principles outlined here may apply to other mosquito species in different care\u00a0settings should be taken when extrapolating the results beyond the areas where the data were collated."

The exact causes of this are unknown but is likely related to the predominant resistance mechanisms in each species. PBO\u2019s primary synergistic effect of pyrethroids is thought to be due to the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes which catalyse the detoxification of the insecticides (<a href=\"#bib22\">Farnahm, 1998</a>). Elevated P450 levels are the primary resistance mechanism in <i>A. funestus</i> whereas in <i>A. gambiae s.l</i>. both increased detoxification and alterations in the target site contribute to pyrethroid resistance with the latter mechanism being largely unaffected by PBO (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mulamba et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Riveron et al., 2013</a>)."

Additional data would also allow the differences between species in the <i>A.\u00a0gambiae</i> complex to be assessed. A previous analysis comparing PermaNet 2.0 and 3.0 was unable to test whether the increase in efficacy of the PBO LLIN was solely due to the addition of PBO as this net has a higher concentration of insecticide (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bri\u00ebt et al., 2013</a>). The results presented here show a consistent pattern between PermaNet 2.0 and 3.0 and Olyset and Olyset Plus.

If there is a\u00a0greater mortality in the PBO bioassay and the relative mortalities broadly agree with the red curve in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, then <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> can be used to predict the approximate number of cases that will be saved by switching from standard to PBO LLINs (for a given level of endemicity and LLIN coverage).

If both net types cost the same and resistance has been detected then this work indicates that PBO LLINs should always be deployed as evidence suggests that they are always more effective. However, if PBO nets are more expensive, then cost effectiveness analysis will be required. The results of such analysis are likely to be context specific (depending on price, resistance level, endemicity and coverage) and interpreting them will require information on decision makers\u2019 willingness and ability to pay for additional effectiveness. In many situations, malaria control budgets are likely to be fixed and therefore switching to more expensive PBO LLINs may cause a reduction in overall bednet coverage. The impact of reduced coverage must therefore be off set against the benefits of introducing PBO nets, taking into consideration any additional factors such as changed programmatic costs, and equity issues."

A large body of evidence has shown how widespread use of LLINs can cause considerable community protection, both to those who use bednets and non-users (Killeen,\u00a02007 and references therein). Therefore the community impact should be considered in any study investigating the consequences of pyrethroid resistance (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bri\u00ebt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Killeen, 2014</a>), as any reduction in mosquito killing is likely to increase malaria cases even in areas with mildly resistant mosquito populations where LLINs are still providing good personal protection. The\u00a0evidence presented here suggests that high levels of pyrethroid resistance are likely to have a bigger public health impact than previously thought and therefore could represent a major threat to malaria control in Africa."

To test whether this relationship changed with the population prevalence of insecticide resistance simple functional forms were fit to the raw data using a mixed-effect logistic regression (summarised as Relationship 1, <i>R1</i>). There has been an attempt to standardise bioassay and experimental hut trial procedures to enable data from different studies to be directly compared. These include using standard concentrations of insecticide, mosquito exposure time and mosquito husbandry in bioassays, hut design, trap type and the use of human baits in experimental hut trials. Nevertheless, some procedural discrepancies remain between studies, for example, in bioassays the age and sex of mosquitoes and how they were collected (e.g. F1 progeny of wild caught mosquitoes or wild caught larvae reared in insectary and tested as adults). These co-variates and others (for example information on genetic markers associated with insecticide resistance), could be included within the analysis, though their addition would increase data needs of future studies and complicate the use of study results. Instead a mixed-effects binomial regression is adopted which allows mosquito mortality to vary at random between studies. This statistical method enables a wider selection of studies to be included within the analysis, produces more generalizable results and reduces problems caused by data autocorrelation. Mosquito mortality in an experimental hut trial is defined as the proportion of mosquitoes, which enter the hut which die, either within the hut or within the next 24 hr."

Instead a meta-analysis of all bioassay data investigating the impact of PBO on pyrethroid induced mosquito mortality is undertaken incorporating all published and unpublished literature (<i>M2,</i> <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Bioassay mortality can be influenced by a multitude of factors including assay type, temperature and relative humidity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kleinschmidt et al., 2015</a>). To account for this difference between studies, the relationship between the benefit of adding PBO and the population prevalence of pyrethroid resistance was estimated using a mixed-effect logistic regression (<i>R2</i>). Preliminary analysis suggests that the shape of the relationship is relatively complex and cannot simply be described by the use of a standard linear function typically used in regression. Since the added benefit of PBO in a given population will ultimately be determined by the shape of this relationship a variety of different functional forms are tested statistically. It was initially intended to include the type of assay used (e.g. WHO tube assay, WHO cone assay or CDC bottle assay) as an additional fixed effect, though the paucity of data (especially comparing bioassay mortality to experimental hut trial mortality) meant that data from all assays were combined and this covariate was excluded. As the same type of assay are used for both non-PBO and PBO tests this should not bias the results and will generate recommendations that are generalizable across all three assay types. The proportion of mosquitoes killed by pyrethroid insecticide in a bioassay with the addition of PBO is denoted <math id=\"inf21\"><mi>f</mi></math> and is given by the equation:"

Restricting the analysis to the two most commonly used standard LLINs minimises the inter-study variability and allows the different behaviours of mosquitoes exposed to standard and PBO LLINs to be directly assessed. Following a widely used transmission dynamics model of malaria (<a href=\"#bib24\">Griffin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Walker et al., 2015</a>) it is assumed that an LLIN can alter a host-seeking mosquito behaviour in one of three ways: firstly it can deter a mosquito from entering a hut (an exito-repellency effect); secondly the mosquito can exit the hut without taking a bloodmeal; and thirdly it could kill a mosquito (with the mosquito either being fed or unfed). A mosquito that isn\u2019t deterred, exited or killed will successfully blood-feed and survive. The public health benefit of LLINs depends not only on their initial effectiveness but also on how the properties of the net changes over its life-time. The ability of a net to kill a mosquito will decrease over time as the quantity of insecticide active ingredient declines. The non-lethal protection provided by the LLIN may also decrease with the decay of the active ingredient and the physical degradation of the net (i.e. the acquisition of holes). It is assumed that the underlying difference in hut trial mortality between sites for standard LLINs is caused by the mosquito population having a different population prevalence of pyrethroid resistance. Pyrethroid resistance may also influence the relative strength of LLIN deterrence and exiting and it is important to characterise these modifications of behaviour as they contribute substantially to the population level impact of mass LLIN distribution. Visual inspection of these data indicates that mosquito deterrence and exiting can be described by the degree of mosquito mortality seen in the same hut trial."

The non-lethal protection provided by the LLIN may also decrease with the decay of the active ingredient and the physical degradation of the net (i.e. the acquisition of holes). To fully capture the loss of efficacy of an LLIN requires a net durability survey to be carried out over multiple years. To our knowledge, no durability studies have been published in areas of high pyrethroid resistance nor using the new generation of LLINs with the addition of PBO. In the absence of these data, we use the results from experimental hut trials that washed the net prior to its use. These experimental huts give some indication of how mosquitoes react to the change in insecticide concentration, though they do not provide information on the physical durability of the net (as holes in the net are artificially generated). For simplicity and following (<a href=\"#bib24\">Griffin et al., 2010</a>) it is assumed that the killing activity of pyrethroid over time (the half-life in years, denoted <math id=\"inf127\"><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>y</mi></msub></mrow></math>) is proportional to the loss of morbidity caused by washing (the half-life in washes, <math id=\"inf128\"><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>w</mi></msub></mrow></math>).

This Bayesian method enabled measurement error to be incorporated in both the dependent and independent variables according to the number of mosquitoes sampled (both in bioassays and hut trials). Uninformative priors were used for all parameters with the exception of the random effects variance parameters which were constrained to be positive (though were still uninformative,see <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Source code 1</a> in the Supplementary Information for a full list of priors). Three Markov chains were initialized to assess convergence and the first 5000 Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations were discarded as burn in. Convergence was assessed visually and a total of 10,000 iterations were used to derive the posterior distribution for all parameters and to generate 95% Bayesian credible interval estimates for model fits. The models were compared using the deviance information criterion (DIC) where the smaller value indicates a better fit, and a difference of five deviance information criterion units is considered to be substantial (<a href=\"#bib58\">Spiegelhalter et al., 2002</a>). <a href=\"#equ8\">Equations [8] to [19]</a> were fit simultaneously to <i>M3</i> enable the impact of washed nets to contribute to the relationship between <math id=\"inf146\"><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math>, <math id=\"inf147\"><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf148\"><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math>, through the decay function, <math id=\"inf149\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math>, doubling the number of datapoints in the analysis.

                                "text": "The public health benefit of PBO-LLINs will depend on the epidemiological setting in which they are deployed. This includes the baseline characteristics of the setting (e.g. mosquito species, abundance and seasonality), history of malaria control interventions (e.g. prior use of bednets, management of clinical cases) and prevalence of insecticide resistance. The rate at which pyrethroid resistance has evolved is highly uncertain. It is likely that it first became evident through its use in agriculture and the relative contribution of vector control to the selection of resistance is unknown and will vary between sites. This makes it impossible to recreate the spread of resistant phenotypes in a particular setting and predict its cumulative public health impact without detailed longitudinal studies spanning decades (which do not exist for malaria endemic regions). Instead the impact of pyrethroid resistance is estimated by assuming it arrives instantaneously at a given level. To generate a broadly realistic history of LLIN usage it is assumed that LLINs were introduced at a defined coverage at year zero and redistributed every three years to the same percentage of the human population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The mosquito population is assumed to be either <i>A. gambiae</i> s.s., <i>A. arabiensis</i> or <i>Anopheles funestus</i> (the three major vectors in Africa) which are entirely susceptible to pyrethroids up until year 6 when pyrethroid resistance arrives instantaneously. The public health impact of resistance is then measured over the subsequent three years (the average clinical incidence or entomological inoculation rate (EIR) between the\u00a0years 6 and 9) and compared to a population where resistance did not arise. The impact of PBO LLINs is predicted by introducing them into the resistant population at the\u00a0year 9 and then measuring over the subsequent 3 years. For simplicity, it is assumed that there is perennial transmission, no other type of vector control and that once introduced pyrethroid resistance remains constant. Though perennial transmission is unrealistic it is necessary in order to produce simple guidelines (as there is a very high number of combinations of seasonal patterns, relative mosquito species abundance and timings of LLIN distribution campaigns). A sensitivity analysis with more realistic seasonal patterns shows the change in clinical incidence compared to the perennial transmission is relatively minor, in part because the LLINs are used over 3 yearly cycles and their decay in effectiveness is relatively slow. LLINs are initially distributed at time zero at random (i.e. there was no targeting to those with the highest infection) and from then on the same people receive them every campaign to ensure that coverage remains at the defined level (i.e. the number of people with an LLIN would go up if the\u00a0distribution was random each round). Realistic usage patterns are adopted to reflect higher coverage immediately after LLIN distribution. No other vector control is incorporated whilst 35% of clinical cases are assumed to receive treatment, 36% which receive an ACT (estimated by averaging across Africa using data collated by <a href=\"#bib16\">Cohen et al., [2012]</a>). A full list of the parameters, their definitions and estimated values are given in <a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a> whilst all other parameters are taken from <a href=\"#bib24\">Griffin et al.

The methods are also well-described (though will be even clearer once code has been made available as is planned). There is one area that I think needs to be improved: while the methods describe clearly what was done, it is not always clear why. In particular, I found the reasons behind a number of modelling choices described in the subsections \u201cQuantifying the impact of standard and PBO LLINs in the presence of insecticide resistance\u201d and \u201cParameterising transmission dynamics model\u201d opaque. For example, why use a 3rd order polynomial when looking at LLIN deterrence? Are there reasons for thinking there should be two change-points? To what extent are the assumptions of normally distributed errors (<a href=\"#equ9\">Equation 9</a>) justified? Can the data motivating the choice of <a href=\"#equ10\">Equations 10\u201311</a> be shown in a technical appendix? Motivation of <a href=\"#equ12\">Equations 12\u201314</a> is also lacking: taking the simplest (<a href=\"#equ13\">Equation 13</a>) it is unclear why s_p0 (the proportion of mosquitoes feeding successfully) should depend on both m_p (the ratio of the number of mosquitoes entering a hut with a LLIN to the number entering a hut without a bednet), and on k_p (the proportion which enter and successfully feed a p-treated hut), given that the latter already includes entering. Moreover, it is claimed that s_p0 is a proportion, so should be constrained between 0 and 1, but if m_p = 1 (so bednets have no effect on entering) then s_p0=k_p/k_0, which is a ratio of two proportions rather than a proportion itself (for plausible parameters values it presumably will be below 1, but it is not necessarily so). I therefore think further motivation is required, which should ideally include some graphical assessments of model assumptions (3rd order polynomial, normally distributed errors, relationship between k_p and mortality) which could go in the appendix."
