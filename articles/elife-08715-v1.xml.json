The movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus is called chemotaxis, and Fraenkel and Gunn proposed that animals that are attracted to a chemical will move in straight lines, and stop whenever the concentration of the chemical decreases. The animals will then turn and start a new \u2018run\u2019 in a different direction. In relatively still water or air, this strategy will lead the organism up the chemical gradient and towards the source.

For example, when the light simulated the receptor for an attractive odor (such as those typically given off by ripe fruit), the larvae often turned after a decrease in light levels (which resembles a decrease in the odor's concentration). Moreover, when light levels increased, larvae stopped turning and started a new run. The results for repulsive odors (and bitter tastes) show the opposite pattern. Thus, the experimental and computational paradigm established by Hernandez-Nunez et al. could in the future be used to determine whether stimuli are attractive or aversive, and also to quantitatively describe the decision-making process during chemotaxis."

Again, chemosensory neurons are activated with light (specifically red light) via optogenetics. However, blue light is also used to activate the larvae's photoreceptors. In general, fruit fly larvae avoid light, and although they are sensitive to blue light, they usually cannot detect red light. This means that the blue light is always aversive, while the red light can be attractive or aversive, depending on which sensory neurons are activated."

A decrease in blue light intensity has the opposite effect, and the larvae tend to continue to \u2018run\u2019 forwards. Using optogenetics and red light to activate chemosensory neurons that normally detect repulsive odors or chemicals (for example, carbon dioxide) triggered similar responses (middle).

Instead, larvae follow their aversion to light or their attraction to an odor by whatever stimulus is changing favorably at that point in time. This indicates that the same neural circuit integrates odor and light stimuli, and that it lies upstream of the motor commands that control movements."

This model supports the hypothesis that it becomes more likely that a larva will turn when there is a sharp drop in OSN activity.

They all combine this with quantitative measures of behavior and modeling to address the mechanisms that underlie how animals orient toward attractive stimuli (and away from repulsive stimuli), and show how the animals negotiate shifting stimulus landscapes. Fraenkel and Gunn would be proud to see how their behavioral observations and insights have led to hypotheses about the underlying neuronal control that can be mechanistically tested. Fly larvae act as stochastic problem-solving machines, turning whenever they lose the scent, and ultimately arriving at its source."
