We show here that endogenous p21, instead of being residual, it is functional and necessary to preserve the genomic stability of unstressed cells. p21depletion slows down nascent DNA elongation, triggers permanent replication defects and promotes the instability of hard-to-replicate genomic regions, namely common fragile sites (CFS). The p21\u2019s PCNA interacting region (PIR), and not its CDK binding domain, is needed to prevent the replication defects and the genomic instability caused by p21 depletion. The alternative polymerase kappa is accountable for such defects as they were not observed after simultaneous depletion of both p21 and polymerase kappa. Hence, in CDK-independent manner, endogenous p21 prevents a type of genomic instability which is not triggered by endogenous DNA lesions but by a dysregulation in the DNA polymerase choice during genomic DNA synthesis."

We show here that endogenous p21, instead of being residual, it is functional and necessary to preserve the genomic stability of unstressed cells. p21depletion slows down nascent DNA elongation, triggers permanent replication defects and promotes the instability of hard-to-replicate genomic regions, namely common fragile sites (CFS). The p21\u2019s PCNA interacting region (PIR), and not its CDK binding domain, is needed to prevent the replication defects and the genomic instability caused by p21 depletion. The alternative polymerase kappa is accountable for such defects as they were not observed after simultaneous depletion of both p21 and polymerase kappa. Hence, in CDK-independent manner, endogenous p21 prevents a type of genomic instability which is not triggered by endogenous DNA lesions but by a dysregulation in the DNA polymerase choice during genomic DNA synthesis."

We have previously shown that p21 downregulation after UV facilitates nascent DNA elongation across UV-damaged DNA templates by enabling the recruitment of alternative (alt) DNA pols to replication factories (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mansilla et al., 2013</a>). Strikingly, UV irradiation couples translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) by alt DNA pols with the activation of the CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> E3 ligase at replisomes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Havens and Walter, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Nishitani et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</a>).

In conclusion, the degradation of endogenous p21 at replication sites in S phase allows full TLS activation or fork-restart when required."

Here we report that endogenous p21 localizes at replication factories through PCNA binding, thereby avoiding DNA polymerase \u03ba (Pol \u03ba) to be recruited at replication factories. Surprisingly, in contradiction with its function as a negative regulator of CDKs, p21 facilitates S phase progression; that\u00a0is p21 promotes nascent DNA elongation.The DNA replication defects caused by p21-depletion caused accumulation of replication stress markers, such as \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1, instability of common fragile sites and micronuclei (MN) accumulation. Interestingly, all the replication defects observed in p21-depleted cells were eliminated when Pol \u03ba was depleted, and were also complemented by a p21 mutant with an intact PCNA binding domain and a disrupted CDK binding site. Collectively, our data demonstrate that, although expressed at low levels in S phase, p21 fine-tunes the dynamics of DNA replication by regulating Pol \u03ba loading to replisomes. Therefore, while the CDKs/p21 interaction is crucial to the cellular response to DNA damage, the PCNA/p21 interaction prevents the accumulation of DNA-damage independent genomic instability in unstressed cycling cells."

Indeed, p21 levels in cycling cells are not null and can be detected on EdU positive cells with p21 specific antibodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>) as reported recently (<a href=\"#bib18\">Coleman et al., 2015</a>). Remarkably, while p21 levels are at the lowest in S phase (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), they are sufficient to impair TLS-dependent DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mansilla et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</a>) if not degraded after UV irradiation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A, B</a>). Notably, the function of p21 during unperturbed cell cycle progression remained unknown. A hint of such function was revealed by a Proximity ligation assay (PLA) which revealed a chromatin bound PCNA/p21 interaction in cycling cells. Such complexes resisted a mild extraction with CSK buffer which removes proteins unbound to chromatin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). Consistent with our previous findings, the percentage of cells with PLA spots was reduced by UV irradiation and PLA spots were not detected upon p21 depletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). In agreement, endogenous p21 colocalized with PCNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and F</a>) and EdU-labelled replication factories (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The colocalization of p21 and GFP-PCNA became more evident following removal of proteins unbound to chromatin (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We next evaluated the requirement of the p21 PIR region for p21-PCNA colocalization. To this end, we transfected cells with either p21 or p21<sup>PIPMut*</sup>, bearing an intact or a disrupted PIR, respectively (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mansilla et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Soria et al., 2008</a>). The disruption of the CDK-binding site by point mutations in both constructs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mansilla et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Soria et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2008</a>), prevented the arrest outside S phase expected after p21 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). Similar to endogenous p21, overexpressed p21 localized to replication factories (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). However, p21<sup>PIPMut*\u00a0</sup>lost its ability to form foci at replication factories (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), did not colocalize with PCNA (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>) and showed reduced chromatin retention (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D and E</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we used p21-depleted U2OS osteosarcoma cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The number of cells positive for EdU and with PCNA bound to chromatin increased after p21 depletion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). An enrichment in PCNA focal distribution corresponding to mid-to-late S phase (<a href=\"#bib22\">Essers et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rey et al., 2009</a>), was found in p21-depleted samples (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) which suggested a defect intrinsic to S phase and independent from the G1/S transition."

Nascent DNA was labelled with a 10-min pulse of CldU (Chlorodeoxyuridine), followed by a 30-min pulse of IdU (Iododeoxyuridine). After denaturalization, stretching and labelling with specific antibodies, DNA track lengths were quantified. Surprisingly, p21 loss resulted in a\u00a0reduced track length suggesting that p21 is required for a proper elongation of the replication forks (representative tracks and fields are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013F</a>). These findings were confirmed in an additional cellular model, the HCT116 p21 null cells which were compared with the HCT116 p21+/+ counterparts (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Such findings were unexpected from the perspective of the prevalent notion of p21 as a negative regulator of the cell cycle. Since defective fork elongation is generally coupled with increased origin firing (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blow et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pillaire et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Techer et al., 2016</a>), we measured the origin frequency as we did in the past (<a href=\"#bib7\">Vallerga et al., 2015</a>) [number of red-green-red tracks + red tracks only/total fibers] (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Results indicated that p21 depletion upregulated origin firing in the absence of stress (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Thus endogenous p21 is required for the optimal execution of the DNA replication program during unperturbed S phase."

Because of low origin density, the replication of CFSs is easily compromised by alterations in the replication program (<a href=\"#bib41\">Letessier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ozeri-Galai et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2012</a>).

One of them, USP1, has the ability to remove the ubiquitin moiety from PCNA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Huang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Niimi et al., 2008</a>). Mono-ubiquitinated PCNA interacts with the UBM and UBZ domains of alternative DNA pols favouring their loading to the replisomes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bienko et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kannouche and Lehmann, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Plosky et al., 2006</a>). During unperturbed replication, PCNA ubiquitination is limited by USP1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Huang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Niimi et al., 2008</a>), as evidenced by increased PCNA ubiquitination upon USP1 depletion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). In constrast, the level of PCNA ubiquitination was not modified when p21 was depleted (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Hence, p21 and USP1 regulate the recruitment of alt pols by distinct mechanisms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Intriguingly, despite such mechanistic differences, both p21 and USP1 depletion caused a similar effect (both in quality and extent) on nascent DNA elongation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), origin frequency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), the accumulation of cells with 53BP1 foci (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) and the number of binucleated cells with MN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). These results reinforce the function of p21 as a negative regulator of alt DNA pols. Moreover, mechanistically distinct regulators of alt DNA pols are equally required to preserve DNA replication and genomic stability during unperturbed replication."

                                "text": "T. Huang and colleagues have previously reported that MN accumulation induced by USP1 depletion depends on Pol \u03ba (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jones et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, we set to explore the effect of p21 on Pol \u03ba recruitment to DNA replication factories. First, we observed that Pol \u03ba foci were formed only in a modest percentage of control cycling cells (siLuc in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). However, when p21 was depleted, the percentage of cells with Pol \u03ba foci raised significantly (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). Second, the interaction of PCNA and GFP-Pol \u03ba in the chromatin fraction increased when p21 was depleted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Third, using PLA an increase in the number of endogenous PCNA/Pol \u03ba interacting foci was revealed in p21-depleted samples (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>). We hypothesized that an increased recruitment of Pol \u03ba to the replication forks in p21-depleted cell may slow down DNA elongation, triggering fork collapse and/or the generation of under-replicated DNA. To test this hypothesis, Pol \u03ba was down-regulated in p21-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and different DNA replication parameters were tested. Forty eight hours after siRNA transfection, Pol \u03ba depletion alone had no effect on most parameters, except from a modest increase in RPA foci formation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Such result may be in agreement with the role of Pol \u03ba in the replication of non-B DNA regions such as G4 cuadruplex (<a href=\"#bib15\">Betous et al., 2009</a>). Notably however, the simultaneous elimination of Pol \u03ba and p21 prevented all the phenotypes associated with p21 depletion. Specifically, Pol \u03ba depletion rescued the defective nascent DNA elongation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), the origin frequency (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), the percentage of EdU positive cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and the increased number of cells with chromatin bound-PCNA (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similarly, markers of replication stress such as RPA foci (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), \u03b3H2AX (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) and 53BP1 foci (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) were downregulated after simultaneous depletion of p21 and Pol \u03ba. Similar results were obtained when using a second siRNA specific for Pol \u03ba in U2OS cells (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>) and when employing a different cell line, HCT116 p21 \u2212/\u2212 cells (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013F</a>)."

When not accurately processed in M phase, such DNA regions are converted into complex broken-DNA structures that are transmitted to daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</a>). In G1 phase such DNA structures are sequestered and shielded in nuclear compartments described as nuclear 53BP1 bodies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bergoglio et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Harrigan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lukas et al., 2011</a>). We therefore explored whether the altered DNA replication dynamics of p21-depleted cells could lead to the mitotic transmission of DNA damage. We first noticed an increase in the percentage of cells positive for the phosphorylated histone H3, a <i>bona-fide</i> marker of G2/M transition (<a href=\"#bib49\">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</a>), upon p21 depletion which was again totally reversed by Pol \u03ba depletion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). To confirm the persistence of under-replicated DNA in mitosis, we used previously reported protocols (<a href=\"#bib23\">Federico et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</a>) to quantify 53BP1 body formation in G1 (EdU-negative). We found a significant increase in the number of spontaneous 53BP1 nuclear bodies in G1 in the absence of p21, as hallmark of incomplete DNA replication during the previous cell cycle, which was again dependent on Pol \u03ba (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>). We conclude from these experiments that the choice of Pol \u03ba in the absence of p21 is sufficient to increase the vulnerability of fragile genomic regions by delaying replication completion at these sequences. Such alteration of the DNA replication dynamics appears to be specific to Pol \u03ba since they were not rescued when Pol \u03b7 was depleted (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013F</a>)."

In agreement, the fork elongation defects and the excessive origin firing observed in p21- depleted samples were complemented by p21, but not by p21<sup>PIPMut</sup>* (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013E</a>).

To address such question we used primary cells from two independent sources: (a) human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) and (b) mesenchyimal stem cells isolated from umbilical cord (MSC). As shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A and B</a>, transfection of p21 siRNA efficiently depleted p21 from both cell types. p21 elimination caused a reduction in the elongation of nascent DNA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>), which was accompanied with an increase in origin firing (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). In turn, such alteration in DNA replication parameters correlated with the accumulation of cells with 53BP1 foci (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013F</a>) and micronuclei (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9\u2009G\u2013I</a>).

The results presented herein conclusively show that p21 is more often a positive rather than a negative regulator of the cell cycle, as its contribution is required at every S phase.

Livneh and colleagues showed that p21 impairs TLS events on transfected plasmids (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avkin et al., 2006</a>). Second, lower levels of p21 in cycling cells must be eliminated to promote nascent DNA elongation across UV damage templates by alt DNA pols (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mansilla et al., 2013</a>). Third, endogenous p21 delays the recruitment of alt DNA pols to UV-damaged replication factories in a manner that correlates with the extent of p21 degradation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mansilla et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Soria et al., 2008</a>). Fourth, the PCNA-binding domain of p21 is required to inhibit TLS activation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avkin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mansilla et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Soria et al., 2008</a>). It follows that alt DNA pols might be selectively sensitive to p21 levels which are insufficient to inhibit CDKs (<a href=\"#bib64\">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</a>). Such a difference in the levels of p21 required to inhibit different cellular processes indicates that p21 is locally concentrated at, and/or has very high affinity for PCNA (<a href=\"#bib64\">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</a>). Both replicative and alt DNA pols bind the IDCL of PCNA through PIR or PIP (PCNA interacting protein) regions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bertolin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Moldovan et al., 2007</a>). The PIR of p21 binds PCNA strongly, so that p21 is capable of disrupting the weaker interactions between PCNA and alt DNA pols (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hishiki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mansilla et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tsanov et al., 2014</a>) without affecting replicative DNA pols which have multiple PIP domains(<a href=\"#bib64\">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Soria et al., 2008</a>). Such difference may relate to the fact that replicative DNA pols utilize multiple domains and different sites to interact with PCNA (<a href=\"#bib34\">Johansson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Moldovan et al., 2007</a>)."

                                "text": "There is a tight cross-regulation of PIP box-containing proteins at replication forks which is not yet completely understood. On the one hand, it has been demonstrated that proteins with strong PIP boxes such as p21 can remove alt pols such as Pol \u03ba from replication factories (this report and [<a href=\"#bib68\">Tsanov et al., 2014</a>]).\u00a0On the other hand, this and previous reports (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jones et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pillaire et al., 2007</a>) suggest that the alt Pol \u03ba can displace replicative pols from replisomes. Conversely however, p21-PCNA interaction in S phase does not impair genomic DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib66\">Soria et al., 2008</a>) suggesting that p21 cannot displace replicative DNA pols from the replisome. Hence, some yet unknown factors/events need to be identified to understand the hierarchy of PCNA partners at forks. Moreover, variables such as the sequence of the DNA which is being replicated and the average retention time of a PCNA partner at different regions of the chromatin might have a role in such a puzzling cross-regulation among PCNA partners. We have shown that Pol \u03ba is required for checkpoint activation at stalled forks (<a href=\"#bib14\">Betous et al., 2013</a>) and during the replication of repetitive sequences (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hile et al., 2012</a>) or naturally occurring non-B DNA structures (<a href=\"#bib15\">Betous et al., 2009</a>). In agreement, Pol \u03ba depletion affected the CFS expression and RPA accumulation in our experimental settings. It is therefore possible that certain DNA regions may benefit from Pol \u03ba-dependent DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Betous et al., 2009</a>) while others it might require active displacement of Pol \u03ba by p21. If that is the case, p21 may prevent Pol \u03ba recruitment to specific regions of the genome while prompt p21 degradation by CLR4<sup>Cdt2</sup> might rapidly allow Pol \u03ba binding to others. Such p21 function could be executed either by promoting the dissociation of Pol \u03ba from replisomes or by preventing its recruitment to DNA regions that must be necessarily copied by replicative DNA pols (such as for example B-regions in the exonic DNA)."

Hence, it is unlikely that during unperturbed replication p21 would act as a specific inhibitor of Pol \u03ba. The same is valid for USP1 because the modulation of PCNA ubiquitination should regulate all alt DNA pols (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huang and D'Andrea, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jones et al., 2012</a>). Hence, p21 and USP1 depletion may result in increased loading of all alt DNA pols to undamaged DNA. In fact, others have reported increased spontaneous mutation frequency in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus of p21\u2212/\u2212 cells, (<a href=\"#bib48\">McDonald et al., 1996</a>). Such defects might depend on the unleashed activity of alt DNA pols other than Pol \u03ba (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yang and Woodgate, 2007</a>). Notwithstanding this, the phenotypes described herein are intimately associated with processive DNA synthesis events, and Pol \u03ba is a very processive alt DNA pol (the most processive in the Y family) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ohashi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhang et al., 2000</a>). Because Pol\u03ba is less processive than replicative DNA pols (<a href=\"#bib47\">McCulloch and Kunkel, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ohashi et al., 2000</a>), the coupling of a replicative DNA pol and Pol \u03ba at a single replisome may most likely generate asynchronic speed in both DNA strands. In turn, this may cause the transient accumulation of ssDNA in one strand (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In fact, low doses of APH, which are known to disrupt the DNA pol homeostasis during DNA replication, cause similar levels of CFS expression as p21 depletion (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Hence, the local degradation of p21 by CLR4<sup>CDT2</sup> may maintain the most efficient DNA elongation speed by allowing the rapid and dynamic exchange of replicative DNA pols for Pol \u03ba. In fact, a minor shift in the timing of CLR4<sup>CDT2</sup>-dependent p21 degradation is sufficient to accumulate cells in S phase (<a href=\"#bib18\">Coleman et al., 2015</a>). Notably, the elimination of not only p21 but also USP1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jones et al., 2012</a>) increases the use of Pol \u03ba during undamaged DNA replication, suggesting that the slightest modulation of Pol \u03ba activity perturbs the DNA replication dynamics. In agreement, the expression of a Pol \u03ba mutant with increased affinity for PCNA and the overexpression of Pol \u03ba generate genomic instability and tumor formation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bavoux et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bergoglio et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hoffmann and Cazaux, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">O-Wang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jones et al., 2012</a>)."

Such observation highlights a role of p21 in the face of chronic, rather than acute stress and may correlate with the multiple defects in DNA replication revealed when depleting p21 from primary cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). While p21 is a negative regulator of TLS, its role in undamaged DNA replication (revealed in this manuscript) is most possibly <i>unrelated</i> to TLS inhibition. In fact, if p21 depletion caused the accumulation of DNA lesions, the elimination of an alt polymerase should: (a) aggravate the defect (if the alt pol is essential to promote DNA replication across the replication barrier) or (b) not alter such defect (if the replication across such barrier is also achieved by another alt polymerase) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bertolin et al., 2015</a>). As our data show that the elimination of Pol \u03ba promotes DNA replication, it does not support a model in which p21 depletion generates substrates (DNA lesions) for alt pols. On the contrary, it suggests that undamaged DNA is being misused by the alternative polymerase pol \u03ba as a replication template. Hence, the contribution of p21 to unperturbed-DNA replication is most probably related to the control of DNA synthesis events on undamaged templates. In such scenario, the colocalization of the p21-CLR4<sup>cdt2</sup> complex at replication forks may be crucial to control the composition of the active replisome, allowing the selection of the most adequate polymerase 'on the go'. Such dynamic regulation would favour the most effective DNA replication speed allowing the timely activation of late and hard-to-replicate genomic regions. The coupling of p21 with ongoing replisomes may also favor other p21 functions as homologous recombination (HR) events. While such p21 function has been linked to CDK inhibition (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mauro et al., 2012</a>), it is still possible that the loading of p21 to PCNA serves to orchestrate multiple transactions at the elongating DNA. While more work is required to reveal yet hidden cross-regulations among members of the replisome, our work unveils a novel tumor suppressor function of p21 dependent on its ability to interact with PCNA. Such a\u00a0role of p21 is central for genome maintenance in the absence of DNA damage at every S phase and which might be key to prevent spontaneous oncogenic events."

After pre-extraction and fixation, interaction between endogenous p21 and PCNA was detected following manufacturer\u2019s instructions Duolink In Situ \u2013 Fluorescence (SIGMA). Briefly PLA\u2019s principle is based on detecting proteins in close proximity (30\u201340\u00a0nm) by using different species of primary antibodies. A pair of oligonucleotide (PLA probes) detect the primary antibodies bound the proteins of interest and generates a signal only when the two PLA probes have bound in close proximity, meaning that the samples are localized in close proximity. The signal from each detected pair of PLA probes is visualized as an individual fluorescent spot. These PLA signals can be quantified (counted) and assigned to a specific subcellular location based on microscopic images. Images were obtained with a Zeiss Axioplan confocal microscope and PLA spots were counted using Image J software, cells were counted as positive when more than 3 PLA spots were detected. When analyzing pol \u03ba/PCNA interaction a pol \u03ba 'home made' monoclonal antibody from mice purified by Biotem (clone n\u00b016A7-3A11) and PCNA rabbit polyclonal (Abcam ref ab18197) were used.

For example, in the case of Chk1 depletion, the mechanism may involve an initial dysregulation of origin firing which causes a depletion of dNTPs available for nascent DNA elongation (Petterman et al. &amp; Helleday, PNAS, 2010). In contrast, we postulate that the trigger for replication defects in cells depleted from p21 is not origin firing. We propose so because pol \u03ba depletion fully complements the replication defects caused by p21 depletion. Given that the function of pol \u03ba is tightly associated with the elongation of nascent DNA (and not with origin firing), we believe that in the case of this report it is more likely that the primary defect in p21 depleted samples is the slow elongation of nascent DNA at replication forks which then triggers increased origin firing as an attempt to finalize DNA replication of DNA regions which are being duplicated with a slow rate. In fact, we also speculate that such increased origin firing may prevent genomic instability to a certain extent. While the number of slow elongating fibers is frequent (they would not be detected by the stretching assay otherwise), the accumulation of genomic instability events is much less frequent (fold increase in micronuclei 2.1 in p21 depleted cells with respect to p21 positive cells \u2013 see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and more evident in regions poor in origins as common fragile sites (fold increase of 3.13-see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Hence, we believe that in the particular scenario of p21 depletion, the increased origin firing may be compensating replication defects caused by slow nascent DNA elongation."

Our data does not support, as stated in the Discussion, that p21 downregulation causes accumulation of DNA damage. First, in p21 depleted samples, nascent DNA elongation is very steady (but slow) supporting a global change in DNA replication speed rather that the random collision of replication forks with DNA damage. Second, we did not detect phospho-Chk1 accumulation (not shown in the manuscript), (<a href=\"#fig11\">Author response image 1</a>) which indicates no signs of global activation of DNA damage response. Last, and more important, the replication defect caused by p21 depletion is eliminated by pol \u03ba depletion. If the defect was caused by DNA lesions, the elimination of an alt polymerase should: a) aggravate the defect (if the alt pol is essential to promote DNA replication across the replication barrier) or b) not alter such defect (if the replication across such barrier could be achieved by another alt polymerase). Hence, our data does not support a model in which p21 depletion generates substrates (DNA lesions) for alt pols. On the contrary, it suggests that undamaged DNA is being misused by the alternative polymerase pol \u03ba as a replication template. This discussion has been incorporated in the manuscript (subsection \u201cThe biological consequences of excessive genomic DNA synthesis by Pol \u03ba\u201d)."

We believe that it is possible that other replication associated defects caused by p21 depletion (not explored in this study) could depend on another alternative polymerase. In fact, when using methanol/acetone extraction to reveal alterative pols associated with replication factories (Kannouche et al., Genes &amp; Dev. 2001), we detected increased focal organization of pol \u03ba, \u03b7, \u03b9 but not in Rev1 (see below). The difference between Rev1 and the other pols may depend on the lack of PIP box in Rev1 (Waters et al&amp; Walker G. Microbiol Mol Biol Rev, 2009). Notably, pol \u03ba is the alt pol with the lowest recruitment to replication factories in control cells (grey bars), and the one with highest fold induction after p21 depletion (<a href=\"#fig12\">Author response image 2</a>). In any case as suggested by reviewer 3, it is possible that the dysregulated use of pol \u03b7, pol \u03b9 and others specialized polymerases could also contribute to the replication defects caused by p21 depletion. Our conclusions are limited to the phenotypes (DNA replication, DNA stress markers, micronuclei and CFS instability) used in this study. Such limitations were carefully stated in the Discussion of our manuscript (see subsection \u201cThe complex regulation of Pol \u03ba by p21\u201d)."
