The aim of the current study was to analyse and compare their contribution to innate immune surveillance of the lung in the steady state with macrophage and dendritic cells (DC). ECFP and EGFP transgenic reporters based upon <i>Csf1r</i> and <i>Cx3cr1</i> distinguish monocytes from resident mononuclear phagocytes. We used these transgenes to study the migratory properties of monocytes and macrophages by functional imaging on explanted lungs. Migratory monocytes were found to be either patrolling within large vessels of the lung or locating at the interface between lung capillaries and alveoli. This spatial organisation gives to monocytes the property to capture fluorescent particles derived from both vascular and airway routes. We conclude that monocytes participate in steady-state surveillance of the lung, in a way that is complementary to resident macrophages and DC, without differentiating into macrophages."

The aim of the current study was to analyse and compare their contribution to innate immune surveillance of the lung in the steady state with macrophage and dendritic cells (DC). ECFP and EGFP transgenic reporters based upon <i>Csf1r</i> and <i>Cx3cr1</i> distinguish monocytes from resident mononuclear phagocytes. We used these transgenes to study the migratory properties of monocytes and macrophages by functional imaging on explanted lungs. Migratory monocytes were found to be either patrolling within large vessels of the lung or locating at the interface between lung capillaries and alveoli. This spatial organisation gives to monocytes the property to capture fluorescent particles derived from both vascular and airway routes. We conclude that monocytes participate in steady-state surveillance of the lung, in a way that is complementary to resident macrophages and DC, without differentiating into macrophages."

It had long been thought that once these monocytes had taken up residence in a tissue, they could only develop into tissue-resident phagocytes. Several researchers, however, recently reported that monocytes can also reside within tissues without becoming more specialized. Nevertheless, it remained unclear what these cells did when they were in these tissues."

Rodero, Poupel, Loyher et al. then showed that the monocytes and the other mononuclear phagocytes localized to different regions of the lung. Further experiments showed that these two groups of cells also moved around the lungs in different ways. The tissue-resident monocytes surveyed both the blood vessels and airways, while the other tissue-resident mononuclear phagocytes only surveyed the airways."

The lung is a mucosal surface of the body, exposed constantly to inhaled particles including pathogens, as well as other potential toxins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nelson et al., 2012</a>). Lung mononuclear phagocytes have been shown to adapt specifically to the lung environment, and contribute to lung homeostasis, scavenging, and immune surveillance (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kopf et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">The lungs at the frontlines of immunity, 2014</a>). Monocytes were originally considered to be circulating precursors of macrophages, participating in renewal of tissue-resident macrophages in steady state and recruited in large numbers in response to inflammatory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib3\">Auffray et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Geissmann et al., 2010</a>). Fate mapping approaches and parabiosis experiments have been used to argue that tissue-resident macrophages such as alveolar macrophages (AM) may be seeded from the yolk sac or foetal liver during embryonic development and can be maintained in the absence of monocyte recruitment (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guilliams et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hashimoto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Yona et al., 2013</a>). However, others have suggested the models used in these studies may disturb the availability of the key growth factor, CSF1, and do not necessarily reflect the steady state (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jenkins and Hume, 2014</a>). Whatever their normal contribution to the resident macrophage pool, monocytes derived from the bone marrow (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chow et al., 2011</a>) and spleen (<a href=\"#bib39\">Swirski et al., 2009</a>) can clearly replenish tissue macrophages after their cytotoxic depletion. Beyond this precursor role, monocytes carry out specific effector functions during infection (<a href=\"#bib37\">Serbina et al., 2008</a>) and may be involved in steady-state tissue surveillance by capturing and transporting antigen from tissue to lymphoid organs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jakubzick et al., 2013</a>)."

Peripheral blood monocytes, on the other hand, can be subdivided into two broad functional classes. In the mouse, one subset called classical monocytes, expresses high levels of both Ly6C and the chemokine receptor CCR2 but a low level of the fractalkine (CX3CL1) receptor CX3CR1, while the second, the so-called non-classical monocytes, lacks Ly6C but expresses a high level of CX3CR1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Geissmann et al., 2003</a>)."

Myeloid-restricted fluorescent reporter genes based upon various lineage-restricted genes have been used in live imaging and functional genomics (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hume, 2011</a>). A C<i>sf1r</i>-EGFP reporter gene serves as a definitive marker of MPS cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sasmono et al., 2003</a>), while a <i>Cx3cr1</i>-EGFP reporter labels the non-classical monocytes as well as subsets of tissue macrophages, including microglia, as well as a subset of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jung et al., 2000</a>). The <i>Itgax</i>-YFP transgenic mouse was considered to provide a marker for classical \u2018dendritic cells\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lindquist et al., 2004</a>) and has been used to image so-called interstitial DC in the lung (<a href=\"#bib31\">Looney et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Thornton et al., 2012</a>). However, this reporter is rather uniformly expressed in tissue macrophages associated with mucosa and in the lung provides a generic MPS marker (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hume, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2012</a>). The deletion of a conserved distal element of the <i>Csf1r</i> promoter in the <i>Csf1r-ECFP</i><sup><i>tg/+</i></sup> mouse (MacBlue) ablates expression of a reporter gene in trophoblasts, osteoclasts, granulocytes, and many tissue macrophages (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ovchinnikov et al., 2008</a>). This deleted promoter was used to construct an amplified binary transgene in which <i>Csf1r</i> promoter elements direct the expression of gal4-VP16, which in turn activates expression of a UAS-ECFP transgene. All blood monocytes in these MacBlue mice are strongly ECFP<sup>+</sup>, whereas most tissue macrophages do not express the reporter protein (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sauter et al., 2014</a>). In the current study, we combined the myeloid-specific fluorescent reporters from MacBlue mice with either <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup><i>gfp/+</i></sup> or <i>Itgax</i>-YFP transgenic mice to support in situ imaging of lung monocyte cell trafficking and compare their phagocytic activity with that of resident mononuclear phagocytes."

Stellar EGFP<sup>+</sup>ECFP<sup>neg</sup> cells were seen in the collagen membrane surrounding the lung pleura (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, green squares), deeper in the lung parenchyma with small round shapes or stellar shapes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, green squares), and along the basal membranes of bronchial airways (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, green squares). The luminal side of airways and alveoli contained large round ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells, likely AM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>, pink squares). Smaller amoeboid-like ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells were located in the interstitial space of the lung parenchyma (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>, purple squares). In overview, the pattern was consistent with previous evidence that the MacBlue ECFP transgene was expressed only in AM and monocyte-like cells, whereas most interstitial CX3CR1-EGFP expressing cells lacked expression."

Small interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells (area 61 \u00b1 17 \u03bcm\u00b2) with an amoeboid-like shape displayed a bimodal behaviour: they were either highly motile, going backwards and forwards between the alveoli, or relatively sessile with protrusions extending towards the lumen of the alveoli (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1 and 2</a>). Based upon these distinct behaviours, we defined \u2018patrolling\u2019 cells with high velocity (10 \u00b1 4.6 \u03bcm/min) and a low arrest coefficient (14 \u00b1 13%) and interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells with lower velocity (4 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcm/min) and a higher arrest coefficient (64 \u00b1 21%) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Intravenous injection of rhodamine dextran prior to mouse sacrifice permitted, during a short time frame before vascular leakage, to determine that fast moving patrolling ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells were located inside large vessels, whereas slow motile ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells appeared to be extravascular but in close contact with the vasculature (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Aside from monocytes, large round ECFP<sup>bright</sup> AM (area 121 \u00b1 23 \u03bcm\u00b2) were detected in the alveolar lumina, leisurely surveying the surface of the airways with a velocity of 2 \u00b1 1.5 \u03bcm/min and a high arrest coefficient (76 \u00b1 19%) (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Interstitial EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells also migrated slowly, with comparable velocity and arrest coefficient to AM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). To determine their motility coefficient (MC), we plotted the mean square displacement as a function of the square root of time. The MC of patrolling monocytes was 30-fold higher than the MC of interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells (39 vs 1.3 \u03bcm\u00b2/min) and a further fourfold higher than the MC of AM (0.3 \u03bcm\u00b2/min) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This higher MC in interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> monocytes was attributable to the protrusive activity and slow displacement suggesting scanning of the interalveolar space (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a><b>)</b>. Time lapse imaging of explanted non-transgenic lungs from parabiont mice showed similar scanning behaviour (<a href=\"#media5\">Videos 5 and 6</a>), supporting the monocyte origin of these cells. In overview, while AM survey the luminal side of the alveoli, interstitial monocyte-derived cells survey the lung tissue through either active patrolling in the vasculature or protrusive activity toward the alveolar space."

The absence of functional CX3CR1 did not change the arrest coefficient (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) but did slightly reduce the MC of patrolling cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

On the other hand, deletion of the CX3CR1 clearly altered the behaviour of the interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells, which showed a greatly increased arrest coefficient and reduced MC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>). The scanning behaviour was also strongly affected.

CD11c is expressed on all tissue macrophages in the lung, but is absent from monocytes. To compare the roles of these cells in particle clearance, we combined MacBlue with the <i>Itgax</i>-YFP transgene (MacBlue\u00d7<i>Itgax</i>-YFP) and again compared the fluorescent signatures of different mononuclear phagocyte populations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). According to previous phenotyping, Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes were CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>\u2212</sup>SiglecF<sup>-</sup>IAb<sup>low</sup>CD64<sup>low</sup>Ly6C<sup>high</sup>, Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes were CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>\u2212</sup>SiglecF<sup>-</sup>IAb<sup>low</sup>CD64<sup>low</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup>, interstitial macrophages were CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>\u2212</sup>SiglecF<sup>-</sup>IAb<sup>high</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup>, and AM were CD11b<sup>low</sup>CD11c<sup>high</sup>SiglecF<sup>high</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup>. Based upon published markers (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guilliams et al., 2014</a>), two sets of classical myeloid DC have been defined: CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC that were CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>\u2212</sup>SiglecF<sup>-</sup>IAb<sup>high</sup>CD64<sup>\u2212</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>\u2212</sup> DC that were CD11b<sup>\u2212</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>\u2212</sup>SiglecF<sup>-</sup>IAb<sup>high</sup>CD64<sup>\u2212</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We determined the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of EGFP, ECFP, and YFP reporters from the MacBlue\u00d7<i>Cx3cr1</i><sup><i>gfp/+</i></sup> and MacBlue\u00d7<i>Itgax</i>-YFP in these subsets (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). EGFP and ECFP fluorescent reporter expressions were mainly restricted to lung macrophage and monocyte subsets as previously described (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Although CD11c mRNA and surface protein are expressed widely among tissue macrophages in the lung, YFP expression was mainly restricted to the defined classical DC subsets with a brighter expression for CD11b<sup>\u2212</sup> DC (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Interestingly, AM only express the MacBlue transgene and despite expression of CD11c protein on their surface, YFP was detectable in only a small subset (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013C</a>). Thus the combination of these different transgenes permits the distinction of lung mononuclear phagocytes and lung DC. AM represented the most abundant mononuclear phagocyte subset of the lung (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Lung monocytes represented the second main mononuclear phagocyte subset and were even more numerous than interstitial macrophages, CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC and CD11b<sup>\u2212</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> DC (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Histological analysis of a lung section of MacBlue\u00d7<i>Itgax</i>-YFP showed that YFP<sup>bright</sup> cells were mainly located along bronchial airways and poorly distributed in the alveolar space in contrast to ECFP<sup>+</sup> monocytes and AM (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>)."

                                "text": "In order to further discriminate lung monocytes from circulating monocytes, we performed blood/tissue partitioning using in vivo CD45 labelling as reported by others (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Girgis et al., 2014</a>). This approach was reported to be technically challenging due to the vascular permeability of the lung (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jakubzick et al., 2013</a>). Lung mononuclear phagocyte subsets and neutrophils were labelled in different proportions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). AM were not labelled, confirming that the antibody did not reach the airways. Overall, 27% of interstitial macrophages, 12% of CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC, and only 1% of CD11b<sup>\u2212</sup> DC were labelled, suggesting a distinct location of these subsets related to the vasculature (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Up to 90% of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> lung monocytes were labelled by the anti-CD45 antibody in vivo; however, the MFI was significantly lower compared to that of blood monocytes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). We excluded that this effect was due to collagen treatment, as similar results were obtained in non-digested lungs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Furthermore, the phenotype of both Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes was slightly distinct from their circulating counterparts. Indeed lung monocytes displayed reduced expression of Ly6C, CD62L, and CD115 as previously observed, in addition to a higher level of CD11b, whereas only Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes displayed higher CD11c expression (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). The same differences were observed in monocytes isolated from lung without enzymatic digestion (data not shown). These results suggest that monocytes can be either extravascular but in close vicinity to the vessels or still intravascular and trapped in capillaries with reduced access to the bloodstream and submitted to the lung environment. MacBlue\u00d7<i>Cx3cr1</i><sup><i>gfp/+</i></sup> mice were inoculated intravenously 5 min before sacrifice with a mixture of 10 \u00b5m and 0.2 \u00b5m red fluorescent beads to differentiate large vessel areas identified by the presence of both 10 \u00b5m and 0.2 \u00b5m beads, and lung capillary areas identified by only 0.2 \u00b5m beads (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). In large vessels, ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells were mainly round shaped, whereas in the vicinity of capillaries, interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells displayed an elongated or amoeboid-like shape (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Confocal analysis of the microvascular area using CD31 staining showed that interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells locate at the interface between the capillaries and the alveoli either intra- or extravascularly (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). To confirm that this positioning allows the sampling of particles inoculated by the airways route, we performed in vivo CD45 staining of monocytes that had captured beads 4 hr after intranasal inoculation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). CD45 in vivo labelling was exactly the same for both Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes that had captured the beads compared to non-phagocytic monocytes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). This result confirmed that lung monocytes are strategically positioned at the interface between the bloodstream and airways to survey both compartments."

How this property differs from the already known functions of AM and DC was still unknown. Fluorescent myeloid-specific reporter transgenic mice have been widely used to study the behaviour of myeloid cells in vivo, although no transgenic reporter is restricted to a particular myeloid lineage (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hume, 2011</a>). LysM reporters can be used to track either neutrophils or monocytes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Faust et al., 2000</a>). A wide diversity of cell subsets are labelled in the <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup><i>gfp/+</i></sup> system, including NK cells, which can be excluded only with a specific \u03b3c-deficient background (<a href=\"#bib2\">Auffray et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, the MacGreen (Csf1r-EGFP) transgene enables labelling of a wide range of mononuclear phagocytes as well as granulocytes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sasmono et al., 2003</a>). The MacBlue binary transgene, based upon a deleted Csf1r promoter, produced a transgenic line in which the reporter gene is extinguished in the majority of mature tissue macrophages and greatly reduced in granulocytes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ovchinnikov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sauter et al., 2014</a>). Despite the fact that ECFP expression is not directly related to the level of Csf1r mRNA, it provides a unique marker of cells that have recently derived from monocytes."

Monocytes were easily distinguishable from other subsets due to their common expression of ECFP. The differential expression of EGFP enabled a further distinction between Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes. Although our imaging approach did not allow us to distinguish between the two monocyte subsets, the shape, size, tissue localization, and behaviour of the ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells provided a unique opportunity to track lung tissue mononuclear phagocytes and to compare their migratory patterns. The dual reporter also avoids potential artefacts created by the \u03b3c-deficient background excluding NK cells which we have shown to be highly represented in the CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> fraction within the lungs. The combination of CCR2 and CX3CR1 deficient mice and parabionts permitted a more precise characterization of the nature and origin of the different subsets and confirmed that interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> were monocyte-derived according to the proposed unified nomenclature (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guilliams et al., 2014</a>)."

The combination of this reporter with the MacBlue mouse confirmed that interstitial monocyte-derived cells were distinct from lung DC. Histological analysis showed that monocyte-derived cells and DC share the surveillance activity through distinct regional distribution, the former located in the alveolar space at the interface with the bloodstream and the latter near larger bronchial airways. In vivo CD45 labelling added a new dimension of regional segregation between AM, interstitial macrophages, CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC, CD11b<sup>\u2212</sup> DC, and lung monocytes. This specific regional segregation at steady state is likely the result of the rapid circulation of monocytes that arrest constitutively in the capillaries of the alveolar space with relatively short life span (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jakubzick et al., 2013</a>), whereas DC are slow motile cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Thornton et al., 2012</a>). Of course regional segregation is likely less marked in the allergic asthma model for which important DC recruitment was observed in the vicinity of the alveoli, likely originating from monocytes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jakubzick et al., 2008</a>), where they exert longer transepithelial dendrites formation toward airways (<a href=\"#bib41\">Thornton et al., 2012</a>). Our data demonstrate that the interstitial space of the lung is intensively surveyed by monocytes actively migrating or extending processes. The strategic positioning of lung monocytes at the interface allows for efficient capture of both blood and airway-derived particles. Four hours after intranasal inoculation, fluorescent particles remained undetectable in the mediastinal lymph nodes, as previously observed (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jakubzick et al., 2008</a>; data not shown), however after 1 d, DC seem to prevail over monocytes in the transport of the inhaled particles. This suggests that the majority of monocytes may scavenge particles to clean up the tissue and filter the blood, whereas the majority of DC aim to transport antigen to the draining lymph node."

We determined that lung permeability does not allow it to be definitely concluded that lung monocytes share their time either intra- or extravascularly or even both. However, we showed that lung monocytes have a slightly differentiated phenotype compared to the circulating monocytes with a downregulation of CD115 and CD62L and an upregulation of CD11b and CD11c. Secondly, the proportions of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes were different in the lungs compared to the blood. Finally, monocyte localization in the vicinity of the bloodstream allows them to capture beads inoculated via the intranasal route."

For instance, fast circulating monocytes in the blood flow could not be observed. Nevertheless, we still observed high velocity patrolling cells that were present within large vessels, suggesting that this migration is independent of the blood flow. This approach provides at least the advantage of better stability without breathing constraints and avoids any accumulation of inflammatory monocytes due to inflammation. Other monocyte behaviour might be observed using in vivo imaging."

Kim et al. showed that CX3CL1 was expressed by the epithelial cells of bronchioles and in the alveolar space using the CX3CL1-RFP reporters (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2011</a>), arguing in favour of the role of this axis in protrusive activity of the CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> monocyte-derived cells. Because CX3CR1 is an important survival pathway, it is unclear whether these modifications are related to defects in chemotactic signal or cell survival. We did not observe defects in phagocytosis in CX3CR1-deficient mice (unpublished data), suggesting that the recently recruited monocytes are functional, arguing in favour of a role of CX3CR1 in their survival (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2011</a>)."

We concluded that tissue monocytes represent a major first line phagocytic compartment in comparison to DC. Monocyte-derived cells developed an organized distribution at the interface between blood and airways with a specific pattern of movements in the lungs to enable them to rapidly detect danger, trigger inflammation, capture antigen, and undergo subsequent immune response. Understanding these activities is a key step towards improving the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory diseases and also vaccination strategies targeting the route of antigen uptake."

The local temperature was monitored and maintained at 37\u00b0C. For some experiments, 2 MkDa rhodamine dextran was injected intravenously 1 min before euthanasia and lung vasculature was ligatured to reduce leakage of the dye. The two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) set-up used consisted of a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss) coupled to a Ti:Sapphire crystal laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which provides 140 fs pulses of NIR light, selectively tunable between 680 and 1080 nm, and an acousto-optic modulator to control laser power. The system included three external non-descanned detectors that enabled the simultaneous recording of three fluorescent channels with a combination of two dichroic mirrors (565 nm and 690 nm), 565/610 and 500/550 bandpass filters, and a 485 lowpass filter. The excitation wavelength was 870 nm. Cell motility was measured every 30 s by five consecutive 3 \u03bcm z spacing stacks (total thickness of 12 \u03bcm) with a plan apochromat \u00d7 20 (NA = 1) water immersion objective."

The different cell subsets were defined according to the fluorescent signature, the size, the shape, the localization, and the behaviour. Typically AM are ECFP<sup>bright</sup>, large, round, and sessile cells located in the lumen of alveoli. Patrolling monocytes are ECFP<sup>+</sup> and small with an amoeboid-like shape displaying strong displacements in the interalveolar space. Interstitial monocyte-derived cells are ECFP<sup>+</sup> sessile cells displaying protrusive activity in the interalveolar space. Interstitial EGFP<sup>+</sup> are either small and round (likely NK) in the lung alveolar space, or dendritic-shaped in the pleura and along airways. Cells that could not be tracked for more than 2 min were not considered. The arrest coefficient was defined as the proportion of time each cell\u2019s instantaneous velocity (calculated for every 30 s interval) was less than 2 \u03bcm/min. The MC was determined on a 2D-based analysis by z projection of the 3D stacks, using the formula (x\u00b2/4 t) (where x represents the slope of the mean displacement as a function of the square root of time) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cahalan and Parker, 2008</a>) (see statistical section). Coefficient of sphericity variation was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation with Graphpad Prism (Graphpad, San Diego, CA, USA) of the sphericity determined for each cell on 10 consecutive planes (5 min). Velocity and sphericity were determined using Imaris (Bitplane). The acquisition and analysis protocols for all experimental conditions to be compared were identical."

Monocytes are leukocytes classically considered to be located in the blood and believed to differentiate upon extravasation into macrophage- or DC-like cells. Recently though, a tissue-resident monocyte population has been reported. The exact dwell times of these cells in the tissue, their fates and most importantly their functional relevance remain unclear. The study of blood monocytes and tissue monocytes, and the definition of their functions, is among most important outstanding issues in the field. At the same time, it is highly challenging due to the dynamics of the system. The major novelty of the work, and a development that will be of broad interest to readers beyond those in pulmonary immunology, is the development of a mouse strain that displays unique combinations of single or double fluorescent tags, allowing one to separately distinguish monocytes from bona fide macrophages or dendritic cells. The authors employ these new tagged animals to investigate the concept previously published by Jakubzick et al., Immunity 2013 that monocytes in a relatively undifferentiated state inhabit the parenchyma of the lung and display unique functions/behavior compared with macrophages or DCs. The authors carry out 2-photon microscopy to show that monocytes and DCs are highly motile in the lung but localize to distinct anatomical regions. This is an exciting finding since it suggests that both cell types might survey the organ in distinct spaces and, as shown by Jakubzick et al., transport antigen from these different locations to the draining LNs."

The authors then provide data on the migration properties of the cells and perform functional studies by challenging the mice intravenously or intra-tracheally with fluorescently-labeled latex beads and monitoring phagocytosis by the different mononuclear phagocytes. They provide evidence that tissue monocytes survey both the vascular and alveolar compartments, while surveillance of tissue resident DC and macrophages is restricted to material delivered by the tracheal route."

But it is important to point out that it depends upon what one means by clearance. The authors seem to mean the quantity of material engulfed by monocytes and in that sense it appears that macrophages were the most proficient. However, Jakubzick et al. showed that DCs were still far more likely than monocytes to \"clear\" cargo by migrating with it to the draining lymph node, although monocytes could do this too. So when it comes to moving cargo to the LN, DCs seem to prevail. It does not appear that the authors separately investigated this issue, but it would be important to clarify the meaning of \"clearance\" and make sure that they do not inadvertently imply migratory clearance. Better citation of past studies that used particulate antigen tracers would be desirable in general."

The authors seem to mean the quantity of material engulfed by monocytes and in that sense it appears that macrophages were the most proficient.
