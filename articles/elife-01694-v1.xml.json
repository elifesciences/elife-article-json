We report a stress resolution pathway initiated by the nuclear receptor LRH-1 that is independent of known unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Like mice lacking primary UPR components, hepatic <i>Lrh-1</i>-null mice cannot resolve ER stress, despite a functional UPR. In response to ER stress, LRH-1 induces expression of the kinase <i>Plk3</i>, which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor ATF2. <i>Plk3</i>-null mice also cannot resolve ER stress, and restoring <i>Plk3</i> expression in <i>Lrh-1</i>-null cells rescues ER stress resolution. Reduced or heightened ATF2 activity also sensitizes or desensitizes cells to ER stress, respectively. LRH-1 agonist treatment increases ER stress resistance and decreases cell death. We conclude that LRH-1 initiates a novel pathway of ER stress resolution that is independent of the UPR, yet equivalently required. Targeting LRH-1 may be beneficial in human disorders associated with chronic ER stress."

We report a stress resolution pathway initiated by the nuclear receptor LRH-1 that is independent of known unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Like mice lacking primary UPR components, hepatic <i>Lrh-1</i>-null mice cannot resolve ER stress, despite a functional UPR. In response to ER stress, LRH-1 induces expression of the kinase <i>Plk3</i>, which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor ATF2. <i>Plk3</i>-null mice also cannot resolve ER stress, and restoring <i>Plk3</i> expression in <i>Lrh-1</i>-null cells rescues ER stress resolution. Reduced or heightened ATF2 activity also sensitizes or desensitizes cells to ER stress, respectively. LRH-1 agonist treatment increases ER stress resistance and decreases cell death. We conclude that LRH-1 initiates a novel pathway of ER stress resolution that is independent of the UPR, yet equivalently required. Targeting LRH-1 may be beneficial in human disorders associated with chronic ER stress."

As similar targets for drugs have not been found in the unfolded protein response, the discovery of the LRH-1 pathway could lead to new approaches to the treatment of the diseases that result from ER stress."

Both the large scale of this process and the toxicity of misfolded proteins dictate that protein folding must be tightly controlled. When cellular protein folding demands in the cell exceed capacity, misfolded proteins accumulate within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER stress. In many human diseases, especially metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders, cellular folding capacities are overwhelmed by increased protein synthesis rates and/or accumulation of abnormal proteins, resulting in ER stress-mediated cell toxicity or death (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2008</a>)."

Activation of these sensors elicits downstream signaling pathways that ultimately produce three transcription factors, ATF4, ATF6, and XBP-1, which are active at genes involved in protein folding, expansion of the ER, protein degradation, and, in the case of severe stress, apoptosis. In recent years, many additional components of ER stress resolution have been identified, often with roles in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis following exposure to stress."

Treatment of knockout mice for any of the upstream UPR pathway components, <i>Atf6</i>, <i>Ire1\u03b1</i> (product of <i>Ern1</i>), or <i>Perk</i> (product of <i>Eifak3</i>), with tunicamycin, a chemical stressor that primarily affects the liver, elicits a striking phenotype. All knockouts exhibit an inability to resolve ER stress upon exposure, as well as a striking metabolic phenotype of strong and persistent accumulation of hepatic triglycerides (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rutkowski et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Teske et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). While tunicamycin is a supraphysiological stressor, these results are important because no other mouse models have been reported to share these phenotypes following ER stress, suggesting that the canonical UPR pathways are functionally overlapping, yet non-redundant, and also that the UPR contains the only required pathways for ER stress resolution."

None of the divergent roles of LRH-1\u2014notably bile acid production, development and maintenance of pluripotency, and local steroidogenesis\u2014directly imply a role in ER stress resolution. However, the fact that metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes and fatty liver disease are associated with chronic ER stress (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ozcan et al., 2006</a>), but can be alleviated by activation of LRH-1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lee et al., 2011</a>), suggested a potential connection. In the present study, this connection was substantiated by our discovery that LRH-1 is indispensible for ER stress resolution. In this unexpected role, LRH-1 initiates the kinase-driven activation of a CREB-like transcription factor following exposure to ER stress, specifically through polo-like kinase 3 (<i>Plk3</i>) induction of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) phosphorylation. This response is absent in <i>Lrh-1</i> liver-specific knockout mice, but restoration of <i>Plk3</i> induction to <i>Lrh-1</i> null cells reestablishes ER stress resolution. Similarly, expression of a constitutively active <i>Atf2</i> restores ER stress resolution capacity to <i>Lrh-1</i> null cells, and reduction of ATF2 activity sensitizes control cells to ER stress. Treatment of hepatocytes with LRH-1 agonists increases the capacity for ER stress resolution and diminishes toxicity resulting from severe ER stress. Thus, we report the existence of an unexpected kinase-driven and drug-targetable pathway responding to ER stress that lies outside of the classical UPR pathways, but is equally required for ER stress resolution."

To identify potentially relevant signaling pathways, we used the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) program to identify transcription factor binding motifs that were significantly overrepresented in promoters of the top 100 genes differentially responsive to TM between genotypes. The predominant output of this analysis was the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Among the multiple transcription factors that can bind this motif, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) was a promising candidate for further investigation based on its known roles in responding to genotoxic and oxidative stresses (<a href=\"#bib35\">van Dam et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kurata, 2000</a>). <i>Atf2</i> levels were slightly lower in <i>Lrh-1</i><sup><i>LKO</i></sup> mice compared to controls during basal conditions, but there were no significant differences in levels of <i>Atf2</i> between genotypes following treatment with TM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

In TM-treated primary hepatocytes from control and <i>Lrh-1</i><sup><i>LKO</i></sup> mice, we observed a rapid induction of ATF2 phosphorylation at the residues (T51/53, corresponding to human T69/71) required for ATF2 transcriptional activity in control mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), and this response was absent in <i>Lrh-1</i><sup><i>LKO</i></sup> mice."

However, polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3), which we found to be differentially induced by TM between genotypes (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), has also been reported to be capable of phosphorylating ATF2 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2011b</a>), although not in the context of ER stress.

We observed that ATF2 was phosphorylated in response to TM dependent on <i>Lrh-1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Luciferase reporter assays utilizing ATF2 and a cAMP response element reporter demonstrated an increase in reporter activity under ER stress conditions, suggesting increased ATF2 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Inhibition of JNK, p38, and SGK did not significantly reduce reporter activity whereas PLK3 inhibition did, arguing that PLK3 is the predominant driver of ATF2 phosphorylation following ER stress. For endogenous gene expression, we quantified ATF2 target gene <i>Atf3</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mayer et al., 2008</a>) induction following TM treatment, and observed that it was significantly blunted with <i>Lrh-1</i> knockdown. However, overexpression of a constitutively active <i>Atf2</i> (C2/Atf2; <a href=\"#bib31\">Steinmuller and Thiel, 2003</a>) or <i>Plk3</i> restored stress-inducible <i>Atf3</i> induction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>).

We treated primary hepatocytes from mice transgenic for human <i>Lrh-1</i> (h<i>Lrh-1 TG</i>) and null for mouse <i>Lrh-1</i> (m<i>Lrh-1</i> <sup><i>LKO</i></sup>) with the non-lipid LRH-1 agonist RJW100 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Whitby et al., 2011</a>). As predicted (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), co-treatment with RJW100 and TM increased expression of <i>Plk3</i> above that by TM alone (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), and this was dependent on h<i>Lrh-1</i> expression. The ATF2 target genes <i>Mcfd2</i> and <i>Atf3</i> could also be induced by RJW100 alone, which was also dependent on h<i>Lrh-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We observed no effect of RJW100 on induction of target genes dependent on any UPR transcription factor (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), leading us to conclude that the effect of RJW100 is specific to the ER stress responsive pathway initiated by LRH-1. We then treated h<i>Lrh-1 TG</i>; m<i>Lrh-1</i> <sup><i>LKO</i></sup> mouse primary hepatocytes with a low or high dose of TM, along with RJW100. For both low and high doses of TM, co-treatment with RJW100 increased ability of cells to resolve ER stress, as evidenced by less sustained UPR signaling by 48 hr post treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). To evaluate cell survival, we treated primary hepatocytes from h<i>Lrh-1 TG</i>; m<i>Lrh-1</i> <sup><i>LKO</i></sup> and m<i>Lrh-1</i> <sup><i>LKO</i></sup> mice with a range of TM doses, along with RJW100.

Since functional redundancy with the transcription factors Atf7 and Cre-bpa (Creb5) complicates study of ATF2 function in mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Breitwieser et al., 2007</a>), we overexpressed a dominant negative ATF2 in hepatocytes. Transduction of wild-type hepatocytes with this construct diminishes ability to resolve ER stress, consistent with that observed following the loss of <i>Lrh-1</i> or <i>Plk3</i>. We also found that overexpression of a constitutively active ATF2 resulted in improved ability to resolve ER stress. These results indicate that ATF2 activation is sufficient for ER stress resolution, and that activation of ATF2 or its heterodimeric partners, including ATF7 and/or CRE-BPa, is necessary. Determining genome-wide binding of ATF2 and other PLK3-responsive transcription factors in the context of ER stress should enhance our understanding of the downstream targets of this essential pathway."

In general, this could result from either signaling pathways that phosphorylate, or otherwise activate LRH-1 or its coregulators, or to increased production of an endogenous LRH-1 agonist. It could also result from increased expression of <i>Lrh-1</i> following ER stress. Unfortunately, both the very limited information on specific signaling pathways that promote LRH-1 transactivation and the absence of information on endogenous LRH-1 ligands severely limits approaches to determine whether LRH-1 is post-translationally regulated following ER stress. However, we observed that the stress-dependent induction of <i>Lrh-1</i> expression is dependent on the UPR components IRE1a and ATF6, and IRE1a also appears to impact LRH-1 transactivation. It is possible that transcriptional regulation of LRH-1 following ER stress is at least partially under control of the UPR in this regard. However, it is quite unlikely that IRE1a directly regulates LRH-1 protein, based on the constitutive nuclear localization of LRH-1 following ER stress. Future studies will be needed to characterize post-translational control of LRH-1 in a variety of contexts, including ER stress."

Additionally, treatment of cells transgenic for human <i>Lrh-1</i> with RJW100 results in the ability to resolve high levels of ER stress and protection from cell death following stress. Therefore, targeting LRH-1 in vivo with agonists or newly developed antagonists (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rey et al., 2012</a>) may allow selective augmentation or inhibition of ER stress resolution, which could prove beneficial in numerous human disorders.

This raises the interesting question of whether this LRH-1 initiated pathway contributes to a broader, kinase-driven cell defense system that can be activated by diverse stresses. Highly conserved, kinase-driven pathways are increasingly being recognized for not only being activated by ER stress, but also for facilitating ER stress resolution. In mammalian cells, specific MAP kinases have been identified that are activated by ER stress and diminish cell death following stress (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hu et al., 2004</a>). A screen for genes whose loss confers sensitivity to ER stress in <i>S. cerevisae</i> also uncovered twelve MAP kinase components, remarkable in scale considering that the yeast UPR only contains a single branch consisting of <i>IRE1</i> and substrate <i>HAC1</i> (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Chen et al., 2005</a>). We provide an additional example of such a kinase-driven ER stress resolution pathway, in which LRH-1 protects the cell through <i>Plk3</i> induction and subsequence ATF2 phosphorylation. While PLK3 is not a MAP kinase, it is important to note that ATF2 is otherwise phosphorylated by MAP kinases p38 and JNK. This suggests that the presence of LRH-1 adds an additional layer of control onto these MAP kinase pathways through activation of the atypical kinase. We are currently investigating the conservation of this response utilizing simpler model organisms, as well as investigating whether LRH-1 and downstream factors PLK3 and ATF2 are required for resolution of broader cell stresses."

Although it is as essential as any of the three canonical arms of the UPR, and appears to function independently of them, it cannot be considered a fourth arm because there is no evidence that it directly contributes to restoration of ER function, for example by promoting protein folding, and also because LRH-1 is not universally expressed. Nonetheless, our results open new directions for therapeutic targeting of ER stress in human disease, and suggest that this pathway, which links highly conserved kinase signaling and resolution of ER stress, is a prime example of the emerging integration of broad cell stress responses and regulation of protein homeostasis."

As previously described, this vector contains the DNA-binding domain of ATF2 fused with the activation domain of ATF4 to generate a constitutively active ATF2 mutant. These sequences, along with the coding sequence for LacZ, were digested with XhoI and KpnI and ligated into pShuttle-CMV (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). These vectors were electroporated into BJ5183-AD-1 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contain AdEasy-1 encoding the adenoviral backbone, for recombination.

Arrays were normalized with Chipster software (<a href=\"#bib15a\">Kallio et al., 2011</a>) using default settings for Illumina arrays. To identify over-represented transcription factor binding sites, we used the Molecular Signatures Database, part of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis software (<a href=\"#bib32\">Subramanian et al., 2005</a>). We analyzed the top 100 genes induced at least 1.5-fold by tunicamycin in control mice with significantly different induction in <i>Lrh-1</i><sup><i>LKO</i></sup> mice. Promoters from the input gene list were analyzed for enriched presence of 615 different known transcription factor binding sites (as defined in the TRANSFAC version 7.4 database). p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.

We secondarily filtered for those with significantly different expression when treated with TM by t-test (p&lt;0.05). For genome-wide binding of ATF2, we downloaded ENCODE data (wgEncodeEH002306) as a BED file and used HOMER software (<a href=\"#bib12\">Heinz et al., 2010</a>) to annotate distance to TSS for each set of peak coordinates. For genome-wide binding of LRH-1, we obtained a BED file from the lab of Tim Osborne (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chong et al., 2012</a>) and annotated distance to TSS with HOMER. For DLPC and TM-treated samples, control mice were treated with 100 mg/kg DLPC by oral gavage as previously described (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lee et al., 2011</a>) every 12 hr (twice before TM and twice afterwards) and 1 mg/kg TM by i.p. injection.

The evidence supporting that there is unresolved ER stress is primarily based on the fact that upon tunicamycin treatment or hepatectomy, the livers of knockout mice exhibit steatosis. It is important to characterize the condition of the ER with additional measures, to come closer to this interpretation. An important aspect of this is the status of the proximal sensors, such as IRE1 and PERK phosphorylation and the evidence for the emergence of maladaptive responses such as apoptotic signals, JNK activation, and others. Otherwise the possibility remains that this ER is under a new equilibrium with the boosted UPR and that LRH-1 is linked to lipid metabolism, rather than representing a bona fide novel UPR branch."

However, the current data do not establish that ATF2 phosphorylation is essential for the ER stress resolution. Could the authors knockdown ATF2 in mice liver and examine whether there is any defects in ER stress resolution after challenge? Alternatively, have the authors attempted to explore whether ATF2- or PLK3-deficient livers exhibit hepatosteosis and/or alterations in ER stress responses?"

For example, exposure of hepatocytes to toxins such as tunicamycin triggers ER stress, which then feeds into the cellular oxidative stress response. In that case, the ATF2 activation is potentially part of the redox stress response. Are there signalling cascades other than ATF2 upregulated in mice treated with either LRH-1 ligand or exogenous toxins? Comments on this would be helpful. These possibilities need to be addressed by either additional experiments looking at downstream targets of PLK3 or at least in the discussion section of the article."

We have no evidence that it directly contributes to restoration of ER function, for example by promoting protein folding, and we did not observe differential expression of UPR target genes following LRH-1 agonism (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In addition, LRH-1 is not universally expressed. Thus, as is now pointed out in the discussion, this pathway cannot be considered equivalent to the three canonical branches. We have also added \u201c<i>liver</i> endoplasmic reticulum stress resolution\u201d to the title, as suggested. Nonetheless, the PLK3/ATF2 axis is quite separate from the known UPR components, and we believe that the results strongly support our conclusion that this pathway \u201cis independent of the UPR, yet equivalently required\u201d for stress resolution."

The evidence supporting that there is unresolved ER stress is primarily based on the fact that upon tunicamycin treatment or hepatectomy, the livers of knockout mice exhibit steatosis. It is important to characterize the condition of the ER with additional measures, to come closer to this interpretation. An important aspect of this is the status of the proximal sensors, such as IRE1 and PERK phosphorylation and the evidence for the emergence of maladaptive responses such as apoptotic signals, JNK activation, and others. Otherwise the possibility remains that this ER is under a new equilibrium with the boosted UPR and that LRH-1 is linked to lipid metabolism, rather than representing a bona fide novel UPR branch</i>."

The UPR responds rapidly (within a few hours) to misfolded proteins and we have shown that our pathway is maximally activated within several hours following treatment with tunicamycin. Therefore, the bulk of the ER stress response (and, one could argue, resolution) in normal mice occurs much before accumulation of significant amounts of fat in mice deficient in ER stress resolution.

In that case, the ATF2 activation is potentially part of the redox stress response.

However, we also observed some enrichment for p53 and c-Jun target genes (as well as for LRH-1, but this is not thought to be regulated by PLK3). Interestingly, the genes in our gene set that are direct targets of p53 or c-Jun are also direct targets of ATF2. In other words, we did not identify any genes bound by p53 or c-Jun that are not bound by ATF2 in the same region (data not shown in paper for size considerations). Therefore, these studies fail to show evidence for a critical role of p53 or c-Jun in induction of these genes. The fact that expression of a constitutively active ATF2 in <i>Lrh-1</i><sup><i>LKO</i></sup> cells facilitates ER stress resolution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,G</a>) argues that ATF2 is a major functional output of PLK3 in ER stress resolution. It is possible that p53 or c-Jun may be forming complexes with ATF2 in the context of ER stress to maximize gene induction. Yet ATF2 is known to bind additional genes in our list that do not appear to be p53 or c-Jun targets, suggesting that ATF2 may work alone (or at least without these transcription factors). Since HIF1a is phosphorylated by PLK3, but this phosphorylation is destabilizing (Xu D, Yao Y, Lu L, Costa M, Dai W. 2010. Plk3 functions as an essential component of the hypoxia regulatory pathway by direct phosphorylation of HIF-1alpha.
