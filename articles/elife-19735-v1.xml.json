However, very little is known about the extrinsic signals that act on planarian stem cells to modulate rates of neurogenesis. We have identified two planarian homeobox transcription factors, <i>Smed-nkx2.1</i> and <i>Smed-arx</i>, which are required for the maintenance of cholinergic, GABAergic, and octopaminergic neurons in the planarian CNS. These very same neurons also produce the planarian <i>hedgehog</i> ligand (<i>Smed-hh</i>), which appears to communicate with brain-adjacent stem cells to promote normal levels of neurogenesis. Planarian stem cells nearby the brain express core <i>hh</i> signal transduction genes, and consistent <i>hh</i> signaling levels are required to maintain normal production of neural progenitor cells and new mature cholinergic neurons, revealing an important mitogenic role for the planarian <i>hh</i> signaling molecule in the adult CNS."
