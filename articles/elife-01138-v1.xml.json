Moreover, as I have argued before, unless scientists and the institutions that employ them make radical changes in the near future, the biomedical research enterprise in the United States will become unsustainable (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bourne, 2013</a>). Scientists in the rest of the world would be advised to pay attention to what is happening in the US and to avoid repeating these mistakes elsewhere."

The unsustainable nature of biomedical research is, comparatively speaking, small potatoes, but its roots are similar. The predicament of researchers today grew out of decades of dreaming about, and eventually achieving, bigger labs, bigger grants, and bigger research universities, medical schools and biomedical research institutes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bourne, 2013</a>)."

To some degree, this may be correct for the business of delivering medical care, which depends on economies of scale and large patient populations that include the young and healthy. But does the expand-or-die dictum apply to all biomedical research? Up to a point, certainly: large institutions allow greater numbers of principal investigators (PIs) to collaborate, to share knowledge and costly equipment, and to attract first-rate trainees and prospective PIs. Nonetheless, large institutions also suffer from real disadvantages. Visiting one highly respected mega-institution, I met two scientists who did not know that their labs were doing the same experiment, although they worked in the same building\u2014and did not even know each other\u2019s names. In addition to hampering communication, bigness can endanger an institution\u2019s vitality by damaging community morale, support for young faculty, and maintenance of uniformly high research standards. I suspect that bigness also poses similar problems at the level of individual research groups and laboratories, and that productivity per unit of funding or per working scientist starts to fall when the group or laboratory increases above a certain size (<a href=\"#bib2\">Hubel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Berg, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Fortin and Currie, 2013</a>)."

The answer is to do what you normally do in the lab\u2014that is, follow your curiosity. Start with those parts of your department or institution that you know best and explore which efforts deserve, on grounds of quality, to be expanded, which should be maintained at their current levels, and which should be reduced (or scrapped altogether). Test your conclusions by asking more questions, gathering further information and making comparisons with other parts of the department or institution (see <a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a> for more details).

At the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US, X can be Congress, the NIH director, or another agency official. In research institutions, X can be a provost or dean, a philanthropic donor, human resources, or stick-in-the-mud colleagues. And in the lab, X can be the animal care facility, the biological safety office, the NIH, journal editors, or the other scientists who review our papers and grant applications (and sometimes, sadly, the PI)."

Yes, officials at such institutions can be dazzled by indirect cost payments and expansive research initiatives, while also being ignorant of what is needed to perform high-quality science. But in the real world many administrators <i>do</i> sincerely support first-rate science: the problem is that they are forced also to spend most of their time putting out fires that have little to do with science."

Industry funds some kinds of academic biomedical research, but limits its investments to protect its profits. As billionaires grow richer in a still-stagnant economy, the obvious alternative source is philanthropy. This is not news for many academic institutions, but recently, as government support became less and less generous, state universities and medical schools in the US joined their private counterparts in a vigorous pursuit of philanthropy (<a href=\"#bib5\">Mervis, 2013</a>)."

I ask because in recent years many institutions have built large biomedical research facilities, often named after philanthropists (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bourne, 2013</a>). But many of those facilities have proved to be risky investments because it has been difficult to find enough researchers, who are reliably successful when applying for grants, to fill them. I have been told that most present-day philanthropists prefer to spend their money on buildings that are named after them, rather than on named professorships, but a senior fundraiser at Johns Hopkins University recently expressed the opposite opinion in an interview with <i>Science</i>: \u2018most donors don\u2019t want to see their names on a building. They think the institution should be responsible for the physical plant. They want to support people\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Mervis, 2013</a>). Here intuition suggests that institutional leaders themselves may often have opted for construction money, rather than support for scientists and their research, because they felt sure that NIH dollars would continue to increase. However, the days of significant increases in public funding for biomedical research are over, in the US at least. Now universities need money to pay their professors more than they need money for new buildings. It is vital, therefore, that researchers make this crystal clear to leaders of the institutions where they work, and that this message also reaches prospective philanthropists."

Although I have not met many philanthropists, one example at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)\u2014where I have spent most of my career\u2014is instructive. Herbert and Marion Sandler approached UCSF, more than 15 years ago, seeking to invest in areas of research where additional money might be leveraged into transformative discovery. They funded research that was too risky for the NIH to fund, with a remarkable result: a seven-fold return on their investment, in the form of subsequent federal grants. We need philanthropists who think like the Sandlers. Send out the search parties, now!"

For several decades I relayed this message to others, but over the past 20 years I have learned, along with many of my colleagues, that this is balderdash. Yes, some excellent investigators are superb teachers, but research luminaries can also prove pedestrian and sometimes execrable teachers of medical students. Indeed, many of the very best \u2018basic science\u2019 teachers at UCSF\u2014PhD holders who have a broad, deep knowledge of biomedical science\u2014have not worked in a lab for decades.

In other words, adhering to these mistaken axioms about teaching and research will lead to another triumph for quantity over quality. In short, it will be a sure-fire recipe for mediocrity."

The NIH budget kept growing and new discoveries came fast and furious, opening up new areas of science and bringing new treatments and ways to prevent disease. Bigger was better, top-down was useful for getting things done, philanthropists were (nearly) always right, and it made good sense for growing numbers of biomedical scientists to teach medical students. Now, none of the axioms really fits prevailing conditions or the quite different challenges we face. To meet those new challenges, we must free ourselves from the old axioms and devise a radically different model for biomedical research."
