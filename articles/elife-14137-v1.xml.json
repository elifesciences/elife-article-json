Recent studies have suggested cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition could represent a novel treatment approach or augmentation strategy for affective disorders including anxiety disorders and major depression. We show that traditional COX-2 inhibitors and a newly developed substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitor (SSCI) reduce a variety of stress-induced behavioral pathologies in mice. We found that these behavioral effects were associated with a dampening of neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) ex vivo and in vivo, and were mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel and CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation. Taken together, these data provide further support for the potential utility of SSCIs, as well as traditional COX-2 inhibitors, as novel treatment approaches for stress-related psychiatric disorders."

Recent studies have suggested cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition could represent a novel treatment approach or augmentation strategy for affective disorders including anxiety disorders and major depression. We show that traditional COX-2 inhibitors and a newly developed substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitor (SSCI) reduce a variety of stress-induced behavioral pathologies in mice. We found that these behavioral effects were associated with a dampening of neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) ex vivo and in vivo, and were mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel and CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation. Taken together, these data provide further support for the potential utility of SSCIs, as well as traditional COX-2 inhibitors, as novel treatment approaches for stress-related psychiatric disorders."

Millions of people worldwide suffer from these disorders, but there are few classes of drug treatments currently available. Some preliminary studies in mice have suggested that anti-inflammatory drugs called cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may relieve symptoms of anxiety."

Some COX-2 inhibitors, such as Celebrex, are already widely used to treat arthritis. Studies in people have also suggested these drugs given in combination with antidepressants might also help people with depression, while a recently developed COX-2 inhibitor, called LM-4131, stops the breakdown of chemicals produced in the brain that interact with the same brain receptors that marijuana does. In animal studies, this new drug reduced anxious behaviors. However, scientists didn\u2019t know if the drug would also reduce anxious behaviors after animals were exposed to a traumatic or stressful experience."

In the experiments, mice were stressed with an electric shock to their feet and then treated with LM-4131, Celebrex, another COX-2 inhibitor sometimes used in humans, or an inactive control. The mice were then placed in new environments or mazes high off the ground that usually trigger anxious behavior. The mice treated with any of the three COX-2 inhibitors were less likely to act like they were anxious than the mice treated with the control solution."

Short-term stress in humans is known to excite cells in an area of the brain called the amygdala, which controls how we respond to stress or trauma. The experiments showed that LM-4131 decreases this activity and decreases anxiety in stressed mice. Future animal and human studies are needed to confirm that COX-2 inhibitors are a useful treatment for stress disorders, and learn more about how they work."

We show that all three COX-2 inhibitors attenuate stress-induced anxiety-like states, with minimal effects on basal anxiety-like, despair-like, and locomotor behaviors.

Since stress is the major environmental risk factor for the development of mood and anxiety disorders (<a href=\"#bib7\">Caspi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kessler, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McEwen, 2003</a>), we evaluated the behavioral effects of COX-2 inhibition after stress exposure. The novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) assay is a well-validated ethologically relevant measure of both anxiety and depressive-related behaviors,\u00a0encompassing both conflict anxiety and hedonic motivational processes, and is responsive to chronic (but not acute) SSRI treatment (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cryan and Holmes, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dulawa and Hen, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Merali et al., 2003</a>). We utilized this assay to test the efficacy of a newly developed SSCI, LM-4131, relative to two clinically effective COX-2 inhibitors, LMX and Celecoxib, to reduce basal and stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in mice. Results showed that systemic administration of either LM-4131 or LMX reduced mean feeding latency in (5\u20137 week old) mice that had been subjected to foot-shock stress 8 or 24, but not 4 or 72, hours earlier (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013E</a>). Celecoxib, tested at the 8-hr post-stress time point, also reduced mean feeding latency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, only LM-4131, and not LMX or Celecoxib, produced a small reduction in mean feeding latency in non-stressed controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). It is interesting to note that the anxiety-like effect of foot-shock stress peaked at ~8\u2009hr after foot-shock, and resolved by 72\u2009hr. The delayed onset of the anxiety-like response to foot-shock may be related to time-dependent neuronal plasticity mechanism induced by the foot-shock exposure. Together, these data show that stress causes an increase in feeding latency between 8 and 24\u2009hr, which was abrogated by the acute SSCI and the traditional COX-2 inhibitor treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

Additionally, LM-4131 also reduced mean feeding latency 8-hr post-stress in female mice (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, to examine whether the SSCI, LM-4131, retained anxiolytic-like efficacy following a more chronic, severe stressor, male mice were exposed to foot-shock stress for 5 consecutive days. Under these conditions, LM-4131 administered 2\u2009hr prior to testing was still able to reduce mean feeding latency in stressed mice, but not non-stressed controls (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Finally, we tested for the effects of repeated daily treatment with LMX (used instead of LM-4131 due to its long half-life (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mangold et al., 2004</a>) for 5 consecutive days prior to acute stress exposure. This subchronic treatment regimen reduced feeding latency 8\u2009hr after stress, with no effects in non-stressed controls, thereby mimicking the effects of acute treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). There were no effects of this subchronic LMX treatment on body weight in either group (Figure S4). Also of note, neither acute LM-4131 nor LMX treatment affected overall locomotor activity in the open-field assay (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), indicating drug-induced reductions in feeding latency were not an artifact of hyperactivity. Taken together, these data demonstrate that COX-2 inhibition exerts a robust, preferential attenuation of stress-induced affective dysregulation across a range of experimental conditions."

In mice stressed 8\u2009hr earlier, treatment with either LM-4131 or LMX reduced the latency to enter an open arm and increased the latency to enter closed arm and to freeze, but did not alter open arm time or entries or total distance traveled (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Replicating data shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, under non-stressed control conditions, LM-4131 produced a slight but significant reduction in feeding latency, and this effect was blocked by co-treatment with the CB1R antagonist Rimonabant (2 mg/kg) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, LM-4131-induced decreases in feeding latency, that were seen 8\u2009hr after stress, were not prevented by co-administering a low (2 mg/kg) or higher (5 mg/kg) dose of Rimonabant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>).

Moreover, LM-4131 exerts preferential effects on anandamide over 2-AG (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hermanson et al., 2013</a>). We therefore tested whether blocking these alternate anandamide targets affected the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 after stress. Neither co-treatment with the CBR2 antagonist, SR144528 (3 mg/kg), nor the TRPV1 antagonist, Capsazepine (10 mg/kg), blocked LM-4131-induced reductions in feeding latency 8\u2009hr after stress (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). However, co-administration of the SK channel inhibitor, Apamin (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg), blocked the ability of LM-4131, as well as LMX or Celecoxib, to reduce stress-induced anxiety-like behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). To further substantiate a role for SK channels in the effects of LM-4131 after foot-shock stress, we tested whether direct activation of SK channels was sufficient to mimic the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131. Consistent with earlier data, LM-4131 reduced feeding latency in mice stressed 8\u2009hr earlier (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). The SK channel activator 1-EBIO also reduced feeding latency, and the combined administration of 1-EBIO and LM-4131 did not produce a further decrease in feeding latency relative to either drug alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Apamin and 1-EBIO had minimal effect on locomotor activity when administered alone at doses used above (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), showing these drug effects on feeding latency were not artifacts of locomotor disturbances."

Therefore, we extended our analyses to measure drug effects on total food consumption in the NIH assay to clarify whether COX-2 inhibition affects feeding via a CB1R-dependent or independent mechanism. We found that reductions in food consumption produced by testing in a novel cage (relative to the home cage) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) were partially reversed by LM-4131 in mice with prior foot-shock stress exposure, albeit not in all experiments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013F</a>). In addition, examination of feeding behavior in our CB1R antagonist studies indicated that, in contrast to the negative effects of CB1R blockade on feeding latency after stress exposure, the ability of LM-4131 and LMX to normalize stress-induced deficits in food consumption was completely blocked by either 2 or 5 mg/kg Rimonabant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G\u2013H</a>). Thus there appear to be dissociable contributions of CB1R to the stress-related consummatory and anxiolytic-like effects of COX-2 inhibition (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gamble-George et al., 2013</a>)."

Specifically, we determined the effects of LM-4131 on cellular and synaptic physiology in the BLA, given its key role in regulating anxiety and stress-response integration (<a href=\"#bib32\">Janak and Tye, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Pape and Pare, 2010</a>). In control, non-stressed mice, incubation of brain slices with LM-4131 (10\u2009\u03bcM) for 2\u2009hr did not affect intrinsic excitability (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013B</a>) or current-membrane voltage relationship (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) of BLA principal neurons, and did not affect resting membrane potential, input resistance, or action potential threshold (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Conversely, in brain slices prepared 24\u2009hr after foot-shock stress, LM-4131 incubation resulted in a significant decrease in intrinsic excitability of BLA neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013F</a>). This reduction was not associated with changes in the current-membrane voltage relationship (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>), or the resting membrane potential, input resistance, or action potential threshold (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). These data suggest that one mechanism by which LM-4131 reduced stress-induced behavioral dysregulation is via reductions in the overall activity of BLA neurons via reductions in intrinsic excitability. Consistent with our behavioral data, that the ability of LM-4131 to reduced neuronal excitability after stress exposure was blocked by the SK channel blocker, Apamin, but not the CB1 antagonist SR141716 or the TRPV1 antagonist, Capsazepine (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>)."

On this basis and given our\u00a0ex\u00a0vivo physiological data, we asked whether LM-4131-induced reductions in BLA neuronal excitability were evident in behaving mice by conducting\u00a0in\u00a0vivo single unit recordings. We employed the EPM for this experiment because preliminary work indicated robust behavioral profiles and drug effects under the chronic recording conditions. That is, during recordings, mice treated with LM-4131 and tested 8\u2009hr after stress showed increased open arm time and entries and reduced open arm latency, as compared to vehicle treated controls, consistent with an anxiolytic-like effect in this test (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013B</a>). It is interesting to note that under these recording conditions mice exhibited high levels of anxiety with open arm time ~10 s, and LM-4131 was able to increase open arm time and decrease latency to open arm entry. In contrast, in previous studies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), LM-4131 only affected open arm latency. Given that open arm time in these studies was ~25\u201340 s, these data suggest that the open\u00a0arm latency measure is more sensitive to LM-4131 treatment, but as anxiety levels increase, LM-4131 can affect more conventional measures of anxiety in the EPM including open arm time."

Firing rates of each unit were analyzed during exit from the safety of the closed arms, and were classified as being excitatory (at least 1 of 10 100-ms time bins following closed arm exit had an average Z-score of &gt;2, relative to a 1 sec pre-exit \u2018baseline\u2019), inhibitory (converse of excitatory), or unaltered (no significant increase or decrease). The proportion of units falling into each of these 3 categories was no different between vehicle and LM-4131 treated groups (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). However, the magnitude of the increase in excitatory unit activity on exiting the closed arm was significantly lower in LM-4131 treated mice than vehicle controls (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013E</a>). Furthermore, the effect of the drug was specific to excitatory activity, with no change evident for units exhibiting inhibitory activity on closed arm exits (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>).

These effects generalized to male mice of different ages, female mice, and were evident even after repeated stress exposure. Moreover, the behavioral effects of COX-2 inhibition were maintained after subchronic treatment indicating a lack of drug tolerance.

Indeed, we were unable to prevent the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 with a CB2R antagonist. The similar anxiolytic-like profile of the two other chemically distinct COX-2 inhibitors, which have no known activity at cannabinoid receptors, also argues against a CB2R contribution to the anxiolytic effects of LM-4131."

On the one hand, the prior observation that COX-2 inhibition is associated with reduced stress-induced PG levels, cytokine levels, and other markers of neuroinflammation supports the first mechanism (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dhir et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kumari et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Munhoz et al., 2008</a>). On the other hand, the current results provide some support for the alternate mechanisms. For example, the SSCI, LM-4131, does not affect production of pro-inflammatory PGs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hermanson et al., 2013</a>), yet is as effective as traditional COX-2 inhibitors in reducing stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. In addition, SK channel blockade and to a lesser extent, CB1R antagonism, both of which are molecular targets of the eCB anandamide, block some behavioral effects of LM-4131, LMX, and Celecoxib. Consistent with our data, systemic and intra-BLA SK channel activation has been shown to reduce stress-induced anxiety and expression of conditioned-fear (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atchley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rau et al., 2015</a>). Finally, it is also possible that reductions in prostamides or prostaglandin-glycerols contribute to the anxiolytic-like actions of traditional COX-2 inhibitors and especially SSCIs. However, very little is currently known regarding the physiological role of these metabolites in the regulation of stress responses or behavior in general. Future studies will thus be aimed at determining the differential contributions of these three potential mechanisms of action of COX-2 inhibitors to reduce stress-related pathology."

We also found the decrease in BLA neuron excitability induced by LM-4131\u00a0ex\u00a0vivo was blocked by the SK channel antagonist Apamin, but not the CB1 or TRPV1 antagonists, mirroring our behavioral studies. It is unlikely that that the cellular effects of LM-4131 are mediated via decreases in PG signaling since our in\u00a0vitro\u00a0data indicate that LM-4131 is a very weak inhibitor of AA oxygenation by COX-2 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hermanson et al., 2013</a>).

Given the strong link between amygdala neuron activity and generation of anxiety and fear states (<a href=\"#bib32\">Janak and Tye, 2015</a>), these data suggest that LM-4131 could reduce anxiety-like behavior by modulating encoding of negative valence by BLA neurons; though further studies will be required to substantiate this idea.

These findings are generally consistent with the known role of COX-2 as an immediate-early gene up-regulated by neurons in response to various types of stress (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaufmann et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kulmacz and Lands, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yamagata et al., 1993</a>). On this basis, it has been proposed that stress exposure could increase susceptibility to depression via generation of inflammatory PGs generated by COX-2; a contention in line with the neuroimmune hypothesis of depression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Felger and Miller, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Haroon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Miller et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Raison and Miller, 2013</a>) and the aforementioned clinical efficacy of COX-2 inhibition in MDD."

                        "text": "The current study extends this model by supporting additional mechanisms by which COX-2 could exert therapeutic effects; specifically, via eCB augmentation and possibly reductions in COX-2 eCB oxidative metabolites, which are known to have actions opposing eCBs in some systems (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ligresti et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sang et al., 2006</a>). This alternate hypothesis is consistent with data suggesting eCB deficiencies could contribute to the pathogenesis of some anxiety disorders, including PTSD (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hill and Patel, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jenniches et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shonesy et al., 2014</a>). Our preclinical data support robust effects of COX-2 inhibition in fear and anxiety-domain behaviors, but preliminary analysis of anhedonia and despair-like behavior were negative. Therefore, although anxiety symptoms are highly reported in patients with MDD (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fava et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fried et al., 2015</a>), and anxiety disorders and MDD are highly co-morbid (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kessler et al., 2005</a>), our data suggest clinical trials of COX-2 inhibitors in anxiety and trauma- and stressor-related disorders may also be warranted, and that SSCIs could represent a potentially attractive class of novel therapeutics for mood and anxiety disorders."

In these experiments open arm time is very low due to the anxiogenic conditions of being tethered and having electrophysiological headpieces attached to the mouse. We hypothesize that the latency measure is the most sensitive to COX-2 inhibition, but that under very high anxiety states (such as seen in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), open arm time can also be affected. We have noted this hypothesis in the subsection \u201cLM-4131 dampens anxiety-related amygdala neuronal activity in vivo\u201c."

Therefore, we prefer to keep the summary data analysis to the entire duration of the experiment."

Therefore, I feel that this research is suitable for the publication in eLife. However, I have two minor concerns. First, do LMX and Celecoxib also produce anxiolytic effects through SK channel? Second, can LM-4131-elicited electrophysiological effects on brain slices and in vivo animals be blocked by SK channel inhibitor, but not by CB1R or TRPV1R antagonist?"

Additionally, we show that anxiolytic effects of LMX and Celecoxib are also blocked by Apamin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), similarly to LM-4131."

However, we have now indicated in the Discussion that the question of whether the same mechanisms which are also operative in the brain slice are operative in vivo, will require further investigation to be conclusive."

Upon repeating these experiments to determine the receptor mechanisms subserving these effects, the results were difficult to interpret. Specifically, it appeared that LM-4131 was not able to reduce sEPSC frequency in the presence of Apamin, Rimonabant, or Capsazepine. However, close inspection of the data revealed that in some cases basal eEPSC frequency was quite low, which could prevent observation of the LM-4131 effect due to floor effects. We feel we need to more thoroughly investigate the reproducibility and mechanistic basis for the sEPSC effect of LM-4131; however, this investigation may go beyond the scope and time limitations of the current revision. We also feel the neuronal excitability data are quite robust (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig9\">9</a> and supplements), and clearer in terms of its mechanistic basis \u2013 providing a compelling cellular correlate of our behavioral findings even if the sEPSC data are not included."
