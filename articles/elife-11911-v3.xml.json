We have determined the structure of the chromatin-tethering domain (CTD) of IE1 bound to the nucleosome core particle, and discovered that the specific interaction between IE1-CTD and the H2A-H2B acidic patch impairs the compaction of higher-order chromatin structure. Our results suggest that IE1 loosens up the folding of host chromatin during hCMV infections."

We have determined the structure of the chromatin-tethering domain (CTD) of IE1 bound to the nucleosome core particle, and discovered that the specific interaction between IE1-CTD and the H2A-H2B acidic patch impairs the compaction of higher-order chromatin structure. Our results suggest that IE1 loosens up the folding of host chromatin during hCMV infections."

                        "text": "In eukaryotes, nuclear DNA is highly packaged into chromatin by histones. The nucleosome, the basic repeating unit of chromatin, typically assembles 146\u2013147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer consisting of two copies each of H3, H4, H2A and H2B (<a href=\"#bib20\">Luger et al., 1997a</a>). Nucleosomes connected by linker DNA form a 10-nm array resembling \u201cbeads-on-a-string\u201d. The binding of linker histone further compacts the linear array into a more condensed 30-nm chromatin fiber. The interaction between the N-terminal tail of histone H4 and a specific surface region on the neighboring nucleosome termed the\u201cacidic patch\u201d plays crucial roles for the formation of 30-nm chromatin fiber (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dorigo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Luger et al., 1997a</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Song et al., 2014</a>). The acidic patch is formed by a number of negatively charged residues of H2A and H2B, including Glu56, Glu61, Glu64, Asp90, Glu91 and Glu92 of H2A, and Glu102 and Glu110 of H2B (<a href=\"#bib20\">Luger et al., 1997a</a>). Several nucleosome-binding proteins have been shown to specifically interact with the acidic patch. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that these proteins may play a role in regulating the higher-order chromatin structure by competing with the H4\u2009N-terminal tails for binding to the acidic patch of the nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kalashnikova et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">McGinty and Tan, 2015</a>)."

In addition, IE1 has been long known to associate with condensed host chromatin during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahn et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dimitropoulou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Huh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Krauss et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lafemina et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nevels et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Reinhardt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wilkinson et al., 1998</a>). The chromatin-tethering domain (CTD) located at the very C-terminal end of IE1 (a.a 476\u2013491) is responsible for the association with the mitotic chromosome, specifically through the acidic patch of the nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mucke et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Reinhardt et al., 2005</a>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the association and the impact on the structure and function of host chromatin by IE1 remain to be determined. Here we provide an analysis of the structural basis for the interaction between the CTD of IE1 (IE1-CTD) and the nucleosome core particle (NCP) and explore the impact of their binding on the higher-order structure of chromatin."

The structure shows one molecule of IE1-CTD bound to the NCP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The presence of only one IE1-CTD peptide in the complex structure is due to the availability of only one side of the NCP surface in the preformed crystal lattice, as in the case of NCP in complex with the latency-associated antigen (LANA) of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barbera et al., 2006</a>). The IE1-CTD peptide adopts an extended, v-shaped conformation with a short \u03b1-helix at its C-terminus. In the complex structure, IE1-CTD is well positioned into the acidic patch of the nucleosome formed by H2A and H2B (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). IE1-CTD contacts histone H2B at two distinct sites, the C-terminal portion of \u03b11 and the N-terminal half of \u03b1C, through van der Waals interaction and intermolecular hydrogen bonds via its mainchain groups. Specifically, the amide and carbonyl groups of Thr480 make hydrogen bonds with the mainchain carbonyl and the sidechain amide groups of Gln44 of H2B (amino acid residue numbering following that in the\u00a0reference\u00a0of\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">Luger et al., 1997a</a>);\u00a0the amide and carbonyl groups of Val484 bond the carboxylate group of Glu110 and the nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring of His106, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). IE1-CTD contacts histone H2A via a number of sidechain contacts. His481 makes one hydrogen bond with Glu56 of H2A; Thr485 and Ser487 each makes one hydrogen bond with Glu64 of H2A; and Arg486 makes hydrogen bonds with Glu61 on \u03b12, as well as with Asp90 and Glu92 located on \u03b1C of histone H2A.

Most closely related to hCMV IE1 is LANA of KSHV (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barbera et al., 2006</a>). The N-terminal CTD of LANA forms a hairpin-like structure that pokes into the acidic patch of the nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The distinctly folded IE1-CTD and LANA-CTD share certain common features of nucleosome binding. Structural comparison reveals that three IE1-CTD residues, Met483, Arg486 and Ser487, occupy the same regions of the acidic patch and engage the same sets of histone residues as the corresponding LANA residues in binding the nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C, D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2A and B</a>). In particular, Arg486 interacts with the acidic patch in a manner commonly found in the structures of protein-nucleosome complexes known to date (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013F</a>). A careful examination of the acidic patch reveals that it can be divided into three adjoining ligand-binding zones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Zone I is formed by Glu61, Leu65, Asp90 and Glu92 of histone H2A, and Glu102 and Leu103 of histone H2B; Zone II is formed by histone H2A residues Tyr57, Ala60, Glu61 and Glu64, and the latter serves as a ridge separating zone I and II; and zone III is formed by Glu56 and Ala60 of H2A, and Val41, Gln44 and Glu110 of histone H2B. The binding of an arginine in zone I is conserved among all protein-NCP complexes known thus far. Thr485 of IE1 and Leu8 of LANA are bound in zone II, which is unoccupied in other NCP complexes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Main differences accounting for the specific interaction between IE1-CTD and NCP appear to reside in His481, which is bound in zone III and makes a hydrogen bond with Glu56 of H2A, and Thr485, which is bound to zone II and forms a hydrogen bond with Glu64 of H2A. And finally, the binding of the N-terminal segment of IE1-CTD spanning residues 476\u2013480 to \u03b11 of H2B is unique to IE1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Wild-type IE1-CTD bound to recombinant human NCP with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 0.4 \u03bcM, while its mutant lacking the N-terminal segment interacting with \u03b11 of H2B (\u0394476\u2013480) reduced the nucleosome-binding affinity to a K<sub>D</sub> of 12 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). To put the binding affinities in perspective, an approximately five-fold weaker binding of full-length IE1 than IE1-CTD alone to NCP was observed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>), possibly caused by self-inhibitory effects of other domains in the full-length protein. In comparison, IE1 lacking the CTD showed no detectable binding to NCP (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). With IE1-CTD, the most severe reduction of binding affinity was seen in the H481A mutant, which has a K<sub>D</sub> of 43.4 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), while loss of one hydrogen bond by substituting Thr485 with a valine brought the K<sub>D</sub> to 11.3 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To gain further insights into the ~hundred-fold reduction of binding affinity introduced by the H481A mutation, we measured the effect of histone H2A mutation on Glu56, which interacts with His481 via hydrogen bonding and Met483 by hydrophobic/van der Waals interaction. ITC measurement shows that the NCP reconstituted with the E56R mutant of H2A, a charge-swap mutant, lowered the binding to IE1-CTD to a level beyond detection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This change of histone H2A also brought about a conspicuous reduction of the binding of LANA to NCP from a K<sub>D</sub> of 0.25\u00a0to\u00a023.4 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F and G</a>). LANA and IE1 share the methionine-mediated interaction with Glu56 in zone III of the acidic patch (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>), and the greater compromise of the binding of IE1-CTD to the H2A-E56R NCP reflects the importance of the His481-Glu56 hydrogen bond in the IE1-NCP complex, as compared to the van der Waals interaction between Thr14 of LANA and Glu56 of histone H2A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

                        "text": "The acidic patch of the nucleosome has been implicated in mediating higher-order chromatin folding via interaction with the N-terminal tail of histone H4 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Luger et al., 1997a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Schalch et al., 2005</a>). Our previous cryo-EM structure of 30-nm chromatin fiber reveals that N-terminal tails of\u00a0histone\u00a0H4\u00a0are involved in inter-nucleosomal contacts between the tetranucleosomal structural units through the acidic patches of adjacent nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Song et al., 2014</a>). Since IE1-CTD is bound at the acidic patch, it is conceivable that IE1 binding may interfere with proper folding of the 30-nm chromatin fiber. To determine the extent by which the folding of chromatin fiber is affected by IE1 binding, we incubated IE1-CTD with the in vitro reconstituted 30-nm chromatin fiber assembled with an array of 12 tandem nucleosomes carrying repeats of 177 bp 601 DNA in the presence of linker histone H1, and analyzed the sample by analytical ultracentrifugation in sedimentation velocity (AUC) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Song et al., 2014</a>). The nucleosomal arrays used for reconstituting 30-nm chromatin fiber were highly saturated and homogeneous, as examined by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion and electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). For comparison, the same batch of nucleosomal array (without H1) and 30-nm chromatin fiber (with H1) were used in AUC analysis. AUC experiments showed that, in the absence of IE1-CTD, the nucleosomal array sedimented with a median sedimentation coefficient S<sub>ave</sub> (sedimentation coefficient at 50% boundary fraction) of 36 \u00b1 1 S, and the 30-nm chromatin fiber sedimented at 51.5 \u00b1 0.6 S (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In the presence of IE1-CTD, the 10-nm nucleosomal array was unaffected while S<sub>ave</sub> of the 30-nm chromatin fiber shifted from 51.5 to 48 S, indicating that the binding of IE1-CTD made the chromatin fiber more loosely folded (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). It should be emphasized that the IE1-CTD-containing chromatin fiber represents an altered chromatin state different from both the extended 10-nm nucleosomal array and the folded 30-nm chromatin fiber. This chromatin-alteration property of IE1-CTD is shared by the full-length IE1 and fully depends on the presence of CTD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). Further AUC analyses with IE1-CTD mutants showed that they essentially retained the ability to decondense the 30-nm chromatin fiber, possibly due to their incomplete loss of NCP-binding abilities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D, E and F</a>). By contrast, chromatin fibers reconstituted with the E56R mutant of histone H2A, previously shown to be unable to interact with IE1-CTD, displayed no alteration of chromatin folding by IE1-CTD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). These observations indicate that the binding of IE1-CTD at the acidic patch of the nucleosome modulates the higher-order structure of chromatin. It should be pointed out that not all acidic patch-binding proteins affect chromatin folding, as LANA does not alter the folding of 30-nm chromatin fiber in our AUC analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>)."

A careful analysis of the landscape of the acidic patch reveals that it can be divided into distinct binding zones that host specific amino acid residues. The conserved binding mode of an arginine in zone I of NCP is important for the association of all NCP-binding partners known to date, while other zones of the acidic patch are involved in differential binding of individual partners. For example, zone III of the acidic patch hosts the binding of His481 of IE1-CTD and Thr14 of LANA, respectively. These two residues interact with Glu56 of histone H2A differently in the structure: while the \u03c4 nitrogen of the imidazole ring of His481 makes a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Glu56 of histone H2A at a distance of approximately 2.9\u2009\u00c5, Thr14 of LANA contacts Glu56 of H2A approximately 5\u2009\u00c5 away via van der Waals interaction. This difference in peptide-NCP interactions perhaps account for our observations that an E56R mutant affected the binding of IE1-CTD more severely than that with LANA."

The most promising such sites appear to lie in zone II and III, as they are less frequently occupied among known NCP binding proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, the task is more challenging to distinguish IE1 and LANA bindings, as they both interact with all binding zones of the acidic patches. Nevertheless, the identification of the E56R variant of histone H2A as an IE1-noninteracting mutant has already served as a useful tool for assessing IE1\u2019s ability to modulate the higher-order structure of chromatin. Interestingly, this chromatin-modulating activity is not shared by LANA. It was shown previously that the LANA peptide promotes the compaction of nucleosomal arrays, judged by an assay in which the folding of nucleosomal arrays was induced by magnesium ions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chodaparambil et al., 2007</a>). In qualitative agreement with the previous observation, we saw that the addition of LANA made the nucleosomal arrays sedimented slower. Nevertheless, unlike IE1-CTD, LANA has no effect on the preformed H1-containing 30-nm chromatin fiber. There are two possible reasons for the different behavior of LANA, one possibility is that LANA is bound to the chromatin fiber but did not cause any changes to the folding, and the other possibility is that LANA failed to bind 30-nm chromatin fiber. In either case, IE1 and LANA differ in their ability to affect the folding of 30-nm chromatin fiber. The contrasting properties of IE1 and LANA suggest that distinct modes of protein binding to the acidic patch of the nucleosome could exert differential influences to chromatin folding. The discovery of the chromatin modulating activity of IE1 should facilitate further mechanistic understanding of its functions in viral pathogenesis, particularly its impact on the chromatin structure of the host genome, such as transcriptional regulation."

An NCP concentration of 0.02 mM was used in all experiments, except for the titration of wild-type IE1-CTD into wild-type NCP, in which case 0.018 mM NCP was used. The peptide concentrations used were, wild-type IE1-CTD at 0.87 mM, T485V at 0.99 mM, and the rest of IE1-CTD mutants and LANA all at 0.59 mM. Detailed procedures follow a protocol published previously (<a href=\"#bib37\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). For the set of ITC experiments involving full-length IE1 and IE1\u0394CTD, a buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl was used to minimize background heat generation. Background heat measured through titrating samples from the syringe into the buffer without NCP was subtracted from the integrated data. For comparison, the binding of IE1-CTD to NCP under the same condition was also measured. In the set of experiments, an NCP concentration of 0.015 mM was used, and the concentrations of IE1, IE1\u0394CTD and IE1-CTD used were 0.51, 0.52 and 0.59 mM, respectively."

Fang et al. discover that full-length IE1 as well as IE1-CTD can modulate the structure of a reconstituted 30-nm chromatin fiber. The authors present a structure of a hCMV IE1-CTD-NCP complex at 2.8 \u212b resolution. The crystallography is well done, with good refinement parameters; the peptide is well defined."

Previously reported structure (Barbera et al., 2006) characterized latency-associated antigen (LANA) of Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus binding to the same region on the nucleosome. Fang et al., show that three residues that are identical between IE1 and LANA use the same mode of interaction with the acidic patch. Additionally IE1 makes several specific interactions. Because there is only a very limited number of NCP complex structures, and because the presented structure reveals new insights, publication in <i>ELife</i> will be considered after the following concerns have been addressed and some additional experimental observations are included that should strengthen the conclusions. The manuscript would also greatly benefit from extended Discussion."

In fact, the initial idea of generating the \u25b3476-480 deletion mutant of IE1-CTD was to see the effect of its interaction with \u03b11 of H2B. As it\u2019s shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, the deletion mutant displayed a weakened but still robust interaction with NCP. The next obvious mutation was with Gln44 of H2B, which makes a hydrogen bond with a mainchain carbonyl Thr480. However, Gln44 forms the left bank of zone III (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) that hosts the binding of both His481 of IE1 and Thr14 of LANA, both of with interact with Gln44 via van der Waals contacts. Hence, mutating this residue is unlikely to affect the interaction of one but not the other with NCP. So far, the H2A E56R mutation is the best we can do, although we haven't completely given up the hope to find such a mutation, possibly also by searching for mutations that affect the interaction between LANA and NCP but not that between IE1 and NCP. Nevertheless, this will be a separate, future work."

The full-length protein alone appeared to misbehave at a low salt concentration (50 mM NaCl) at which ITC measurements for IE1-CTD peptide were performed. To overcome this problem, we performed a new set of ITC experiments with samples including the full-length IE1, IE1-CTD and IE1 lacking CTD at 150 mM salt concentration (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). At this salt concentration, the Kd for IE1-CTD is 2.25 mM, compared to 0.42 mM at 50 mM NaCl, and the Kd for full-length IE1 is 11.33 mM, approximately 5-fold lower than that of IE1-CTD measured at the same salt concentration. IE1 lacking CTD showed no detectable bindings. The lowed NCP binding affinity of full-length could be due to the interference of the extra domains of the full-length protein, and its value relative to that of IE1-CTD is on a par with its behavior in AUC with chromatin fiber."

It cannot be the first scenario because the binding of IE1-CTD, no matter how small the molecular weight of this peptide, will increase the molecular weight of the sample. And the concentration of IE1-CTD used was 1.2 \u03bcM, at a peptide/protein to NCP molar ratio of 5, and approximately 3 times above the Kd value (0.4 \u03bcM measured at 50 mM NaCl concentration), and AUC experiments were performed using a buffer without salt, which should make the binding of IE1-CTD to chromatin even stronger. A simple and natural interpretation of the data is the second scenario, in which case the transverse dimension of the chromatin fiber becomes smaller, which is inevitably accompanied by the extension of the longitudinal dimension of the chromatin fiber. Hence, the decrease of the S-value is indicative of a \u201cdecondensed\u201d chromatin fiber. Obviously, an S-value of 48 does not correspond to the fully stretched 10-nm nucleosomal array, nevertheless, it is a significant deviation from the fully compacted 30-nm fiber, possibly representing an intermediate state between the two. At present, the molecular details of the intermediate state remain unknown, and we are pursuing single-molecular studies to find out more clues. However, this will be a separate body of work, and we hope to be able to report progress in the near future."
