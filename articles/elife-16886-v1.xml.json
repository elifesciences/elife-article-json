Here we performed single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments and uncovered two conformations of complexin-1 when bound to the ternary SNARE complex. In the <i>cis</i> conformation, complexin-1 induces a conformational change at the membrane-proximal C-terminal end of the ternary SNARE complex that specifically depends on the N-terminal, accessory, and central domains of complexin-1. Together with a previous study involving \u03b1SNAP, these data suggest that the C-terminal end of the ternary SNARE complex is more plastic than the N-terminal half. In the <i>trans</i> conformation, complexin-1 can simultaneously interact with a ternary SNARE complex via the central domain and a binary SNARE complex consisting of syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25A via the accessory domain. The <i>cis</i> conformation may be involved in activation of synchronous neurotransmitter release, whereas both conformations may be involved in regulating spontaneous release."
