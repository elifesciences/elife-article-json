In this study, we show that the prokaryotic actin homologue MreB forms pairs of protofilaments that adopt an antiparallel arrangement in vitro and in vivo. We provide an atomic view of antiparallel protofilaments of <i>Caulobacter</i> MreB as apparent from crystal structures. We show that a protofilament doublet is essential for MreB's function in cell shape maintenance and demonstrate by in vivo site-specific cross-linking the antiparallel orientation of MreB protofilaments in <i>E. coli</i>. 3D cryo-EM shows that pairs of protofilaments of <i>Caulobacter</i> MreB tightly bind to membranes. Crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerisation states of <i>Caulobacter</i> MreB reveal conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. Finally, the antimicrobial agents A22/MP265 are shown to bind close to the bound nucleotide of MreB, presumably preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilising double protofilaments."

In this study, we show that the prokaryotic actin homologue MreB forms pairs of protofilaments that adopt an antiparallel arrangement in vitro and in vivo. We provide an atomic view of antiparallel protofilaments of <i>Caulobacter</i> MreB as apparent from crystal structures. We show that a protofilament doublet is essential for MreB's function in cell shape maintenance and demonstrate by in vivo site-specific cross-linking the antiparallel orientation of MreB protofilaments in <i>E. coli</i>. 3D cryo-EM shows that pairs of protofilaments of <i>Caulobacter</i> MreB tightly bind to membranes. Crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerisation states of <i>Caulobacter</i> MreB reveal conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. Finally, the antimicrobial agents A22/MP265 are shown to bind close to the bound nucleotide of MreB, presumably preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilising double protofilaments."

Shape in eukaryotic cells is provided by the cytoskeleton that consists of actin, tubulin, and intermediate filaments. Prokaryotes also have a dynamic, filamentous network of proteins, which are homologous to the eukaryotic cytoskeletal elements (<a href=\"#bib44\">L\u00f6we and Amos, 2009</a>). In non-spherical bacteria, the actin homologue MreB (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jones et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">van den Ent et al., 2001</a>) is essential for shape maintenance as depletion of MreB through genetic knockouts or MreB-targeted drug treatment results in misshapen cells that eventually lyse (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wachi et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Levin et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bendez\u00fa and de Boer, 2008</a>). Incorrect localisation of MreB adversely affects polar targeting of protein complexes and, in some organisms, chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gitai et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Wagner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cowles and Gitai, 2010</a>). Vital for MreB's role in cell shape determination is the interaction with the elongasome, the protein complex orchestrating peptidoglycan cell wall morphogenesis. The elongasome consists of MreC and MreD (MreB's operon partners), RodA, PBP1A, PBP2, RodZ, as well as MurF, MurG and MraY (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alyahya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Favini-Stabile et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gaballah et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Holtje, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mattei et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mohammadi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Shiomi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Szwedziak and L\u00f6we, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">van den Ent et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">van den Ent et al., 2010</a>). The elongasome ensures that new glycan strands cross-linked by short peptides are inserted along the peptidoglycan scaffold during cell elongation (<a href=\"#bib12\">den Blaauwen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Goffin and Ghuysen, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Matsuhashi et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Scheffers et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Scheffers and Pinho, 2005</a>).

The MreB fibres are attached to the cell membrane via a hydrophobic loop in <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> as well as Gram<sup>+</sup> bacteria and via an additional N-terminal amphipathic helix in Gram<sup>\u2212</sup> bacteria (<a href=\"#bib67\">Salje et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Maeda et al., 2012</a>). The tendency of purified MreB from Gram<sup>\u2212</sup> bacteria to aggregate can be attributed to the presence of these hydrophobic sequences. Hence, previous biochemical and structural work has focussed on MreB from <i>T. maritima</i> (TmMreB) that can be obtained in much higher quantities than <i>E. coli</i> MreB (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nurse and Marians, 2013</a>) or <i>B. subtilis</i> MreB (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mayer and Amann, 2009</a>). MreB assembles into straight, double protofilaments in the presence of ATP or GTP and these can gather laterally into sheets (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nurse and Marians, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Popp et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">van den Ent et al., 2001</a>). Although the architecture of a single protofilament is surprisingly conserved within the actin family of proteins (<a href=\"#bib82\">van den Ent et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gayathri et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Popp et al., 2010c</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Szwedziak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">van den Ent et al., 2002</a>), the assembly of protofilaments into higher order structures differs greatly (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ozyamak et al., 2013b</a>). The overall architecture has implications for filament polarity, which affects differential growth of the filament ends and directional movement. Force-generating motors that push plasmids apart all contain pairs of parallel helical protofilaments as their basic building block (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gayathri et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Polka et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Popp et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">2010c</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">van den Ent et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Galkin et al., 2012</a>). Presumably, the membrane-binding ability of MreB and FtsA constrains their filament architecture to straight (or slightly bent), rather than helical, pairs of protofilaments. But how are these filaments arranged?"

Pairs of protofilaments are essential for cell shape maintenance in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and these are shown to be oriented in an antiparallel fashion by in vivo cross-linking. The mechanism for protofilament formation of <i>C. crescentus</i> MreB is elucidated by crystallography and shown to be reminiscent of that of other actin-like proteins, revealing the typical domain closure upon polymerisation.

Deleting the N-terminal amphipathic helix and mutating the residues in the hydrophobic loop (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) make the protein (\u0394CcMreBdh) less prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of <i>Caulobacter</i> MreB (\u0394CcMreBdh) reveals the typical actin fold, containing two domains on either side of a nucleotide binding cleft (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kabsch and Holmes, 1995</a>). Both domains are separated into two subdomains, A and B. Domain II is structurally the most preserved domain within the actin family of proteins, whereas domain IB is the most diverse. But even this domain is very similar in both <i>Caulobacter</i> MreB and <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> MreB (TmMreBh, <a href=\"#bib82\">van den Ent et al., 2001</a>), superimposing with an RMSD of 0.97 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The protofilament architecture is also very well conserved, with an identical subunit repeat distance of 51.1 \u00c5 and a similar arrangement of the longitudinal interface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, only single protofilaments were present in the <i>Thermotoga</i> MreB crystals, despite the fact that electron microscopy images clearly show doublets (<a href=\"#bib82\">van den Ent et al., 2001</a>). In contrast, the crystals of <i>Caulobacter</i> MreB contain doublets that, remarkably, crystallised in an antiparallel arrangement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The electrostatic surface potential of the double protofilaments reveals the hydrophobic loop and the basic charges surrounding the membrane-binding site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "Full-length, untagged MreB from <i>C. crescentus</i> (CcMreB) binds to a lipid monolayer as a double protofilament as shown by negative stain electron microscopy (EM, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), similarly to TmMreB (<a href=\"#bib67\">Salje et al., 2011</a>). 2D averaging of images of negatively stained filaments shows double protofilaments interacting with their flat sides (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), which coincides with other, double-helical actin-like protein filaments (<a href=\"#bib61\">Popp et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">2010c</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Salje et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gayathri et al., 2013</a>). Although the resolution is low, the entire double protofilament structure of \u0394CcMreBdh fits nicely into the 2D averaged EM images with a longitudinal subunit repeat of 5.1 nm and the widths of the doublet encompassing 6.5 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The previously reported placement of two single protofilaments of TmMreB into 2D averaged filaments, though merely an educated guess at that time (<a href=\"#bib67\">Salje et al., 2011</a>), turned out to be right. By introducing a single point mutation in the interprotofilament interface of CcMreB (V118E), single protofilaments are formed as shown by negative stain EM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Pairs of protofilaments of CcMreB distort liposomes as seen by cryo-EM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) and coat the membrane extensively (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> to uncoated membranes in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The irregular arrangement of CcMreB filaments on liposomes makes it unsuitable for subtomogram averaging. Hence, we turned to rigid lipid tubes made of <i>E. coli</i> total lipid extract mixed with C24:1 \u03b2-D galactosyl ceramide (<a href=\"#bib57\">Parmenter and Stoilova-McPhie, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Parmenter et al., 2008</a>). These tubes remain straight in the presence of MreB and are suitable for obtaining higher resolution reconstructions revealing a side view that shows how the protein coats the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Although overall appearances are very similar, TmMreB forms much straighter protofilaments on lipid tubes than CcMreB (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), making TmMreB more amenable to subtomogram averaging (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a>). Both 2D and 3D averaging unambiguously show how close an MreB filament sits on the tubes, extending the thickness of the density including the lipid bilayer to 12.5 nm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, the bilayer is resolved well and the longitudinal repeat distance of the columns protruding from the outer leaflet is in agreement with the expected subunit repeat of 5.1 nm in TmMreB protofilaments. Also, subtomogram averaging clearly demonstrates that membrane binding of MreB distorts the outer, but not the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, which is in agreement with the proposed binding mode of TmMreB via a hydrophobic loop. It is not very surprising to us that MreB has not been seen in cells by cryo-EM (<a href=\"#bib74\">Swulius et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Swulius and Jensen, 2012</a>), as tomograms of cells are usually taken at rather low magnification and high defocus, leading to a resolution lower than what is needed to resolve the leaflets of the lipid bilayer, let alone, an MreB filament from the protein-embedded membrane."

An MreBCD knockout strain (FB17), otherwise not viable, survives if complemented with extra FtsZ and a copy of a plasmid expressing MreC and MreD (p\u03bb::<i>mreCD</i>; pFB124) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bendez\u00fa and de Boer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Salje et al., 2011</a>). Additional FtsZ is provided indirectly from a second plasmid (pFB112) that constitutively expresses the transcription factor SdiA, ensuring elevated levels of FtsQAZ (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bendez\u00fa and de Boer, 2008</a>). Cells become rod-shaped and lose their dependency on elevated levels of FtsZ if complemented with a third plasmid carrying a functional copy of <i>mreB</i> under the <i>lac</i> promoter (pFB209) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This complex genetic set up enables investigation of the phenotype of MreB containing mutations that might render the protein non-functional, since MreB is essential in <i>E. coli</i>. Altered versions of MreB were introduced that carried a mutation disrupting either the intra- or interprotofilament interface (EcMreB-S284D or EcMreB-V121E, respectively, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), as deduced from the crystal structure. Indeed, a single mutation in the intra-protofilamant interface renders the protein monomeric as shown by structural analysis of the equivalent mutant S283D in CcMreB (presented below), whereas a single mutation in the interprotofilament interface results in single protofilaments as discussed above (CcMreB-V118E, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In the absence of MreB, cells are spherical (first column <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), but they revert back to rod shape when expressing wild-type MreB (second column <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). When either the intra- (S284D) or inter-protofilament (V121E) interface is disrupted, cells remain spherical (third and fourth column <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These results demonstrate firstly that MreB protofilament formation is essential for cell shape maintenance and secondly that these protofilaments need to interact with their flat sides to make functional MreB filaments."

To verify that the antiparallel arrangement of protofilaments observed both in EM and in the crystal structure reflects the functional state of MreB in cells, site-specific cross-linking was performed. Cysteine residues were introduced at specific sites in and outside the protofilament interface and mutated MreB was expressed in the MreB knockout strain as described above. But before that, cysteine residues present in native MreB had to be mutated to serine residues to ensure that any cross-linked product would arise from the newly introduced cysteine(s). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the cysteine-free form of MreB fully complemented an <i>mreB</i> knockout strain. At late log phase, the cysteine mutants were subjected to the thiol-reactive cross-linker bismaleimidoethane (BMOE). Thiol-reactive cross-linkers work by forming covalent bonds between two cysteine residues. As the protofilaments in the antiparallel arrangement are symmetry-related, certain single cysteine locations may produce a cross-linked dimer as long as the distance between the mutated residues is within reach of the cross-linker arm (\u223c8 \u00c5). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, cross-linked dimers were obtained when cysteine residues were introduced in the protofilament interface (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lanes 1\u20137, 9\u201310, 12, 13, 14), but not when cysteine residues were located outside this interface (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lanes 16\u201319), nor in the absence of any cysteine (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lane 15). When a pair of cysteine residues was introduced on opposite sides of the antiparallel protofilament interface, stronger bands for the cross-linked dimers were repeatedly obtained than those of the sum of each mutant alone, providing further proof of the antiparallel arrangement (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lanes 8 and 11, compared to lanes 6\u20137 and 9\u201310, respectively)."

                                "text": "To form a detailed picture of the requirements of MreB to polymerise, the full polymerisation cycle of MreB was investigated by X-ray crystallography. Crystal structures of CcMreB in different nucleotide states, either as a monomer or as a polymer, were determined to a resolution better than 2 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Most crystal structures were obtained using \u0394CcMreBdh, which behaved biochemically better than the full-length protein, yet was still showing correct filament formation as presented in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. A single mutation in the intra-protofilament interface (S283D, \u0394CcMreBdmh) renders the protein monomeric, as shown both by crystallography (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and by EM (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This mutant turned out to be most useful in studying the polymerisation cycle. From looking at the crystal structures of MreB in different nucleotide states, it immediately becomes apparent that surprisingly small structural changes can trigger MreB polymerisation. Monomeric CcMreB shows little structural movement between the ADP- and the ATP analogue AMPPNP-bound states (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) with domains I and II overlapping with an RMSD of 1.58 and 0.57 \u00c5, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). An initial domain closure is observed upon binding of AMMPNP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) by the monomer. This movement progresses into a full propeller twist once it reaches the double protofilament state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Upon polymerisation, domain IB shows a rotation of 21.7\u00b0 towards the nucleotide binding cleft as analysed by Dyndom (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hayward and Lee, 2002</a>). This domain closure is accompanied by a twist between domains IA and IIA, as can be appreciated from the top view in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2D</a> and from the schematic in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>. The relatively small conformational change upon polymerisation has a dramatic effect on the chemistry of the active site. In the AMPPNP protofilament conformation, the active site residues E140 and T167 coordinate a water molecule that is in line for the hydrophilic attack on the gamma phosphate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). In the monomeric state, the active site residue E140 of MreB has moved away from the nucleotide by just 1 \u00c5. But consequently, it can no longer coordinate the attacking water, which is absent in this structure, and thus renders the monomer inactive (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Once MreB is in the polymeric state, the presence or absence of nucleotide has very little effect on the overall structure, which is presumably stabilised by inter- and intra-protofilament contacts. The mechanism of disintegration of the polymer remains to be elucidated."

The anomalous difference map reveals the positions of the chlorine atoms of A22 and the di-phosphate of ADP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). At 1.5 \u00c5 resolution, it absolutely defines the exact position of a small molecule like A22. Because MP265 is much more manageable, co-crystals of MP265 and \u0394CcMreBdh were obtained in the presence of both ADP and AMPPNP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). The crystal structures of the complexes show that the inhibitor most likely prevents phosphate release in the MreB protofilament: MP265 blocks the exit channel for the phosphate and binds directly to the active site residue E140, preventing it from coordinating the catalytic water. In addition, it binds to the gamma phosphate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Interestingly, crystals containing the MreB-inhibitor complex always contain single, rather than double protofilaments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). A closer look at the inter-protofilament interface explains why double protofilaments can no longer form: as the inhibitor prevents the main dimerisation helix (Ala117-Ala130) from reaching into the interface, it causes weakening of the inter-protofilament contacts and likely reduces stability of the double protofilament (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>)."

It ensures that the amphipathic helix of both protofilaments can bind to the membrane and that both protofilaments are able to interact with bitopic proteins, such as RodZ (<a href=\"#bib83\">van den Ent et al., 2010</a>). In vivo evidence shows that the antiparallel arrangement is not an in vitro artefact and does indeed reflect the filament architecture in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a>). Filament formation could have a synergistic effect on the elongasome by bringing together components that reach a higher local concentration through the interaction with polymeric MreB. Given the almost surprising high degree of similarity between the structures of MreB from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), it is expected that the antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments is conserved among the bacterial kingdom. This has far reaching consequences for the molecular mechanism of MreB's function. Actin, MamK, ParM, and the other plasmid-segregating, actin-like proteins form pairs of protofilaments with subunits facing the same direction (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ozyamak et al., 2013b</a>). In F-actin, the polar ends exhibit different growth and shrinkage rates and selectively interact with binding partners that affect filament protection or nucleation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Pollard and Mooseker, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Wegner, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Wang, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pollard, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Selve and Wegner, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Theriot and Mitchison, 1991</a>). Pairs of parallel ParM protofilaments extend from the ParRC-interacting end (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gayathri et al., 2012</a>). Discrimination of either end has to be absent in the antiparallel arrangement found in the doublets of MreB protofilaments (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and hence MreB filaments must grow and shrink from both ends. The bidirectional movement of MreB filaments in vivo is in agreement with the above hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dominguez-Escobar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Garner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Reimold et al., 2013</a>). However, previously reported treadmilling of CcMreB molecules through filaments (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kim et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Biteen et al., 2011</a>) assumes an overall polarity that, as we show, is absent in the filament. It has to be determined whether MreB filaments fluctuate at a steady state, growing and shrinking from both ends, or exhibit dynamic instability leading to catastrophic disassembly, as described in detail for ParM (<a href=\"#bib23\">Garner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gayathri et al., 2013</a>)."

In vitro, single CcMreB protofilaments can only be formed upon disruption of the protofilament interface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Furthermore, the equivalent mutation in vivo renders the protein non-functional (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In the presence of the antimicrobial agents A22 and MP265, MreB forms single but no double protofilaments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). By dislocating one of the dimerisation helices and thereby weakening the inter-protofilament interface, the inhibitor might destabilise the MreB filament. This would explain the disruption of MreB filaments by A22 as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bean et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dye et al., 2011</a>)."

F-actin forms parallel, two-stranded helical filaments with a right-handed twist (<a href=\"#bib31\">Huxley, 1963</a>), plasmid segregating protein ParM forms parallel helical filaments with a left-handed twist, that arrange in an antiparallel fashion (<a href=\"#bib64\">Popp et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Galkin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gayathri et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2013</a>), whereas cell division protein FtsA forms pairs of straight filaments with unknown orientation (<a href=\"#bib77\">Szwedziak et al., 2012</a>). Low-resolution images of actin-like protein Alp12 suggest that two pairs of parallel filaments twist around each other in an antiparallel fashion (<a href=\"#bib62\">Popp et al., 2012</a>), whereas MamK and Crenactin form a two-stranded, non-staggered helix (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ozyamak et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Izor\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lind\u00e5s et al., 2014</a>). Despite these variations in overall filament architecture, the head-to-tail arrangement of subunits in a single protofilament is surprisingly conserved, given the low sequence similarity (\u223c15%). In addition, all protofilaments interact with each other using their flat sides, irrespective of the filament architecture. Moreover, the propeller twist required for filament dynamics in response to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis is preserved. The result of the propeller twist is the closure of domains I and II and the flattening of one side of the molecule that makes the inter-protofilament interface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The recently published molecular dynamics simulations of MreB (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colavin et al., 2014</a>) are in agreement with this observation. Furthermore, detailed structural studies of the different nucleotide states of the best studied actin-like proteins MreB and ParM show that the polymerisation cycle is fairly conserved, with the largest domain movement taking place upon the transition from the monomeric state to the polymeric form (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, [<a href=\"#bib24\">Gayathri et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2013</a>]). In both proteins, the active site geometry in the filament conformation favours nucleotide hydrolysis, which is driven by a catalytic glutamate (E140 in CcMreB and E148 in ParM) that positions the catalytic water in line with the gamma phosphate. The co-crystal structures of AMPPNP-bound CcMreB with the inhibitor confirm the critical role of this catalytic residue E140 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In the AMPPNP-bound monomer conformation, no catalytic water is present in CcMreB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), whereas the catalytic water in monomeric AMPPNP-bound ParM has moved away from the ideal geometry, thus hampering hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gayathri et al., 2013</a>)."

From the \u0394CcMreBdh co-crystal structures with ADP and AMPPNP, it is clear that the active site could well accommodate a guanidine instead of an adenine as the major contacts are with the ribose and phosphate moieties of the nucleotide, a feature, again, shared with ParM (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gayathri et al., 2013</a>)."

Cultures were cooled down by adding 30% ice and spun at 1000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet washed in ice-cold 10 ml PBSG (PBS, supplemented with 0.1% glycerol), spun at 1000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml PBSG, supplemented with 5 mM EDTA. Half of the resuspended cells were subjected to the thiol-reactive cross-linker bismaleimidoethane (BMOE, Pierce) at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M from a 20 mM stock in DMSO, whereas the same amount of DMSO was added to the other half of the cells as a control (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burmann et al., 2013</a>). After 10 min on ice, the reaction was quenched with 28 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and spun for 10 min at 14 krpm at 4\u00b0C (Eppendorf table top centrifuge). The pellets were resuspended in 600 \u00b5l B-PER (Thermo Scientific), supplemented with 25 mM DTT, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM CaCl, lysozyme, DNAse, RNAse, and incubated at RT for 10 min. The lysed cells were mixed with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Life technologies) supplemented with 8 M urea and 5 mM buffered TCEP (pH 7) and heated for 10 min 70\u00b0C. Cross-linked products were separated from the monomers on a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel (Life technologies) and detected by Western blot using affinity purified \u03b1-MreB antibodies."

Samples were stored by the instrument in 96-well microtitre plates at 5\u00b0C prior to loading and performing the ITC titrations. Standard experiments used 19 \u00d7 2 \u00b5l injections of nucleotide or MP265 into \u0394CcMreBdh protein preceded by a single 0.5 \u00b5l pre-injection. Heat from the pre-injection was not used during fitting. Data were analysed manually in the Origin software package provided by the manufacturer and fit to a single set of binding sites model. All measurements of binding were corrected using control dilution ITC experiments in which the nucleotide or MP265 was injected into appropriate buffer alone. The small endothermic heats of each injection in these experiments were fitted to a simple linear function that was subsequently subtracted from the equivalent integrated heats of the experiment when protein was present. The concentration of \u0394CcMreBdh in the cell was typically \u223c70 \u00b5M while the concentration of nucleotide or MP265 used in the syringe was \u223c2 mM."

Existing evidence demonstrates that the bidirectional movement of MreB in E. coli is cell-wall synthesis dependent (van Teeffelen et al, PNAS 2011), and recent models suggest that MreB filaments are stable in vivo, and that their movement may be the result of a passive movement on the membrane (Ursell et al, PNAS 2014). Other in vitro work fails to see any turnover of MreB after polymers are sheared (in contrast to actin) (Esue et al, JBC 2012).

Indeed, the cryo-EM averaging in this work could only be done on lipid rods that constrained MreB to straight filaments. Crystallographic methods are biased toward solving straight filaments, which leads to a concern and a comment. Firstly, the bending of filaments readily seen in vivo (and presumably required for curvature sensing; see Ursell et al, PNAS 2014) must break the symmetry of the anti-parallel filament. The authors must reconcile this in their discussion of possible MreB dynamics.

We fully agree with Reviewer 3 that we know too little to draw any conclusions on the dynamic behaviour of MreB, both in vitro and in vivo at this stage. We have deleted the paragraph on dynamic instability and briefly mention the consequences of non-polar filament ends on filament dynamics, including the possibility of a fluctuating state at the end of the first paragraph of the discussion.
