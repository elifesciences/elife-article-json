However, factors that underlie A\u03b2 deposition are incompletely understood. One proposed model suggests that synaptic activity leads to increased A\u03b2 deposition. More specifically, hyperactivity in the hippocampus may be detrimental and could be one factor that drives A\u03b2 deposition. To test this model, we examined the relationship between hippocampal activity during a memory task using fMRI and subsequent longitudinal change in A\u03b2 using PIB-PET imaging in cognitively normal older adults. We found that greater hippocampal activation at baseline was associated with increased A\u03b2 accumulation. Furthermore, increasing A\u03b2 accumulation mediated the influence of hippocampal activation on declining memory performance, demonstrating a crucial role of A\u03b2 in linking hippocampal activation and memory. These findings support a model linking increased hippocampal activation to subsequent A\u03b2 deposition and cognitive decline."
