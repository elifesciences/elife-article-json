In most cases, however, the specific mechanisms that lead to such trait\u2013trait relationships are yet unknown. Here we present an analysis of a broad spectrum of behavioral and physiological traits together with gene-expression measurements across genetically diverse mouse strains. We develop an unbiased methodology that constructs potentially overlapping groups of traits and resolves their underlying combination of genetic loci and molecular mechanisms. For example, our method predicts that genetic variation in the <i>Klf7</i> gene may influence gene transcripts in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, which in turn affect 17 behavioral traits following morphine injection; this predicted effect of <i>Klf7</i> is consistent with an in vitro perturbation of <i>Klf7</i> in bone marrow cells. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of studying hidden causative mechanisms that lead to relationships between complex traits."

In most cases, however, the specific mechanisms that lead to such trait\u2013trait relationships are yet unknown. Here we present an analysis of a broad spectrum of behavioral and physiological traits together with gene-expression measurements across genetically diverse mouse strains. We develop an unbiased methodology that constructs potentially overlapping groups of traits and resolves their underlying combination of genetic loci and molecular mechanisms. For example, our method predicts that genetic variation in the <i>Klf7</i> gene may influence gene transcripts in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, which in turn affect 17 behavioral traits following morphine injection; this predicted effect of <i>Klf7</i> is consistent with an in vitro perturbation of <i>Klf7</i> in bone marrow cells. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of studying hidden causative mechanisms that lead to relationships between complex traits."

Various studies have shown that such connections among diseases are typically attributable to a common underlying genetic or molecular mechanism (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rzhetsky et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Oti et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barab\u00e1si et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cotsapas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013</a>). Disclosure of unexpected relationships among disease phenotypes and understanding of their common mechanisms opens the way to improved disease classification and treatment. In particular, it may allow a drug approved for one disease to be used for the treatment of another disease, and provide us with the means to anticipate undesired off-target effects (e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Ashburn and Thor, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dudley et al., 2011</a>)."

One approach is to derive trait connectivity based on trait\u2013trait comorbidity, co-occurrence, and correlations (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hidalgo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blednov et al., 2012</a>). As an example, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> illustrates a sample network and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> depicts a group of correlated traits in this network. Relying entirely on trait information, however, makes it difficult to identify the shared mechanisms and to distinguish shared molecular mechanisms from shared environmental influences. Alternatively, a common way to improve predictions is by integrating relationships between genes and traits, using gene\u2013trait correlations, associations, or causal mutations (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rzhetsky et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cotsapas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hwang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gat-Viks et al., 2013</a>). Such pairwise gene\u2013trait connections were used to construct two-layer clusters (\u2018biclusters\u2019) consisting of groups of traits linked to the same group of genes. For example, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> depicts a bicluster for the sample network in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>. Notably, although such \u2018gene-based\u2019 approaches provide a list of putative non-environmental mechanisms, their utilization has two major drawbacks. First, these approaches assign a single mechanistic layer whereas in fact what is affected by genetic variation is a number of molecular components (such as transcripts), which affect the physiological traits secondarily; thus, the model should include a series of mechanistic layers and the propagation of information between them. Secondly, gene-based approaches do not distinguish between reactive, independent, and causative relationships, whereas molecular components should be related causatively to the group of traits. For example, although transcript <i>g</i><sub><i>2</i></sub> is reactive to the <i>p</i><sub><i>4</i></sub> trait but does not cause it (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), it is still part of a two-layer model (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Thus, a valid and reliable methodology for understanding similarities among distinct traits should identify a series of layers and causative relationships."

GEMOT addresses the above challenges by constructing three-layer modules in which each module consists of a group of molecular mechanisms (here, gene transcripts within a \u2018transcripts layer\u2019) translating between a genetic layer and a layer of traits. In particular, a GEMOT module is focused specifically on causative, non-environmental relationships rather than on relationships of any kind, and accordingly it includes only transcripts that are part of causative relationships (referred to as \u2018driver transcripts\u2019, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Naively, systematic identification of GEMOT modules could be obtained by a detailed reconstruction of all relationships among variants, traits and transcripts (e.g., <a href=\"#bib41\">Neto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hageman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wang and van Eeuwijk, 2014</a>). However, such a detailed reconstruction is a major computational and statistical burden, especially considering the large number of components. This problem is avoided in GEMOT by the use of a stepwise heuristic approach that drastically reduces the search space and allows scalability to large networks."

GEMOT incorporates 3 stages (I, II and III) that are schematically described in <b>B</b>\u2013<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>\u2013<b>F</b> and <b>G</b>\u2013<b>I</b>, respectively. Stage I: (<b>B</b>) High and low link-potential scores for pairs of variants and traits. A typical calculation for variant\u2013trait pairs (left: <i>v</i><sub><i>1</i></sub>\u2013<i>p</i><sub><i>1</i></sub>, right: <i>v</i><sub><i>1</i></sub>\u2013<i>p</i><sub><i>2</i></sub>). Shown are variant\u2013transcript associations (<i>y</i>-axis) and transcript\u2013trait correlations (<i>x</i>-axis) for each transcript (black dots). GEMOT uses a threshold (horizontal dashed line) to compare the distribution of transcript\u2013trait correlation in high and low transcript\u2013variant associations scores. Link potential is high (left) when the distributions of correlation differ between the high and low association range more than expected by chance; link potential is low (right) where no difference is observed. Notably, a high link potential reflects the potential that some transcripts may translate between a variant and a trait, although such transcripts are not yet specified. (<b>C</b>) Bipartite graph construction. GEMOT constructs a graph whose two parts are variants (squares) and traits (diamonds); edge weights are the link-potential scores (solid lines, high; dashed lines, low). (<b>D</b>) Bipartite module identification. GEMOT identifies \u2018heavy\u2019 biclusters in the bipartite graph (in this example, 1 module). Stage II: (<b>E</b>) Transcript link score. The input is provided by all calculated correlation and association scores (such as the three plots on the left). On the right: given a transcript, GEMOT aggregates and ranks all its scores in a horizontal track (red, correlations; blue, associations) and uses the distribution of ranks to score the transcript for significance. (<b>F</b>) Tripartite module construction. GEMOT adds high-scoring transcripts from <b>E</b>, referred to as \u2018candidate transcripts\u2019 (circles), to the module. Stage III: (<b>G</b>) Causality p value scores. GEMOT uses a statistical score to assess causative relationships (blue, significant; white, non-significant) for each transcript (row) and trait (column) in a module. Non-causative relationships attain non-significant scores (cartoon examples on the left). (<b>H</b>) Module refinement. Starting with the causality p value scores for the tripartite module (from <b>G</b>), GEMOT eliminates non-causative transcripts (left) and non-affected traits (right) in an iterative manner.

We designed GEMOT, a scalable algorithm for the systematic construction of three-layer modules, each consisting of a group of traits, their shared causal driver transcripts and a genetic variant. GEMOT is based on the notion of \u2018linked relationships\u2019 between a variant, a transcript, and a trait. Such relationships incorporate a transcript that is both associated with a variant and correlated with a trait, without a direct evaluation of the causative relationship between the three components. In particular, it relies on the observation that causative relationships are expected also to be linked relationships (but not vice versa). It is therefore possible to start by constructing candidate modules based on the potential of variants and traits to be linked through transcripts. The internal structure is then constructed within each of these modules. Notably, the linked relationships are exploited to avoid global reconstruction of the particular types of relationships, which are then confirmed only at the validation stage."

In stage I, GEMOT identifies \u2018bipartite modules\u2019 consisting of a single genomic interval and multiple traits that are connected by linked relationships through certain transcripts (e.g., traits <i>p</i><sub><i>1</i></sub>, <i>p</i><sub><i>3</i></sub>, <i>p</i><sub><i>4</i></sub> and variant <i>v</i><sub><i>1</i></sub> in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left).

The final stage (stage III) is aimed at validating the causative relationships in the candidate modules from the previous stage.

In the third stage the aim is to investigate the internal relationships within a module, thus allowing identification of driver transcripts and their affected traits. Recent methods allow structural reconstruction of a causality network (e.g., <a href=\"#bib41\">Neto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hageman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wang and van Eeuwijk, 2014</a>), and can therefore be applied on each module to reveal its internal structure. However, since such methods may fail owing to a lack of scalability to large networks, we use an alternative approach that aims only to identify the relationships among layers, without the need to infer the causative relationships within each of the layers. To that end, we devise the following 2-step procedure: We first assess the causality among all candidate transcripts and traits in a module, assuming a single representative variant for the module's genomic interval (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). We use a \u2018causality p value\u2019 score to assess the quality of such causative relationships. Next, the modules are refined by the iterative removal of transcripts and traits whose causality p values are non-significant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). The output is a list of \u2018GEMOT modules\u2019, each consisting of a single genomic interval, a group of validated \u2018driver transcripts\u2019, and their affected traits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>)."

To that end we generated a graph of the modules, where the transcripts layer of each module is connected to the module's traits and genomic interval (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). On this graph we marked groups of similar traits, such as different behavioral and physiological responses after ethanol stimulation, or the results of different thermal nociception tests. Notably, the trait collections of the different modules are partly overlapping. For example, five of the modules relate to morphine responses (nos. 2, 5\u20138) and two modules relate to thermal nociception (nos. 3 and 5). Nevertheless, although some of the modules have overlapping traits, there is no overlap between the drivers and variants of the different modules (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>), demonstrating GEMOT's ability to predict several distinct underlying mechanisms for the same collection of traits. Furthermore, a focused examination revealed that the traits of each of the modules shared a unique characteristic. For example, module nos. 6 and 2 relate to place preference following morphine injection, but at distinct time intervals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>); similarly, module nos. 1 and 3 relate to an anxiety assay, but with and without ethanol stimulation, respectively. Taken together, our results indicated high-level organization of overlapping collections of traits, while each module reflects a unique molecular and genetic signature that underlies a different trait characteristic."

For example, a module related to morphine response (module no. 2) consists of 17 different traits that were measured following treatment of mice with morphine at different time points and in various behavioral assays. Similarly, a module related to an anxiety assay (module no. 1) consists of two different traits that were measured following treatment with ethanol at different time points.

We focused on three main properties of trait pairs: the correlation among traits in a pair; the correlation between a trait pair and the transcripts; and the knowledge-based relationships among traits. As a reference we demonstrate these properties for modules that were generated using three alternative methods: (i) the trait-based hierarchical clustering approach (denoted \u2018HC\u2019; [<a href=\"#bib22\">Hastie et al., 2009</a>], as in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>); (ii) the gene-based INVAMOD algorithm, which identify pleiotropic genetic variants and their associated groups of traits in an agglomerative manner (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gat-Viks et al., 2013</a>; as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>); and (iii) a set of randomly sampled trait pairs (5% of all possible trait pairs). In particular, the bipartite modules were compared to the top 40 groups from each method (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5A,B</a>). Similar results were obtained when the eight GEMOT modules were compared to the top eight groups from each of the alternative methods (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5C,D</a>).

To systematically cover, independently of the correlation and co-association measures, the qualitative knowledge about connections among traits, we adopted the descriptive title of each trait in the GeneNetwork Phenotype Database (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2003</a>). If the descriptions of two traits included at least one shared biological term, the traits were considered as \u2018matched-term traits\u2019 and were included in our gold standard set. Using this matched-annotation set, we found that all methods attained a similar proportion of matched-term trait; the higher the correlation between traits\u2014the higher the proportion of matched terms, as expected (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5B,D</a>)."

To validate the suggested central role of <i>Klf7</i> in mediating variation in other drivers, we analyzed the influences of knockdown and overexpression of <i>Klf7</i> on gene expression in bone-marrow hematopoietic stem cells from the C57BL/6J mouse strain (termed <i>Klf7</i><sup>KD</sup> and <i>Klf7</i><sup>OE</sup>, using three and four biological repeats, respectively; data were taken from [<a href=\"#bib51\">Schuettpelz et al., 2012</a>]).

Taken together, the two lines of evidence\u2014both natural and experimental perturbations\u2014indicated that <i>Klf7</i> is a key driver mediating the effects of additional drivers in groups I and II, which in turn affect morphine response diversity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>)."

For example, the <i>p35/Cdk5</i> driver directly phosphorylates the opioid receptor (<a href=\"#bib62\">Xie et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pareek et al., 2012</a>), and the morphine adduct MO-GSH is controlled by the <i>Idh1</i> and <i>Ggt1</i> drivers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Correia et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kumagai et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Muller and Do, 2012</a>). Furthermore, morphine treatment may exert its action through cell migration and cell invasion processes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gach et al., 2011</a>): the <i>p35</i> driver, as part of the <i>p35/Cdk5</i> complex, affects the Rac/Cdc42 complex through PAK inhibition, resulting in altered cell migration (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nikolic et al., 1998</a>), while the <i>Mmp13</i> driver alters cell migration in response to morphine treatment because of its ability to degrade collagen (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gach et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Both the <i>Klf7</i> and the <i>Cdk5/p35</i> drivers activate p27 by expression or phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Laub et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Smaldone et al., 2004</a>), and p27 in turn affects the Rho GTPases Rac and RhoA, which then alter cell invasiveness and infiltration (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kawauchi et al., 2006</a>). In glioblastoma, for example, the p27/Rho pathway affects infiltration of tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ruiz-Onta\u00f1on et al., 2013</a>). In agreement with this prediction, using the Rembrandt database (<a href=\"#bib34\">Madhavan et al., 2009</a>) we found that all four top-ranked <i>Klf7</i>-mediated drivers attain significant effects on survival of patients with glioblastoma (Kaplan\u2013Meier p &lt; 1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221211</sup>, 1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, 1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> and 0.01 for the four drivers <i>Ntng2</i>, <i>p35</i>, <i>Rexo2</i> and <i>Lrrk2</i>, respectively; in all cases, FDR &lt; 0.05, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), supporting the role of module no. 2 in cell invasiveness.

For example, the <i>Klf7</i> transcript is up-regulated in response to morphine (being one of the top ten up-regulated genes [<a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2003</a>]). Both the p35 driver and its activated protein Cdk5 were up-regulated in response to acute morphine but down-regulated on exposure to chronic morphine (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ferrer-Alc\u00f3n et al., 2003</a>). The coregulated <i>Idh1</i> and <i>Ggt1</i> drivers (<a href=\"#bib39\">Muller and Do, 2012</a>) are responsible for the synthesis and degradation, respectively, of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH). A conjugated form of morphine and GSH (MO-GSH) attains higher morphine reactivity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Correia et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kumagai et al., 1990</a>) that may alter the morphine responses. However, whereas key roles of <i>Klf7</i> have been reported primarily in neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bieker, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Laub et al., 2005</a>), here we found a causative effect of <i>Klf7</i> on behavioral responses to morphine that was specific to myeloid tissue (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We cannot as yet explain this observation; however, p35/Cdk5-mediated neutrophil secretion (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rosales et al., 2004</a>) and the cytokine-mediated regulation of <i>Klf7</i> by morphine in lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2003</a>) potentially provide an explanation for this tissue specificity. Furthermore, morphine injection leads to a reduction in neutrophil infiltration 30\u2013120 min after treatment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Clark et al., 2007</a>), in agreement with the timing of causative relationships between <i>Klf7</i> and behavioral assays at 30\u2013120 min after morphine injection (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Taken together, our results suggest that in vivo behavioral responses to morphine are affected not only by neuronal activity, but also through certain components of the immune system."

Of six suggested drivers, <i>Ythdf2</i> and <i>Aldh6a1</i> were predicted as the top drivers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, right panel). The validity of this prediction is supported by the known involvement of <i>Aldh6a1</i> in brain structure (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marcadier et al., 2013</a>), and is further supported by a recent report (<a href=\"#bib37\">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014</a>) that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNA, whose readers are <i>Ythdf1</i>\u2013<i>3</i>, causes an altered locomotor response to cocaine. In this module, a significant causative role was found in myeloid cells, but not in brain, eye, liver, or lymphoid tissue (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting a novel function of myeloid cells in regulating neurobiological and behavioral traits\u2014an intriguing possibility that warrants future investigation."

Such sub-networks mimic the tripartite modules that serve as input at the third stage of the GEMOT algorithm. A single synthetic data collection consisted of genotyping, phenotyping, and gene expression for 100 such sub-networks with two characteristic parameters: number of traits and noise level; in all cases we used 100 individuals (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

Whereas previous trait-grouping methods have used genetic or molecular data separately, and thus did not validate causative transcripts (e.g., <a href=\"#bib52\">Shi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gat-Viks et al., 2013</a>; as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>), the GEMOT method aims at directly filtering and validating such relationships. Our simulations showed that GEMOT is superior to these methods in identifying trait groups that share the same underlying transcripts (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). Another strategy is to use network reconstruction methods to construct groups of related traits (e.g., <a href=\"#bib41\">Neto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hageman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wang and van Eeuwijk, 2014</a>). These methods can be applied in the case of either the complete biological network or the sub-networks within the tripartite modules. Whereas these methods are limited in their scalability and may be particularly inefficient when applied on a large number of components, our approach can be scaled to larger networks, but can construct the network only partially. For example, in comparing both running time and accuracy under increased network sizes we found GEMOT to be more scalable than the alternative network construction methods (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2B, 4B</a>)."

One possibility is that GEMOT will be applied on a compendium of molecular data from multiple tissues. In such cases, GEMOT predictions can be used to simultaneously identify both the biological mechanism and its relevant tissue. Second, GEMOT is applicable to a variety of molecular data types in addition to gene-expression data. For example, its application in blood cytokines or plasma lipids (<a href=\"#bib58\">Teslovich et al., 2010</a>) is expected to make it possible to identify molecular factors acting at the cell\u2013cell communication level. Similarly, future extensions of GEMOT may provide the means to include environmental factors as part of the module. Third, monitoring of additional strains would allow discriminating between several alternative genomic intervals for the same module, which may arise due to linkage disequilibrium between chromosomally distinct loci. Fourth, characterization of GEMOT modules that share a similar collection of traits but have different genomic intervals may reflect gene\u2013gene interactions that lead to connections among traits. Finally, GEMOT can potentially be further improved by the construction of internal causative relationships within the transcripts and the traits layers. For example, some drivers may control other drivers, which in turn affect a collection of traits (as exemplified in the case of <i>Klf7</i> in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). It should be noted, however, that GEMOT cannot distinguish cases of multiple drivers that are part of the same regulatory circuit from cases of multiple drivers that act through several distinct circuits. Rather, its predictions provide biological or clinical hypotheses for additional experimental investigations."

Edge weights are calculated as follows (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>): First, for each pair of a genetic variant and a transcript, we evaluate the genetic association between the expression of the transcript and the candidate genetic variant. This yields a \u2018variant\u2013transcript association score\u2019<i>.</i> In this study, for the case of homozygous recombinant inbred strains the association score is a \u2212log t-test p value for the different gene-expression values between the strains carrying the two possible variant alleles. For other cases, such as an outbred population, other standard association scores can be applied (<a href=\"#bib13\">Falconer and Mackay, 1996</a>). Secondly, for each pair of a transcript and a trait, we calculate the absolute Pearson correlation coefficient across genetic backgrounds. We term this score the \u2018transcript\u2013trait correlation score\u2019. Finally, for each genetic variant and each trait we compare the distribution of transcript\u2013trait correlations in high and low transcript\u2013variant association scores (a statistical t-test).

In the present study we therefore utilized the broad-sense causative relationships. We observed that samples of model M4 attained significant likelihood ratios of M1 against models M2 and M3, and we therefore defined the (broad sense) \u2018causality p value score\u2019 as the maximal across the p values attained for M1 against M2 or M3. Our simulation study (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) indicated that GEMOT attains similar performance to that of the compared methods for models M1\u2013M3, but outperforms the existing methods when adding the remaining models (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>)."

This, however, is a difficult task in the case of large tripartite modules harboring numerous components. We therefore devised an algorithm to identify the driver transcripts and their affected traits without needing to construct the module's entire network. The algorithm proceeds as follows: For each module, stage III starts with calculation of the causality scores for each pair of candidate transcripts and traits in the module, assuming a fixed single \u2018representative variant\u2019 from the module's genomic interval (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). In this study, the representative variant was the one that attained the best average association scores across the module's candidate driver transcripts. Next, an iterative module refinement is applied in two steps. In step (i) we reveal the driver transcripts that are causally related to many of the module traits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, middle). In particular, we used Fisher's method (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sokal and Rohlf, 1990</a>) to calculate the overall causality p value of a transcript (denoted \u2018transcript causality p value\u2019); only those transcripts with significant transcript causality p values were retained. The transcript causality p value is determined based on chi-squared distribution with <i>2k</i> degrees of freedom: <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c7</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>k</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mo>\u2212</mo><mn>2</mn><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo>\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mo>..</mo><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></munder><mrow><mtext>ln</mtext><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></mrow></math>, where <i>g</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is the transcript; <i>j = 1,...,k</i> are the module traits; and <i>p</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub> is the causality p value for the transcript <i>g</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> and a trait <i>j</i> assuming the module's representative variant. Next, in step (ii) those traits that do not have at least one transcript with a significant causality score are filtered out from among the transcripts that were selected in step (i) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, right). This process is repeated iteratively until convergence. Thereafter, the retained transcripts are called \u2018driver transcripts\u2019 and modules that contain at least one driver are termed \u2018GEMOT modules\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>)."

In all cases, the total \u2018number of traits\u2019 in a sub-network is <i>k</i> + 2. The simulation data was generated by using for each edge <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> \u2192 <i>a</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> in these sub-networks a linear coefficient <i>\u03b2</i> such that <i>a</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> = <i>\u03b2</i>\u22c5<i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> + <i>\u03b5</i>(<i>\u03b2</i>), <i>\u03b5</i>(<i>\u03b2</i>) \u223c<i>N</i>(0, <i>\u03c3</i><sup>2</sup>), <i>\u03c3</i> = <i>q</i><sub><i>\u03b5</i></sub>\u22c5<i>\u03b2</i>, where <i>q</i><sub><i>\u03b5</i></sub> represents the relative proportion of noise referred to as the \u2018noise level\u2019. Observe that <i>\u03b5</i>(<i>\u03b2</i>) depends on both the linear coefficient of the relationship <i>\u03b2</i> and on the noise level <i>q</i><sub><i>\u03b5</i></sub>. We generated \u2018synthetic collections\u2019 of 100 sub-networks (100 individuals in each case); each collection is constructed for a given network structure (sub-networks Net-1, Net-2, Net-3), a certain total number of traits (<i>k + 2</i> = 5, 7, 12, or 17 traits) and a certain noise level (<i>q</i><sub><i>\u03b5</i></sub> = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4). In all cases we used <i>\u03b2</i> = 1.5 for relationships <i>v</i> \u2192 <i>p</i> and <i>v</i> \u2192 <i>g</i> and <i>\u03b2</i> = 0.6 for relationships <i>g</i> \u2192 <i>p</i> and <i>p</i> \u2192 <i>g</i>."

In total, the network consisted of 100 variants, 100 traits, and 200 transcripts that were used to generate synthetic data across 100 individuals. The data for the five sub-networks were generated as in the sub-network analysis (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019), using varying numbers of traits. The remaining data were generated as follows: (i) genotyping of each variant was generated independently, as described in the causality-testing simulation (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019); (ii) for each trait and individual, data values were sampled from a standard normal distribution; and (iii) gene-expression data were generated while maintaining the correlation between transcripts of the non-module components and between them and the module component. More specifically, for each individual <i>i</i> and transcript <i>j</i> that are not in a sub-network, the gene-expression data <i>z</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub> were generated in two steps: first, to maintain correlation among all non-sub-network transcripts we sampled the real data in murine myeloid cells (data taken from <a href=\"#bib20\">Gerrits et al., 2009</a>) to generate a 200 \u00d7 200 covariance matrix, and then used this matrix to generate synthetic data values <i>x</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub> which approximately have the same covariance matrix. Next, to improve the correlation of the <i>x</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub> values with at least one co-mapped sub-network, we calculated the gene-expression data as <i>z</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub> = <i>x</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub> + <i>c</i>\u22c5<i>y</i><sub><i>ik</i></sub>, where <i>y</i><i><sub>ik</sub></i> is the synthetic gene expression for an individual <i>i</i> and the (arbitrarily selected) <i>k</i>th transcript in the sub-network (in all cases, <i>c</i> = 1)."

Furthermore, we tested an existing trait-based approach (Iterative Clique Enumeration (ICE); <a href=\"#bib52\">Shi et al., 2010</a>) and a gene-based approach (INVAMOD, <a href=\"#bib16\">Gat-Viks et al., 2013</a>).

In the perturbation experiments, what is the strain background? Are the <i>Klf7</i> knockout and overexpression effects on \u201cdriver genes\u201d (up or down-regulation) consistent with corresponding <i>Klf7</i> expression differences in the BxD population?

In some cases new nomenclature might be necessary, but many of the new terms seem to be very similar (if not identical) to widely-used, existing terms. In such cases, the paper should conform to standard nomenclature or define why such standards will not suffice. Notable examples are: \u201cvariant-gene associations\u201d instead of eQTL; \u201clinked relationships\u201d instead of Pearson correlation and \u201clink potential\u201d instead of averaged correlation; \u201cbipartite module\u201d instead of pleiotropy. Furthermore, \u201cgene drivers\u201d and the \u201cdrivers layer\u201d can probably be more simply referred to as \u201ctranscripts\u201d and a \u201ctranscript layer\u201d with appropriate context. \u201cCausality score\u201d appears to be a <i>P</i> value; why not refer to it as such? In some cases the new nomenclature can be potentially misleading, such as in the <i>Klf7</i> discussion where a <i>P</i> value is referred to as a \u201cperturbation effect\u201d. Effect size and significance are different concepts with different biological interpretations."

Additionally, the sample size in this study is very small, and BxD lines often exhibit non-local linkage disequilibrium due to limited recombination across few individuals. This can lead to many false-positive associations. How has this potential issue been addressed in the current study?"

Notably, our goal was not to develop a new method for a causality <i>P</i>-value score. Rather, we aimed to use an existing methodology with minor modifications that were required in our particular case. In accordance, we used a methodology that is very similar to Neto et al. 2013, with two small modifications: first, we use empirical rather than theoretical evaluation of the likelihood ratio distribution; second, Neto et al. was interested in a 'classical' definition of causality, where a transcript translates between a variant and a trait. Here, we were interested in an additional objective function: identifying causal transcripts in the presence of other transcripts. This situation is common in our case of GEMOT modules harboring multiple causal transcripts translating between the same variant and a group of traits. We have therefore slightly modified the method suggested by Neto et al. to capture this 'broad' definition of causality. We apologize for omitting this important information from the original submission. We now added a detailed description of the methodology and alterations from Neto et al. to the subsection headed \u201cGEMOT stage III: Refine module (validate drivers). We also added a new simulation study (new <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, subsection \u201cCausality testing\u2014performance evaluation\u201d, legend for <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2</a>), which shows that in comparison to the compared methods (Neto et al. and Lee et al.), GEMOT attained improved accuracy in our relevant case of a broad-sense definition of causality. We now clarify this in the Methods section."

In the third stage of the GEMOT algorithm, GEMOT aims to identify the groups of traits that share causal drivers within the given tripartite modules. Such identification can also be performed by constructing a detailed network within a module (using existing methods) and using this solution to identify the desired group of traits. Notably, our goal was not to better construct any given network. Rather, we aimed to develop scalable methodology for the identification of the shared drivers of the module's traits, which can scale to the large tripartite modules we found in real mouse data (with a typical size of over 100 candidate transcripts and 2-40 traits in the identified tripartite modules). According to our observations, the accuracy of the existing methods dropped drastically with an increased number of components, and had an unrealistic running time for our BXD modules. This led us to develop an alternative methodology in GEMOT phase III for identifying the players behind the group of traits without a full reconstruction of the network. However, the GEMOT pipeline is general and existing network reconstruction methods may be used in phase III of the pipeline, alongside or instead of our suggested phase-III approach. We now clarify these points in the Introduction, Results and Methods sections."

We have revised the text in the Introduction, Results , and Discussion sections to clarify these points. Second, in the revised manuscript, we use simulations to demonstrate the advantages of GEMOT over various existing methods (network construction: Neto 2010, Hageman 2011, Wang 2014; grouping methods: <a href=\"#bib52\">Shi et al. 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">Gat-Viks et al. 2013</a>) for the goal of identifying groups of traits that share the same causal transcripts, comparing both running time and accuracy. In addition, we clarify the differences from existing causality testing approaches, including a comparative simulation study. We address the simulation studies in detail in response to comment 1, above. Third, we emphasize that the GEMOT pipeline is general and different existing methods may be used as subroutines within the GEMOT pipeline. For example, network construction methods may be applied to construct the sub-networks within the tripartite modules; existing causality-testing methods may be used to identify the driver genes; existing biclustering approaches may be utilized to identify the bipartite modules.
