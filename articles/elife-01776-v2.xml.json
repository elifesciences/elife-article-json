We describe a novel fundamental level of transcriptional control of <i>COX-2</i> expression.

Upon induction of <i>COX-2</i> expression, the lncRNA associates with p50, a repressive subunit of NF-\u03baB, and occludes it from the COX-2 promoter, potentially facilitating interaction with activation-competent NF-\u03baB p65/p50 dimers. This enables recruitment of the p300 histone acetyltransferase, a domain-wide increase in histone acetylation and assembly of RNA Polymerase II initiation complexes.

Using primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and a PMA-driven human monocyte-macrophage differentiation system, we demonstrate that a nuclear antisense long non-coding RNA PACER (<b>P</b>50-<b>A</b>ssociated <b>C</b>OX-2 <b>E</b>xtragenic <b>R</b>NA) is expressed in the upstream region of COX-2 and functions to directly sequester the repressive NF-\u03baB p50 subunit from the COX-2 promoter. This facilitates the recruitment of p300 histone acetyltransferase and a domain-wide increase in chromatin accessibility, as well as assembly of RNA Polymerase II pre-initiation complexes. We also show that PACER expression is controlled by two CTCF/cohesin complexes assembled in the 5\u2032 UTR region and at a distal upstream site. CTCF/cohesin induces lncRNA expression by establishing a chromatin domain marked by increased H3K4 methylation, H4K8 acetylation and decreased H4K20 trimethylation, thus creating a permissive chromatin environment and protecting the COX-2 regulatory region from surrounding repressive chromatin. These findings offer unexpected insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation by CTCF/cohesin and by lncRNA-mediated repressor eviction."

Our search failed to identify lncRNAs within the COX-2 coding region, so we examined the region upstream of the COX-2 transcription start site. This region contains numerous putative binding sites for transcription factors but no additional annotated genes. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using antibodies directed against RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II), which revealed high levels of RNAP II as far as \u223c1 kb upstream of the COX-2 transcribed region. Intriguingly, we detected a peak of RNAP II binding at approximately \u22120.45 kb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). RNAP II molecules in this region contained C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation on serine 5 as demonstrated by ChIPs with antibodies recognizing Ser-P RNAP II specifically (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These findings suggested that an additional RNAP II promoter was located \u223c300 bp upstream of the COX-2 promoter, potentially driving expression of an unidentified species of extragenic RNA."

To determine the directionality of transcription, we used strand specific RT-qPCR. When cDNA synthesis was primed with either of the \u2018sense\u2019 oligos (which detect antisense transcripts), contiguous transcripts were detected extending roughly up to \u22120.3\u22120.4 kb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). By contrast, \u2018anti-sense\u2019 oligos did not produce detectable signals within the upstream region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) in contrast to positive amplification within the coding region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These experiments document the existence of a contiguous antisense transcript originating at approximately \u22120.3 kb upstream of the COX-2 mRNA start site. To determine the exact 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the transcript, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was employed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). 3\u2019 RACE repeatedly showed that a polyA tail is added after position \u22121022, consistent with the presence of a classical polyadenylation signal AAUAAA at position \u2212999 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Sequencing of the 5\u2032 ends showed a variety of positions (from \u2212257 to \u2212332) indicating that alternative start sites are used by RNA Polymerase (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This is consistent with the absence of a TATA box around the transcription start site of this novel RNA. Given that our qPCR analysis showed the presence of transcripts extending up to \u22121.5\u22122 kb upstream, we cannot exclude the existence of additional species of ncRNA within the COX-2 upstream region.

Constructs containing the ncRNA promoter but lacking the mRNA promoter were highly active as compared to the promoterless empty plasmid.

Together, CTCF and cohesin form a complex that regulates a variety of chromatin-related functions such as inter-chromosomal interactions, enhancer blocking and insulation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Merkenschlager and Odom, 2013</a>). We thus investigated whether cohesin and CTCF bind to the same locations within the COX-2 upstream region in HMECs, using ChIP-qPCR with antibodies recognizing CTCF and cohesin subunit Rad21 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). We found that CTCF and cohesin strongly bind to the \u22122.5-kb site, whereas the promoter site is also recognized by both proteins, albeit to a lesser extent, especially in the case of Rad21. ChIP-qPCR experiments with other known CTCF interactors, such as B23/nucleophosmin, Topoisomerase II\u03b2, PARP-1 and, C23/nucleolin, failed to reveal specific binding in the COX-2 upstream region (data not shown)."

We tend to believe that the qPCR reflects the actual situation, because of its quantitative nature, as opposed to hybridization-based detection in the case of ChIP-on-chip. The most probable cause of the discrepancy is the fact that the COX-2 promoter region contains a CpG island extending from position +245 to \u2212525, and thus probes covering this region contained an unusually high GC content, which could skew hybridization efficiency producing aberrantly strong and wide signal peak."

To this end, we used small molecule RNA interference to transiently ablate the expression of CTCF or cohesin in HMECs. CTCF knockdown reduced COX-2 mRNA to \u223c20%, and the COX-2 protein to almost undetectable levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). These effects appear to be direct, because not only CTCF mRNA and protein levels were decreased by siRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>) but also CTCF binding to both promoter and distal \u22122.5 kb sites in the <i>COX-2</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Similar to CTCF, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the cohesin subunit SMC3 reduced COX-2 mRNA levels, albeit to a lesser extent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Importantly, knockdown of CTCF-reduced expression of extragenic RNA to practically undetectable levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This means that CTCF exerts more global control over the <i>COX-2</i> locus by regulating both mRNA and ncRNA expression from two distinct promoters. This prompted us to investigate whether CTCF controls COX-2 expression by creating a specialized chromatin neighborhood within the putative CTCF/cohesin chromatin loop. To do this, we performed ChIP-qPCR experiments to analyze the chromatin modification status in the COX-2 promoter region. Interestingly, the effects of CTCF knockdown on several activation and repression-associated histone marks extended to \u223c2.5 kb upstream. High levels of H3K4me2 and me3 showed a local maximum at approximately \u22120.7 kb and were reduced twofold to threefold across the entire \u223c3 kb domain in the absence of CTCF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). H4K8 acetylation levels extended even further upstream, and were reduced significantly by CTCF knockdown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). A repressive mark H4K20me3 had a more localized pattern, with two discernible peaks at \u22122.5 kb and approximately \u22121.2 kb. This modification was increased at \u22122.5 kb upon CTCF knockdown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). No significant changes were observed for H3K9me3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>), or H4K12-Ac, H2AZ, and unmodified H3 (data not shown). Taken together, these experiments indicate that CTCF regulates the <i>COX-2</i> locus by establishing and maintaining an open chromatin domain demarcated by two CTCF/cohesin complexes; inducing extragenic transcription of PACER within this domain; and activating COX-2 mRNA expression."

To explore this, we first performed transient knockdown experiments using siRNA specific to the PACER sequence. Indeed, siRNA-mediated reduction of PACER decreased COX-2 mRNA levels to a comparable extent as observed with CTCF knockdowns in HMECs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and COX-2 protein was reduced to negligible levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

However, COX-2 is also expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which are known to accelerate tumor formation and metastasis in breast and other cancer types (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pollard, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Smyth, 2011</a>). We therefore decided to further examine lncRNA-mediated regulation of <i>COX-2</i> expression in the human monocyte/macrophage cell line U937, as these cells offer unique advantages as a model system to study gene regulation. U937 monocytes can be differentiated into macrophages with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and <i>COX-2</i> expression can be efficiently induced in U937 macrophages with a variety of stimuli, including LPS (schematically shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arias-Negrete et al., 1995</a>)."

U937-sh-lncRNA monocytes showed no detectable COX-2 mRNA or lncRNA expression, as did control monocytes carrying shRNA directed against the Luciferase gene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Upon PMA-induced differentiation, both COX-2 mRNA and PACER expression were strongly induced in control U937 cells. By contrast, in PACER-knockdown cells, PMA induced lncRNA expression to much lower levels compared to control cells, and, as a result, COX-2 mRNA levels were also markedly reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Induction of PMA-differentiated macrophages with LPS greatly up-regulated <i>COX-2</i> expression in control macrophages over a 6-hr time course, with the highest levels of expression reaching a plateau at \u223c2 hr post induction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). In knockdown cells, the effect of LPS was severely attenuated, with COX-2 mRNA reaching \u223c60% of maximal control levels 4 hr post-induction, but not abolished, consistent with the fact that PACER expression was also up-regulated during LPS treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Finally, Western blotting in whole cell extracts confirmed PACER-mediated effects on COX-2 protein levels both in PMA differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) and during LPS induction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Interestingly, PACER knockdown appears to greatly reduce COX-2 protein levels upon PMA stimulation of monocytes but only transiently affect COX-2 levels upon LPS-induction. This suggests that PACER plays an essential role early in <i>COX-2</i> gene activation during monocyte differentiation into macrophages by controlling the critical transition from a transcriptionally inactive locus to one competent for basal transcription."

This distribution is very different from that of COX-2 mRNA, of which around 50% is found in the cytoplasm. This observation suggests that PACER performs its functions in the nucleus. Small amounts of PACER found in the cytoplasm likely reflect a minor leakage of nucleoplasm into the cytoplasmic fraction, as the same is observed for control intronic sequences (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>)."

By contrast, histone H3 acetylation was clearly affected by the loss of PACER. Levels of H3Ac in non-induced macrophages were considerably reduced at \u22121.25 kb and \u22122.5 kb in shPACER-cells and the LPS-induced increase in H3Ac was markedly attenuated compared to control macrophages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

NF-\u03baB-mediated induction of <i>COX-2</i> has been previously shown to involve p300 recruitment to DNA (<a href=\"#bib77\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kang et al., 2006</a>). This raised the possibility that PACER could interact with a member of the NF-\u03baB family. Indeed, RIP experiments demonstrated that p50, the small subunit of NF-\u03baB, interacts directly with the lncRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). We also detected p50 in RNA pulldown experiments using the COX-2 lncRNA but not its inverted control (data not shown). By contrast, PACER did not interact with the NF-\u03baB large subunit p65/RelA by RIP or with CTCF and control SNRNP70 proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Binding of p50 to the lncRNA could be detected using amplicons located at multiple positions within the PACER sequence (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), demonstrating that p50 interacts with full length, intact PACER. Finally, binding to PACER was specific, because p50 did not interact with control U1 snRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Given these results, we investigated whether association of p50 with the COX-2 promoter was affected by knockdown of PACER using ChIP-qPCR. We detected low level binding of p50 to COX-2 at position \u22120.25 kb in control macrophages before and after LPS induction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This is in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that p50 levels do not change in response to LPS (<a href=\"#bib55\">Saccani et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Saccani et al., 2006</a>). In untreated PACER-knockdown macrophages, p50 is found at the \u22120.25 kb site in the COX-2 promoter. However upon LPS stimulation, which normally induces PACER expression, levels of bound p50 increase dramatically when PACER is decreased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This indicates that PACER ensures low p50 association with the COX-2 promoter during activation of the gene."

We therefore verified whether p50 might repress <i>COX-2</i> transcription in the absence of stimuli that normally induce COX-2 expression. To do this, we established p50-knockdown U937 monocyte lines using lentiviral delivery and measured COX-2 levels in KD cells compared to the control U937. Indeed, knockdown of p50 led to a marked increase of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). As expected, the increase is particularly prominent in undifferentiated U937 monocytes and unstimulated monocytes, whereas upon LPS stimulation COX-2 levels are similar in wt and p50 KD macrophages. These results demonstrate that the small NF-\u03baB subunit p50 by itself functions as a repressor of <i>COX-2</i> \u2018basal\u2019, non-induced transcription. To demonstrate the distinct role of p65 subunit on COX-2 expression, we performed lentiviral-mediated knockdown of p65 in U937 cells and measured COX-2 expression in U937 monocytes, macrophages, and during LPS induction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>). Expectedly, p65 knockdown had no influence on \u2018basal\u2019 expression of COX-2 mRNA or protein in monocytes or non-induced macrophages (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, left and 6H, lanes 1,2 and 6,7).

While the activities of small ncRNA species have been well-characterized, the roles of long ncRNAs in gene regulation have been deciphered in only several cases. The predominant model proposes that lncRNAs serve to guide enzymatic complexes to carry out chromatin modifications at specific genes, such as HOTAIR that recruits PRC2 and LSD1 complexes to silence <i>HOXD</i> genes and other distant loci (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tsai et al., 2010</a>); HOTTIP that recruits MLL1 to activate transcription of <i>HOXA</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wang et al., 2011</a>); and Evf2 ncRNA that recruits the transcription factor DLX2 to activate expression of the <i>Dlx6</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bond et al., 2009</a>). Even in the vicinity of the <i>COX-2</i> locus, a recent study identified a species of lncRNA that interacts with the RNA binding proteins hnRNP A/B and hnRNP A2/B1, which might act as transcriptional regulators for a variety of immune-related genes but, interestingly, not <i>COX-2</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carpenter et al., 2013</a>)."

PACER directly interacts with p50, which can form both active heterodimers with p65/RelA during the normal course of NF-\u03baB pathway activation, and inactive p50/p50 homodimers which lack transcription activation domains present in p65/RelA. The repressor role of p50 at <i>COX-2</i> is consistent with previous studies showing that p50 homodimers inhibit LPS-induced activation of the <i>TNF\u03b1</i> gene in macrophages and other cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Saccani et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kastenbauer and Ziegler-Heitbrock, 1999</a>). Moreover, tumor-associated macrophages, which are refractory to LPS exhibit strong overexpression of p50 and fail to induce TNF\u03b1 expression despite normal levels of p65/RelA and its ability to re-localize to the nucleus upon LPS treatment (<a href=\"#bib56\">Saccani et al., 2006</a>). Importantly, the molecular mechanism by which PACER regulates COX-2 expression does not directly involve the p65/RelA because PACER does not physically interact with this subunit, and the role of p65/RelA is only evident in the induction stage of LPS-mediated COX-2 expression, while PACER mainly affects \u2018basal\u2019, unstimulated COX-2 transcription."

Similar doublets of CTCF sites, with one located several kilobases upstream and the other within the transcribed region, are found in many genes (data not shown), which could suggest a specific mode of gene regulation by CTCF. We speculate that such doublets participate in establishing a \u2018promoter-proximal\u2019 open chromatin domain, possibly through long range chromatin tethering/looping mediated by two CTCF/cohesin complexes bound to distal sites. Both the enhancer and promoter elements would be positioned inside one chromatin loop, effectively insulated by CTCF/cohesin-mediated boundaries from the surrounding environment, which could restrict the action of enhancers to the appropriate promoter."

                        "text": "Deciphering the mechanisms of <i>COX-2</i> gene regulation is of great clinical interest. COX-2 activity has been shown to be instrumental in the development of several types of cancer, including colon, breast, and prostate (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yap et al., 2010</a>). For this reason, targeting COX-2 activity with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or agents designed to specifically block COX-2 activity have been approved for therapeutic use (<a href=\"#bib57\">Salinas et al., 2007</a>). However, because these drugs have significant off-target side effects, other strategies that specifically modulate <i>COX-2</i> transcription could be an attractive alternative approach. For example, <i>COX-2</i> downregulation in early stages of tumorigenesis by interfering with PACER-induced COX-2 expression would be predicted to have therapeutic benefits. In addition, <i>COX-2</i> silencing has been observed in numerous analyses of tumor specimens and cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#bib43\">Murata et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Toyota et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Meng et al., 2011</a>). It is attractive to speculate that re-activating <i>COX-2</i> expression in advanced stages of cancer by modulating PACER expression would increase COX-2-mediated local tissue mobilization and inflammation, consequently leading to more efficient tumor clearing by immune cells."

The manuscript reports the characterization of the lncRNA dubbed PACER, which originates from the upstream region of the COX-2 gene in the antisense direction. It is demonstrated that PACER positively regulates COX-2 expression. Mechanistically, PACER promotes histone modifications associated with gene activation and RNAPII association with the COX2 promoter region. PACER binds to the DNA binding protein p50, and it is proposed that this binding leads to gene activation by favoring formation of active p50-p65 NFKB heterodimers, which in turn would drive COX2 transcription. The reviewers agreed that these results merit publication in a high-impact journal such as <i>eLife</i>, but they also concurred in that additional work is required to strengthen the main conclusions of this interesting paper."

There is a discrepancy between the ChIP-on-chip and ChIP-qPCR analysis for CTCF binding sites. In the ChIP-on-chip, one sees a clear enrichment of CTCF binding at least to -500bp, which is not confirmed by the qPCR. Also, the peak for CTCF binding around TSS is much more pronounced than the one around -2.5kb. Again, this is not recapitulated in the ChIP-qPCR. In addition, the claim that Rad21 binds around the TSS along with CTCF is not substantiated by the ChIP presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Fig 2D</a>, especially if one takes into account the IgG background that differs between different amplicons.

Cytoplasmic RNAs are found in the nuclear fractions to some extent, likely because a fraction of mature RNA remains within the spliceosome/nuclear export complexes and co-purifies with the nuclear fractions, this is clearly visible for COX-2 mRNA but also actin mRNA. Conversely, small amounts of nuclear RNAs are found in the cytoplasmic fraction. This is likely to occur during biochemical separation of fractions, where small molecules are known to passively leak out through nuclear pores.

These results clearly indicate that the role of p65 at the COX-2 promoter is confined to the induction phase, because in non-induced macrophages the knockdown had no effects upon COX-2 expression, contrary to what we observed for p50 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> vs 6E). This is to be expected because, while p50 remains bound to the COX-2 promoter in non-induced conditions, p65 is retained in the cytoplasm by I\u03baB complexes [Gilmore, T.D., <i>Introduction to NF-kappaB: players, pathways, perspectives.</i> Oncogene, 2006. 25(51): p. 6680-4]. Only upon activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway p65 relocates into the nucleus and activates its target genes [Gilmore, T.D., <i>Introduction to NF-kappaB: players, pathways, perspectives.</i> Oncogene, 2006. 25(51): p. 6680-4]. Contrary to this, the activation role of PACER on COX-2 expression is evident both in non-induced macrophages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4DF</a>) and in HMECs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4AB</a>). In addition, RIP experiments suggest that PACER does not contact p65 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We therefore believe that the role of PACER is independent of p65; as PACER occludes p50, effectively inactivating it as a repressor, and allows activators (p65 in the case of LPS stimulation in macrophages, and possibly other transcription factors in the case of HMECs) to induce RNAP II recruitment and mRNA transcription."

We attempted to perform similar analyses using the antibodies that were used by other investigators, including, but not limited to, sc-372X from Santa Cruz or Ab7970 from Abcam, all without success. We consistently observed background signals at COX-2, as well as at other regions where p65 binding was also expected, including numerous \u201cpositive control\u201d regions that exhibited particularly strong signals for p65 in previous studies (TNFa, IL-2, CCL5 and CSF5). Since our laboratory possesses extensive expertise in ChIP and these types of experiments are performed routinely with success, we were forced to conclude that currently available antibody lots do not permit us to perform p65 ChIP experiments. However, given that the role of p65 in the context of COX-2 expression has been studied extensively [Schmedtje, J.F., Jr., et al., <i>Hypoxia induces cyclooxygenase-2 via the NF-kappaB p65 transcription factor in human vascular endothelial cells.</i> J Biol Chem, 1997. 272(1): p. 601-8; D'Acquisto, F., et al., <i>Involvement of NF-kappaB in the regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression in LPS-stimulated J774 macrophages.</i> FEBS Lett, 1997. 418(1-2): p. 175-8; Shishodia, S. and B.B.
