Chief among these is the heat shock response (HSR), which is assumed to respond to unfolded proteins in the cytosol and nucleus alike. In this study, we probe this axiom further using engineered proteins called \u2018destabilizing domains\u2019, whose folding state we control with a small molecule. The sudden appearance of unfolded protein in mammalian cells elicits a robust transcriptional response, which is distinct from the HSR and other known pathways that respond to unfolded proteins. The cellular response to unfolded protein is strikingly different in the nucleus and the cytosol, although unfolded protein in either compartment engages the p53 network. This response provides cross-protection during subsequent proteotoxic stress, suggesting that it is a central component of protein quality control networks, and like the HSR, is likely to influence the initiation and progression of human pathologies."

Chief among these is the heat shock response (HSR), which is assumed to respond to unfolded proteins in the cytosol and nucleus alike. In this study, we probe this axiom further using engineered proteins called \u2018destabilizing domains\u2019, whose folding state we control with a small molecule. The sudden appearance of unfolded protein in mammalian cells elicits a robust transcriptional response, which is distinct from the HSR and other known pathways that respond to unfolded proteins. The cellular response to unfolded protein is strikingly different in the nucleus and the cytosol, although unfolded protein in either compartment engages the p53 network. This response provides cross-protection during subsequent proteotoxic stress, suggesting that it is a central component of protein quality control networks, and like the HSR, is likely to influence the initiation and progression of human pathologies."

In 2006, researchers developed a technique that can be used to switch a protein between a folded and an unfolded state. Now, Miyazaki et al.\u2014including several of the researchers involved in the 2006 work\u2014have used this technique to investigate how a cell responds when a single protein unfolds. The sudden appearance of the unfolded protein increased the expression of several genes. Some of these genes are part of known pathways, but the majority were not known to respond to protein-folding stress. The cell also reacts differently depending on whether the unfolded protein is made in the cell nucleus, or the cytosol (the fluid that surrounds the nucleus and other cellular components)."

Cells that activated this network were also better able to protect themselves from further stress. This newly discovered pathway is likely to play an important role in monitoring the quality of the proteins made in the cell. The next step involves identifying the cellular sensor(s) that recognize the unfolded protein as well as the transcription factors that are responsible for increasing gene expression. With a more complete picture of this new response, it will be possible to knock-out specific pathways to determine their roles."

This is a difficult balancing act under ideal conditions, but cells are often not so lucky. Rather, sources of stress ranging from radiation to exogenous chemical and biological agents and even chemical byproducts of primary metabolism can cause damage to critical molecules (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balaban et al., 2005</a>). To counteract these insults, cells have evolved surveillance mechanisms to detect damage, allowing them time to repair the damage or to otherwise adapt to stress (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stoecklin and Bukau, 2013</a>). For example, the integrity of the genome is important for cellular viability, and it is closely monitored (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</a>). When DNA damage is detected, one or more cellular checkpoints are activated to allow the cell time to repair the damage, or in the case of multicellular organisms, initiate apoptosis if the damage is too severe to repair (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</a>). Similarly, the spindle assembly checkpoint ensures that mitosis does not proceed until each sister chromatid is productively engaged by microtubules at its kinetochore (<a href=\"#bib19\">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</a>). Defects in either of these quality control (QC) surveillance mechanisms lead to genomic instability and frequently drive human pathologies such as cancer (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sperka et al., 2012</a>)."

In the past several decades, studies in organisms from bacteria to humans have revealed that cells broadly monitor protein QC during translation as well as after mature proteins have entered the proteome (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wolff et al., 2014</a>). Damaged proteins are typically degraded by either the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) or through autophagy, although we still lack a clear understanding of how cells detect damaged proteins and how they decide to either refold or degrade these substrates if refolding is not productive (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wong and Cuervo, 2010</a>). However, it is clear that disruptions to the protein-folding environment trigger cellular stress responses that mitigate the effects of the misfolded or unfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vabulas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nargund et al., 2012</a>). Not surprisingly, the inability to mount these stress responses is correlated with decreased cellular fitness, especially under conditions of protein-folding stress (<a href=\"#bib44\">Morimoto, 2011</a>). Failure to refold or degrade unfolded or misfolded proteins is detrimental to the health of cells and organisms and is linked to a multitude of human diseases (<a href=\"#bib43\">Morimoto, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Knowles et al., 2014</a>)."

The HSR provided the first molecular mechanism for a cellular response to proteotoxic stress, in this instance presumably triggered by thermally unfolded proteins. A decade passed before Walter and colleagues discovered a second unfolded protein response activated by misfolded proteins in the secretory pathway (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cox et al., 1993</a>). This unfolded protein response, called the erUPR (Unfolded Protein Response), induces the transcription of genes involved in helping proteins fold or otherwise restoring the secretory pathway to a state that is conducive to protein homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib64\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). The erUPR also resets protein translation, reducing the synthesis of additional proteins when the environment is not conducive to proper folding (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harding et al., 2000</a>). More recently, Ron and Haynes have characterized a conceptually similar unfolded protein response in mitochondria (mitoUPR) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Haynes et al., 2007</a>)."

We used engineered proteins whose folding state can be controlled using a cell-permeable small molecule to rapidly create a single unfolded protein in mammalian cells, and herein, we report that the appearance of unfolded protein elicits a co-ordinated transcriptional response that is distinct from the HSR and the other UPRs. Cells that trigger this response are more resistant than unstressed cells when challenged with other protein-folding stressors. Finally, the creation of unfolded protein in the nucleus elicits a response that is distinct from the response to unfolded cytosolic protein."

We started by screening a library of genes encoding mutants of the human FKBP12 protein to identify mutants whose metabolic stability could be regulated by a high-affinity ligand called Shield-1 (S1). These mutants are called destabilizing domains (DDs). In the absence of S1, the DDs are ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome, whose processivity ensures the degradation of any fused partner proteins (<a href=\"#bib18\">Egeler et al., 2011</a>). We have similarly engineered <i>Escherichia coli</i> dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) and the ligand-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor to behave as DDs using ligands such as trimethoprim and tamoxifen to regulate protein stability (<a href=\"#bib30\">Iwamoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Miyazaki et al., 2012</a>).

NMR spectroscopy of several FKBP-derived DDs revealed that their capacity to induce degradation in cells correlates with their degree of unfolding in vitro. Complementary urea denaturation studies revealed that DDs sample unfolded conformations to different extents, but all of the DDs are strongly stabilized by the addition of S1. These mechanistic studies suggest that DDs extensively sample an unfolded conformational state when expressed in cells. Importantly, this unfolded conformation does not irreversibly aggregate, but rather equilibrates between unfolded and folded states, permitting S1 to stabilize the folded conformation. Unfolded DDs are recognized by the cellular QC machinery and targeted for degradation through ubiquitylation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Egeler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chu et al., 2013</a>). However, S1 binding prevents the DDs from sampling the unfolded state, thus, rescuing DDs from degradation. Therefore, we use S1 as a small molecule switch to toggle DDs expressed in cells between folded and unfolded states with a high degree of temporal control."

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to select those cells expressing high amounts of DD-GFP fusion protein. We maintained the stabilizing S1 ligand in culture media at all times to avoid either stressing the cells with unfolded protein or forcing the cells to adapt to the presence of unfolded protein. To initiate the stress, S1 was withdrawn to create the unfolded DD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We harvested cells 45, 135, and 405 min following S1 withdrawal, isolated mRNA, and analyzed changes in the transcriptome using mRNA-seq.

When analyzing the responsive genes in an unbiased fashion, relying solely on the statistical significance of the observed changes, we see no such concordance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013E</a>). Another way to approach the issue is to look at groups of genes that are known to share a common function. For example, cells experiencing proteotoxic stress might respond by producing more proteasomes to rid the cell of unfolded protein (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vilchez et al., 2013</a>). When we looked at 39 genes that encode proteasome subunits, we found that the appearance of the unfolded DD causes changes in 16 of these genes, all of them up-regulated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). The HSR induces changes in only 3 genes, all of them down-regulated. The limited degree of overlap between these two sets of induced genes leads us to conclude that these two cellular stress responses are mechanistically distinct, though some degree of overlap cannot be excluded."

DNA damage is well known to activate p53 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kenzelmann Broz et al., 2013</a>), so we triggered the appearance of the unfolded DD and then immunoblotted cell lysates for various markers of DNA damage including phospho-KAP1, phospho-RNA32, phospho-Chk1, and \u03b3-H2AX (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). None of these hallmarks of DNA damage were significantly induced, suggesting that the DD-GFP-expressing cells were not experiencing DNA damage. ATM and ATR are kinases that are essential for cells to respond to DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</a>), so we used chemical inhibitors of ATM and ATR to assess the potential role of these kinases in the cellular response to the appearance of unfolded DD (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hickson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Couch et al., 2013</a>). Neither inhibitor affected the cellular response to the unfolded DD, suggesting that DNA damage signaling mediated by ATM or ATR is not responsible for the increased levels of p53. Oxidative stress can also induce p53, so we used CM-H2DCFDA as a sensor for reactive oxygen species in DD-mCherry-expressing cells upon withdrawal of S1. We observed no significant signal by analytical flow cytometry upon creation of the unfolded DD (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

However, increased mRNA levels were not affected for some of the responsive genes including <i>Ubc</i>, <i>Zfand2a</i>, and <i>Gclm</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These results suggest the involvement of other factors during the response to unfolded DD. Since we see induction of HS proteins and oxidative stress genes, we performed used RNAi to knockdown <i>Hsf1</i> and <i>Nrf2</i>, two transcription factors that mediate cellular responses to HS and oxidative stress. Cells were treated with siRNA reagents to knockdown these two genes and RT-qPCR was used to quantify mRNA levels of two dozen genes that are induced by the unfolded DD. Although most of the responsive genes were unaffected by knockdown of HSF1 and NRF2, loss of these factors did affect the induction of some responsive genes. Loss of Hsf1 attenuated the induction of several HS proteins (<i>Hspa1b, Hsph1, Dnajb1</i>) and loss of Nrf2 affected the induction of oxidative stress genes (<i>Hmox, Osgin, Sqstm1/p62</i>), respectively. These studies are far from comprehensive, but we can conclude that the cellular response to unfolded DD involves several stress-responsive transcription factors (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We created unfolded DD by withdrawing S1 for 45, 135, or 405 min.

We observed that the amount of time cells were exposed to the unfolded DD inversely correlated with replicative fitness. Creating unfolded DD for a period as brief as 45 min caused a significant and reproducible reduction in the population of DD-GFP cells, and 405 min of exposure to unfolded DD caused the original ratio of 61:39 (DD-GFP:control cells) to fall to 51:49. Cells that express threefold lower amounts of the DD do not experience this replicative fitness defect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In attempt to identify the source of this replicative fitness defect, we used RNAi to knockdown p53, Hsf1, and Nrf2 in separate populations of cells. Loss of p53 reduces the replicative phenotype exhibited by cells challenged with the unfolded DD, whereas loss of Hsf1 or Nrf2 did not reveal any detectable effect in cycling cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>).

Culturing eukaryotic cells at elevated temperatures or in the presence of hydrogen peroxide affects not only proteins but virtually every molecule in the cell (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zunino et al., 2001</a>). Nevertheless, these perturbations have enabled many insights into the HSR and other protein-folding stress responses. Studies of the erUPR in the secretory pathway rely heavily upon the use of small molecules such as tunicamycin, thapsigargin, or dithiothreitol, and ethidium bromide is used to rapidly stress the protein-folding environment within mitochondria. Genetic methods to introduce stress are more specific but not as acute. Transgenes encoding folding-defective mutants of cellular proteins (e.g., CPY*) have been valuable for studies of protein folding and trafficking (<a href=\"#bib33\">Knop et al., 1996</a>). However, there are few examples of mutant proteins being used to activate the HSR, despite the conventional wisdom that the HSR responds to unfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wolff et al., 2014</a>). Mutant proteins that are prone to misfold affect cellular fitness when constitutively expressed (<a href=\"#bib21\">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2011</a>). However, the chronic nature of these genetically encoded stressors allows cells to adapt to their presence, rendering these perturbations unsuitable for studies of cellular responses that are induced by acute stress."

Additionally, DDs are maintained in a metabolically stable, folded conformation when bound to their stabilizing ligands, but withdrawal of the stabilizing ligand initiates the rapid unfolding of the DD (<a href=\"#bib18\">Egeler et al., 2011</a>).

HS will cause many proteins to unfold, and the overall amount of unfolded protein will likely be higher than can be attained using the unfolded DD. Additionally, HS causes hundreds or thousands of different proteins to unfold. This variety of stressors may present unique challenges for cellular QC surveillance pathways.

At 37\u00b0C, the p53 core domain unfolds in vitro with a half-time of only 9 min, so it is possible that p53 is unable to maintain its folded, functional conformation when cells are exposed to the higher temperatures used to initiate the HSR (<a href=\"#bib20\">Friedler et al., 2003</a>). If one were able to generate large amounts of unfolded protein at 37\u00b0C (i.e., simulate the HSR under standard culture conditions), p53 might be involved in the response. Indeed, treatment of mammalian cells with proteasome inhibitors, which causes misfolded proteins to accumulate, leads to increased p53 levels and the induction of p53-dependent proteins such as <i>Mdm2</i> and <i>Cdkn1</i>/p21 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lopes et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pandit and Gartel, 2011</a>)."

This unique experimental feature revealed that a subset of the genes induced by unfolded DD respond more strongly to nucleus-localized unfolded DD, whereas other responsive genes are more sensitive to unfolded cytosolic protein. The creation of unfolded protein in the nucleus induces primarily p53-dependent genes, implying that p53 (either directly or indirectly) may be responsible for protein QC surveillance in the nucleus. Gardner has characterized a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase in yeast called San1p that appears to recognize and ubiquitylate unfolded or misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rosenbaum et al., 2011</a>). Although SAN1 orthologs have not been found in higher eukaryotes, metazoans may likewise have evolved mechanisms to perform protein QC surveillance in the nucleus. The fact that p53 responds to the appearance of unfolded protein, especially its sensitivity to unfolded protein in the nucleus, suggests that p53 may play a central role in nuclear protein QC surveillance in addition to its role as the guardian of the genome. In support of this hypothesis, Sawa and co-workers have reported that mutant huntingtin protein binds directly to p53, leading to higher p53 levels and the induction of p53-responsive genes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bae et al., 2005</a>)."

Several chaperones, proteasome subunits, ubiquitin genes, and redox-responsive genes fall into this category. This result suggests that there are one or more protein QC surveillance pathways that monitor unfolded protein in a compartment-specific manner."

We know that newly unfolded DD is rapidly ubiquitylated, which might deplete, at least temporarily, cellular levels of ubiquitin. One potential mechanism to initiate the cellular response to unfolded DD might include a futile cycle involving the production and rapid degradation of a transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barton and Sontag, 2013</a>). When conditions favor homeostasis, the surveillance transcription factor would be constitutively ubiquitylated and degraded. However, under conditions of proteotoxic stress, when ubiquitin becomes unavailable, the surveillance transcription factor would be stabilized and become competent to regulate the expression of genes involved in restoring homeostasis to the cell."

Similarly, the Nrf2 transcription factor is degraded by the E3 ligase Keap1 until oxidative stress disables Keap1, allowing Nrf2 levels to rise and regulate redox-responsive stress genes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kobayashi et al., 2004</a>). A similar mechanism might explain the cellular response to unfolded DD, with p53 and other as yet unknown transcription factors in the roles of surveillance factors. However, one would expect the pool of cellular ubiquitin to rapidly partition between the nucleus and cytosol. Assuming rapid ubiquitin equilibration, the subcellular location of the unfolded protein should not affect the cellular response. The cellular response should be initiated by either cytosolic or nuclear unfolded protein, and the ensuing transcriptional programs should be identical. This is not what we observe, so it seems unlikely that ubiquitin depletion alone triggers the transcriptional response to unfolded DD."

There is evidence in humans that these surveillance systems become less effective with age, leading to higher levels of aberrantly folded proteins, particularly in post-mitotic cells such as neurons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Douglas and Dillin, 2010</a>). Protein misfolding and aggregation is correlated with, and in some cases likely causative of, a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases (<a href=\"#bib43\">Morimoto, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Knowles et al., 2014</a>). It is well known that cells try to rescue aberrantly folded proteins by refolding them using chaperones or destroy them via the proteasome or autophagy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hartl et al., 2011</a>). However, we are only beginning to understand the basic mechanisms by which cells target cytosolic and nuclear proteins for degradation when the proper folded state cannot be achieved. One of the barriers to progress in this field is the lack of good tools and methods that would allow us to move beyond simple correlations to mechanistically probe the specific relationships between protein folding and the etiology of diseases where protein misfolding has been implicated. The use of the DDs to illuminate a new cellular response used to maintain protein homeostasis highlights how useful these molecular tools can be."

Connections between protein QC surveillance mechanisms and disease are of particular interest, although hints are readily apparent. Mutations in proteins involved in the UPS have been implicated in neurological disease (e.g., Ube3a in Angelman syndrome and Ube3c in autism spectrum disorders) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Greer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">O'Roak et al., 2012</a>). The key sensor in the HSR, Hsf1, has recently been shown to regulate in malignant cancer cells a transcriptional program that is distinct from the program induced by HS (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mendillo et al., 2012</a>). Finally, although a firm mechanistic picture is not yet clear, there is convincing evidence of an inverse correlation between Parkinson's disease and cancer, with a similar pattern becoming clear for Alzheimer's disease and cancer (<a href=\"#bib17\">Driver et al., 2012</a>). The previously unappreciated role of p53 in protein QC surveillance might provide a mechanistic basis for this anticorrelation."

Cells were cultured for an additional 17 hr in S1-containing media and then analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify the ratio of DD-GFP-expressing cells to control cells. To assess protective benefits, we used a similar co-culture experiment to examine the potential for the appearance of the unfolded DD to provide a protective benefit to cells exposed to a second source of proteotoxic stress. Cells expressing DD-GFP were mixed with NIH3T3 cells and co-cultured in the presence of S1. The S1 was either withdrawn for 5 hr to trigger the cellular response or S1 was maintained in the media. At the 5-hr timepoint, a media change was used to re-administer S1 and the cells were cultured for an additional hour. At this point, cells were treated with either vehicle or with a second stress (30 \u00b5M sodium arsenite or 10 \u00b5M MG132), cultured overnight, and analyzed at 24 hr by flow cytometry. Cells that did not experience either stress were defined as the control and the ratio of GFP<sup>+</sup>:GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> cells at the end of the experiment was set to 100. The effects of the various treatments (unfolded DD only, arsenite or MG132 only, or both unfolded DD and arsenite or MG132) were then quantified using by flow cytometry. Expected effect of both stresses was calculated by multiplying the two mean values of either single-stress condition, and the error was computed by error propagation."

They use destabilizing domains regulated by exogenous ligands to cause immediate protein misfolding and turnover via proteasomes when the ligand (Shield 1) is removed from the media. These studies, in principle, add considerably to our understanding of how cells respond to misfolded proteins. Perhaps the strongest aspect presented here is the added temporal regulation that has not previously been possible in studies to study transcriptional adaptations to defective proteostatsis."

Furthermore, they show that the nuclear and cytosolic responses to the rapid accumulation of the unstable DD are different. While the general approach to monitoring cellular responses to misfolded proteins is creative and valuable, there are issues with the interpretation of the results and approach that need to be addressed prior to publication:"

Thus, a consequence of the DD is increased proteasome load, potentially limiting proteasome activity. This mechanism appears to be reflected in the transcriptional profiling. To address this concern, the authors could perform a temporal mRNA-seq analysis of gene expression induced by the addition of proteasome inhibitors, as done for the DD stress, HSR and the erUPR. If the DD stress does mimic a proteasome inhibition (albeit likely a transient inhibition that is resolved following degradation of the accumulated DD), it would provide a mechanism of action to begin to define the transcriptional profile induced under this DD stress."

Do DDs increase chaperone load? Is there activation of known cytosolic stress-responsive transcription factors such as HSF1 (likely for the induction of the cytosolic chaperones identified)? It is very difficult to identify new stress-responsive signaling pathways starting with a transcriptional profile, as proposed in this manuscript, in the absence of more mechanistic data on the type of proteome challenge and/or signaling pathway(s) involved. Without this type of information it is difficult to determine whether the observed transcriptional response reflects a new stress-signaling pathway, a physiologic level of activity of a known stress-signaling pathway, or a combination of multiple stress-signaling pathways activated in response to the unfolded DD. Thus, the claim that the observed transcriptional response in this manuscript reflects a new cUPR is not supported without identification of signaling pathways and/or mechanism of activation for DD induced stress. For instance, the HSR and UPR are largely defined by the transcripts induced by heat shock/tunicamycin in an HSF1/XBP1-dependent manner. While the authors are not expected to define all of the regulators of the described response, it would be helpful to know if it (or what fraction) is regulated by HSF1 (the data are convincing that it is not regulated by XBP1). It would be useful to perform these experiments in the absence of HSF1 (shRNA, CRISPR, deletion cells, etc) and determine if the transcript levels are altered. At least several genes should be examined by qRT-PCR to ensure that the transcripts identified here are not all/mostly regulated by HSF1."

Collectively with the p53 knockdown results, it is clear that the DD activated an orchestrated combination of stress-responsive transcription factors to adapt cellular homeostasis to this specific type of insult. Overall, this is an interesting manuscript that describes how cells response to a specific misfolded protein in the cytosol and nucleus."

My preference is always to show the raw data to provide maximal information to the reader, but I understand the desire to make the figure more \u201cuser-friendly\u201d in this case. The best way to do this would be to calculate the selection coefficient for the cells experiencing the ufDD stress. However, since the appearance of the unfolded DD affects the rate of proliferation of the DD cells, one cannot honestly use the selection coefficient. We could use an \u201capparent selection coefficient\u201d, but that's unacceptable in this case when we know the doubling rate is reduced for ufDD cells. So, in line with their suggestion, we have reformatted the figure to normalize the data to reflect how the percentage of cells that experience the ufDD change with respect to the control cells as a function of time spent challenged with unfolded DD. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> has been modified, as have been the 3 supporting panels showing similar data."
