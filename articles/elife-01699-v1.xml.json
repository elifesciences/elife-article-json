While axonal branching is well described, the mechanisms that control it remain largely unknown. We find that in the <i>Drosophila</i> CNS branches develop through a process of excessive growth followed by pruning. In vivo high-resolution live imaging of developing brains as well as loss and gain of function experiments show that activation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is necessary for branch dynamics and the final branching pattern. Live imaging also reveals that intrinsic asymmetry in EGFR localization regulates the balance between dynamic and static filopodia. Elimination of signaling asymmetry by either loss or gain of EGFR function results in reduced dynamics leading to excessive branch formation. In summary, we propose that the dynamic process of axon branch development is mediated by differential local distribution of signaling receptors."

While axonal branching is well described, the mechanisms that control it remain largely unknown. We find that in the <i>Drosophila</i> CNS branches develop through a process of excessive growth followed by pruning. In vivo high-resolution live imaging of developing brains as well as loss and gain of function experiments show that activation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is necessary for branch dynamics and the final branching pattern. Live imaging also reveals that intrinsic asymmetry in EGFR localization regulates the balance between dynamic and static filopodia. Elimination of signaling asymmetry by either loss or gain of EGFR function results in reduced dynamics leading to excessive branch formation. In summary, we propose that the dynamic process of axon branch development is mediated by differential local distribution of signaling receptors."

An extended neurite network enables a single neuron to process information from multiple input cells and to relay that information to a wide range of targets. Neurite formation during development is a dynamic process and therefore tight regulation seems necessary to achieve connection specificity. At earlier steps of circuit formation, axon guidance, an intensively investigated process, combines intrinsic factors and extracellular cues to form a trajectory towards the general target area (<a href=\"#bib60\">Williams et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schnorrer and Dickson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pappu et al., 2011</a>). Subsequently, the formation of precise axonal connections within the target area relies on the development of the correct number of axonal branches. Currently, the mechanisms regulating axonal branch number and accuracy are largely unknown and subject to much debate."

In addition, long axon collaterals innervating distant target areas occurring for example in corticospinal tract (CST) axons of layer V neurons can be eliminated (<a href=\"#bib58\">Weimann et al., 1999</a>). Removal of short redundant or inappropriate branches occurs typically via retraction of short branches whereas longer tracts are eliminated primarily by degeneration (<a href=\"#bib36\">Luo and O\u2019Leary, 2005</a>).

Nevertheless, a specialized form of pruning also occurs in <i>Drosophila</i>, namely the widely studied remodeling of insect networks during metamorphosis. In holometabolous insects, like the fruit fly, many cells need to accommodate two distinct morphological and behavioral states within a lifetime. In the nervous system neuronal arbors have to remodel extensively to allow the reiterative use of larval neuronal populations to form adult circuits. Interestingly, the molting hormone Ecdysone is not only necessary for body transformation but also for the regulation of remodeling events in the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib53\">Truman, 1990</a>). This system resembles partially the emergence of an adult network from initial projections as seen in vertebrates in the visual and motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib39\">O\u2019Leary and Koester, 1993</a>)."

DCNs form only adult-specific neuronal projections and therefore unlike sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib59\">Williams et al., 2006</a>) and mushroom body neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boulanger et al., 2011</a>), DCN axons are not remodeled during metamorphosis. DCN axons innervate the optic lobes via an initial phase of long-range axonal growth and retraction steps, followed by the establishment of a stereotypic number of axonal branches by an unknown mechanism. In this work, we first describe that this wiring pattern is achieved through initially excessive axonal branch growth followed by refinement during brain development. Next, we show that the refinement process is regulated through local activation of EGFR signaling in part by EGF-secreting sensory axons. We find that EGFR shows intrinsic differential distribution between individual developing DCN axonal branches and that the appropriate level of signaling is required for proper axonal branching. Mechanistically, we find that, in this context, the EGFR acts via regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and not the canonical mitogen activated kinase (MAPK) pathway. Finally, high-resolution 4D live imaging of pupal brain explants shows that inhibition of EGFR signaling causes a dramatic reduction in axonal branch dynamics leading to the failure of axonal branch pruning."

A small subset of neurons from this cluster extend their axons in the outer part of the optic lobe, the medulla (Me) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Srahna et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Langen et al., 2013</a>), where they form a stereotypic pattern of axonal branches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). This pattern can be readily visualized using the <i>ato-Gal4</i> driver in combination with a UAS-driven marker of choice such as CD8-GFP. Flip-out single cell clones (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wong et al., 2002</a>) reveal the branch pattern of an individual axon derived from a single neuron of the 12 medulla innervating DCNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). False color labeling and tracing (<a href=\"#bib34\">Longair et al., 2011</a>) of single DCN Me axons and their branches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) reveals that each axon generates 6\u20138 primary branches, with a mean of 7 branches. This stereotypic pattern is achieved by hot spots of branches extending in dorsal and ventral direction from each main axon shaft. The first main branch point is located at the border between lobula and Me with one or two branches. The next major branch point with often two branches is situated in Me layers M7\u2013M8 and in this location branches from distinct neighboring axons are often in close contact forming a grid-like pattern. The terminal set of up to four branches is distributed over the M1\u2013M3 layers and is more often intermingled with neighboring axon branches. In between the two most distal branch points intermediate branches occur occasionally. DCN branches never extend beyond the Me neuropil."

                                "text": "We carried out a targeted screen using loss and gain of function transgenes for signal transduction and axon guidance receptors to identify pathways that might regulate axon branch development. We noted excessive branching in the adult DCNs using a dominant-negative construct of the EGFR. To validate these findings we first analyzed flies carrying a viable hypomorphic loss of function mutation for the receptor (EGFR<sup>T1</sup>). In this genetic background DCN axons show short ectopic branches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) highlighted using the tracing tool (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2032</a>). Since the proper development of the optic lobes depends on EGFR signaling (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 1998</a>), reduced EGFR signaling might indirectly influence DCN axon formation and morphology. To investigate whether the EGFR is required in the DCNs for axonal branch refinement, we sought to generate DCN MARCM EGFR-null clones (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee and Luo, 1999</a>), whereby EGFR function is removed at the time of neuronal birth. We obtained very few clones, suggesting that the EGFR may be required early during development for cell viability. The clones we did obtain showed ectopic branching defects, but also severe axon targeting phenotypes, suggesting that the EGFR is required early in DCN development and precluding further analysis of these clones (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To avoid these early defects, we used the <i>ato-Gal4</i> driver, which is expressed in postmitotic DCNs after the initiation of axonal outgrowth (<a href=\"#bib50\">Srahna et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zheng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Langen et al., 2013</a>), to express two different dominant negative alleles of the EGFR (uas-EGFR<sup>DN-A</sup>, <a href=\"#bib16\">Freeman, 1996</a>; uas-EGFR<sup>DN-B</sup>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Buff et al., 1998</a>) and <i>EGFR</i><sup><i>RNAi</i></sup> (uas-EGFR<sup>RNAi</sup>, VDRC107130). In all three cases the DCNs show a significant increase of axon branches in the adult CNS. Compared to an average of 7 primary branches under wild type conditions, we observed a significant increase to 10.5 primary branches per axon in EGFR<sup>DN-A</sup> expressing DCNs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,B\u2032,E</a>). Single cell clones in wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) and EGFR<sup>DN\u2212A</sup> background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>) show the branch increase on single cell level. Expression of the second, weaker, EGFR<sup>DN</sup> allele (<a href=\"#bib54\">Urban et al., 2004</a>) (EGFR<sup>DN-B</sup>) resulted in an increase to an average of 8.3 branches per axon (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,C\u2032,E</a>), and EGFR knock-down with RNAi leads to a similar increase to 8.5 branches per axon (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,D\u2032,E</a>). In the case of the EGFR<sup>DN-A</sup> axonal branches appear thin and spike-like suggesting that they are immature. Interestingly, inhibition of EGFR results not only in an increase of the average branch number, but also increases the variability in the branch numbers between individual axons (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), even within the same individual brain, suggesting that EGFR signaling may regulate the accuracy and robustness of the branching process."

To confirm that EGFR signaling regulates DCN axon branching, we first tested adult hypomorphic mutants for the EGFR ligand Spitz (Spi) whose role in optic lobe development is well described (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib44\">Salecker et al., 1998</a>). Reduction of Spi activity results in ectopic short branches indistinguishable from those seen in EGFR hypomorphic mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,A</a>\u2032; compare to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,A\u2032</a>). To determine the source of the EGF signal that regulates DCN branch refinement, we considered two possibilities. First, DCN axons themselves might release an activating ligand to initiate an autocrine signaling mechanism, as seen in the p75-TNR axo-axonal competition of mouse and rat sympathetic axons innervating the eye (<a href=\"#bib49\">Singh et al., 2008</a>). Second, neurons in the target neuropil might release EGF to regulate branch refinement. A subset of retinal photoreceptors known as R8 and R7 have axon terminals that innervate the medulla. Photoreceptors are known to secrete Spi to initiate a number of EGFR-dependent events in the developing optic lobes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang and Kunes, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yogev et al., 2010</a>). We analyzed the coincidence of innervation of the medulla by R7 and R8 photoreceptor axons using the photoreceptor specific marker mAb 24B10 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fujita et al., 1982</a>). Overlap between DCN and R7/8 axons can be seen at different times during brain development and in the adult brain (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>)."

To distinguish between these two possibilities, we analyzed DCNs expressing EGFR<sup>DN</sup> during pupal development. Between 36 hr and 48 hr APF axon branching at the second branch point is similar to wild type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J,K</a>). An initial difference in branch phenotype can be observed at 60 hr APF and subsequently at 72 hr APF, the typical refinement seen in wild type is largely absent in the EGFR<sup>DN</sup> background (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L\u2013M</a>\u2032). The failure to prune is evident at 84 hr and 96 hr APF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N,O</a>) where DCN axons show excessive axonal branches. To rule out developmental delay as a cause we examined 2-day vs 18-day-old EGFR<sup>DN</sup> flies. These flies are indistinguishable from 96 hr APF EGFR<sup>DN</sup> flies indicating no further branch refinement (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Finally, we quantified axonal branch pruning at 48 hr and 72 hr APF by counting the number of branch end-points at these two time points in wildtype and EGFR<sup>DN</sup> flies, respectively. While there is no significant difference between the two genotypes at 48 hr APF, quantification at 72 hr APF confirms the increased amount of branches in the EGFR<sup>DN</sup> background compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P</a>). In addition, the significant decrease in branch number seen in wild type axons between 48 hr and 72 hr is not observed in the EGFR<sup>DN</sup> axons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P</a>). In summary, these data show that EGFR signaling is required to generate the correct number of axonal branches through the reduction of branch precursors formed during development (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Q</a>)."

After 2 days in culture wildtype <i>Drosophila</i> primary neurons sprout on average \u223c2.5 primary axonal branches, whereas neurons expressing EGFR<sup>DN</sup> show a significant increase in branch number (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>), suggesting that regulation of axonal branching by the EGFR is a process intrinsic to neurons and common to different neuronal subtypes. Axonal branches develop from dynamic filopodia that gets stabilized during the axonal branching process. We quantified the dynamics of filopodia under WT and EGFR loss of function conditions. We find that in growing wildtype neurons less than 10% of filopodia are static during the imaging time window of 3 min. In contrast, EGFR<sup>DN</sup> neurons have a significant increase in the percentage of static filopodia to \u223c30% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>). An increase in static filopodia may suggest that more of the transient protrusions are stabilized into branches. An indication of the maturation of filopodia into branches is the invasion of microtubules into axonal filopodia (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gallo, 2011</a>). Accordingly, we find that EGFR<sup>DN</sup> induces an increase in microtubules invading axonal filopodia (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data suggest that EGFR signaling regulates branch formation by controlling the dynamics of immature protrusions. To examine the localization of the EGFR in primary neurons, we cultured neurons from animals expressing C-terminally GFP-tagged EGFR (UAS-EGFR<sup>GFP</sup>) and performed live imaging experiments. We find that the EGFR is dynamically transported into and out of axonal branches and their filopodia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), with slightly, but significantly, higher levels in dynamic filopodia compared to static filopodia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2032,A\u2033</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In summary, our data indicate that EGFR is differentially localized to static vs dynamic filopodia and that its activity promotes dynamic filopodial behavior and consequent adjustment of branch number."

To this end, we compared levels of EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> in filopodia of control vs EGFR<sup>DN</sup> neurons. We find that the difference in EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> levels between dynamic and static filopodia drops dramatically upon inhibition of EGFR signaling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,B\u2032,B\u2033,C</a>). EGFR signaling depends on receptor endocytosis upon ligand binding (<a href=\"#bib21\">Haigler et al., 1979</a>). Interestingly, EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> traffics actively all along the axonal shafts, branches and filopodia in cultured neurons (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), and we find EGFR-GFP puncta partially co-localize with both Rab5 and Rab11, suggesting that EGFR is present on early and recycling endosomes (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data indicate that recycling might lead to differential EGFR localization in filopodia. Because the EGFR<sup>DN</sup> used here can still bind ligand but fails to signal, one interesting possibility is that these dominant negative receptors may titrate ligand away from the functional receptor and thus inhibit not only signaling, but also internalization. To test the putative role of endocytosis in receptor dynamics, we live-imaged EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> localization in filopodia before and after inhibition of endocytosis using the Dynamin inhibitor Dyngo (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harper et al., 2011</a>). In untreated wild type neurons, EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> levels vary between individual filopodia and within each filopodium over time (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). Upon inhibition of endocytosis, the overall levels of EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> in filopodia decrease and the fluctuation of EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> between and within filopodia is significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2032\u2013C</a>). This is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in filopodial dynamics (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), suggesting that receptor endocytosis and recycling regulates EGFR localization and dynamics in filopodia."

                                "text": "Next, we asked if the EGFR is differentially localized and regulates branching dynamics in vivo. <i>EGFR</i> transcription (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schejter et al., 1986</a>) and function in the <i>Drosophila</i> developing and adult brain have been documented, where it plays a role in neuronal survival (<a href=\"#bib4\">Botella et al., 2003</a>) and sleep regulation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Foltenyi et al., 2007</a>). However, attempts to detect the EGFR protein using immunohistochemistry have thus far failed, most likely due to very low expression levels. We attempted to circumvent this problem by generating a genomic rescue construct tagged at the C-terminal end with GFP, identical to the UAS-EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> used in our cell culture experiments. This construct rescues the embryonic lethality of EGFR null mutants to full adult viability with no visible defects. We examined the expression of genomic EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> during brain development and find that it is broadly expressed in the developing neuropil, especially the distal medulla (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggesting that EGFR signaling may be generally involved in the regulation of CNS connectivity. Indeed, inhibition of EGFR activity in the lateral neurons ventral (LNv) also causes excessive axonal branching (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Unfortunately, expression levels of the genomic EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> transgene were too low to allow analysis at sub-cellular, single axon branch resolution. To examine subcellular EGFR distribution, we expressed UAS-EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> in the DCNs. In DCNs, EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> is detected in a punctate pattern in the cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, insets), along the axons and in axonal branches (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>). At \u223c56 hr APF, when extensive growth and pruning occur, EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> is unevenly distributed across different branches of the same axon (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013A\u2034</a>) and we find no stereotypic pattern across different individual axons or individual brains (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). At \u223c72 hr APF, after significant pruning has occurred, EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> is distributed more uniformly across the remaining unrefined branches (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013B\u2034</a>). Note that both wildtype-untagged EGFR and EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> do not change the DCN branching pattern (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), hinting that asymmetric receptor signaling is governed by differential receptor distribution, rather than total receptor levels per se. In the LNv, EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> is expressed in cell bodies and low levels are present along the growing axons during development (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). In contrast, in adult LNv UAS-EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> becomes restricted to neuronal soma (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2032</a>). Thus, remarkably, even overexpressed EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> is present at relatively low levels and shows regulated developmental localization in different neuronal populations in vivo."

                                "text": "DCN branches develop and prune during pupal development when the brain is not easily accessible to live imaging. To overcome this limitation, we modified the protocol for long-term adult brain explant culture (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ayaz et al., 2008</a>) to support long-term pupal brain culture. This protocol supports the morphologically normal development of <i>Drosophila</i> pupal brains (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). We sought to probe the basis of the regulation of developmental branch pruning by the EGFR. To this end, we performed high-resolution 4D live imaging to analyze real-time DCN axon branch formation by pairing the brain explant culture technique with resonant confocal microscopy of the cultured brains in a closed perfusion chamber (<a href=\"#bib61\">Williamson and Hiesinger, 2010</a>). Imaging of developing wild type pupal brains (40 hr\u201360 hr APF) shows that wildtype DCN axon branches are dynamic (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Branch growth and removal occurs within minutes and can span up to 11.5 \u03bcm within 5 min with an average of 7.5 \u03bcm during this period (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C<sub>1</sub>\u2013C<sub>3</sub>,E</a>). Furthermore, wildtype branches behave differently from each other, as indicated by the spread of growth and retraction speeds of different branches (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). In contrast, the growth dynamics in the EGFR<sup>DN</sup> expressing neurons are reduced in speed (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Growth and retraction processes of single branches are decreased to an average of 3 \u03bcm within 5 min and the dynamics show strikingly reduced variability between individual branches (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>3</sub>,F,G</a>). We wondered whether we could exploit the new developing brain culture system to ask whether EGFR is dynamically trafficked within DCN branches in vivo as these branches grow and retract. To this end, we generated flies expressing both EGFR-GFP and a red fluorescent protein (td-Tomato) in the DCNs. Live imaging (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>) of pupal brains from these animals and analysis of still images form these videos (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>) confirms that, like in primary neurons in culture, EGFR is trafficked dynamically as axons grows and retracts their branches in vivo; finally, it should be noted that EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> shows similar localization and activity to its wild type counterpart (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), in agreement with the fact that the identically tagged genomic construct rescues the null mutant to full viability."

Activation of the MAPK cascade and transcriptional changes in the nucleus are main features of this pathway (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vivekanand and Rebay, 2006</a>). A nuclear marker for active MAPK signaling is double phosphorylated ERK (dpERK). Despite the fact that we verify expression in developing L3 eye disc (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), we were not able to detect dpERK in developing DCN (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B-B\u2033</a>). One caveat is that activation of ERK might be difficult to detect due to low expression levels and timing issues. To further investigate if the canonical pathway is involved, we analyzed the effect of MAPK pathway genes (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vivekanand and Rebay, 2006</a>) on DCN axon refinement. Expression of Ras1<sup>RNAi</sup>, Drk <sup>RNAi</sup>, a constitutively active form of ERK or a constitutively active form of Ras1 did not change the DCN branching pattern (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013G</a>). These results indicate that refinement occurs independently of the canonical EGFR pathway."

We used actin-GFP (<a href=\"#bib55\">Verkhusha et al., 1999</a>) and Utrophin-GFP (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rauzi and Lenne, 2011</a>) expression in the DCNs to examine the distribution of total actin and filamentous actin (F-actin), respectively, in wild type vs EGFR<sup>DN</sup> backgrounds. The F-actin binding protein Utrophin (<a href=\"#bib18\">Galkin et al., 2002</a>) was utilized to analyze the distribution of actin filaments in wildtype and EGFR<sup>DN</sup> axons. Utrophin-GFP reveals that F-actin is largely confined to the branches (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013A\u2034</a>, arrowheads) with low levels of F-actin in the axon shafts (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2034</a>, arrow) of wildtype brains. In contrast, in DCNs expressing EGFR<sup>DN</sup> F-actin distribution appears weaker and more diffused over the axon shaft and axon branches (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013B\u2034</a>, arrowheads). Similar to F-actin, total actin-GFP concentrates at the branch tips (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013A\u2034</a>, arrowheads) and little actin is present within the main axon shaft. In contrast, in EGFR<sup>DN</sup> DCNs total actin also accumulates in blebs along the entire length of the axons and their branches (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013B\u2034</a>, arrows). Axonal swellings have considerably lower F-actin accumulation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2034</a>, asterisk) compared to total actin (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2034</a>, asterisk) suggesting that in EGFR<sup>DN</sup> axons, monomeric actin is retained in axonal swellings along the axons, thus potentially inhibiting efficient actin polymerization dynamics at the branch tips."

This enhances actin dynamics and results in the proper balance of branch growth and pruning. However, an alternative possibility is that EGFR signaling simply instructs branch retraction. Both models predict increased branch numbers when EGFR signaling is inhibited. However, if EGFR signaling instructs branch pruning, activated EGFR would result in reduced axonal branching. In contrast, if EGFR signaling asymmetry is indeed required for the correct number of DCN axonal branches, then constitutive activation of the EGFR should also result in increased axonal branching. To distinguish between the two models, we analyzed the effect of a constitutively active form (UAS-EGFR<sup>CA</sup>). In agreement with a differential local signaling model, EGFR<sup>CA</sup> induces a significant increase of DCN branches both in vitro (<a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and in vivo (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C\u2013D</a>) similar to down regulation of EGFR signaling. Importantly, similar to loss of EGFR function, the increase in branch number induced by gain of EGFR function is also due to reduced pruning during development (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013H</a>). Furthermore, in EGFR<sup>CA</sup> axons total actin and F-actin also distribute more uniformly across the axonal projection (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I\u2013I\u2034</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013C\u2034</a>, arrows), again suggesting reduction of efficient polymerization dynamics. In summary, EGFR signaling affects branch growth and retraction likely through the regulation of actin polymerization."

This mechanism ensures that all targets are properly innervated, it enables further specification of connections by the target environment like neighboring neurons and glia (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stevens et al., 2007</a>) and permits the removal of exuberant or mistargeted branches. Studying real-time events in the mammalian system involving CNS refinement is challenging. The <i>Drosophila</i> developing brain culture system used in this work combined with live imaging allows examination and manipulation of neuronal growth dynamics. Our data suggest that EGFR signaling, in part triggered by the co-innervation of the target neuropil by sensory neurons from the retina, is a crucial determinant of axonal branch refinement by the regulation of filopodial growth and retraction dynamics. Finally, we find that EGFR activity regulates actin polymerization dynamics at the branch tips. Consistent with this notion, we find that interfering with actin dynamics in vivo by inhibition of the small GTPase RhoA or constitutive activation of the actin filament severing protein Cofilin, is sufficient to cause ectopic axon branch formation in the DCNs (data not shown). EGFR expression has been observed in neurites of mammalian neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gerecke et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2005</a>) and knock-out of the EGFR in the mouse results in increased neurite branching in the skin (<a href=\"#bib37\">Maklad et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that the mechanism we identify in the fly CNS may be more generally utilized."

We show that intrinsically asymmetric EGFR localization and signaling is required for efficient branch pruning. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, EGFR is asymmetrically localized in branches and filopodia both in vivo and in cultured primary neurons. Second, both inhibition and constitutive activation result in failure of axonal branch refinement. Third, overexpression of the wildtype receptor, which is differentially localized and trafficked, is not sufficient to produce a phenotype. This argues that receptor localization dynamics\u2014possibly mediated by endocytosis\u2014rather than total EGFR levels, is the cue for filopodial collapse and subsequent axonal branch pruning. What explains the link between regulation of dynamic behavior and the generation of a specific number of axonal branches? A hint to this comes from three observations. First, both loss and gain of EGFR function increase proportion of static filopodia from less than 10% to more than 30%, subsequently increasing the number of axonal branches. Second, this filopodial behavior correlates with small, but significant and highly dynamic differences in EGFR localization. Third, loss of EGFR signaling increases the variability in axon branch number. Based on these observations we propose that in wildtype neurons most dynamic filopodia collapse over time, resulting in continuous redistribution of EGFR among fewer and fewer remaining filopodia. This process stops usually when only one filopodium remains at a given branching point, and occasionally when EGFR happens to distribute equally between the last two filopodia. This probabilistic process does not require an additional mechanism of branch \u2018tagging and selection\u2019 and can explain both EGFR loss of function phenotypes: increased branch number and increased variability. What remains to be determined is the interaction between EGFR-dependent branch dynamics and the specificity of the spatial pattern of branches."

For dynamic filopodia, measurements were taken during the first 8 s of the retraction or extension. For static filopodia, measurements were taken during 8 s at the middle of the recording period. These measurements were used to calculate the ratio of EGFR<sup>GFP</sup> in dynamic minus static filopodia (GFP maximal intensity of each dynamic phase minus the mean of GFP maximal intensity in static filopodia)."

Using Drosophila adult brain neurons as a model, the authors provide comprehensive evidence for the instrinsic role of EGFR in regulating terminal axon branching by controlling the dynamics of filopodia. This evidence is based on a comprehensive set of experimental approaches including genetic gain- and loss-of-function, single cell analysis and time-lapse microscopy using an innovative ex vivo preparation. Furthermore, the authors explore the downstream signaling pathway that might underlie this unconventional function for EGFR and demonstrate that it is not involving a 'canonical' set of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling (Ras-MAPK signaling). Finally, the authors explore the involvement of actin dynamics and show that EGFR signaling in axon branching involves a control of F-actin polymerization in axonal filopodia."

Therefore, the significance of results is high. However, one reviewer raised a number of substantial concerns regarding some aspects of the work, focusing on: First, the loss and gain of function of EGFR causes the same effect in branching. It is true that there might be a way to interpret this, but the understanding of the downstream signaling events is not sufficient to validate the model. Second, endocytosis blockade led to a decrease of the receptor level. This is not intuitive and needs to be explored further. Third, the subcellular localization of EGFR is very interesting. However, the correlation between the presence of EGFR in vivo and the fate of branches is not established."

Instead, we turned to a classical assay that is used to gauge EGFR activity in vivo. Formation of the wing veins in flies requires spatially restricted EGFR activity. When wild type EGFR is expressed in the developing wing outside the normal vein domains, it causes the formation of ectopic vein tissue (e.g., Hahn et al. 2013). We find that both a control untagged wild type EGFR and EGFR-GFP cause equivalent ectopic wing vein formation (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 3B-D\u2019</a>). Altogether, our data show that a GFP tag in the C-terminus of EGFR does not compromise its activity in vivo."

While live imaging of DCN filopodia is currently feasible over a period of 2-4 hours (<a href=\"#media5\">Videos 5 and 6</a>), continuous live imaging over several days in these brain cultures is not yet possible. It should be noted that in this case one would be attempting to correlate events that take place on the scale of seconds (EGFR trafficking) with events that take place on the scale of minutes (filopodial growth and collapse), with their ultimate consequences, which take place on the scale of days (i.e., the final loss or stabilization of a branch). Furthermore, both genomic and even overexpressed EGFR-GFP are almost undetectable in brain neurons without anti-GFP antibody staining, as stated in the original manuscript. We find this to be true not only in DCNs but also in other neurons, such as LNv, also as stated in the original manuscript. For all these reasons, we had reasoned that the weakness of the signal in unstained brains precludes live imaging of EGFR-GFP puncta in DCN filopodia in vivo. This is why we performed these experiments in cultured primary neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5 and its supplement</a>). As stated in the original manuscript we find that small, but highly significant (p &lt; 0.0001) differences in EGFR levels correlate with increased filopodial dynamics, both growth and retraction."

However, as the reviewer suggests, the same final phenotype may result from different types of developmental effects. To this end, we have performed a developmental analysis of EGFR<sup>CA</sup> and find that gain of EGFR function inhibits axonal branch pruning during development, mimicking the effects of EGFR loss of function (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E-H</a>).

Vein is likely provided by cells adjacent to DCN axons, as shown by the Vein-LacZ reporter transgene. Furthermore, a more recent study shows that an overexpressed Spitz-GFP transgene is secreted from photoreceptor axon terminals (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yogev et al. 2010</a>), as stated in the original manuscript. To our knowledge, there are currently no Spitz antibodies that work in vivo. We were not able to find references in the recent literature (last 10 years) to such reagents. A 1998 paper (Huang et al.) does report endogenous Spitz protein expression all along the axons of all photoreceptors, consistent with our genetic evidence. We acquired the same antibody used in the 1998 study, but find that the reagent does not appear to work any longer. We were unable to detect any Spitz expression, including in positive control tissue such as the developing retina."
