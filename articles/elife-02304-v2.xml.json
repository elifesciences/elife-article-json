                    "text": "Malate and lactate dehydrogenases (MDH and LDH) are homologous, core metabolic enzymes that share a fold and catalytic mechanism yet possess strict specificity for their substrates. In the Apicomplexa, convergent evolution of an unusual LDH from MDH produced a difference in specificity exceeding 12 orders of magnitude. The mechanisms responsible for this extraordinary functional shift are currently unknown. Using ancestral protein resurrection, we find that specificity evolved in apicomplexan LDHs by classic neofunctionalization characterized by long-range epistasis, a promiscuous intermediate, and few gain-of-function mutations of large effect. In canonical MDHs and LDHs, a single residue in the active-site loop governs substrate specificity: Arg102 in MDHs and Gln102 in LDHs. During the evolution of the apicomplexan LDH, however, specificity switched via an insertion that shifted the position and identity of this \u2018specificity residue\u2019 to Trp107f. Residues far from the active site also determine specificity, as shown by the crystal structures of three ancestral proteins bracketing the key duplication event. This work provides an unprecedented atomic-resolution view of evolutionary trajectories creating a nascent enzymatic function."

In the Apicomplexa, convergent evolution of an unusual LDH from MDH produced a difference in specificity exceeding 12 orders of magnitude. The mechanisms responsible for this extraordinary functional shift are currently unknown. Using ancestral protein resurrection, we find that specificity evolved in apicomplexan LDHs by classic neofunctionalization characterized by long-range epistasis, a promiscuous intermediate, and few gain-of-function mutations of large effect. In canonical MDHs and LDHs, a single residue in the active-site loop governs substrate specificity: Arg102 in MDHs and Gln102 in LDHs. During the evolution of the apicomplexan LDH, however, specificity switched via an insertion that shifted the position and identity of this \u2018specificity residue\u2019 to Trp107f. Residues far from the active site also determine specificity, as shown by the crystal structures of three ancestral proteins bracketing the key duplication event. This work provides an unprecedented atomic-resolution view of evolutionary trajectories creating a nascent enzymatic function."

A key event in the early evolution of the Apicomplexa was the acquisition of a malate dehydrogenase (MDH) via lateral gene transfer from \u03b1-proteobacteria (<a href=\"#bib38\">Golding and Dean, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Madern, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhu and Keithly, 2002</a>). Following a gene duplication event roughly 700\u2013900 Mya, one copy of this MDH evolved a novel substrate specificity to become a highly specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) that is now essential to the life cycle of many modern apicomplexans (<a href=\"#bib65\">Royer et al., 1986</a>). As a core metabolic enzyme that evolved independently of metazoan LDH, the unique apicomplexan LDH has attracted significant attention as a potential drug target (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gomez et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Read et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cameron et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Conners et al., 2005</a>).

Both enzymes are found in central metabolism: MDH catalyzes the interconversion of oxaloacetate and malate in the citric acid cycle, and LDH converts pyruvate to lactate in the final step of anaerobic glycolysis. Despite their structural and catalytic similarities, modern apicomplexan LDHs and MDHs have extraordinarily strict substrate specificity. For example, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (<i>Pf</i>) MDH and LDH each prefer their respective substrates by over six orders of magnitude. The biophysical basis for this extraordinary substrate preference is presently an unresolved question."

In the LDH/MDH superfamily, closure of this loop over the active site is rate-limiting during catalysis (<a href=\"#bib76\">Waldman et al., 1988</a>), and mutations within this loop have large effects on activity and substrate specificity (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wilks et al., 1988</a>). For example, simply mutating Gln102 to Arg in the specificity loop of <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus</i> (<i>Bs</i>) LDH converts the enzyme into an MDH, shifting specificity from a 10<sup>3</sup>-fold preference for pyruvate to a 10<sup>4</sup>-fold preference for oxaloacetate (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wilks et al., 1988</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, residue numbering is based on the dogfish LDH convention [<a href=\"#bib32\">Eventoff et al., 1977</a>]). In fact, all known MDHs have an Arg at position 102, while canonical LDHs have a Gln, and consequently residue 102 has been called the 'specificity residue' (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chapman et al., 1999</a>). Residue 102 is thought to contribute to substrate discrimination by balancing the substrate charge within the active site: the positively charged Arg in MDHs forms a salt bridge with the C4 carboxylate of oxaloacetate, whereas the neutral Gln in canonical LDHs packs with the C3 methyl of pyruvate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Yet, attempts to convert an MDH into an LDH by mutating Arg102 to Gln have met with limited success (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nicholls et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cendrin et al., 1993</a>). In the apicomplexan LDHs, residue 102 is not a Gln but a Lys, a relatively conservative substitution compared to the MDH Arg. It is currently not understood why <i>Plasmodium</i> LDHs lack activity towards oxaloacetate, despite having a positively charged sidechain at residue 102 similar to MDHs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gomez et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Dando et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Winter et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kavanagh et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Shoemark et al., 2007</a>)."

Gene duplication is widely considered the major force that has driven the evolutionary diversity of protein functions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</a>). There are three general ways duplicated genes can be fixed in a population by selection: (1) \u2018dosage selection\u2019, beneficial increase in dosage due to multiple copies, (2) \u2018subfunctionalization\u2019, specialization of previously existing functions, or (3) \u2018neofunctionalization\u2019, creation of a novel function through the accumulation of beneficial, gain-of-function mutations (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ohno, 1970</a>). Most mutations, however, are either neutral or detrimental. A new duplicated gene typically degrades to a crippled pseudogene before it can acquire the rare beneficial mutations needed to confer a selectable function (<a href=\"#bib77\">Walsh, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lynch and Conery, 2000</a>). Hence, classical neofunctionalization has fallen out of favor in preference for models that begin with the duplication of a multifunctional protein, such as \u2018specialization\u2019 and \u2018subfunctionalization\u2019 models. Currently the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms that create novel functions in gene duplicates are fiercely debated (<a href=\"#bib35\">Force et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Conant and Wolfe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Soskine and Tawfik, 2010</a>), and there are few clear examples of classic neofunctionalization or gain-of-function mutations (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zhang and Rosenberg, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bridgham et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Voordeckers et al., 2012</a>)."

In order to identify the biophysical and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for pyruvate specificity in apicomplexan LDHs, we have reconstructed ancestral proteins along the evolutionary trajectories leading to modern apicomplexan MDHs and LDHs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We kinetically and structurally characterized the ancestral proteins together with multiple evolutionary intermediates. This work provides a clear example of neofunctionalization in protein evolution and the first crystal structures documenting the evolution of a new enzyme.

One important difference is that the apicomplexan LDHs have Lys102 for the \u2018specificity residue\u2019, rather than a Gln as found in the canonical LDHs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

As a bulky, hydrophobic residue, Trp107f could recognize pyruvate in preference to oxaloacetate by two mechanisms: a hydrophobic interaction with the pyruvate C3 methyl vs the negatively charged oxaloacetate methylene carboxylate and steric occlusion of the methylene carboxylate of oxaloacetate. Furthermore, Trp107f is conserved in all apicomplexan LDHs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting negative selection and functional importance.

To test this hypothesis we removed the insertion from <i>Pf</i>LDH and from the <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> (<i>Tg</i>) LDH2 (constructs <i>Pf</i>LDH-DEL and <i>Tg</i>LDH2-DEL). However, deleting the insertion from the modern LDHs abolishes pyruvate activity with no significant gain of oxaloacetate activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Both of these deletion mutants retain a Lys at position 102, but a specific MDH likely requires an Arg at position 102. Mutating Lys102 to Arg in <i>Pf</i>LDH-DEL results in a two order-of-magnitude gain in oxaloacetate activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However, this mutant fails to recapitulate the level of oxaloacetate activity seen in modern apicomplexan MDHs. In the modern enzymes, substrate specificity cannot be switched with mutations involving the loop insert and position 102, indicating that additional residues govern substrate preference."

This presents a conundrum, as our mutation trials in the modern enzymes failed to recapitulate the historical swap in specificity. However, the modern apicomplexan LDH and MDH enzymes differ by over 200 residues in addition to the loop insert and Arg102Lys, differences that have accumulated in the descendants of the ancestral MDH and LDH. Any of these differences may detrimentally affect the ability to switch substrate specificity with the insertion in the modern enzymes. We therefore reasoned that the ancestral background may be necessary for swapping specificity with the loop insertion. To test this, we reconstructed and characterized four key ancestral enzymes: AncMDH1, the ancestral protein that was transferred from \u03b1-proteobacteria to the archaic Apicomplexa, AncMDH2, the last common ancestor of all apicomplexan MDHs and LDHs, found at the critical duplication event, AncMDH3, the last common ancestor of all modern apicomplexan MDHs, and AncLDH, the last common ancestor of modern apicomplexan LDHs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

The likelihood and Bayesian ancestral reconstruction methodology that we use produces the most probable ancestral sequence given certain evolutionary model assumptions, along with a posterior probability for alternative amino acids at each position (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1\u20136</a>). Ambiguous residues are generally associated with positions of low conservation and presumably less functional importance. The reconstructed AncMDH2 and AncLDH sequences have 31 and 48 ambiguous positions, respectively, all of which are located outside of the \u2018first active site shell\u2019 (defined as within 6 \u00c5 of the substrate). In order to verify that these sequence ambiguities do not affect our kinetic results, alternative ancestral sequences were reconstructed and assayed. We tested the robustness of our ancestral proteins by constructing alternative ancestors based on perturbed sequence data, evolutionary assumptions, and phylogenetic methodology. Both phylogenies give very similar relationships, and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> summarizes both equally well. The alternative AncMDH2 (AncMDH2*) differs from AncMDH2 by 27 residues; the alternative AncLDH (AncLDH*) differs from AncLDH by 19 residues."

Addition of the six-residue insertion from AncLDH* to AncMDH2* confers pyruvate specificity without adversely affecting oxaloacetate activity (AncMDH2*-INS, <a href=\"#fig6s7\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 7</a>).

Each protein was crystallized with multiple substrates or ligands (lactate, malate, and oxamate inhibitor) and with NADH (resolution ranging from 1.35 \u00c5 to 2.05 \u00c5). Unfortunately, in all crystals with malate, the malate spontaneously converted to pyruvate and/or lactate via redox reactions and decarboxylation. In the crystals constructed with AncMDH2 and lactate, a phosphate was seen in the active site rather than lactate. In the following, therefore, the descriptions of the models are primarily based on enzymes crystallized with oxamate inhibitor or lactate, which are highly similar. All three ancestral proteins adopt the same overall fold and conformation as the modern, descendant enzymes. In particular, the ancestral active sites and specificity loops are highly similar to their modern counterparts."

Position 102 in fact differs in the four convergent LDH families: Gln in canonical LDHs (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wilks et al., 1988</a>), Lys in the apicomplexan LDHs, Gly in <i>Cryptosporidium</i> LDHs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Madern et al., 2004</a>), and Leu in trichomonad LDHs (<a href=\"#bib84\">Wu and Fiser, 1999</a>). Could the ancestral apicomplexan MDH have evolved pyruvate specificity by any of these alternative routes? To answer this question, we evaluated the potential of these different amino acids at the 102 position to confer pyruvate specificity in the AncMDH2 background. Each mutation increases pyruvate activity, but none result in a highly specific LDH. The canonical mutation (Arg102Gln) results in the largest gain in pyruvate activity (2800-fold) and the smallest loss of oxaloacetate activity (2500-fold) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Additionally, we tested whether the full six amino acid insertion was required to confer pyruvate specificity in AncMDH2 or if simply mutating Arg102 to Trp was sufficient. The Arg102Trp mutation all but abolishes activity towards both substrates, indicating that the loop insertion was necessary to switch the specificity residue (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

In the classic explanation of the molecular mechanism of substrate specificity, residue 102 discriminates between pyruvate and oxaloacetate primarily via charge conservation (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wilks et al., 1988</a>). In MDHs, the positively charged Arg interacts with and balances the negatively charged carboxylate of oxaloacetate.

Due to the insertion, residue 102 no longer interacts with the substrate and is extruded from the active site. In contrast, the hydrophobic Trp107f packs against the C3 methyl of the pyruvate substrate. Similar to the canonical LDH, oxaloacetate binding would result in an unbalanced and buried negative charge. As a large bulky residue, Trp107f can also occlude binding of the larger oxaloacetate, in which a methylene carboxylate replaces the pyruvate methyl."

Therefore, while Trp107f is necessary for substrate specificity in the apicomplexan enzymes (as indicated by the alanine scan mutations), it is insufficient to confer specificity."

Why do these constructs have high activity towards both pyruvate and oxaloacetate substrates? The crystal structure of AncMDH2-INS offers few clues, since the loop insertion, including Trp107f, adopts the same conformation as seen in AncLDH and the modern apicomplexan enzymes. Both the AncMDH2-INS and AncMDH2-INS-59Mut constructs have an Arg at position 102, like the MDHs. In fact, the bifunctional AncMDH2-INS-59Mut enzyme differs from the strict AncLDH by only a R102K mutation, suggesting that Arg102 is responsible for the oxaloacetate activity of AncMDH2-INS and AncMDH2-INS-59Mut. We speculate that perhaps the enzymes change conformation depending upon the substrate. When using pyruvate, these bifunctional enzymes may adopt an LDH-like conformation in which Trp107f interacts with the substrate (as seen in the crystal structure). On the other hand, when presented with oxaloacetate, perhaps Trp107f flips out of the active site, and Arg102 flips in to interact with substrate in a manner similar to the canonical MDHs. We are currently testing this hypothesis."

AncMDH2's k<sub>cat</sub> for pyruvate is 0.07 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, with a K<sub>m</sub> of 20 mM, while the physiological concentration of pyruvate is estimated to be about three orders-of-magnitude lower (e.g., \u223c50 \u03bcM in human erythrocytes [<a href=\"#bib37\">Garrett and Grisham, 2005</a>], the <i>Plasmodium</i> host during its blood stage). Based on these kinetic parameters, each AncMDH2 reduces one pyruvate molecule per hour. While the enzyme can be forced to reduce pyruvate in vitro, this negligible activity is unlikely to have been subjected to selection in vivo.

Epistasis can constrain the order of mutations and the pathways accessible to evolution, and hence it is of great importance in understanding the evolution of novel functions. In the apicomplexan dehydrogenases, the evolutionary mutations that switched specificity from oxaloacetate to pyruvate (the six-residue insertion and Arg102Lys) are insufficient to confer pyruvate activity in modern apicomplexan MDHs (<i>Pf</i>MDH-R102K, <i>Pf</i>MDH-INS, <i>Cp</i>MDH-INS, <i>Pf</i>MDH-R102K-INS, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

Mutagenesis within the insertion indicates that only a single position, Trp107f, contributes strongly to pyruvate activity and specificity. Both the insertion and Arg102Lys have a large effect on preference for pyruvate vs oxaloacetate, although by differentially affecting activity towards each substrate.

As a result, oxaloacetate preparations contain appreciable pyruvate contamination (approximately 1\u20133% from Sigma-Aldrich, depending on batch) and must be handled with care. All oxaloacetate stock solutions were made fresh before each assay and kept on ice to keep decarboxylation to a minimum. For enzymes with low pyruvate activity, the oxaloacetate decarboxylation has a negligible affect on measured rates. However, enzymes with appreciable pyruvate activity can display an apparent, artifactual oxaloacetate activity that is due to pyruvate contamination (<a href=\"#bib59\">Parker and Holbrook, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wilks et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Shoemark et al., 2007</a>). In this work, seven such proteins are <i>Pf</i>LDH, <i>Pf</i>LDH-K102R, <i>Tg</i>LDH1, <i>Tg</i>LDH2, AncLDH, AncLDH*, and AncMDH2-INS-R102K. For these proteins, oxaloacetate activity was assayed at high enzyme concentration (600 nM\u20131 \u03bcM), resulting in a biphasic \u0394A<sub>340</sub> trace with an initial burst in which pyruvate is rapidly consumed followed by a slower linear phase representing oxaloacetate reduction. The post-burst (slow) phase of the \u0394A<sub>340</sub> trace was used to quantify the oxaloacetate catalytic rate (<a href=\"#bib59\">Parker and Holbrook, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wilks et al., 1988</a>). This procedure controls for the standing pyruvate contamination but does not account for the relatively slow spontaneous decarboxylation during the assay. Hence, the oxaloacetate k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> values for the seven enzymes with high pyruvate activity should be considered upper limits on the true oxaloacetate activity. The low or negligible oxaloacetate activities of these seven enzymes were further confirmed by undetectable malate/NAD<sup>+</sup> reactions in spectroscopic steady state enzyme assays, and the absence of malate product as determined from 1D proton NMR (3 \u03bcM enzyme, 5 mM oxaloacetate, 5 mM NADH in NaCl/P<sub>i</sub>/D<sub>2</sub>O pH 7.5 over four hour reaction) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Shoemark et al., 2007</a>)."

All datasets were indexed, integrated, and scaled with XDS/XSCALE (<a href=\"#bib85\">Xds, 2010</a>). Datasets included all reflections that were significant according to the CC(1/2) criterion (flagged as \u2018*\u2019 in the XDS output), which typically extended to much weaker data than the conventional 2 sigma cutoff (<a href=\"#bib47\">Karplus and Diederichs, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Diederichs and Karplus, 2013</a>). The resolution of the data is defined as the resolution bin where CC(1/2) = 0.5. Structures were solved by molecular replacement using AutoMR in PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). Homology models for the AncMDH2 and AncLDH* datasets were generated by the Phyre2 server (<a href=\"#bib49\">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</a>). The AncMDH2 homology model was based on the structure for <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> MDH (2hjr, 62% sequence identity, <a href=\"#bib74\">Vedadi et al., 2007</a>), while the model for AncLDH* was based on the <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> LDH1 structure (1pzf, 65% sequence identity, <a href=\"#bib48\">Kavanagh et al., 2004</a>). AncMDH2-INS datasets were solved using the AncMDH2 structure as the model. <i>Pf</i> LDH_W107fA dataset was solved using the <i>P. falciparum</i> LDH structure (1t2d) structure as a model. All models were improved by rounds of manual building in Coot (<a href=\"#bib31\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and refinement by phenix.refine in PHENIX. Model quality of all structures was validated with MolProbity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Davis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chen et al., 2010</a>) in PHENIX. All structural alignments were generated using THESEUS (<a href=\"#bib73\">Theobald and Wuttke, 2008</a>). Structure images were rendered with PyMOL."

Loop-open states are generally more disordered (with higher B-factors) and sometimes the chain could not be traced for the loop. In loop-open states the substrate typically also has weak electron density and cannot be fit reliably. In loop-closed states the substrate generally has strong electron density, but complications arose for proteins co-crystallized with lactate and malate."

Malate can also oxidize to oxaloacetate in the crystals, and oxaloacetate is expected to spontaneously decarboxylate to pyruvate relatively quickly (over the multi-week time frame of crystallization). Additionally, pyruvate spontaneously reacts with NAD+ to form a covalent pyruvate-NAD adduct (<a href=\"#bib79\">White et al., 1976</a>). Although we added NADH to the crystallization mixture, we cannot reliably determine whether NADH, NAD+, or a mixture of the two is found in the crystals, and we have variable evidence for the pyruvate-NAD adduct. In both of the structures crystallized with malate (4plc and 4ply), the substrate electron density and loop conformation indicated that the malate had converted to pyruvate and/or lactate. Therefore, for the enzymes crystallized with lactate and malate, the fine details of substrate conformation and identity in the models should be viewed with skepticism, as we are fairly confident we have an unresolvable mixture of pyruvate, lactate, and pyruvate-NAD adduct in the active site, all of which will produce similar electron density. These concerns with substrate do not apply to the oxamate models (although the uncertainty in cofactor state still remains). Finally, in the 4plw model (AncMDH2 crystallized with lactate), clear phosphates were seen in the active site instead of lactate, presumably carried through from the initial purification step."

This multi-functional approach provides new insights into the shift of enzyme function in this case, and may be relevant to the evolution of other enzymes."

However, some further thinking might be in order to increase the impact of the paper and make it more accessible to a wider audience. Also, it would be great to articulate and summarize explicitly the mechanisms that confer specificity in 3 enzymes: MDH and two convergent LDHs. E.g., \u201ccharacterized by long-range epistasis, a promiscuous intermediate, and relatively few gain-of-function mutations of large effect\u201d is an excellent summary, but it does not help much in terms of mechanistic understanding.
