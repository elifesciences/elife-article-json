Here we demonstrate that TibC from ETEC harbors a heptosyltransferase activity on TibA and AIDA-I, defining a large family of bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferases (BAHTs). The crystal structure of TibC reveals a characteristic ring-shape dodecamer. The protomer features an N-terminal \u03b2-barrel, a catalytic domain, a \u03b2-hairpin thumb, and a unique iron-finger motif. The iron-finger motif contributes to back-to-back dimerization; six dimers form the ring through \u03b2-hairpin thumb-mediated hand-in-hand contact. The structure of ADP-D-glycero-\u03b2-D-manno-heptose (ADP-D,D-heptose)-bound TibC reveals a sugar transfer mechanism and also the ligand stereoselectivity determinant. Electron-cryomicroscopy analyses uncover a TibC\u2013TibA dodecamer/hexamer assembly with two enzyme molecules binding to one TibA substrate. The complex structure also highlights a high efficient hyperglycosylation of six autotransporter substrates simultaneously by the dodecamer enzyme complex."

Here we demonstrate that TibC from ETEC harbors a heptosyltransferase activity on TibA and AIDA-I, defining a large family of bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferases (BAHTs). The crystal structure of TibC reveals a characteristic ring-shape dodecamer. The protomer features an N-terminal \u03b2-barrel, a catalytic domain, a \u03b2-hairpin thumb, and a unique iron-finger motif. The iron-finger motif contributes to back-to-back dimerization; six dimers form the ring through \u03b2-hairpin thumb-mediated hand-in-hand contact. The structure of ADP-D-glycero-\u03b2-D-manno-heptose (ADP-D,D-heptose)-bound TibC reveals a sugar transfer mechanism and also the ligand stereoselectivity determinant. Electron-cryomicroscopy analyses uncover a TibC\u2013TibA dodecamer/hexamer assembly with two enzyme molecules binding to one TibA substrate. The complex structure also highlights a high efficient hyperglycosylation of six autotransporter substrates simultaneously by the dodecamer enzyme complex."

Autotransporters, representing the largest family of bacterial virulence factors, share a similar structural organization containing a signal peptide followed by a functional passenger domain and a C-terminal \u03b2-barrel translocation domain. Autotransporters play a critical role in diverse aspects of bacterial physiology including proteolytic digestion of host proteins, biofilm formation, adhesion and invasion of host cells, and intracellular motility (<a href=\"#bib21\">Henderson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lazar Adler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wells et al., 2007</a>).

Co-expression of TibC or AAH together with AIDA-I in <i>E. coli</i> BL21 cells resulted in a tight adhesion of the bacteria to HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and AIDA-I glycosylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Co-expression of TibC also induced TibA glycosylation in the heterologous system (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We further identified a minimal passenger domain fragment of TibA (TibA<sub>305-350</sub>) that could be efficiently glycosylated by TibC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). TibA<sub>305-350</sub> tagged with Flag epitopes at both termini was then fused C-terminal to the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO). The SUMO-Flag-TibA<sub>305-350</sub>-Flag fusion protein showed a slower migration on the SDS-PAGE gel when co-expressed with TibC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry analysis gave a mass of 20,758 Da that matched the theoretical mass (20,757 Da) of SUMO-Flag-TibA<sub>305-350</sub>-Flag (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Co-expression of TibC resulted in mass increase of 576, 768, or 960 Da, corresponding to the addition of 3, 4, and 5 heptoses, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The modified fusion protein was further digested with the endoproteinase Asp-N for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Asp-N digestion is expected to yield two major peptide fragments, DK-<sub>305</sub>SASKVIQNSGGAVITNTSAAVSGTN<sub>329</sub> and <sub>330</sub>DNGSFSIAGGSAVNMLLENGG<sub>350</sub>. We were able to detect abundant signals for both unmodified and modified DK-<sub>305</sub>SASKVIQNSGGAVITNTSAAVSGTN<sub>329</sub> in full scan MS analyses and only weak signals of the modified <sub>330</sub>DNGSFSIAGGSAVNMLLENGG<sub>350</sub> peptide, probably due to the hydrophobic nature. Mass measurements indicated that both peptides had multiple heptose modifications; a mixed population of modified peptides, containing different numbers of heptose conjugations, was observed. Similarly to that performed with AAH modification of AIDA-I (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2014</a>), serine residues (Ser-313 and Ser-322 within DK-<sub>305</sub>SASKVIQNSGGAVITNTSAAVSGTN<sub>329</sub>), but not threonine residues, were identified to be the modification sites by electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Supporting the heptosyltransferase activity of TibC, recombinant TibC was found to directly modify synthetic peptides derived from the passenger domains of either AIDA-I or TibA in which ADP-D,D-heptose, but not the anomer ADP-L,D-heptose, could serve as the sugar ligand (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>)."

These proteins generally bear more than 50% sequence homology to TibC/AAH and contain residues critical for the heptosyltransferase activity (see below). In the genomic locus, genes encoding BAHT are often followed by an autotransporter or a putative autotransporter, consistent with the notion that BAHT modifies its autotransporter partner for functioning (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). Consistent with the modification of AIDA-I by TibC, the passenger domain of AIDA-I shows sequence similarities to that of TibA and contains a number of heptosylation motifs identified in TibA previously (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Among several BAHTs analyzed, TibC behaved the best in recombinant expression and homogeneity. Purified His<sub>6</sub>-TibC was crystallized, but the good-looking crystals did not diffract due to internal disorders. TibC obtained from glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion expression was also crystallized, which only diffracted to 8 \u00c5 despite extensive optimizations. A number of point mutations designed to reduce the surface entropy were screened and a TibC variant with three mutated epitopes (E83A/E84A, K400A/K401A, and Q215A/E216A) produced the highest quality crystal. This mutant exhibited identical biochemical and biological functions to wild-type TibC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). A 2.9 \u00c5 structure was solved by single wavelength dispersion phasing using anomalous signals from selenomethionine (SeMet) and the naturally bound ferric ion (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

The overall shape of the dodecamer ring resembles a circular garland with an external diameter of 145 \u00c5 and a height of 72 \u00c5. Parts of the 12 protomers are lined side by side at the central plate to form the stem of the garland with an inner diameter of \u223c110 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The inner surface of the stem is decorated with uniformly distributed 12 ferric ions, forming a characteristic iron belt along the ring (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The presence of ferric ions is expected from the brownish color of recombinant TibC protein in solution. Six symmetric TibC protomers project upwards from the central plate while the other six project downwards, generating a gear-like shape at both sides. Two adjacent TibC protomers projecting oppositely contact each other in a back-to-back manner around a dyad axis; six back-to-back dimers are further linked together in a hand-in-hand fashion around a sixfold axis to form the garland-like ring (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, the dodecamer assembly can be viewed as a hexameric oligomerization of dimers. The back-to-back interface is extensive and tilts across the central plate by 45\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). The hand-in-hand connection creates 12 tilted grooves extending to the interior of the garland from both up and down sides."

The \u03b2-hairpin thumb and the iron-finger motif are insertions into the catalytic domain. The flattened \u03b2-barrel (residues 1\u201397) is structured from two four-stranded sheets that pack against each other. The barrel is stacked against the catalytic domain from the side and makes extensive contacts with \u03b29, \u03b212, and the loop linking \u03b13 and \u03b212; several hydrophobic residues from both domains are in close proximity at the interface (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The \u03b2-barrel is well separated from the catalytic domain and is unlikely to play a direct role in sugar transfer.

The typical GT-A fold consists of two \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 domains with a continuous central \u03b2-sheet. The GT-A glycosyltransferase features a D\u00d7D motif that binds to the nucleotide phosphate in the sugar donor via a metal ion (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bourne and Henrissat, 2001</a>). The GT-B fold has two Rossmann-like domains separated by a cleft, in which a sugar donor is positioned for nucleophilic attack by the substrate. The GT-B glycosyltransferase does not require metal ion for catalyzing sugar transfer (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wrabl and Grishin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hu and Walker, 2002</a>). The catalytic domain of TibC structurally more resembles the GT-B fold such as WaaC and MurG, two bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in cell wall synthesis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Grizot et al., 2006</a>), with its own distinctions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). One major difference is that the N-lobe of the TibC catalytic domain is not a typical Rossmann fold; its central \u03b2-sheet is four-stranded rather than six-stranded for a Rossmann fold and also misses the flanking \u03b1-helices at one side (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

The \u03b2-hairpin thumb consists of \u03b215, \u03b216, and a four-residue hairpin loop projecting away from the globular C-lobe (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The \u03b2-hairpin thumb mediates the hand-in-hand contact between adjacent dimers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Phe-265 and Val-266 at the tip of the thumb, together with a nearby Phe-368 from the catalytic domain, contact the same set of residues from the adjacent protomer to form a hydrophobic cluster (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To validate the structural observations, the three residues were each subjected to mutational analyses. TibC F368D mutant was largely insoluble. Both F265D and V266D mutants eluted as a dimer from the gel filtration column (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and failed to catalyze TibA heptosylation in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These results highlight the importance of the \u03b2-hairpin thumb in mediating the hand-in-hand association for assembly of an active TibC dodecamer. The data also explain the unique presence of two successive hydrophobic residues on TibC \u03b2-hairpin loop, which differs from other \u03b2-hairpin loops that are usually dominated by hydrophilic residues (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sibanda and Thornton, 1985</a>). The \u03b2-hairpin thumb is highly conserved in the BAHT family (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), supporting the view that an intact dodecamer is critical for this family of heptosyltransferase to modify its partner autotransporter."

This iron-finger motif lies \u223c20 \u00c5 from the catalytic cleft (see below) and its architecture belongs to the 1Fe-0S cluster. Differing from the most common zinc-finger motif, the 1Fe-0S iron-finger motif is only observed once in rubredoxin protein found in sulfur-metabolizing bacteria and archaea (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lovenberg and Sobel, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Adman et al., 1975</a>). In rubredoxin, the 1Fe-0S cluster acts as an electron transfer carrier (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sieker et al., 1994</a>). The iron-finger motif in TibC, however, does not seem to function in electron transfer according to our structural and functional analyses. Notably, mutation of any of the four iron-coordinating cysteine residues resulted in a colorless TibC protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) due to the loss of iron binding. The four cysteine mutants eluted from the gel filtration column as heterogeneous interconverting oligomers with their sizes smaller than a dodecamer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Thus, the iron finger is required for maintaining structural integrity of the TibC dodecamer.

                                "text": "We also crystallized the TibC dodecamer in complex with its natural ligand ADP-D-glycero-\u03b2-D-manno-heptose (ADP-D,D-heptose). This was accomplished by soaking the sugar ligand into crystals of the catalytically inactive TibC D110A mutant. Structural determination was achieved by molecular replacement, which revealed extra omit density in the TibC catalytic domain. Placing the sugar into the omit density led to a concomitant loss of <i>F</i><sub><i>o</i></sub><i>\u2013F</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> density after the refinement. ADP-D,D-heptose was convincingly modeled into each protomer and a final model of 3.88 \u00c5 was obtained (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The 12 sugar ligands form an array of two parallel circles along the inner surface of the dodecamer ring and face towards the hollow center (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). ADP-D,D-heptose is located at the cleft between the two lobes of the catalytic domain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The adenine heterocycle fits snugly into a hydrophilic pocket and its N1 atom bears a hydrogen bond contact with Arg-286 of TibC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The hydrogen bond contact, though weak, is incompatible with a guanine due to its saturated N1, providing a structural basis for the specificity of TibC in using ADP-activated sugar donor. Moreover, the heptose hydroxyl O4 forms a hydrogen bond with Trp-305 indolic N1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The \u03b2-phosphate has strong interactions with Thr-226 and Lys-230 in the ligand-binding pocket of TibC. Lys-230 is also close to the heptose hydroxyl O5; its positive charge could potentially alleviate the negative charge of \u03b2-phosphate, thereby facilitating nucleophilic attack of the heptose C1 by the substrate acceptor."

In contrast, TibC exhibited a high stereoselectivity for ADP-D,D-heptose. To reveal the underlying structural basis, we modeled the structure of sugar ligand-bound AAH using the TibC complex as the template and examined TibC/AAH residues within 5 \u00c5 from the sugar ligand (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This led to the identification of residue 300 in TibC (294 in AAH) as a possible structural determinant. In TibC, residue 300 is a proline and its main-chain carbonyl oxygen forms two hydrogen bonds with D,D-heptose hydroxyl O4 and O6, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Notably, the latter interaction is incompatible with L,D-heptose due to the chiral inversion of C6 and the resulting spatial distance. For AAH, the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser-294 can have a polar interaction with hydroxyl O6 in D,D-heptose or hydroxyl O7 in L,D-heptose (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), thereby capable of tolerating both sugar ligands. Consistent with these structural indications, TibC P300S mutant could use both ADP-D,D-heptose and ADP-L,D-heptose while AAH S294P mutant instead became selective for ADP-D,D-heptose (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Thus, Pro-300-mediated polar interaction is a critical structural determinant for TibC sugar ligand stereoselectivity."

Cryo-EM micrographs revealed a well-defined shape of the TibC\u2013TibA dodecamer/hexamer complex at an intermediate resolution (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), allowing for single particle structural analysis (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>).

In this low-resolution model, density agreeing well with the crystal structure of the TibC dodecamer could be clearly identified, but the TibA moiety is slightly blurred and segmented, indicating a conformational heterogeneity.

The cross-correlation coefficient (CCC) for TibA in the final model is 0.76 (only a small N-terminal portion of TibA<sub>55-350</sub> is out of the density). The reconstruction revealed that six TibA<sub>55-350</sub> molecules are distributed along the inner surface of the TibC dodecamer ring and share its sixfold axis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Importantly, each TibA<sub>55-350</sub> binds to two TibC protomers of a back-to-back dimer, suggesting that two enzyme molecules are responsible for catalyzing full heptosylation of one TibA substrate. Ser-176 is the closest sugar acceptor situated at the entrance of the catalytic cleft of one TibC protomer (TibC-A), but the distance to the catalytic base exceeds 20 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). A similar distance was observed between the other TibC protomer (TibC-B) and its possible substrate acceptor (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Thus, the 8.9 \u00c5 TibC\u2013TibA dodecamer/hexamer complex model represents a sugar transfer incompetent state, designated hereafter as the resting state. Moreover, the spiral shaft of TibA \u03b2-helix adopts a trend roughly parallel to the sixfold axis of the dodecamer which, together with the patterned solenoid-like surface distribution of heptosylation sites on TibA (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2014</a>), indicates a possible screw propelling-like mechanism for processive heptosylation of TibA by the dodecamer ring."

The extra protruding density could not be appropriately fit despite extensive attempts at possible solutions. The heterogeneity observed in the cryo-EM image likely reflects the dynamic catalytic motions; the protruding density was tentatively interpreted as the TibA loop bearing the sugar acceptor Ser-176. This interpretation was supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a resting state TibC<sub>2</sub>\u2013TibA<sub>55-350</sub> trimer. In the 400 ps steered MD simulation, pulling Ser-176 in TibA<sub>55-350</sub> towards the heptose led to a proportional increase in the CCC (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D, E</a>). A subsequent 20 ns unbiased MD simulation produced an ensemble of TibA models that matched the EM density with a best overall CCC value of 0.87 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The final model of the entire complex was well accommodated by the experimental map (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The protruding loop was assigned to residues 170\u2013180 of TibA, resulting from disruption of a local \u03b2-strand within these residues. The loop placed Ser-176 into a position ready for attacking the sugar donor in one TibC protomer (TibC-A) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). This \u2018protrusion\u2019 state of TibA was designated as the catalytically competent active state. Notably, the other TibC protomer (TibC-B) in the back-to-back dimer and its possible substrate acceptor appeared to be in the resting state (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>), suggesting that only one of the two enzyme molecules in the dimer can be productive in transferring the sugar onto TibA at a time. It is worth mentioning here that the EM dataset presumably covers a continuous series of catalytic stages; the two discrete classifications employed in our reconstruction may not give a complete picture of all catalytic motions of the TibC\u2013TibA enzyme/substrate complex. The active state structure, which was reconstructed from two-thirds of the total particles, probably contains the majority of representative conformational stages in the catalytic process and therefore is used to represent the overall structure of the TibC\u2013TibA dodecamer/hexamer complex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

The selection of a double-layered ring with a large hollow channel is advantageous and provides a favorable environment for cooperative catalysis in a structurally economical manner. Assembly of the dodecamer into a ring can reduce the solvent-accessible surface area and renders a stable enzymatic machinery complex beneficial to efficient catalysis. Moreover, the spatial arrangement of the back-to-back TibC dimer, binding to the different glycosylation sites in one TibA, suggests a divalent catalysis is also probably contributing to the high catalytic efficiency required for hyperglycosylation. Thus, the dodecamer/hexamer enzyme/substrate complex with six symmetric units may represent a best compromise between structural economy and catalytic cooperativity/efficiency."

These grooves are optimally imbedded and close to the catalytic center, allowing for easy access of ADP-heptose from outside into the TibC particle. The catalytic center, on the other hand, is structurally best accessible from the interior, where TibA is located and can readily deliver the to-be-glycosylated serine by loop protrusion. We further speculate that the energy used to drive the rotation and shuttle motion of the TibA substrate is partially derived from breakdown of the ADP-heptose glycosidic bond occurring during catalysis. Further experiments such as obtaining a higher resolution cryo-EM structure of the TibC<sub>12</sub>\u2013TibA<sub>6</sub> complex, which may capture more catalytic stages/events, are necessary to validate the proposed model for TibC-catalyzed processive heptosylation of TibA."

The iron-finger motif does not fulfill the previously defined function of serving as an electron carrier in rubredoxin protein. Biochemical and structural studies have underscored the singular importance of this motif in mediating the back-to-back dimer formation and TibA substrate recognition. Interestingly, the iron-finger motif, adopting a topological fold similar to the zinc-finger motif, follows a right-handed helical path in binding to TibA \u03b2-helix, which is analogous to DNA binding by zinc-finger motifs. In addition, the recognition specificity and the interaction strength of this motif will have been precisely tuned during macromolecular evolution so that specific substrate recognition, sliding of the TibA \u03b2-helix along the reaction channel, and efficient protrusion of the TibA loop can all occur in a catalytically productive manner. It will be interesting to elucidate the detailed mechanism by which iron-finger motif-mediated substrate recognition is effectively coupled with its promoting of the TibA loop protrusion."

These findings are both notable for the identification of the enzyme responsible for glycosylation, because the sequence did not reveal such activity, and because of the dearth of information about heptosylating enzymes. In addition, the authors provide the X-ray structure of TibC, the first of the BAHT family of bacterial heptosyltransferases. The structure is an unusual ring-shaped dodecamer, with a catalytic domain that resembles the classic GT-B motif of nucleotide activated glycosyltransferases. However, the enzyme forms an unprecedented dodecamer in solution and, remarkably, in the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure. The authors show that a beta-hairpin thumb is essential for catalysis and dimerization and subsequent dodecamerization. They also prepared structure-guided mutants and analyzed the effects on catalysis. One of the mutants resulted in a cocrystal structure with ADP-D, D-heptose, which supported the proposed roles of several amino acids. The authors also describe a number of additional interesting features of the structure including a unique iron finger motif that contributes to back to back dimerization within the dodecamer. Finally, they used cryo-EM to analyze the autotransporter TibA and the complex of TibA and TibC, suggesting the complex consists of 12 TibC and 6 TibA molecules. The reviewers all agree that these are exciting findings that provide a significant contribution to the glycosyltransferase/carbohydrate, autotransporter, and post-translational modification fields that warrant publication in <i>eLife</i>."

The main points of the <i>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</i> paper do not overlap with the current manuscript that is more focused on the structure of TibC alone and in complex with the sugar donor as well as the TibA substrate. The two papers illustrate a complete story of the BAHT family of heptosyltransferase from genetic and physiological function to biochemical characterization and structural mechanism. The two papers, coming out around the same time, will generate a bigger impact in the field of bacterial pathogenesis and protein glycosylation."

The reason we chose this method for the low resolution refinement is because fixed B-factor refinement could reduce the unfavorable ratio of parameters (degrees of freedom) vs data to avoid the potential overfitting problem. In fact, it is a common sense that the atomic B-factors have little significance to reflect the internal thermal motion of atoms when the resolution falls below 3.5 \u00c5. In practice, this method produces the lowest Rfree. Accordingly, we have added a REMARK card to the deposited coordinate file to indicate this."
