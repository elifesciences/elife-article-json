Using mutant analysis, laser ablation, optogenetics, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we observed that following <i>C. elegans</i> male copulation, the duration of post-coital lethargy is coupled to cellular events involved in ejaculation. We show that the SPV and SPD spicule-associated sensory neurons and the spicule socket neuronal support cells function with intromission circuit components, including the cholinergic SPC and PCB and the glutamatergic PCA sensory-motor neurons, to coordinate sex muscle contractions with initiation and continuation of sperm movement. Our observations suggest that the SPV and SPD and their associated dopamine-containing socket cells sense the intrauterine environment through cellular endings exposed at the spicule tips and regulate both sperm release into the hermaphrodite and the recovery from post-coital lethargy."

The length of the refractory period varied between worms, but averaged roughly 12 min. This consisted of a period of disinterest, in which males did not approach hermaphrodites, followed by a period in which males attempted mating but were slower and less efficient, suggesting that the neural circuits controlling mating behaviors had yet to recover completely."

One such behavior, mating, is important for species propagation and can improve an individual's ability to cope with stress (<a href=\"#bib69\">Neumann, 2009</a>). In humans, rats, and other animals, a period of disinterest and mating inability follows ejaculation in males (<a href=\"#bib10\">Beach and Holz-Tucker, 1949</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Masters and Johnson, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barfield and Geyer, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Oomura et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Ureshi et al., 2002</a>). Primarily studied in rodents, sexual disinterest and inability following mating are described in two ways: the refractory period, defined by the short term duration between consecutive ejaculations (<a href=\"#bib51\">Levin, 2009</a>), and sexual satiation or exhaustion, a period of time following repeated copulations where the male rats require 6\u201314 days to regain sexual potency (<a href=\"#bib11\">Beach and Jordan, 1956</a>). If a male rat is considered to be sexually satiated, he cannot sire progeny even if he engages in copulatory activity (<a href=\"#bib90\">Tlachi-Lopez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Lucio et al., 2014</a>)."

After the spicules breach the vulval slit and fully penetrate, the males transfer sperm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</a>). Coupling proper spicule position with prodding is coordinated via cholinergic and glutamatergic signaling from the left-right bilateral post cloacal sensilla (p.c.s.) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These neurons sense the vulva using sensory processes that project posteriorly from the cloacal opening. They stimulate the sex-specific oblique and gubernaculum muscles that, via gap junctions, induce twitch contractions in the spicule protractor muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The protractor contractions are transduced into spicule movements through their hemidesmosome attachments to the spicule cuticle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Sulston et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). Appropriate prodding is limited to the vulva slit via dopamine (DA) signaling through the sensory ray neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Correa et al., 2012</a>). The left-right bilateral cholinergic SPC proprioceptive neurons innervate the protractor muscles and have a sensory projection that is attached to the base of the spicules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). When the spicules partially penetrate the vulval slit, the SPC neurons induce the protractor muscles to contract tonically, likely through sensing the change in spicule position (<a href=\"#bib27\">Garcia et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Garcia and Sternberg, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). \u223c14 s following spicule insertion, sperm moves from the seminal vesicle to the vas deferens (a process termed initiation) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), followed by drainage into the hermaphrodite uterus \u223c3 s later (a process termed release) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib79\">Schindelman et al., 2006</a>)."

To develop metrics for measuring how the male's behavior changes immediately after mating, we first determined how fast <i>C. elegans</i> males re-copulate following ejaculation. Within 2 min after being placed on a 5 mm diameter bacterial lawn containing 15 immobile hermaphrodites, 1-day-old virgin males commenced mating and inserted their spicules into the hermaphrodites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However following ejaculation, \u223c12 min (SD = \u00b16 min 30 s) passed before they intromit their spicules again (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The males obviously regained the ability to mate prior to the 2<sup>nd</sup> intromission, but their individual mating behaviors were variable, preventing us from establishing a metric to determine effectively when their full ability to mate returned. Thus, we conservatively refer to the interval from the 1<sup>st</sup> spicule insertion to the 2<sup>nd</sup> spicule insertion as the \u2018refractory period\u2019. We then asked if the refractory period duration was due to mating disinterest, reduced motor ability, or a combination of both."

After spicule retraction, \u223c5 min passed before the males re-executed copulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), indicating that male sexual drive was temporarily suppressed. However, even after males recommenced mating, the executions of subsequent motor steps were also slowed. The duration that the males spent positioned over the vulva prior to intromission was slightly longer, but not statistically different between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> mating bouts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>); however, the number of times they passed over the vulva was significantly increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

To determine if, in <i>C. elegans</i>, a longer refractory period might increase the amount of sperm transferred, we counted the number of sired progeny as a proxy for successful ejaculation. Each male was allowed to mate two consecutive times, and the refractory period was recorded. Additionally, the cross-progeny from each mated hermaphrodite was counted to determine if the male had successfully ejaculated. We found that we could bin the males into two groups, the first of which took 3 to 8:59 min to copulate twice, and the second of which took 9 to 30 min to copulate twice. We found that males with a longer refractory period were more successful in siring progeny than their counterparts, whose refractory periods were shorter than 9 min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Importantly, males from both groups did not display a difference in the amount of progeny they sired during the 1<sup>st</sup> mating (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This indicates that the reduced number of progeny sired during the 2<sup>nd</sup> mating, by the group of males with a shorter refractory period, is not due to a lack of ability. Thus, a longer refractory period allows males to recover their ability to sire progeny. We next asked how the various cellular components involved in ejaculation influence the refractory period."

The male gonad was one of our candidates for regulating male sexual drive, since it is implicated in modifying whether males fed or searched for a mate (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lipton et al., 2004</a>). The mature gonad consists of the germ line, seminal vesicle, and vas deferens (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We measured the initial insertion time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) and refractory period (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>) of males that had different cellular constituents of their gonad laser-ablated. We found that males lacking all of these structures required longer time to commence mating (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), implying that the gonad sends a signal to promote this behavior. After the operated males inserted and retracted their spicules, their refractory period was similar to the mock-ablated control and coincidentally similar to the time required for their 1<sup>st</sup> spicule insertion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). The behavioral similarity between gonad-ablated males and post-coital intact males led us to speculate that a pro-mating gonadal signal might be repressed or depleted by an aspect of ejaculation; re-establishing the pro-mating signal might occur during the refractory period."

The linker cell guides the developing gonad to the posterior region of the male. Removal of the linker cell late in development prevents the mature vas deferens from connecting to the cloacal opening (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sulston et al., 1980</a>). The somatic gonad and germ line are still functional and sperm moves from the seminal vesicle, but are retained in the vas deferens upon spicule insertion. Interestingly, the operation did not affect the initial mating drive (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). However, as a population of operated males, preventing sperm release increased the duration of the refractory period, relative to the mock-ablated control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Under closer inspection, the laser operation gave rise to two populations: males that displayed a normal refractory period and males that took much longer to re-mate (5 min 40 s (n = 6) vs 24 min 40 s (n = 5), p value=0.0043, Mann\u2013Whitney test) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). In equal proportions, some males were able to compensate for the lack of sperm movement, while others failed to do so. This suggests that the duration of the refractory period is plastic and could be modified by cellular components that directly or indirectly sense sperm release. This raised the question of what senses the transfer of sperm from the male into the hermaphrodite."

The spicules serve to anchor the male to his mate and to widen the vulval channel to facilitate the flow of sperm. In addition, each spicule contains the sensory dendrites of two neurons, the bilateral left/right SPV and SPD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These neurons send a process down the shaft of the spicule and have ciliated sensory endings that are exposed to the environment at the spicule tip. The processes of the neurons are surrounded by the structural sheath and socket cells (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sulston et al., 1980</a>). When we laser-ablated these neurons during L4, the resulting males had variable mating problems. These defects include failure to follow through the steps of mating, failure to insert their spicules, and failure to ejaculate or prematurely ejaculating sperm prior to intromission (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>); some of these defects have been previously reported (<a href=\"#bib55\">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Schindelman et al., 2006</a>). These pleiotropic defects made measuring the refractory period difficult. We speculated that removing these neurons too early in larval development resulted in the variable re-wiring of the remaining circuits. To examine SPV and SPD's role during the refractory period, we used the laser to cut off the spicule tips in virgin adult males (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This operation causes the cytoplasm of both SPV and SPD to leak out, killing the cells. Unlike the larval SPD and SPV-ablated males, spicule tip cut adult males did not display variable mating defects (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Both the mock-cut control and operated males displayed normal initial response times to hermaphrodites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), but interestingly, the spicule tips-cut males displayed a significantly shorter refractory period than control males (296 \u00b1 217 s vs 499 \u00b1 224 s, p value=0.0121, Mann\u2013Whitney test) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>).

Analysis of sperm movement revealed defects in the initiation and release steps of ejaculation. Under standard conditions, sperm moves from the seminal vesicle through the valve to the vas deferens (initiation) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and then drains out the cloaca into the hermaphrodite uterus (release) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Schindelman et al., 2006</a>). In approximately half of the spicule tips-cut males, the valve region opened (12/13 control vs 8/15 ablated, p=0.0377, Fisher's exact test), but sperm rarely passed out of the cloaca into the hermaphrodite (10/14 control vs 1/15 ablated, p=0.0005, Fisher's exact test). To verify if sperm transferred into the hermaphrodites, we moved the mated partner to individual plates after each successful insertion. The mated hermaphrodites contained a mutation that disrupts locomotion. We counted the number of plates that had moving cross-progeny, as a proxy for successful sperm release. 67% of control males sired progeny at the 1<sup>st</sup> mating and 33% of males sired progeny at the second mating (n = 12) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). No operated males were successful at the 1<sup>st</sup> insert, and only two were successful the 2<sup>nd</sup> time (n = 12) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Schindelman et al., 2006</a>). Thus, the putative sensory function of the spicules promotes both sperm movement and affects the refractory period. This raised the possibility that these two phenomena are coupled. The refractory state follows the ejaculatory behavioral state. Normally, the males should maintain the ejaculatory mating state, keeping their spicules inserted until all sperm are transferred (<a href=\"#bib79\">Schindelman et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, we used spicule insertion time as a proxy metric to ask if the spicule sensilla regulate the duration of the ejaculatory mating state."

We did not measure any differences in mating drive or ability between the two populations (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The average spicule insertion duration during the 1<sup>st</sup> mating was also not significantly different between the two treatments, although we observed a larger variability for spicule tips-cut males (F value = 0.0009) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). However, we noticed this difference became exaggerated during the 2<sup>nd</sup> mating. Generally, a male maintains spicule insertion throughout the sperm transfer process, which normally takes longer than 30 s. In contrast, many of the mating-experienced cut males inserted and retracted their spicules multiple times, with each penetration lasting only a few seconds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This observation indicated that the spicule tips-cut males were defective in either entering or maintaining the ejaculatory state. Therefore, we were interested in identifying what additional cells or circuits function temporally with the spicule sensilla to transition the male between intromission, ejaculation, and refractory behaviors."

From their structural morphology, the neurons are speculated to sense spicule movements through their proprioceptive attachments to the base of the spicules. Via acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated synaptic transmission, the SPC neurons can then induce tonic spicule protractor muscle contraction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Laser-ablation of these cells impairs sustained spicule intromission and consequently, the ability to ejaculate. The SPC makes chemical synapses to the gonad, raising the possibility that these neurons might also contribute to sperm movement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Sulston et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Garcia et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Jarrell et al., 2012</a>). We expressed G-CaMP in the SPC using the P<i>gar-3B</i> promoter and recorded fluorescent changes during mating (<a href=\"#bib56\">Liu et al., 2007</a>). Coincident with full spicule penetration, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients rapidly increased in the SPC. The peak G-CaMP fluorescence intensity occurred faster than in the SPV and SPD neurons (1.3 s vs 4.0 s, p&lt;0.05, ANOVA, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, similar to the SPV and SPD, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the SPC began to decrease during sperm movement into the gonadal vas deferens (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

Upon spicule insertion, this organ facilitates sperm transfer to the hermaphrodite (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The gonad's active role in ejaculation is not well understood, although it requires the cellular secretion machinery to promote sperm release (<a href=\"#bib79\">Schindelman et al., 2006</a>). Video recordings of the sperm-activating protease TRY-5 highlight the fluid movement in the gonad. First, fluid containing TRY-5 within the vas deferens transfers to the hermaphrodite, and then additional TRY-5 release coincides with sperm movement from the valve (<a href=\"#bib86\">Smith and Stanfield, 2011</a>). Since the cholinergic SPC makes chemical synapses to the somatic gonad, we asked if ACh signaling can stimulate gonadal Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. The potentially non-specific ACh agonist oxotremorine S (OxoS) induces males to protrude their spicules and some males to ejaculate. We expressed G-CaMP in the somatic gonadal valve using the <i>try-5</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib86\">Smith and Stanfield, 2011</a>) and asked if exogenously applied OxoS can induce valve Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. We saw increases in gonadal Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in males (n = 5) that were exposed to the agonist (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), indicating that the somatic gonad activity can be stimulated by ACh. We then asked when during mating can we detect somatic gonad activity."

This coordination in cellular activities is consistent with the idea that signaling from the cholinergic SPC partially contributes to the initiation of ejaculation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Garcia et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Emmons, 2005</a>). However, although Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the valve increased upon intromission, the contractions that open the valve did not immediately occur. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients remained high in the valve until it opened, on average 6.9 \u00b1 1.5 s after insertion (n = 7). When sperm moved through the vas deferens, the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the valve began to slowly decrease (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The delay between spicule insertion and the movement of sperm out of the seminal vesicle suggests that additional cells, which are active during this interval, might contribute to the opening of the valve."

Similar to the mock-cut males, the valve in spicule-tips cut males displayed a rapid increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). But instead of a distinct decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that coincide with the opening of the valve and sperm movement, the decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was more gradual and protracted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Coincident with the altered activity profiles, the valve did not open in 10/19 males (compared to 18/19 controls, p value=0.0078, Fisher's exact test), and in the remaining males, sperm was not transferred to the hermaphrodite. In contrast, nearly all mock-cut controls released sperm into their mates (1/19 ablated vs 18/19 controls, p value&lt;0.0001, Fisher's exact test). Taken together, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging suggests that immediately upon intromission, the SPC primes the gonad for the initiation of ejaculation, and the spicule sensory neurons provide further stimulation necessary for sperm movement and release."

Therefore, we wanted to confirm if stimulating a limited number of cells that included these neurons is sufficient to induce ejaculation in non-mating males. To address this question, we utilized the short wavelength light (blue, 475 nm)-activated ion channel channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nagel et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2005</a>). We expressed ChR2 from the promoters: P<i>gar-3b</i> (expresses in multiple cells including the SPC) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Liu et al., 2007</a>), P<i>unc-103</i>B (many cells including the post cloacal sensilla and spicule sensilla and sex muscles) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Reiner et al., 2006</a>), P<i>unc-17</i> (all cholinergic neurons) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alfonso et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Garcia et al., 2001</a>), and P<i>unc-17</i>S (head cholinergic neurons only). We found that none of the transgenic males expressing ChR2 initiated ejaculation or released sperm upon stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This result indicated that stimulation of specific groups of cells is not sufficient to induce the ejaculatory state. However, transgenic males simultaneously expressing P<i>unc-103</i>B:ChR2, P<i>unc-17</i>S:ChR2, and P<i>gar-3</i>B:ChR2 did ejaculate upon light stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This indicated that a larger number of cells than we expected, which includes the SPD, SPC, PCA, and PCB neurons, as well as sex-shared head and ventral cord neurons and sex muscles, must be stimulated to initiate ejaculation and release sperm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

However, compared to the mock-ablated control, ablating both SPC and PCB significantly reduced the number of males that released sperm (42%, p=0.013, Fisher's exact test) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This suggested an additive role for these cells in ejaculation behavior. However, some males still ejaculated in response to 475 nm light stimulation.

The oblique muscles, when contracted, help the male press the posterior region of his tail over the vulva during intromission attempts. During ejaculation, the contracted gubernaculum muscles pull the male proctodeum/protracted spicules posteriorly to allow the vas deferens' opening access to the cloacal opening (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Laser-ablation of the gubernaculum muscles causes the protracted spicules to block the vas deferens, thus inhibiting sperm release (<a href=\"#bib57\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). We speculated that if the PCA neurons facilitate sperm release, then the gubernaculum muscles and the PCA might display correlated activity. We used the P<i>unc-103E</i> promoter to express G-CaMP in the male sex muscles, and focused our region-of-interest on the anal depressor, gubernaculum erector, and gubernaculum retractor (<a href=\"#bib76\">Reiner et al., 2006</a>).

Coincident with the initiation of ejaculation, \u223c11 s later, the gubernaculum and anal depressor muscles displayed an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and became hyper-contracted (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). After \u223c15 to 20 s, we detected sperm in the hermaphrodite uterus.

We utilized P<i>dop-2</i> to drive G-CaMP expression in the PCB (<a href=\"#bib18\">Correa et al., 2012</a>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the PCB displayed minor increases upon insertion, and their activity quickly dissipated (<a href=\"#fig8s4\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This activity was unaffected by SPV/SPD removal (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s4\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This result suggests that PCB does not play a significant role after insertion. However, it does synapse to the gonad and can respond to SPD activity through its electrical coupling. We propose that in SPC-ablated males, the PCB can compensate for the loss of the SPC and promote 475 nm wavelength light-induced ejaculation in ChR2-expressing males."

In adult males, the socket cells encase the neuronal processes and sheath cells inside the spicule (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sulston et al., 1980</a>). Four socket cells are located on each side of the male tail, and during L4 larval development they secrete the sclerotic material that hardens to make the spicules (<a href=\"#bib42\">Jiang and Sternberg, 1999b</a>).

We found that insertion was unaffected (11 out of 27 control mock-ablated males could insert, compared to 7/22 ablated males, p value=0.6, Fisher's exact test). However, only 1/7 ablated males released sperm into the hermaphrodite for \u226510 s; the other ablated males showed variable dysfunctions in executing or sustaining sperm release. In contrast, 73% (n = 8/11) of mock-ablated males released sperm into the hermaphrodite for \u226510 s (p value=0.0498, Fisher's exact test). Thus, similar to cutting off the spicule tips, ejaculation was significantly reduced, indicating that the socket cells promote sperm release. However, ablating the socket cells was not equivalent to cutting off the spicule tips. In socket cell ablations, 6 out of 7 (86%) males released sperm from the valve (vs 12/12, 100% for mock-ablated), compare to only 8 out of 15 (53%) spicule tips-cut males (vs 12/13, 92% mock cut control, p value=0.038, Fisher's exact test).

A prediction from this hypothesis is that during intromission and ejaculation behavior, these cells are inert and will display no obvious changes in their cellular activities. To explore these ideas, we expressed G-CaMP in the socket cells using the P<i>bas-1</i> promoter and observed the socket cells during mating behavior. <i>bas-1</i> encodes the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase that converts L-DOPA to the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) in neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hare and Loer, 2004</a>). We found that socket cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients increased rapidly upon insertion, with a profile similar to the SPC and the gonadal valve (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients then declined to about half their peak intensity at the time of sperm release (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>).

Thus, we analyzed the contribution of the neurotransmitter DA in socket cell function during mating behavior. Previous work identified the importance of DA in the sex-specific bilateral sensory ray neurons R5A, R7A, and R9A in modulating tail posture, backward locomotion, and intromission attempts (<a href=\"#bib87\">Sulston et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Koo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Correa et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, DA deficient mutants exhibit difficulty transferring sperm, but the DA source was not identified (<a href=\"#bib18\">Correa et al., 2012</a>). To determine if the DA-expressing rays might potentially promote sperm movement in addition to the socket cells, we expressed G-CaMP using the P<i>dat-1</i> promoter.

When we measured if the males can sustain sperm release into the hermaphrodite for at least 10 s, 79% of wild-type males successfully transferred sperm, compared to only 31% of <i>cat-2(lf)</i> males (p=0.02, Fisher's exact test, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>)."

We found that while concentrations of 15 and 20 mM DA slowed down the time it takes a male to insert his spicules, the difference was not statistically significant (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). However, 25 mM DA induces a significant increase in the time required for males to insert their spicules (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Indeed, few males were successful in inserting their spicules within this time frame. This decreased mating ability was not due to sluggish movement or paralysis, as they still commenced mating in a similar, but slightly longer timeframe (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and their backing velocity along the hermaphrodite remained the same (171 \u00b1 43 \u00b5m/s <i>n</i> = 6 control, 178 \u00b1 35 \u00b5m/s <i>n</i> = 5 25 mM DA).

Mating is energy-costly and precludes participation in other behaviors such as feeding (<a href=\"#bib81\">Schneider et al., 2013</a>). Thus, a period of reduced activity following successful copulation is advantageous to organisms. In rats, the post ejaculatory interval represents the period (\u223c6\u201310 min) between ejaculations. After at least five successive ejaculations, males achieve a state of sexual satiation. During satiation, male rats will not mate again for 6\u201314 days (<a href=\"#bib11\">Beach and Jordan, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Phillips-Farfan and Fernandez-Guasti, 2009</a>). In this work, we also measured the post ejaculatory period in <i>C. elegans</i> males, referred to as the refractory period. However, we do not know if <i>C. elegans</i> males achieve a state of sexual satiation as exhibited by rodents. <i>C. elegans</i> males display an average lifespan of 12 days, show significant decline in sexual function at day 3, and are unable to sire progeny by day 5 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gems and Riddle, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Guo et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, the advantages <i>C. elegans</i> males would have by exhibiting an extended satiation time after multiple intromissions are uncertain, since their functional reproductive span is very short."

When males attempt to mate again too quickly, their ability to sire progeny is reduced. Although males recover from the refractory period whether they can sire progeny or not, we favor the hypothesis that the refractory period ensures that a male does not continuously copulate with the same mate. Following ejaculation, the males' mechanosensory and chemosensory neurons are still in immediate proximity to the hermaphrodite cues. A male that reinitiates the mating program, only to intromit his spicules into the same partner, is at a competitive disadvantage to disseminate his genetic material. Thus, the period of reduced activity and ability we observed following ejaculation may help insure that the male copulates with different partners (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>)."

The cholinergic SPC was previously identified as the trigger for full spicule intromission, once the hermaphrodite vulva is breached.

Additionally, ablating SPC in conjunction with the post cloacal sensilla neuron PCB results in ChR2-expressing males that do not ejaculate in response to light activation. We propose a model where the SPC, via direct cholinergic signaling to the gonad (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jarrell et al., 2012</a>), triggers the initiation of ejaculation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>).

We propose that the SPV and SPD help maintain a lower threshold in the SPC, allowing the SPC to trigger spicule intromission without inducing premature ejaculation. When the spicules tips enter the uterine environment, the SPV and SPD neurons further facilitate the SPC activity to begin sperm initiation. Thus, without the SPV and SPD present, the SPC cannot reach its peak activity as quickly as normal. This model accounts for the role of SPV and SPD in SPC activity and initial sperm movement."

Calcium imaging data presented in this work and ablation data in previous work suggest that the gubernaculum erector and retractor muscles, and possibly the anal depressor, are involved in the penultimate step of male mating (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). The gubernaculum erector and retractor are located dorsally to the spicules and attach the gubernaculum to the body wall (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The gubernaculum is a thin strip of cuticle material located dorsally from the spicules and is thought to assist in positioning the copulatory structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Sulston et al., 1980</a>).

Our data suggest the post cloacal sensilla PCA is partially responsible (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>).

We identified glutamate as a potential PCA neurotransmitter and showed that PCA's peak activity following intromission corresponds with gubernacular muscle contractions. Additionally, we showed that ChR2-expressing males were unable to ectopically ejaculate when PCA was removed. While ablating the PCA in a wild type mating background does not affect sperm transfer (<a href=\"#bib55\">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Liu et al., 2011</a>), we propose this is due to the ability of the other p.c.s. neurons, the PCB and PCC, which make similar muscular connections (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jarrell et al., 2012</a>), to compensate for the loss of the PCA. Both redundancy and the ability to compensate when one function has been impaired is reported in the male mating circuit in general and the p.c.s. neurons specifically (<a href=\"#bib55\">Liu and Sternberg, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Koo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">LeBoeuf and Garcia, 2012</a>). Additionally, p.c.s. function likely contributes to the ability of exceptional males lacking the SPV/SPD/socket cells to initiate sperm release. The synaptic connections they make to the gonad could function to prime this organ when the p.c.s. are active during prodding behavior, increasing the likelihood that impaired SPC function could nevertheless stimulate sperm initiation.

Once the effect of DA is slowly extinguished, the male is then able to mate again. The refractory period could indirectly cause males to mate with different hermaphrodites. However, the refractory period could also provide the gonad and male mating circuitry time to recover, as we observed that mating drive returns before mating potency (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>)."

One possibility is that different circuits involved in mating need varying times to re-set following the activities necessary for successful ejaculation. Strikingly, we noticed that a large number of neurons and other cells show a dramatic increase in calcium transients upon spicule insertion. This suggests that a large amount of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and hormones are released at intromission. While the large amount of information contained within these signals is required for sperm release, over a period of time they may have a dampening effect on the circuitry. Many receptors undergo periods of desensitization, and the large amounts of signals released near-simultaneously might compound this effect. The re-setting of circuits could require the removal of signaling molecules that inundate the male's nervous system during copulation. Thus, the receptors could return to functional levels required for subsequent mating. Additionally, calcium transients oscillate in the sex muscles following the initiation of sperm movement. While we do not know the purpose for these fluctuations, they could be in response to the signals released upon intromission, and their dampening is likely required for re-insertion. Thus, the high amount of circuit activity required for ejaculation might necessitate a similar period of reduced activity to restore proper circuit function."

When these neurons' sensory endings enter the uterus, their activity increases and consequently sperm initiation occurs. However, their activity decreases when they sense sperm release (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Consequently, the activity of the ejaculation circuit, which includes the SPC and socket cells, is also reduced. If the SPV and SPD do not sense intrauterine sperm, then their extended activity subsequently promotes the continued release of DA and other neurotransmitters. This could result in the lengthening of the refractory period. This hypothesis is based on the interesting observation we obtained when we prevented sperm from draining into the hermaphrodite but did not interfere with SPV and SPD function. This experiment resulted in a subpopulation of males that displayed an extended refractory period. Thus in intact wild-type males, if the SPV and SPD do not efficiently sense sperm in the uterine environment, a possible cause could be due to a low ejaculate sperm count. Consequently, lengthening the refractory period would allow time for the males to produce sperm."

In contrast, we identified that the refractory period in <i>C. elegans</i> is modulated by the circuitry located in the male tail. However, we cannot rule out a role for the head ganglia in regulating both ejaculation and the refractory period. We were unable to achieve optogenetically controlled ejaculation unless ChR2 was expressed in cholinergic head neurons. This suggests that, similar to other species, males' sexual activities are modulated by neuronal networks that are not directly associated with the sex organs."

This signal is sent to lumbar spinothalamic (LSt) neurons in the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib91\">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</a>). LSt cells then signal the neurons that control the emission and expulsion phases of ejaculation. The emission phase involves the secretion and movement of seminal fluids to the proximal urethra via seminal vesicle and vas deferens contraction. Once the ejaculate is in position, it is ejected from the penis in the expulsion phase that includes the rhythmic contractions of smooth muscle (<a href=\"#bib17\">Coolen, 2005</a>). <i>C. elegans</i> ejaculatory circuitry is similarly set up (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) and allows us to expand the general understanding of circuit control of ejaculatory and post-ejaculatory behaviors."

Once the <i>E. coli</i> spot was dry, \u223c10 two-day-old <i>unc-64(lf);lite-1(lf)</i> hermaphrodites were added to the plates and returned to the 20\u00b0C cultivation temperature used for <i>C. elegans</i> for at least 1 hr. \u223c15 min prior to the start of the experiment, both hermaphrodites and males were moved to room temperature to allow them to adjust. We noticed males do not mate well immediately after being transferred between different temperatures. <i>unc-64(lf);lite-1(lf)</i> hermaphrodites move too much for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. To prevent excessive movement without immediately killing them, a white-hot platinum wire was used to briefly touch their noses, thereby damaging the sensory neurons in the head and preventing basal movement and feeding. This procedure kept hermaphrodites from moving for a few hours before they died. Dead hermaphrodites cannot be used because they do not provide enough body turgor to the males and their flaccid cuticles make it difficult for males to locate the vulva. 2-days-old <i>unc-64(lf)</i> hermaphrodites were used for ease of spicule insertion into vulva. Males had a difficult time inserting into 1-day-old <i>unc-64(lf)</i> hermaphrodites and, while males easily inserted into 3-days-old <i>unc-64(lf)</i> hermaphrodites, males could not maintain insertion due to vulva flaccidity. After hermaphrodite preparation, agar containing the bacteria lawn was cut out and placed on a microscope slide. 1 one-day-old virgin male was then added and the whole assembly was transferred to a fluorescence-equipped Olympus BX52 microscope. Males were manually tracked and visualized using a 10X, 20X, or 40X long working distance objective. The G-CaMP and DsRed signals were recorded simultaneously using a Dual View Simultaneous Imaging Systems with an OI-11-EM filter (Photometrics, Surrey, BC, Canada) and Hamamatsu ImagEM Electron multiplier (EM) CCD camera. The recordings were not started until the male had commenced mating and were stopped when the male retracted his spicules."

Additional ROIs of the same size were placed on the <i>E. coli</i> lawn to record the background fluorescence levels for each image. The mean gray level of each ROI was calculated for each frame, with the ROIs being moved frame-by-frame as necessary to keep the cells or tissues of interest inside the ROI as the male moved. Even though the male was situated at the vulva of an unmoving hermaphrodite throughout the recording, we found that even slight changes of position in the male tail necessitated moving the ROI. We were able to correlate fluorescent changes with behavior since both the spicules and sperm are auto fluorescent, allowing us to determine spicule insertion and sperm entry into the vulva."

Parts B and C are ok but Parts A and D are not readable and should be extensively revised. I recommend an overhaul of the schematic figures. Where the point to be made is highly anatomical (e.g. which muscles support ejaculation), keep the anatomical relationships intact in the diagram. However, where the points are circuit-related, uncouple the diagrams from anatomical representation. Don't make the cells or structures or muscles anatomically sized or arranged. In other words, move away from the strict anatomy and stylize the topography with some extra space between cellular and muscle elements. Use black and white and patterns: the colors are hard to discern. And please increase the size of the figures. Space is not a particular concern but readability is."

(2) The termination of an activity after a sense of fullness or satisfaction. We were not using the term in the same way that the rodent sexual behavior researchers currently use the term. The definitions for refractory period and satiation in mammals were added to the Introduction. In the manuscript we originally submitted, we used the term satiation to refer to the successful termination of a mating bout. However, the rodent studies use satiation to refer to the long term inhibition of copulation attempts after ad libidum mating. We do not know if <i>C. elegans</i> males ever undergo an extended period of mating inhibition due to excessive mating. To account for this, we removed all references to <i>C. elegans</i> satiation.
