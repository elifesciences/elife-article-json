Crystal structures have suggested that the conformational change from occluded to outward-facing states is unusually simple, involving only the rotation of a conserved glutamate (Glu<sub>ex</sub>) upon its protonation. Using <sup>19</sup>F NMR, we show that as [H<sup>+</sup>] is increased to protonate Glu<sub>ex</sub> and enrich the outward-facing state, a residue ~20 \u00c5 away from Glu<sub>ex</sub>, near the subunit interface, moves from buried to solvent-exposed. Consistent with functional relevance of this motion, constriction via inter-subunit cross-linking reduces transport. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the cross-link dampens extracellular gate-opening motions. In support of this model, mutations that decrease steric contact between Helix N (part of the extracellular gate) and Helix P (at the subunit interface) remove the inhibitory effect of the cross-link. Together, these results demonstrate the formation of a previously uncharacterized 'outward-facing open' state, and highlight the relevance of global structural changes in CLC function."

Crystal structures have suggested that the conformational change from occluded to outward-facing states is unusually simple, involving only the rotation of a conserved glutamate (Glu<sub>ex</sub>) upon its protonation. Using <sup>19</sup>F NMR, we show that as [H<sup>+</sup>] is increased to protonate Glu<sub>ex</sub> and enrich the outward-facing state, a residue ~20 \u00c5 away from Glu<sub>ex</sub>, near the subunit interface, moves from buried to solvent-exposed. Consistent with functional relevance of this motion, constriction via inter-subunit cross-linking reduces transport. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the cross-link dampens extracellular gate-opening motions. In support of this model, mutations that decrease steric contact between Helix N (part of the extracellular gate) and Helix P (at the subunit interface) remove the inhibitory effect of the cross-link. Together, these results demonstrate the formation of a previously uncharacterized 'outward-facing open' state, and highlight the relevance of global structural changes in CLC function."

Finally, the transporter takes on the 'inward-facing' shape to release the ions on the other side of the membrane. However, structural studies of CLCs suggest that the structures of these proteins do not change much while they are moving ions, which suggests that they might work in a different way."

The alternating access mechanism can only be realized by coupling of ion binding, translocation, and unbinding events to conformational changes in the transporter protein. Specifically, movement of ions between solution and the ion-binding sites of the transporter, as well as ion movement between binding sites, needs to be coupled to conformational changes between \u201coutward-facing\u201d (in which the external, but not internal, solution is accessible to ions), \u201coccluded\u201d (in which neither solution is accessible), and \u201cinward-facing\u201d (in which the internal, but not external, solution is accessible) states (<a href=\"#bib33\">Forrest et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Rudnick, 2013</a>)."

For the CLC transporters, in contrast, it has been proposed that the transport mechanism may be fundamentally different and involve only localized side chain motions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Feng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">2012</a>). However, this proposed mechanism is based largely upon the observation that no large-scale CLC conformational change could be detected crystallographically.

In this experimental setup, movement of a <sup>19</sup>F-labeled residue from a buried to a solvent accessible location would be detected by line-broadening and peak attenuation. We first examined whether any of the five buried tyrosine residues in ClC-ec1 exhibits sensitivity to TEMPOL. In \u201cBuriedOnly\u201d ClC-ec1, a mutant in which all five buried Tyr residues have been labeled with <sup>19</sup>F (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) effects of TEMPOL were observed at both low and high [H<sup>+</sup>], with apparently greater sensitivity at high [H<sup>+</sup>] (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>); however, because the <sup>19</sup>F resonances are overlapping, we were unable to unambiguously assign the observed changes specifically to effects on chemical shift or line-broadening of a particular resonance. Therefore, to clearly identify the residue(s) sensitive to TEMPOL, we generated ClC-ec1 constructs containing only one <sup>19</sup>F-Tyr label per subunit (either Y445 or Y419, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), replacing all other Tyr residues with Phe.

The <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum of Y419\u00a0only at pH 7.5 shows a single <sup>19</sup>F peak centered at 60 ppm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This peak shifts upfield and splits into two peaks when [H<sup>+</sup>] is increased, indicating that the <sup>19</sup>F nucleus has experienced a change in chemical environment. This result is consistent with our previous findings (<a href=\"#bib26\">Elvington et al., 2009</a>) further supporting the notion that conformational changes occur in the vicinity of Y419 as increasing [H<sup>+</sup>] promotes occupancy of the OF state in which Glu<sub>ex</sub> is protonated. The appearance of two peaks, at -61 and -63 ppm, indicates that the <sup>19</sup>F label on Y419 is experiencing two different environments. This could arise from two conformational states of ClC-ec1 or from a tyrosine ring flip that occurs slowly on the NMR timescale (&lt;&lt;1000\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib106\">Weininger et al., 2014</a>). While this information is useful in identifying Y419 as being in a region involved in H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change, the lack of comprehensive theory for interpreting <sup>19</sup>F chemical shifts in terms of structure motivates additional studies to provide more details on the nature of the conformational change. To evaluate whether there might be a change in solvent accessibility of Y419, we examined the effect of TEMPOL on the <sup>19</sup>F spectra of Y419only. Because of the steep distance dependence of nuclear relaxation enhancements mediated by paramagnets like TEMPOL, significant line-broadening requires the paramagnetic center to approach the target nucleus within less than ~10\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib101\">Teng and Bryant, 2006</a>). At pH 7.5, there is little sensitivity of the <sup>19</sup>F-Y419 signal to 100 mM TEMPOL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) which is consistent with the largely buried position of Y419 in the crystallographically captured state of ClC-ec1, i.e., 12\u201313\u2009\u00c5 from the protein surface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, at pH 4.5, significant line-broadening is observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), indicating exposure of Y419 to the bulk solution allowing a close approach, or direct contact, of the TEMPOL probe with the fluorine atom (<a href=\"#bib28\">Esposito et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Niccolai et al., 2001</a>). This H<sup>+</sup>-dependent change in accessibility is reversible, as demonstrated by the reappearance of the Y419 signal when pH is returned to 7.5 from 4.5 in the presence of 100 mM TEMPOL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The reproducibility of these experiments is shown in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>."

This excavation of the gates yields a narrow water-filled conduit through the transmembrane domain, which allows rapid Cl<sup>-</sup> throughput and abolishes H<sup>+</sup> coupling. Thus, it appears that the mechanism of Cl<sup>-</sup> flux through these variants involves channel-like diffusion that is independent of substrate-dependent conformational change. Consistent with this picture, our previous <sup>19</sup>F NMR data showed that E148A/Y445S ClC-ec1 (exhibiting the highest Cl<sup>-</sup> permeability among the channel-like variants) does not undergo the substrate-dependent spectral changes observed in the coupled ClC-ec1 transporters (<a href=\"#bib26\">Elvington et al., 2009</a>). In this channel-like background, Y419only exhibits a single NMR peak at ~-61 ppm, and this signal is sensitive to line-broadening by TEMPOL at both pH 4.5 and 7.5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The accessibility at pH 7.5 is surprising given that the crystal structure of channel-like ClC-ec1 variant E148A/Y445A superposes closely with WT (RMSD 0.52\u2009\u00c5) and indicates a buried position for Y419 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Jayaram et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). While in these studies we used variant E148A/Y445S, which has not been crystallized, the two variants are functionally similar (<a href=\"#bib46\">Jayaram et al., 2008</a>). In channel-like E148A/Y445S, the accessibility of Y419 to TEMPOL indicates that the channel-like ClC-ec1 variant adopts a conformation in solution different from that observed in the crystal structure and similar to the conformation adopted by WT at low pH."

We reasoned that this cross-linking would restrict the conformational changes responsible for the increased solvent accessibility of Y419 at low pH, and, if these conformational changes are functionally important, cross-linking should also reduce the efficiency of Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport. In the X-ray crystal structure, the C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance between the two Y419 residues (one in each subunit) is 8.8\u2009\u00c5, within striking range for potential disulfide bond formation. We found that Y419C forms spontaneous inter-subunit cross-links and, to our surprise, that these cross-links have no detectable effect on function (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since Y419 lies in the middle of a loop (the P/Q linker), we reasoned that loop flexibility may thwart the intended restriction of motion by the disulfide cross-link. To test this possibility, we examined cross-linking at D417, the residue immediately following Helix P, which also has an inter-subunit C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance of 8.8\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Like Y419C, D417C forms spontaneous inter-subunit disulfide cross-links, with ~50% of the protein migrating as a dimer on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, top panel). To determine the effect of the cross-link on function, we purified D417C transporters under reducing conditions, thereby obtaining a sample in which the majority (&gt;90%) of the protein was not cross-linked, and then induced varying amounts of cross-link by titrating with copper-phenanthroline (CuP) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom panel). We assessed the functional effect of cross-linking using a Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux assay (<a href=\"#bib104\">Walden et al., 2007</a>). These assays show that cross-linking at 417C correlates directly with a decrease in transport activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), with Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> transport inhibited in parallel (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

                                "text": "Since our NMR results indicated that the Helix P-Q region of channel-like ClC-ec1 adopts a conformation similar to that of WT at low pH (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we hypothesized that the conformational changes underlying the increased solvent accessibility of Y419 may also move the two D417 side chains out of the range for inter-subunit cross-linking. To test this hypothesis, we generated the D417C mutant in the channel-like background and evaluated its sensitivity to cross-linking. Consistent with our hypothesis, D417C in channel-like background does not form spontaneous cross-links and is only minimally cross-linked even when treated with up to 100 \u00b5M CuP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, top panel). Because this limited cross-linking of D417C/channel-like ClC-ec1 could be due to non-availability of the cysteines (due to oxidation) rather than lack of structural proximity of the two cysteine residues, we used a spectrophotometric assay to quantify the free thiols. Immediately after purification and before CuP treatment, essentially all of the 417C residues are available as free thiols (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, bottom panel). Therefore, the deficiency in cross-linking of 417C in the channel-like background compared to 417C in the WT background is not due to unavailability of the free thiols but rather because of a change in proximity of the two cysteines. After treatment with 100 \u00b5M CuP, 40% of the cysteines are available as free thiols (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Since only ~25% had been cross-linked, this result indicates that ~35% became oxidized to other (non-disulfide) species. Thus, oxidation to non-disulfide species competes with disulfide bond formation and therefore thwarts any attempt to increase the extent of cross-linking beyond ~25% with longer CuP treatments. To rule out the possibility that the crosslinking might be due to inter-dimer (rather than inter-subunit) disulfide bond formation, we examined D417C proteins on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column both before and after treatment with CuP and found that they ran as dimers (and not tetramers, as would occur in the case of inter-dimer cross-linking) (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). To the degree it can be cross-linked, D417C in channel-like ClC-ec1 is inhibited similarly to D417C in WT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Thus, movement of Helix P away from the position observed in the crystal structures is necessary for maximal activity in both transporter and channel-like ClC-ec1."

At pH 7.5, the distribution is dominated by a single peak at a distance shorter than 20\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Lowering the pH to 4.5 induces a shift to a peak at 20\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). The channel-like D417C-MTSSL exhibits an altered distance distribution profile compared to the WT background (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), suggesting that the protein adopts a different conformation. Notably, the D417C-D417C distance in channel-like is increased relative to that observed in the WT background at pH 7.5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>), consistent with the resistance of the channel-like protein to cross-linking (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). A decrease in pH does not shift the distance distribution as observed in the WT background, consistent with the loss of pH dependence in <sup>19</sup>F NMR experiments on channel-like ClC-ec1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, (<a href=\"#bib26\">Elvington et al., 2009</a>)).

Both in the absence and presence of cross-link, D417C binds Cl<sup>-</sup> robustly, with an affinity somewhat stronger than observed with WT (K<sub>d</sub> ~0.1\u20130.2 mM vs 0.6 mM) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>)."

                                "text": "The inhibition of channel-like ClC-ec1 activity by the D417C cross-link suggests that inhibition occurs via an effect on the Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeation pathway, given that channel-like ClC-ec1 transports only Cl<sup>-</sup> and not H<sup>+</sup>. But since this conclusion is based on experiments with the atypical channel-like ClC-ec1 \u2013 with high transport rate and a continuous water passageway connecting the two sides of the membrane \u2013 we sought to strengthen the conclusion by examining uncoupled transporters that display typical transport rates and lack a continuous passageway: (1) E148A, which lacks the critical Glu<sub>ex</sub> residue that acts both as an extracellular gate for Cl<sup>-</sup> and as a transfer-point for H<sup>+</sup> permeation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and (2) Y445S, which is mutated at the intracellular gate (<a href=\"#bib11\">Basilio et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). The E148A (Glu<sub>ex</sub>) mutant is similar to channel-like ClC-ec1 in that it transports only Cl<sup>-</sup>; however, it has a much lower turnover rate, comparable to WT (<a href=\"#bib3\">Accardi and Miller, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jayaram et al., 2008</a>). This slow turnover suggests that despite being uncoupled E148A still depends on conformational changes to catalyze transport, a view supported by both <sup>19</sup>F NMR and fluorescence-based experiments, which detect H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change in this mutant (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bell et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Elvington et al., 2009</a>). In contrast to D417C/channel-like ClC-ec1, we found that D417C in the E148A mutant background is readily cross-linked by CuP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Therefore, uncoupling through E148A alone does not alter the protein conformations sampled in solution as substantially as observed with channel-like (E148A/Y445S). The turnover rate of un-crosslinked D417C/E148A is quite low \u2013 as low, in fact, as the extrapolated value for the turnover of fully cross-linked D417C (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Nevertheless, cross-linking of D417C/E148A is associated with significant inhibition of activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This result is consistent with the conclusion that inhibition occurs via an effect on the Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeation pathway."

The double mutant D417C/Y445S transports Cl<sup>-</sup> at ~850\u2009s<sup>-1</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and H<sup>+</sup> at ~20\u2009s<sup>-1</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) yielding a Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> stoichiometry of ~43, similar to that of the Y445S single mutant (<a href=\"#bib104\">Walden et al., 2007</a>). Cross-linking of D417C/Y445S proceeds to ~70% and inhibits Cl<sup>-</sup> transport by ~60% (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), with extrapolation to 100% cross-linking yielding a turnover of ~0 (\u00b1 100\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). For H<sup>+</sup> turnover, it is difficult to judge whether there is a significant effect of the cross-link (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given the uncertainty in measuring such low H<sup>+</sup> fluxes (~20\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>), it may be that H<sup>+</sup> is inhibited to the same extent as Cl<sup>-</sup>, to a lesser degree, or not at all. In the latter cases, the cross-link would in effect \u201crescue\u201d ClC-ec1 coupling; such rescue could arise from an increase in Cl<sup>-</sup> occupancy at S<sub>cen</sub>, which is known to facilitate H<sup>+</sup> coupling (<a href=\"#bib2\">Accardi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Nguitragool and Miller, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Han et al., 2014</a>).

As an approach to examine the effect of the cross-link on H<sup>+</sup> transport, we used MD simulations to examine water entry into the hydrophobic region between Glu<sub>in</sub> and Glu<sub>ex</sub>, which is essential to connect these two major H<sup>+</sup>-binding sites and thus support H<sup>+</sup> transport (<a href=\"#bib57\">Kuang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Wang and Voth, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cheng and Coalson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Lim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Han et al., 2014</a>). Water entry occurs via a narrow portal on the cytoplasmic side of the protein, lined by Glu<sub>in</sub> together with E202 and A404 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Han et al., 2014</a>). Previously, we showed that constricting this portal by introducing large side chains at position 404 inhibits water entry detected computationally and H<sup>+</sup> transport detected experimentally (<a href=\"#bib38\">Han et al., 2014</a>). Since A404 is on the intracellular end of Helix P (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), restricting movement of this helix via the D417C cross-link might restrict water entry. To determine whether the D417C cross-link affects water entry, we compared the number of water molecules entering the central hydrophobic region during the simulation of cross-linked D417C compared to WT. In contrast to the A404L mutation, which greatly reduces water permeation through the portal (<a href=\"#bib38\">Han et al., 2014</a>), the D417C cross-link has no effect on water entry (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This result suggests that the cross-link reduces ClC-ec1 transport predominantly via an effect on the Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeation pathway rather than on the H<sup>+</sup>-permeation pathway."

To investigate the molecular basis of such motions, extensive MD simulations were conducted either in the absence or in the presence of the D417C cross-link. Note that even the hundreds of nanoseconds of simulations performed here can probe mainly conformational fluctuations of ClC-ec1 near its reference conformation (in this case, the crystal structure), which did not permit direct observation of the opening of the gates. Nevertheless, the sampled dynamics and fluctuations can provide information that can be used to derive collective motions, which are often functionally relevant (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bahar et al., 2010</a>). Collective motions are defined as those involving concerted movements of a large number of atoms distributed throughout the protein, and are therefore distinguished from localized conformational changes. A series of collective motions of a protein can be obtained in general by decomposing the fluctuations of a protein sampled through MD simulations, e.g., through principal component analysis, or by analyzing normal modes of the protein that underlie protein motions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bahar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gur et al., 2013</a>). Collective motions can further be used to probe how larger-magnitude conformational change along the identified displacement vectors (modes) might involve crucial, functionally-relevant protein motions, such as opening-closing movements of enzymatic active sites,\u00a0ligand-binding sites on receptors and channel pores (<a href=\"#bib100\">Tai et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Lou and Cukier, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Shrivastava and Bahar, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Liu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Jiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Isin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Peters and de Groot, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Yao et al., 2013</a>). For example, collective motions obtained from normal mode analysis (NMA) were used to project opening movements of potassium-channel pores (<a href=\"#bib93\">Shrivastava and Bahar, 2006</a>), and these predicted movements are consistent with those seen in single-molecule and X-ray crystallographic experiments (<a href=\"#bib92\">Shimizu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Alam and Jiang, 2009</a>). In this study, we identified collective motions in ClC-ec1 using principal component analysis (PCA) of the equilibrium MD simulations (see Methods), which in general identifies similar collective motions to those derived from NMA (<a href=\"#bib60\">Leo-Macias et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Skjaerven et al., 2011</a>). We then introduced deformations in the reference protein structure along each of the top 20 collective motions identified in our analysis (~75% of the motions observed in the equilibrium MD simulation). We then examined whether increasing the amplitude of these collective motions (which overcomes timescale limitations of the simulation) confer conformational change to the Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport pathway. We specifically examined regions around the extracellular and intracellular gates to the Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport pathway, where motions may lead to opening of either gate (which are both closed in the reference protein structure)."

A search over the 20 dominant collective motions obtained through the PCA of the entire WT MD simulation revealed that deformations along some of the collective motions increase the distances between these pairs by &gt;1.5\u2009\u00c5 and thus are coupled to gate opening. To conduct a statistical analysis of these motions, we divided the entire simulation trajectory into six blocks and determined the number of times such collective motions occur in each block (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, blue bars). An identical analysis performed on the MD simulation trajectory obtained from the cross-linked D417C mutant revealed that the motions that open the extracellular gate are dampened due to the cross-linking (P=0.002 \u2013 0.008) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, orange bars). The intracellular gate is formed by two key residues S107 and Y445 (<a href=\"#bib104\">Walden et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Accardi and Picollo, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Basilio et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

Unlike the extracellular gate, however, the cross-link at residue 417 does not significantly dampen the distance changes around the intracellular gate (P=0.338) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>)."

However, along this line of reasoning, one must reconcile why the E148A mutants, in which the extracellular gate has ostensibly been removed, are inhibited when the cross-link is introduced. To address this question, we first investigated the bottleneck for Cl<sup>-</sup> transport in ClC-ec1 based on the crystal structures. The radius profile of the ClC-ec1 Cl<sup>-</sup> transport tunnel, calculated using the program HOLE (<a href=\"#bib95\">Smart et al., 1996</a>), shows an extracellular bottleneck with a minimum radius of ~0.2\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Interestingly, the calculated radius profile for both the E148A mutant (lacking Glu<sub>ex</sub>) and the channel-like variant E148A/Y445A also reveal extracellular bottlenecks. (E148A/Y445A was evaluated rather than the E148A/Y445S construct used here because this is the only channel-like variant for which there is a crystal structure.) With minimum radii of ~0.9\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) these bottlenecks are still too narrow to allow Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation (r(Cl<sup>-</sup>) \u2248 1.81\u2009\u00c5) (<a href=\"#bib89\">Shannon, 1976</a>).

Visual inspection reveals an obvious potential transduction pathway: Helix N, which forms part of the extracellular gate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), makes direct contacts to Helix P through side-chain packing of conserved residues in each Helix (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A,B</a>). We hypothesized that disrupting these contacts would disrupt transduction of Helix-P motions to the extracellular gate, thereby abolishing the inhibitory effect of the Helix-P cross-link. To test this hypothesis, we generated Helix-N mutants F357A and L361A, in which the inter-helical coupling of motion is expected to be weakened by removing bulky side chains contributing to the contact area. The mutant transporters are slow compared to WT but retain the ability to couple Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Strikingly, the D417C cross-link only weakly inhibits L361A activity and completely fails to inhibit F357A (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C,D</a>). The sluggish turnover of the F357A mutant suggests that it might be insensitive to the D417C cross-link because it is already maximally inhibited. To evaluate this possibility, we examined another slow mutant, A404L. A404 lines an intracellular \u201cportal\u201d for water (and hence H<sup>+</sup>) entry into the transporter (<a href=\"#bib38\">Han et al., 2014</a>). This residue is located at the N-terminal end of Helix P (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig11\">11A</a>), which does not contact Helix N. We found that the activity of the A404L mutant, despite being similarly sluggish to F357A, is reduced further yet by the D417C cross-link (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E,F</a>). Thus, the lack of sensitivity of F357A to the D417C cross-link appears due to the weakened interaction with Helix P and not to its already-low turnover. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that Helix-P motions are transmitted to the extracellular gate via side-chain contacts to Helix N."

Second, H<sup>+</sup> binding promotes an \u201coutward-facing open\u201d (OF<sub>open</sub>) state, involving conformational rearrangement of Helices N and P (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>), that widens the extracellular ion-permeation pathway in comparison to the known crystal structures."

At pH 7.5, the lack of accessibility is consistent with the crystal structure of the occluded conformational state, which depicts Y419 in a buried position. At pH 4.5, the increased accessibility of Y419 indicates a conformational state different from that captured in crystal structures. This state (with Y419 exposed to solution) is observed in channel-like ClC-ec1 at both pH 7.5 and 4.5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This shift in equilibrium distribution of conformational states for channel-like ClC-ec1 is useful because it enables comparison of the disulfide cross-linking of the two states, which must be done at a pH that is amenable to disulfide bond formation (7.5 rather than 4.5). In the WT background, cross-links near Y419, at D417C, form readily (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), as expected based on the crystal structure of the occluded conformational state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). In contrast, in the channel-like E148A/Y445S background, D417C is resistant to cross-linking (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). These results suggest that the pH-dependent conformational change detected by NMR involves a change in inter-subunit proximity of D417 residues in addition to the change in solvent accessibility of Y419. DEER experiments confirm such pH-dependent change at D417 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>)."

Therefore, the conformational change being restricted is something other than the localized movements of side-chain gates, as these gates (E148 and Y445) are missing altogether in the uncoupled transporters. To gain insight into how conformational change near the subunit interface affects activity, we performed MD simulations on WT and channel-like ClC-ec1, with and without the D417C crosslink. We found that the major motions of both WT and channel-like involve opening of the extracellular vestibule and that these opening motions are dampened by the cross-link at D417 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a>,<a href=\"#fig10\">10</a>). Further, our mutagenesis experiments show that removing side-chain interactions between Helices N and P eliminates the effect of the cross-link on Cl<sup>-</sup> transport (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Therefore, we conclude that rearrangement of these helices facilitates a widening of the extracellular ion-permeation pathway."

However, an alternative interpretation is that the OF<sub>occluded</sub> is completely impermeant to Cl<sup>-</sup> and that the residual transport observed with the cross-link is either (1) not distinguishable from zero (due to compounding uncertainties in the various steps involved in the experimental measurement, including quantification of the fraction cross-linked) or (2) occurs because the cross-link does not completely prevent movement of Helix N and opening of the extracellular vestibule to the OF state. We favor the alternative interpretation as it is in keeping with the general principles of transporter function, in which protein conformational change plays a key role in sustaining coupling stoichiometry. In support of this idea, we note that Helix N motions have been strongly implicated not only in ClC-ec1 (the results presented here) but also in the mammalian antiporter CLC-4 (<a href=\"#bib76\">Osteen and Mindell, 2008</a>). Experiments on this homolog identified an inhibitory Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding site at the top of Helix N that appears to transmit conformational change to the Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeation pathway at the other end of Helix N (<a href=\"#bib76\">Osteen and Mindell, 2008</a>)."

Nevertheless, several pieces of information suggest that the overall motions, though long-range in effect, may involve rearrangements/reorientations of only a few Angstroms in magnitude. First, the cross-linking of Y419C, just 5\u2009\u00c5 away from D417C, does not inhibit function (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, any large movement of Helix P would likely have a major effect on water entry via the narrow portal that is the rate-limiting barrier for formation of water wires and H<sup>+</sup> transport (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Han et al., 2014</a>). Since our computational analysis indicates that cross-linking does not significantly affect water entry (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), Helix-P motion may involve only a small tilt or rotation that exerts a \u201clever-arm\u201d effect on Helix N and the Cl<sup>-</sup>-entryway. Third, previous inter-subunit cross-linking studies targeting Helices I and Q, and the H-I and I-J loops showed that simultaneously cross-linking these regions had no significant effect on function (<a href=\"#bib73\">Nguitragool and Miller, 2007</a>) and therefore argue against a major restructuring of the inter-subunit interface. Together, these results suggest that the rearrangements at Helices N and P are likely small in magnitude and do not involve the entire inter-subunit interface. This conclusion is in line with computational studies using normal-mode and functional-mode analysis, which showed the subunit interface remaining largely intact even as other regions of ClC-ec1 underwent global conformational changes to alternately expose Cl<sup>-</sup>- and H<sup>+</sup>-binding sites during the exchange process (<a href=\"#bib69\">Miloshevsky et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Krivobokova et al., 2012</a>). One of the mobile helices identified in these computational studies was Helix R, which has also been pinpointed in experimental studies of H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bell et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham et al., 2015</a>). Since Helix R extends from the center of the protein (where Y445 coordinates Cl<sup>-</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) out to the cytoplasmic solution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change characterized here, while not large in magnitude, may extend well beyond the immediate region around Helices P and N."

(<a href=\"#bib11\">Basilio et al., 2014</a>). Starting with the OF<sub>occluded</sub> state (State 1 in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>, reflecting the state captured in the E148Q crystal structure, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), a conformational change generates the OF<sub>open</sub> state (State 2). This conformational change is pH dependent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>,<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>) but need not be promoted solely by the protonation of Glu<sub>ex</sub>, as suggested by previous observations of H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational changes in Glu<sub>ex</sub> mutants (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bell et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Elvington et al., 2009</a>). The conformational change allows 2 Cl<sup>-</sup> ions to exit to the extracellular side (State 3). Entry of the protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> into the vacated permeation pathway (State 4) facilitates transfer of one H<sup>+</sup> to the intracellular side, via water wires and the internal H<sup>+</sup>-transfer site Glu<sub>in</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Accardi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Lim and Miller, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Lim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Han et al., 2014</a>). Upon unbinding of H<sup>+</sup>, the protein adopts the apo occluded conformation (State 5) which can then undergo conformational change to the inward-facing state (State 6, (<a href=\"#bib11\">Basilio et al., 2014</a>)). Binding of 2 Cl<sup>-</sup> from the intracellular side knocks Glu<sub>ex</sub> out of the S<sub>ext</sub>-binding site (State 7), which then allows H<sup>+</sup> binding from the extracellular side (back to State 1). This revised model is completely consistent with previous experimental observations, and the addition of new conformational states adds potentially key control points to the mechanism. First, the extracellular occlusion in State 7 assures no extra Cl<sup>-</sup> slips through during the step in which Cl<sup>-</sup> binds from the intracellular side. Second, we hypothesize that the OF<sub>open</sub> state lowers Cl<sup>-</sup> affinity and promotes Cl<sup>-</sup> release, as suggested by the increase in Cl<sup>-</sup>-binding affinity observed when formation of the OF<sub>open</sub> state is inhibited by the D417C cross-link (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>)."

Using a cross-linking strategy, Basilio et al. showed that transition to the inward-facing state involves motion of the intracellular half of Helix O.

ClC-ec1 eluted from the Superdex 200 column in Buffer A was diluted to 0.2 mg/mL (1.9 \u03bcM homodimer; 3.8 \u00b5M Cys-containing subunits) before addition of CuP. After an hour of incubation, 1 mM Na-EDTA (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) was added to terminate the cross-linking reaction. Cross-linking was visualized using SDS/PAGE (4\u201315% gradient gels) and staining with Coomassie brilliant blue (TCI America, Portland, OR). Cross-linking was documented using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) using the 700 nm channel. ClC-ec1 band intensities were quantified using NIH ImageJ software. Un-cross-linked ClC-ec1 runs as a monomer (apparent molecular weight ~36 kD) and cross-linked mutant as a dimer (apparent molecular weight ~64 kD). The fraction cross-linked was calculated based on the relative intensities of the dimer and monomer bands. For channel-like ClC-ec1, which exhibited a low efficiency of cross-linking, free thiols were quantified colorimetrically (Life Technologies Thiol and Sulfide quantification kit, T6060). During reconstitution into liposomes, most CuP-treated samples were dialyzed in buffer containing 1 mM DTT in order to avoid additional cross-linking during the dialysis step; this level of DTT was sufficiently low that it did not reduce D417C disulfide bonds that had already been formed. Mutant proteins D417C/F357A and D417C/L361A were reconstituted in the absence of DTT when crosslinked with 100 \u00b5M CuP, as an extra precaution to avoid disulfide-bond reduction in these samples."

From the first structures over a decade ago, the notion has emerged that a key event in the coupling of anion and proton movements is the sidechain rotation of a conserved \"external Glu\" residue (Glu<sub>ex</sub>) that opens a pathway for Cl<sup>-</sup> to the extracellular solution, thus converting an \"ion-occluded\" conformation to an outside-open one. The mechanistic centrality of this Glu<sub>ex</sub> movement is not in doubt, but the precise nature of the outward-open pathway has been mostly ignored, probably because anyone who has actually examined CLC structures can immediately see that it's got a problem: the pathway in structures of the presumed outward-open conformation connecting the central bound Cl<sup>-</sup> ion to external solvent is far too narrow for the ion to squeeze through. The necessity of \"protein breathing\" has been occasionally invoked, in a more-or-less handwaving spirit, to dismiss this issue as the field builds various models for anion-proton antiport."

Recent indicators that some sort of backbone rearrangement may be involved have previously been reported from Maduke's lab, using <sup><a href=\"#bib19\">19</a></sup>F NMR, and from Accardi's using crosslinking. Now the authors bear down on the problem in more detail. They identify a residue, buried in the known structures and distant from Glu<sub>ex</sub>, that appears to become water-exposed at low pH, where pathway opening occurs. Inter-subunit disulfide crosslinking of this position does not affect transport, but this 'negative' result is proposed to reflect flexibility of the loop on which the residue resides. They then test a nearby residue on TM Helix P, and find that crosslinking can also occur here, and that the extent of crosslinking (under fairly harsh oxidation conditions) is tightly correlated with transport inhibition. The proposal naturally emerges that pathway opening involves a movement of TM Helices in this region. The idea is then examined by molecular dynamics, which look for collective motion tendencies that would widen the external pathway. Such motions are found in TM Helices F and N, the latter of which contacts Helix P. These motions are suppressed in MD simulations of the crosslinked structure (directly determined by a crystal structure). Mutations that decrease steric contact between Helices N and P are then tested and are found to confirm the prediction that such a loss of contact should remove the inhibitory effect of crosslinking on transport."

In this conformation, as visualized by the MD simulations, the external pathway would open an additional 2 A, which would allow bound Cl<sup>-</sup> access to the extracellular solution. These suggested motions are small \u2013 much smaller than the 'rocking-banana' or 'elevator' conformational changes involved in conventional alternating-access mechanisms of other transporters \u2013 and the general view of a nearly 'solid-state' mechanism of antiport in CLCs remains valid in broad outline."

However, enthusiasm is dampened as there is no single piece of evidence that is completely convincing on its own. While the various parts are of high quality, they are also circumstantial and require extensive hand-waving arguments to hold together. There is no \"nail in the coffin\" type experiment that unambiguously proves their point. Furthermore, key experiments are missing and some of the results are inconsistent with the authors' interpretation and model. These inconsistencies weaken the logical connections between the observations and the authors' interpretation of the data. The following issues need to be addressed to clarify and strengthen the arguments."

Our original interpretation of this result was that, as the reviewers suggest, the cross-link in effect \u201crescues\u201d the mutation: as the Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport rate decreases, the stoichiometry increases. This effect does not violate any thermodynamic principles because at the maximal cross-linking (70%), the Cl<sup>-</sup>-turnover rate is ~300 s<sup>-1</sup>, the H<sup>+</sup>-turnover rate is ~20 s<sup>-1</sup>, yielding a stoichiometry of 16:1. This interpretation assumes that the Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport rate extrapolates to a low but non-zero value, such that at 100% cross-linking there is some Cl<sup>-</sup> transport remaining that is coupled to the H<sup>+</sup> transport. However, as the reviewers point out, given the uncertainty in measuring such low rates of H<sup>+</sup> transport (20 s<sup>-1</sup>), we agree that we likely overestimated our ability to conclude whether or not the cross-linking inhibits H<sup>+</sup> transport in D417C/Y445S ClC-ec1. We have therefore rewritten this part of the manuscript (subsection \u201cHelix P cross-link specifically affects the Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeation pathway\u201d, second paragraph) accordingly."

Qualitatively, the relative areas of the two peaks appear similar, suggesting a comparable population between the two pH states. The split in the NMR peak could arise either from two conformational states of ClC-ec1 or from a tyrosine ring flip that occurs slowly on the NMR timescale. Additional experiments would be needed to tease apart these possibilities, however, since the overall interpretation of the data remains the same regardless of the reason for the peak split, these experiments were not prioritized. For example, this could be probed further by a series of temperature experiments to see if the peaks would combine to a single peak at higher temperatures (perhaps supporting the ring-flip), but the inherent instability of the protein at low pH and higher temperature would make this experiment challenging. Alternatively, using a 4F-Phe at position 419 instead of Tyr could also shed light onto the issue, but assessing the functional significance of a Tyr to Phe mutation at position 419, and the additional challenge of generating a Y419F-only mutant, were beyond the scope of our efforts. Our goal in these experiments is simply to shift the conformational equilibrium to increase the population of the OF state. As described above, we now show H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change detected by DEER experiments on MTSSL-labeled D417C CLC-ec1 (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). In the WT background, the distance distribution of the label at 417C is clearly pH-dependent. Although in principle DEER can be used to quantify populations, the range of distances present precludes an accurate quantification of the populations.
