Depletion of RAD52 is synthetically lethal with defects in tumor suppressors <i>BRCA1, BRCA2</i> and <i>PALB2</i>. RAD52 also participates in the recovery of the stalled replication forks. Anticipating that ssDNA binding activity underlies the RAD52 cellular functions, we carried out a high throughput screening campaign to identify compounds that disrupt the RAD52-ssDNA interaction. Lead compounds were confirmed as RAD52 inhibitors in biochemical assays. Computational analysis predicted that these inhibitors bind within the ssDNA-binding groove of the RAD52 oligomeric ring. The nature of the inhibitor-RAD52 complex was validated through an in silico screening campaign, culminating in the discovery of an additional RAD52 inhibitor. Cellular studies with our inhibitors showed that the RAD52-ssDNA interaction enables its function at stalled replication forks, and that the inhibition of RAD52-ssDNA binding acts additively with BRCA2 or MUS81 depletion in cell killing."

Depletion of RAD52 is synthetically lethal with defects in tumor suppressors <i>BRCA1, BRCA2</i> and <i>PALB2</i>. RAD52 also participates in the recovery of the stalled replication forks. Anticipating that ssDNA binding activity underlies the RAD52 cellular functions, we carried out a high throughput screening campaign to identify compounds that disrupt the RAD52-ssDNA interaction. Lead compounds were confirmed as RAD52 inhibitors in biochemical assays. Computational analysis predicted that these inhibitors bind within the ssDNA-binding groove of the RAD52 oligomeric ring. The nature of the inhibitor-RAD52 complex was validated through an in silico screening campaign, culminating in the discovery of an additional RAD52 inhibitor. Cellular studies with our inhibitors showed that the RAD52-ssDNA interaction enables its function at stalled replication forks, and that the inhibition of RAD52-ssDNA binding acts additively with BRCA2 or MUS81 depletion in cell killing."

In contrast to the severe recombination and repair phenotypes observed in yeast, deletion of <i>RAD52</i> has only a mild effect on recombination in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rijkers et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yamaguchi-Iwai et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yanez and Porter, 2002</a>). Although it is clear that RAD52 is important for survival and uncontrolled proliferation of BRCA-deficient cancer cells, the molecular mechanism by which RAD52 allows BRCA-deficient cells to survive is unknown. The proposed mechanisms included the putative RAD52 recombination mediator function and its role in single-strand annealing pathway of homology-directed DSB repair (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lok and Powell, 2012</a>). Functional interactions between BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD52, as well as the ability of RAD52 to promote BRCA-independent cell survival, are commonly expected to involve HR-related mechanisms. The recent discovery that BRCA proteins act together with the Fanconi Anemia pathway to support and protect replication forks points to a potentially more complex scenario (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schlacher et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">2012</a>). Additionally, RAD52 cooperates with the structure-selective nuclease MUS81/EME1 to generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) essential for the recovery of stalled replication forks in the absence of the replication check point (<a href=\"#bib48\">Murfuni et al., 2013</a>)."

Putative recombination mediator activity of RAD52 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Benson et al., 1998</a>) should also require ssDNA binding. Therefore, if the cellular functions of the RAD52 protein depend on the ssDNA binding, then inhibition of the RAD52-ssDNA interaction should have similar consequences as RAD52 depletion. RAD52 forms an oligomeric ring (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kagawa et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lloyd et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Singleton et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stasiak et al., 2000</a>), where the primary ssDNA binding site is located in the narrow groove spanning the ring circumference (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lloyd et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mortensen et al., 2002</a>). We designated this ssDNA-binding groove as the feature to be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. While disrupting the protein-ssDNA interaction with small molecules presents a formidable challenge (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yap et al., 2012</a>) that has only been overcome in a handful of cases, the ssDNA binding groove of RAD52 (for reasons discussed below) is a promising target and is distinct from the ssDNA binding sites of other ssDNA binding proteins."

Initial HTS hits were biochemically validated in RAD52 functional assays and tested in two separate cellular assays. Two available high resolution crystal structures (PDB: 1H2I and 1KNO) of the conserved ssDNA-binding domain of RAD52 highlight the unique nature of this target (<a href=\"#bib58\">Singleton et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kagawa et al., 2002</a>). The ssDNA-binding region is continuous around the circumference of the ring and has shallow sub-pockets that are repeating in each monomer. While the truncated version of RAD52 in the crystal structures may differ from the full length RAD52, it likely recapitulates the structural features of the ssDNA-binding groove. Computational docking followed by all\u00a0atom-simulated annealing placed all identified RAD52 inhibitors into two distinct sub-pockets within the ssDNA-binding groove. Compounds <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> ((\u2212)\u2212Epigallocatechin) and <b><i>\u20186\u2019</i></b> (Epigallocatechin-3-monogallate) predicted to bind within the RAD52 ssDNA-binding site, inhibited the\u00a0formation of the RAD52-dependent DSBs in hydroxyurea (HU)-stressed, checkpoint deficient cells to the same level as RAD52 depletion. Moreover, <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> acts additively with the MUS81 depletion to kill cells treated with hydroxyurea (HU), which perturbs replication, and with checkpoint inhibitor UCN01. These data strongly suggest that the ssDNA binding activity of RAD52 is required for recovery of stalled replication forks in checkpoint deficient cells. We also show that <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> selectively kills cells depleted of BRCA2, further supporting the importance of the RAD52-ssDNA interaction in BRCA deficient cells and the potential therapeutic value of RAD52 inhibition. Finally, in order to validate the strength of our hypotheses about the structural nature of the RAD52-inhibitor complex, we developed a validated in silico screening campaign, based on our HTS results, using a library of four thousand natural products. We describe the discovery of <b>NP-004255</b>, a macrocyclic compound, which we show by NMR WaterLOGSY and biophysical assays to be a completely novel and effective inhibitor of the RAD52-ssDNA interaction. The implication of these findings for the discovery of novel therapeutics that specifically inhibit the activity of RAD52 is discussed."

                                "text": "To identify compounds that disrupt the RAD52-ssDNA interaction we adapted a previously developed FRET-based assay (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grimme and Spies, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grimme et al., 2010</a>) to the HTS format. The RAD52-ssDNA interaction is independent of sequence and involves a binding site size of 4 nucleotides per monomer (<a href=\"#bib58\">Singleton et al., 2002</a>). Our FRET-based assay relies on the ability of RAD52 to bind and wrap ssDNA around the narrow groove spanning the circumference of the protein ring (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grimme and Spies, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grimme et al., 2010</a>). F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) donor (Cy3) and acceptor (Cy5) fluorophores are positioned at the ends of a 30-mer ssDNA (Cy3-dT<sub>30</sub>-Cy5). When this ssDNA forms a stoichiometric complex with RAD52 (one 30-mer ssDNA molecule per one heptameric ring of RAD52), the two fluorophores are brought close to one another resulting in an increase in the FRET signal. The assay was successfully adapted to the 384-well plates HTS format. In each well, we recorded the fluorescence signal of the Cy3 dye, which was excited directly, and the signal of Cy5 dye, which was excited via the energy transfer from Cy3. The apparent FRET signal was then calculated as described in the Materials and methods. The separation between the positive control (a stoichiometric complex of RAD52 with Cy3-dT<sub>30</sub>-Cy5 substrate challenged with an\u00a0excess of unlabeled ssDNA (Poly dT100)) and the negative control (an unperturbed stoichiometric complex of RAD52 with Cy3-dT<sub>30</sub>-Cy5) initially resulted in a Z\u2019 factor of 0.66 when calculated for the whole plate. Further optimization increased the Z\u2019 factor calculated for the control rows in the screening experiments to 0.94, indicating excellent reliability of the assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Using this assay, we screened the MicroSource SPECTRUM collection, which contains 2320 drug and drug-like synthetic compounds as well as natural products, which represent a wide structural diversity and a range of known biological activities. The screening was carried out at 15 \u00b5M concentration of each compound in the library. Of the 2320 compounds examined, 96 were identified as preliminary hits. The results for a one plate in the collection are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> with initial hits that were validated in the follow up experiments highlighted in green. These preliminary hits were selected based on the criterion of their separation from the negative control (RAD52 + Cy3-dT<sub>30</sub>-Cy5) of at least 5\u2009S.D. The 96 preliminary hits were assembled into a 'cherry picked plate' and were tested in two more rounds of screening <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>. Compounds that showed reproducible and nearly complete inhibition were re-tested at a range of small-molecule concentrations. Seven of the compounds tested showed a promising decrease in FRET in the re-screening assays and six were selected for biochemical validation (shown in green). One compound was excluded due to a low molecular weight and promiscuous binding observed in the follow-up biochemical assays. Additionally, we selected six compounds that elicited the FRET values below the positive control. These molecules were expected either to be 'false positives' (i.e. molecules that are fluorescent in the Cy3 channel or interact with DNA) or to have a significant absorbance in the region of Cy3 emission and/or Cy5 excitation. We purchased 12 compounds and confirmed their chemical structures by 1D NMR. The identified compounds and their chemical structures are listed in the <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>."

                                "text": "To determine how the selected compounds affect the ssDNA annealing function of RAD52 we performed FRET-based annealing assays (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grimme et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Grimme and Spies, 2011</a>). These assays utilize two complementary single stranded 28-nucleotide-long substrates, which contain either Cy3 (T-28) or Cy5 (P-28) incorporated into the middle of the respective DNA strand. When the substrates are annealed by RAD52, the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes are separated by 3 base pairs and yield a high FRET signal (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Negative controls containing T-28 and P-28 with the compounds in the absence of RAD52 displayed no change in FRET suggesting the small molecules do not promote ssDNA annealing by themselves. The annealing reactions were initiated by mixing two half reactions and observing the change in FRET over time in the presence of varying concentrations of small molecules. An increasing FRET value over time indicates the\u00a0formation of the dsDNA duplex which brings the two dyes in close proximity (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Fitting the annealing data to a double exponential allowed us to calculate and compare the final extent of annealing at varying concentrations of each compound compared to RAD52 alone. We plotted the final extent of annealing vs the concentration of the compound and calculated an IC<sub>50</sub> of annealing inhibition. A full set of the annealing time courses recorded at different concentrations of <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> is shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. As the concentration of the compound increases, the final extent of annealing is reduced compared to RAD52 alone. Since we showed previously that ssDNA wrapping around the RAD52 ring is necessary for the most efficient annealing (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grimme et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Honda et al., 2011</a>), it was expected that a compound that interferes with ssDNA access to the ssDNA binding groove of RAD52 would compete with ssDNA annealing, thus shifting the equilibrium away from the dsDNA product. It is notable that the IC<sub>50</sub> values for DNA annealing were generally higher than IC<sub>50</sub> values for the ssDNA binding. We attribute this to the dynamic nature of the RAD52-ssDNA complex as well as to RAD52 ability to bypass regions of heterology and other obstacles during the homology search process (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rothenberg et al., 2008</a>). To confirm specificity of the two compounds (\u2018<b><i>1</i></b>\u2019 and \u2018<b><i>6</i></b>\u2019) selected for the in-depth follow-up characterization as disruptors of the RAD52-ssDNA interaction, we tested the ability of these compounds to interfere with the RAD52-dsDNA interaction, which involves a different site on the RAD52 ring (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kagawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grimme et al., 2010</a>). At the stoichiometric RAD52: dsDNA ratio, (1\u00a0nM dsDNA: 10 nM RAD52) the dsDNA is bent upon RAD52 binding, which allows us to distinguish the RAD52-bound and free dsDNA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, \u2018<b><i>1</i></b>\u2019 had no effect on the RAD52-dsDNA interaction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> open grey squares), which indirectly confirms its specificity for the ssDNA-binding groove of RAD52. In contrast, <i>\u2018<b>6</b>\u2019</i> was able to displace dsDNA from the RAD52-dsDNA complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> open grey squares). Dynamic light scattering experiments conducted in the presence of equimolar concentrations of each compound and RAD52 showed that the presence of these compounds neither breaks up the oligomeric ring of RAD52 nor causes protein aggregation (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Notably, this means that our compounds act differently from the RAD52 inhibitor 6-hydroxy-DL-dopa (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chandramouly et al., 2015</a>), which disrupts supramolecular assembly of the RAD52 protein. We further confirmed that the inhibition of the ssDNA binding does not occur due to aggregation of compounds as annealing FRET trajectories in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100 are identical to those in the absence of Triton X-100."

The RPA-ssDNA complex is a physiologically relevant substrate for the RAD52-mediated strand annealing. To confirm that compounds <i>\u2018<b>1</b></i>\u2019 and <i>\u2018<b>6</b>\u2019</i> can inhibit the RAD52 binding to and annealing of the RPA-coated ssDNA we added stoichiometric amounts of RPA (1 RPA per 30 nucleotides of ssDNA) to the FRET-based ssDNA binding/wrapping and ssDNA annealing experiments described above. RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity and extends the ssDNA to its contour length. In our assays such an extension manifests as a distinct FRET state of ~0.3, which is readily distinguished from a FRET state of ~0.48 of free Cy3-dT<sub>30</sub>-Cy5 ssDNA, as well as ~0.63 FRET of the stoichiometric ssDNA-RPA-RAD52 complex (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grimme and Spies, 2011</a>) for details).

Similarly, we confirmed that both \u2018<b><i>1</i></b>\u2019 and \u2018<b><i>6</i></b>\u2019 inhibit the RAD52-mediated annealing of RPA-coated ssDNA with the IC<sub>50</sub> values comparable to the inhibition of ssDNA annealing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>).

We utilized a layered approach involving docking and all atom-simulated annealing with explicit solvent, using a knowledge based force field (<a href=\"#bib37\">Krieger et al., 2004</a>). The long circular ssDNA binding groove of the\u00a0RAD52 oligomeric ring yielded excellent 'druggability' scores (~4.0), based on the pocket metric of Sugo et al., (<a href=\"#bib59\">Soga et al., 2007</a>). Docking approaches generally generate many potential poses, and many false positives. Initially, top scoring poses in either Triangle Matcher (placement), London dG (affinity scoring function) or MM/GBSA (physics based scoring) were retained for further analysis (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods section for details)."

We compared the different scoring metrics, such as Triangle Matcher placement scores followed by rescoring with the affinity function versus the computationally expensive force field-based ligand refinement and subsequent MM/GBSA scoring. The use of all atom simulations (including explicit solvent models), when combined with docking, has been shown to significantly boost docking procedures' ability to predict and rank compound affinities. Therefore, we can compare the differences in free energy changes due to ligand binding for each of the poses, an ability that is not all within the realm of classical docking procedures (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ellingson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Whalen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Warren et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Head, 2010</a>). Thirty four unique docking poses were selected for comparison for each compound. Comparisons of the results of the various scoring metrics for docking of ligands to the RAD52 complex showed a clear lack of consensus between the three methods, except for compound <b><i>\u20186\u2019</i></b>, which resulted in a single pose scoring the highest in all three methods. To determine which methodology consistently provides the most accurate scoring, we employed a conservative approach, in which the 34 selected top scoring complexes were further subjected to all atom-simulated annealing studies, using explicit solvent and salt conditions."

Compounds <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> and <b><i>\u20186\u2019</i></b> yielded complexes with unique binding sub-pockets or 'hotspots' along the RAD52 binding groove, suggesting that they may have distinct biological activities and/or efficacies with regard to their ability to compete with ssDNA binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

The SAEM method used here was specifically designed to capture these complex recognition parameters. Unlike the case of deeply buried waters that occur in many active site pockets of enzymes, the waters along the RAD52 ssDNA-binding groove are mostly not involved in productive interstitial H-bonding with the ligand, but rather, represent a van der Waals binding surface, suggesting opportunities for future ligand improvement."

                                "text": "In human cells, RAD52 may perform both limited recombination-mediator function in the RAD51-dependent pathway (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lok and Powell, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Benson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Feng et al., 2011</a>) as well as additional RAD51-independent roles (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lok and Powell, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Murfuni et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">McIlwraith and West, 2008</a>). One of these HR independent roles of RAD52 involves stimulation of MUS81/EME1-dependent DSB formation at replication forks stalled by hydroxyurea (HU) treatment in the absence of cellular checkpoints (<a href=\"#bib48\">Murfuni et al., 2013</a>). Since the most likely targets of these MUS81/EME1/RAD52-dependent DSBs are the DNA structures produced by RAD52 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Murfuni et al., 2013</a>), we expected this activity to depend on the RAD52-ssDNA interaction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). To confirm this, we assessed DSB formation in checkpoint deficient cells using the neutral comet assay. These assays monitor MUS81/EME1/RAD52-dependent DSB formation upon induction of replication stress by HU treatment in primary fibroblasts immortalized by hTERT expression and treated with UNC01 to inhibit CHK1 kinase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). Our data show that increasing amounts of <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> and <b><i>\u20186\u2019</i> </b>decrease the mean tail moment indicative of the decrease in the MUS81/EME1/RAD52-dependent DSB formation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Importantly, these inhibitors recapitulate RAD52 depletion by inhibiting RAD52-MUS81-dependent DSBs at stalled replication forks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013b</a>). Notably, even at 500 nM, <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> had the same effect of reduction in DSBs as siRNA depletion of RAD52. These data strongly support the idea that inhibiting the RAD52-ssDNA interaction in cells recapitulates the effects of RAD52 depletion with respect to its role at the distressed replication forks. It also confirms our previous supposition that the target of MUS81/EME1-mediated cleavage under these conditions are indeed the structures annealed by RAD52. Interestingly, the concentrations of <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> sufficient to inhibit the MUS81/EME1/RAD52-mediated DSBs correlate well with the IC<sub>50</sub> values for inhibition of ssDNA binding/wrapping in vitro (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a> with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b and e</a>). These values are significantly lower than those required for inhibiting annealing of short, complementary oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c and f</a>). Higher concentration of <b><i>\u20186\u2019</i></b> required to inhibit MUS81/EME1/RAD52-mediated DSBs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>) is likely due to the particular chemical nature of this compound, which is a promiscuous binder; not only does it interact with RPA and binds within the dsDNA binding site of RAD52, but has been identified as an inhibitor in 192 different HTS assays (<i>Pubchem</i>). We previously reported that concomitant depletion of RAD52 and MUS81 gives raise to the MUS81-independent DSBs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Murfuni et al., 2013</a>). In agreement with a specific activity towards RAD52, treatment of the MUS81-depleted cells with \u201c<b><i>1</i></b>\u201d resulted in an appearance of the MUS81-independent DSBs upon replication stress induced by CHK1 inhibition. Due to its lower capacity to inhibit the MUS81/EME1/RAD52-mediated DSBs, and its expected off-target effects, we have eliminated <b><i>\u20186\u2019</i></b> from further analysis and focused all our subsequent cellular studies on <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b>, which appeared more specific in our biochemical studies and had no Pubchem hits. The fact that none of the compounds we tested showed additive effects on DSBs with RAD52 siRNA depletion, suggests that the effect of these inhibitors is specific to RAD52 at least with respect to recovery from replication stress. Furthermore, accumulation of anaphase bridges, a phenotype associated with impairment of the RAD52-independent mitotic function of MUS81/EME1 was completely unaffected by inhibition of RAD52, whereas it was strongly stimulated by MUS81 silencing (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This observation strongly suggests that the suppression of the DSB formation is not due to direct inhibition of MUS81, but is mediated through RAD52 inhibition."

This approach should facilitate further discovery of novel drug lead <i>compounds</i> that possess similar or improved activities as '<b><i>1</i></b>' and '<b><i>6</i></b>', but with a\u00a0fundamentally different chemical space. Natural products have an unrivaled history in drug discovery, and often represent the first and most significant hits against a metabolic pathway. The AnalytiCon Discovery MEGx Natural Products Screen Library, which is the in silico version of an actual library of purified natural products from plant, fungal and microbial sources, was subjected to an in silico screening campaign (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>). The campaign was designed based on the ability to optimally minimize false positives and false negatives, and to maximize true positives and true negatives. More specifically, the experimental hits identified in the HTS campaign described above, constitute the true positives, while specifically selected decoy compounds constitute the true negatives. The details of this optimization approach, known as Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC), are described in the Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods section. The ROC procedure in this in silico screening study was designed to challenge the value of the docking and scoring methods by employing decoy compounds (so called 'DUDS' compounds; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods section), which possess similar chemical properties, but different topologies than true positives. Importantly, the ROC approach uses the experimental HTS hits to optimize the in silico screening assay <i>vis-\u00e0-vis</i> minimizing false positives (which are rampant in all docking-based in silico screening approaches). The ROC curve for '<i>1</i>' (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>) shows that the optimized in silico selection process is nearly ideal in separating false positives from true positives. Finally, anin silico screen of the AnalytiCon Discovery MEGx Natural Products data base resulted in 9 compounds that had poses with scores better than those of compound '<b><i>1</i></b>'. The best scoring of those structures was ordered from AnalytiCon Discovery GmbH (Potsdam, Germany) for in vitro inhibition studies. The compound that was identified, <b>NP-004255</b> is known as <i>corilagin</i>, and is a member of the class of secondary plant metabolites called <i>ellagitannins</i>. Corilagin is a macrocyclic ester consisting of three trihydroxylated phenolic moieties. <b>NP-004255</b> binds to RAD52 in a similar manner as '<b><i>1</i></b>' and '<b><i>6</i></b>', in that it uses a buried interstitial water network, and is able to adopt a conformation that fits nicely into the ssDNA binding groove (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d\u00a0and\u00a0e</a>). The binding and inhibitor activity of this prediction was validated by both NMR and FRET-based assays, as described below."

Analogously, RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation and its activity in human cells is facilitated by a recombination mediator, BRCA2 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Xia et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carreira et al., 2009</a>) with multiple RAD51 paralogs playing roles in ensuring assembly and stability of the active RAD51 nucleoprotein filament (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chun et al., 2013</a>). Whether, and how, human RAD52 substitutes for BRCA2 mediator activity remains unclear. Synthetic lethality between BRCA2 defects and RAD52 depletion suggests that either RAD52 is indeed a recombination mediator, or that it participates in an alternative pathway that becomes prominent in the absence of BRCA2 function, such as for example SSA (single-strand annealing) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Feng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lok and Powell, 2012</a>). More intriguingly, RAD52 depletion is also synthetically lethal with defects in BRCA1, a tumor suppressor that acts upstream of BRCA2 in HR and at the branch point in the DSB repair that promotes homology-directed DNA repair through HR or SSA over the NHEJ (non-homologous end joining) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Singleton et al., 2002</a>). It is unknown which pathway(s) allow survival and proliferation of BRCA-deficient cells. These pathways, however, have to depend on the activities or interactions of RAD52. We showed recently that human RAD52 plays an important role in allowing cellular recovery under conditions of pathological replication (<a href=\"#bib48\">Murfuni et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, a sub-pathway of HR that is Rad51 (Rhp51) independent, but Mus81/Eme1/Rad52 (Rad22) dependent has been described in yeast and represents an important mechanism of DNA repair during replication in fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib15\">Doe et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vejrup-Hansen et al., 2011</a>). Whether this pathway, at least in part, compensates for the BRCA-deficiency in human cells remains to be determined."

                        "text": "We chose to target the well characterized ssDNA binding activity of RAD52, which we expected to underlie RAD52 functions both in supporting replication and in promoting the survival of BRCA-deficient cells. The ssDNA-binding groove of RAD52 is an interesting target for small-molecule binding in that it spans the circumference of the RAD52 oligomeric ring and offers a repetitive pattern of potential binding pockets. This deep and circular groove surprisingly yields reasonable druggability scores, as described in the Results section. Nevertheless, it is a highly exotic cavity, and very distinct from enzyme and receptor pockets. The ssDNA binding groove consists of an alternating arrangement of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Twelve compounds that inhibit RAD52-ssDNA interaction identified in this study (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) are predicted to bind within the ssDNA binding groove of RAD52 ring. In retrospect, it is not surprising that molecules such as the current suite of polyphenols have high affinity for this cavity. Additionally, although there are a number of hydrophobic regions in the ssDNA binding groove, one does not see the kind of significant desolvation that is usually found in enzyme active sites. Nevertheless, a number of waters are revealed in the crystal structure, and are maintained in the docking simulations. However, the nature and importance of these water networks to ligand optimization is not known. It appears there is significant room for improvement in terms of matching the shape of the binding groove with the van der Waals surface of prospective ligands. It will be interesting to see whether such chemical space is extant or may be designed to optimize this unusual surface. The computational studies on the complexation of '<b><i>1</i></b>' and '<b><i>6</i></b>' with RAD52 indicate the presence of a ubiquitous layer of interstitial water interactions with RAD52, yet these ligands are almost completely shielded from bulk solvent. The presence of these extensive interstitial water contacts further complicates hypotheses concerning which, if any, RAD52 functional groups are dominating the binding energy contacts. Rather, it may be that our HTS-generated hits possess the right combination of Van der Waals shape complementarity, and the ability to be both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (with both interstitial waters and functional moieties) in the narrow DNA binding groove. Indeed, it may be that this shape complementarity and the ability to utilize the resident waters dominates the binding determinants (both for the identified ligands, as well as the native ssDNA substrate). Our iterative approach of compound discovery followed by the in silico screening was clearly successful in expanding the chemical space of our lead compounds, but more importantly provides a platform for strengthening the structure-activity relationship in an exceedingly challenging target pocket. Indeed, the discovery of the secondary plant metabolite, <b>NP-004255</b>, a macrocycle, as a means to effectively compete with a native substrate macromolecule (ssDNA and the ssDNA-RPA complex) may prove to be a new strategy in the field of disrupting protein-nucleic acid interactions. It has to be noted, however, that although our work provides a solid understanding of how shape complementarity and utilization of interstitial water networks drives complexation, there are limitations to these approaches. Specifically, the current experimental and computational studies do not address the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics that control ligand competition in the ssDNA binding groove. A fascinating aspect of the competition between small molecules and macromolecules for an extended and partially solvated binding pocket, as in RAD52, is the extent to which small molecules may exploit the potential enthalpy-entropy compensation of a large and floppy native DNA ligand. Additionally, residence times of lead compounds may be a critical factor in the successful design of therapeutic lead compounds. These factors will be addressed in the future studies that will be focused on the thermodynamics and kinetics of small molecule binding to the RAD52 protein, and in the studies that will confirm the ligand placement through high resolution structures."

This inhibitor interferes with RAD52 oligomerization and the supramolecular assembly by an unresolved mechanism. It may act by binding at the RAD52 monomer-monomer interface, or at a different site on the protein and act allosterically. The existence of the distinct classes of RAD52 inhibitors, exemplified by \u2018<b><i>1</i></b>\u2019 and 6-hydroxy-DL-dopa, suggests that disrupting the RAD52-ssDNA interaction or the integrity of the RAD52 oligomeric ring bears negative consequences for the RAD52 cellular functions. Considering that the efficient homology search and the DNA strand annealing requires the two complementary DNA strands (or the complementary ssDNA-RPA complexes) to be wrapped around the two different RAD52 oligomeric rings (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grimme et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rothenberg et al., 2008</a>), this is not surprising, and offers an exciting opportunities for development of more specific and potent agents for targeting recombination-deficient tumors."

                        "text": "Since the expected role of RAD52 in the recovery of stalled replication forks in the absence of cellular checkpoint is to produce an intermediate that can be cleaved by MUS81/EME1 nuclease, we predicted that the ssDNA binding/annealing activity of RAD52 is required to fulfill this role. As expected, we found that <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> and <b><i>\u20186\u2019</i></b> recapitulate inhibition of DSB formation by siRNA mediated RAD52 depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In the case of <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b>, 1 \u00b5M of the inhibitor was sufficient to achieve the same level in DSB reduction as siRNA treatment. Notably, no further inhibition was observed when the cells were treated with both siRNA and the small-molecule inhibitor suggesting that the effect is specific to RAD52. A higher concentration of <b><i>\u20186\u2019</i></b> was required to achieve the level of reduction in the RAD52/MUS81 dependent DSBs comparable with siRNA depletion of RAD52. This may be due to metabolic instability of this compound or due to potential off-target binding. For this reason, we placed an increased focus on <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b>. The ability of <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> to inhibit DSB formation, which is required for the recovery of damaged replication forks in checkpoint deficient cells confirms that the ability of RAD52 to bind ssDNA is required for MUS81-dependent cleavage at stalled replication forks. Moreover, it is consistent with the mechanism we previously proposed whereby, in these cells, RAD52 used its ssDNA-binding activity to create a substrate for MUS81/EME1 and to recruit this structure selective nuclease. Consistent with our previous finding (<a href=\"#bib48\">Murfuni et al., 2013</a>), RAD52 inhibition with <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> acted additively with MUS81 depletion eliciting an effect comparable with RAD52 depletion. At 1 \u00b5M concentration of the inhibitor, approximately 40% of untreated and 60% of checkpoint-deficient, HU treated cells were dead (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). This is notable because the inhibitor interferes only with the\u00a0biochemical function of RAD52, namely its ability to bind ssDNA, while leaving the protein itself and its cellular concentration unperturbed, and also because even temporary loss of this biochemical activity during the exposure to replication stress is sufficient to exert the additive effect on viability. This result also illustrates the potentially powerful utility of these inhibitors in elucidating the function of RAD52 in the cell. We observed that inhibition of RAD52 during replication stress, which is induced by blocking DNA synthesis in the absence of the CHK1 activity, in a MUS81 knock-down background results in a comparable effect on viability as the concomitant depletion of both proteins. This observation strengthens the hypothesis that loss of MUS81 and RAD52 produces an additive lethal effect on replication stress (<a href=\"#bib48\">Murfuni et al., 2013</a>) because, while RAD52 and MUS81 collaborate to resolve demised forks, MUS81 is subsequently required for resolution of recombination intermediates in a RAD52-independent pathway (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). More interestingly,<b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> was able to act at least additively with BRCA2 knock-down (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). An increase in cell death when BRCA2 depletion was combined with <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i> </b>was comparable to or even exceeded that of MUS81 depletion by siRNA. Notably, the effect of <b><i>\u20181\u2019</i></b> was further enhanced by replication stress induced by short HU treatment and concomitant CHK1 inhibition, as well as by a prolonged exposure to HU. Treatments inducing replication stress are widely used in cancer therapy (e.g. CPT, Gemcitabin). Therefore, RAD52 inhibitors could be useful in combination with drugs which elicit replication stress. Tumors in which MUS81 is mutated or downregulated have been described (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). While it is unclear whether the role RAD52 plays in supporting the\u00a0survival of the MUS81-deficient cells is akin to its role in supporting viability in the absence of BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2, RAD52 inhibitors may represent a new means of treatment for the MUS81-deficient tumors as well as the BRCA-deficient tumors. In addition to its obvious uses in cancer therapy, the RAD52-ssDNA binding inhibitors can be utilized as molecular probes to assist in distinguishing the cellular pathways that depend on the main biochemical activity of RAD52. RAD52 may act together with other HR proteins, such as RAD51 paralogs to ensure formation of the active RAD51 nucleoprotein filament during RAD51-dependent HR. An understanding of the common players which might bind RAD52 in the absence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 and how they are regulated in the BRCA-deficient cells may require development of specific inhibitors of RAD52 protein-protein interactions and/or combining our inhibitors with other treatments that challenge homology directed DNA repair and replication."

Initially, top scoring poses in either Triangle Matcher (Placement), London dG (affinity scoring function) or MM/GBSA (physics-based scoring) were retained for further analysis. Often the top scoring poses from each metric were highly distinct from one another, suggesting that a generally poor consensus between the different metrics used in this early phase of the work flow. This lack of consensus in the scoring of the possible ligand binding in the sub-pockets within the DNA-binding groove of RAD52 (PDB: 1KNO) motivated us to apply the much more computationally rigorous all atom-simulated annealing studies, which are detailed below. All lead ligands were subjected to docking using MOE 2013.08 to a portion of the DNA binding groove of RAD52 spanning nearly a quarter of the circumference (3 adjacent monomers of the protein ring). The top 30 poses for each docked and scored (London dG scoring function) were subjected to energy minimization with a rigid RAD52 receptor using the MMFF94x force field, followed by rescoring (in order to estimate the \u0394G of binding) of each distinct pose with the MM/GBSA methodology (<a href=\"#bib50\">Na\u00efm et al., 2007</a>), which includes an implicit solvation energy calculation and captures changes in the solvent exposed surface area of the pose, which is a highly parameterized version of the popular MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methodologies (<a href=\"#bib61\">Steinbrecher and Labahn, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wang and Kollman, 2000</a>)."

The curves were analyzed using the metric of the\u00a0area under the curves (AUC) (<a href=\"#bib14\">DeLong et al., 1988</a>). The scores of the poses for the most active compounds exhibited bimodal frequency distribution (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>), and the docking protocols\u2019 ability to distinguish between active compounds and decoys was verified (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). We have determined a protocol for sorting compounds of interest among a database that provides reliable results with high cutoff limits."

This work trails at least three other studies that have used similar HTS assays to identify RAD52 inhibitors (Huang et al., NAR, 2016; Sullivan et al., PLoS ONE, 2016; Chandramouly et al., Chem Biol 2015). This manuscript needs to address how the compounds identified in this screen compare to the compounds that were previously identified as RAD52-ssDNA binding inhibitors. Is this largely a confirmation of what has been seen previously, or does the current work uncover new molecular scaffolds? In addition, this paper largely concludes that compounds '1' and '6' disrupt RAD52-ssDNA binding. However, an alternative hypothesis may be that these compounds affect the RAD52 superstructure, as suggested in Chandreamouly et al. This hypothesis can be easily tested here. Finally, the cell biology work requires multiple controls prior to publication in <i>eLife</i>."

Knockdown of MUS81 in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> is clearly decreasing the amount of BRCA2 in cells, suggesting that BRCA2 alone may be causing the effects seen in this figure. It may be appropriate to either overexpress BRCA2 or otherwise use other siRNAs in order to retain BRCA2 to claim that MUS81 is needed for survival in the presence of this compound. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see if double knockdown of BRCA2 and MUS81 had an additional effect on survival. Also, in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, the t-tests have been performed between control knockdown cells and MUS81/BRCA2 knockdown cells with and without inhibitor. The more appropriate comparison would be between knockdown cells without and with inhibitor. Finally, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> is not very convincing.

This inhibitor interferes with the RAD52 oligomerization and the supramolecular assembly by an unresolved mechanism. It may act by binding at the RAD52 monomer-monomer interface, or at a different site on the protein and acts allosterically. The existence of the distinct classes of RAD52 inhibitors, exemplified by \u20181\u2019 and 6-hydroxy-DL-dopa, suggests that disrupting the RAD52-ssDNA interaction or the integrity of the RAD52 oligomeric ring bears negative consequences for the RAD52 cellular functions. Considering that the efficient homology search and the DNA strand annealing requires the two complementary DNA strands (or the complementary ssDNA-RPA complexes) to be wrapped around the two different RAD52 oligomeric rings (Grimme et al., 2010, Rothenberg et al., 2008), this is not surprising, and offers an exciting opportunity for development of more specific and potent agents for targeting recombination-deficient tumors."

(Huang et al., 2016) carried out an HTS campaign to identify 17 compounds that inhibit RAD52-mediated annealing in vitro with IC50 values ranging between 1.7 and 17 \u00b5M, which physically bind RAD52, and selectively, albeit at high concentrations, inhibit the single-strand annealing pathway of DSB repair over homologous recombination. In another study, Sullivan et al. (Sullivan et al., 2016) reported an in silico docking screen of a library of drug-like compounds. Among 36 predicted small-molecules, 9 compounds inhibited RAD52-ssDNA interaction in vitro, and 1 in cells. As with all previous publications, the authors screened different libraries, resulting in compounds that represent a different chemical space from those that emerged from our campaign. In addition to the high lipophilicity and relatively poor ligand efficiency of inhibitors discovered in previous campaigns, our work is deeply linked with solid structure-activity relationships based on the RAD52-ligand complexes (i.e. the current work moves from phenomenology to a definitive workflow to exploit the ssDNA binding pocket). Additionally, the use of large scale natural product screening using an in silico approach is highly innovative, and has yielded a successfully hit, which provides an enormous opportunity utilize this pharmacophore in future campaigns."

We agree that the experimental validation is needed to confirm the compound placement. However, the reason we did not carry out the analysis of a point mutant that would interfere with the compound binding is due to the nature of the compound-RAD52 complexes. The majority of the contacts are achieved through a shallow continuum of van der Waals interaction, and many are mediated by water molecules (i.e., the complexation is not analogous to classic enzyme and receptor pockets). Indeed, the very nature of the ssDNA binding groove presents unique challenges to direct attempts to parse the binding free energy contributions from the amino acid moieties. Our binding energy calculations suggest that none of the possible single mutants will have a significant effect on the compound binding, at least without destabilizing the protein. We have, however, another and more powerful validation of our compound placement: We applied our compound placement protocol (docking of the small molecules to the \u201chotspots\u201d along the ssDNA binding groove of RAD52 followed by refinement of receptor-ligand complexes with an all-atom simulated annealing energy minimization and ligand free energy re-scoring approach, using a knowledge-based force field in explicit solvent) to virtually screen a larger library of natural products. The campaign yielded 9 promising compounds, all very distinct in structure from our original hits. Extraordinarily, the natural product compound NP-00425 that emerged from the in silico screen of ~ 5K compounds and was selected for in vitro testing, yielded a promising hit that binds to RAD52 and competes with ssDNA binding, as confirmed by both our biophysical assays as well as NMR WaterLOGSY experiments. The strength of our method is that the docking, scoring and selection protocol was designed to enrich the true positive hits (the docked validated hits) and decrease the false negatives and false positives. Importantly, this manuscript fully describes an integrated and highly complementary HTS/in silico screening approach that worked wonderfully in producing structure based lead compounds. In short, the initial HTS screen provided the critical de novo structure activity relationship, while the in silico method clearly elucidated the key metrics that describe complexation in the ssDNA binding groove. These studies will provide a strong foundation for the discovery of novel antineoplastic therapeutics. We believe that the success of this virtual screening campaign, not only validates the original compound placement, but goes a step further, and demonstrates the enormous success of such an approach in producing bone fide hits in this exceedingly difficult target class."

Although we have previously shown that MUS81 and RAD52 can cooperate in supporting the replication fork recovery in the checkpoint-inhibited cells (Murfuni et al., 2013), MUS81 has multiple RAD52-independent functions, such as resolution of intermediates in M-phase. Loss of such MUS81 mitotic function may impact the viability of BRCA2-deficient cells. These new data may imply that BRCA2-deficent cells have to engage the MUS81-RAD52 route to deal with the demised replication forks, and, on the other hand, point to MUS81 as another potential target for small-molecule inhibitors to selectively kill BRCA2-deficent tumor cells."

Indeed, the very nature of the ssDNA binding groove presents unique challenges to direct attempts to parse the binding free energy contributions from the amino acid moieties.

This campaign resulted in the discovery of macrocycle inhibitor of RAD52 (NP-00425). Extraordinarily, the natural product compound that emerged from the in silico screen (of ~ 5K compounds), and was selected for in vitro testing, yielded a promising hit that binds to RAD52 and competes with ssDNA binding, as confirmed by both our biophysical assays as well as NMR WaterLOGSY experiments. The strength of our method is that the docking, scoring and selection protocol was designed to enrich the true positive hits (the docked R-compounds) and decrease the false negatives and false positives. Importantly, this manuscript fully describes an integrated and highly complementary HTS/in silico screening approach that worked wonderfully in producing structure based lead compounds. In short, the initial HTS screen provided the critical de novo structure activity relationship, while the in silico method clearly elucidated the key metrics that describe complexation in the ssDNA binding groove. These studies will provide a strong foundation for the discovery of novel antineoplastic therapeutics. Additionally, we feel that the discovery of NP-00425 and its ability to compete with ssDNA in a ssDNA binding groove of RAD52 will generate significant interest in a broad range of disciplines, and strongly enhances the impact of the current study."
