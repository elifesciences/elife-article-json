Some regulate their active counterparts but the structural principles of this regulation remain largely unknown. We report X-ray structures of <i>Trypanosoma brucei S</i>-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase alone and in functional complex with its catalytically dead paralogous partner, prozyme. We show monomeric <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC is inactive because of autoinhibition by its N-terminal sequence. Heterodimerization with prozyme displaces this sequence from the active site through a complex mechanism involving a <i>cis</i>-to-<i>trans</i> proline isomerization, reorganization of a \u03b2-sheet, and insertion of the N-terminal \u03b1-helix into the heterodimer interface, leading to enzyme activation. We propose that the evolution of this intricate regulatory mechanism was facilitated by the acquisition of the dimerization domain, a single step that can in principle account for the divergence of regulatory schemes in the AdoMetDC enzyme family. These studies elucidate an allosteric mechanism in an enzyme and a plausible scheme by which such complex cooperativity evolved."

Sequences are labeled according to NCBI GenInfo Identifier (GI) followed by the species. Alignment sections are labeled above according to taxonomy group. Non-conserved termini and insertions are removed from some sequences, with the numbers of omitted insertion residues that belong to unconserved positions indicated with brackets. Aligned sequences were ordered according to taxonomy, with the exception of protist sequences, which were split according to their similarity to other sequences in the alignment (Sphaeroforma arctica and Salpingoeca rosetta sequences are closer to metazoa than other protists) and to distinguish the Trypanosomatid group that contains prozyme sequences. Trypanosomatids were supplemented with sequences from additional species present in the NR database (Phytomonas sp. isolate EM1, Angomonas deanei, and Strigomonas culicis), and indicated prozyme sequences were extended to the N- or C-termini using TBLASTN (marked by *). The confirmed AdoMetDC domains were found to be fused to several additional domains in select sequences, including an AdoMetDC leader (pfam08132) in 35 plant sequences, an f-box-like domain (pfam12937) in one fungal sequence, pyridoxal-dependent ornithine decarboxylase (pfam02784 and pfam00278) in 9 apicomplexan and 3 plant sequences, and protein prenyltransferase alpha subunit repeat (pfam01239) in one Blastocystis sequence. The proline residue (T. brucei P31) that alters peptide bond isomerization upon activation belongs to the Trypanosomatid AdoMetDC sequence motif \"FEGPEK\" and is present in all complete fungal sequences, with a single exception from Vanderwaltozyma polyspora (XP_001646102.1). P31 was also present in all but 19 protist sequences, where it was replaced in all apicomplexans (11), choanoflagellates (2), Blastocystis (2), Perkinsida (1), Ichthyophonida (1), Apusomonadidae (1), and Capsaspora (1). Inspection of the multiple sequence alignment identified several residues that appeared to coevolve with the P31 in protist sequences (that have not lost the proline), including T104, N132, H172, and C269. The H172 coevolution also extends throughout fungal sequences, while the T104, N132, and C269 are restricted to a more limited subset. These residues occupy key positions in TbAdoMetDC with respect to the conformational changes that occur upon prozyme activation as described in the main manuscript."

Some regulate their active counterparts but the structural principles of this regulation remain largely unknown. We report X-ray structures of <i>Trypanosoma brucei S</i>-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase alone and in functional complex with its catalytically dead paralogous partner, prozyme. We show monomeric <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC is inactive because of autoinhibition by its N-terminal sequence. Heterodimerization with prozyme displaces this sequence from the active site through a complex mechanism involving a <i>cis</i>-to-<i>trans</i> proline isomerization, reorganization of a \u03b2-sheet, and insertion of the N-terminal \u03b1-helix into the heterodimer interface, leading to enzyme activation. We propose that the evolution of this intricate regulatory mechanism was facilitated by the acquisition of the dimerization domain, a single step that can in principle account for the divergence of regulatory schemes in the AdoMetDC enzyme family. These studies elucidate an allosteric mechanism in an enzyme and a plausible scheme by which such complex cooperativity evolved."

Sequences are labeled according to NCBI GenInfo Identifier (GI) followed by the species. Alignment sections are labeled above according to taxonomy group. Non-conserved termini and insertions are removed from some sequences, with the numbers of omitted insertion residues that belong to unconserved positions indicated with brackets. Aligned sequences were ordered according to taxonomy, with the exception of protist sequences, which were split according to their similarity to other sequences in the alignment (Sphaeroforma arctica and Salpingoeca rosetta sequences are closer to metazoa than other protists) and to distinguish the Trypanosomatid group that contains prozyme sequences. Trypanosomatids were supplemented with sequences from additional species present in the NR database (Phytomonas sp. isolate EM1, Angomonas deanei, and Strigomonas culicis), and indicated prozyme sequences were extended to the N- or C-termini using TBLASTN (marked by *). The confirmed AdoMetDC domains were found to be fused to several additional domains in select sequences, including an AdoMetDC leader (pfam08132) in 35 plant sequences, an f-box-like domain (pfam12937) in one fungal sequence, pyridoxal-dependent ornithine decarboxylase (pfam02784 and pfam00278) in 9 apicomplexan and 3 plant sequences, and protein prenyltransferase alpha subunit repeat (pfam01239) in one Blastocystis sequence. The proline residue (T. brucei P31) that alters peptide bond isomerization upon activation belongs to the Trypanosomatid AdoMetDC sequence motif \"FEGPEK\" and is present in all complete fungal sequences, with a single exception from Vanderwaltozyma polyspora (XP_001646102.1). P31 was also present in all but 19 protist sequences, where it was replaced in all apicomplexans (11), choanoflagellates (2), Blastocystis (2), Perkinsida (1), Ichthyophonida (1), Apusomonadidae (1), and Capsaspora (1). Inspection of the multiple sequence alignment identified several residues that appeared to coevolve with the P31 in protist sequences (that have not lost the proline), including T104, N132, H172, and C269. The H172 coevolution also extends throughout fungal sequences, while the T104, N132, and C269 are restricted to a more limited subset. These residues occupy key positions in TbAdoMetDC with respect to the conformational changes that occur upon prozyme activation as described in the main manuscript."

These \u2018pseudoenzymes\u2019 are estimated to represent up to 10% of human encoded proteins, and are particularly abundant within the protease and kinase families. The roles of pseudoenzymes have been delineated in only specific cases, but the general principles by which they might contribute to organismal fitness remain incomplete. An interesting hypothesis emerges from the fact that many enzymes form functional oligomers (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goodsell and Olson, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Marianayagam et al., 2004</a>). This property leads to the idea that pseudoenzymes might generally evolve to serve as regulators of enzymes, directly interacting with their cognate active homolog to exert regulatory control."

Spermidine is essential in all eukaryotes for hypusine modification of the translation elongation factor eIF5A by deoxyhypusine synthase (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dever et al., 2014</a>). As a consequence the polyamine biosynthetic pathway has been targeted for development of anti-proliferative agents, including for the treatment of HAT (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jacobs et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Willert and Phillips, 2012</a>). The AdoMetDC pyruvoyl group plays a key role in the catalytic mechanism and derives from an autocatalytic processing reaction that cleaves the peptide backbone into \u03b2- and \u03b1-chains (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pegg, 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bale and Ealick, 2010</a>)(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Trypanosomatid AdoMetDC undergoes this cleavage, while the corresponding pseudoenzyme, which we call \u2018prozyme\u2019, lacks key residues and is not processed to the active form (<a href=\"#bib52\">Willert and Phillips, 2012</a>). Prozyme is only found in the trypanosomatids. The <i>T. brucei</i> AdoMetDC/prozyme complex is a heterodimer, whereas <i>T. brucei</i> AdoMetDC (<i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC) alone forms a homodimer only at high concentrations (<a href=\"#bib48\">Velez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Willert et al., 2007</a>).

Some evidence for allosteric regulation has also been reported for human AdoMetDC where the polyamine putrescine has been shown to stimulate both processing to form the pyruvoyl cofactor and also enzyme activity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pegg, 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bale and Ealick, 2010</a>).

The structures show that the inactive monomer is autoinhibited by residues in the N-terminus and that a coupled set of conformational changes are required to relieve the autoinhibition leading to <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC activation by prozyme. These structural movements include a <i>cis</i>-to-<i>trans</i> proline isomerization that facilitates positioning of the N-terminal \u03b1-helix into the heterodimer interface and an accompanying \u03b2-sheet reorganization. Our studies provide an example of how a pseudoenzyme can mediate allosteric control of enzyme activity through a mechanism involving multiple distributed conformational changes. Interestingly, comparative analysis of the AdoMetDC family shows that structural features responsible for this mechanism are present in other eukaryotic AdoMetDC enzymes, providing a model for how such a complex cooperative mechanism could arise through a process of stepwise variation and selection."

The G30-P31 peptide bond is in the <i>cis-</i>conformation, orienting S27-G30 into the active site. This configuration places F28 within 3.8 \u00c5 of the pyruvoyl overlapping with the active site of the previously reported <i>Hs</i>AdoMetDC structure (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ekstrom et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the equivalent peptide bond in <i>Hs</i>AdoMetDC (<i>Hs</i>G9-T10) is in the <i>trans</i>-conformation, and the N-terminus extends away from the active site, positioning <i>Hs</i>F7 (equivalent to <i>Tb</i>F28) to form one wall of the substrate-binding site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC\u039426 autoinhibitory residues are well defined by electron density and form extensive interactions in the active site stabilizing the observed conformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These interactions include, \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking between F28 and Y243 and H-bonds between the side chain of E85 and the backbone amide of S27, and between the amide of G101 and the carbonyl of E29. P31 is conserved throughout the trypanosomatid AdoMetDCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Taken together with the specificity of the observed interactions between the autoinhibitory sequence and the active site, these data strongly support the conclusion that the autoinhibition observed for the truncated monomer will also form the structural basis for inactivity of the full-length <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC monomer."

The <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC/prozyme complex was previously shown to be a dimer in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Velez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Willert et al., 2007</a>), thus the tetramer is unlikely to be relevant to its catalytic function. Both apo- and CGP-<i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC/prozyme structures contain ligands bound at identical sites between the \u03b2-sheets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In prozyme, the electron density is consistent with a bound putrescine (Put\u2019) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>); however, in <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC the corresponding electron density is larger and the crystallization buffer bis-tris propane (B3P) was modeled into the site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The CGP-<i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC/prozyme structure additionally has CGP bound in the active site and a second putrescine (Put) found in a novel site near the N-terminal \u03b1-helix (h1) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

This movement is facilitated by <i>cis</i>-to-<i>trans</i> isomerization of P31. The <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC N-terminal \u03b1-helix (h1, residues S7-R19) then docks into the heterodimer interface stabilizing the open conformation of the active site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5A</a>)."

While the scaffolding \u03b2-sheets and connecting coils and helices (<i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC residues <i>Tb</i>189-356) align closely between the heterodimer and monomer structures (RMSD of 1.1 \u00c5 for 168 equivalent C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atoms), the \u03b2-chain and \u03b1-chain residues <i>Tb</i>87-179 forming the pyruvoyl \u03b2-sheet and connecting coils and helices show significant deviations (RMSD of 5.1 \u00c5 for 145 equivalent C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atoms) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). The two <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC \u03b2-strands (\u03b27 and \u03b28) closest to the dimer interface show the most significant movement undergoing a nested set of \u03b2-strand slips. As a unit, \u03b27 and \u03b28 experience a shift in H-bond register of 3 residues relative to \u03b26 while additionally slipping by 2 residues (in-register) relative to each other (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Relative to \u03b26, the position of \u03b27, \u03b28 and connecting loop translates towards the dimer interface, while \u03b27 and \u03b28 flip to reposition the side chains from one surface to the other. In the heterodimer residues on \u03b27 (F163, F165) and \u03b28 (Y173, L175) have flipped away from the h1 binding site to pack against the scaffolding \u03b2-sheet, whereas residues on the other face (\u03b27: I164, I168 and \u03b28:H172, F174, Y176) have reoriented towards h1. The two residue slip between \u03b27 and \u03b28 leads to an elongation of the \u03b27-\u03b28 connecting loop so that the combined effect is that residues in these strands and connecting loops undergo 8\u201315 \u00c5 migrations between the monomer and heterodimeric structures. The elongated loop (G166-H172) forms direct interactions with prozyme across the interface including a salt bridge between <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC D169 and prozyme residues (K156\u2019 and H163\u2019) and an H-bond with Y152\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The reorganization of \u03b27 and \u03b28 propagates across the sheet leading to reorientation of the catalytic base C100 (strand \u03b25) in the active site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The analogous residues in <i>Hs</i>AdoMetDC (C82) and in <i>T. cruzi</i> AdoMetDC were previously demonstrated to function as general acids during catalysis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kinch and Phillips, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Xiong et al., 1999</a>)."

Together with adjacent disordered residues (Q139-P142) this loop reorganizes in the heterodimer to form two short 3<sub>10</sub>-helices (h6: P136-E138 and h7: G141-L144) that align with similar helices in <i>Hs</i>AdoMetDC (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Residues in the loop migrate over 15 \u00c5 and new interactions between h6 and h1 are formed. These include an edge-to-face stacking interaction between W137 and F20, while repositioning of h8 allows the\u00a0formation of an H-bond between R154 and D171\u2019, likely stabilizing the dimer interface. Coupled with these changes E29 from the autoinhibitory sequence undergoes a 5 \u00c5 shift to H-bond with the backbones of S134 and F135 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

We previously showed that residues in the conserved trypanosomatid AdoMetDC N-terminus (L8, L10, M11, and M13) contributed to activation by prozyme and that the loss in activity of these mutants could be partially restored by putrescine (<a href=\"#bib48\">Velez et al., 2013</a>). Extensive interactions are formed between these N-terminal <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC residues and amino acids in both <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC and prozyme (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). Furthermore, the active conformation is likely stabilized and perhaps regulated by pathway metabolites since putrescine is bound in the h1 helix pocket forming H-bonds with both h1 residues and residues forming the h1 binding pocket, such as H172 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D,E</a>).

As described above the data supported placement of a buffer molecule B3P into the site in <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC while putrescine was modeled into the prozyme site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This ligand-binding site is at the identical position in the two paralogous subunits. Important conserved contacts with ligand are made by <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC/prozyme\u2019 E36/E42\u2019, W125/W126\u2019, D189/D195\u2019, and D306/282\u2019. However a number of amino acid residues (e.g. S187/E193\u2019 and S185/R191\u2019) differ between them and these differences enlarge the binding pocket in <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC compared to prozyme. The binding of B3P is likely an artifact of the crystallization conditions and suggests that the larger pocket observed in <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC has lower affinity for putrescine than the corresponding pocket in prozyme, thus allowing putrescine to be outcompeted by the buffer present in 25-fold excess over putrescine in the crystallization drop (50 mM B3P versus 2 mM putrescine)."

Within this complex evolutionary background, the trypanosomatids underwent a gene duplication event leading to the prozyme regulatory mechanism. Though prozyme is only found in the trypanosomatids we sought to determine if the potential for AdoMetDC to be allosterically regulated arose only in the trypanosomatid lineage or whether it was an earlier invention of the AdoMetDC enzyme family. By combining structural insight into the prozyme regulatory mechanism with a\u00a0phylogenetic analysis of the enzyme family, we sought to find evidence for coevolution of residues involved in the activation mechanism and thus to determine if aspects of the allosteric regulatory mechanism were conserved in other eukaryotic AdoMetDCs.

We have shown that prozyme activates trypanosomatid AdoMetDC through an allosteric mechanism involving extensive conformational changes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC is maintained in the low activity state in the absence of prozyme by autoinhibitory residues positioned in the active site by the <i>cis</i>-conformation of P31. Upon formation of the heterodimer, P31 undergoes a <i>cis</i>-to-<i>trans</i> isomerization, and helix h1 is docked into the dimer interface. This isomerization positions the autoinhibitory residues into the open configuration of the substrate-binding site leading to enzyme activation. Reorganization of the <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC pyruvoyl \u03b2-sheet and nearby loops is required to form the h1 binding site. The buried surface that is created by the prozyme-induced conformational changes leads to structural stabilization of the alternative conformation and to expanded biological function through enzyme activation. Left unresolved is the question of whether or not these conformational changes occur by a sequential or a concerted mechanism. While our observance of the autoinhibitory sequence in the inactive monomer was in the context of an N-terminal truncation our conclusion that the inactivity of full-length monomeric <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC is caused by auto inhibition is supported by the following observations: (1) the autoinhibitory sequence makes a number of specific interactions with residues in the active site expected to stabilize the conformation, (2) biochemical data shows that the N-terminus is necessary for the activation mechanism, (3) both P31 and the N-terminal amino acid sequence are conserved in the trypanosomatids and, (4) the highly coupled nature of the observed conformational changes links displacement of the autoinhibitory sequence to the structural reorganization that forms the h1 binding site."

(<b>A</b>) The inactive <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC monomer is composed of two \u03b2-sheets: pyruvoyl (blue) and scaffolding (light blue). The active site pyruvoyl residue (<i>Pvl</i>86, star) is blocked by the inhibitory sequence (S27\u2013G30), which is oriented into the active site by the <i>cis</i> configuration of P31. This autoinhibitory closed confirmation is stabilized by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between F28 (purple) and Y243 (blue). Residues N-terminal of S27, including helix h1 (purple rectangle), were not present in the monomer construct and their position in the diagram is hypothetical. (<b>B</b>) Binding of prozyme (yellow/light yellow) to AdoMetDC is nucleated by formation of the H-bond network between the two scaffolding sheets leading to formation of a continuous inter-subunit \u03b2-sheet that serves as a platform for the following conformational changes: (<b>a</b>) slipping of the interface strands \u03b27 and \u03b28 relative to \u03b26, which results in flipping of their side chains from one surface to the other; (<b>b</b>) repositioning and elongation of the \u03b27-\u03b28 loop that forms the back of the h1 binding site, stabilized in this confirmation by interaction across the interface with prozyme; and (<b>c</b>) disordered-to-ordered transition and movement of the \u03b26-h8 loop (H130-L144, orange) that leads to formation of the h1 binding pocket. (<b>C</b>) Upon the formation of the h1 binding pocket, (<b>a</b>) <i>cis</i>-to-<i>trans</i> isomerization of P31 displaces the autoinhibitory sequence from the active site and the open active site conformation is stabilized by (<b>b</b>) docking of the h1 helix at the dimer interface.

In the case of <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC we identified several regions of the monomeric structure that are either in strained conformations or disordered, and which are likely to play key roles in promoting the observed conformational changes. These include the <i>cis</i>-P31 peptide bond that isomerizes to form the more energetically favorable <i>trans</i>-P31, disordered surface loops that undergo a disordered-to-ordered transition, and \u03b2-strands that slip and flip during the monomer to heterodimer transition to form new favorable interactions. Within these \u03b2-strands one residue (I168) in the monomeric structure is in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot, suggesting that relief of the strain in the I168 backbone may also contribute energetically to the conformational reorganization. Backbone strain has previously been associated with allosteric control of catalytic activity, though has most often been found in active site residues (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jia et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Oruganty et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly it has also been previously noted that cis-<i>trans</i> proline isomerization is often associated with the evolution of new function when, like in the case of TbAdoMetDC, the new function uses the isomerization to drive a local conformational change (<a href=\"#bib24\">Joseph et al., 2012</a>)."

Sequence analysis shows that a proline residue equivalent to <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC P31 and several other residues that are important for the prozyme activation mechanism are present in fungal and protist AdoMetDCs indicating that the allosteric mechanism likely arose early in eukaryotic evolution. Indeed, our analysis suggests that aspects of this regulatory mechanism may be retained in some extant fungi and single-cell eukaryotes but that it was lost in higher eukaryotes including animals and plants. As the dimerization domain is at the center of the structural rearrangements (\u03b2-strands reorganization and formation of the helix-binding site) that we observed in <i>T. brucei</i> AdoMetDC our data support the hypothesis that allostery in the eukaryotic AdoMetDC enzymes likely arose through the\u00a0acquisition of this domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

Indeed, it has been proposed that novel molecular interactions (like dimerization) and then allostery can gradually evolve by a stepwise explorative process, given mechanisms that locally concentrate proteins (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kuriyan and Eisenberg, 2007</a>). We further suggest that the evolution of complex allostery is facilitated by single-step acquisition of larger structural elements or domains (e.g. the AdoMetDC dimerization domain) through gene fusion events and that complex allosteric mechanisms may be unlikely to arise through point mutation alone."

The structural changes that the authors have discovered are substantial and fascinating. Specifically, they previously identified an inactive paralog of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) in the genome of Trypanosoma brucei. They also reported that the activity of TbAdoMetDC is greatly increased when mixed with the inactive paralog, which they call prozyme. The current work investigates the structural basis for the increase in activity. Three X-ray structures were reported: 1) an N-terminal truncation of the TbAdoMetDC monomer, 2) the TbAdoMetDC/prozyme heterodimer, and 3) the heterodimer with bound to CGP, a known inhibitor of AdoMetDC. The authors further explore the role of putrescine, a known activator of human ADoMetDC."

In addition to the structural data showing that these residues are bound in the active site of the N-terminal truncated <i>Tb</i>AdoMetDC, the biochemical and structural data on the full-length heterodimer also support the conclusion that residues 27-30 are autoinhibitory. First our mutagenesis data show that truncation or specific point mutation of the N-terminal 16 amino acids of AdoMetDC lead to loss of prozyme induced activation. Secondly this N-terminus is highly conserved in the trypanosomatids. These data implicate the N-terminus in the activation mechanism. The X-ray structural data of the full-length heterodimer shows that the N-terminus is bound into the interface, and its position in the interface effectively stabilizes the open conformation of the active site where the autoinhibitory sequence has been displaced. The displacement of the autoinhibitory sequence out of the active site in the full-length heterodimer (relative to the truncated monomer) is only one of the structural changes that were observed. Docking of the N-terminus is accompanied by major structural rearrangements that are required to form the N-terminal helix binding site and which also promote dimer contacts across the interface. These include \u03b2-strand reorganization and disordered to ordered loop transitions. Thus, the observed conformational changes are part of a coupled process involving not only the autoinhibitory sequence, but also these other conformational changes, supporting our conclusion that the inactivity of the monomeric structure is based on autoinhibition by residues near the N-terminus. The existence of a proline residue that is conserved in the trypanosomatids, and which undergoes a <i>cis-trans</i> conformational change from the monomer to dimer, also supports our autoinhibition mechanism since <i>cis-trans</i> proline isomerization has been observed in other auto-inhibitory sequences in other proteins and it is conserved in all of the trypanosomatids that utilize this allosteric mechanism, again supporting its role as described. So in short the highly coupled nature of the multiple conformational changes that were observed, all of which are centered on building a binding site for the N-terminus and for generating new contacts across the dimer interface and the conservation of the residues that are involved, make it highly unlikely that the observed auto-inhibition of the truncated monomer would be an artifact. We have added a discussion of these points into the manuscript into the first paragraph of the Results section and into the first paragraph of the Discussion section."

We think that this larger pocket likely has a lower affinity for putrescine than the pocket in prozyme and so because of the reduced affinity it was outcompeted by the buffer, which was present at 25-fold excess the concentration of putrescine. So indeed we do think that the binding of bis-tris was an artifact of the crystallization conditions and that the natural ligand is likely to be putrescine. This hypothesis is also supported by prior mutagenesis data on the <i>T. cruzi</i> enzyme. We have rewritten this section of the Results to provide clarification of these points."
