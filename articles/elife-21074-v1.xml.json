Chondrocytes experience a complex mechanical environment and respond to changing mechanical loads in order to maintain cartilage homeostasis. It has been proposed that mechanically gated ion channels are of functional importance in chondrocyte mechanotransduction; however, direct evidence of mechanical current activation in these cells has been lacking. We have used high-speed pressure clamp and elastomeric pillar arrays to apply distinct mechanical stimuli to primary murine chondrocytes, stretch of the membrane and deflection of cell-substrate contacts points, respectively. Both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 channels contribute to currents activated by stimuli applied at cell-substrate contacts but only PIEZO1 mediates stretch-activated currents. These data demonstrate that there are separate, but overlapping, mechanoelectrical transduction pathways in chondrocytes."

Chondrocytes experience a complex mechanical environment and respond to changing mechanical loads in order to maintain cartilage homeostasis. It has been proposed that mechanically gated ion channels are of functional importance in chondrocyte mechanotransduction; however, direct evidence of mechanical current activation in these cells has been lacking. We have used high-speed pressure clamp and elastomeric pillar arrays to apply distinct mechanical stimuli to primary murine chondrocytes, stretch of the membrane and deflection of cell-substrate contacts points, respectively. Both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 channels contribute to currents activated by stimuli applied at cell-substrate contacts but only PIEZO1 mediates stretch-activated currents. These data demonstrate that there are separate, but overlapping, mechanoelectrical transduction pathways in chondrocytes."

It is made of cells called chondrocytes that are surrounded by a scaffold of proteins known as the extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes regularly experience mechanical forces, which can arise from the movement of fluid within the joints or be transmitted to chondrocytes via the extracellular matrix. These cells sense mechanical forces by a process known as mechanotransduction, which allows chondrocytes to alter the composition of the extracellular matrix in order to maintain an appropriate amount of cartilage. If mechanotransduction pathways are disrupted, the cartilage may become damaged, which can result in osteoarthritis and other painful joint diseases."

This tissue is avascular and non-innervated and comprised of individual chondrocytes embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM). Production and homeostatic maintenance of cartilage structure is dependent on chondrocytes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hall et al., 1996</a>). Chondrocytes sense changes in the physical microenvironment and mechanical loading within the joints and adjust the balance of anabolic and catabolic processes to maintain the integrity and physical properties of the ECM (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buckwalter and Mankin, 1997a</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Goldring and Marcu, 2009</a>). Disrupting these homeostatic processes can lead to osteoarthritis (OA) whereby inappropriate activation of catabolic pathways leads to cartilage degradation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buckwalter and Mankin, 1997b</a>). It is therefore important to define how chondrocytes respond to mechanical stimuli and to understand how the sensitivity of the mechanotransduction pathways is modulated as both excessive and insufficient mechanical loading of the joint can lead to joint dysfunction."

Physiologically, the cartilage is subjected to a spectrum of mechanical inputs (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sanchez-Adams and Athanasiou, 2011</a>). Cartilage is regularly impacted by compressive forces that are initially carried by the fluid phase, before being transferred to the elastic ECM molecules within the tissue (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mow et al., 1980</a>). The movement of fluid within the joints also generates shear forces (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wong et al., 2008</a>), whereas tensile forces are transmitted to chondrocytes via the surrounding pericellular matrix (PCM) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Guilak et al., 2006</a>).

The cells attached and initially exhibited the spherical morphology typical of chondrocytes. Within 3 hr, the morphology of a subset of cells became more fibroblast-like as the cells dedifferentiated. We investigated whether the chondrocytes and the cells that had dedifferentiated in situ exhibited similar mechanoelectrical transduction properties in order to determine if these cells with distinct morphologies could be treated as a coherent sample. The application of stimuli to the chondrocytes evoked deflection-gated inward currents in 88.9% of cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (24/27 cells). Deflection-gated currents were also observed in dedifferentiated cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (88.2% (15/17 cells)). The kinetics of these currents suggested a channel directly gated by mechanical stimuli (chondrocyte currents: latency\u00a0=\u00a03.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 ms, activation time constant (\u03c4<sub>1</sub>)\u00a0=\u00a01.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 ms, dedifferentiated cell currents: latency\u00a0=\u00a03.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 ms, \u03c4<sub>1</sub> = 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 ms, mean \u00b1 s.e.m., n\u00a0=\u00a099 and 109 currents, measured across 24 chondrocytes and 15 dedifferentiated cells) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We found that both the latency and the \u03c4<sub>1</sub> values were significantly faster for currents measured in the dedifferentiated cells (Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.018, p=0.04, respectively). In addition, whilst no significant difference was noted in the \u03c4<sub>2</sub> values (p=0.19), the variance in the \u03c4<sub>2</sub> of currents measured in dedifferentiated cells was significantly higher compared to chondrocytes (F test, p&lt;0.0001, n\u00a0=\u00a0109 and 99 currents, respectively). These data demonstrate ion channel-mediated mechanoelectrical transduction in chondrocytes. Such measurements have previously proven impossible due to application of techniques incompatible with simultaneous patch-clamp analysis or that result in the destruction of cellular integrity before any mechanical activation of ion channels can be observed, such as cellular indentation of chondrocytes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee, 2014</a>)."

We found that stimuli within the ranges of 10\u201350 nm and 250\u2013500 nm produced significantly larger currents in the dedifferentiated cells, in comparison with chondrocytes (Mann-Whitney test, for the range 10 nm to 50 nm p<i>=</i>0.02 and for 100 nm to 250 nm p<i>=</i>0.004) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

As such, we determined whether removal of both PIEZO1 and TRPV4 had an additive effect on chondrocyte mechanoelectrical transduction, using miRNA to knockdown <i>Piezo1</i> transcript in <i>Trpv4<sup>-/-</sup></i> chondrocytes. In this case, significantly fewer cells (2/11) responded to deflection stimuli, compared with the WT chondrocytes treated with scrambled miRNA (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p=0.0002)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

In addition, the stimulus-response plot for <i>Trpv4<sup>-/-</sup></i>-<i>Piezo1</i>-KD cells highlights how little current activation was observed in the cells that responded to at least one stimulus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These residual currents likely resulted from an incomplete knockdown of <i>Piezo1</i> transcript. We then asked whether these data reflect two subpopulations of cells, expressing either TRPV4 or PIEZO1, using calcium imaging experiments. Chondrocytes were loaded with the Cal520 calcium-sensitive dye and perfused with 10 \u00b5M ATP to test for viability. After ATP washout, cells were perfused with the PIEZO1 activator Yoda1 (10 \u00b5M). All the cells that had responded to ATP also exhibited an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal when treated with Yoda1. Following Yoda1 washout, the cells were then perfused with the TRPV4 agonist, GSK1016790A (50 nM). All the analyzed cells exhibited an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal when treated with GSK1016790A (400 cells, from two separate chondrocyte preparations; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

Hypo-osmotic stimuli induce cell swelling (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lechner et al., 2011</a>), and it has thus been postulated that TRPV4 is activated by the resulting membrane stretch. Accordingly, we investigated stretch-activated currents in outside-out membrane patches isolated from chondrocytes. We first tested chondrocytes transfected with either a scrambled miRNA or the <i>Piezo1</i>-targeting miRNA. It was not possible to generate a pressure-response curve using this second data set, as there was insufficient current activation over the range of applied stimuli. As such, we compared the peak current amplitude measured in outside-out patches. We found that when <i>Piezo1</i> was knocked down the stretch-mediated peak current amplitude measured using HSPC was 4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 pA (mean \u00b1 s.e.m., n\u00a0=\u00a010), significantly smaller than that measured in patches pulled from chondrocytes transfected with scrambled miRNA, 72.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.3 pA (mean \u00b1 s.e.m., n\u00a0=\u00a011) (Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test, p=0.0002) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

We found that currents were observed in response to membrane-stretch but only in a subset of membrane patches (55%, 5/9 patches).

In cell-free patches, TRPV4 is no longer activated by warm temperatures\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib75\">Watanabe et al., 2002</a>). These data indicate that outside-out patches lack functional molecular components necessary for some modes of TRPV4 activation. As such, we next tested whether TRPV4 was activated by stretch in cell-attached patches. Similar to the results obtained in outside-out patches, TRPV4 did not respond to stretch stimuli applied using HSPC (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The overall TRPV4 stimulus-response data were significantly different than for PIEZO1 (two-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001). When we analyzed the current kinetics (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), we found that both the activation time constant (\u03c4<sub>1</sub>) and current decay (\u03c4<sub>2</sub>) were significantly faster for TRPV4-mediated currents, compared to PIEZO1-mediated currents; however, there was no significant difference in the latencies for current activation. These data are pertinent because the latency and the activation time constant (namely, latencies below 5 ms and activation time constants faster than 1 ms) have been used as parameters to classify channels that may be directly gated by a mechanical stimulus, in this case a deflection stimulus. These rapid latencies (&lt;5 ms) are distinct from the latencies of seconds to minutes measured for TRPV4 activation by osmotic stimuli, cell swelling, chemical activators (4\u03b1PDD) or heat (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lechner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nilius et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2003</a>). We next measured the current amplitude of deflection-activated TRPV4 currents at negative and positive potentials (\u221260 mV versus 60 mV) to determine if these currents were outwardly rectifying, as observed for activation of TRPV4 by 4\u03b1PDD, swelling and heat (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nilius et al., 2003</a>).

In situ, chondrocytes are subjected to physical stimuli propagated via the fluid phase of the cartilage, as well as via contacts between the cells and ECM. Mechanical loading within the joints leads to chondrocyte deformations and changes in cell volume, applying strain to the cells in situ\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Guilak et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alexopoulos et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Madden et al., 2013</a>). The transfer of mechanical loading to the chondrocytes themselves is modulated by the local mechanical environment, i.e. the local ECM structure and properties of the PCM\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib39\">Madden et al., 2013</a>). In vivo there exists a functional relationship between the PCM and the chondrocyte, together forming the chondron and changes in the composition or the mechanical properties of the PCM can lead to the development of OA (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexopoulos et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zelenski et al., 2015</a>). In this study, we have investigated mechanoelectrical transduction in isolated chondrocytes in response to deflections applied at the cell-substrate interface (to model stimuli transferred to the cells via matrix contacts) and to stretch applied to patches of membrane. We chose to directly monitor channel activity using electrophysiological techniques. Given that such an experimental approach requires access to the cell membrane, our studies have been conducted on chondrocytes in a 2D environment, as opposed to the 3D environment found in vivo."

Accordingly, chondrocyte mechanoelectrical transduction sensitivity to stimuli applied at the cell-substrate interface does not rival that of mechanoreceptor sensory neurons (known for their low mechanical threshold) but is comparable with the higher mechanoelectrical transduction threshold of nociceptive sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib55\">Poole et al., 2014</a>). Within the cartilage, chondrocytes are subjected to deformation but these shape changes are markedly different depending on the specific joint region\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib39\">Madden et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gao et al., 2015</a>).

We have noted this variability in all systems tested to date: sensory mechanoreceptive neurons, sensory nociceptive neurons, Neuro2A cells and HEK-293 cells heterologously expressing either PIEZO1 or PIEZO2. There are two likely reasons for this variability. Firstly, the pillar deflection stimuli are applied to a 10 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> contact area between the cell and the pilus, restricting the number of potentially activated domains and resulting in noisier data than methods where stimuli are applied over a larger area, e.g. indentation. Secondly, stimuli are applied via dynamic cell-substrate contact points, likely introducing additional confounding factors such as changes in the local mechanical environment dictated by adhesion molecules and the cytoskeleton. It is interesting to note that, despite clear differences in mechanosensitivity between chondrocytes and dedifferentiated cells measured using pillar arrays, no differences were observed when HSPC was used to apply pressure-stimuli to membrane patches. This phenomenon may reflect differences in the mechanical environment of the cell matrix contact points in the spherical chondrocytes versus the flattened edges of the dedifferentiated cells that display a more fibroblast-like morphology. These data suggest that the behavior of mechanically\u00a0gated channels in response to membrane stretch cannot be directly related to channel function when stimuli are applied via cell-substrate contact points and suggests that distinct pathways may mediate mechanoelectrical transduction within the cartilage in response to applied forces that stretch the membrane versus those forces propagated via movements within the matrix."

When we applied this conversion to our deflection data we obtained an average threshold for current activation of 63 nN in chondrocytes when deflection stimuli are applied to a 10 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> patch of membrane, i.e. approximately 2% of the cell surface. These data do not indicate the force that is transferred to the mechanically\u00a0gated ion channel, and this value for the restoring force will also be influenced by the mechanical properties of the cell at the cell-pilus contact. However, given that the elasticity of chondrocytes (approx. 1 kPa\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib71\">Trickey et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shieh and Athanasiou, 2006</a>)) is three orders of magnitude lower than that of the substrate (2 MPa(<a href=\"#bib55\">Poole et al., 2014</a>)), the influence of the mechanical properties of the cell on the restoring force will be minimal. These data allow a first comparison with earlier studies that investigated chondrocyte responses to compression. The calculated threshold for transduction in response to pillar deflection is almost 10x smaller than the compressive forces, applied to the whole cell, required in order to generate a robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (500 nN, (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee, 2014</a>)). This comparison suggests that current activation is more sensitive to deflections applied at the cell-substrate interface than to whole-cell compression."

In the light of recent work on TRPV4 and PIEZO1 in porcine chondrocytes, it has been proposed that TRPV4 responds to fine mechanical stimuli and PIEZO1 to injurious stimuli (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boettner et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, studies using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to measure mechanotransduction in response to substrate-stretch in urothelial cells found that PIEZO1 mediates cellular mechanosensitivity in response to smaller stimuli than TRPV4 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Miyamoto et al., 2014</a>). In both cases, the \u2018readout\u2019 of mechanotransduction is down-stream of the mechanoelectrical transduction event, monitoring alterations in matrix production (<a href=\"#bib51\">O'Conor et al., 2014</a>) or changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<a href=\"#bib51\">O'Conor et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Miyamoto et al., 2014</a>). As such, the relative differences in mechanosenstivity that depend on TRPV4 or PIEZO1 expression in the two systems could either reflect (a) differential modulation of channel sensitivity in distinct tissues by accessory molecules (as previously demonstrated for PIEZO1 [<a href=\"#bib55\">Poole et al., 2014</a>]) or (b) that the pathways downstream of the channel event amplify the signal in a differential fashion. These two possibilities are also not mutually exclusive. Our data suggest that, in chondrocytes, it is the downstream amplification of the original mechanoelectrical transduction current that differs, as we observed very similar effects on mechanoelectrical transduction sensitivity when either TRPV4 or PIEZO1 levels were ablated. Some care does need to be taken with this interpretation due to the fact that a specific TRPV4-antagonist acutely and reversibly blocked 87% of the deflection-gated current, yet chondrocytes from <i>Trpv4<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice did not display a similar reduction in current amplitude. We conclude that the chronic loss of one mechanosensitive channel in chondrocytes can be compensated for by other molecules, particularly given the fact that both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 were found to be active in all viable chondrocytes isolated from the articular cartilage. Such a conclusion supports the theory that there are multiple redundancies in mechanoelectrical transduction pathways (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arnad\u00f3ttir and Chalfie, 2010</a>) and highlights the possibility that potentially more mechanically\u00a0gated channels await discovery."

A recent paper has demonstrated that PIEZO1 gating can be directly mediated by changes in membrane tension in membrane blebs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cox et al., 2016</a>), suggesting an underlying mechanism for this stretch-mediated channel gating. In our experiments, when <i>Piezo1</i> transcript levels in chondrocytes were knocked-down using miRNA, stretch-activated currents largely disappeared, whereas a complete absence of TRPV4 did not significantly change the peak current amplitude nor the P<sub>50</sub>, in comparison with WT chondrocytes. This is a clear demonstration that current activation in response to membrane stretch cannot be used as an indicator of the overall mechanoelectrical transduction pathways within a cell. In addition, this observation highlights the impact of quantitative measurements of channel activity when precise stimuli are applied directly to a specific membrane environment, such as the cell-substrate interface."

We therefore addressed whether the two channels behave similarly in a heterologous system. We confirmed that TRPV4, unlike PIEZO1, is not efficiently gated by pressure-induced membrane-stretch, and demonstrated that TRPV4 is not activated by cellular indentation. It has previously been shown that TRPV4 can be gated by membrane-stretch in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Loukin et al., 2010</a>); however, the recording conditions used to demonstrate this effect all promote TRPV4 channel gating (holding potential\u00a0+\u00a050 mV, 20 mM Sodium Citrate and a pH of 4.5). Taken together with our observations, these data suggest that whilst TRPV4 can be gated by pressure stimuli, this process is not particularly efficient. However, we observed that HEK-293 cells expressing TRPV4 are more sensitive to mechanical stimuli applied at cell-substrate contact points than HEK-293 cells expressing PIEZO1. For TRPV4-expressing cells, the latency between stimulus and response (&lt;2 ms, indistinguishable from PIEZO1 expressing cells) and the activation time constant (&lt;0.5 ms, significantly faster than PIEZO1-expressing cells) suggest that, in response to deflection stimuli, TRPV4 is directly gated by the mechanical stimulus. These data directly address the long-standing question of whether TRPV4 is a mechanically\u00a0gated channel (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christensen and Corey, 2007</a>). A number of criteria have been proposed to determine whether a channel is mechanically\u00a0gated: the latency of current activation should be less than 5 ms (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christensen and Corey, 2007</a>), the channel should be present in mechanosensitive cells, ablation of the channel should eliminate the response, expression of the channel in a heterologous system should produce mechanically\u00a0gated currents and there should be an effect on mechanotransduction processes in vivo when the channel is deleted (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arnad\u00f3ttir and Chalfie, 2010</a>). As shown in this study, TRPV4-mediated current activation occurs with sufficiently rapid latencies. TRPV4 is expressed in the chondrocytes (along with other mechanosensory cells): its deletion leads to a reduction in mechanotransduction, in WT chondrocytes mechanotransduction currents are largely blocked by a TRPV4 antagonist and <i>Trpv4<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice are more likely to develop OA (although given the polymodal nature of TRPV4 these changes do not definitively reflect changes in mechanoelectrical transduction). In addition, we demonstrate here that TRPV4 mediates mechanically-gated currents in response to substrate deflections in a heterologous system. Whilst the loss of this channel does not produce a complete loss of current, the observed redundancy in mechanoelectrical transduction pathways suggests that this criterion is too stringent."

PIEZO1 has recently been shown to be inherently mechanosensitive\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib69\">Syeda et al., 2016</a>). In contrast, the data that we present here suggests that TRPV4 mechanosensitivity depends on the type of stimulus and the membrane compartment to which stimuli are applied. We speculate that differences in channel gating in response to physical stimuli applied to distinct membrane compartments represents a mechanism by which cells can promote mechanoelectrical transduction events to changes in the surrounding matrix without increasing cellular sensitivity to localized membrane stretch. As such, the direct measurement of mechanically\u00a0gated ion channel activity in response to stimuli applied via cell-substrate contact points is essential in order to understand how cells respond to changes in their immediate physical environment."

For example, mutations in Trpv4 have been implicated in skeletal dysplasia and joint dysfunction, and mice lacking TrpV4 are easily susceptible to osteoarthritis, a condition caused due to disrupted extracellular matrix homeostasis in chondrocytes. However, TRPV4 is a polymodal sensor activated by a variety of stimuli, and nailing down a role of TRPV4 mechanotransduction in vivo has been a challenge. On the other hand, Piezos are bona fide mechanically activated ion channels, but their role as the primary mechanotransducer in murine chondrocyte biophysics hasn't been explored yet."

As a first, they report mechanically activated currents recorded from primary murine chondrocytes, and show that Piezo1 and TrpV4 together mediate these currents. In primary chondrocytes and heterologous expression in HEK cells, Piezo1 can be mechanically activated by membrane stretch as well as stimulation of the cell-substrate interface, while TrpV4 is activated only when the cell-substrate is mechanically stimulated and not by direct membrane stretch. Thus suggesting that TrpV4 mechanical activation occurs only when the cell is mechanically stimulated via the extracellular matrix."

An alternative, and more relevant, conclusion is that TrpV4 is activated only when the cell membrane is stretched via the extracellular matrix and not by direct membrane stretch. One way to test this is to check if mechanical indentation of the apical membrane results in TrpV4 activation. If one doesn't see TrpV4 mediated currents then it only means that TrpV4 mechanical activation is dependent on the cell matrix, which could also explain why TrpV4 KO mice are more prone to osteoarthritis which is a result of disrupted ECM homeostasis. Beyond proving any mechanism, testing mechanical indentation for TrpV4 activation is important, as it is a very commonly used method for mechanotransduction, and it is important to compare to responses to deflections (as is already done with stretch)."

This is mainly based on the finding that TRPV4-dependent currents are activated by moving a pilus, but not in the HSPC experiments using outside-out patches. However, it is well known that in cell-free patches components that are critical for TRPV4 function are lost, which may well explain the absence (or rather, the small amplitude) of TRPV4-dependent currents in the HSPC experiments. For instance, it is known that TRPV4 loses heat sensitivity in cell-free patches (see Chung et al. JBC, 2003; Watanabe et al. JBC, 2002), so it is conceivable that TRPV4 can be activated by stretch, but that the responsiveness is lost upon patch excision. Thus, additional experiments comparing how Piezo and TRPV4 respond to membrane stretch in cell-attached patches would be necessary if the authors want to make the case that activation of TRPV4 in the pillar deflection experiments is not due to membrane stretch."

This calculation, based on Hooke's law, is in our opinion incorrect, as it only represents the force needed to deflect the pilus \"in isolation\". However, given that the pilus displacement activates a current in the cell, there must be a force applied from the pilus on to the cell and from the cell on the pilus. These forces depend on factors that are unknown, including the strength of the interaction between membrane and pilus (i.e. is the pilus tightly attached to the membrane patch, or rather rubs it), and the mechanoelastical properties of the cells, and thus invalidate the force estimations. In simple words, if the cell would be made out of concrete, the force to create a certain pilus displacement would be much higher than if the cell were made of butter. Thus, any conclusion on absolute force or differences in force threshold seems inappropriate at this point."

The real novelty lies in the direct mechanical activation of TRPV4. However, it would be ideal if this novel aspect of the work could be extended. For instance, the mechanosensitive current attributed to TRPV4 shows very rapid inactivation, which has not been described for this channel for any other stimulus, but is partly reminiscent of the properties of Piezo's. Description of some basic properties of the mechano-activated TRPV4-currents (e.g. voltage dependence of the inactivation, recovery from inactivation, selectivity etc.) would add to the novelty aspect of the manuscript."

While, the effect is additive when both Piezo1 and TrpV4 is knocked down simultaneously. This suggests that TrpV4 and Piezo1 are expressed in different cells. However, from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a> it appears that there is a reduction in currents in the remaining cells when either Piezo1 or TRPV4 is targeted. This is confusing. The first set of experiments suggest that Piezo1 and TRPV4 are expressed in mainly non-overlapping cells. If this was the case, one would not expect reduced current in other half when each is individually targeted. The authors should evaluate TRPV4 and Pieoz1 expression in individual chondrocytes and attempt to make sense of the recordings."

This is mainly based on the finding that TRPV4-dependent currents are activated by moving a pilus, but not in the HSPC experiments using outside-out patches. However, it is well known that in cell-free patches components that are critical for TRPV4 function are lost, which may well explain the absence (or rather, the small amplitude) of TRPV4-dependent currents in the HSPC experiments. For instance, it is known that TRPV4 loses heat sensitivity in cell-free patches (see Chung et al. JBC, 2003; Watanabe et al. JBC, 2002), so it is conceivable that TRPV4 can be activated by stretch, but that the responsiveness is lost upon patch excision. Thus, additional experiments comparing how Piezo and TRPV4 respond to membrane stretch in cell-attached patches would be necessary if the authors want to make the case that activation of TRPV4 in the pillar deflection experiments is not due to membrane stretch.</i>"

This calculation, based on Hooke's law, is in our opinion incorrect, as it only represents the force needed to deflect the pilus \"in isolation\". However, given that the pilus displacement activates a current in the cell, there must be a force applied from the pilus on to the cell and from the cell on the pilus. These forces depend on factors that are unknown, including the strength of the interaction between membrane and pilus (i.e. is the pilus tightly attached to the membrane patch, or rather rubs it), and the mechanoelastical properties of the cells, and thus invalidate the force estimations. In simple words, if the cell would be made out of concrete, the force to create a certain pilus displacement would be much higher than if the cell were made of butter.
