These concerns have led to questions about the reliability of science among the general public and within the scientific community itself. Particular themes include the low reproducibility of published findings in certain fields (<a href=\"#bib3\">Begley and Ellis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Nature Biotechnology, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Button et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fishburn, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2014</a>), ineffective peer review processes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eisen, 2011</a>), increasing rates of retractions of papers from academic journals (<a href=\"#bib32\">Steen, 2011</a>), and/or reluctance to publish negative results (<a href=\"#bib29\">Prinz et al., 2011</a>). Some commentators attribute these problems to a lack of scientific rigour or, in some cases, fraud (<a href=\"#bib30\">Resnik and Dinse, 2013</a>)."

Here we instead explore the subjective question of how the perceived decline in reproducibility and integrity has affected trust in the scientific enterprise. Biomedical science depends on a large network of trust among individuals and organisations, including the accurate reporting of data and observations, and the rigorous peer reviewing of publications and grant applications. Thus changes in the way individual scientists trust each other, or the enterprise as a whole, have major implications for the future of research."

Interviewees were more concerned about researchers overstating their findings or misrepresenting their data.

Overflow can be construed as both positive (more means better) and negative, but when it is observed most authors agree that overflow must be <i>managed</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Czarniawska and L\u00f6fgren, 2012</a>).

For example, in news agencies overflow is managed through selection, which is inherent in the profession of journalism (<a href=\"#bib8\">Czarniawska, 2012</a>). Gatekeepers who are experts in a given field rapidly and exactly apply their judgment (guided by appropriate criteria) to select the information that should be published.

Together, these results reveal a serious issue in the way our interviewees assess the quality of science. Many papers are written by scientists and labs that are simply not known to the established scientists. Similarly, much research is now published in new journals that lack an established track record. In each case reputational judgments of rigour and scientific importance are impossible. This lack of familiarity can lead to an unjustified lack of trust. The growing tension within some areas of science in recent years might be partly motivated by lack of familiarity, and a consequent inability to use professional reputations as a measure of trustworthiness, caused by overflow in the system."

There is a clear contradiction between these positions. Recent initiatives to introduce double-blind refereeing offer an apparent increase in objectivity, but this comes at the cost of a diminished ability for referees to assess the trustworthiness of authors (see, for example, <a href=\"#bib24\">Nature, 2015</a>). As overflow becomes more pronounced, this conflict becomes more problematic. The need for objective treatment of authors increases as more papers are submitted, but at the same time referees necessarily increase their reliance on subjective proxies such as reputation. It is very hard to see how these opposing forces can be reconciled in the current system."

As time passes and overflow increases, this erosion can only get worse. Possible alternatives include much wider use of pre-publication archives like arXiv or bioRxiv (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vale, 2015</a>), the replacement of some peer review with vetting by professional editors, shifting towards post-publication commentary fora such as PubPeer, and a shifted emphasis towards depositing primary data and writing fewer, more influential publications."
