We developed a physiological assay to monitor lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store refilling using specific activators of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to repeatedly induce lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. In contrast to the prevailing view that lysosomal acidification drives Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the lysosome, inhibiting the V-ATPase H<sup>+</sup> pump did not prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling. Instead, pharmacological depletion or chelation of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> prevented lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores from refilling. More specifically, antagonists of ER IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) rapidly and completely blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling of lysosomes, but not in cells lacking IP3Rs. Furthermore, reducing ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> or blocking IP3Rs caused a dramatic LSD-like lysosome storage phenotype. By closely apposing each other, the ER may serve as a direct and primary source of Ca<sup>2+</sup>for the lysosome."

We developed a physiological assay to monitor lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store refilling using specific activators of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to repeatedly induce lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. In contrast to the prevailing view that lysosomal acidification drives Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the lysosome, inhibiting the V-ATPase H<sup>+</sup> pump did not prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling. Instead, pharmacological depletion or chelation of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> prevented lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores from refilling. More specifically, antagonists of ER IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) rapidly and completely blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling of lysosomes, but not in cells lacking IP3Rs. Furthermore, reducing ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> or blocking IP3Rs caused a dramatic LSD-like lysosome storage phenotype. By closely apposing each other, the ER may serve as a direct and primary source of Ca<sup>2+</sup>for the lysosome."

Like the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Clapham, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berridge, 2012</a>), lysosomes are also intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores with free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub> ~0.4\u20130.6\u2009mM (<a href=\"#bib8\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>), which is 3\u20134 orders of magnitude higher than the cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (~100 nM). A reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub> is believed to be the primary pathogenic cause for some LSDs and common neurodegenerative diseases (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coen et al., 2012</a>). Using the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the lysosome has been shown to be required for late endosome-lysosome fusion (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pryor et al., 2000</a>), lysosomal exocytosis, phagocytosis, membrane repair, and signal transduction (<a href=\"#bib48\">Reddy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lewis, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kinnear et al., 2004</a>). Consistently, the principal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in the lysosome, Mucolipin TRP channel 1 (TRPML1 or ML1), as well as lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors such as the C2 domain\u2013containing synaptotagmin VII, are also required for these functions (<a href=\"#bib54\">Steen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lewis, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kinnear et al., 2004</a>). Whereas human mutations of <i>TRPML1</i> cause type IV Mucolipidosis, pathogenic inhibition of ML1 underlies several other LSDs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shen et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "How the 5000-fold Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration gradient across the lysosomal membrane is established and maintained is poorly understood. The most well understood Ca<sup>2+</sup> store in the cell is the ER. Upon store depletion, the luminal sensor protein STIM1 oligomerizes to activate the highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective ORAI/CRAC channels on the plasma membrane, refilling the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store via the SERCA pump (<a href=\"#bib9\">Clapham, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lewis, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berridge, 2012</a>). However, depletion of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores does not induce extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<a href=\"#bib19\">Haller et al., 1996b</a>). The endocytic pathway may theoretically deliver extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to lysosomes. However, most Ca<sup>2+</sup> taken up through endocytosis is lost quickly during the initial course of endosomal acidification prior to reaching lysosomes during endosome maturation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gerasimenko et al., 1998</a>). In various cell types, when the lysosomal pH gradient is dissipated, either by inhibiting the V-ATPase or by alkalizing reagents such as NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, free <i>luminal</i> [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub> was found to drop drastically (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calcraft et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dickson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shen et al., 2012</a>), with no or very small concomitant increase in <i>cytosolic</i> Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dickson et al., 2012</a>). These findings have been interpreted to mean that the proton gradient in the lysosome is responsible for actively driving Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the lysosome via an unidentified H<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morgan et al., 2011</a>). Because these findings are consistent with studies in yeast showing that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers establish the vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morgan et al., 2011</a>), this 'pH hypothesis' has been widely accepted (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calcraft et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Morgan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shen et al., 2012</a>). However, large, prolonged manipulations of luminal pH may interfere directly with Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporters, and secondarily affect many other lysosomal processes, especially lysosome luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dickson et al., 2012</a>), lysosome membrane potential, and fusion/fission of endosomes and lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mindell, 2012</a>). Therefore, these hypotheses about lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling and store maintenance remain to be tested under more physiological conditions. Directly measuring lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release has been made possible recently by using lysosome-targeted genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shen et al., 2012</a>) (GCaMP3-ML1; see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which co-localized well, in healthy cells, with lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp1), but not with markers for the ER, mitochondria, or early endosomes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Using the specific, membrane\u2013permeable synthetic agonists that we recently identified for lysosomal TRPML1 channels (ML-SA1) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shen et al., 2012</a>), we developed a lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling assay as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. In HEK293 cell lines stably-expressing GCaMP3-ML1 (HEK-GCaMP3-ML1 cells), bath application of ML-SA1 (30s) in a 'zero' (low; free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] &lt;10 nM) Ca<sup>2+</sup> external solution produced robust lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release measured by GCaMP3 fluorescence (\u25b3F/F<sub>0</sub> &gt;0.5; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The membrane-permeable form of the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA (BAPTA-AM) completely blocked the ML-SA1 response (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), supporting its Ca<sup>2+</sup> specificity. Importantly, GCaMP3-ML1-tagged lysosomes co-localized well with LysoTracker, indicating that the pH of these lysosomes was not different from lysosomes without GCaMP3-ML1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was completely blocked by the TRPML-specific, synthetic antagonists ML-SI1 or ML-SI3 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2I,J</a>). In addition, pretreatment with the lysosome-disrupting reagent Glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berg et al., 1994</a>) also completely abolished the refilling either in 'zero' Ca<sup>2+</sup> or in the presence of La<sup>3+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>), further supporting the lysosome-specificity of the response. The effect of GPN, presumably on so-called 'lysosomal membrane permeabilization', is known to be rapid and reversible (i.e. membrane 'resealing') (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kilpatrick et al., 2013</a>). Consistently, washout of GPN led to gradual recovery of ML-SA1 responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2K</a>). Similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling of lysosomes was also observed in GCaMP3-ML1-transfected human fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2L</a>), Cos-7 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2M</a>), primary mouse macrophages, mouse myoblasts, and DT40 chicken B cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013E</a>\u2019). These findings support the\u00a0idea\u00a0that these responses are mediated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from refilled lysosomal stores (also see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> for signals from individual lysosomes).

We therefore tested the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-specificity of GPN-induced increases on the Fura-2 and GCaMP3 signals. In cells pretreated with BAPTA-AM, whereas ER-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were abolished, GPN-induced Fura-2 increases were much reduced but not abolished\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B,C</a>). Consistently, in HEK-GCaMP3-ML1 cells pre-treated with BAPTA-AM, GPN still induced a significant increase in GCaMP3 fluorescence. However, in these BAPTA-AM-treated cells, GPN-induced increases in GCaMP3 responses were completely abolished by a pre-treatment of Bafilomycin-A (Baf-A), a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morgan et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). Given that both Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes and GFP-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators are known to be sensitive to other ionic factors, particularly pH (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rudolf et al., 2003</a>), GPN-induced changes in lysosomal and peri-lysosomal pH could directly or indirectly account for the BAPTA-insensitive GCaMP3 and residual Fura-2 signals. Consistent with this prediction, in the vacuoles isolated from HEK-GCaMP3-ML1 cells, GCaMP3 fluorescence was sensitive not only to high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but also to low pH (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). Because ratiometric dyes are less susceptible to pH changes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morgan et al., 2015</a>), in the Fura-2 assay, GPN may induce a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, but also a pH-mediated contaminating non-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (compare <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B with C</a>)."

Baf-A and Concanamycin-A (Con-A), inhibitors of the V-ATPase, increase the pH of the lysosome (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morgan et al., 2011</a>), demonstrated by abolishing LysoTracker staining within minutes after application (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

Thapsigargin (TG), a specific inhibitor of the ER SERCA pump (<a href=\"#bib55\">Thastrup et al., 1990</a>), rapidly and completely abolished Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling to lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,G</a>), but did not affect the first, na\u00efve ML-SA1 response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; second response marked with arrow) or lysosomal pH (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Recent findings have shown that as endosomes mature, they increase their contact with the ER (<a href=\"#bib16\">Friedman et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from SERCA inhibition on the ER was detected on our GCaMP3-ML1 probe (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,F</a>), likely due to close membrane contact between the ER and lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eden, 2016</a>). Similar detection of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by a genetically-encoded, lysosomally-targeted chameleon Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor utilizing lysosome membrane protein Lamp1 has also been reported (<a href=\"#bib34\">McCue et al., 2013</a>). Using time-lapse confocal imaging, we found that the majority of lysosomes, marked by Lamp1-mCherry, move and traffic together with ER tubules, labeled with CFP-ER (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a>).

Since IP3Rs are responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hayashi et al., 2009</a>), we examined whether IP3Rs on the ER were responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling of the lysosome. Notably, Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling of the non-na\u00efve lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> store was completely blocked by Xestospongin-C (Xesto; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>), a relatively specific IP3R blocker (<a href=\"#bib44\">Peppiatt et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>). In addition, in the GPN &amp; Fura-2 assay that provides a measurement of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release independent of ML1, blocking IP3 receptor by Xesto profoundly attenuated lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling in both HEK-GCaMP3-ML1 cells and non-transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013J</a>). Acute application of Xesto after allowing lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores to refill for 5 min (hence stores are completely\u00a0refilled and functionally equivalent to 'na\u00efve' ones) also slowly (up to 10\u2009min) reduced lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, suggesting that constitutive lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release under resting conditions may gradually deplete lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores if refilling is prevented (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis, long-term (20\u2009min) treatment with the aforementioned ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> manipulators including TG and TPEN almost completely abolished lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), further supporting the interpretation that ongoing constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and refilling requires ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>."

Due to their pH sensitivities, these dyes can detect intra-lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>LY</sub>) changes, but preferentially only when the intra-lysosomal pH (pH<sub>L</sub>) remains constant below pH 5.0 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morgan et al., 2015</a>) (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>).

Lysosomal dysfunction is commonly associated with a compensatory increase of lysosome biogenesis, manifested as increased expression of essential lysosomal genes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Settembre et al., 2013</a>). For example, the expression of Lamp1, a lysosomal marker, is elevated in most LSDs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Meikle et al., 1997</a>). Lamp1 expression was significantly elevated in cells treated with low concentrations of IP3R blockers 2-APB and Xesto, as well as the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator TPEN, but not in the cells treated with the RyR blocker DHBP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

Notably, in cells that were treated with Xesto, but not with the vehicle control DMSO, lysosomal compartments were enlarged, and non-degradable, autofluorescent lipofuscin-like materials accumulated in puncta structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), reminiscent of cells with defective lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (ML1 KO cells; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

IP3Rs on the ER release Ca<sup>2+</sup> to produce a local high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, from which an unknown low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport mechanism refills Ca<sup>2+</sup> to a lysosome. Unidentified tether proteins may link the ER membrane proteins directly with the lysosomal membrane proteins to maintain contact sites of 20\u201330 nm for purposes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange. Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from lysosomes or a reduction/depletion in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub> may, through unidentified mechanisms, 'promote' or 'stabilize' ER-lysosome interaction (<a href=\"#bib45\">Phillips and Voeltz, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Eden, 2016</a>). At the functional ER-lysosome contact sites, Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be transferred from the ER to lysosomes through a passive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter or channel based on the large chemical gradient of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is created when lysosome stores are depleted. Baf-A and Con-A are specific V-ATPase inhibitors; Xesto and 2APB are IP3R blockers; U73122 is a PLC inhibitor that blocks the constitutive production of IP3; DHBP and Ryanodine (&gt;10\u2009\u03bcM) are specific RyR blockers; TG and CPA are SERCA pump inhibitors; and TPEN is a luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator."

Our findings are in contrast to several studies in the literature that suggest\u00a0that inhibition of the V-ATPase is sufficient to deplete lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Previous conclusions suggesting the importance of H<sup>+</sup> gradient in regulating lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores would therefore\u00a0implicate the existence of an H<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter in lysosomal membranes that can operate at the extremely low cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> level (100 nM), representing a high affinity uptake system. Our work, however, suggest that a low affinity uptake mechanism is more likely. Hence either a low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter or rectifying Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel might suffice. A putative VDAC-like channel in the lysosome, resembling mitochondrial VDAC channels (<a href=\"#bib56\">van der Kant and Neefjes, 2014</a>), may interact directly with IP3Rs to receive Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER. Importantly, it has been previously suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into isolated lysosomes is mediated by a low-affinity (mM range) Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lemons and Thoene, 1991</a>)."

                        "text": "The\u00a0lysosomal pH gradient is thought to be essential for the maintenance of high free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calcraft et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dickson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shen et al., 2012</a>). However, in addition to triggering lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, as proposed by Christensen et al. (<a href=\"#bib8\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>), lysosomal pH elevation is also known to affect [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub> or its measurement via several other mechanisms. Whereas the total [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub> is reported to be in the low mM range (5\u201310\u2009mM), free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub> is generally agreed to be in the high \u03bcM range (100\u2013500\u2009\u03bcM) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morgan et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, the\u00a0lysosome lumen must contain substantial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morgan et al., 2015</a>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers in acidic compartments and\u00a0the ER are known to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> much better at neutral pH (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dickson et al., 2012</a>). Hence increasing pH<sub>L</sub> from 4.8 to 7.0 may effectively reduce free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub> without necessarily triggering lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and affecting total [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Ly</sub>. Consistent with such\u00a0an interpretation, a compelling study recently demonstrated that in secretory granules and the ER, increasing luminal pH changed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> containing compartments and reduced free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], while causing a minimal (20 nM) increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dickson et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, lysosomal pH may act on luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes by affecting their chromophore fluorescence and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morgan et al., 2015</a>). Because <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>\u00a0drops more than 1,000 foldtimes when pH<sub>L</sub> is increased from 4.8 to 7.0, accurate calibration is currently\u00a0not\u00a0possible.\u00a0Furthermore, prolonged lysosomal pH manipulations may also indirectly affect lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, for instance, via membrane fusion and fission between compartments containing different amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, and their buffers. Finally, although elevating lysosomal pH may trigger lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, the accompanying\u00a0increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was rather small (20\u201340 nM) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dickson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>). Moreover, the instantaneous changes (following pH increase and decrease) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe fluorescence (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dickson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>) are inconsistent with the slow rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak and re-uptake demonstrated in the current study."

GPN can certainly be used in conjunction with other tools to examine lysosome specificity, but caution is necessary with its use for Ca<sup>2+</sup> store measurement, as a component of the signal observed in Fura-2 loaded cells, although small, is a result of the membrane permeabilization that causes a decrease in cytosolic pH. Similarly, reagents like Baf-A and NAADP that are used to mobilize lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> also release H<sup>+</sup> into the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib40\">Morgan and Galione, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Appelqvist et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Scott and Gruenberg, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yoshimori et al., 1991</a>), which could have been misinterpreted as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morgan et al., 2011</a>). pH may affect cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators through the chromophore fluorescence, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity, or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent conformational changes (e.g., in the case of GCaMP) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morgan et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, if experimental conditions are not optimized, the presumed cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals may also\u00a0reflect\u00a0pH changes, or unidentified pH-mediated non-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. We propose that BAPTA-AM control experiments be routinely conducted in any lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement. It is possible that the 'pH contaminating effect' might have resulted in numerous misinterpretations of lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in the literature, particularly those examining the interactions between ER and lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup>."

First, lysosome store depletion may trigger establishment of ER-lysosome contacts (<a href=\"#bib45\">Phillips and Voeltz, 2016</a>). Although lysosomes and ER are in close proximity under resting conditions, lysosome store depletion may 'stabilize' the ER-lysosome contact, and/or 'tether' and\u00a0approximate\u00a0both membranes (e.g., from 20\u201330 nm to 10 nm) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Phillips and Voeltz, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Eden, 2016</a>).

Experiments were carried out 0.5 to 6\u2009hr after plating. Because baseline may drift during the entire course of the experiment (up to 20\u2009min), we typically set F<sub>0</sub> based on the value that is closest to the baseline."

Using various manipulations designed to inhibit the proton pump (Baf-A or Con-A) and several Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging tools that directly and indirectly monitor lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the authors show that the proton pump by is likely not responsible for refilling of the lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store. Rather the authors report that manipulations that deplete ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores also affect refilling of the lysosomal compartment, suggesting a functional and possibly physical coupling of the ER and lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. The authors include new results using OG-BAPTA-dextran showing that depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by thapsigargin, or inhibition of IP3Rs by the membrane permeable Xestospongin inhibited the lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> content. An interesting point is that the previously postulated H<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter must operate with cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> level of 100 nM and therefore be extremely high affinity. The present mechanism, although not identified, would be a low affinity uptake mechanism."

In the Christensen studies, inhibiting V-ATPase with Baf (similar to the treatment used in this paper) increased luminal pH to ~ 7.0 (where the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging dye should work well) and drastically decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]lys from ~ mM to \u03bcM. Although you added new OG-BAPTA imaging, it needs calibration. You should show the data measuring the pH and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The bar graphs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>) do not provide information about the kinetics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> change and how they may (or may not) correlate with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes reported by the GCaMP ML1 indicator shown in the majority of the data. Example traces of the lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator in response to lysosomal and ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion should be shown."

In the Christensen et al. studies, however, the pH of each lysosome was monitored and used to calibrate the <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of the dye. The Christensen studies (using lysosomes that do not overexpress any Ca-releasing channel) suggest that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]lumen faithfully follows [pH]lumen. Other studies using 45Ca uptake measurement also support the importance of pH gradient (e.g. Lemons &amp; Thoene 1991, JBC 266: 14378). However, the pH sensitivity of the indicators used in the present paper were not tested in situ. We suggest you test the pH sensitivity of your Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator in situ by placing a small mouth pipette electrode containing low pH solution+ x [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] next to tagged channel indicator and measure its sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes. Please provide more detail in the Discussion why you think the previously published measurements were erroneous."

However, in contrast to the authors' theory, this does not have a lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> defect. The authors attribute this to an unknown compensatory mechanism.

First, we monitored lysosomal pH under different conditions using Oregon green 488-dextran, a commonly- used luminal pH indicator [1, 2] (see Methods and new <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3I</a>). Using the calibration that we made for OG-488-dextran (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3I</a>), we showed that lysosomal pH (pH<sub>L</sub>), which is ~4.8 under the resting condition, increased dramatically within minutes to ~ pH 7.0 upon treatment of Baf-A1 (5 \u03bcM) or NH4Cl (10 mM) in HEK293 cells stably expressing ML1 (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3J, K</a>). Second, based on the calibration for the luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye OG-BAPTA-dextran (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), we found that the intra-lysosomal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly), which was ~ 360 \u03bcM under the resting condition, dropped quickly to ~ 100 \u03bcM upon ML-SA1 application (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H, I</a>). Note that at pH 4.5, OG-BAPTA- dextran\u2019s <i>K</i>d is ~300 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), allowing measurement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ranging from 30 (0.1 <i>K</i>d) to 3,000 (10 <i>K</i>d) \u03bcM [3]. At the resting pH<sub>L</sub> of 4.8 in the HEK cells, OG-BAPTA- dextran\u2019s working range is 130-1,300 \u03bcM (<i>K</i>d ~ 130 \u03bcM). Overall, all these values are in rough agreement with previous measurements [1, 3, 4]."

If the effect of lysosomal pH is exclusively on the <i>K</i>d of OG-BAPTA-dextran, these results would suggest that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly dropped significantly, as concluded by Christensen et al. [5]. However, in addition to triggering lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, as proposed by Christensen et al.

In most studies dealing with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the total versus free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the intracellular organelles (stores) are often not separately-considered since these two parameters are interrelated. Whereas the total [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly is reported to be in the low mM range (5-10 mM), free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly is generally agreed to be in the high \u03bcM range (100-500 \u03bcM; 360 \u03bcM in the current study) [3]. Therefore, the lysosome lumen must contain a substantial amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers [3]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers in the acidic compartments and ER are known to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> much better at neutral pH (H<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> compete with each other for Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers) [4]. Hence increasing pH<sub>L</sub> from 4.8 to 7.0 may effectively reduce free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly without necessarily triggering lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and affecting total [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly."

Because <i>K</i>d is dropped more than 1,000 times when pH<sub>L</sub> is increased from 4.8 to 7.0 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), perfect calibration is currently impossible. Note that in the Christensen studies, which were conducted in the activated macrophages, the basal pH<sub>L</sub>is ~ pH 3.8 [5]. When pH<sub>L</sub>was increased from 3.8 to 5.0, the free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly was already dropped to ~ 10 \u03bcM (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> of ref. [5]). However, in most studies including the current study, lysosomal pH is between 4.5 to 5.0 [1]. Hence, the mechanism proposed by Christensen et al., might not apply to most cell types whose basal pH<sub>L</sub>is close to pH 5.0. In addition, because of high levels of luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers, the amount of releasable Ca<sup>2+</sup> is high. Hence, a depletion of free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly to low \u03bcM is expected to produce a large cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase, which did not occur (see below). In the current study, upon ML-SA1 application to deplete the stores, free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly dropped from 360 to 100 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Hence, within physiological ranges of lysosomal pH (4.8 -7.0) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the fluorescence signals of OG-BAPTA- dextran dyes might be nearly saturated, and this would prevent accurate determinations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly changes when pH<sub>L</sub>is increased from 4.8 to 7.0 upon Baf-A1 or NH4Cl application. Note that at pH 7.0, OG-BAPTA-dextran\u2019s <i>K</i>d is ~0.1 \u03bcM (Figure\u2014figure supplement 3C), which is not suitable for measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> over 10 \u03bcM."

However, in addition to triggering lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, as proposed by Christensen et al. (Christensen et al., 2002), lysosomal pH elevation is also known to affect [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly or its measurement via several other mechanisms. Whereas the total [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly is reported to be in the low mM range (5-10 mM), free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly is generally agreed to be in the high \u03bcM range (100-500 \u03bcM) (Morgan et al., 2015). Therefore, lysosome lumen must contain substantial amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers (Morgan et al., 2015). Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers in the acidic compartments and ER are known to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> much better at neutral pH (Dickson et al., 2012). Hence increasing pH<sub>L</sub>from 4.8 to 7.0 may effectively reduce free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly without necessarily triggering lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and affecting total [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]Ly. Consistent with such interpretation, a compelling study recently demonstrated that in secretory granules and the ER, increasing luminal pH changed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> containing compartments intraluminally to reduce free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], while causing a minimal (20 nM) increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Dickson et al., 2012). Additionally, lysosomal pH may act on luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes by affecting their chromophore fluorescence and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity (<i>K</i>d) (Morgan et al., 2015).
