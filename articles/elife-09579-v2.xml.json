Methanol or formalin-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, then soaked in solutions containing the photo-tag: 4-benzoylbenzyl-glycyl-hexahistidine. Confocal imaging along with two photon excitation are used to covalently couple photo-tags to all proteins within each ROI, to a resolution of 0.67 \u00b5m in the xy-plane and 1.48 \u00b5m axially. After tissue solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. As a test case, we examined amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones. STOMP can be applied to various biological samples including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue."

Methanol or formalin-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, then soaked in solutions containing the photo-tag: 4-benzoylbenzyl-glycyl-hexahistidine. Confocal imaging along with two photon excitation are used to covalently couple photo-tags to all proteins within each ROI, to a resolution of 0.67 \u00b5m in the xy-plane and 1.48 \u00b5m axially. After tissue solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. As a test case, we examined amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones. STOMP can be applied to various biological samples including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue."

Early methods used to identify these deposits include the silver stain introduced by <a href=\"#bib8\">Golgi (1873)</a>, and Virchow's iodine\u2013sulfuric acid stain for starch (<a href=\"#bib43\">Virchow, 1854</a>) that led to the coining of the term amyloid (<a href=\"#bib44\">Virchow, 1855</a>). More specialized stains and labels have emerged which have begun to probe the structure and composition of pathological protein deposits. The stains Congo red and thioflavin S (ThS) were discovered later and remain in use (reviewed by Westermark (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sipe and Westermark, 2005</a>) and Tanskanen (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tanskanen, 2013</a>)), specifically identifying deposits containing a particular structural motif: amyloid \u03b2-pleated sheets. Beyond mere detection lies comprehensive identification of the protein components of these deposits; biochemical analyses of the deposits have produced transformative results in the field of neurodegeneration research. Two classic examples include the discovery of the prion protein and formulation of the protein-only hypothesis of prion disease (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bolton et al., 1982</a>), and the discovery of the Alzheimer amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Glenner and Wong, 1984</a>) and formulation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD, reviewed by Musiek and Holtzman (<a href=\"#bib23\">Musiek and Holtzman, 2015</a>)). More recently, there was the discovery that the RNA/DNA binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa) is a significant component of ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions in certain cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Neumann et al., 2006</a>). This discovery helped establish these diseases as spectrum disorders (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mackenzie, 2007</a>), it led to the identification of TDP-43 mutations that are causative for ALS and FTD (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sreedharan et al., 2008</a>) and established a role for RNA metabolism in ALS/FTD pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lagier-Tourenne and Cleveland, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Mackenzie et al., 2010</a>)."

Immunohistochemical methods are then used to confirm that the identified proteins are bona fide constituents of the pathological deposits. These methods require large amounts of sometimes-scarce pathological tissue and identification of novel protein components can require increasingly elaborate, time-consuming, and costly protocols. For example, the discovery of TDP-43 in ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions required the generation of \u223c1000 monoclonal antibodies, which were used to screen thousands of tissue sections by immunohistochemistry, to obtain a single monoclonal antibody that specifically labeled ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Neumann et al., 2006</a>). That antibody was used for the proteomic identification of TDP-43 from the detergent-insoluble fraction of pathological tissue homogenates, and confirmatory staining with commercial TDP-43 antibodies was required for validation. In addition to being costly and labor intensive, another major limitation of biochemical purification of protein deposits is that soluble protein components associated with the core aggregates are likely to be lost during fractionation. Identifying deposit-associated soluble proteins could further our understanding of disease mechanisms."

The resolution of LCM is \u223c10 \u00b5m in the horizontal plane and captures the entire thickness of the tissue section along the vertical axis. Thus, for features smaller than \u223c10 \u00b5m\u2014such as inclusion bodies, small amyloid plaques, narrow fibers, and other irregularly shaped structures\u2014LCM analysis permits enrichment but not complete isolation of target proteins; samples are diluted with extraneous surrounding material.

A more recent LCM study has suggested that amyloid plaques in AD are highly homogenous structures that are composed almost exclusively of A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib35\">S\u00f6derberg et al., 2006</a>). The latter study, however, employed sample washing steps with 1% SDS, which may strip away soluble plaque-associated proteins. Finally, a recent attempt to capture more plaque-associated proteins potentially lost to LCM examined the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of brain samples from patients with AD and appropriate controls (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gozal et al., 2009</a>). Altered levels of eleven specific proteins were identified by this approach but colocalization with amyloid plaques was difficult to validate in many cases\u2014not all insoluble proteins within the brain will necessarily originate from senile plaques. A recent proteomic analysis of fractions obtained from differential centrifugation procedures that yield fractions enriched in post-synaptic proteins have demonstrated that the post-synaptic protein IRSp53 was highly down-regulated in AD (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>).

Greater amounts of tissue will increase sensitivity and enable identification of lower abundance proteins, particularly in very complex samples containing a large number of unique proteins. In this study, we were able to identify proteins present in relative abundance in the pathological feature being examined using a total photo-tagged volume of approximately 2 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>. (This corresponds to a photo-tagged region of 500 \u00b5m \u00d7 500 \u00b5m in an 8-\u00b5m thick tissue section or a cube of photo-tagged tissue 130 \u03bcm on a side.) Lowering the stringency will increase the number of hits but may introduce more false positives. Two frozen sections of TgCRND8 brain tissue were sufficient to produce the necessary volume of photo-tagged tissue required for one STOMP experiment, and the process required a total of 12\u201316 hr of microscope time per sample (6\u20138 hr per section)."

As regards the quantitative nature of the data, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> collects and summarizes our high-confidence mass spectrometry protein identifications, sorted by molecular-weight-normalized spectral counts: a semi-quantitative proxy for protein abundance. As expected, the most abundant protein found in STOMP from TgCRND8 mouse plaques was A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In addition to A\u03b2, we identified 454 proteins in at least one of two biological replicates (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Combining our biological and technical replicates with our negative controls (\u2018dark\u2019 samples and replicates), we used the Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT) algorithm (<a href=\"#bib4\">Choi et al., 2011</a>), which uses Bayesian inference to assign a probability of a true interaction, using A\u03b2 as the bait protein. We found 62 proteins with probability &gt;0.8 of being found associated with the plaques, and 146 with probability &gt;0.5 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Among these, synaptosomal proteins were highly enriched, including SNAP25, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), vesicular proton pump ATPase (v-ATPase), and synapsins 1 and 2. Apolipoprotein E, which is sometimes associated with senile plaques (<a href=\"#bib41\">Thal et al., 1997</a>), was also detected, albeit at a SAINT score of 0.70 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Certain common synaptic markers\u2014including chromogranin A/C, synaptophysin, synaptogyrin I, synaptoporin, \u03b1-synuclein, and VGLUT1 and 2\u2014were not detected in the plaques. Interestingly, the plaques were also devoid of uniquely post-synaptic proteins. We also identified many mitochondrial proteins; although the reason for this is unclear, it may be that the intrinsic hydrophobicity of mitochondrial membrane proteins may predispose them to associate with amyloid plaques. Comparison with proteins found from STOMP analysis of non-plaque areas revealed only limited overlap (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>); VAMP2, synapsin 1, and dynamin 1 are present in both plaque and non-plaque STOMP analysis but are significantly greater enriched in the plaque STOMP samples."

One possibility is that damaged dystrophic neurites that are known to surround the plaques (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chishti et al., 2001</a>) are spilling their contents and the physical properties of certain pre-synaptic proteins cause them to bind with especially high affinity to amyloid plaques. In this regard, it is noteworthy that many of these proteins are membrane proteins with coiled coil domains (<a href=\"#bib39\">Takamori et al., 2006</a>). Another possibility, which is not mutually exclusive and provides an explanation for the presence of pre-synaptic proteins in plaques, is that A\u03b2 fibrils and/or oligomers bind directly to synaptic vesicles and interfere with synaptic function. Evidence for a damaging effect of A\u03b2 on synapses and dendrites has been available for some time (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mattson et al., 1998</a>). Diffusible A\u03b2 oligomers added to cultured primary neurons have been shown to associate with synaptosomes and a concomitant synaptic deterioration is observed (<a href=\"#bib13\">Lacor et al., 2007</a>). In post-mortem AD tissue and in transgenic AD mice, an inverse correlation between levels of A\u03b2 oligomers and levels of synaptic proteins was noted (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pham et al., 2010</a>). The reduction in the levels of detectable synaptic protein in AD tissue may be the result of the aggregation and entrapment of the synaptic proteins in the amyloid plaques. In sum, the STOMP technique has provided clear evidence of interaction of amyloid plaques with pre-synaptic proteins."

Human tissue is inherently more difficult to work with than animal tissue because of biochemical changes associated with post-mortem degradation. Furthermore, formalin, the fixative of choice for human tissue, causes covalent modification of proteins and confounds mass spectrometry analysis. These limitations notwithstanding, we find the STOMP technique is suitable for the analysis of formalin-fixed post-mortem human tissue. Senile plaques from brain sections of a severe case of AD were visualized with ThS and photo-tagged using a procedure identical to that used for the TgCRND8 tissue. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein composition of these senile plaques identified 60 proteins that were statistically significantly enriched, with A\u03b2 being the most abundant protein component (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Synaptic proteins and proteins involved in synaptic vesicle transport comprised 15% of the abundant protein component of the plaques. For validation of the STOMP analysis of senile plaques, immunofluorescence staining was employed, revealing that GFAP and SNAP25 were detected by both immunofluorescence, while tau and \u03b1-synuclein were not detected by either technique (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

Glial proteins, GFAP and excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson and Swanson, 2000</a>), were both detected in (human) senile plaques (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>); however, only EAAT was detected in TgCRND8 amyloid plaques (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This apparent discrepancy is likely due to astrocytes being more intimately associated with amyloid plaques in human tissue (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,E,I</a>) compared to plaques in the TgCRND mouse (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,J,P</a>). Tau protein was also not among the abundant plaque proteins. Immunofluorescence staining shows that tau, which is contained in dystrophic neurites that surround the plaques, do not occupy the same physical space as the plaques and were hence not detected in the STOMP analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,H,N</a>). SNAP25, on the other hand, was detected in the STOMP analysis and was seen to colocalize with senile plaques (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,H,L</a>) and amyloid plaques from TgCRND8 mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,I,O</a>). \u03b1-synuclein is part of the NAC (non-amyloid components) of plaques\u2014with a possible role in fibril formation but not part of the plaque core (<a href=\"#bib5\">Culvenor et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wirths and Bayer, 2003</a>).

Senile plaques in the human AD tissue were positive for both SNAP25 and VAMP2. However, synaptophysin staining, which was absent in the amyloid deposits of AD mice, displayed a unique punctate lobular profile that decorated the periphery of the plaque in the human tissue (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

The procedure does not require large quantities of tissue and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. Using amyloid plaques in TgCRND8 mice as a test subject, we demonstrated that STOMP is capable of determining the protein composition of pathological deposits in neurodegenerative disease. Our discovery that there is an accumulation of certain pre-synaptic proteins in AD plaques and in TgCRND8 mice provides direct evidence for an association between amyloid plaque formation and synaptic function. While our initial work in characterizing amyloid deposits in mouse brain used methanol fixed tissues to minimize problems with solubilizing tissue, our experience with human AD pathological tissue shows that STOMP of formalin-fixed archival tissue is possible. The STOMP technique is ideally suited for determination of the compositions of intracellular protein inclusions seen in ALS and FTD. While the principle components of these inclusions, such as TDP-43<sup>9</sup>, FUS (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kwiatkowski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vance et al., 2009</a>), and dipeptide repeat proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mori et al., 2013</a>) are known, determination of the secondary components of the inclusions could shed light on disease etiology."

In this regard, the STOMP technique can easily be modified to identify the RNA composition of biological features. RNA-containing subcellular structures such as P-bodies and stress granules have been implicated in neurodegenerative disease (<a href=\"#bib16\">Li et al., 2013</a>); these structures are of suitable size for STOMP, and there is a realistic possibility of determining jointly their proteomic and transcriptomic composition with this technique. The application of this technique to many other aspects of cell biology research is also conceivable."

The concept is very simple and at the same time very clever. Regions of interest in a biological specimen prepared for imaging are selected on the basis of the distribution of a suitable marker labelled with an antibody or fluorescent protein, and then a tag (in this case hexahistidine) is photo-crosslinked to the proteins distributed in this area using a multiphoton microscope. Upon solubilisation of the fixed sample on the slide, tagged proteins are purified using a nickel matrix and identified by mass spec. This is an ingenious alternative to labelling approaches such as BioID and Apex, with the important advantage that STOMP does not require expression of recombinant proteins in the cell of interest. In addition, the authors demonstrated that STOMP can be used in formalin-fixed tissue, a feature which great expand its application potential."

In principle a (1 micrometer) 3 volume can be imaged, but often a greater volume is needed to detect protein components with confidence. Nonetheless a much smaller volume is used herein that in laser dissection capture mass spectrometry-currently being used by the Mayo Clinic commercially to identify the amyloid composing the fibrils in systemic amyloidoises."

Two-photon microscopy is then used to photoexcite the benzophenone in a 1 micron3 (10,000 \u00c5)3 volume as a minimal volume. Nickle affinity chromatography is then used to isolate the modified proteins. There are established endogenous proteins that bind to Nickle affinity chromatography resin supports, thus the permeabilized tissue sample is pretreated with diethylpyrocarbonate to destroy the binding of these proteins to the affinity resin via His modification before photoconjugation. The tagged proteins are dissolved in 2% SDS, 8M urea and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, separated by gel electrophoresis and using a parallel sample identified by LC-MS/MS."

Our discussion about 6HisBP being similar size to Congo Red was simply to illustrate the fact that, unlike a large molecule such as an antibody, 6HisBP can freely diffuse into fixed tissues.
