A paradigmatic system for studying this is the mammalian visual cortex. Maps of orientation preference (OP) and ocular dominance (OD) in the primary visual cortex of ferrets, cats and monkeys can be individually changed by altered visual input. However, the spatial relationship between OP and OD maps has appeared immutable. Using a computational model we predicted that biasing the visual input to orthogonal orientation in the two eyes should cause a shift of OP pinwheels towards the border of OD columns. We then confirmed this prediction by rearing cats wearing orthogonally oriented cylindrical lenses over each eye. Thus, the spatial relationship between OP and OD maps can be modified by visual experience, revealing a previously unknown degree of brain plasticity in response to sensory input."

A paradigmatic system for studying this is the mammalian visual cortex. Maps of orientation preference (OP) and ocular dominance (OD) in the primary visual cortex of ferrets, cats and monkeys can be individually changed by altered visual input. However, the spatial relationship between OP and OD maps has appeared immutable. Using a computational model we predicted that biasing the visual input to orthogonal orientation in the two eyes should cause a shift of OP pinwheels towards the border of OD columns. We then confirmed this prediction by rearing cats wearing orthogonally oriented cylindrical lenses over each eye. Thus, the spatial relationship between OP and OD maps can be modified by visual experience, revealing a previously unknown degree of brain plasticity in response to sensory input."

Specifically, it would change the relative positions of the pinwheels and eye-specific columns within the visual parts of the brain. This prediction turned out to be correct. Young cats that wore special lenses \u2013 which slightly distorted what they saw but did not obviously affect their behavior \u2013 showed the predicted changes in brain structure."

These feature preferences are arranged spatially in the form of OP and OD maps, with stereotypical structure within each map, and strong spatial relationships between them (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blasdel and Salama, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bonhoeffer and Grinvald, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartfeld and Grinvald, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Obermayer and Blasdel, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">H\u00fcbener et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nauhaus et al., 2012</a>). While some aspects of the structure of OD and OP maps individually are plastic in response to altered visual input, such as monocular deprivation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hubel et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shatz and Stryker, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Farley et al., 2007</a>) or stripe rearing (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sengpiel et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tanaka et al., 2006</a>), none of these manipulations has succeeded in modifying the overall spatial relationships between OD and OP maps, which have appeared immune from environmental influence. In particular OP map pinwheels, where domains representing all orientations meet at a point, always tend to lie close to the center of OD regions. This is true even after manipulations of the visual input such as rearing animals with artificially induced strabismus (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">L\u00f6wel, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">L\u00f6wel et al., 1998</a>) or monocular deprivation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Crair et al., 1997</a>). However, whether this relationship is a fundamental aspect of map structure that is determined by innate mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib22\">Godecke and Bonhoeffer, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Crair et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kaschube et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Katz and Crowley, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tomita et al., 2013</a>), and thus beyond the limits of brain plasticity, is unclear."

However, such models also suggest that the spatial relationship between pinwheels and OD regions might be sensitive to visual experience (<a href=\"#bib20\">Giacomantonio et al., 2010</a>). Here we used a computational model to predict how rearing animals with visual input biased to vertical orientations in one eye and horizontal orientations in the other eye (cross-rearing) would change these relationships. We then confirmed this prediction by raising cats with weak (-10 dioptre) cylindrical lenses placed in front of their eyes throughout the critical period. This demonstrates a form of plasticity in the relationships between visual feature maps that has not previously been observed."

As the strength of over-representation (\u03b1) increased, the histograms became increasingly biased away from the center of OD regions, indicating a shift in the relative location of pinwheels towards the OD borders (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). To determine whether this is due to the movement of pinwheels, OD borders, or both, we then fixed the random seed in the algorithm and explored how the spatial relationships changed within reproducible maps as a function of \u03b1. An example is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a>, from which it is clear that both pinwheel positions and OD borders move in the cross-reared case. The average distance that pinwheels move from their original (\u03b1 = 1) positions as a function of \u03b1 is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h</a>. Thus, in the model, cross-rearing alters the spatial relationship between pinwheels and OD borders by causing movement of both."

The lens covering the left eye had its axis aligned vertically, so that the left eye was exposed to high contrast contours with primarily horizontal orientation. Conversely, the lens covering the right eye had its axis aligned horizontally, so that the right eye was exposed to high contrast contours with primarily vertical orientation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The lens strength was chosen based on preliminary observations that animals wearing -10 dioptre lenses exhibited normal behavioural activity, while animals with higher power lenses (e.g., as used in <a href=\"#bib53\">Tanaka et al. [2006]</a>) were noticeably less active. Animals wore the masks for 6\u2009hr per day while the room was illuminated and were otherwise kept in darkness. During light periods the animals were monitored at least every 30 min to ensure the masks remained in place and to encourage active visual behaviours, such as chasing light patterns and balls. Paw striking behaviour towards objects in front of the animals appeared normal. From age 20 weeks we used intrinsic signal optical imaging followed by extracellular single unit recordings to map OP and OD preferences in cortical areas 17 and 18 of 5 cross-reared animals (10 hemispheres), and 6 normally reared control animals (11 hemispheres)."

Conventional techniques for map generation from intrinsic signal imaging data are based on the calculation of difference images by either subtraction or division by a reference image that is independent of the stimulus of interest. We found that these techniques left strong blood vessel artifacts in the maps derived from green light data, particularly for ocular dominance maps. However we were able to overcome this problem by using extended spatial decorrelation (ESD), a more sophisticated analysis technique (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stetter et al., 2000</a>) (see Materials and methods). This technique robustly separated the noise and mapping signals even in the green light data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b\u2013d</a>). Consistent with a brief earlier report (<a href=\"#bib19\">Frostig et al., 1990</a>), by imaging one of our control animals with both green (520 nm) and red (609 nm) wavelengths we found that the maps produced were very similar (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e\u2013h</a>). We also compared measures of orientation preference from the OP maps with corresponding measures obtained from single unit recordings from the superficial layers of the cortex at each electrode track location. Where we obtained robust estimates from both the imaging and unit recordings we found a high level of correlation between the two measures (<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.64, p=0.003) with a median absolute difference of 15.2\u00b0."

Cross-rearing caused a very slight reduction in orientation selectivity, as derived from the OP maps (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although the selectivity\u00a0distributions appear very similar, the difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001, two-sample Kruskal-Wallis test). However cross-rearing induced profound changes in map structure. In control animals there was an over-representation of cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations in the OP map. This is consistent with the distribution of orientation preferences of single units described above, and with previous reports for ferrets (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coppola et al., 1998</a>) and cats (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2003</a>).

There was no statistically significant change in pinwheel density (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kaschube et al., 2010</a>) between rearing conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). The distribution of intersection angles between OD and OP maps was also similar in both rearing conditions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). There were subtle changes in the spatial distribution of orientation selectivity: in control animals orientation selectivity was slightly greater near OD borders, while in cross-reared animals selectivity was slightly greater near the centre of OD regions (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However there was a clear effect on the distance of pinwheels to OD borders. In our control animals, the distribution of pinwheels relative to OD borders was very similar to that of <a href=\"#bib30\">H\u00fcbener et al. (1997)</a> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>) but in cross-reared animals there was a significant shift of pinwheels away from the centre of OD regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). Specifically, there was a significant under representation of pinwheels in the bin corresponding to the centre of OD columns (p=0.01, two-tailed t-test, power = 0.77, 95% confidence interval for difference in means = [0.06, 0.36]), as predicted in our model simulations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). Thus, the altered visual input during cross-rearing changed a fundamental aspect of the spatial relationship between OP and OD maps. The similarity between the model prediction and our data provides further evidence that models based on dimension reduction, such as the elastic net, capture essential elements of the mechanisms by which cortical maps develop."

We found consistent changes in cortical response properties from both our electrophysiology and optical imaging. Our findings agree with previous cell population surveys and imaging experiments on cats raised in environments with a single orientation (stripe-rearing) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blakemore and Cooper, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sengpiel et al., 1999</a>) or with orthogonal orientations presented to the left and right eye (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hirsch and Spinelli, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blakemore, 1976</a>). These studies, like our own, revealed an over-representation of single units tuned to the orientation that matches the rearing conditions. Interestingly, we found no significant difference in \u0394OP \u2013 the inter-ocular difference in preferred orientation \u2013 of units from our control and cross-reared animals. This might seem surprising given the mismatched inputs in the cross-reared animals. However, previous work using much stronger orientation biases found that cells tend to become monocular rather than maintain large \u0394OP values (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hirsch and Spinelli, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blakemore, 1976</a>). Consistent with these earlier reports, we observed an increase in the monocularity of units from our cross-reared animals compared to the controls (median monocularity index, <i>MI,</i> of 0.38 versus 0.24 for the cross-reared and control animals, respectively). However, only about 10% of single units in our cross-reared animals were monocular, suggesting that relatively normal binocular summation developed in these animals. This is consistent with the relatively low power lenses that we used during rearing (-10 dioptres), compared to the higher power lenses used by others (67 dioptres, cats, <a href=\"#bib53\">Tanaka et al. (2006)</a>; 167 dioptres, mice, <a href=\"#bib34\">Kreile et al. (2011)</a>). Evidently, cortical neurons in our cross-reared animals retained access to a sufficiently broad range of orientations to form fused binocular images during development. Similarly, units from our cross-reared animals generated similar maximum spike rates and had indistinguishable contrast sensitivity to the control animals, again suggesting that the lenses had little impact on basic visual processing."

In adult cats, chronic imaging of OP maps in response to spatially synchronous cortical activity induced by intracortical electrical microstimulation has shown substantial rearrangement of pinwheel positions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Godde et al., 2002</a>).

The representation of other orientations then forms around this initial configuration, and thus pinwheels are pushed away from the centre of the OD regions, which are dominated by the over-represented orientations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c\u2013f</a>). In the model, movement of both pinwheels and OD borders contribute to the change in their spatial relationship; however we cannot directly assess whether this is also true in our experimental data."

This was motivated by our preliminary observations that weak lenses were required to avoid obvious behavioural changes in the kittens. The relatively low power of the lenses in our experiment suggests sensitivity of visual cortical structure to relatively small variations in sensory input. This raises the intriguing possibility that a component of the large variability in visual map structure between individuals, seen in cats (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kaschube et al., 2002</a>) and humans (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2007</a>), could be partly due to individual variations in visual experience (astigmatism, the closest analogy to rearing with cylindrical lenses in humans, has been reported with powers of up to 6 dioptres [<a href=\"#bib38\">Mitchell et al., 1973</a>]). More generally, our results redefine the limits of cortical plasticity, and emphasize the importance of appropriate patterns of sensory stimulation during critical periods for normal brain development."

The first image in the dataset was arbitrarily chosen as the reference frame, and every other image was translated to maximise the linear correlation between it and the reference frame. Trials from opposite directions of stimulus motion were pooled, and then all trials for each stimulus condition for each dataset were pixel-wise averaged, resulting in 50 imaging frames for each of 8 stimulus orientations (0\u00b0, 22.5\u00b0, \u2026, 157.5\u00b0), for both eyes.

Image frames were zero-padded prior to filtering. This had no effect on the map regions subsequently analysed since they were sufficiently far from the edges of the frames.

The frames of each map were first decorrelated from each other using principal component analysis (i.e., each frame\u2019s variance was made equal to 1 and the covariance, between frames, was made equal to 0). Single-shift ESD was then performed on each map using a shift of \u0394r = (5,5) pixels, resulting in 50 sources. The particular shift chosen had no appreciable difference on the resulting maps. The time series of the coefficients of each source were used to choose which of the 50 sources corresponded to the feature map in each case. The source chosen was the one with the coefficient time series that most closely matched that of the typical intrinsic signal optical imaging response (i.e., a rise at the time of stimulus onset, up to a maximal value by the time the stimulus was turned off). The correct source was obvious in most cases (for an example see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4b\u2013d</a>). In some cases, the correct source was chosen by looking at which source had both a response with the same spatial extent as the corresponding OP map and an appropriate coefficient time series. Each frame of the chosen source was then multiplied by its corresponding coefficient, and the feature map was defined as the average over frames 31 to 35 (i.e., the final 5 stimulus frames). Finally, each map was low-pass Gaussian filtered (\u03c3 = 12 pixels = 288\u2009\u03bcm). These filter parameters were chosen to remove any remaining high-frequency noise (due to remaining blood vessel artifacts) while minimising spatial distortion of the resulting feature maps."

These bins were used to generate a histogram, which we refer to as the orientation distribution.

The period was set to 90\u00b0 for control maps, and 180\u00b0 for cross-reared maps, matching the clear and expected periodicity of the data. Fits to the cross-reared maps of sine curves with period 90\u00b0 were also performed for comparison. The estimated value of the phase of the sine curve was then used to determine the location of the maxima.

The bins corresponding to both the positive and negative sections were pooled, leaving 5 bins corresponding to values from the centre to the border of the OD columns. Thus, the centre of the OD column falls into the bin below the 20<sup>th</sup> percentile and the border region into the bin above the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile.

Notably, the pinwheels are less concentrated in the centers of the ocular dominance stripes than they are in normal control animals. This result is most clearly documented in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>. The experimental findings are novel and it is also of interest that it is predicted by dimension-reduction models of visual cortex development, notably in prior work by Giacomantonio et al. (2010). Overall the paper adds an interesting new finding to the literature on cortical map plasticity; it also adds usefully to the literature on stripe-rearing experiments in cats which is not extensive, though it has a long and somewhat controversial history."

The positions of the black dots do not seem to correspond at all to the pinwheel locations in panels a), c) or e). There are pinwheels without black dots, and vice versa. I would assume this is a mistake made in preparing the figure. However, in panel e) it is visually very obvious that the pinwheel positions are almost always very close to an OD border. This seems at odds with the histogram in panel f) which shows a rather weak tendency for them to be about halfway between the OD centers and the edges. I might be wrong about this, but it does make me worry that something more serious has gone wrong with the analysis."

However, the results are generally presented as suggesting that it is the pinwheels that move (e.g. Discussion, second paragraph). The authors might try to come up with evidence that pinwheel statistics are different in the cross-reared animals, or some other kind of evidence that might point specifically to pinwheel movement. In the absence of it, I think the paper should be careful to be clear about the ambiguity: it is a slightly less interesting result if it is mainly due to OD border movement. It is also relevant because cross-orientation rearing was thought by Hubel and Wiesel and others to cause selective monocular deprivation rather than to modify orientation preference per se. Arguments against that view might usefully be made in the paper. I presume that the model really does show a shift of pinwheel positions \u2013 that might be made clear, if so."

In particular, we fixed the random seed in the algorithm so that the same map was reproducible, and then gradually increased the strength of over-representation induced by cross-rearing (\u03b1) across different simulations. This allowed us to track the positions of both pinwheels and OD borders as a function of \u03b1. An example is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>: as \u03b1 is increased both the pinwheel and the nearest OD border move, but the distance between them is reduced. The average movement of pinwheels away from their initial (\u03b1 = 1) positions in the map as a function of \u03b1 is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>. We return to these results in the Discussion: `\u2026 In the model, movement of both pinwheels and OD borders contribute to the change in their spatial relationship; however we cannot directly assess whether this is also true in our experimental data.\u2019."
