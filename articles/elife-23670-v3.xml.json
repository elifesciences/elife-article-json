The majority seem healthy, but a higher frequency of defects has been reported among ART-conceived infants, suggesting an epigenetic cost. We report the first whole-genome DNA methylation datasets from single pig blastocysts showing differences between in vivo and in vitro produced embryos. Blastocysts were produced in vitro either without (C-IVF) or in the presence of natural reproductive fluids (Natur-IVF). Natur-IVF embryos were of higher quality than C-IVF in terms of cell number and hatching ability. RNA-Seq and DNA methylation analyses showed that Natur-IVF embryos have expression and methylation patterns closer to in vivo blastocysts. Genes involved in reprogramming, imprinting and development were affected by culture, with fewer aberrations in Natur-IVF embryos. Methylation analysis detected methylated changes in C-IVF, but not in Natur-IVF, at genes whose methylation could be critical, such as IGF2R and NNAT."

The majority seem healthy, but a higher frequency of defects has been reported among ART-conceived infants, suggesting an epigenetic cost. We report the first whole-genome DNA methylation datasets from single pig blastocysts showing differences between in vivo and in vitro produced embryos. Blastocysts were produced in vitro either without (C-IVF) or in the presence of natural reproductive fluids (Natur-IVF). Natur-IVF embryos were of higher quality than C-IVF in terms of cell number and hatching ability. RNA-Seq and DNA methylation analyses showed that Natur-IVF embryos have expression and methylation patterns closer to in vivo blastocysts. Genes involved in reprogramming, imprinting and development were affected by culture, with fewer aberrations in Natur-IVF embryos. Methylation analysis detected methylated changes in C-IVF, but not in Natur-IVF, at genes whose methylation could be critical, such as IGF2R and NNAT."

Only a few are trying to discern whether in vitro fertilization\u00a0(IVF) leaves a subtle legacy in children. What will happen to these kids when they are middle-aged?\u201d\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Servick, 2014</a>). In humans, according to a study by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 190 countries, infertility affects 20% of couples and it was estimated that at least 40.5 million women were seeking infertility medical care in 2007 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mascarenhas et al., 2012</a>). ARTs provide a helpful alternative for a high proportion of infertility cases and the number of children born to date using these methods exceeds 5 million (<a href=\"#bib24\">International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology I, 2012</a>). Although the majority of them seem healthy, studies have reported higher rates of preterm births (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rubens et al., 2014</a>), non-chromosomal birth defects and adverse perinatal effects in ART pregnancies (<a href=\"#bib14\">El Hajj and Haaf, 2013</a>), with long-term effects being under study in humans\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Kissin et al., 2014</a>). Epidemiological data suggest that perturbed epigenetic gene regulation by the application of ART could be a contributory factor in these adverse outcomes (<a href=\"#bib14\">El Hajj and Haaf, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Whitelaw et al., 2014</a>), although such alterations could also be considered as consequences of parental characteristics, gamete quality or other non-epigenetic technique-derived effects (<a href=\"#bib48\">Simpson, 2014</a>). To clarify the impact of each of these factors, the use of an animal model that avoids, as much as possible, the effect of parental circumstances and the use of protocols minimizing the technique-derived effects would help to attain the goal of offering safer ART for patients."

Importantly, this last trait could be useful to remove the paternal factor (low-quality male gametes) from studies as a possible reason for any epigenetic alterations found. However, most protocols for processing boar spermatozoa for IVF include their selection by density gradient centrifugations and just a few used the swim-up procedure to isolate highly motile spermatozoa which is the routine selection in human infertility clinics. Since it was observed that spermatozoa selected by swim-up show higher rates of normal morphology and motility, and decreased DNA fragmentation and methylation levels (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2015</a>), it would be necessary to adapt the sperm selection protocols in pig before using them to model ART-derived epigenetic alterations."

Several imprinting disorders and abnormal phenotypes have been linked to ART, but of special significance is the relationship between the presence of serum in culture media and the incidence of Large Offspring syndrome (LOS) in ruminants (<a href=\"#bib56\">Young et al., 1998</a>), which includes diverse pathologic alterations and shows phenotypic and epigenetic similarities with the imprinted disorder Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) in humans (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Since it was proposed that serum in the culture medium could be a crucial factor in LOS incidence, the tendency in the procedures for both human and livestock was to move toward the use of chemically defined media, limiting the presence of proteins in the culture medium to serum albumin. Although practical, this approach may have unpredictable consequences, because it ignores the fact that the reproductive fluids have a different composition to serum and are extremely rich in proteins other than serum albumin (more than 150 have been described in the oviductal fluid [<a href=\"#bib3\">Avil\u00e9s et al., 2010</a>]). If these proteins are physiologically present, they must play a variety of roles supporting the normal development of the embryo, roles that serum albumin alone cannot properly provide and serum cannot fully mimic. In addition, although ART in species such as cattle and sheep usually results in foetal overgrowth (<a href=\"#bib55\">Young et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2015</a>), opposing phenotypes such as low birth weights (excluding BWS) are often seen in humans (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schieve et al., 2002</a>) and pigs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Garc\u00eda-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2010</a>). A study showing the relationship between child birth weight and the protein source in embryo culture media (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>) reinforces the hypothesis that the protein composition of the culture media plays a role in the correct regulation of epigenetic marks in the growing embryo. A similar conclusion can be reached from a clinical trial showing that protein enrichment of media compared with addition of serum albumin alone improved the blastocyst implantation rate and may increase human births by more than 8% (<a href=\"#bib36\">Meintjes et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, as with breast milk, which is so complex and so rich in bioactive factors that cannot be easily replaced with any artificial composition (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hennet and Borsig, 2016</a>), the idea that reproductive secretions could be necessary in the culture media should not be underrated. At least, it should be explored under experimental conditions to unveil the relevance of these secretions."

Here, the transcriptomes from three individual day 7.5 blastocysts produced by C-IVF or Natur-IVF were compared with their in vivo counterparts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). RNA libraries showed acceptable quality in all nine blastocysts. Mean number of raw reads was 14.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.23 (\u00b1SD) millions, and transcripts from 13,309 to 14,512 different genes (from a total of 20,789 annotated pig mRNAs) were detected in each individual. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that, despite expected individual variability, the three embryos from each group clustered together (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), with the C-IVF embryos showing higher variability, which could represent high embryo plasticity in response to suboptimal culture conditions. Therefore, after combining the triplicates, data from both in vitro groups showed high correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient [r]\u00a0=\u00a00.964), but Natur-IVF was closer to the In\u00a0vivo group ([r]\u00a0=\u00a00.95) than C-IVF ([r]\u00a0=\u00a00.938).

In contrast, two pathways were identified in down-regulated DEGs in C-IVF embryos, but not in Natur-IVF DEGs (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file\u00a01</a>). Increased pathways in Natur-IVF and C-IVF included cholesterol, mevalonate, serine and glycine biosynthesis and p53 signaling. Decreased pathways (protein ubiquitination and 14-3-3 mediated signaling) were detected only in C-IVF. Similarly, Physiological Systems and Functions over-represented by up-regulated or down-regulated DEGs were different between C-IVF or Natur-IVF.

Three blastocysts from each group were analyzed. The number of unique alignments in the samples ranged from 13,150,508 to 42,208,651 and the coverage of CpGs (\u22651 read) from 52% to 59.2%. The global methylation percentages of CpGs were 15.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3, 11.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 and 12.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6 for the C-IVF, Natur-IVF and In-vivo groups, respectively. The distribution of methylation levels in windows of 150 CpGs across the genome and a general view of the methylation profiles of the nine individual blastocysts are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>. The generally low level of methylation suggests that the genome has experienced substantial loss of methylation from the gametes, analogous to that observed in other mammals (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kobayashi et al., 2012</a>). The landscape of methylated cytosines suggests some structure across the genome, with regions with more methylation consistent between the individual blastocysts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). What contributes to this structure, for\u00a0example, the regions of relatively higher methylation, is not immediately obvious, as methylation was similar in different genomic contexts with no marked enrichment in repetitive elements, for example (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Regarding the different classes of blastocysts, methylation over specific genomic features followed the same tendency as the global differences, with higher values for C-IVF (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>)."

For this reason, and to obtain an unbiased measure of differences in genome methylation, a fixed size of 150 CpGs was used for analysis, as this was found to give a modal tile size of around 3 kb with about 150 reads per tile for most individuals. To make the data comparable to enable the detection of DMRs, separately from the global changes, the tiles informative in all samples (258,885) were extracted and quantile normalized. To identify DMRs, the comparison was filtered to require a consistent\u00a0\u22655% absolute methylation change between all replicates of the first and second condition, followed by a T-test (B-H adjusted p&lt;0.05). Differences between the groups were observed with fewer than 4000 DMRs for each pair-wise comparison (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>).

Therefore, they represent sites of methylation in preimplantation of clear biological significance. To identify putative igDMRs in the pig genome, all mouse igDMRs were lifted-over onto the pig genome. Where this was not possible, a gene-by-gene approach was taken to find the best possible fit for a candidate igDMR based on the known organization of the corresponding mouse imprinted gene. All the genomic regions were then inspected manually to confirm that the correct regions had been found (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4A</a>). It is not possible to conclude that all regions were actually igDMRs (as this would require methylation information from oocyte and sperm) and, indeed, the methylation values indicated that for some of the genes there was no conserved DMR (i.e. methylation in blastocysts was far below the theoretical 50%) and the associated locus was unlikely to be imprinted. This would seem to be the case, for example, for the genes <i>IMPACT</i>, <i>ZFP787</i> and <i>ZFP777</i>. For some, there was difficulty in finding possible homologous igDMRs, probably because of gaps in the porcine genome assembly (such as <i>SNRPN</i>, <i>KCNQ1</i> and <i>GRB10</i>), and there were a number of others that were excluded because the homologous pig region had no suggestion of a CpG island in the region equivalent to the igDMR in mouse (e.g. <i>U2AF1-RS1, MCTS2/H13</i>). Comparison of methylation in the three groups of blastocysts for the resulting 14 candidate igDMRs (with sufficient read coverage) revealed differences for <i>ZAC1</i> and <i>PEG10</i>, which were more methylated (p&lt;0.05) in the C-IVF than in In\u00a0vivo group, and <i>PEG10</i> and <i>NNAT</i>, which were more methylated (p&lt;0.05) in the C-IVF than in Natur-IVF and In\u00a0vivo groups (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4B</a>). No statistical differences were found between Natur-IVF and In\u00a0vivo groups. Of these three igDMRs, the one at <i>NNAT</i> coincides with the promoter CpG island (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kobayashi et al., 2012</a>) and, in addition, one 150 CpG tile overlapping NNAT had methylation higher than 50% in C-IVF in the unbiased analysis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

However, the progress made by ART during the past two decades make a future without their use inconceivable, thus it is necessary i) to characterize the real epigenetic cost of ART, separated from other factors and ii) to develop new protocols to safeguard against possible negative impacts in offspring. Our study evaluated, by single blastocyst profiling, the genetic and epigenetic impacts of modified protocols to produce embryos in vitro that mimic, as far as possible, the physiological conditions of fertilization and early embryo development. This imitation of the natural environment was first approached in both gametes separately: in the male gamete, by using sperm selection procedures that avoided centrifugations, and sperm washing and processing media containing oviductal fluid from the pre-ovulatory phase of the cycle; and, in the female gamete, by preincubating the oocytes within the precise fluid they encounter when, after ovulation, they are transported through the ampulla of the oviduct to the fertilization site, at the ampullar-isthmic junction (<a href=\"#bib22\">Halbert et al., 1988</a>). Secondly, two experimental groups were established for a comparison with the in vivo specimens, where either BSA or reproductive fluids (obtained sequentially at the corresponding phases of the cycle) were added at every step of the IVF and EC procedures."

The approach used, with spermatozoa coming from boars selected by their excellent reproductive performance, avoids the possibility of aberrations due to a paternal factor, which cannot be avoided in the human model, and helps to elucidate the epigenetic cost of ART independently of any paternal pathology. The figure of\u00a0&gt;40% progression of the cleaved embryos to blastocysts in vitro means an improvement over the best previous results (<a href=\"#bib42\">Redel et al., 2016</a>). Nonetheless, the most remarkable findings were that Natur-IVF blastocysts attained a more advanced developmental stage and that the mean number of cells per blastocyst was the same as In-vivo embryos and 61% higher than C-IVF ones, which it is also above some of the best data previously reported in pigs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Redel et al., 2016</a>). These results indicate that the use of reproductive fluids as additives, even at the low dose used in this study (1%) is beneficial for in vitro development of pig embryos so that it is now possible to obtain similar or even higher yields in the pig (45%) than in the bovine species. Although the possibility of transferring these methods to the human clinic might seem far off, the fact that nowadays other natural fluids such as breast milk for baby feeding or blood serum for transfusions are collected and stored at biobanks, make it possible to predict the future availability of human reproductive fluids obtained from oocyte donors during interventions at human infertility clinics (<a href=\"#bib12\">Coy and Yanagimachi, 2015</a>). In fact, the first samples of these fluids are already stored at Biobanc-Mur in Spain (National Register of Biobanks N\u00b0 B.0000859)."

Amongst the most striking differences found was the expression of genes related to epigenetic reprogramming. It has been shown in mice and human that during the transition from zygote to blastocyst there is a massive loss of DNA methylation, with the exception of imprinted genes and some repetitive elements (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Reik and Kelsey, 2014</a>). In agreement with this observation, the global methylation level in the three groups of pig blastocysts analyzed was below 15%, suggesting that they had largely undergone a reprogramming event. This globally low methylation level compared to somatic cells or gametes, made it difficult to find high quantitative differences between embryos. Despite this, methylation percentage was higher in C-IVF embryos than in the other two groups, in agreement with previous studies indicating that ART-derived blastocysts displayed higher levels of methylation than in vivo derived ones (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deshmukh et al., 2011</a>). This difference appeared to be global, with all features affected and, no evidence of multiple sub-groups over different genomic regions; therefore, there was no indication of specific regions resisting reprogramming. At the same time, genes for DNMT1 and the binding protein of its crucial cofactor UHRF1, which are considered responsible for maintenance of methylation patterns in replicating DNA and for maintaining imprints during preimplantation embryonic stages, were less expressed in C-IVF blastocysts, as was <i>DNMT3B</i>, required for de novo remethylation from this stage onwards. Differences in cell numbers, as a result of a probable additional round of cell division in In\u00a0vivo and Natur-IVF embryos compared to C-IVF, is unlikely to explain a shift from\u00a0~11\u201312% to\u00a0~15% global methylation. All together, these data suggest an impaired demethylation in the C-IVF group. Analysis of hemimethylated CpG dyads by deep hairpin bisulfite sequencing, as recently reported in mouse (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arand et al., 2015</a>), could help to clarify this issue."

Furthermore, there were differences in the global mean methylation levels between different samples, ranging from 8.9% to 18.5%. Taken together, these observations suggest that the samples were collected during a time of global methylation reprogramming. The variability in global methylation levels would have confounded a direct comparison focussing on locus-specific methylation differences, so to account for this a quantile normalization was required to allow for a direct quantitative comparison of methylation levels."

Despite this, we were able to find candidate DMRs between the groups with a reasonable statistical significance, although the magnitude of the methylation differences was low. Considering that previous studies have shown extremely close correlations between qPCR and RNA-seq data (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Griffith et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wu et al., 2014</a>) and that validation by qPCR has its own probe-bias based on what region of the cDNA is amplified, we deem, in contrast to microarrays data, that there is not solid evidence that validation of the RNA-Seq and DNA methylation results by qPCR will provide extra significance to our results. For this reason, we did not perform qPCR validation in this study."

Plasticity of the preimplantation embryo could enable a recovery of alterations in methylation and further expression of non-imprinted genes during development, but any erosion of methylation marks at imprinted genes are unlikely to be corrected. In our data, from the 10 candidate imprinted regions retaining more than 30% of methylation in the pig blastocysts, we found three in C-IVF (<i>ZAC1</i>, <i>PEG10</i> and <i>NNAT</i>) with significantly different methylation compared to In\u00a0vivo blastocysts, and two (<i>PEG10</i> and <i>NNAT</i>) compared to Natur-IVF. Knock-out mice lacking <i>PEG10</i> showed early embryonic lethality with placental defects, indicating the importance of this gene in embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ono et al., 2006</a>). The protein encoded by <i>NNAT</i>, on the other hand, may be involved in the regulation of ion channels during brain development and may also play a role in forming and maintaining the structure of the nervous system. Defects in methylation at <i>ZAC1</i> and <i>IGF2R</i> have been found in patients with the imprinted disorders transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) or Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), respectively, including those born following the use of ART (<a href=\"#bib34\">Le Bouc et al., 2010</a>). In addition, genes related to the IGF axis, <i>IGF2BP2</i> and <i>IGF2BP2-IMP2</i>, were up-regulated in C-IVF, and <i>IGF2R</i> in both C-IVF and Natur-IVF embryos. Altered <i>IGF2BP2</i> expression in C-IVF is of interest, since reduced abundance of IGF2 has been associated with lower fetal weight after in vitro culture (<a href=\"#bib14\">El Hajj and Haaf, 2013</a>). The imprinting status of <i>IGF2R</i> in the pig is unclear (<a href=\"#bib26\">Killian et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Braunschweig, 2012</a>) but, independently of this uncertainty, our data indicated higher expression of this gene in the two in vitro groups of blastocysts, which would be in agreement with previous reports in other species and could indicate a possibility of LOS-related alterations observed in abnormal in vitro and cloned embryos (<a href=\"#bib55\">Young et al., 2001</a>). At the same time, the reduced methylation in <i>IGF2R</i> specifically in the C-IVF group could suggest that this group is more likely to be susceptible to sustained deregulation of <i>IGF2R</i> expression and a greater probability of LOS-like syndromes."

In human blastocysts, it has been observed that those with higher implantation rate and higher number of cells per embryo showed up-regulation of <i>DNMT3A</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kleijkers et al., 2015</a>). In our data, the In\u00a0vivo and Natur-IVF blastocysts showed a higher number of cells than those from the C-IVF group, in which expression of <i>DNMT3A</i> was decreased. We also observed higher expression of <i>CDKN1A</i> in the two in vitro groups, with an intermediate value in Natur-IVF. CDKN1A inhibits embryonic cell proliferation in response to DNA damage and it is considered one of the key genes responsible for the abnormalities in ART embryos since an aberrant increase of CDKN1A expression might be related to the growth-defect phenotype (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ishimura et al., 2016</a>). Methylation of the <i>CDKN1A</i> gene, however, was similar in all three groups, between 5\u00a0and\u00a07%. Other genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation were found to be altered, such as <i>MDM2</i> (in C-IVF) and <i>TP53INP</i> (up-regulated in Natur-IVF and C-IVF) and <i>HSPA4L, HSP40B1, HSPH1, HSP90</i> (down-regulated only in C-IVF). Altered expression of these genes may limit the ability of the embryo to respond to DNA damage, such that in vitro culture may lead to dysregulation of such genes, thus affecting long-term embryo viability (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zheng et al., 2005</a>). The same situation was found for <i>SLC2A3</i> (Glut-3) and <i>SLC2A2</i>, which have been related to LOS (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wrenzycki et al., 2004</a>) and were highly up-regulated in the two in vitro groups. Again, no differences at the methylation level were found for any of these genes. Although DNA methylation at the promoter/gene bodies is directly/indirectly correlated with gene expression, this is not strictly true during the periods of dramatic loss of DNA methylation, as occurs during early embryo development or primordial germ cells (PGC) formation. For example, <a href=\"#bib17\">Gkountela et al. (2015)</a> showed a general uncoupling between DNA methylation and gene expression during demethylation of PGCs, commenting \u2018Our data reveal a remarkable and pervasive loss of DNA methylation in human PGCs and AGCs during prenatal life that has almost no relationship to changes in gene expression\u2019. Comparative analyses between our methylation and gene expression data also showed this lack of correlation. In our opinion, at this stage of development and with this low level of methylation, this was an expected result."

This strategy, based on the addition of reproductive fluids in the culture media used during the ART procedures, can be applied in other animals as well as in humans, after safety concerns of transmission of diseases have been properly addressed. The design of new culture media containing all the proteins that are naturally present in the original biological fluid, represents not only a technical challenge but a biomedical responsibility that must be addressed to prevent future pathologies both in animals and humans. In addition, we offer a new protocol for the in vitro production of pig embryos with a significant improvement over the previous data published. Our study represents a new form of thinking in the field, far from the chemically defined culture media, and could help to face one of the biggest milestones of the current reproductive medicine: safer ART."

Once dissected, OF were collected by aspiration with an automatic pipette by introducing a 200\u00a0\u00b5l pipette tip into the ampulla and manually making an increasing pressure gradient from the isthmus to the ampulla. The UF was collected by making a manual increasing pressure gradient from the proximal end to the distal end (utero-tubal junction) of the uterine horn and letting the fluid drop into a sterile 50ml Falcon tube. Once recovered, samples (OF and UF) were centrifuged twice at 7000 <i>g</i> for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. Then the supernatant was immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Oviducts from animals at the late follicular phase (POF-LF) and at the early luteal phase (POF-EL) gave a mean volume of around 50 \u00b5l and 40 \u00b5l, respectively per oviduct. At the early luteal phase, approximately 10 ml of UF per uterine horn were collected each time. Aliquots of 50 \u00b5l OF and 50 ml UF of pooled samples from at least 20 animals for OF and five animals for UF were used. Only samples that passed quality controls (pH 7.0\u20137.6, osmolality 280\u2013320 mOsm/kg, endotoxin\u00a0&lt;0.10 EU/mL, a minimum 90% of Metaphase II oocytes after IVM with FF and ZP hardening for oocyte preincubation in POF-LF\u00a0&gt;1 hr) were used for experiments."

The analogy to breast milk is valid in some ways but in most ways not. Reproductive fluids are overwhelmingly less accessible than breast milk, and are likely to vary from patient to patient especially in pathologic circumstances. Even for breast milk, which is far more accessible, babies whose mothers are unable to breastfeed do not usually get fed breast milk from other women, but rather receive artificial formulas of greater and greater sophistication. Wet nursing is unlikely to make a big comeback in the future. Rather proteomic analysis of various fluids should make it possible to prepare reproducibly better and better artificial reproductive fluids."

These conclusions are not readily discernible from the data. In <a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">3</a>, C-IVF embryos produced a great percent of cleavage stage embryos and early blastocysts than Natur-IVF. Additionally, there was no significant difference between C-IVF and Natur-IVF in percent of blastocysts and expanded blastocyst formed or the yield. How does this show an improved outcome or advanced developmental stage? While there was a significant difference in hatching rate, it would appear that embryos were not left long enough to truly assess this, since 0 out of 903 C-IVF embryos and 48 out of 961 (5%) Natur-IVF had hatched."

The major questions that should be asked are whether there are expression/methylation changes between the three experimental groups and then where do these differences exist. Furthermore, what is the variation between embryos in the same group? The authors should present PCA graphs to visualize the three embryos and three groups. This should then be followed by pairwise comparisons for all groups, with VENN diagrams shown for all comparisons, including Natur-IVF and C-IVF. In fact, when the comparison is made (subsection \u201cNatur-IVF blastocysts show fewer aberrantly expressed genes than C-IVF blastocysts\u201d, second paragraph), only 29 differentially expressed genes were identified between Natur-IVF and C-IVF, demonstrating little difference in the cultured groups. Instead, as seen in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, greater differences were found between the in vivo group and the two cultured groups. For DNA methylation, there does not appear to be a significant difference between the three groups for total methylation levels or methylation levels over specific genomic features (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Here again, C-IVF and Natur-IVF groups need to be compared to determine how much they differ from each other. Finally, while comparisons between the in vivo and each culture group produced a differ subset of genes affected, there does not appear to great differences in the percent of genes misregulated (gene expression: C-IVF 68% up-, 32% down-regulated; Natur-IVF 69% up- and 31% down-regulated; DNA methylation: C-IVF 57% more and 43% less methylated; Natur-IVF 66% more and 34% less methylated).

It is recognised that not all imprinted genes are conserved in their imprinted status between species and, indeed, our analysis of the genome organisation of some of these genessuggested that they are unlikely to be imprinted in pig. In the case of SNPRN, in human and mouse this is a very complex imprinted locus in which there are multiple alternative promoters and associated CpG islands that have arisen through a complex series of genomic duplication events (for example, see Smith et al. 2011PLoSGenet. 7:e1002422) so, in the absence of further evidence, we did not feel it justified to attribute to any of possible CpG islands in the pig SNRPN locus the candidate igDMR. The fact that some imprinted genes could not be confidently identified based on comparative sequence organisation does not detract from the fact that we were able to identify 14 candidate igDMRs, which corresponds to more than half of the corresponding regions known from the mouse, and represents a very substantial subset and legitimises the analysis. Amongst these, we did detect significant differences in methylation at 3 igDMRs, and this finding is detailed in the text."

Also, when the analysis was targeted to CpG islands, we identified one differentially methylated CpGisland in the IGF2R gene. For this reason, and due to the importance of IGF2R in the anomalies observed after ART in animals, we thought it was important and legitimate to include it in this figure as an example of consistent methylation difference in our groups. Similarly, we thought it important to present the result for another igDMR (NNAT) that showed methylation differences between groups, given the importance of correct maintenance of methylation at imprinted genes."

The analogy to breast milk is valid in some ways but in most ways not. Reproductive fluids are overwhelmingly less accessible than breast milk, and are likely to vary from patient to patient especially in pathologic circumstances. Even for breast milk, which is far more accessible, babies whose mothers are unable to breastfeed do not usually get fed breast milk from other women, but rather receive artificial formulas of greater and greater sophistication. Wet nursing is unlikely to make a big comeback in the future. Rather proteomic analysis of various fluids should make it possible to prepare reproducibly better and better artificial reproductive fluids.</i>"

With the appropriate informed consents and legal permits, we are collecting these \u201chealth\u201d samples simply by introducing a special catheter throughthe vagina to the uterus in these donors and characterizing the proteomic profiles as well as other parameters. Bearing in mind that the amount of fluids needed is very small (we have used in the pig model 1% in the final volume of 500 \u03bcL) and that the volumes of culture medium in the human clinics are around 50 \u03bcL per embryo (or smaller microdrops), each sample collected from only one woman could be potentially used as additive for around 200-400 drops of 50 \u03bcL. So, if the beneficial effect were proved, it would not be so difficult to replace the current rHBSA used as protein additive in the human culture media by the corresponding reproductive fluid (previously tested, characterized and endotoxin-free)."

Human milk is the gold standard to provide nutritional support for all healthy and sick newborn infants including the very low birth weight (VLBW) infant (&lt;1500 g) (Johnston M et al. Pediatrics 2012) When own mother's milk it is unavailable, donor human milk is recommended as the first alternative, which could be obtained through human milk biobanks that are growing worldwide (Updegrove KH.

The pig blastocyst PBAT libraries had slightly higher sequence duplication rates and lower overall complexity, which probably reflects a slightly lower number of cells the single embryos. The unique sequence alignment rate (table above) is somewhat lower than we typically obtain by mapping PBAT data from mouse or human samples (65-70%), and this likely reflects the gaps in the pig genome assembly."

In contrast to microarrays, which always require qPCR validation, in RNAseq experiments probe bias, poor sensitivity and reduced linear range are not as problematic, since the entire transcript is assessed in a more or less unbiased manner (Wang Z, Gerstein M, Snyder M (2009) Nat Rev Genet 10: 57\u201363). In cases where there are discrepancies between RNAseq and qPCR, it would be most likely due to bias in the qPCR experiment (which has its own probe-bias based on what region of the cDNA is amplified). Ideally, we could re- validate our findings (potentially by qPCR) in a separate cohort of samples collected for a new experiment including new animals for the in vivo embryos (without guarantee of similarity with the ones already used), but we would consider to perform it only if reviewers consider it critical to publish our results."

Nonetheless, both percentages were higher than the best results previously described (Redel et al., 2016.

As reviewer points, \"the major questions that should be asked are whether there are expression/methylation changes between the three experimental groups and then where do these differences exist\". That is exactly what we tried to do here. After checking the quality of the data and the clustering of the embryos (now we have added the PCA plot), we did pairwise comparisons and found that, for gene expression analysis, and despite of individual variability, both in vitro groups were more similar between them than any of them compared to in vivo. For this reason, we started analyzing differences between each in vitro group compared to the in vivo one (789 and 623 genes out of 19,638) but continued looking at differences between the two in vitro groups (29 genes out of 19,638). First conclusion was that all the groups were similar, having only 4%, 3.17% and 0.15% DEGs, respectively, for each pairwise comparison. However, we also found that the general tendency for the Natur-IVF DEGs was to show intermediate values between the in vivo and C-IVF ones. And, finally, despite the scarce differences, we found that some DEGs between C-IVF and Natur-IVF could be critical because the corresponding knock out or knock-down studies in mice showed phenotypes of altered/abnormal growth/size, reproduction/fertility, mortality/aging, hematopoietic system, homeostasis/metabolism and other abnormalities. Bearing in mind that the alteration of just one gene could have consequences in the normal development of an embryo, we thought it was important to highlight some of the most representative genes.

We apologise for not having included the comparison between the two in vitro groups in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. Now it is included, with 3112 DMRs between both groups. Recognising these rare differences, we tried then to search for specific DMRs of obvious potential biological significance, thinking again of the impact that altered regulation of just a single gene could have for correct embryo development. For this reason, we first focused on the specific DMRs characterizing exclusively in each group (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C, D and E</a>) and second on the imprinted igDMRs. We were aware that by extracting only the DMRs with a consistent 5% significant change in all the three embryos of one group compared to the other we could be missing other differences occurring only in one individual but we decided this approach as an attempt of collecting at least a first list of potential DMRs having the highest probability to occur. Since we are providing here the first datasets of single pig blastocysts methylome and transcriptome, there are now multiple options of different valid analyses in future studies."

For example, Gounktela et al., 2015 showed that during demethylation of PGCs there is a general uncoupling between DNA methylation and gene expression at some stages; literally they say: \u201cOur data reveal a remarkable and pervasive loss of DNA methylation in human PGCs and AGCs during prenatal life that has almost no relationship to changes in gene expression\u201d.

The cyclic stage of animals was assessed once in the laboratory, on the basis of ovarian morphology on both ovaries from the same female. Oviducts and uteri were classified as early follicular, late follicular, early luteal or late luteal phase (Carrasco et al., 2008). Both oviducts and uteri coming from the same genital tract were classified as in the same stage of the cycle. Once classified, oviducts and uteri were separated and quickly washed once with 0.4% v/v cetrimide solution and twice in saline. Oviducts and uteri were dissected on Petri dishes or trays, respectively, sitting on ice. Once dissected, OF were collected by aspiration with an automatic pipette by introducing a 200\u00b5l pipette tip into the ampulla and manually making an increasing pressure gradient from the isthmus to the ampulla. The UF was collected by making a manual increasing pressure gradient from the proximal end to the distal end (utero-tubal junction) of the uterine horn and letting the fluid drop into a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube. Once recovered, samples (OF and UF) were centrifuged twice at 7000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. Then the supernatant was immediately stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Oviducts from animals at the late follicular phase (POF-LF) and at the early luteal phase (POF-EL) gave a mean volume of around 50\u00b5l and 40\u00b5l, respectively per oviduct. At the early luteal phase, approximately 10 ml of UF per uterine horn were collected each time. Aliquots of 50\u00b5l OF and 50ml UF of pooled samples from at least 20 animals for OF and 5 animals for UF were used.
