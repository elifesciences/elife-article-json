Here, we show that the cellular defects caused by dysregulated Dscam levels can be ameliorated by genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Abelson kinase (Abl) both in Dscam-overexpressing neurons and in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of fragile X syndrome. This study offers Abl as a potential therapeutic target for treating brain disorders associated with dysregulated Dscam expression."

Here, we show that the cellular defects caused by dysregulated Dscam levels can be ameliorated by genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Abelson kinase (Abl) both in Dscam-overexpressing neurons and in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of fragile X syndrome. This study offers Abl as a potential therapeutic target for treating brain disorders associated with dysregulated Dscam expression."

Recent research also suggests that fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) binds directly to the mRNAs of Dscam from mouse brain (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Darnell et al., 2011</a>), and studies in <i>Drosophila</i> neurons further confirmed that FMRP suppresses Dscam translation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cvetkovska et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kim et al., 2013</a>).

Currently, neither methods for targeting Dscam proteins nor those for targeting the signaling pathway activated by dysregulated Dscam are available, impeding the development of such therapies. In fact, very little is known about how Dscam signaling is transduced in vivo. In <i>Drosophila</i>, Dscam has previously been shown to bind to Dock (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schmucker et al., 2000</a>), while in mammals it has been shown to associate with Uncoordinated-5C, Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Fyn kinase, and PAK1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li and Guan, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Purohit et al., 2012</a>).

However, evidence demonstrating the requirement of these potential interactors for the defects that arise from increased Dscam expression is lacking.

For example, loss of <i>Dscam</i> causes C4da presynaptic terminals to fail to grow while increased Dscam levels lead to increased presynaptic terminal growth (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). From tests of candidate genes that potentially mediate Dscam function, including FAK, Fyn, PAK, RhoA, and Abl, we identified Abl as a key molecule mediating Dscam's functions in presynaptic terminal growth. We first asked whether Abl is sufficient to promote presynaptic terminal growth in C4da neurons. Consistent with a previous study performed in <i>Drosophila</i> adult CNS neurons (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leyssen et al., 2005</a>), overexpression of Abl in C4da neurons caused significant overgrowth of the presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,E</a>). Since Abl is known to have both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Henkemeyer et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schwartzberg et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tybulewicz et al., 1991</a>), we tested whether expression of a kinase-dead form of Abl, Abl-K417N (<a href=\"#bib16\">Henkemeyer et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wills et al., 1999b</a>), could promote presynaptic terminal growth. We found that C4da presynaptic terminals overexpressing Abl-K417N were indistinguishable from wild-type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>), indicating that Abl kinase activity is required. Consistent with the idea that Abl kinase activation is important, expression of a constitutively active form of Abl, BCR-Abl, led to extremely exuberant overgrowth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that Abl is sufficient to promote presynaptic terminal growth and that the extent to which Abl instructs presynaptic terminal growth is related to Abl kinase activation."

In contrast, Dscam\u0394Cyto did not co-immunoprecipitate Abl (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, furthest right lane). These results suggest that Dscam and Abl proteins form a complex through Dscam's cytoplasmic domain. Next, to test the in vivo interaction of Dscam and Abl in presynaptic terminals specifically, we determined whether Abl localization in presynaptic terminals was altered by the expression of Dscam or Dscam\u0394Cyto (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

                        "text": "Do increased Dscam levels activate Abl kinase? In mammals, autophosphorylation of Abl at tyrosines 245 and 412 (Y245 and Y412) stabilizes the active conformation of the kinase (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brasher and Van Etten, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Tanis et al., 2003</a>). As a result, phospho-specific antibodies raised against Y412 have been employed to detect active Abl kinases (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brasher and Van Etten, 2000</a>). This approach has been used successfully to recognize the phosphorylation of the corresponding tyrosines (Y539/522) in <i>Drosophila</i> as an assay for Abl kinase activation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stevens et al., 2008</a>). Since the ability of Abl to instruct presynaptic terminal growth relies on Abl kinase activity, we tested whether Dscam activates Abl using a phosho-Y412-Abl (p-Abl) antibody. We found that Abl kinase activation was significantly increased (2.6 fold) when Abl and Dscam were co-expressed in S2 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Furthermore, unlike wild-type Dscam, Dscam\u0394Cyto did not increase Abl kinase activation. In fact, it appears to act as a dominant-negative, as Abl activity was significantly decreased from control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right). As a negative control, no signal was detected when the kinase-dead Abl-K417N was blotted with p-Abl antibody in the same assay, suggesting that our assay specifically reported Abl activation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that Dscam enhances Abl kinase activity. To investigate whether the same is true in presynaptic terminals in vivo, we devised a novel method of reporting Abl activation specifically in C4da presynaptic terminals. To achieve this, we used a previously reported probe that reports Abl activity, Pickles2.31 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mizutani et al., 2010</a>). Pickles2.31 is composed of a fragment of a characteristic Abl substrate, CrkL, sandwiched between the fluorescent proteins Venus and enhanced CFP (ECFP) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). It has previously been reported that activated Abl phosphorylates Pickles2.31 on the Y207 residue of the CrkL fragment, which can be detected with an antibody against CrkL-phospho-Y207 (p-CrkL) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mizutani et al., 2010</a>). After expressing Pickles2.31 specifically in C4da neurons with the <i>ppk</i>-Gal4 driver, we dissected the larval CNS and immunoprecipitated Pickles2.31 from the lysates. Since the cell bodies of C4da neurons reside in the body wall, using only the larval CNS allowed us to monitor Pickles2.31 phosphorylation only in the C4da neuron presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We found that overexpression of Dscam in C4da neurons led to an increase in Y207 phosphorylation of Pickles2.31 in the presynaptic terminals, while overexpression of Dscam\u0394Cyto was indistinguishable from control (mCD8-mRFP) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Consistent with the notion that Pickles2.31 is an Abl activity indicator, overexpression of BCR-Abl led to a robust increase in phospho-Y207 levels as compared to the control. These results suggest that Dscam activates Abl both in culture and in C4da presynaptic terminals in vivo, and that this activation requires the cytoplasmic domain of Dscam."

Abl is a well-established target for treating chronic myeloid leukemia, and there are multiple Abl inhibitors that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a proof-of-concept experiment, we attempted to rescue the developmental defects caused by Dscam overexpression using Abl inhibitors. We first tested nilotinib, which is a FDA-approved second-generation Abl kinase inhibitor that can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (<a href=\"#bib38\">Weisberg et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hebron et al., 2013</a>). Using cultured S2 cells overexpressing Abl, we found that nilotinib robustly inhibited <i>Drosophila</i> Abl (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Based on these results, we tested whether administration of nilotinib to developing larvae could rescue the effects of increased Dscam expression in C4da presynaptic terminals in vivo. To do this, we performed MARCM to visualize single C4da neurons in animals fed nilotinib or vehicle and assessed presynaptic terminal length. While overexpression of Dscam caused increased (152%) presynaptic terminal length in animals fed vehicle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>), the effect was significantly rescued (to 115% of control) by feeding the animals with nilotinib (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,E</a>).

Consistent with the idea that nilotinib acts on Abl rather than on an off-target molecule to rescue presynaptic terminal growth, administering nilotinib to larvae overexpressing Dscam in <i>abl</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> clones did not lead to a further decrease in presynaptic terminal length when compared to vehicle-fed control (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C,D,G</a>). To further rule out the possibility that the observed rescue of presynaptic terminal length by nilotinib was the result of an off-target effect, we tested bafetinib, another Abl inhibitor with non-overlapping off-targets, Fyn and Lyn (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kimura et al., 2005</a>). Bafetinib has also been shown to cross the blood brain barrier (<a href=\"#bib32\">Santos et al., 2010</a>). Like nilotinib, administration of bafetinib to Dscam-overexpressing larvae led to a significant decrease in presynaptic terminal length (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A,B,F,G</a>) without changing the expression of the Dscam transgene (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Given how little is known about signal transduction downstream of Dscam, this is significant. Further, the observation that Dscam signaling in regulating presynaptic arbor size and dendrite self-avoidance involves different molecular mechanisms is an interesting discovery. The studies demonstrating that Dscam can interact with Abl and promote Abl activation in S2 cells support the model that Dscam modulates Abl activity in neurons, but demonstrating the interaction in neurons would substantially improve the manuscript. Finally, the authors convincingly show that the Abl pharmacological inhibitor nilotinib can suppress presynaptic arbor overgrowth induced by Dscam or FMRP mutation, but the mechanism of action is unclear. The following substantive concerns need to be addressed."

The value of using a fly model to test potential drug targets is that we can gain a full understanding of any possible off-target or side effects. Thus, it is equally important that they show other aspects of the neurons and animal health etc. are, or are not, affected by the drug treatment. Moreover, one can't find any data showing how the dose of nilotinib treatment, which would be highly relevant for any further interests in translational application, was decided."

The assertion that the effects on presynaptic arbor size reflect inhibition of Abl activation is not convincing.

The decrease in phospho-tyrosine in 3b demonstrates a general decrease in the CNS, and does not necessarily show a specific targeting of Abl. This must be addressed. To demonstrate specificity, a possible experiment is to repeat the experiment shown in 3B in flies that are mutated in the Abl phosphorylation site Tyr412, or simply null for Abl. If nilotinib is specific to blocking phospho-Abl, there should be no difference in p-Tyr levels whether or not nilotinib is added, if Abl phospho-sites are blocked or Abl is missing. However, if addition of nilotinib still results in a decrease in p-Tyr even when Abl phospho-sites are blocked, this suggests nilotinib is having an effect on the catalytic activity of other kinases."

Moreover, the nilotinib treatment in our experiments likely partially inhibited Abl activity for three reasons. First, the efficacy of presynaptic arbor rescue in Dscam overexpressing neurons was partial as compared to the complete rescue achieved by homozygous <i>Abl</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mutations (compare new <span class=\"underline\">Figure 4B-G</span> with new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F-K and O</a>).

Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that the maternally contributed Abl is insufficient for the Dscam-induced presynaptic overgrowth caused by Dscam overexpression or genetic mutations of <i>FMRP</i>."
