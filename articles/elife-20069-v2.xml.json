When the UPR is inactive, <i>HAC1</i> mRNA is stored as an unspliced isoform in the cytoplasm and no Hac1 protein is detectable. Intron removal is both necessary and sufficient to relieve the post-transcriptional silencing of <i>HAC1</i> mRNA, yet the precise mechanism by which the intron prevents Hac1 protein accumulation has remained elusive. Here, we show that a combination of inhibited translation initiation and accelerated protein degradation\u2014both dependent on the intron\u2014prevents the accumulation of Hac1 protein when the UPR is inactive. Functionally, both components of this fail-safe silencing mechanism are required to prevent ectopic production of Hac1 protein and concomitant activation of the UPR. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of <i>HAC1</i> regulation and reveal a novel strategy for complete post-transcriptional silencing of a cytoplasmic mRNA."

When the UPR is inactive, <i>HAC1</i> mRNA is stored as an unspliced isoform in the cytoplasm and no Hac1 protein is detectable. Intron removal is both necessary and sufficient to relieve the post-transcriptional silencing of <i>HAC1</i> mRNA, yet the precise mechanism by which the intron prevents Hac1 protein accumulation has remained elusive. Here, we show that a combination of inhibited translation initiation and accelerated protein degradation\u2014both dependent on the intron\u2014prevents the accumulation of Hac1 protein when the UPR is inactive. Functionally, both components of this fail-safe silencing mechanism are required to prevent ectopic production of Hac1 protein and concomitant activation of the UPR. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of <i>HAC1</i> regulation and reveal a novel strategy for complete post-transcriptional silencing of a cytoplasmic mRNA."

The Hac1 protein is responsible for helping the cell deal with certain types of stress, so it only accumulates when the cell is experiencing such stresses. The mRNA that encodes Hac1 (referred to as <i>HAC1</i> mRNA) contains a sequence called an intron. These sequences are normally cut out of mRNAs before they are read by the ribosome. However, the intron in the <i>HAC1</i> mRNA is unusual, because it is only removed when cells are subjected to stress. The rest of the time, this intron serves to block the production of Hac1 through a poorly understood mechanism."

One strategy relies on a structure formed in the <i>HAC1</i> mRNA that prevents ribosomes from starting translation in the first place. However, this block is occasionally bypassed, causing some Hac1 protein to be produced when it should not be. To deal with this, the Hac1 protein that is produced contains a short protein sequence, encoded by the intron, that targets this unneeded protein for degradation. These two strategies together comprise a \u201cfail-safe\u201d mechanism to completely repress the <i>HAC1</i> mRNA."

In the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the central effector of the UPR is the transcription factor Hac1p (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cox and Walter, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Mori et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nikawa et al., 1996</a>). <i>HAC1</i> (and its metazoan ortholog <i>Xbp1</i>) is unique among eukaryotic genes in that it contains an intron that is excised through an unconventional cytoplasmic splicing reaction mediated by two proteins, Ire1p and tRNA ligase, rather than the spliceosome (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cox and Walter, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kawahara et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sidrauski and Walter, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sidrauski et al., 1996</a>). In the absence of ER protein-folding stress, the intron-containing mRNA (denoted <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i>; \u2018u\u2019 for UPR \u2018uninduced\u2019) is transcribed and exported to the cytoplasm but does not give rise to detectable protein due to the presence of the inhibitory intron (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cox and Walter, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman and Walter, 1997</a>). The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen activates the ER-resident transmembrane kinase\u2013endonuclease Ire1p, which cleaves out the intron from <i>HAC1</i> mRNA via its cytoplasmic nuclease domain (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sidrauski and Walter, 1997</a>). After the exons are joined by tRNA ligase, the resulting spliced mRNA (denoted <i>HAC1<sup>i</sup></i>; \u2018i\u2019 for UPR \u2018induced\u2019) is now translated into Hac1<sup>i</sup>p. This active transcription factor is imported into the nucleus, where it activates the expression of UPR target genes involved in restoring protein-folding homeostasis in the ER (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chapman et\u00a0al., 1998</a>). Intron removal is both necessary and sufficient to relieve the post-transcriptional silencing of <i>HAC1</i> that otherwise prevents Hac1p accumulation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman and Walter, 1997</a>)."

At the same time, a robust silencing mechanism is required to prevent ectopic accumulation of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p from the abundant cytoplasmic pool of <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA that might otherwise turn on UPR target genes in the absence of ER stress. The current model for silencing is that elongating ribosomes are stalled on the mRNA during translation, thereby preventing synthesis of full-length Hac1p (<a href=\"#bib34\">R\u00fcegsegger et al., 2001</a>). According to this model, the mediator of translational attenuation is a long-range base-pairing interaction between the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) and intron of <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA."

However, the sequence of the base-pairing region can be changed without affecting silencing if base pairing is preserved (<a href=\"#bib34\">R\u00fcegsegger et al., 2001</a>), making it unlikely that any sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins are involved. In addition, the more recent discovery of the No-Go Decay (NGD) pathway that recognizes stalled ribosomes and targets the associated mRNA for degradation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Doma and Parker, 2006</a>) raises the question of how the ribosome\u2013<i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNP evades detection and subsequent turnover by the quality-control machinery.

Rather than providing evidence for stalled ribosomes on <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA, instead these observations suggest that either ribosomes are stalled on the mRNA in a closely packed configuration that prevents nuclease cleavage between ribosomes, which would eliminate the\u00a0~28-nucleotide fragments that are sequenced in the ribosome-profiling method (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, middle); or that there are not stalled ribosomes on <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, bottom)."

We therefore devised an experiment to definitively determine whether the ribosomes bound to <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA reflect ribosomes that were engaged in its translation. To do so, we took advantage of the observation that <i>HAC1</i> mRNA is distributed across all of the translating fractions of a sucrose gradient (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). If the deep sedimentation is due to multiple translating ribosomes being stalled on a single mRNA, then reducing the number of translating ribosomes that can fit on the mRNA should shift the sedimentation pattern toward lighter fractions. We designed a series of constructs containing point mutations in the first exon of <i>HAC1</i> that created premature termination codons, which reduce the size of the ORF and thereby limit the number of translating ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, top). To ensure that the mutant alleles were expressed at near wild-type levels, we replaced the endogenous <i>HAC1</i> allele without disrupting flanking regulatory regions. Remarkably, each of the mutant mRNAs had a sedimentation pattern that was indistinguishable from the wild-type mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, bottom). In the most extreme case, the mRNA containing a 21-nucleotide ORF that can only accommodate a single translating ribosome still co-sedimented with polysomes containing upwards of 10 ribosomes (fraction 14 of the gradient).

To further understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we used a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter system that has been previously shown to recapitulate post-transcriptional silencing by the <i>HAC1</i> intron (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman and Walter, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">R\u00fcegsegger et al., 2001</a>). We replaced the first exon of <i>HAC1</i> with the GFP ORF lacking its own stop codon (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), which allowed us to quantitatively analyze post-transcriptional silencing of GFP using a combination of flow cytometry (protein abundance), quantitative RT-PCR (mRNA abundance), and sucrose gradient fractionation (ribosome density). When <i>GFP</i> was embedded in an otherwise wild-type <i>HAC1</i> context the mRNA sedimented almost entirely in the non-translating fractions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and there was no detectable fluorescence above background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast, cells expressing a reporter construct missing the entire intron displayed a strong fluorescence signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and most of the mRNA was found in the translating fractions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Thus, the reporter <i>GFP</i> mRNA behaves similarly to endogenous <i>HAC1</i> mRNA."

Because disrupting translation of the tail elevated protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) without affecting polysome formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), we inferred that the tail was exerting its effect downstream of translation initiation. We therefore reasoned that the 10-amino-acid sequence was acting either by halting translation across the entire mRNA (after polysome formation); or by promoting protein degradation. Our inability to detect GFP containing the 10-amino-acid tail (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) prevented us from directly comparing the half lives of GFP with and without the tail. Instead, to distinguish between stalled elongation and protein degradation, we designed a reporter construct that generates two separate polypeptides from a single round of translation through co-translational \u2018cleavage\u2019 mediated by a viral 2A peptide (Sharma et al., 2012). After screening for a 2A peptide sequence that functions efficiently in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we designed a construct containing HA-mRuby and GFP sequences separated by the P2A peptide (derived from porcine teschovirus-1). The GFP sequence downstream of P2A was appended with the 10-amino-acid tail (or was not, as a control), which should lead to the absence of detectable GFP regardless of the mechanism of action. In contrast, the upstream HA-tagged mRuby should only be detected if translation itself is not affected by the 10-amino-acid sequence, since it reports on the number of rounds of translation but is not covalently linked to the inhibitory tail. Assaying for GFP by immunoblotting revealed that accumulation of the protein was suppressed by the 10-amino-acid tail, as expected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast, HA-mRuby was detected at similar levels whether or not the tail was included in the construct. These results indicate that the tail functions downstream of translation, likely by acting as a \u2018degron\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Varshavsky, 1991</a>) that targets the protein for immediate degradation after synthesis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cox and Walter, 1996</a>)."

To identify such <i>trans</i>-acting factors, we used a genetic approach that took advantage of the strong silencing phenotype imparted by the 10-amino-acid tail alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We constructed strains in which the first exon of <i>HAC1</i> was replaced by <i>HIS3</i>, which we reasoned might behave like the analogous <i>GFP</i> reporter genes and be completely silenced by the 10-amino-acid sequence. Similarly to <i>GFP</i>, replacing the first exon of <i>HAC1</i> with <i>HIS3</i> but keeping the <i>HAC1</i> locus otherwise intact prevented expression of His3p as evidenced by histidine auxotrophy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Removing the entire intron restored His3p expression and growth of the corresponding strain on medium lacking histidine, suggesting that silencing was mediated by the <i>HAC1</i> intron. Strains containing a stop codon between <i>HIS3</i> and the intron (to prevent translation of the 10-amino-acid degron) had a low but detectable level of growth on histidine-lacking medium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), consistent with the weak fluorescence signal observed from the corresponding <i>GFP</i> reporter construct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). On the other hand, strains containing His3p appended with the C-terminal tail of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p but no other elements of the <i>HAC1</i> intron could not grow on medium lacking histidine. These results indicate that the degron is sufficient for functional silencing of <i>HIS3</i> expression, providing a useful genetic tool to identify additional genes involved in the degron-dependent silencing mechanism."

We sequenced the 24 genomes together in a single lane of a HiSeq sequencer using 50-nucleotide single-end reads, which provided 38\u201374X coverage (9.3\u201318.0 million reads) of each yeast genome. We then used standard mapping and variant-calling tools (BWA and FreeBayes, respectively) to identify variants that were absent from the parental genome, which successfully recovered the positive-control <i>cis</i> mutants. Remarkably, 17 out of the 20 strains that we sequenced contained a mutation in the same gene <i>YJL149W</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), and in each case we confirmed the mutation by Sanger sequencing (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

In addition, three of the 17 strains containing mutations in <i>DUH1</i> did not contain any other mutations, implicating the <i>DUH1</i> mutations as causative for the phenotype. We therefore tested whether knocking-out <i>DUH1</i> (which is non-essential) in the original selection strain recapitulated the de-silencing phenotype. Disrupting <i>DUH1</i> led to a dramatic increase in the steady-state abundance of HA-His3p containing the 10-amino-acid tail, while having no effect on HA-His3p lacking the tail or constructs repressed by long-range base pairing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Analogously, deleting <i>DUH1</i> in the GFP reporter strains completely eliminated the silencing effect of the Hac1<sup>u</sup>p tail but had no effect on base-pairing-mediated silencing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Notably, in the absence of <i>DUH1</i> the GFP reporter in a wild-type <i>HAC1</i> context was now expressed at the same leaky level as previously seen for the reporter in which a stop codon was positioned between <i>GFP</i> and the intron, indicating that degron-dependent silencing is required to suppress leaky GFP expression. Together, these results provide genetic evidence that <i>DUH1</i> is the adapter protein that recognizes the Hac1<sup>u</sup>p tail and targets the covalently attached protein for degradation."

All of the mRNAs encoding HA-tagged Hac1p variants were expressed at similar levels in the presence versus the absence of <i>DUH1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Strikingly, at the protein level only the abundance of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p was affected by disruption of <i>DUH1</i>, increasing by\u00a0~five fold in the knock-out strain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The increased abundance of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p in the absence of <i>DUH1</i> was not due to increased translation, as evidenced by deletion of <i>DUH1</i> having no impact on ribosome density on any of the HA-tagged reporter mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Instead, our results suggest that Duh1p specifically affects the turnover of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p due to its 10-amino-acid tail, as was suggested by the results of our reporter experiments."

In both the presence and absence of <i>DUH1</i>, Hac1<sup>u</sup>p was degraded so rapidly that we could not accurately measure its half life even using a rapid harvesting procedure, due to the\u00a0~2 minutes required for CHX to accumulate in cells and halt translation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gerashchenko and Gladyshev, 2014</a>).

Deletion of <i>DUH1</i> stabilized Hac1<sup>u</sup>p and increased its half-life upper bound to 2 minutes.

Our results using constructs in which the base-pairing region was deleted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) suggested that the previously observed accumulation of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p was unknowingly being buffered by Duh1p-dependent degradation. To directly address this possibility, we generated HA-tagged constructs in which the base-pairing region was disrupted by mutations in either the 5\u2032-UTR or intron or was reconstituted by the compensatory mutations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and determined the effect of <i>DUH1</i> deletion on steady-state protein levels.

The existence of such a fail-safe silencing mechanism implies that ectopic production of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p has physiological consequences that negatively impact cellular fitness. However, a previous study suggested that Hac1<sup>u</sup>p is itself not an active transcription factor because it lacks the activating 18-amino-acid tail found in Hac1<sup>i</sup>p (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mori et al., 2000</a>), raising the question as to why Hac1<sup>u</sup>p accumulation would need to be tightly regulated. We hypothesized that Hac1<sup>u</sup>p was in fact an active transcription factor but that in the previous study its accumulation had been prevented due to the experiments being performed in a <i>DUH1</i> background. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of strains that constitutively produced either Hac1<sup>i</sup>p, Hac1<sup>u</sup>p, or Hac1<sup>\u0394tail</sup>p to grow under conditions of chronic ER stress induced by the drug tunicamycin. Strains expressing Hac1<sup>i</sup>p or Hac1<sup>\u0394tail</sup>p grew on tunicamycin-containing medium regardless of whether <i>DUH1</i> (or <i>IRE1</i>) was present (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), consistent with both proteins being active transcription factors that are not targeted by Duh1p. In contrast, strains expressing Hac1<sup>u</sup>p only grew robustly on tunicamycin-containing medium when <i>DUH1</i> was knocked out (but independently of <i>IRE1</i>). These results confirm our hypothesis that Duh1p-dependent degradation normally masks the activity of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p. Our findings also explain how <i>HAC1</i> was able to be initially identified as a high-copy activator of the UPR in an <i>\u0394ire1</i> strain, since the UPR activity detected in this strain had to have resulted from Hac1<sup>u</sup>p produced from unspliced <i>HAC1</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman and Walter, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cox and Walter, 1996</a>)."

At the highest tunicamycin concentration only strains expressing <i>IRE1</i> could grow regardless of whether <i>DUH1</i> was also present (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), suggesting that growth was dependent on the abundant Hac1<sup>i</sup>p produced from <i>HAC1</i><sup>i</sup> mRNA.

The initial silencing mechanism that acts on <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA is a block to translation initiation, which is caused by secondary structure in the 5\u2032-UTR that inhibits binding or progression of the scanning ribosome. However, this silencing mechanism does not entirely prevent translation, allowing the production of small amounts of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p. Because Hac1<sup>u</sup>p is an active transcription factor, even small amounts of this protein produced by leaky translation could activate the UPR and affect cellular physiology. To prevent this, a second silencing mechanism exists to rapidly degrade any Hac1<sup>u</sup>p that is produced by leaky translation. By relying on recognition of the unique C-terminal tail of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p by the F-box protein Duh1p, the protein-degradation mechanism selectively targets Hac1<sup>u</sup>p for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Because both translational repression and protein degradation rely on sequences found in the intron of <i>HAC1</i>, removal of the intron by Ire1p-dependent splicing simultaneously results in the inactivation of both silencing mechanisms. In this way, splicing allows the rapid accumulation of Hac1<sup>i</sup>p from the existing pool of <i>HAC1</i> mRNA."

Instead, our results using mRNAs containing premature stop codons and using a modified lysis buffer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) indicate that translation initiation on <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA almost never occurs due to the 5\u2032-UTR\u2013intron base-pairing interaction. The lack of appreciable translation of <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA suggests that the substrate for Ire1p-dependent splicing is untranslated mRNA, rather than polysomal mRNA containing stalled ribosomes as originally proposed (<a href=\"#bib34\">R\u00fcegsegger et al., 2001</a>). A corollary of this is that the synthesis of Hac1<sup>i</sup>p requires <i>de novo</i> translation initiation on <i>HAC1<sup>i</sup></i> mRNA, rather than just the resumption of translation by stalled ribosomes that initiated on <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA. The initial hint that <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA is translationally repressed at the initiation rather than elongation stage came from ribosome-profiling data, which revealed a lack of ribosome-protected fragments derived from <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA (<a href=\"#bib43\">Weinberg et al., 2016</a>).

Moreover, the discontinuous distribution of <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA that matches the peaks and valleys observed for polysomes (<a href=\"#bib34\">R\u00fcegsegger et al., 2001</a>) indicates that <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA is associated with integral numbers of actual 80<i>S</i> ribosomes. On the basis of these data, we propose that electrostatic interactions between <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA and either non-translating 80<i>S</i> ribosomes or, more likely, bona fide polysomes (containing both ribosomes and mRNA) are responsible for its polysome-like sedimentation. <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA may be especially prone to such non-specific interactions because of the strong initiation block, though other untranslated mRNA molecules (including the small fraction of ribosome-free mRNA molecules observed even for well-translated genes) may also behave similarly. In this regard, the analysis method (i.e., use of constructs containing premature stop codons) and experimental tools (i.e., exogenous RNA controls combined with heparin-containing lysis buffer) that we utilized here to definitively establish the translation state of <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA will be generally useful in polysome-profiling studies in the future."

The genetic selection that we performed to identify components of the protein-degradation pathway yielded just a single gene with recurrent mutations: <i>DUH1</i>. Our failure to isolate mutations in other components of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome machinery (i.e., the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that presents the ubiquitin to the Duh1p-containing SCF complex for transfer onto Hac1<sup>u</sup>p; and subunits of the proteasome itself) may reflect the pleiotropic nature of such mutations, which would hinder growth despite the <i>HIS3</i> reporter gene being de-silenced; an extreme case is the essential gene encoding the sole E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in yeast, <i>UBA1</i>. In addition, our reliance on spontaneous mutagenesis made it unlikely that we would have isolated multiple mutations in redundant sets of genes, which may also explain our failure to isolate E2 mutants given their sometimes overlapping functions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 1993</a>). Nonetheless, the fact that we isolated 16 different mutations in <i>DUH1</i> in 17 of our 20 sequenced strains illustrates the power of our genetic selection system. A noteworthy feature of our selection was that by combining spontaneous mutagenesis with whole-genome sequencing, we were able to rapidly go directly from phenotypic mutants to genotypic mutations without any crosses and relying on only simple computational tools for analysis."

But why does budding yeast rely on a pair of silencing mechanisms to prevent accumulation of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p, rather than just completely blocking translation in the first place? An intriguing possibility is that the marginal stability of the 5\u2032-UTR\u2013intron base-pairing interaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) is the cause of leaky translation but is also required to make the translational repression reversible (<a href=\"#bib34\">R\u00fcegsegger et al., 2001</a>). If the base-pairing interaction were more stable and prevented translation altogether, splicing might not be sufficient for the intron to dissociate from the 5\u2032-UTR despite their being covalently unlinked. Another possibility is that the act of translating the mRNA has a function. For example, a pioneer round of translation on <i>HAC1<sup>u</sup></i> mRNA might be required to form the 5\u2032-UTR\u2013intron interaction that inhibits subsequent rounds of translation. Such a requirement might be due to the ribosome physically bringing the distant sequences together through a tethering mechanism, or due to the ribosome unwinding alternative competing structures that initially form with the ORF. A third possibility is that the small amount of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p being constantly produced and degraded has a function. In particular, the ability to regulate accumulation of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p through Duh1p without relying on Ire1p activation would provide a means of rapidly producing a small pool of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p in the absence of ER protein-folding stress. A constitutively produced yet transient pool of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p might also contribute to the switch-like behavior of the UPR, based on the predicted ability of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p to heterodimerize with Hac1<sup>i</sup>p and thereby facilitate proteasomal degradation of any Hac1<sup>i</sup>p produced from background splicing (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Our findings suggest that inhibition by 5\u2032-UTR secondary structure may also be incomplete, potentially due to the action of RNA helicases that are constantly unwinding RNA structures <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rouskin et al., 2014</a>).

Existing data supported a model where blockage of initiation by base-pairing between the intron and 5'UTR prevented HAC1 translation. It was assumed that this blockage somehow also stalled 80S elongating ribosomes and thereby accounted for the migration in heavy polysome fractions. Recently, ribosome profiling datasets revealed that the mRNA did not appear to be bound to translating 80S ribosomes. Experiments in this manuscript resolve this contradiction by showing the old polysome profiling methods were flawed and that the base-pairing between intron and 5'UTR does appear to block most translation from initiating. Surprisingly, however, the authors also found that elimination of this base-pairing interaction did not result in protein production, even though it does lead to migration of the mRNA in heavy polysome fractions (as observed by an improved polysome profiling method)."

This tag is recognized by a previously unknown E3 ligase that results in degradation of any Hac1 protein that happens to be produced from the unspliced transcript. Presumably, this system is important for eliminating protein produced by low levels of HAC1 translation that escape the initiation-based inhibition mechanism. The paper therefore reveals a new layer of regulation of this regulatory network and opens up many new questions for the field to explore."

E.g., the clever use of reporters/ mutant strains/ and new technologies mean there is no confusion regarding the source of regulatory control. The problem of mRNA co-sedimentation with polysomes in the absence of translation is satisfyingly dealt with, although it will likely to confound the literature for some time to come. The sequencing of spontaneous suppressor mutants to define the second-phase repression by proteolysis is also lovely."
