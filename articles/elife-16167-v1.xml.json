However, psychophysical experiments that use larger stimuli to activate larger pools of neurons sometimes report impoverished perceptual performance. To determine the neural mechanisms underlying these paradoxical findings, we trained monkeys to discriminate the direction of motion of visual stimuli that varied in size across trials, while simultaneously recording from populations of motion-sensitive neurons in cortical area MT. We used the resulting data to constrain a computational model that explained the behavioral data as an interaction of three main mechanisms: noise correlations, which prevented stimulus information from growing with stimulus size; neural surround suppression, which decreased sensitivity for large stimuli; and a read-out strategy that emphasized neurons with receptive fields near the stimulus center. These results suggest that paradoxical percepts reflect tradeoffs between sensitivity and noise in neuronal populations."

One example concerns moving objects: when they are small, we can identify their direction of motion easily, but this becomes much more difficult for larger objects. This decreased perceptual sensitivity appears to be linked to other mental processes. For example, studies have suggested that people with high IQs have more difficulty perceiving the motion of large objects, whereas people with various psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, are better able to see such movement. Although several theories have been proposed, there is currently no good explanation for these findings."

The electrical activity of nerve cells in the part of the visual cortex that deals with movement was recorded while the monkeys performed this task.

One is that neuronal responses are modulated by multiple stimulus dimensions, so that identical responses can be associated with very different stimuli. Another reason is that single-neuron responses can be quite variable, so that the response to the same stimulus can differ from one presentation to the next."

Because neurons in early visual structures have small receptive fields, large stimuli recruit more neurons, potentially leading to more effective coding of stimulus properties and correspondingly better behavioral performance. It is therefore surprising that behavioral studies in humans have sometimes found that larger stimuli are associated with diminished perceptual performance (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tadin et al., 2003</a>). Moreover, this <i>psychophysical suppression</i> of behavioral performance in human subjects is strongly correlated with various markers of mental function, including schizophrenia, major depression, and even I.Q (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tadin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Golomb et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Melnick et al., 2013</a>).

Our neurophysiological recordings revealed that the magnitude of the neuronal surround suppression of <i>individual</i> neurons is too small to account for psychophysical suppression. However, analysis of multi-electrode recordings revealed a novel aspect of neuronal noise correlations that further suppressed population coding for large stimuli: those neurons with the smallest surround suppression, and hence the ones most sensitive to large stimuli individually, also had noise correlations most closely aligned with signal correlations; such correlations are damaging to the total information carried by the population (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott and Dayan, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Averbeck et al., 2006</a>).

Moreover, many neurons exhibited no surround suppression at all, even for stimuli extending beyond their receptive fields (<a href=\"#bib10\">Born and Tootell, 1992</a>), and the selectivity of these neurons to large stimuli routinely exceeded that of the monkeys (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>).

To study this relationship across the population (N = 370 pairs), we classified neurons as surround suppressed (SS) or not (NS), based on a simple median split of the SI<sub>neu</sub> distribution (<a href=\"#bib23\">Glasser et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This yielded three types of neuron pairs: both suppressed (SS-SS), both non-suppressed (NS-NS), and mixed (SS-NS). Across the population, the magnitudes of <i>r</i><sub>noise</sub> were not significantly different across types of neuron pairs (Wilcoxon rank sum tests, p&gt;0.86). However, the correlation structure differed substantially for different cell classes: For the NS-NS pairs, <i>r</i><sub>noise</sub> and <i>r</i><sub>signal</sub> tended to be correlated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, red dots). By contrast pairs of SS neurons showed less of a dependency of noise correlation on signal correlation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, blue dots).

Also, sampling from rate-matched sub-distributions of SS-SS and NS-NS pairs (Materials and methods) yielded significantly higher <i>r</i><sub>noise</sub> vs. <i>r</i><sub>signal</sub> slopes for the NS-NS sub-distributions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; Wilcoxon rank sum test, p&lt;0.001).

In brief, we generated populations of synthetic neurons by sampling neural properties from a joint truncated Normal distribution over tuning curve parameters inferred from our measurements. In that way we could simulate neural populations that not only matched the observed marginal statistics but also the correlations between the measured parameters (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since we only measured neurons with RFs covering approximately the central 5\u00b0 of the stimulus, we extrapolated from these neurons to those at larger eccentricities by shifting the size tuning curves of our measured neurons according to the distance between the simulated RF and the center of the stimulus. Furthermore, we scaled the number of model neurons according to the observed dependency of the magnification factor on eccentricity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Van Essen et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Erickson et al., 1989</a>). We sampled the noise correlation structure from a Wishart distribution around the empirical means as a function of the signal correlation between neuron pairs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). By generating many such populations for each model, we extracted a range of predictions of behavioral performance for different stimulus sizes (represented by the error bars in <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), so that for each model we could compute its range of predicted psychophysical suppression (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The predicted model suppression is the key metric that we are interested in, and its dependency on the key model parameters are explored in <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014 figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>."

We made the assumption of a factorial decoder (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), in which the read-out weight for each neuron only depends on the properties of that neuron itself, for two primary reasons: First, such a set of read-out weights can be learned easily since each weight only depends on the properties of the individual neuron itself (<a href=\"#bib35\">Law and Gold, 2009</a>), and second, it has recently received empirical support (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pitkow et al., 2015</a>). (We also performed our analysis using an optimal linear read-out, as well as one in which each neuron\u2019s weight depended only on its sensitivity to the stimulus and not its variability, and obtained qualitatively similar results \u2013 see Supplementary Information, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Since the stimulus size in our experiment is randomized, and since the duration is extremely brief (50 ms), we furthermore assume that the read-out is fixed and does not adjust dynamically to the stimulus size. We initially limited the read-out to neurons with receptive fields within 5\u00b0 of the stimulus center; we examine the impact of this choice below."

To understand the source of this suppression, we performed additional analyses in which key components of the model were removed: Specifically, we considered models in which (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zohary et al., 1994</a>) noise correlations were absent; (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>) correlations were as measured, but surround suppression was absent; and (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott and Dayan, 1999</a>) correlations and surround suppression were on average as measured, but the observed relationship between them (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) was missing. We found that both the noise correlation structure and surround suppression were necessary to account for the decreased performance as a function of size, since models (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zohary et al., 1994</a>) and (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>) did not show any psychophysical suppression at all (SI = 0; data not shown). However, these components together were not sufficient to account for the observed behavioral results, since model (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott and Dayan, 1999</a>) exhibited only modest psychophysical suppression (SI = 0.28; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,E</a> magenta).

Equally important is novel interaction between these two factors, wherein the correlation between neurons depends on their respective surround suppression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To arrive at these conclusions, we assumed that the animals used a fixed read-out, focusing on neurons with receptive fields near the center of the stimuli. To determine the importance of this assumption, we ran model simulations in which the integration radius was varied (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Unsurprisingly the SI decreased with increasing integration radius, dropping to 0.26 when the radius was 15\u00b0, which is significantly less than that exhibited psychophysically by the monkeys (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> green, Wilcoxon rank sum test, p&lt;0.001). The overall model performance, obtained by summing the performance across all sizes, was, however, unaffected by this parameter (ANOVA, <i>P</i> = 0.25). This is due to the fact that a larger integration radius increases the performance at large sizes, while decreasing the performance at small sizes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

We also find that the strength of noise correlations is related to the strength of signal correlations and that this relationship limits the benefit of increasing stimulus size on population coding. Moreover, we find that the correlation structure is not constant across MT neuron pairs, but rather is related to the strength of a seemingly unrelated variable, surround suppression. This relationship between signal correlations, noise correlations, and stimulus selectivity appears to have two important effects on visual perception: Large stimuli are encoded poorly because of a strong decrease in selectivity for surround-suppressed neurons, and undesirable noise correlations in non-suppressed neurons. Meanwhile small stimuli are encoded more effectively because of the combination of strong direction selectivity and advantageous correlation structure in surround-suppressed MT neurons. Below we suggest that this population size tuning might have important implications for perception and behavior."

The latter is particularly relevant, because attention increases the effective contrast of the stimulus (<a href=\"#bib60\">Treue and Trujillo, 1999</a>), which also increases surround suppression (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sundberg et al., 2009</a>) and decreases correlations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kohn and Smith, 2005</a>). Thus a single mechanism (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</a>) may account for the effects of attention and surround suppression on noise correlations, as implemented with divisive normalization (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tripp, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wiechert et al., 2010</a>). Attention is also of interest because, like surround suppression, it can increase or decrease the strength of noise correlations, depending on the stimulus encoding of the neuron pairs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ruff and Cohen, 2014</a>). These differential effects on positive and negative noise correlations are particularly important in MT, where negative correlations are quite common (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zohary et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Huang and Lisberger, 2009</a>). Negative correlations likely arise from motion-opponent mechanisms, in which the outputs of neurons with opposite direction tuning are subtracted. Such effects are stronger in MT than in V1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Qian and Andersen, 1994</a>), and they play an important role in decision-making models (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cohen and Newsome, 2009</a>)."

In a technical sense such a strategy is suboptimal (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beck et al., 2012</a>), as subjects could probably have performed better by making use of the neurons with receptive fields near the edges of the stimulus. Although we have no direct measure of the actual readout strategy used by the subjects, we suggest that the limited sampling used here is a more realistic model of the neural decision process, for several reasons. First, recall (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) that stimuli sizes were randomly interleaved, so that motion information was always present in central locations, but for peripheral locations it was only present for large stimuli. Previous work suggests that subjects allocate resources according to the uncertainty associated with individual stimulus positions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pelli, 1985</a>), so that monkeys in our task likely made greater use of neurons with receptive fields positioned near the center of the stimulus. In addition, although the subjects could have used neurons with receptive fields positioned near the edge of the stimulus to extract additional information about the motion of large stimuli (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tsui et al., 2010</a>), we found instead that choice probability decreased with receptive field eccentricity (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>; <i>r</i> = -0.48, <i>P</i> = 0.05). This suggests that the monkeys likely based their decisions on neurons with receptive fields closer to the center of the stimulus, where motion information was present reliably on every trial. It would therefore be interesting to study psychophysical suppression in a paradigm in which the stimulus location was unpredictable from trial to trial. We predict that psychophysical suppression would be reduced in this case, as would overall performance across sizes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Herrmann et al., 2010</a>)."

However, the TMS protocols used to modulate spatial suppression are inhibitory, and so one might just as easily interpret these results as an effect on noise correlations (<a href=\"#bib65\">Waterston and Pack, 2010</a>).

As a result, the pursuit initiation system might benefit from averaging the activity of many surround-supressed MT neurons.

Normalization in these models serves the function of computing a vector average of the MT population response, and it also affects the levels of noise correlations in a manner that accounts for trial-to-trial fluctuations in behavior. Our results suggest the additional function of reshaping the selectivity of the MT population response in such a way as to favor the motion of small stimuli, precisely as would be expected for a system that initiates orienting responses to moving objects in a natural environment (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lettvin et al., 1959</a>)."

This maps visual space in degrees into cortical space in millimeters. The integral of cortical space activation yields the cortical footprint (in square millimeters) as a function of stimulus size. The absolute number of neurons can then be obtained by multiplying the cortical footprint by a factor that indicates the number of neurons per millimeter. We set this factor to 20 neurons/mm<sup>2</sup>, which yielded a range of pool sizes comparable to those used in other studies (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The range ofpool sizes is in the regime where population sensitivity is saturated (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We verified that our results are robust with respect to this parameter re-running the simulations with a value of 40 neurons/mm<sup>2</sup>; the results were qualitatively similar to those reported here."

We then randomly sampled from this distribution to obtain DoE parameters that were subsequently converted to tuning curves. The variance, <i>V<sub>i</sub>(s,\u03b8)</i>, for each simulated neuron, was generated by multiplying the <i>S<sub>i</sub>(s,\u03b8)</i> with Fano factors randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution estimated from the measured Fano factors.

This spatial suppression is surprising because a larger stimulus would be expected to recruit more neurons and therefore provide more information for the perceptual decision. The authors demonstrate that monkeys also show this perceptual phenomenon. They characterize the responses of individual motion-sensitive neurons in area MT and show that, while these neurons demonstrate a wide range of surround suppression strengths, the suppression is, on average, much weaker than the one that is observed behaviorally. This rules out that the behavioral effect could simply be a consequence of an overall suppressed population response with increasing stimulus size. A choice probability analysis is used to demonstrate that neurons with stronger surround suppression do not make a larger contribution to the animals' choices. Using paired recordings, the authors further show that neurons with weak surround suppression, i.e., neurons that would, in principle, be beneficial for processing larger stimuli, are particularly affected by information-limiting noise correlations. As a consequence, the nervous system cannot benefit as much from pooling across these neurons when reading out the sensory information for the purpose of making a decision. Finally, assuming that the monkeys primarily relied on neurons with receptive fields close to the fovea (which is also supported by a choice probability analysis), the authors develop a computational model that is consistent with the behavioral and neural data and supports the idea that the suppression arises from three main factors: specific patterns of correlation among neurons in area MT, limiting the amount of information despite growing population size; surround suppression; and a readout mechanism that gives higher weight to central locations and \"ignores\" peripheral information."

Since the main purpose of the simulations is to match the distribution of the SIs to the psychophysical measurements, we avoided introducing this additional factor into our simulations."
