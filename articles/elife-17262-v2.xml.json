Here we report that analogous ring-like oligomers assemble from the C2AB domains of other Syt isoforms (Syt2, Syt7, Syt9) as well as related C2 domain containing protein, Doc2B and extended Synaptotagmins (E-Syts). Evidently, circular oligomerization is a general and conserved structural aspect of many C2 domain proteins, including Synaptotagmins. Further, using electron microscopy combined with targeted mutations, we show that under physiologically relevant conditions, both the Syt1 ring assembly and its rapid disruption by Ca<sup>2+</sup> involve the well-established functional surfaces on the C2B domain that are important for synaptic transmission. Our data suggests that ring formation may be triggered at an early step in synaptic vesicle docking and positions Syt1 to synchronize neurotransmitter release to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx."

Here we report that analogous ring-like oligomers assemble from the C2AB domains of other Syt isoforms (Syt2, Syt7, Syt9) as well as related C2 domain containing protein, Doc2B and extended Synaptotagmins (E-Syts). Evidently, circular oligomerization is a general and conserved structural aspect of many C2 domain proteins, including Synaptotagmins. Further, using electron microscopy combined with targeted mutations, we show that under physiologically relevant conditions, both the Syt1 ring assembly and its rapid disruption by Ca<sup>2+</sup> involve the well-established functional surfaces on the C2B domain that are important for synaptic transmission. Our data suggests that ring formation may be triggered at an early step in synaptic vesicle docking and positions Syt1 to synchronize neurotransmitter release to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx."

This involves maintaining a pool of synaptic vesicles (SV) containing neurotransmitters docked at the pre-synaptic membrane, ready to fuse and release their contents upon the influx of calcium\u00a0ions\u00a0(Ca<sup>2+</sup>)\u00a0following an action potential, while also preventing the spontaneous fusion of SVs in absence of the appropriate cue (<a href=\"#bib50\">S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">S\u00fcdhof, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rizo and Xu, 2015</a>). The core machinery required for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered neurotransmitter release are the SNARE proteins (VAMP2, Syntaxin, and SNAP25) as well as Munc13, Munc18, Complexin and Synaptotagmin (<a href=\"#bib50\">S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">S\u00fcdhof, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rizo and Xu, 2015</a>).

Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, the adjacent aliphatic surface loops on each of the C2 domains partially insert into the membrane and this enables the SNAREs to complete membrane fusion by mechanisms that are still uncertain (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tucker et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rhee et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hui et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Paddock et al., 2011</a>). Syt1 is also needed for the initial stage of close docking of SVs to the plasma membrane (PM), requiring in particular the interaction of the polybasic region on C2B domain with the anionic lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the PM (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Parisotto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Park et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lai et al., 2015</a>).

Deletion (or mutations) of Syt1 eliminates fast synchronous release and increases the normally small rate of asynchronous/spontaneous release (<a href=\"#bib13\">Geppert et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Littleton et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bacaj et al., 2013</a>). Reciprocally, removing Complexin increases the spontaneous release amount and the remaining Syt1 is only capable of mounting asynchronous release, though this release is still Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hobson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jorquera et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cho et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Trimbuch and Rosenmund, 2016</a>). This suggests that Syt1, acting in concert with Complexin, also functions as a clamp to both restrain and energize membrane fusion to permit rapid and synchronous release (<a href=\"#bib15\">Giraudo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>). How this clamping is accomplished still remains a mystery. In addition, fast neurotransmitter release exhibits a steep cooperative dependency on Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which implies that several Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions need to be bound to one or more Syt1 molecules to trigger release (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Matveev et al., 2011</a>). Further, reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity does not change this Ca<sup>2+</sup> cooperativity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Striegel et al., 2012</a>), suggesting multiple copies of Syt1 molecules might be involved in gating release. However, the exact mechanism of the cooperative triggering of SV fusion is unclear."

This finding suggests a simple and elegant mechanism: If these Syt1 ring-like oligomers were to form at the interface between SVs and the plasma membrane, they could act sterically to prevent fusion, until this barrier is removed when Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters and triggers ring disassembly i.e. the Syt1 ring would synchronize fusion to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. In\u00a0addition, the oligomeric nature of Syt1 could explain the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> cooperativity of neurotransmitter release. Here we show that the ring-like oligomer is a common structural feature of the C2 domain containing protein and describe the physiological correlates of the Syt1 ring oligomer which argues for a functional role for the Syt1 ring in orchestrating the synchronous neurotransmitter release."

To explore this further, we analyzed the organization of membrane bound C2AB domains of other neuronal isoforms of Synaptotagmin (Syt2, Syt7 and Syt9) on lipid surface under Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions by negative stain electron\u00a0microscopy\u00a0(EM). Syt2 and Syt9 act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for synchronous SV exocytosis\u00a0but are expressed in only\u00a0a subset of neurons (<a href=\"#bib61\">Xu et al., 2007</a>), while Syt7 has been posited to mediate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent asynchronous neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bacaj et al., 2013</a>). EM analysis on lipid monolayer was carried out as described previously (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Briefly, the lipid monolayer formed at the air/water interface was recovered on a carbon-coated EM grid and protein solution was added to the lipid monolayer under Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions (1\u2009mM EDTA) and incubated for 1\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Negative-stain analysis revealed the presence of ring-like oligomers for all the Syt isoforms tested (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Despite the variability in the number of ring-like structures between different isoforms, the size of the ring oligomers were\u00a0remarkably similar, with an average outer diameter of ~30 nm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In all cases, each ring was\u00a0composed of an outer protein band of a width of ~55\u00c5, which is consistent with the dimensions of a single C2AB domain (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fuson et al., 2007</a>). This data shows that the ability to form the circular oligomers is not unique to Syt1, but conserved among the Syt isoforms and further suggests that it might be an intrinsic property of the C2 domains."

All Syt isoforms and Doc2B were sensitive to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment and number of rings observed reduced drastically with Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment. *Note: With Syt2<sup>C2AB</sup>, we observed irregular patches of protein arrays together with circular structures following Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment. These circular structures were quite different from the Ca<sup>2+-</sup>free rings as they exhibit a more uniform protein density, indicating these are patches of protein arrays, arranged into round shape probably due to the local buckling of monolayer by insertion of Syt2 calcium loops. Over longer incubation time, the number of 'circular structure' decrease and the size of irregular patches increase and begin to pack orderly, suggesting the circular structure is the intermediate building block of 2D-array formation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition had divergent effect on the E-Syt isoforms, while the E-Syt2 was largely un-affected, the E-Syt1 rings were stabilized (discussed below).

Doc2B is a C2 domain protein expressed in the pre-synaptic terminals and a putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that regulates both spontaneous (<a href=\"#bib16\">Groffen et al., 2010</a>) and asynchronous release (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yao et al., 2011</a>). E-Syts are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins, which contain multiple C2 domains and have been implicated in ER-PM tethering, the formation of membrane contact sites, and in lipid transport and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<a href=\"#bib14\">Giordano et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Reinisch and De Camilli, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fernandez-Busnadiego, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Herdman and Moss, 2016</a>). Doc2B and E-Syt2 formed circular oligomeric structures on lipid monolayers analogous to those seen with Syt isoforms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). However, we observed very few and un-stable ring-like oligomers with E-Syt1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The lack of ring-like oligomers for E-Syt1 might be due to the insufficient concentration of this protein on the membrane surface as E-Syt1 has very weak affinity to the membrane under Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2015</a>)."

Consistent with this, we find that the\u00a0Syt1<sup>C2B</sup> domain alone can form the ring-like oligomers albeit a bit smaller in size, but the\u00a0Syt1<sup>C2A</sup> cannot (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Altogether, our data suggests that ring-like oligomers are a common structural feature of C2 domain containing proteins, but their sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> is divergent (discussed below in detail)."

A minimum of 35% PS in the monolayer and buffers containing &lt;50\u2009mM KCl were required to obtain stable ring structures (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). We reasoned that the inclusion of conserved N-terminal juxtamembrane region (~60 residues) that connects the C2AB domains to the membrane anchor, might help stabilize the ring oligomers.

Therefore, to identify which parts of Syt1 are involved in positioning the Syt1 on the membrane to promote the ring assembly, we focused on the conserved polybasic regions of Syt1.

However, PIP2 was essential to obtain stable Syt1<sup>CD</sup> ring oligomers when ATP at physiological concentrations (1\u2009mM Mg-ATP) was included (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C and E</a>). ATP is a critical co-factor, which modulates Syt1 function as it reverses the inactivating <i>cis-</i> interaction of Syt1 with its own membrane while preserving the functional <i>trans-</i> association to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib40\">Park et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vennekate et al., 2012</a>).

Corroborating this, 6% PIP2 as the sole anionic lipid (6% PIP2, 94% PC) in the lipid monolayer was found to be sufficient to form ring oligomers, even in the presence of 1\u2009mM ATP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and E</a>). Taken together, our data shows that under physiological ionic conditions, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent interaction of the C2B domain with PIP2 on the PM, which has been implicated in the vesicle docking both in vitro and in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib59\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Parisotto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Park et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lai et al., 2015</a>), is key to assembling the Syt1 ring-like oligomers."

Calcium ions at concentrations in the range measured in intra-terminal region\u00a0during synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</a>) fragmented and disassembled the rings in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). PIP2 had little or no effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the Syt1<sup>CD</sup> as we observed very similar reduction in Syt1<sup>CD</sup> rings with or without 3% PIP2 across all Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration tested (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To verify that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the Syt1<sup>CD</sup> rings is indeed due to specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Syt1 and to map this sensitivity, we generated and tested Syt1<sup>CD</sup> mutants that disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C2A and C2B domains respectively (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shao et al., 1996</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, disrupting Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to C2B (Syt1<sup>CD</sup> D309A, D363A, D365A; C2B<sup>3A</sup>) rendered the ring oligomers insensitive to calcium ions, while blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C2A domain (Syt1<sup>CD</sup> D178A, D230A, D232A; C2A<sup>3A</sup>) did not alter the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the Syt1<sup>CD</sup> rings (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Likewise, mutations of aliphatic loop residues in the C2B domain (Syt1<sup>CD</sup> V304N, Y364N, I367N; C2B<sup>3N</sup>), which insert into the membrane following Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, made the Syt1<sup>CD</sup> ring oligomers insensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> wash, but corresponding mutations in the C2A calcium loops (Syt1<sup>CD</sup> F231N, F234N, S235N; C2A<sup>3N</sup>) had no effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The mutation analysis shows that the rapid disruption of the Syt1 rings requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C2B and the subsequent reorientation of the C2B domain into the membrane. In other words,\u00a0the dissociation of the Syt1 ring oligomers is coupled to the conformational changes in C2B domain, which is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation and is physiologically required for triggering synaptic transmission."

The interaction of the conserved lysine residues in the\u00a0polybasic region of the C2B domain with PIP2 on the inner leaflet of the pre-synaptic plasma membrane is a key determinant in both ring assembly and in synaptic vesicle docking <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Martin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>), suggesting these processes are mechanistically linked. In addition, Syntaxin clusters PIP2 (by binding via its basic juxtamembrane region) and it has been suggested that it is these clusters that recruit the SVs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>). Given the high local concentration of both PIP2 (estimated to be up to ~80 mol% in such micro-domains [<a href=\"#bib19\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>]) and Syt1 (anchored in the synaptic vesicles), it is easy to imagine how the ring-like oligomers could form at the docking site in between the synaptic\u00a0vesicle and the PM. There are ~16\u201322 copies of Syt1 on a synaptic vesicle (<a href=\"#bib52\">Takamori et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wilhelm et al., 2014</a>), enough to form a ring oligomer of ~27\u201337 nm in diameter, assuming no contribution from the plasma membrane pool of Syt1. This is consistent with the Syt1 ring diameters\u00a0observed on the\u00a0lipid monolayers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure\u00a02B</a>). Several studies have shown that the Syt1-PIP2 docking interaction precedes the engagement of the v- with t-SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib55\">van den Bogaart et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Parisotto et al., 2012</a>). The prior formation of a Syt1 ring would\u00a0thus position it to ideally prevent the complete zippering of the SNAREs, in addition to acting as a washer (or spacer) to separate the two membranes. The height of the ring, ~4 nm (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2014</a>) would allow for the N-terminal domain of the SNARE complex to assemble, but such a gap would impede complete zippering. In effect, the Syt1 rings would block SNARE-mediated fusion and hold the SNARE in a pre-fusion half-zippered state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This is consistent with the earlier observation that docked vesicles appear to be 3\u20134 nm away from plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fernandez-Busnadiego et al., 2011</a>)."

In other words, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the ring oligomers requires the same C2 domain to have the capacity to bind both anionic lipids and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is true for the C2AB domains of the Syt isoforms and Doc2B and hence, these ring oligomers are Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, in the case of the E-Syts, the C-terminal C2 domains (C2E for E-Syt1 and C2C in E-Syt1) that are involved in anionic lipid dependent membrane tethering (thereby the ring formation) lack the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loops, with the N-terminal C2 domains mediating the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane interaction (<a href=\"#bib14\">Giordano et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Reinisch and De Camilli, 2016</a>). Hence, the E-Syt rings are insensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Further, E-Syt1 exhibits very weak membrane binding under Ca<sup>2+</sup> free conditions, which is enhanced upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (<a href=\"#bib22\">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2015</a>). The increased surface concentration of the E-Syt1 in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> could explain the improvement in the number of E-Syt1 rings observed under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Particularly interesting are the E-Syts, which function to enable the ER and plasma membrane to come into intimate contact \u2013 close enough for lipids to be transferred. Our results suggest this might be achieved by bridging two membranes with an intervening structure, most probably based on ring oligomers. Such an organization could stabilize the contact sites and also enhance the lipid transfer function of E-Syts. However, more research is required to understand this better. Interestingly, yeast cells have both E-Syts (for membrane adhesion) and SNAREs (for membrane fusion) but do not contain vesicle-associated Syt protein and do not carry out calcium-regulated exocytosis. Perhaps this set the stage for exocytosis to evolve when the C2 domains combined with a vesicle-associated protein to form ring-like oligomer i.e. washers that reversibly impeded SNAREpins."

The surface of the droplet was coated with 0.5\u2009\u03bcl of phospholipid mixture (0.5\u2009mM total lipids). The lipid mixtures, DOPC/DOPS &amp; DOPPC/DOPS/PIP2 were pre-mixed as required, dried under N<sub>2</sub> gas and then re-suspended in chloroform to the requisite concentration before adding to the water droplet. The Teflon block then was sealed in a humidity chamber for 1\u00a0hr at room temperature to allow the chloroform to evaporate. Continuous carbon-coated EM grids (400 mesh; Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA ) were baked at 70\u00b0C for 1\u2009hr and washed with hexane to improve hydrophobicity. Lipid monolayers formed at the air/water interface were then recovered by placing the pre-treated EM grid carbon side down on top of each water droplet for 1\u2009min. The grid was raised above the surface of the Teflon block by injecting ultrapure H<sub>2</sub>O into the side port and then was lifted off the droplet immediately."

The final KCl concentration in the buffer were adjusted to 100\u2009mM or 140\u2009mM as required. To facilitate structural analysis of the rings, we further optimized the incubation conditions by using an annealing procedure: Rings were nucleated at 37\u00b0C for 1\u2009min followed by a 30-min annealing step at 4\u00b0C. The grids were rinsed briefly (\u223c10\u2009s) with incubation buffer alone or with buffer supplemented with CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.1, 0.5 and 1\u2009mM free) for Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment studies. The free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was calculated by Maxchelator (maxchelator.stanford. edu). Subsequently, the grids were blotted with Whatman#1 filter paper (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), negatively stained with uranyl acetate solution (1% wt/vol), and air dried. The negatively stained specimens were examined on a FEI Tecani T12 operated at 120 kV. The defocus range used for our data was 0.6\u20132.0\u2009\u03bcm. Images were recorded under low-dose conditions (\u223c20 e\u2212/\u00c52) on a 4K \u00d7 4K CCD camera (UltraScan 4000; Gatan, Inc.,\u00a0Pleasanton,\u00a0CA), at a nominal magnification of 42,000\u00d7. Micrographs were binned by a factor of 2 at a final sampling of 5.6\u2009\u00c5 per pixel on the object scale. The image analysis, including size distribution measurements was carried out using ImageJ software."

However, it is unclear whether the C2 domain could self-assemble to oligomers in solution (i.e. in the absence of membrane), especially for Syt1<sup>CD</sup> (residues 82-421).

A synaptic vesicle contains ~16-22 copies of Syt1 molecules (Takamoriet al. 2006, Wilhelmet al. 2014), enough to form a ring oligomer of ~27 -37 nm in diameter, consistent with our EM analysis.
