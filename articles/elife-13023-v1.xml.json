We show that the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>] is required in neurons and in OLs for normal CNS myelination. In mice, mutations of <i>Fig4, Pikfyve</i> or <i>Vac14</i>, encoding key components of the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosynthetic complex, each lead to impaired OL maturation, severe CNS hypomyelination and delayed propagation of compound action potentials. Primary OLs deficient in <i>Fig4</i> accumulate large LAMP1<sup>+</sup> and Rab7<sup>+</sup> vesicular structures and exhibit reduced membrane sheet expansion. PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> deficiency leads to accumulation of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) in LAMP1<sup>+</sup> perinuclear vesicles that fail to migrate to the nascent myelin sheet. Live-cell imaging of OLs after genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis revealed impaired trafficking of plasma membrane-derived MAG through the endolysosomal system in primary cells and brain tissue. Collectively, our studies identify PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> as a key regulator of myelin membrane trafficking and myelinogenesis."
