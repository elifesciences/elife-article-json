Here we show that genome-wide accumulation of H3K9me2 is crucial for postimplantation development, and coincides with redistribution of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-dependent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Loss of G9a or EZH2 results in upregulation of distinct gene sets involved in cell cycle regulation, germline development and embryogenesis. Notably, the H3K9me2 modification extends to active enhancer elements where it promotes developmentally-linked gene silencing and directly marks promoters and gene bodies. This epigenetic mechanism is important for priming gene regulatory networks for critical cell fate decisions in rapidly proliferating postimplantation epiblast cells."

Here we show that genome-wide accumulation of H3K9me2 is crucial for postimplantation development, and coincides with redistribution of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-dependent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Loss of G9a or EZH2 results in upregulation of distinct gene sets involved in cell cycle regulation, germline development and embryogenesis. Notably, the H3K9me2 modification extends to active enhancer elements where it promotes developmentally-linked gene silencing and directly marks promoters and gene bodies. This epigenetic mechanism is important for priming gene regulatory networks for critical cell fate decisions in rapidly proliferating postimplantation epiblast cells."

The genes within the genome encode for all the proteins, but specific genes are selected to be active at the appropriate time. For this reason, there are mechanisms that can turn the genes on and off as and when required. One such mechanism is called methylation, in which a chemical group called a methyl tag is added to either the DNA or to histone proteins. DNA wraps around histone proteins to form a structure called chromatin. When histones are tagged with a methyl group, they become closely packed, and the resulting compaction of the chromatin around a gene inactivates that gene. For gene activation, the methyl tag is replaced by another tag called acetyl, which allows the chromatin to de-compact and become more accessible."

Similarly, embryos that lacked the EZH2 enzyme experienced the early and inappropriate activation of a different set of developmentally important genes. In addition, switches called enhancers control gene expression, and Zylicz et al. found that these regulators are also turned off by histone modifications made by the G9a enzyme. Thus, these findings provide important insights on how genes are regulated during a critical period of mouse development, when cells prepare to acquire their specific identities. This should lead to further work on the role of G9a in the hours after fertilisation; that is before the \u2018programming\u2019 events described here."

Subsequent development of the ICM leads to the formation of primed postimplantation epiblast cells by E5.5\u20136.25, which are poised to initiate lineage-specification.

Genome-wide DNA demethylation after fertilisation leads to an epigenetic basal state with low 5meC in ICM of blastocysts. Shortly after implantation, the epiblast cells undergo epigenetic programming, which includes de novo DNA methylation. By E6.25, the epiblast is primed for somatic development, while being competent for germline specification. Gastrulation follows at E6.75. Na\u00efve ESCs, primed EpiLCs and EpiSCs represent different stages of in vivo\u00a0development. ESCs grown in 2i/LIF medium resemble the ICM, while EpiLCs, induced from ESCs after 48\u00a0h in response to FGF2 and Activin A, are equivalent to epiblast.

We found that during the formation of postimplantation epiblast, there is a dramatic increase in H3K9me2 levels and a concomitant H3K27me3 redistribution. These events are necessary for repression of a distinct set of genes, including regulators of the germline, cell cycle, apoptosis, and development. The rapid acquisition of H3K9me2 extends to key enhancer elements, thereby reinforcing their repression. We propose that such epigenetic programming of epiblast primes a specific gene regulatory network, which is a necessary prerequisite for embryogenesis."

                                "text": "First, we investigated the dynamics of epigenetic programming of repressive H3K9me2 during early mouse development. Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of E3.5 and E5.5 embryos revealed significant enrichment of H3K9me2 in the epiblast of postimplantation embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,E</a>). Accumulation of this modification, which is dependent on G9a and its binding partner G9a-like protein (GLP), coincides with increased levels of the enzymes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D,F,G</a>). To address the function of H3K9me2, we examined the consequences of <i>Ehmt2</i> deletion (<i>Ehmt2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>). Loss of G9a by E6.5 resulted in reduced levels of H3K9me2 modification, and an increase in apoptotic and non-proliferative cells as judged by IF staining for cleaved Caspase 3 and Ki67, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,C,D</a>). These changes led to a developmental delay of mutant embryos by E7.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tachibana et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yamamizu et al., 2012</a>)."

This revealed misregulation of 180 genes, of which 147 (~82%) are upregulated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) (Log2[fold change[FC]]&gt;1.4, p-value&lt;0.05). Among the upregulated genes, ~27% of them were located on the X chromosome (p-value=1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-15</sup>), notably in clusters of <i>Xlr, Rhox</i> and <i>Mage-a</i> genes. Consistent with the known functions of these clusters, we found significant enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms linked to hematopoiesis, sexual reproduction, and regulation cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). To validate these findings, we analysed individual E6.25 epiblast cells by single cell real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). A significant proportion of <i>Ehmt2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>cells showed upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <i>Cdnkn1a</i>, and late germline markers <i>Asz1</i> and <i>Rhox5</i> but not <i>Pou5f1</i> (coding for OCT4) or <i>Nanog</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). This indicates that, contrary to a previous report (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yamamizu et al., 2012</a>), the phenotypic effects cannot be attributed to a delayed exit from na\u00efve pluripotency. Furthermore, loss of G9a did not abrogate the establishment of a population of primordial germ cells (PGCs), as judged by the expression of AP2\u03b3 and OCT4, key germline regulators (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). These observations show that G9a promotes growth of the embryo by repressing apoptotic and late germline genes, but it does not affect the exit from na\u00efve pluripotency and establishment of the PGC lineage."

For this reason, we performed RNA-seq on individual E6.25 epiblasts lacking EZH2 (<i>Ezh2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>). We found upregulation of 165, and downregulation of 24 transcripts (Log2(FC)&gt;1.4, p-value&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 3</a>), among which were homeobox and gastrulation-related genes, including <i>Hoxd13</i> and <i>Lefty2</i>, but pluripotency regulators such as <i>Nanog</i> and <i>Pou5f1</i> were not affected (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B,C</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 4</a>). Importantly, we only found five significantly upregulated genes that were shared between <i>Ehmt2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> and <i>Ezh2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> embryos. Thus, G9a and EZH2 appear to stabilise silencing of distinct sets of germline, proliferation and developmental regulators, but neither of them has an effect on the pluripotency transcription programme in postimplantation embryos."

For this purpose, we optimised a low cell number chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (lcChIP-seq) protocol to analyse ~25,000 pregastrulation E6.25 epiblast cells in two biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>)(<a href=\"#bib34\">Ng, et al., 2013</a>).\u00a0We intersected this information with our RNA-seq data and with the published whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBSeq) datasets (<a href=\"#bib47\">Seisenberger et al., 2012</a>).

This is also the case in ESCs cultured in conventional media with serum (sESC) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lienert et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wen et al., 2009</a>). By contrast, na\u00efve ESCs grown in 2i/LIF (2i/LIF ESCs) show spreading of H3K27me3 outside the CpG dense loci (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marks et al., 2012</a>). Thus, there is redistribution of H3K27me3 in E6.25 epiblast, relative to both na\u00efve ESCs and possibly ICM in vivo. The association of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 modifications on promoters is mutually exclusive, since only 0.3% of them are enriched for both marks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, anticorrelation with Chi<sup>2</sup> p-value=0.0024). These differences are in line with H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 being linked to high and low 5-methylcytosine (5meC) levels, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Nonetheless, despite marking distinct chromatin regions, both H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 are linked to transcriptional repression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Notably, this gene repression is correlated with histone modification enrichment at promoters as well as in gene bodies. The H3K9me2 modification in gene bodies could impede transcriptional elongation, splicing, or activity of regulatory elements (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allo et al., 2009</a>). Our evidence suggests that H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 modifications in vivo\u00a0are linked to distinct repressive chromatin states. We confirmed this by means of self-organizing maps, which cluster promoters and gene bodies based on similarity of their cumulative epigenetic signature with respect to transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)(<a href=\"#bib59\">Wehrens and Buydens, 2007</a>)."

First, we identified genes that become robustly activated or repressed in E6.25 epiblasts relative to ICM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)\u00a0(Log2(RPKM)&lt;4, p-value&lt;0.05, Log2(FC)&gt;1). These genes generally corresponded to the expected developmental progression. For example, the transcripts that become silenced by the postimplantation stage (E6.25) are enriched for GO terms such as \u2018blastocyst formation\u2019 and \u2018STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) signalling regulation\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). These repressed genes are generally enriched for H3K9me2 or H3K27me3, especially when they have high or intermediate CpG density, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Moreover, consistent with global DNA hypomethylation of the ICM, there is transient expression of 5meC-sensitive germline genes at E3.5 that are subsequently repressed by E6.25. On the other hand, genes activated in E6.25 epiblast include \u2018neural tube\u2019 and \u2018polarized epithelium\u2019 genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Finally, both activated and repressed genes are enriched for regulators of transcription, embryonic development and metabolic processes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This analysis reveals that the transcriptional changes between the na\u00efve state associated with the ICM, and the primed state of postimplantation epiblast in vivo reflect the dramatic alterations in signalling, morphology, and metabolism occurring during development."

On the other hand, meiotic genes and those involved in immune responses were more likely targeted by H3K9me2.

To investigate this, we directly compared the epigenetic states of E6.25 epiblast and EpiSCs. Global and metagene analysis revealed little differences in the distribution of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 between E6.25 epiblast and EpiSCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Similarly, over 97% of genes marked by H3K9me2 showed enrichment in both cell types (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). On the other hand, H3K27me3 underwent a significant rearrangement in EpiSCs when compared with in vivo epiblast cells, with genes regulating meiosis and bone development preferentially losing H3K27me3 at promoters (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F,H</a>). We reasoned that this might be associated with DNA hypermethylation of such elements since H3K27me3 mark is anti-correlated with 5meC (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Indeed, our whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBSeq) of EpiSCs revealed a ~10% increase in global DNA methylation levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). More specifically, promoters that had lost H3K27me3 acquired significantly more 5meC in EpiSCs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This observation indicates that EpiSC derivation leads to an aberrant epigenetic state, especially at germline promoters. Such stable silencing of these genes might contribute to a reduced competence of EpiSC for PGC fate."

Thus, the epigenetic programming of epiblast cells by G9a and EZH2 appears to directly regulate silencing at only a limited set of genes, possibly owing to redundant epigenetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, we found that ~63% of genes upregulated in <i>Ezh2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>\u00a0and ~36% in <i>Ehmt2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>\u00a0show enrichment for H3K27me3 and H3K9me2, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>,<a href=\"#SD6-data\">2</a>).

                                "text": "We next investigated the role of G9a in regulating transposable elements (TEs) as previous studies have shown that loss of G9a in sESC leads to aberrant expression of murine\u00a0endogenous retroviruses with leucine tRNA primer\u00a0(MERV-L)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Maksakova et al., 2013</a>). To this end, we combined our lcChIP-seq and RNA-seq from E6.25 epiblast and mapped only unique reads to all mouse repeat loci with sufficient coverage. We found that ~15% (4.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup>/3.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup>) and ~18% (4.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup>/2.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup>) of repeats show significant H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 enrichment, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). On the other hand, only ~0.11% (3636/3.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup>) and ~0.06% (1646/2.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup>) of all repeats were significantly upregulated in <i>Ehmt2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> and <i>Ezh2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> epiblast, respectively. By intersecting fractions of upregulated and epigenetically marked loci in each subfamily, we identified repeats that are enriched for and regulated by H3K9me2 or H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013F</a>). Direct targets for EZH2 are limited and exhibited no subfamily trend. However, 13/15 subfamilies repressed by G9a are notable as they correspond to endogenous retroviral elements (ERV), especially ERV-L and ERV-LMaLR (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Consistent with the RNA-seq analysis, single cell RT-qPCR from individual E6.25 <i>Ehmt2<sup>+/+</sup></i> or <i>Ehmt2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>\u00a0epiblast cells showed upregulation of mouse transposon D (MTD), mouse transposable element b (MTEb\u00a0)\u00a0and Lx8 but not of IAP repeat elements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). To confirm G9a-dependent deposition of H3K9me2 at these transposons, we used an in vitro model. We generated two <i>Ehmt2<sup>F/</sup></i><sup>\u2212</sup> ESC lines expressing a tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible Cre recombinase\u00a0(CreER), which were cultured in 2i/LIF medium. Following TAM treatment, day 2 EpiLCs were used for lcChIP-qPCR, which showed significant depletion of H3K9me2 upon loss of G9a at\u00a0MTEb and Lx8 loci, but not IAP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Thus, G9a deposits H3K9me2 at some repeat elements in postimplantation epiblast, where it is necessary to repress TEs that predominantly belong to the ERVs class. This implies a potentially important role for G9a in maintaining genomic integrity."

We generated high quality native ChIP-seq datasets for H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 from 2i/LIF ESCs, EpiLCs and EpiSCs. Enhancers in these pluripotent cells have recently been identified based on enrichment of p300, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (<i>GSE56138, GSE57409</i>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buecker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Factor et al., 2014</a>). Consistent with programming of epiblast in vivo by H3K9me2 modification (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), we found genome-wide accumulation of H3K9me2 in primed pluripotent cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As H3K9me2 ChIP-seq measures only the relative enrichment, we have scaled it to indicate absolute quantities of histone modification. Our analysis revealed increased enrichment of H3K9me2 at genes upon exit from na\u00efve pluripotency (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This effect extends to many enhancers but significant H3K9me2 enrichment is observed at elements, which show DNA hypermethylation and cluster separately from poised H3K27me3-enriched elements (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). As with H3K27me3 modification, H3K9me2 is not a distinct enhancer mark, but rather is associated with larger domains within which regulatory elements reside (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Interestingly, of all the enhancers that are active in 2i/LIF ESCs (p300, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enrichment), ~12% (3884) gain H3K9me2 after 2 days of induction towards EpiLCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), while only 3% (1117) become enriched for H3K27me3. Such elements are also enriched for H3K9me2 in E6.25 epiblast (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To validate these findings, we performed lcChIP-qPCR from ethanol or TAM treated <i>Ehmt2<sup>F/\u2212</sup></i> EpiLCs expressing CreER. We confirmed that previously identified enhancer elements gain H3K9me2 in a G9a-dependent manner but active or H3K27me3 poised elements do not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Thus, acquisition of H3K9me2 occurs at distal regulatory elements, perhaps to direct or reinforce their inactivation."

Consistently, enhancer classification based on their epigenetic state has shown that ~57% (2212) of H3K9me2-enriched enhancers in EpiLCs still retain significant H3K27ac (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which we further confirmed using lcChIP-qPCR (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). To exclude possible effects of cell population heterogeneity, we performed sequential ChIP-qPCR, which showed dual H3K9me2 and H3K27ac enrichment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Such transient dual marking might indicate their continued responsiveness to signalling cues. In addition, H3K9me2-enriched elements showed no change in the active H3K27ac modification in EpiLCs lacking G9a (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Taken together, our findings show that the repressive H3K9me2 and activating H3K27ac modifications transiently co-occur at enhancers during epiblast priming."

Therefore, we determined the correlation between H3K9me2 enrichment and enhancer activity by analysing the expression levels of enhancer RNAs (eRNA), which is a hallmark of active enhancers (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). We performed RT-qPCR for candidate robustly expressed eRNAs originating from regions enriched for H3K9me2 or H3K27me3. Upon EpiLC induction, such elements underwent robust transcriptional inactivation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). This is not a global effect because enhancers for genes, such as <i>Otx2</i> that are linked with primed pluripotency, show increased eRNA expression in EpiLCs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Thus, upon blastocyst implantation, H3K9me2 domains extend to active enhancers targeted for initiation of silencing, which accounts for the co-enrichment with H3K27ac."

This was specific to H3K9me2, since the H3K27me3-enriched and active regulatory elements were unaffected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Finally, we sought to validate our findings in vivo since multiple enhancer elements showed increased levels of H3K9me2 in the post-implantation epiblast. To this end, we isolated RNA from individual <i>Ehmt2<sup>+/+</sup></i> and <i>Ehmt2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>\u00a0E6.25 epiblasts. After complementary DNA (cDNA) preamplification, we measured eRNA expression in these samples. We were able to detect 7/8 eRNAs associated with H3K9me2 marked enhancers, and 4 of these showed significant increase in expression in <i>Ehmt2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>embryos (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Of all four control eRNAs detected in vivo, none showed altered expression.

Once acquired, H3K9me2 represses a specific subset of genes, including key regulators of proliferation and germline development. The enrichment of H3K9me2 additionally extends into domains that contain multiple enhancer elements, leading to their developmentally-linked inactivation. This uncovers an important role for G9a in setting the regulatory circuitry in the epiblast that enables the subsequent developmental programme to unfold."

While both G9a and PRC2 are involved in this epigenetic programming process, we found limited overlap between H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 targets or, indeed, between genes that were upregulated in <i>Ezh2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>and <i>Ehmt2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>mutant embryos. This indicates that they likely have independent functions, as observed in sESC, which is unrelated to the previously reported G9a-dependent recruitment of PRC2 complex (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lienert et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mozzetta et al., 2013</a>). Thus, prior to gastrulation, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 generate distinct repressive chromatin states, linked to DNA hyper- and hypomethylation, respectively. These modifications therefore act as complementary systems to target specific regulatory pathways, ensuring that they become repressed during the exit from na\u00efve pluripotency. Following PGC specification, however, there is germline-specific resetting of the epigenome, including the erasure of H3K9me2 and DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hajkova et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Seki et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">2007</a>), which allows for the expression of germline-specific genes that have been silenced by these epigenetic modifications."

It is noteworthy that the two cell types show highly similar distribution of H3K9me2, but EpiSCs globally gain DNA methylation and lose H3K27me3 from germline-related genes, which might contribute to the reduced competence of EpiSCs towards PGCs. Indeed, stable promoter DNA methylation has been previously reported for two germline genes, <i>Stella</i> and <i>Rex1</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hayashi and Surani, 2009</a>).

We additionally reveal that G9a is involved in the rapid switching of epigenetic states at regulatory elements by depositing H3K9me2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The accumulation of H3K9me2 at enhancers is mostly linked with transcriptional repression, although they transiently retain significant levels of H3K27ac. Thus, we show uncoupling of histone acetylation from the transcriptional state, which indicates that loss of an active epigenetic signature is often secondary to enhancer inactivation. Such contrasting epigenetic marks at enhancers might confer responsiveness and plasticity of cells to signalling cues. This coincides with the rapidly unfolding developmental programme in postimplantation epiblast, resulting in potential for diverse cell fate decisions. In line with this role, the loss of H3K9me2, as seen at an oestrogen-induced enhancer in breast cancer cells, promotes reactivation of the apoptosis regulator <i>bcl2</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Perillo et al., 2008</a>)."

After training, each node on the hexagonal map represented a set of promoters or gene bodies with very similar epigenetic signatures and transcriptional states. The figures show the average epigenetic modifications and expression levels for the genomic regions summarized in each node. Neighbouring nodes on the map also contain genomic regions with similar signatures and expression levels as a result of an update function, which adjusts close neighbours with decreasing distance during training."

The reviewers suspect that this may be an indirect consequence of either increased accessibility at enhancers associated with loss of H3K9me2 (which would be an interesting phenotype supporting role of G9a in enhancer repression) or simply of an increased cellular stress resulting in increase in p53 stability (perhaps less interesting). If combined with some accessibility data and eRNA expression analysis at matching enhancers (none of the enhancers at which eRNAs were analysed corresponds to the p53-bound enhancers from <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), the p53 ChIP result could be used to strengthen the conclusions on the role of G9a in regulating enhancer function \u2013 which currently needs further work."

The authors generated embryos deficient for G9a or Ezh2 methyltransferases and examined their gene expression profile using single epiblast RNA-seq at day E6.25, prior to the overt phenotypic manifestations. To determine which genomic loci are marked by repressive histone methylation marks in vivo, the authors performed low cell number ChIP-seq assays for H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 in E6.25 epiblasts. Strikingly, for either mark, an exceedingly small subset of marked genes is perturbed upon loss of respective enzyme, suggesting either existence of multiple redundant silencing mechanisms or these methylation events being a secondary consequence of repression. Furthermore, the set of genes that are aberrantly upregulated are non-overlapping between the two different knock outs and show therefore that in the epiblast H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 are involved in repression of different set of genes. The authors note that many intergenic enhancer regions are marked by H3K9me2 in the epiblast, and they follow up upon these observations using the in vitro cellular models.

The reviewers suspect that this may be an indirect consequence of either increased accessibility at enhancers associated with loss of H3K9me2 (which would be an interesting phenotype supporting role of G9a in enhancer repression) or simply of an increased cellular stress resulting in increase in p53 stability (perhaps less interesting). If combined with some accessibility data and eRNA expression analysis at matching enhancers (none of the enhancers at which eRNAs were analysed corresponds to the p53-bound enhancers from <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), the p53 ChIP result could be used to strengthen the conclusions on the role of G9a in regulating enhancer function \u2013 which currently needs further work.</i> "

We show H3K9me2 accumulation, H3K27ac enrichment, sequential ChIPqPCR and eRNA misexpression in G9a mutant cells in vitro and in vivo. The strength of this comprehensive analysis is that it looks directly at the epigenetic and transcriptional state of enhancers rather than relying on a possible erroneous assumption that enhancers regulate the nearest genes.

We also provide comparison between in vivo epiblast and EpiSCs on the epigenetic level.

Nevertheless we performed DNAseI-qPCR hypersensitivity assay to address potential increased accessibility of the loci (<a href=\"#fig14\">Author response image 5</a>). However we did not observe changes at enhancers with increased eRNA expression in G9aKO EpiLCs. This result is in line with a lack of change to the H3K27ac at these loci (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7 D</a>). This further indicates that there is some level of uncoupling between enhancer activity and its accessibility during the dynamic process of inactivation."

What are the major similarities and differences in patterns? A systematic (and to whatever extent possible, quantitative) comparison of H3K9me2 patterns across the genome in different cellular states would not only be broadly interesting for the community, but also relevant for the authors' own conclusions.</i>"

This includes the results from lcChIPseq for H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 modifications as well as WGBSeq dataset. Both cell types have strikingly similar distribution of H3K9me2 showing that accumulation of this modification occurs rapidly and efficiently both in vivo an in vitro. On the other hand, there is substantial redistribution of H3K27me3 during EpiSC derivation including loss of this modification from multiple promoters of germline regulators. We also show that self-renewing EpiSCs accumulate substantial levels of DNA methylation especially at regions where the polycomb mark is lost. This explains, at least in part, reduced developmental potential of EpiSCs for the germline fate due to stable epigenetic silencing of PGC genes."
