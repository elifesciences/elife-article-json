Breathing-related interneurons of the brainstem pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC) that putatively comprise the core respiratory rhythm generator in mammals are derived from <i>Dbx1</i>-expressing precursors. Here, we show that selective photonic destruction of Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons in neonatal mouse slices impairs respiratory rhythm but surprisingly also the magnitude of motor output; respiratory hypoglossal nerve discharge decreased and its frequency steadily diminished until rhythm stopped irreversibly after 85\u00b120 (mean \u00b1 SEM) cellular ablations, which corresponds to \u223c15% of the estimated population. These results demonstrate that a single canonical interneuron class generates respiratory rhythm and contributes in a premotor capacity, whereas these functions are normally attributed to discrete populations. We also establish quantitative cellular parameters that govern network viability, which may have ramifications for respiratory pathology in disease states."

Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random directed graphs G(<i>n,</i>p) were populated with Rubin-Hayes preB\u00f6tC neuron models at each node, and their links were described by excitatory synapses, as described for <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> above. In numerical simulations, the resulting network models with very high probability of generating rhythm and respiratory-like cycle period (\u223c4 s, indicated by asterisks in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were subjected to piecewise cumulative ablation protocols like slice experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2\u20134</a>). The parameters describing the model networks (number of neurons <i>n</i> and synaptic connection probability p) are listed below in columns 1 and 2. Each ablation experiment was simulated five or more times. The maximum period (in s) and cumulative ablation tally (unitless) required to stop the rhythm are listed in the table for each individual realization of the network model along with average values for these characteristic measures. The networks deemed to be most representative of the preB\u00f6tC, i.e., (<i>n,</i>p) = (320, 0.1375), (330, 0.125), (340, 0.125) were simulated 16 times each.",

Here the networks are Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi static directed random graphs G(<i>n,</i>p) (as in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014supplement 1</a>); that is, the nodes are not populated with dynamical models and the interconnections between nodes are simply static directed links (rather than dynamical synapses). Each network (static graph) below was subjected to 100 random deletions. During the ablation sequence, we computed the following global network metrics: K-core, the number of strongly connected components (SCC), and local network metrics: local cluster coefficient, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. The initial (first) and final (last) values for the global and local measures are plotted side by side in the appropriate columns below. We also computed the initial in- and out-degree (i.e., the average number of directed connections in and out), percentage drop in the final average in-degree, and the percentage-drop of the final average out-degree. The \u2018Ave.\u2019 row reports average change (in percent) for K-core, SCC, cluster coefficient, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality, as well as the average in- and out-degree for initial and final states of the network. Definitions for the characteristic measures are elaborated in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019.",

Breathing-related interneurons of the brainstem pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC) that putatively comprise the core respiratory rhythm generator in mammals are derived from <i>Dbx1</i>-expressing precursors. Here, we show that selective photonic destruction of Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons in neonatal mouse slices impairs respiratory rhythm but surprisingly also the magnitude of motor output; respiratory hypoglossal nerve discharge decreased and its frequency steadily diminished until rhythm stopped irreversibly after 85\u00b120 (mean \u00b1 SEM) cellular ablations, which corresponds to \u223c15% of the estimated population. These results demonstrate that a single canonical interneuron class generates respiratory rhythm and contributes in a premotor capacity, whereas these functions are normally attributed to discrete populations. We also establish quantitative cellular parameters that govern network viability, which may have ramifications for respiratory pathology in disease states."

These rhythms persist in reduced slice preparations that retain the preB\u00f6tC and can be monitored via respiratory hypoglossal (XII) nerve discharge, providing a powerful in vitro model of breathing behavior (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lieske et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Koizumi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Funk and Greer, 2013</a>). Rhythmogenic preB\u00f6tC interneurons are distinguished by glutamatergic transmitter phenotype or the expression of neuropeptides and peptide receptors, or their intersection (<a href=\"#bib17\">Funk et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gray et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Guyenet et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stornetta et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wall\u00e9n-Mackenzie et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tan et al., 2008</a>). Glutamatergic, peptidergic, and peptide receptor-expressing preB\u00f6tC interneurons develop from a common set of precursors that express the homeobox gene <i>Dbx1</i> during embryonic development. <i>Dbx1</i>-derived interneurons (hereafter Dbx1 neurons) in perinatal mice are inspiratory modulated, and <i>Dbx1</i>-null mice die at birth without ever breathing (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouvier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gray et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Picardo et al., 2013</a>).

The destruction of \u223c120 rhythmic neurons irreversibly stopped respiratory rhythmogenesis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hayes et al., 2012</a>). However, inspiratory-modulated preB\u00f6tC neurons may be excitatory or inhibitory. Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence changes cannot differentiate rhythmogenic glutamatergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Funk et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wall\u00e9n-Mackenzie et al., 2006</a>) from GABA- or glycinergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kuwana et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Winter et al., 2009</a>), which influence sensory integration and coordinated patterns of muscle contraction for respiratory behaviors, but are non-rhythmogenic because inspiratory rhythms in vivo and in vitro do not require synaptic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib13\">Feldman and Smith, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brockhaus and Ballanyi, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kuwana et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ren and Greer, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fujii et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Janczewski et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, we predicted that the selective destruction of Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons, which are predominantly glutamatergic (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouvier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gray et al., 2010</a>)\u2014unlike locomotor Dbx1 neurons in lumbar spinal cord of which \u223c70% express inhibitory transmitters (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lanuza et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Talpalar et al., 2013</a>)\u2014would impair rhythmogenesis with a cell-ablation tally much lower than 120 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hayes et al., 2012</a>). To test this prediction of the Dbx1 core hypothesis, we used photonics to map the positions of Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons, and then laser ablated them\u2014one cell at a time\u2014while continuously monitoring respiratory motor output (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). As predicted, cumulative destruction of Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons progressively decreased respiratory frequency until rhythm ceased after ablation of \u223c85 neurons. Surprisingly, cumulative Dbx1 cellular ablations also diminished the amplitude of respiratory XII nerve discharge, suggesting that Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons also influence motor output. In simulations that assign only rhythm-generating function to preB\u00f6tC neurons, cumulative ablations decreased frequency and stopped rhythmogenesis but at much lower tallies and without perturbing the output amplitude. These ablation results and model-experiment discrepancies, combined with antidromic activation from the XII nucleus and axonal projection patterns, ascribe rhythm-generating and premotor roles to Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons. Thus, we demonstrate that one cardinal class of hindbrain interneurons serves two distinct roles in a key mammalian CPG; the data further establish quantitative cellular parameters that minimally ensure network functionality."

We used a <i>Dbx1</i> Cre-driver line (<i>Dbx1</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup>) coupled with floxed reporter mice (<i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</i><sup><i>flox-stop-tdTomato</i></sup>) to locate Dbx1 neurons via fluorescence. Viewed in the transverse plane of slices that expose the preB\u00f6tC at their surface (i.e., preB\u00f6tC-surface slices), Dbx1 neurons form a bilaterally symmetrical V-shape starting dorsally at the border of the XII motor nuclei and continuing ventrolaterally to the preB\u00f6tC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Red ROIs are deemed valid targets by the circularity test, which evaluates somatic shape; blue ROIs that fail the circularity test are rejected. Circularity analyses distinguish somata from auto-fluorescent detritus (<b>A</b><sub><b>1</b></sub>, <b>A</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>) as well as contiguous soma-dendrite images (<b>B</b><sub><b>1</b></sub>, <b>B</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>) and isolated segments (shafts) of dendrites (<b>C</b><sub><b>1</b></sub>, <b>C</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>, <b>D</b><sub><b>1</b></sub>, <b>D</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>). Non-somatic auto-fluorescence is rejected because it does not accurately indicate underlying neurons. Dendritic segments are not valid targets because they are difficult to target in the ablation phase of the experiments and their cell bodies are detectable in adjacent focal planes. Often, a cell rejected by the circularity test in one focal plane (e.g., <b>C</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>, graygray double arrowhead) is validated in the adjacent plane (<b>D</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>, graygray double arrowhead). When ROIs that pass the circularity test are detected in more than one focal plane, they are validated or rejected according to the priority rule. ROIs from a deeper focal plane (\u221220 \u00b5m) are validated by circularity and thus colored red (<b>C</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>, circled ROIs). Subsequent detection of overlaying ROIs at the superficial focal plane (\u221210 \u00b5m), which also pass the circularity test, are nonetheless rejected by the priority rule and thus colored blue (<b>D</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>, circled ROIs). These criteria for target detection are more fully described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al. (2013)</a>."

XII amplitude decreased steeply with the tally of ablated cells, and then stabilized at 44% of its pre-lesion value (SD 4%, SEM 1%, suction electrode recordings are reported in normalized arbitrary units). Frequency, however, continued to decrease (i.e., cycle period increased) throughout the ablation phase. Initially, within the first dozen ablations, the average decrease in respiratory frequency was nearly twofold, and it continued to fall steeply until rhythm cessation (range of frequencies: 0.22\u20130.007 Hz, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> [inset shows bi-exponential increase in cycle period], <i>n</i> = 5 slices). Furthermore, the rhythm destabilized during the ablation phase. We defined regularity score (<i>RS</i>) as the ratio of the present cycle period with respect to the mean period over 10 prior cycles (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for <i>RS</i> formula). Cycle-to-cycle variations in <i>RS</i> indicate irregularity; the system is trending slower when <i>RS</i> exceeds unity. The <i>RS</i> of preB\u00f6tC-surface slices measured 1\u20139 during the ablation phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

Nonetheless, an alternative explanation could involve the loss of excitatory drive (rather than destruction of CPG core circuitry). Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons express neurokinin-1 peptide receptors (NK1Rs) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouvier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gray et al., 2010</a>) that stimulate respiratory rhythmogenesis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gray et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pagliardini et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ballanyi and Ruangkittisakul, 2009</a>). Monoaminergic and peptidergic raph\u00e9 neurons project to, and receive feedback projections from, the preB\u00f6tC to elevate excitability in the respiratory network (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ptak et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, laser ablation in the preB\u00f6tC could break the link with the raph\u00e9 and thus diminish excitatory drive. To test that idea, we exposed the lesioned preB\u00f6tC to a bolus of neuropeptide substance P (SP, 1 mM) after the respiratory cycle period exceeded 120 s, which we previously determined was a reliable benchmark of a slice that would cease rhythmic function within 5\u201310 min without pharmacological intervention (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hayes et al., 2012</a>)."

The regularity score was \u223c1 throughout the bout, which is consistent with the stable rhythm expected in unlesioned slices (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Then, SP was injected into five preB\u00f6tC-surface slices wherein the cumulative laser ablation of Dbx1 neurons caused 120 s of quiescence. SP transiently revived respiratory rhythm; the average cycle period was 1.7 s (SD 0.4 s, SEM 0.2 s, computed for 10 cycles after SP bolus injection) but the cycle period slowed down rapidly, surpassing the control period previously measured during the detection phase (4.7 s) within 3 min (SD 2 min, SEM 1 min). Cycle period continuously lengthened and fluctuated from cycle to cycle, and then the rhythm stopped altogether (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Judged on the basis of equilibration time, the transient effects of SP were significantly briefer in lesioned slices (p=0.02, Mann\u2013Whitney <i>U</i>-test). Furthermore, lesioned slices ultimately fell inexorably silent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A and 5C</a>), whereas unlesioned slices maintained rhythmicity for 4\u20136 hr (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). More importantly, the SP-evoked activity in lesioned preB\u00f6tC-surface slices was irregular: <i>RS</i> measured 2\u201310 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, compare to unlesioned slice in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These data indicate that NK1R-expressing Dbx1 neurons can evoke transient cycles of respiratory activity, but the loss of \u223c85 Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons slows the respiratory oscillator frequency and renders XII motor output nonfunctional."

These measures were computed after each cellular deletion and thus tracked continuously in parallel with the simulated networks. The table in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> reports the value of each topological measure prior to any deletions and after the final deletion associated with rhythm cessation (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for definitions and computational methods). From the start to finish, the cumulative ablation sequence caused no major change in local metrics including cluster coefficient, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. Global connectivity metrics such as the K-core, which has been applied to analyze rhythmic neural systems including the preB\u00f6tC (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schwab et al., 2010</a>), showed only modest changes that were incommensurate with the large changes in frequency observed in experiments and simulations. The number of strongly connected components in the model networks did not depart from unity, thus the underlying graph was not fractured and every constituent interneuron could be reached via a finite number of synaptic links from every other interneuron, even after the rhythm stopped. These calculations show that these relatively low numbers of cumulative cellular ablations do not disconnect or disintegrate the core CPG, which suggests that a breakdown in network structure cannot explain the impairment and cessation of rhythmic function. The alternative is that neurons and synapses confer non-linear functional properties to the underlying rhythmic system that are not captured by the graph connectivity alone (see \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

Additionally, we provide unanticipated new evidence that Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons also serve in a premotor capacity. While the existence of Dbx1 premotor neurons in the preB\u00f6tC is not a straightforward prediction of the Dbx1 core hypothesis, it does not contradict it. We propose that an inspiratory rhythmogenic core population co-localizes with a subpopulation of premotor neurons, and both have the same developmental-genetic lineage related to Dbx1.

The interpretability of these experiments suffered two caveats: the rhythm stopped after a delay of \u223c30 min following the final target ablation, and furthermore, the transmitter phenotype of the ablated targets was unknown. In this study, use of the <i>Dbx1</i> Cre-driver line ensured that the target neurons were glutamatergic, a requisite characteristic for respiratory rhythmogenic function (<a href=\"#bib23\">Greer et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Funk et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ge and Feldman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shao et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wall\u00e9n-Mackenzie et al., 2006</a>). And here, destroying an average of 85 Dbx1 neurons stopped the XII motor rhythm in the midst of the ablation phase, before exhausting the target list, which suggests a more direct impact on the core rhythmogenic circuit. We cannot rule out the possibility that subsets of preB\u00f6tC neurons generate \u2018burstlets\u2019 observable in local field recordings (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kam et al., 2013a</a>). However, there is no collective inspiratory motor output after sequential laser ablation of Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC interneurons, which indicates that the CPG is nonfunctional. Here, the debilitating effects on respiratory rhythm generation at a much lower ablation tally suggest that the preB\u00f6tC core in vitro is very sensitive to the loss of just a few constituent interneurons (i.e., &lt;100). This sensitivity to neuron loss may be accentuated in reduced slice preparations lacking excitatory and neuromodulatory drive from the rostral medulla and pons, as well as peripheral chemosensory and mechanosensory feedback via the vagus nerve. Extrinsic sources of drive raise preB\u00f6tC network excitability and enhance respiratory rhythm. An acute sensitivity to neuron loss, such as we report for slices, may not apply to the preB\u00f6tC network in vivo, but this remains to be tested via quantitative cellular ablation experiments with physiological monitoring in intact animal models."

Some fraction of the detected targets can be discounted as <i>Dbx1</i>-derived non-rhythmogenic glia (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gray et al., 2010</a>). However, more significantly, some fraction manifests premotor function. The present evidence for premotor function in Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons with verified inspiratory discharge patterns (e.g., <a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7 and 8D\u2013F</a>) is consistent with large-scale pressure ejections of biocytin in the preB\u00f6tC region of another strain of <i>Dbx1</i>-reporter mice (<i>Dbx1</i><sup><i>LacZ</i></sup> knock-in), which labeled many midline-crossing axons as well as axons projecting to the XII nucleus (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouvier et al., 2010</a>). Even 20 years ago it was recognized that a fraction of the excitatory neurons in the preB\u00f6tC, and immediately dorsal to preB\u00f6tC, had premotor functionality (<a href=\"#bib17\">Funk et al., 1993</a>). Because laser ablations in preB\u00f6tC-surface slices decreased XII magnitude (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A and 3A</a>), we propose that a non-negligible fraction of the ablated Dbx1 neurons were inspiratory modulated but non-rhythmogenic, and most likely constitute XII premotor neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Peever et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chamberlin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Koizumi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Volgin et al., 2008</a>). This scenario explains why there was a decline in XII motor output in experiments (deletion of Dbx1 premotor neurons causes motor output to decline) that was not mimicked by model simulations of a pure rhythmogenic circuit. It also explains why sequential ablations in simulations perturbed and stopped the rhythm at much lower cell ablation tallies; a significant fraction of the photonically ablated Dbx1 neurons were unrelated to rhythmogenesis per se."

Thus, we conclude the ability of Dbx1 preB\u00f6tC neurons to spontaneously generate rhythmic respiratory motor output in slice preparations is sensitive to deletion of 85 \u00b1 1.96(20) Dbx1 interneurons, i.e., 8\u201322% of its core. Although it cannot function spontaneously post-lesion, the rhythmogenic preB\u00f6tC core does not appear to be destroyed by piecewise lesioning. Peptide injections evoked irregular transient bursts in lesioned preB\u00f6tC-surface slices. Also, measures of local and global connectivity in lesioned network models remained undiminished after cumulative cell deletions stopped and precluded rhythmic function. Therefore, we propose that preB\u00f6tC function depends on non-trivial properties that emerge from non-linear synaptic and intrinsic membrane properties. Although such properties remain to be definitively determined, we advocate\u2014and have explicitly modeled\u2014a \u2018group pacemaker\u2019 rhythmogenic mechanism. In a group pacemaker, each constituent neuron forms recurrent connections with other constituent neurons in a network of finite size and amplifies excitatory drive via synaptically triggered inward currents (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rekling et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rekling and Feldman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rubin et al., 2009</a>). If that is a viable explanation for rhythmogenesis, then it could account for the loss of spontaneous function in the laser ablation context. Far before the cell ablation tally destroys the underlying network and its connectivity, the removal of each constituent neuron that contributes to rhythmic burst generation through its ability to amplify synaptic drive has a profound and deleterious effect on network functionality. The likelihood that arrhythmic respiratory networks retain considerable numbers of constituent neurons and interconnectivity suggests that unraveling the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of rhythmogenesis and motor output could be exploited to restore functionality in lesioned slices and, to the extent that our observations apply in vivo, to develop clinical therapies that bolster respiratory function in pathological conditions of animal models or human patients."

This routine detects particles using a threshold based on pixel intensity. It starts with a high value (near the maximum) and iteratively drops the threshold while accumulating particles (i.e., target ROIs) within a certain range of areas specified within the Ablator configuration. At first, with a high threshold, few local maxima are detected and the mask is small and sparse with ROIs. The routine then lowers the threshold by a user-defined increment and re-analyzes the image. As threshold decreases in steps, more ROIs become detectable. These newly detected ROIs are added to the mask, which expands the list of potential targets. The threshold is decreased incrementally over a number of partitions determined by the quotient of 4096 values of fluorescence intensity (for a 12-bit image) divided by the user-defined increment (above). As the detection process continues and threshold decreases incrementally, the smaller ROIs from prior iterations\u2014which are fully contained in larger ROIs from the current iteration\u2014are discarded, and the new larger ROIs are retained. Conversely, if a newly detected ROI at the current iteration envelopes two or more ROIs from a prior iteration, then the newly detected superset ROI is discarded and the multiple ROIs from the earlier iteration are retained. Thus the system avoids spuriously conflating two (or more) cells into a single target. After looping through all the partitions, the remaining set of ROIs is saved as the mask of potential target neurons for that focal plane."

Confirmed lesions add to a running tally. If lesion confirmation cannot be obtained, then the target selection algorithm does not advance and subsequent attempts are made to lesion the ROI. With each subsequent iteration, the scanning speed is decreased to improve the likelihood of lesioning the target. This loop repeats a total of five times. If confirmation of lesion cannot be ascertained after the fifth attempt, then it is deemed a failed lesion. Failed lesions do not contribute to the tally and their ROIs are removed from the list of targets to avoid reselection for the remainder of the experiment. A log file documents lesions by index number and time of confirmation. The XII rhythm is monitored and recorded continuously so its state can be directly correlated with the lesion tally in real time. Cell targets are destroyed in successful lesions so their effects are cumulative. The laser lesions are performed bilaterally in the preB\u00f6tC.

In discrete simulations, the lesion of neurons is modeled by removing vertices from the adjacency matrix along with their edges, i.e., connections (in and out). We computed three global metrics (K-core, number of strongly connected components, average in and out degree) for the initial network and the remaining network after a sequence of 100 random deletions. Also for each deleted vertex, we computed three local network metrics (local cluster coefficient, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality) to indicate the importance of the vertex within the previous network. The metrics are defined below and reported in the table of <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>."

They show elegantly that they do indeed and that progressive removal of just a small percentage of the population stops rhythmicity (which can then be transiently restored by SP injection) confirming a long standing hypothesis. More surprisingly ablation of these neurons diminishes motor outflow, suggesting that some Dbx1 interneurons are premotor. They then show with a few examples that in contrast to the rhythmogenic interneurons, which project to the contralateral pre-Bot, interneurons in the Dbx1 population project ipsilaterally to the motor nucleus XII suggesting that they are premotor. Computational modeling suggests that a proportion of the Dbx1 interneurons are not involved in rhythmogenesis."

Previous studies have suggested that Dbx1-expressing neurons are a superset of neurons in the mouse central nervous system and in respiratory-related regions of the medulla including premotor regions are largely glutamatergic neurons and in the preB\u00f6tC express several phenotypes that are thought to be hallmarks of inspiratory rhythm-generating interneurons.

Presumably, if the laser ablation approach interrogates network properties, then the properties of the constituent cells may not matter. However, in our view, since the experiments are actually performed on preB\u00f6tC interneurons, then the simulations should employ models that well represent preB\u00f6tC neurons. Therefore, we would substitute our model for a Morris-Lecar generalized model or a stripped-down Hodgkin-Huxley generic model. For the preB\u00f6tC, Rubin-Hayes is a model that we developed and thus advocate, but another contemporary model of preB\u00f6tC neurons was published by Rybak\u2019s group (Jasinski <i>et al. Eur J Neurosci</i> 37: 212-30, 2013), which builds on a model developed by Butera\u2019s group (Toporikova &amp; Butera. <i>J Comput Neurosci</i> 30: 515-28, 2011).

We have now begun replicating the simulations of the present study submitted to <i>eLife</i>, and we intend to publish the simulations of laser ablation using Jasinski-Rybak preB\u00f6tC neuron models in a forthcoming project.
