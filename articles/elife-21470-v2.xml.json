Here we probe polyomavirus SV40 endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-cytosol membrane transport, a decisive infection step where destabilization initiates this non-enveloped virus for membrane penetration. We find that a member of the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) called EMC1 promotes SV40 ER membrane transport and infection. Surprisingly, EMC1 does so by using its predicted transmembrane residue D961 to bind to and stabilize the membrane-embedded partially destabilized SV40, thereby preventing premature viral disassembly. EMC1-dependent stabilization enables SV40 to engage a cytosolic extraction complex that ejects the virus into the cytosol. Thus EMC1 acts as a molecular chaperone, bracing the destabilized SV40 in a transport-competent state. Our findings reveal the novel principle that coordinated destabilization-stabilization drives membrane transport of a non-enveloped virus."

While membrane penetration by enveloped viruses is reasonably well characterized, the mechanism by which non-enveloped viruses breach a host membrane remains largely enigmatic. For instance, insights into how the non-enveloped polyomavirus (PyV) penetrates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to reach the cytosol are only slowly emerging. Because PyV family members, including the human BK, JC, and Merkel cell PyV, cause debilitating and fatal human diseases, clarifying the precise molecular basis of this decisive infection step should advance our efforts to develop more effective therapies against PyV-induced human diseases (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeCaprio and Garcea, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jiang et al., 2009</a>)."

The assembled pentamers form a viral particle of approximately 45 nm in diameter, which encases the 5 kilobase DNA genome. SV40\u2019s disulfide bonds provide critical structural support for the viral particle, while the VP1 C-terminal arms invade neighboring pentamers to further stabilize the overall viral architecture (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stehle et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liddington et al., 1991</a>). Additionally, calcium ions bound to SV40 strengthens inter-pentamer interactions (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stehle et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liddington et al., 1991</a>). To infect cells, SV40 traffics from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gilbert and Benjamin, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Qian et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kartenbeck et al., 1989</a>) where it penetrates the ER membrane to reach the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib18\">Inoue and Tsai, 2011</a>).

Specifically, upon reaching the ER, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family members including PDI and ERdj5 isomerize and reduce SV40\u2019s disulfide bonds (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schelhaas et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Inoue et al., 2015</a>); for the murine PyV and possibly JC PyV, another non-catalytically active PDI family member ERp29 locally unfolds the VP1 C-terminal arm (<a href=\"#bib28\">Magnuson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Walczak and Tsai, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nelson et al., 2012</a>). These reactions disrupt the viral architecture, exposing its hydrophobic proteins VP2 and VP3 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Magnuson et al., 2005</a>).

Specifically we find that EMC1, the largest component of a poorly-characterized ER transmembrane protein complex called ER membrane protein complex (EMC), is a C18 binding partner that promotes SV40 ER membrane penetration and infection; it also supports BK PyV infection. Surprisingly, EMC1 does so by acting as a molecular chaperone, using its highly conserved predicted transmembrane D961 residue to bind to and stabilize the partially destabilized membrane-penetrating SV40, which likely exposes positively-charged residues on its surface. This interaction braces the virus in a proper conformation so that it can engage the cytosolic extraction machinery and eject into the cytosol. Our results indicate that opposing host-encoded forces coordinately destabilize and stabilize SV40, complementing each other to achieve successful membrane transport. This principle should be broadly applicable to other non-enveloped viruses, where destabilization initiates their membrane transport (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tsai, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baer and Dermody, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Belnap et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wiethoff et al., 2005</a>). Moreover, as the EMC executes important but undefined roles during flavivirus (including Zika, Dengue, and West Nile virus) infection (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Savidis et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Marceau et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>), our findings should have general implications beyond the PyV field."

                                "text": "Previous studies found that three ER membrane J-proteins C18, B12, and B14 execute important yet non-overlapping roles during SV40 ER membrane penetration (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walczak et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ravindran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goodwin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bagchi et al., 2015</a>). We hypothesize that their unique functions may be attributed to their ability to interact with different binding partners, which are all essential in promoting this membrane penetration event. As little is known regarding C18\u2019s binding partners, we sought to identify cellular components that interact with this J-protein using a biochemical approach. We first generated a tetracycline inducible 3XFLAG-tagged C18 expressing stable Flp-In 293T-REx cell line [Flp-In 293T-REx (3XFLAG-C18)]. When induced, the level of 3XFLAG-C18 was expressed at a slightly lower level than endogenous C18 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To identify C18-binding partners, cells were induced, mock infected or infected with SV40, then lysed with a mild detergent (Deoxy Big CHAP/DBC) to maintain protein-protein interactions during immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-FLAG conjugated agarose beads. To control for non-specific binding to the agarose beads, a cellular extract was generated from uninfected parental Flp-In 293T-REx cells, which does not express 3XFLAG-C18 (Flp-In 293T REx). After elution by 3XFLAG peptide, the eluted material was concentrated and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Importantly, numerous bands appeared in samples prepared from the C18 expressing but not the parental cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, silver stained gel, compare lane 2 to 1). As no significant differences were observed between the mock and SV40 infected samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, silver stained gel, compare lane 2 to 3), co-precipitated proteins which were reproducibly observed by silver staining were excised from only the SV40 infected sample, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The results identified potential C18 interacting partners (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, silver stained gel), including an approximately 110 kDa protein called ER membrane protein complex subunit 1 (EMC1). EMC1 is predicted to be a single-pass type I ER-resident transmembrane protein that is the largest component of a multiprotein complex called ER membrane protein complex (EMC), which consists of 10 proteins in humans (<a href=\"#bib6\">Christianson et al., 2012</a>). Because the EMC was previously implicated in an ER-to-cytosol transport pathway called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Christianson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jonikas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ruggiano et al., 2014</a>), we focused this study on EMC1 because SV40 similarly undergoes ER-to-cytosol transport. To validate the mass spectrometry data, the same samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE following by immunoblotting using a specific antibody against EMC1, which confirmed the identity of this protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, top panel); as expected, C18 also binds to Hsc70 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, middle panel). When the entire precipitated material prepared from C18-expressing and control parental cells were subjected to \u2018shot-gun\u2019 mass spectrometry analyses, in addition to peptides matching EMC1, peptides corresponding to EMC2, EMC3, EMC4, EMC6, and EMC10 were also identified (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In all cases, the number of peptides identified was less than the amount identified for EMC1. This could simply reflect the fact that EMC1 is the largest EMC subunit, or that EMC1 is present in the highest concentration in the precipitated material. Whether Erlin1 and Erlin2, ER membrane factors that appeared to co-precipitate with C18 and also previously implicated in ERAD (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2009</a>), control SV40 ER membrane penetration will not be addressed in the current investigation."

                                "text": "Because EMC1 executes an important role during PyV infection, and that ER-to-cytosol membrane transport is essential during virus infection, we reasoned that the EMC1 is strategically localized at the ER membrane to control this entry step. To test this, we used a cell-based, semi-permeabilized membrane transport assay previously developed in our laboratory designed to monitor ER-to-cytosol membrane transport of SV40 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Inoue and Tsai, 2011</a>). In this assay, SV40 infected CV-1 cells are treated with the detergent digitonin that selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane while leaving internal membranes (including the ER) intact. The samples were centrifuged to generate a supernatant and pellet fraction. The supernatant (cytosol) should harbor cytosolic proteins and SV40 that has reached the cytosol from the ER, while the pellet (membrane) should contain cellular membranes as well as virus in membranes (including the ER). The integrity of this fractionation procedure was verified by immunoblotting the cytosol and membrane fractions for the presence of cytosolic (Hsp90) or membrane (ER-resident BiP) markers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, compare 2nd to 5th panels, and 6th to 3rd panels). Using this method, we found that depleting EMC1 potently decreased the VP1 level (which represents SV40) in the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, top panel; the VP1 band intensity in the cytosol is quantified in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), indicating that EMC1 is crucial for promoting SV40 ER-to-cytosol transport. We then asked if SV40 arrival to the ER from the cell surface was affected by downregulating EMC1 using a biochemical extraction protocol previously developed in our laboratory(<a href=\"#bib18\">Inoue and Tsai, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Walczak et al., 2014</a>). In this protocol, the membrane fraction was treated with Triton X-100 to extract detergent soluble virus, which represents ER-localized SV40. This is because only SV40 that successfully reaches the ER can detach from Triton X-100 insoluble lipid rafts and be released into the ER lumen whose content now becomes extractable by this detergent (<a href=\"#bib18\">Inoue and Tsai, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Walczak et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, using this approach, we found that the level of ER-localized virus was the same between control and knockdown samples (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, bottom panel; the VP1 band intensity in the ER-localized fraction is quantified in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), demonstrating that EMC1 does not regulate SV40 trafficking from the plasma membrane to the ER. Hence, the block in SV40 arrival to the cytosol in EMC1-depleted cells reflects a specific role of EMC1 during the viral ER-to-cytosol membrane penetration step. As a negative control, silencing EMC1 did not interfere with ER-to-cytosol transport of another toxic agent cholera toxin\u2019s catalytic CTA1 subunit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), indicating that EMC1 depletion did not globally affect all ER membrane transport processes."

We now find that SV40 similarly triggers FLAG-tagged wild type (WT) EMC1 (EMC1-FLAG) to mobilize into the foci structure (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). By contrast, the ER membrane protein Sel1L (S/His-Sel1L) does not mobilize into the BAP31-positive foci structure (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bagchi et al., 2015</a>).

Second, we asked if the mutants are properly oriented in the ER membrane by performing a deglycosylation assay. EMC1 has three predicted glycosylation sites in its luminal domain. We reasoned that if the EMC1 mutants are inserted in the proper orientation, it should be glycosylated - their ability to be deglycosylated would therefore reflect proper insertion. Accordingly, cell extracts containing WT EMC1-FLAG or the two EMC1 mutants were treated with endoglycosidase H, subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using anti- FLAG antibody. We found that both the D961A and T976A EMC1-FLAG mutants displayed a similar faster migration pattern as WT EMC1-FLAG when treated with this deglycosidase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, compare odd to even lanes), suggesting that the orientation of the EMC1 mutants is the same as WT EMC1. Third, we interrogated whether the EMC1 mutants can bind to EMC1\u2019s newly identified binding partner C18, and found that they did (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, top panel, compare lane 2 to lanes 3 and 4).

Using this protocol, we found that adding back WT EMC1 to cells transfected with EMC1 siRNA #1 fully rescued SV40 infection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, compare third to second bar), unambiguously demonstrating that the block in SV40 infection and ER-to-cytosol transport due to EMC1 siRNA #1 treatment is specifically a result of depleting EMC1 and not to off-target effects. Importantly, whereas expressing the T976A mutant also restored infection, expression of the D961A mutant did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, compare fifth to fourth bars).

Mass spectrometry analyses of the WT and D961A EMC1 samples indicated that no other EMC subunits were present (not shown). This was not surprising because the purifications were intentionally performed in the presence of the harsher detergent Triton X-100, which prevented other EMC subunits from co-purification. Previous studies revealed that SV40 is partially destabilized in the ER (<a href=\"#bib19\">Inoue et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Magnuson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Walczak and Tsai, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nelson et al., 2012</a>), an effect that can be mimicked in part by treating purified SV40 with DTT (which reduces the SV40 disulfide bonds) and EGTA (which removes calcium bound to the virus). Indeed, when SV40 was incubated with either GFP-FLAG or WT EMC1-FLAG in the presence or absence of DTT/EGTA, pull down of EMC1 but not GFP precipitated SV40 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, top panel, compare lane 2 to 1), demonstrating a direct EMC1-SV40 interaction. By contrast, EMC1 did not interact with untreated native SV40 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, top panel, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that EMC1 recognizes a partially destabilized form of SV40.

                                "text": "What might be the functional significance of the EMC1-SV40 interaction? Because we postulate that EMC1 acts as a transmembrane chaperone, it might use its D961 residue localized within the lipid bilayer to recognize and promote stabilization of membrane-inserted SV40 during the penetration process, as suggested by our finding that the D961 residue plays an important role in EMC1-SV40 binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In this scenario, we envision that depleting EMC1 should destabilize SV40 in the ER, and as a consequence, trigger premature viral disassembly. To test this, we probed ER-localized SV40\u2019s structural integrity under the EMC1-depleted condition. We previously established a sucrose sedimentation assay that can distinguish between small/disassembled versus large/intact viral particles (<a href=\"#bib18\">Inoue and Tsai, 2011</a>). In this assay, a virus sample is layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (20\u201350% sucrose), centrifuged, individual samples collected from top of the gradient, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting to detect presence of the virus. Virus in the bottom fraction corresponds to large/intact particles, while those in higher fractions contain small/disassembled virus. When ER-localized virus derived from control cells was analyzed, the virus was found in the bottom fraction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, top panel), suggesting that SV40 remains largely intact despite being partially destabilized in the ER. However, when ER-localized virus derived from EMC1-depleted cells was isolated and subjected to the same procedure, a distinct virus pool is present throughout the higher fractions corresponding to disassembled virus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, 2nd panel); these species likely reflect single, as well as oligomeric, VP1 pentamers. Hence a portion of ER-localized SV40 disassembles prematurely in EMC1-depleted cells. As disassembled ER-localized virus is found in the absence of EMC1, this finding suggests that EMC1 acts to stabilize SV40. We note that only a small virus pool was disassembled, consistent with the fact that only a small fraction of the total ER-localized virus attempts to penetrate the ER membrane; most remain in the ER lumen. To rule out the possibility that simply imposing a block in SV40 ER-to-cytosol transport is sufficient to cause viral premature disassembly, ER-localized virus derived from SGTA- or C18-depleted cells, which also display a strong impairment in SV40 ER-to-cytosol transport (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walczak et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goodwin et al., 2011</a>), was isolated and subjected to the same procedure. However, no disassembled virus appeared in these samples (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, 3rd and 4th panels). Thus, the appearance of the disassembled virus is not a general consequence of blocking ER membrane transport, but points to a specific role of EMC1 in conferring virus stability."

When purified SV40 incubated with the control protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) was layered over a discontinuous (20\u201340%) sucrose gradient, centrifuged, the individual fractions collected, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting, the virus was found mostly in the bottom fractions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, top panel). When high concentrations of DTT (which reduces the viral disulfide bonds) and EGTA (which removes calcium bound to SV40) were added to completely disrupt inter-pentamer interactions, essentially all the virus now remains in the top fractions, indicating that significant disassembly occurred as expected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, second panel). However, if EMC1 was simultaneously incubated in the presence of the destabilizing agents (DTT/EGTA), a significant pool of SV40 sediments to the bottom fraction, representing intact virus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, third panel). This finding suggests that EMC1 protects SV40 against disassembly, supporting the notion that it acts to stabilize the virus. However, when SV40 was pre-treated with DTT/EGTA and then incubated with WT EMC1, the virus level that sediments to the bottom fraction decreased significantly compared to when WT EMC1 was simultaneously incubated with DTT/EGTA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, compare fourth to third panel). This result demonstrates that WT EMC1 cannot confer protection against viral disassembly once the virus has disassembled. Importantly, the D961A EMC1 mutant did not provide strong protection against DTT/EGTA-induced SV40 disassembly when compared to WT EMC1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, compare fifth to third panel). When quantified, WT EMC1 protected more than 66% of SV40 against DTT/EGTA-triggered disassembly whereas the mutant EMC1 protected approximately 18% of the virus against disassembly, where virus in fractions 1\u20136 represents disassembled virus and those in fractions 7\u20139 represents largely intact particles (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ravindran et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

To test this possibility, we first asked if Hsc70 is able to capture SV40 when EMC1 is downregulated. Cells expressing S-tagged Hsc70 (Hsc70-S) were transfected with either scrambled or EMC1 #1 siRNA. When Hsc70-S was affinity purified from the resulting WCE, SV40 was only pulled down using extracts from control but not EMC1-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, top panel, compare lane 2 to 1). By contrast, endogenous SGTA was precipitated under both conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, second panel, compare lane 1 to 2), suggesting that knocking down EMC1 did not affect the integrity of the Hsc70-SGTA interaction. These data demonstrate that lack of EMC1, a condition that generates prematurely disassembled SV40 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), prevents Hsc70 from interacting with the viral particle. A similar result was found for SGTA: EMC1 knockdown prevents (transfected) SGTA from binding to SV40 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, top panel, compare lane 4 to 3), but not to endogenous Hsc70 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, second panel, compare lane 4 to 3). Together, these findings demonstrate that EMC1 is required to allow SV40 to engage the cytosolic extraction machinery. It is possible that depleting EMC1 precludes the Hsc70-SGTA complex from interacting with C18 \u2013 mislocalization of the extraction machinery would effectively prevent it from ejecting SV40 into the cytosol. However, we found that precipitating C18-S pulled down endogenous Hsc70 and SGTA regardless of EMC1\u2019s presence (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, top and second panels, compare lane 2 to 1); silencing EMC1 also preserved the interaction between SGTA and Hsp105 with another J-protein B14 (not shown). Hence, as the extraction machinery remains tethered to ER membrane J-proteins even in EMC1\u2019s absence, the simplest explanation for why depleting EMC1 prevents the extraction machinery from capturing SV40 is that the viral particle experienced premature disassembly, thereby precluding its interaction with this machinery. This explanation supports the view that EMC1 braces membrane-embedded SV40 in a membrane penetration-competent state."

By contrast, we report here that virus stabilization can also serve a crucial function during viral entry.

This residue likely functions within the membrane-spanning domain (or at the membrane border), and must act in concert with the rest of EMC1\u2019s transmembrane domain to accomplish its role. Because membrane-penetrating SV40 is partially destabilized, EMC1\u2019s interaction stabilizes the overall viral architecture either within the ER lipid bilayer or at the earliest phase of the membrane insertion process. This prevents the viral particle from undergoing premature disassembly. Importantly, stabilization maintains the virus in a transport-competent state, enabling it to be recognized by the cytosolic Hsc70-SGTA-Hsp105 extraction machinery, which completes the membrane transport process by ejecting the virus into the cytosol. Thus, ironically, while host encoded forces that destabilize SV40 are known to promote viral ER-to-cytosol transport (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ravindran et al., 2015</a>), an opposing force that stabilizes SV40 appears to play an equally important role during this step. The concept that coordinated interplay between destabilization and stabilization drive PyV entry may have broad implications in illuminating other viral entry mechanisms, including enveloped viruses. For instance, in destabilizing the enveloped virus HIV during entry, host factors also stabilize the viral capsid in a concerted manner in order to prevent its premature uncoating, which otherwise prevents infection (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guth and Sodroski, 2014</a>). Thus, there is clearly a precedent for the hypothesis that coordinated destabilization-stabilization is an important (yet poorly-explored) concept during viral entry."

Hence, EMC1\u2019s transmembrane domain might function as a \u2018sensor\u2019, recognizing exposure of aberrant membrane-spanning residues in substrates. Because VP2 and VP3 are exposed in the membrane-inserted virus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Magnuson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Norkin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Rainey-Barger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuksin and Norkin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Daniels et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Geiger et al., 2011</a>), it is tempting to speculate that despite the overall hydrophobic nature of these internal proteins, positively-charged residues of VP2/VP3 may be sensed by EMC1 via D961. This idea is supported by our data that a VP1-VLP lacking VP2 and VP3 displayed less efficient binding to EMC1 when compared to WT SV40 that harbors these internal proteins. The proposed charge-charge interaction would be analogous to sensing of VP2\u2019s negatively-charged D17 residue by the positively-charged R transmembrane residues of the ER membrane protein BAP31 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Geiger et al., 2011</a>). Positively-charged residues exposed in the coat protein VP1 may also represent the contact point with EMC1, since VP1-VLP appears to be sufficient in providing some level of interaction with this transmembrane protein."

The postulated exposure of the positively-charged residues in SV40 might cause electrostatic repulsion between the viral particles that would destabilize its structural integrity. Furthermore, displaying positive charges on the viral surface within the hydrophobic ER lipid bilayer creates a highly energetically unfavorable condition. Thus stabilization might reflect a rather passive process in which EMC1 simply shields these charges. Alternatively, EMC1-dependent stabilization may be a more complex active process. For instance, upon recognizing exposure of aberrant residues in membrane-embedded SV40 via EMC1\u2019s transmembrane domain, EMC1\u2019s luminal domain might subsequently be recruited to provide VP1 inter-pentamer interactions. Our sucrose sedimentation analyses revealed that in infected cells devoid of EMC1, different prematurely disassembled VP1 species, likely corresponding to single and oligomeric VP1 pentamers, are generated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This observation suggests that EMC1 stabilizes inter-pentamer interactions. To enhance VP1 inter-pentamer interactions, EMC1 may exists as oligomers that enable each EMC1 monomer to crosslink to an individual VP1 molecule belonging to different pentamers. Clearly these two possibilities do not have to be mutually exclusive \u2013 EMC1 may operate in both manners to shield the presumed exposed charges and to reinforce interactions between the pentamers. In our in vitro analyses, addition of DTT and EGTA also generated VP1 pentamers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), whose formation can be largely suppressed by addition of purified EMC1; DTT likely mimics viral disulfide bond reduction that occurs in the ER lumen (<a href=\"#bib19\">Inoue et al., 2015</a>), whereas EGTA may imitate loss of Ca2+ from the membrane-embedded virus when it is exposed to the low Ca2+ in the cytosol, as previously hypothesized (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schelhaas et al., 2007</a>)."

Because our findings demonstrate that EMC1 is sufficient to function as a molecular chaperone, whether other EMC subunits can also act in a similar role or execute completely different functions remain to be clarified. The EMC was initially identified in yeast, although its precise function was not fully clarified (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jonikas et al., 2009</a>). This complex was proposed to function within an ER quality control process called ERAD, in which misfolded ER proteins are targeted to the cytosol for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ruggiano et al., 2014</a>). This possibility is consistent with the finding demonstrating that different EMC subunits physically associate with other components of the ERAD machinery (<a href=\"#bib6\">Christianson et al., 2012</a>). Strikingly, ER-to-cytosol transport of a misfolded substrate during ERAD is highly reminiscent of the pathway SV40 experiences during its ER membrane transport. Another related ER quality control function attributed to the EMC is its ability to support biosynthesis of multi-pass transmembrane proteins, such as the ionotropic acetylcholine receptor (<a href=\"#bib38\">Richard et al., 2013</a>) and rhodopsin (<a href=\"#bib40\">Satoh et al., 2015</a>). In these cases, the EMC appears to serve as a transmembrane chaperone, promoting the stabilization of the membrane protein folding-intermediates. This idea would agree with our postulate that EMC1 acts as a molecular chaperone to stabilize the membrane-embedded SV40 viral particle. A final but rather distinct function posited for the EMC lies in its ability to physically tether the ER to mitochondria in order to facilitate phospholipid transfer between these two organelles (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lahiri et al., 2014</a>). How this function might be linked to EMC\u2019s role in ERAD or membrane protein biosynthesis is difficult to envision, but hints to possibility that the EMC may subserve completely different cellular activities."

The authors initially find EMC1 via its interaction with C18, an ER-localized J-domain protein that is thought to act on the cytosolic side at the step of SV40 entry into this compartment. Loss of EMC1 results in decreased SV40 entry into the cytosol, and this activity seems to need D961, an acidic residue near the TM domain of EMC1. The function of EMC1 seems to be the transient stabilization of SV40 after its initial destabilization by reductases in the ER lumen. This stabilization prevents premature disassembly before entering the cytosol and engagement of cytosolic factors. The arguments are built on a series of physical interaction analyses by co-immunoprecipitation (often with tagged proteins over-expressed in cultured cells), loss-of-function studies using siRNA knockdowns, and cytosolic penetration assays."

These observations are similar to the D961A EMC1 point mutant, which also fails to restore infection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and binds to the virus less effectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Thus, D961 of EMC1 functions during SV40 ER membrane penetration either within the membrane-spanning domain or at the membrane border, and must act coordinately with the rest of EMC1\u2019s transmembrane domain to accomplish its role. Because membrane-penetrating SV40 is partially destabilized, EMC1\u2019s interaction stabilizes the overall viral architecture either within the ER lipid bilayer or at the earliest phase of the membrane insertion process.

Specifically, whereas we found 46 peptides corresponding to EMC1 using the WT EMC1 prep and 42 peptides corresponding to EMC1 using the D961A EMC1 prep, we did not identify any peptides corresponding to other EMC subunits. These findings are not surprising because we intentionally used the harsh detergent Triton X-100 (1%) during purification, which would preclude co-purification of other EMC subunits. Therefore, any difference in activity between the WT and D961A EMC1 preps in our experiments is due to the specific EMC1 mutation."

It should be noted that, to identify potential C18-binding partners, the gentle detergent deoxyBigChap (1%) was used in order to preserve weak protein-protein interactions. Our new analyses revealed that, in addition to peptides matching EMC1, peptides corresponding to EMC2, EMC3, EMC4, EMC6, and EMC10 were also identified (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In all cases, the number of peptides identified was less than the amount identified for EMC1.

We now find that depleting EMC4, EMC6, and EMC7 significantly decreased virus infection, depleting EMC3, EMC5, and EMC10 partially impaired infection, while depleting EMC2, EMC8, and EMC9 (postulated cytosolic components of the EMC) had no effect on infection (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These analyses clearly raise the possibility that other EMC subunits may be involved in SV40 infection, potentially in conducting SV40 across the ER membrane.

In the revision, we now demonstrate that SV40 similarly triggers WT EMC1-FLAG to mobilize into the foci structure (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results support the idea that EMC1 executes a specific function in promoting SV40 ER membrane penetration."

In other words, it seems important to show that this bright spot is not simply total ER enriched in this area.</i>"

Moreover, we also previously published that the ER membrane protein Hrd1 (which forms a complex with Sel1L) also does not form virus-induced foci (Walczak et al., 2014, PLoS Pathogen, 10, e1004007)."
