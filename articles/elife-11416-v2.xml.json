Abnormal layout of cortical areas may disrupt sensory function and behavior. Developmental genetic mechanisms specify primary areas, but mechanisms influencing higher order area properties are unknown. By exploiting gain-of and loss-of function mouse models of the transcription factor <i>Emx2</i>, we have generated bi-directional changes in primary visual cortex size in vivo and have used it as a model to show a novel and prominent function for genetic mechanisms regulating primary visual area size and also proportionally dictating the sizes of surrounding higher order visual areas. This finding redefines the role for intrinsic genetic mechanisms to concomitantly specify and scale primary and related higher order sensory areas in a linear fashion."

Abnormal layout of cortical areas may disrupt sensory function and behavior. Developmental genetic mechanisms specify primary areas, but mechanisms influencing higher order area properties are unknown. By exploiting gain-of and loss-of function mouse models of the transcription factor <i>Emx2</i>, we have generated bi-directional changes in primary visual cortex size in vivo and have used it as a model to show a novel and prominent function for genetic mechanisms regulating primary visual area size and also proportionally dictating the sizes of surrounding higher order visual areas. This finding redefines the role for intrinsic genetic mechanisms to concomitantly specify and scale primary and related higher order sensory areas in a linear fashion."

In the cortex, the connections of TCAs establish precise topographic representations (or maps) of the sensory periphery (<a href=\"#bib14\">Krubitzer and Kaas, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">O'Leary et al., 2013</a>). Primary areas are flanked by higher order sensory areas (HO), which are interconnected with them and also contain topographic maps (<a href=\"#bib5\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</a>). In mammals, this evolutionarily conserved general layout of the intra-areal neural circuits is responsible for the orderly progression of sensory information, sensory perception and the integration of higher cortical functions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Geschwind and Rakic, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Krubitzer and Kaas, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Laram\u00e9e and Boire, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">O'Leary et al., 2013</a>). Disrupted layouts of cortical area layouts appear to be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism (<a href=\"#bib4\">Courchesne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Voineagu et al., 2011</a>). Studies of cortical arealization, the mechanisms that pattern the neocortex into areas, have focused almost exclusively on the primary areas and have led to the prevailing model that genetic mechanisms intrinsic to the neocortex control arealization during early cortical development (<a href=\"#bib10\">Greig et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Krubitzer and Kaas, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">O'Leary et al., 2013</a>). For example, the graded expression of the homeodomain transcription factor <i>Emx2</i> in neocortical progenitors determines the size and position of the primary visual area (V1) in mice (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bishop et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hamasaki et al., 2004</a>). Although higher order areas outnumber primary areas by roughly 10-fold (<a href=\"#bib20\">Marshel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>), mechanisms that specify them and define their proportions relative to primary areas have yet to be explored."

                        "text": "To investigate the impact of altered primary area size on higher order areas, we have used the cortical visual area V1 as a model. Previous studies have shown that genetic manipulation of patterning genes, including <i>Fgf17</i> and <i>Emx2,</i> results in altered V1 size (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cholfin and Rubenstein, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hamasaki et al., 2004</a>). Here we have analyzed transgenic mice that overexpress <i>Emx2 (ne-Emx2</i>) and show area patterning defects including a V1 that is ~150% of the normal size, while retaining overall normal neocortex size (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hamasaki et al., 2004</a> <a href=\"#bib17\">Leing\u00e4rtner et al., 2007</a>). By revealing the targeting patterns of TCAs projecting from thalamic sensory nuclei into the cortex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fujimiya et al., 1986</a>), the perimeters of primary sensory areas and the border between the neocortex and entorhinal cortex (ECT) can be visualized by serotonin (5HT) staining using a single postnatal day (P) 7 tangential section of the flattened cortical hemisphere (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The staining shows that, in addition to the previously reported enlarged V1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hamasaki et al., 2004</a>,; <a href=\"#bib17\">Leing\u00e4rtner et al., 2007</a>), the cortical tissue that is nested between V1 and the surrounding primary areas (primary somatosensory cortex: S1, auditory areas: Aud) and the ECT laterally appears qualitatively larger in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains, when compared to wildtype (wt) sections (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We have defined this caudal cortical territory, which lies outside of V1, S1, and the auditory areas and shows no or weak 5HT staining as a joint higher order cortical area complex and have termed it HO-5HT. The 5HTstaining revealed that this region contains the higher order visual areas surrounding V1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>), the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) medially, and the ventral posterior temporal cortex laterally. The accurate distribution of staining across cortical layers can only be estimated using tangential sections. However, using P7 sagittal section, we confirmed in layer 4 that the caudal 5HT-positive cortical area (corresponding to V1) and the anteriorly adjacent 5HT-negative area between V1 and S1 (corresponding to HO-5HT) appears larger in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains than in wt ones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Next, we labeled TCAs projecting to V1 by filling the dLG with crystals of the lipophilic neuronal tracer DiI. On the\u00a0P7 sagittal sections that were derived from five different medial to lateral levels, anterograde DiI labeling in the cortex revealed\u00a0that TCAs from the dLG terminate in a smaller region in wt than in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Across genotypes, the DiI staining revealed\u00a0a sharp border with adjacent cortical tissues\u00a0that\u00a0did not receive TCAs input from the dLG (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This finding is consistent with the 5HT staining and indicates a well-defined border between V1 neighboring higher order areas that is anteriorly shifted in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains."

We therefore predicted that the areal shifts in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains would be accompanied by corresponding changes in layer 5 output projections. We labeled two distinct types of layer 5 subcerebral projection neurons by inserting DiI crystals either into the superior colliculus, which labels corticotectal projections from V1 and HO, or else into the pyramidal decussation, which labels corticospinal projections from the frontal cortex and S1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Greig et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Zembrzycki et al., 2015</a>).

Therefore, to compare functional neuronal properties of an enlarged visual cortex to a normal-sized one, we have used Fourier intrinsic signal optical imaging to construct topographic visual response maps to light bars that were moved across the visual field of the retina (up and down: elevation maps; left to right: azimuth maps) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</a>). Visual responses in V1 of wt and <i>ne-Emx2</i> mice produced intrinsic signal maps that were indistinguishable in strength, and the axes of azimuth and elevation were organized in the same way in all tested brains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), revealing that functional topographic organization of the visual cortex was intact. However, the representations of elevation and azimuth were expanded in <i>ne-Emx2</i> animals, and their retinotopic maps were overall larger (elevation: 138% \u00b1 8.7% of wt; azimuth: 143% \u00b1 8.2% of wt).

To investigate the relationship between the location and size of the V1 functional response area and the histochemically delineated V1, as indicated by 5HT staining, multiple injections of DiI were placed lining the border of the V1 optical response map after the imaging procedure. On 5HT-stained, flattened tangential cortical sections, the DiI injection sites were found in all cases to be located near the border of the 5HT staining in V1, confirming the\u00a0overall enlarged V1 perimeters in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains compared with\u00a0the wt brains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This shows that the 5HT-stained V1 area accurately corresponds to the intrinsic functional V1 map, suggesting that enlarged HO in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains have not acquired ectopic V1-like functional properties."

Stereotypically, V1 is connected with the dLG, whereas the HO areas are wired to the posterior thalamic nucleus (PO) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Leyva-D\u00edaz and L\u00f3pez-Bendito, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">L\u00f3pez-Bendito and Moln\u00e1r, 2003</a>). To first label axonal connections between the cortex and the thalamus in wt brains, we administered dual tracer injections into locations that approximate to HO (DiD: green dye) and another injection around the approximated border area between V1 and HO (DiI: red dye). After diffusion of the tracers, we performed 5HT staining on flattened cortex sections to identify the areas in which the injections were administered and analyzed the patterns of retrograde dye labeling on coronal sections of the thalamus. In representative cases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) where 5HT staining confirmed that DiI was injected at the border between V1 and HO and DiD was injected into HO, retrogradely labeled green DiD cells were apparent in the dLG and the PO. Conversely, red DiI cells were only labeled in the dLG. In <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains, we administered similar dual tracer injections: DiI was targeted to V1 and a DiD injection was administered around the approximate border between V1 and HO. Due to their enlarged V1, all <i>ne-Emx2</i> injections were administered at more anterior coordinates than in wt brains (compare dashed lines in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In representative cases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) where 5HT staining confirmed that the DiI injection was administered into V1 and DiD was injected around the V1/HO border, red cells were found in the dLG, whereas green-labeled cells were apparent in the PO and the dLG. The dual tracings in wt and <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains are consistent with the predicted connectivity of cortical neurons around the injection sites (<a href=\"#bib18\">Leyva-D\u00edaz and L\u00f3pez-Bendito, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">L\u00f3pez-Bendito and Moln\u00e1r, 2003</a>). Although located more anteriorly in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains, the subcortical connectivity patterns around the V1/HO borders were similar, demonstrating that these neurons show connectivity patterns that are consistent with their intrinsic areal identity\u00a0and not their topographic location on the cortical sheet. Taken together, our results indicate that increased V1 size in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains is accompanied by a concomitant enlargement and anterior shift of HO."

An accurate assessment of area sizes using flattened and/or sectioned cortical tissues could potentially be hampered by imperfect flattening of the tissues or by cutting artifacts. Therefore, we have used RNA in situ hybridization on intact whole brains (whole mount in situ hybridization: WMISH) at P7 for quantification purposes, which has the advantage that quantifications can be made using single images without sectioning and artifacts that may arise from such tissue processing. We first used a set of two marker genes, <i>Unc5d</i> and <i>Igfbp5</i>, whose expression delineates V1 at P7 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chou et al., 2013</a>). The gene expression domains on WMISH-stained brains were outlined and their sizes quantified as a measure of V1 area size. The mean value of wt brains was defined as 100% and the area size percentages of <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains displayed accordingly as \u2018percent of wt\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Previous studies have parsed higher order visual areas using neuroanatomical tracers (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>) (see also schematic in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and have revealed genes that are expressed at different levels in V1 and higher order visual areas (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chou et al., 2013</a>). For example, <i>Cdh8</i> and <i>Lmo4</i> expression is higher in the area surrounding V1, where higher order visual areas are located (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Marshel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>). The domains of high <i>Cdh8</i> and <i>Lmo4</i> expression appear to label higher order visual areas uniformly (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chou et al., 2013</a>), without revealing subdivisions between them (compare schematic in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> showing approximate location and outline of higher order visual areas as identified by <a href=\"#bib27\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a> to <i>Cdh8</i> and <i>Lmo4</i> gene expression domains around V1). On P7 WMISH-stained wt brains, we quantified the V1 and HO sizes in the medial cortex on the basis of low and high gene expression domains (see dotted lines in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Anatomically, these gene expression domains surrounding V1,\u00a0which show much stronger staining compared with V1, extend anteriorly up to the S1 border, laterally to the border of the auditory areas and the ECT and medially up to the border to the RSC, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). Hence, compared with the above-mentioned HO complex that was identified using 5HT staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the higher order area complex labeled by <i>Cdh8</i> and <i>Lmo4</i> relates to a smaller cortical region that more closely relates to higher order visual areas, but excludes the RSC. The size (<i>Cdh8</i>-V1: 145.3 \u00b1 7.4%, p &lt; 0.0001; <i>Lmo4</i>-V1: 146.6% \u00b1 6.7%, p = 0.0005) and shape of the gene expression domains in V1 were similar in <i>Cdh8</i>- and <i>Lmo4</i>-stained brains. Similarly, the gene expression domains nested around V1 largely overlapped between the two probes. The only apparent difference between them is around the anteromedial edge of the higher order visual areas (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>), where <i>Cdh8</i> is expressed at much lower levels compared to more lateral regions around V1 across genotypes (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The wt values of the measurements were again defined as 100%. The overall shapes of the two HO marker gene domains were similar and the sizes larger in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains compared with wt brains (<i>Cdh8</i>- HO: 145.7 \u00b1 6.4%, p = 0.0015; <i>Lmo4</i>- HO: 144.9 \u00b1 3.8%, p = 0.00157). The analysis of different area-specific sets of marker genes, either showing unique expression in V1, or discernable expression levels between visual areas, revealed an increase in visually-related HO in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains that was proportionate to the V1 size increase. The extrastriate areas that we have identified on the basis of 5HT staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) included the RSC, which is not a higher order visual area (<a href=\"#bib7\">Garrett et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Marshel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Vann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>) raising the possibility that only related primary and higher order areas (e.g. vision) could scale proportionately. To test this possibility, we have used WMISH of <i>Lypd1</i> on P7 wt and <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains as a specific marker labeling the caudomedial cortex, where the RSC is located (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Constitutive <i>Emx2</i> mutant mice have an overall smaller brain and visual cortex, but homozygous mutants die perinatally (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bishop et al., 2000</a>), preventing the analysis of cortical areas, which arise at later stages. To overcome this limitation, we generated a novel mouse line with floxed <i>Emx2</i> alleles (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), allowing conditional inactivation of <i>Emx2</i>.

By using mouse models with bi-directional changes of V1 size as a model, our study revealed that higher order areas scale linearly together with their related primary sensory areas, This observation is important for at least two reasons: (i) it re-emphasizes a sequential model of primary sensory area formation that likewise influences the properties of related higher order areas. In this model, cortical intrinsic mechanisms specify all generic primary and higher order visual cortex properties during early development. Much later during postnatal development, geniculocortical input is needed to terminally differentiate the genetic distinctions between V1 and HO (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Vue et al., 2013</a>). (ii) It contradicts the hypothesis that cortical structure/function evolution mainly is driven by a disproportionate increase in the size of related higher order areas relative to primary areas. To the contrary, our results show that primary and related higher order areas remain proportionate when primary area size is altered through genetic mechanisms, suggesting that an increase in the complexity of connections and micro-circuits among higher order cortical processing centers likely accounts for gains in cortical functions that are characteristic for gyrencephalic mammals with larger cortical surface areas, compared to simpler lissencephalic mammals. In summary, the newly discovered linear scaling relationship between primary and related higher order areas has major implications for the basic understanding of the development and organization of the neocortical bauplan and its evolution and variability in normal and affected conditions."

Positive clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts at the Salk Transgenic Core Facility and chimeras were mated to C57BL/6J females to obtain germline transmission. Heterozygous mice were mated with mice expressing <i>FLPe</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2000</a>) to remove the neo cassette and then mated to obtain homozygous <i>Emx2fl/fl mice</i>. Cortex specific deletion of <i>Emx2 (cKO</i>) was obtained by crossing <i>Emx2fl/fl</i> mice with <i>Emx1-IRES-Cre</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gorski et al., 2002</a>). Specificity of <i>Emx1-IRES-Cre</i>-mediated deletion of <i>Emx2</i> floxed alleles was analyzed by WMISH\u00a0(described below) staining using a full-length <i>Emx2</i> antisense RNA probe on E11 embryos. Genotyping was performed using primers for <i>Emx2</i> floxed alleles (<i>Emx2</i> forward: GAC-TCC-TTT-CCC-AAA-TAA-CCC-C, <i>Emx2</i> reverse: GTA-AGC-GGG-CGG-GGA-CTG-GTT-C) and for the <i>Cre</i> recombinase (cre forward: GCT-AAA-CAT-GCT-TCA-TCG-TCG-G, cre reverse: GAT-CTC-CGG-TAT-TGA-AAC-TCC-AGC), and the <i>ne-Emx2</i> transgene (nestin forward: TCA-ACC-CCT-AAA-AGC-TCC, Emx2 reverse: GGA-CGG-AGA-GAA-GGC-GGT)."

Antisense RNA probes were labeled using a DIG-RNA labeling kit (Roche,\u00a0Switzerland). ISH on 18-\u03bcm cryostat sections and WMISH using P7 brains were carried out as previously described (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hamasaki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Zembrzycki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Zembrzycki et al., 2015</a>). For tangential cortical sections, cortical hemispheres were dissected, flattened, postfixed between slide glasses, and then cryoprotected. Tangential sections were cut into 40-\u03bcm slices from flattened cortical hemispheres with a sliding microtome and then they were immunostained for Serotonin (5HT, ImmunoStar, Hudson, WI). Immunostaining was developed using the diaminobenzidine colorimetric reaction and the Vectastain kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). For Nissl staining, sections were stained with 0.5% cresyl violet and then dehydrated with graded alcohols."

Another related reservation is the lack of evidence for reliable areal parcellation. Although the experimental design of manipulating the size of V1 is clever and elegant, without reliable parcellation of the cortex, the results fall short of being convincing to demonstrate that the size of V1 is scaled and that there is a clear cause and effect between a change in the size of V1 and the size of neighboring higher order areas."

Hence, there are two different criteria used to define HO in the manuscript.

Previous review suggested there was not enough evidence for such a conclusion, and pointed to an alternate interpretation: genetic factors intrinsic to cortex control the size of both V1 and HO areas in coordination.

The detailed reply indicates that the authors clearly understood the critique and made a number of revisions in the figures and the text that significantly improved the manuscript. Although V1 and the organization of surrounding cortex are beautifully illustrated in several newly added images, there are remaining concerns that the revision failed to analyze the outstanding material in a consistent fashion. This impression is based on the inexplicable discrepancy of the definition of HO shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, which indicates that the authors are unsure how to subdivide the real estate. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> it appears that the border of HO runs from the anterior tip of retrosplenial cortex along the posterior border of S1, continues along the border of auditory cortex and ends by intersecting the rhinal fissure. This does not fit the scheme shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, in which HO does not extend to the border of auditory cortex and does not include retrosplenial cortex. If I understand this correctly, HO in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> is clearly smaller than in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and does not include ventral posterior temporal cortex nor does it include retrosplenial cortex. In fact, HO <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> is what was measured in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Maybe these discrepancies were simply an oversight which can be easily corrected. But the lapse heightened my concerns that the size of HO was inconsistently assessed (e.g. in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> the border of <i>Cdh8</i>-expression in wt is much more medial than indicated and differs from the border in <i>ne-Emx2</i>) and that the substance of the paper is less solid than suggested by the graphs shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. I recommend re-analyzing the material with a more critical eye on the detailed borders of HO. I am sure that the authors are acutely aware that details matter a lot more in small than large brains."

In general in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, we introduce V1 along with the other cortical areas on the basis of 5HT staining that labels thalamocortical input, with area-specific marker genes like <i>Rorb</i> and by using functional imaging. All of these approaches have been used in many studies from many different labs over many years with consistent results. We feel, for example, that there is no doubt that the triangular-shaped 5HT domain in the caudal cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) is V1. Similarly, we do not hesitate to state that the functional imaging maps (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) reveal V1 and its topography. To address the reviewer\u2019s concern, we have added 5HT images showing the entire cortical hemisphere into <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> to better illustrate the location of V1 and all the other apparent cortical areas and regions on the entire cortical sheet. This now demonstrates much more clearly where, for example, the border between neocortex and entorhinal cortex is located and that 5HT staining is not apparent in the retrosplenial cortex. On the adjacent higher magnification images, we then demonstrate that extrastriate areas including retrosplenial cortex appear enlarged in <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains qualitatively. We have revised the text accordingly to implement this information and to better define HO (paragraph one, Results)."

However, we do not think that such artifacts have a major influence on the conclusions of our study for several reasons. Except for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, we mostly use sagittal sections or un-sectioned whole-mount brains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This is especially true for the quantifications of V1 and HO that were exclusively derived from images of unsectioned whole brains. In all other instances where we use flattened cortical sections, we only make qualitative claims about the relative area proportions (e.g. V1 is bigger or smaller). We emphasize that all specimens were processed identically which suggests that possible artifacts would affect control and experimental cases equally, still allowing comparisons between brains. For example, it is very common that the staining of the auditory areas using 5HT staining on flattened sections is a bit fuzzy, while area borders more medially in the cortex are almost always very sharp (e.g. barrels). As we all know the auditory area borders are in reality as sharp as the borders of the more medially located areas. This phenomenon is due to the curvature of the cortex that is highest laterally in the cortex, where auditory areas are located. Flattening artifacts are therefore strongest laterally, where the cortex is curved the most, which consistently results in somewhat fuzzy staining around the lateral most cortical edge. Fuzzy borders of the auditory areas are indeed apparent in flattened sections in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. Importantly the fuzziness of the staining still allows for reliable delineation of the auditory areas, and the staining is comparable between wt and <i>ne-Emx2</i> sections. Further, we compare the quantification of V1 gene markers using un-sectioned whole brains with quantification of V1 derived from 5HT-stained flattened tangential sections (paragraphs six and nine, Results). The quantified sizes of the 5HT-stained V1 were in all cases very similar to the quantifications using marker genes, suggesting that the flattening and staining procure used in this study delivered reproducible results and contained no major artifacts due to the flattening procedure. To emphasize this point more clearly, we have moved the images and graphs of the quantified 5HT-stained flattened sections that were originally figure supplements into <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, respectively. Overall we believe that the use of whole-mount and well as sectioned data excludes the possibility that flattening artifacts alter the interpretation of our findings and our conclusions."

For this purpose, we use a panel of marker genes that either shows expression domains in V1 alone (Unc5d, Igfbp5) or also in HO (<i>Lmo4, Cad8</i>). All of the reported marker genes have been used successfully in previous studies to assess the size and location of primary areas including V1 (Cholfin and Rubenstein 2007, Chou et al. 2013, Hamasaki et al. 2004, Leingartner et al. 2003, Leingartner et al. 2007, Zembrzycki et al. 2015). Our study is novel in introducing <i>Lmo4</i> and <i>Cad8</i> as markers that also can be used to delineate and to quantify HO. We acknowledge that the reviewer\u2019s comment in this regard was appropriate for the original manuscript. We have therefore added a new figure supplement (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) to the manuscript that better illustrates and identifies area borders on the basis of <i>Lmo4</i> and <i>Cad8</i> expression in wt and <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains. In this new figure we show whole brains in dorsal view that were stained in situ for <i>Cad8</i> or <i>Lmo4</i>. We present two sets of images for wt and <i>ne-Emx2</i> brains: One showing the raw images and another set showing the in situ images with superimposed annotated area borders on the basis of the marker gene expression domains. We think that these images much better illustrate how area borders were identified and used in this study to quantify V1 and HO sizes in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. In addition to the representative cases that are shown on higher magnification in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, the new figure supplement provides the reader with an additional set of marker gene-stained whole brains that show comparable area outlines on the basis of marker gene expression domains.

In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, we define primary sensory areas and major cortical subdivisions on the basis of 5HT staining on flattened sections of the cortical hemisphere. 5HT is strongly expressed in primary areas V1, S1, auditory areas. A clear change to much lower 5HT staining in the entorhinal cortex makes it possible to identify the border between neocortex and entorhinal cortex laterally. The caudomedial cortical pole is devoid of 5HT staining; hence no distinction between higher order visual areas around V1 and the retrosplenial cortex around the cortical midline can be made on the basis of 5HT staining. Therefore in the qualitative assessment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) of the region that lies outside of the primary sensory areas, the retrosplenial cortex is included.

This impression is based on the inexplicable discrepancy of the definition of HO shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, which indicates that the authors are unsure how to subdivide the real estate. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> it appears that the border of HO runs from the anterior tip of retrosplenial cortex along the posterior border of S1, continues along the border of auditory cortex and ends by intersecting the rhinal fissure. This does not fit the scheme shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, in which HO does not extend to the border of auditory cortex and does not include retrosplenial cortex. If I understand this correctly, HO in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> is clearly smaller than in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and does not include ventral posterior temporal cortex nor does it include retrosplenial cortex. In fact, HO <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> is what was measured in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Maybe these discrepancies were simply an oversight which can be easily corrected. But the lapse heightened my concerns that the size of HO was inconsistently assessed (e.g. in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> the border of Cdh8-expression in wt is much more medial than indicated and differs from the border in ne-Emx2) and that the substance of the paper is less solid than suggested by the graphs shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>.

It is clearly evident in the image that the Cdh8 expression includes a wedge medial to V1 which extends to the tip of the arrow head. A similar adjustment of the medial border is necessary for ne-Emx2 Cdh8 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The same revisions are necessary in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> in which the medial borders of Cdh8 expression in wt and cKO are more medial than indicated.</i> "

                    "text": "We would like to acknowledge that the reviewer has an exceptional eye and commitment to detail. We agree that around the area in question (around arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), there is some <i>Cdh8</i> staining detectable. However, we would like to mention that this gene expression domain shows much lower staining compared to the outlined complex of all the other regions around V1 that we have quantified (please re-examine <i>Cdh8</i> whole brain images in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We have mentioned this issue consistently in all previous versions of the manuscript as a discernable difference between the expression domains of <i>Lmo4</i> and <i>Cdh8</i> (arrows in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, see paragraph seven, Results): Due to much lower expression compared to all the other more lateral regions around V1 (e.g. <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), we have excluded this domain from the measurements and consistently from the outlines. Due to these criteria we think that the present outlines are well defined on the basis of similarly high <i>Cdh8</i> gene expression levels, compared to detectable but much lower levels in the region of question. We feel that modifying the outlines to include this area of lower <i>Cdh8</i> expression could potentially appear inconsistent to potential readers and would also require us to comment on this issue and criteria (that compared to as is, would not be based on similarly high <i>Cdh8</i> expression levels) in much more detail in the text. Since this issue has always been well documented (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and mentioned in the text (paragraph seven, Results) by comparing <i>Lmo4</i> and <i>Cdh8</i> expression levels in this region, we have the impression that altering the outlines would not be beneficial. To the contrary, it would require us to re-define gene expressions areas without adding additional insights to the conclusions of the manuscript. We have revised the text slightly for clarity to emphasize more progressively that the excluded region does in fact expresses <i>Cdh8</i>, but at much lower levels, compare to the outlined and defined area complex of consistently much higher <i>Cdh8</i> gene expression (paragraph seven, Results)."
