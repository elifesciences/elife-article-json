We analyzed the tight association of <i>Drosophila sechellia</i> to its sole host, the fruit of <i>Morinda citrifolia</i>, which is toxic to other members of the <i>melanogaster</i> species group. Molecular polymorphisms in the dopamine regulatory protein Catsup cause infertility in <i>D. sechellia</i> due to maternal arrest of oogenesis. In its natural host, the fruit compensates for the impaired maternal dopamine metabolism with the precursor <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA, resuming oogenesis and stimulating egg production. <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA present in morinda additionally increases the size of <i>D. sechellia</i> eggs, what in turn enhances early fitness. We argue that the need of <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA for successful reproduction has driven <i>D. sechellia</i> to become an <i>M. citrifolia</i> obligate specialist. This study illustrates how an insect's dopaminergic system can sustain ecological adaptations by modulating ontogenesis and development."

We analyzed the tight association of <i>Drosophila sechellia</i> to its sole host, the fruit of <i>Morinda citrifolia</i>, which is toxic to other members of the <i>melanogaster</i> species group. Molecular polymorphisms in the dopamine regulatory protein Catsup cause infertility in <i>D. sechellia</i> due to maternal arrest of oogenesis. In its natural host, the fruit compensates for the impaired maternal dopamine metabolism with the precursor <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA, resuming oogenesis and stimulating egg production. <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA present in morinda additionally increases the size of <i>D. sechellia</i> eggs, what in turn enhances early fitness. We argue that the need of <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA for successful reproduction has driven <i>D. sechellia</i> to become an <i>M. citrifolia</i> obligate specialist. This study illustrates how an insect's dopaminergic system can sustain ecological adaptations by modulating ontogenesis and development."

A peculiar aspect of the specialization is that morinda fruits are toxic to all other drosophilids (<a href=\"#bib24\">Legal et al., 1992</a>). The toxicity stems from a high content of carboxylic acids (primarily octanoic and hexanoic acid) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Legal et al., 1994</a>), to which <i>D. sechellia</i> appears to be resistant (<a href=\"#bib11\">Farine et al., 1996</a>). The chemosensory system of <i>D. sechellia</i> is specialized in detecting and coding key volatiles produced by morinda (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dekker et al., 2006</a>) while devoid of the repellence towards the acids (<a href=\"#bib30\">Matsuo et al., 2007</a>). On the other hand, <i>D. sechellia</i> females exhibit a low reproductive potential, partly because of a low ovariole number and partly because of fairly low egg production (<a href=\"#bib38\">R'Kha et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">R'kha et al., 1997</a>), making it difficult to raise <i>D. sechellia</i> under laboratory conditions. In turn, morinda stimulates egg production (<a href=\"#bib39\">R'kha et al., 1997</a>), and <i>D. sechellia</i> clearly prefers to oviposit in medium containing morinda carboxylic acids (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amlou et al., 1998</a>). On its host, <i>D. sechellia</i> increases expression of genes involved with oogenesis and fatty acid metabolism (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dworkin and Jones, 2009</a>). Thus, we here examined the dependence of <i>Drosophila sechellia</i> on morinda, for optimal reproduction."

We therefore considered if maternal effects sustained the evolutionary process that has driven the specialization of <i>D. sechellia</i>. Results enhance our understanding of the reproductive behaviour of <i>Drosophila</i> and suggest an ontogenetic mechanism of insect adaptation to a toxic host."

We raised two geographically different populations of <i>D. sechellia</i> on standard <i>Drosophila</i> cornmeal medium (standard diet), on morinda fruit (morinda diet), or on a non-host fruit (banana diet). For comparison, we also raised two strains of <i>D. melanogaster</i> (wild-type Berlin and Canton-S) on the same media (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). To score the rate of egg production, we transferred the flies to oviposition cages containing agar plates devoid of oviposition stimuli (i.e., yeast or morinda carboxylic acids). In agreement with previous reports, <i>D. sechellia</i> raised on standard diet produced few eggs compared to <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin and <i>D. melanogaster</i> Canton-S (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), raised on the same media. The addition of morinda carboxylic acids to the standard diet did not increase egg production in <i>D. sechellia</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). <i>D. sechellia</i> raised on a non-host fruit (banana diet) showed a slight increase in the number of eggs laid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), but this number did not increase further with the addition of morinda carboxylic acids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). <i>D. sechellia</i> raised on morinda diet, however, showed a sixfold increase in egg production (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Morinda diet did not affect the number of eggs produced by <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin and slightly reduced those of <i>D. melanogaster</i> Canton-S (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), as did the addition of morinda carboxylic acids to the standard diet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Banana, however, tripled egg production in <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This increase could be inhibited by the addition of morinda carboxylic acids to the banana (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These results demonstrate that the presence of a natural host modulates the reproductive capacity of <i>Drosophila</i>. In particular, morinda has a strong effect on <i>D. sechellia</i> egg production that goes beyond the reported stimulatory effect of the carboxylic acids on oviposition (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amlou et al., 1998</a>)."

The germarium in each ovariole continuously produces oocyte-cysts, each composed of 15 nurse cells and one oocyte, surrounded by a layer of follicular cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Each oocyte-cyst follows 14 stereotypical consecutive stages of pre-vitellogenic (S1\u2013S7) and vitellogenic (S8\u2013S14) growth, each easily distinguishable by morphological criteria (<a href=\"#bib42\">Spradling et al., 1997</a>). Mated <i>D. melanogaster</i> females typically exhibit multiple ovarioles carrying vitellogenic cysts (<a href=\"#bib42\">Spradling et al., 1997</a>). Females of <i>D. sechellia</i> had cysts normally composed of 15 nurse cells and one oocyte, surrounded by follicular cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Kept on standard diet, mated <i>D. sechellia</i> held oocytes in early developmental stages (<s8) (<a=\"\" href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</s8)>) with few ovarioles, if any, carrying vitellogenic cyst (&gt;S8), what resulted in a significantly lowered rate of vitellogenesis (calculated as &gt;S8/<s8) <i=\"\" in=\"\">D. sechellia</s8)> compared to <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The low number of ovarioles in <i>D. sechellia</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">R'kha et al., 1997</a>) was reflected in the low number of total cysts compared to in <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The halt in oocyte development explains the low production of eggs in <i>D. sechellia</i> raised on standard diet. <i>D. sechellia</i> fed on morinda diet showed a significantly increased vitellogenesis rate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Adding the morinda carboxylic acids, however, had no effect on vitellogenesis in <i>D. sechellia</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We thus conclude that <i>D. sechellia</i> requires components of the morinda fruit other than just the carboxylic acids to induce vitellogenesis and increase egg production."

To analyze if apoptosis occurs in <i>D. sechellia</i>, we stained live ovaries with the vital dye acridine orange (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arama and Steller, 2006</a>). Flies fed a standard diet showed massive apoptosis occurring at S7/S8 cysts, and to a lesser extent in region-2/3 of the germarium (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); suggesting that apoptosis could be the reason for the depressed oviposition on standard media. On the other hand, <i>D. sechellia</i> flies fed a morinda diet showed strikingly few apoptotic cysts (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), in line with the stimulatory effect of morinda in egg-production. Low food availability can trigger the mid-oogenesis checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib46\">Terashima and Bownes, 2004</a>). Thus, we asked if the observed apoptosis in <i>D. sechellia</i> raised on standard diet was a consequence of starvation or aberrant feeding behaviour. In fact, <i>D. sechellia</i> adults raised on the standard diet showed slightly higher weights (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and also consumed more food than did flies raised on morinda diet (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Moreover, genes involved in DA differentiation were shown differentially expressed in <i>D. sechellia</i> compared to the generalists species <i>D. melanogaster</i> and the sister <i>Drosophila simulans</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dworkin and Jones, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wurmser et al., 2011</a>). Accordingly, we wondered if <i>D. sechellia</i> suffers from a DA deficiency.

The preservation of <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA is likely due to the high carboxylic acid content\u2014octanoic and hexanoic acids have been shown to inhibit diphenol oxidase activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2010</a>)\u2014and the ensuing low pH of the fruit (4.1 \u00b1 0.1 [<i>N</i> = 7] and 3.6 \u00b1 0.1 [<i>N</i> = 5] [mean \u00b1 s.e.m.], ripe and overripe morinda, respectively; for comparison, 5.7 \u00b1 0.2 [mean \u00b1 s.e.m.], [<i>N</i> = 4], ripe banana; p = 0.0001; one-way ANOVA), known for its antioxidant properties.

Notably, DA in banana is synthesized directly from TA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Deacon and Marsh, 1971</a>) and not via synthesis of <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA. Presumably, the absence of <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA in banana renders this non-host fruit unable to stimulate egg production in <i>D. sechellia</i> (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

To address this question, we depleted levels of <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA in morinda by pre-incubating fruit pulp with catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT, 2.5 U/g morinda), an enzyme that catabolises <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA into an unusable product (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gordonsmith et al., 1982</a>). Treatment with COMT suppressed the anti-apoptotic effects of morinda (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and hindered the fruit from stimulating vitellogenesis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and egg production in <i>D. sechellia</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), reducing the number of eggs to levels in a standard diet (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Additionally, we added \u03b1-methyl-DOPA (mDp, 0.4 mM), a non-hydrolysable <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA analogue and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dopa decarboxylase that converts <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA into DA, separately to the fruit. The presence of mDp in morinda strongly reduced egg production (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>); feeding a corresponding mDp-supplemented diet to <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin did not have such an effect (not shown). Notably, mDp in the fruit did not hinder oogenesis; instead, eggs were retained in the ovaries (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This halt in ovulation was completely reversed one day after flies were moved to fresh medium (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and, remarkably, oviposition was significantly enhanced when morinda was offered as an oviposition substrate (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We conclude that morinda contains <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA and that its presence in the fruit pulp is both sufficient and necessary to stimulate egg production in <i>D. sechellia</i>."

Although providing a critical chemical, the acidity of the fruit, which helps preserve <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA by preventing oxidisation, creates a hostile environment for the eggs to develop in. How do flies ensure that the eggs survive in this toxic environment? An interesting observation provides one clue. Eggs of <i>D. sechellia</i> are characteristically large compared to those of sibling species <i>D. melanogaster</i>, <i>D. simulans</i>, <i>Drosophila ananassae</i>, <i>Drosophila erecta</i>, <i>Drosophila mojavensis</i>, <i>Drosophila persimilis</i>, <i>Drosophila pseudoobscura</i>, <i>Drosophila virilis</i>, <i>Drosophila willistoni</i> and <i>Drosophila yakuba</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Markow et al., 2009</a>). In accordance, we observed <i>D. sechellia</i> eggs to be 45% larger in size compared to eggs of <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), in a standard diet condition. Upon being fed a morinda diet, eggs of <i>D. sechellia</i> increased in volume twofold compared to eggs of conspecifics fed standard medium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); the resulting eggs had an almost threefold larger volume than did <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin eggs in standard conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This effect could be replicated by supplementing standard diet with <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA or, notably, DA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). On the other hand, adding COMT or mDp to a morinda diet prevented the fruit from having any effect on the volume of eggs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results indicate that egg size is also under a dopaminergic control regime during egg development. The increased size may provide buffering capacity to the eggs, helping them to cope with the toxic environment of the host. Indeed, the hatching rate of eggs transferred onto a morinda-containing medium was significantly higher in the enlarged eggs of flies fed morinda than in the smaller eggs of individuals fed only standard medium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The low number of ovarioles of <i>D. sechellia</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">R'kha et al., 1997</a>) thus seems to be a result of a trade-off between number and size (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), favouring the enlarged eggs of females fed morinda."

Furthermore, <i>D. melanogaster</i> DGRP-357 produced fewer eggs than did <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>), and the ovariole rate of egg production in <i>D. melanogaster</i> DGRP-357 females did not differ significantly from that of <i>D. sechellia</i> (p = 0.2104; Student's <i>t</i> test). To control for non-identified gene mutations present in <i>D. melanogaster</i> DGRP-357 that could contribute to lowering egg production, we generated heteroallelic flies carrying <i>Catsup</i><sup><i>In270Del</i></sup> in trans-heterozygosis with the null <i>Catsup</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> allele (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stathakis et al., 1999</a>). <i>Catsup</i><sup><i>In270Del</i></sup>/<i>Catsup</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> females displayed significantly decreased egg production, below that of <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin and parental lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>), that could be rescued by feeding the flies a standard diet supplemented with <span class=\"small-caps\">l</span>-DOPA (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In sum, these results show that <i>D. melanogaster</i> flies carrying a <i>D. sechellia Catsup</i>-like allele mirror <i>D. sechellia's</i> low production of eggs."

CATSUP was expressed in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum- and golgi-like cisternae of the nurse cells of S8 oocyte cysts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), what results a suitable intracellular distribution for a protein with traffic nurse-to-oocyte function.

In non-<i>sechellia</i> Drosophilids, morinda acids toxicity is mostly manifested as locomotion disorders followed by slowness in movement until complete immobilization and death (<a href=\"#bib24\">Legal et al., 1992</a>). These behavioral phenotypes resemble the neurotoxic effects described in <i>Drosophila</i> upon exposure to fungal-derived organic volatiles of similar chemical structure to morinda carboxylic acids (<a href=\"#bib16\">Inamdar and Bennett, 2014</a>), which have been portrayed as reducing DA in the flies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Inamdar et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we asked if incrementing DA could aid the adult flies in overcoming the behavioral effects of morinda carboxylic acids. To test this, we fed adult <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin a synthetic diet supplemented with increasingly amounts of DA and tested their survival upon exposure to morinda carboxylic acids. After a few minutes of experiencing a natural concentration mix of octanoic and hexanoic acids, <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin flies fed a standard diet showed general restlessness and altered equilibrium with incorrect positioning of tarsi, followed by slowness in movement until complete immobilization. A 66% of females (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and 53% of males (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) were completely immobilized after 120 min of exposure to the mix of acids. Dietary administration of DA declined the locomotion behavioral effects of morinda carboxylic acids in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin flies (females and males) treated with 100 mg/ml DA reached a survival degree not significantly different from that of <i>D. sechellia</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). These results suggest that the endogenously increased DA levels in <i>D. sechellia</i> (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) contribute to override the behavioral effects of morinda carboxylic acids. On the other hand, DGRP-357 flies\u2014of intermediate DA levels (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)\u2014showed <i>D. melanogaster</i> levels of resistance to morinda (41.2 \u00b1 4.7 and 52.5 \u00b1 2.8% survival in morinda, respectively in DGRP-357 [<i>N</i> = 6] and <i>D. melanogaster</i> wild-type Berlin [<i>N</i> = 4]; p = 0.09 using Student's <i>t</i> test), suggesting that further genes might contribute to elevate the levels of DA in <i>D. sechellia</i>. <i>D. sechellia</i> shows protein levels of TH-PLE, the rate limiting enzyme in DA production, higher than in the sister species <i>D. simulans</i> and <i>D. mauritiana</i>, and in wild type <i>D. melanogaster</i> (wild-type Berlin, CS) and DGRP-357 (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, in a screen for genes that differ in expression between <i>D. sechellia</i> and four geographically distinct populations of its generalist sister species <i>D. simulans</i>, <a href=\"#bib49\">Wurmser et al. (2011)</a> showed lower expression of the DA catabolic enzyme (<i>Dopamine-N-acetyltransferase</i>), what probably contributes to almost quintuplicate DA in <i>D. sechellia</i> (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

We propose an evolutionary scenario in which an initial mutation in <i>D. sechellia</i> DA metabolism caused impaired female fertility and fecundity, but concomitantly provided eggs and adults with resistance to morinda toxic acids. Together with an early loss of repellence (<a href=\"#bib30\">Matsuo et al., 2007</a>), this initial maternally inherited tolerance allowed individuals to develop in morinda and feed the DA precursor, particularly enriched in this fruit, which strongly increased adult female fertility. In turn, the lack of repellence (<a href=\"#bib30\">Matsuo et al., 2007</a>), and instead the strong attraction to morinda volatiles (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dekker et al., 2006</a>), combined with the beneficial morinda effect on ovulation and egg laying (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), shaped <i>D. sechellia</i>'s preference to oviposit in its natural host (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amlou et al., 1998</a>)."

The locomotion behaviour was scored in groups of 30 females and 30 males kept in cages (37.5 mm diameter and 58 mm high) holding agar plates containing 5% sucrose and a mix of 0.07% vol/V 3:1 octanoic:hexanoic acids. <i>M. citrifolia</i> fruits contain highly volatile compounds that confer toxicity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Legal et al., 1994</a>), with the two most abundant being octanoic acid (58%) and hexanoic acid (19.24%) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Farine et al., 1996</a>). Octanoic acid is the most toxic compound in the ripe fruit (<a href=\"#bib25\">Legal et al., 1994</a>), which <i>D. sechellia</i> has been able to overcome by the development of both larval and adult tolerance mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib38\">R'Kha et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Legal et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amlou et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jones, 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2005</a>). Given these observations, the ratio provided on par. A drop of fresh yeast was added to the plates forcing the attracted flies to enter in contact to the acids. Flies were carefully observed under a stereoscope and the number of immobilized flies was recorded every 5 min independently for females and males. Results are the mean of three to five independent determinations in each food condition."

Alternatively, some other method of detecting apoptosis, like TUNEL or activated caspase staining could be used to determine whether an oogenesis checkpoint has been triggered. Subsequently, demonstrating that apoptosis is no longer present when the flies are raised on Morinda fruit is also necessary. This is required because stressors can cause egg chambers in the ovaries to be eliminated by apoptosis at oogenesis checkpoints in region-2/3 of the germarium or stage 7/8 egg chambers (the mid-oogenesis checkpoint) (Drummond-Barbosa 2001; McCall 2004), which could be a possible explanation for the deceased egg numbers."

This question assumes the assay was performed in a cylindrical tube. Was it performed on a Petri dish where distance of the fly from the food would not be an issue? Please clarify and comment."
