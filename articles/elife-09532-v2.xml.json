Using <i>Escherichia coli</i> CcdB as the test case, we describe an experimental method termed saturation-suppressor mutagenesis to acquire residue contact information. In this methodology, for each of five inactive CcdB mutants, exhaustive screens for suppressors were performed. Proximal suppressors were accurately discriminated from distal suppressors based on their phenotypes when present as single mutants. Experimentally identified putative proximal pairs formed spatial constraints to recover &gt;98% of native-like models of CcdB from a decoy dataset. Suppressor methodology was also applied to the integral membrane protein, diacylglycerol kinase A where the structures determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR were significantly different. Suppressor as well as sequence co-variation data clearly point to the X-ray structure being the functional one adopted <i>in vivo</i>. The methodology is applicable to any macromolecular system for which a convenient phenotypic assay exists."

Using <i>Escherichia coli</i> CcdB as the test case, we describe an experimental method termed saturation-suppressor mutagenesis to acquire residue contact information. In this methodology, for each of five inactive CcdB mutants, exhaustive screens for suppressors were performed. Proximal suppressors were accurately discriminated from distal suppressors based on their phenotypes when present as single mutants. Experimentally identified putative proximal pairs formed spatial constraints to recover &gt;98% of native-like models of CcdB from a decoy dataset. Suppressor methodology was also applied to the integral membrane protein, diacylglycerol kinase A where the structures determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR were significantly different. Suppressor as well as sequence co-variation data clearly point to the X-ray structure being the functional one adopted <i>in vivo</i>. The methodology is applicable to any macromolecular system for which a convenient phenotypic assay exists."

Now, Sahoo et al. \u2013 who include two of the researchers involved in the 2012 work \u2013 have developed an experimental method to identify contacting amino acids and use the CcdB protein as a test case. The approach involved searching for additional mutations that could restore the activity of five of the original mutant proteins when the proteins were produced in yeast cells. The rationale was that any secondary mutations that restored the activity must have corrected the folding defect caused by the original mutation. Sahoo et al. then predicted how close the amino acids affected by the secondary mutations were to the amino acids altered by the original mutations. This information was used to select reliable three-dimensional models of CcdB from a large set of possible structures that had been generated previously using computer models."

The structure of this protein had previously been inferred using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance, but there was a mismatch between the two methods. Sahoo et al. found that the amino acid contacts derived from their experimental method matched those found in the crystal structure, suggesting that the functional protein structure in living cells is similar to the crystal structure. In the future, the experimental approach developed in this work could be combined with existing methods to reliably guide protein structure prediction."

X-ray crystallography, NMR and more recently Cryo-EM (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bartesaghi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cheng, 2015</a>) are the major techniques used to accomplish this at atomic resolution. However, these require soluble purified protein at high concentration. In a few cases (<a href=\"#bib26\">Garbuzynskiy et al., 2005</a>), the structures solved by different methods do not agree with each other, for various reasons. In many cases, the folded conformation is believed to be at a global free energy minimum (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anfinsen, 1973</a>).

The fitness cost of most amino acid substitutions depends on the genetic context in which they occur. Substitutions beneficial in one background can be detrimental in a different background (<a href=\"#bib14\">Breen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Shah et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, some sites are conserved not because a given amino acid is functionally irreplaceable, but rather because the right context is not available for its evolution (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wellner et al., 2013</a>). This provides further evidence of correlation amongst mutations, that is epistatic interactions."

Although these methods show great promise in the area of macromolecular structure determination, the fidelity of the predictions is questionable for candidates with small protein families, where the total number of sequences is less than five times the length of the protein in case of GREMLIN (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kamisetty et al., 2013</a>) or less than 1000 for some of the other methods (<a href=\"#bib53\">Morcos et al., 2011</a>).

Next, exhaustive second-site saturation mutagenesis libraries constructed in the background of each inactive mutant were displayed on the surface of yeast (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chao et al., 2006</a>) and screened for binding to the CcdB ligand, DNA Gyrase, to identify suppressors.

In addition to differences in mutational sensitivity patterns which are employed here to discriminate between active-site and buried residues, an important difference between active-site and buried mutations is that the former typically affect specific activity and not the level of properly folded protein, while the latter primarily affect the level of properly folded protein (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bajaj et al., 2008</a>). Thus, measurements of protein levels, and possibly sensitivity of mutant activity to chaperone overexpression (<a href=\"#bib77\">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</a>), can also be used to distinguish between active-site and buried mutants. The average hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment (<a href=\"#bib82\">Varadarajan et al., 1996</a>) are supplementary parameters that can help distinguish between exposed, active-site and buried residues."

In order to identify residues which can compensate for the parent inactive mutant, the selected parent inactive mutations described above were individually introduced into the single-site saturation mutagenesis library constructed previously (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adkar et al., 2012</a>). The resulting double mutant saturation-suppressor libraries were cloned into a yeast surface display vector (pPNLS) by three fragment recombination in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Recombination yielded ~10<sup>5</sup> transformants for each library. Yeast surface display (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chao et al., 2006</a>) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) were used as screening tools to isolate populations exhibiting (i) enhanced binding to the ligand DNA Gyrase, and (ii) increased surface expression relative to the corresponding parent inactive mutant. The ligand concentration was decreased in subsequent rounds of sorting to increase the stringency in selection of true suppressors (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The methodology used to generate the library along with the use of very low (pg) amount of template DNA for PCR was effective in introducing the parent inactive mutant into all members of the single-site saturation mutagenesis library. This is important as the presence of even a small fraction of WT residue at the position of the parent inactive mutant will rapidly lead to its selection, resulting in a high amount of false positive data. Following multiple rounds of sorting (typically 3\u20134), over 10% of the population was shown to bind significantly better to DNA Gyrase than the parent inactive mutants. Data for the L83S mutant library is shown (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). At this stage, 96 individual clones for each library were sequenced by Sanger sequencing to identify 1\u20133 potential suppressors for each parent inactive mutant (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Sequencing data obtained was analyzed to identify proximal and distal suppressors (as discussed above). We largely obtained double mutants containing the parent inactive mutant and a suppressor, and a small fraction of the triple mutant (V5F/L36M/A81G) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Occurrence of the triple mutant was due to selection and enrichment of an additional mutation introduced into the double mutant library likely due to PCR based errors. The selected triple mutant contained the parent inactive mutant V5F and two proximal suppressors (L36M and A81G). Overall, six residue pairs were identified, which contained the parent inactive mutant and a putative proximal suppressor (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

The ability of the R10G mutation to suppress defects at other positions was examined by constructing the corresponding double mutants. Increased surface expression of R10G paired with each of V5F, V18W, L36A and L83S was seen relative to the individual parent inactive mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). This demonstrates that R10G likely acts as a global suppressor. E11 suppresses activity of two parent inactive mutants, L36A and V20F (L36A/E11P, V20F/E11R, V20F/E11K) and is anticipated to play a role similar to R10G."

This increase in T<sub>m</sub> was observed for all mutants except R10G. L36A/R10G showed an increase of only 9<sup>o</sup>C in the presence of CcdA while other mutants showed an increase of &gt;20<sup>o</sup>C. These observations indicated a decrease in affinity of R10G CcdB for CcdA. The distal suppressors R10G and E11R are present on an exposed loop of CcdB and contact CcdA in the crystal structure of the CcdB-CcdA complex, PDB id 3G7Z (<a href=\"#bib23\">De Jonge et al., 2009</a>). R10 forms a hydrogen bond (2.9\u00a0\u00c5) with N69 of CcdA. Hence, mutations at R10 and E11 are likely to destabilize binding of CcdB to CcdA, consistent with our results. The suppressor mutant, R10G has an increased stability relative to WT (R10G (T<sub>m</sub>(R10G)=74.8 \u00b1 0.2<sup>o</sup>C, T<sub>m</sub>(WT)=66.8 \u00b1 1.0<sup>o</sup>C, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, the compromised ability to bind to its antitoxin CcdA results in increased toxicity in native contexts where CcdB and CcdA are both present. Thus, to maintain homeostasis in the system, evolutionary pressure defines a trade-off between function and stability of the protein (<a href=\"#bib67\">Schreiber et al., 1994</a>), settling on an optimally stable wild type protein rather than a maximally stable one. This explains why the R to G mutation is not found in naturally occurring CcdB homologs. The screen employed in this work identifies stabilizing variants which are functionally competent to bind to only one of the binding partners, DNA Gyrase, explaining the identification of the R10G like mutation. To understand the molecular mechanism(s) by which R10G rescues L36A present at the core, we examined if any long range functional interaction was predicted between the sites by the program SCA (<a href=\"#bib33\">Halabi et al., 2009</a>). No interaction was seen although this analysis was limited by low sequence diversity of CcdB. Experimentally, we observed that R10G stabilized the WT protein and other parent inactive mutants while the E11R substitution stabilized the parent inactive mutant V20F. The large conformational flexibility of glycine (in case of R10G) might stabilize the loop harboring residue 10 by accessing conformations not accessible to other residues. Further experiments need to be done to understand the mechanism of stabilization of the parent inactive mutant V20F by E11R and to determine if E11R, like R10G also functions as a global suppressor."

The decoy set contained models ranging from 1.9\u201320.4\u00a0\u00c5 (backbone RMSD relative to the crystal structure, PDB id 3VUB [<a href=\"#bib46\">Loris et al., 1999</a>]). The models were scored based on ContactScore, which was defined as the number of times the experimentally identified residue contact pairs (6 pairs) are within a cutoff distance of 7\u00a0\u00c5 of each other in a given model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) (see Materials and methods). ContactScore is an integral value ranging from 0 to 6, as there are six (Parent inactive mutant, proximal suppressor) pairs. Proximal suppressor mutants are likely to have their side chains facing towards the corresponding parent inactive mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013F</a>), and hence, the side chain centroids of the pair are likely to be closer than their corresponding C\u03b1 atoms.

Models satisfying all the experimental constraints that is ContactScore=6 are distributed in the RMSD bin &lt;4\u00a0\u00c5. The distribution progressively shifts towards a higher RMSD range with decrease in the number of constraints being satisfied (ContactScore&lt;6).

Consequently, residues in proximity to each of these residues in the X-ray structure (PDB id 3ZE5 [<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2013</a>]) are distant in the NMR structure (PDB id 2KDC [<a href=\"#bib80\">Van Horn et al., 2009</a>]). Thus by constructing parent inactive mutants at the above positions and isolating corresponding suppressors, it should be possible to determine which of the two structures represents the functional conformation in-vivo. It has previously been shown (<a href=\"#bib64\">Raetz and Newman, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">1979</a>) that cells deleted for <i>dgkA</i> do not grow under conditions of low osmolarity, providing a facile screen for both parent inactive mutants and their corresponding suppressors."

DCA (<a href=\"#bib53\">Morcos et al., 2011</a>), PSICOV (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jones et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Nugent and Jones 2012</a>), GREMLIN (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kamisetty et al., 2013</a>), SCA (<a href=\"#bib33\">Halabi et al., 2009</a>) and EVfold (<a href=\"#bib48\">Marks et al., 2011</a>) analyze co-variation matrix data from a multiple sequence alignment to deduce residues in contact. The methods rank residue pairs based on a co-variation or correlation score specific to each method. The top ranked pairs which typically lie in the top L/2 pairs, where L is the length of the protein sequence (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jones et al., 2012</a>) are predicted to be in contact. The methods perform well when the size of the multiple sequence alignment is large, that is &gt;5L (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kamisetty et al., 2013</a>). DgkA (121 residues per protomer) exhibits large sequence diversity (4175 sequences in the multiple sequence alignment). Putative contact predictions by the above methods were analyzed by calculating sidechain-sidechain centroid distances between the predicted pairs using both X-ray and NMR structures of DgkA. Some high scoring, co-varying pairs predicted by DCA, GREMLIN, PSICOV and EVfold were found to be true contacts (centroid-centroid distance &lt;7\u00a0\u00c5, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) when mapped onto the crystal structure. There were a few high scoring pairs which were either far apart in the X-ray structure (predictions by PSICOV) or were in proximity when analyzed with the NMR structure (predictions by GREMLIN, PSICOV and EVfold). However, overall sequence co-variation data are more consistent with the X-ray structure, in agreement with conclusions from suppressor mutagenesis. Of the six contacts identified from our suppressor analyses (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), three (62\u201341, 67\u2013104, 68\u2013100) were predicted in the top L/2 co-varying pairs by GREMLIN, PSICOV and EVfold (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), only 67\u2013104 was predicted by DCA and none by SCA. This suggests that natural sequence co-variation and suppressor mutagenesis can provide complementary information."

We therefore examined whether \u0394\u0394G calculations could be used to rationalize the identity of the experimentally observed local suppressors. To this end the difference in stability between the (Parent inactive mutant, suppressor) pair and the parent inactive mutant for CcdB mutants was calculated. \u25b3\u25b3G<i><sub>folding</sub> </i>(\u25b3G<i><sub>folding</sub></i>Double mutant<i>-</i>\u25b3G<i><sub>folding</sub></i>Parent inactive mutant) was calculated using Rosetta v3.3 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kellogg et al., 2011</a>). Putative proximal suppressors were considered to arise at residues within 7\u00a0\u00c5 (sidechain\u2013sidechain centroid distance) of the parent inactive mutant. Many stable substituents were predicted (\u25b3\u25b3G<i><sub>folding</sub></i>&lt;0, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). However, amongst the six experimentally identified stable compensatory pairs, only L36A/M63L (\u22123.7 kcal/mol) was predicted to be stable. The remaining five contact pairs were predicted to be either marginally stable or unstable. Several other mutations besides the experimentally determined ones were predicted to be stabilizing for example V5F/L16G, V18W/I90A, V20F/I90A, L36A/V54I and L83S/V18I. These might be present in the earlier rounds of sorting but are lost in later rounds due to stringent sort conditions.\u00a0A marked bias for aromatic substitutions was observed in the predictions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, substitutions underlined in magenta) though such aromatic substitutions were not observed experimentally. Aromatic substitutions are rigid and were found to over pack the cavity created by the parent inactive mutants in the models generated using Rosetta. Further, several of the mutations that were computationally predicted to be highly stabilizing are unlikely to be so as they are not complementary in size to the original parent inactive mutant, for example L36A/W61F, V5F/L16Y, V18W/I90F and V20F/I90F. If aromatic substitutions are excluded, Rosetta predictions using \u0394\u0394G values are in reasonable qualitative agreement with experiment."

The saturation-suppressor mutagenesis methodology described here (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) enabled identification of 8 residues at the hydrophobic core and their pairwise interactions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,F</a>) placing important constraints on packing of the model protein CcdB. Encouragingly, proximal suppressors could be obtained for four of the five parent inactive mutants in the case of CcdB as well as DgkA. There may be mutations in the core which allow the protein to fold but are functionally defective (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Roscoe et al., 2013</a>). We eliminated such mutations as the CcdB screen required variants to both fold into a stable conformation and be functionally active to bind to Gyrase. The experimentally identified residue pairs for CcdB are in physical contact and have suppressor positions common to each other (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This interlinked network of residues restricts the conformational space during folding. The ContactScore metric defined above selects models satisfying the identified spatial constraints. A histogram of recovery of models with respect to backbone RMSD of the models selected by this metric shows a maximum of 100% for models with backbone RMSD &lt;2\u00a0\u00c5, gradually decreasing to 66% for models &lt;4\u00a0\u00c5 and subsequently plateauing to 0% for models &gt;5\u00a0\u00c5, reflecting the sensitivity and accuracy of the parameter. A high recovery is important for protein model discrimination, as typically there will be very few low RMSD models in the candidate set of predictions. The ContactScore metric also performs better than a simpler approach based on deviation of residue accessibilities in a model from their average values in a large dataset of proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bahadur and Chakrabarti, 2009</a>) though an exhaustive comparison with other metrics for model discrimination has not been carried out. The efficiency of model discrimination using the ContactScore metric will likely be a function of quality of the decoy dataset as well as the accuracy of the contacts inferred from suppressor mutagenesis. In a dataset where very few low RMSD models are present or where not all contacts identified are true contacts, the model recovery will be lower than for the CcdB decoy dataset described here. Further, the small number of (Parent inactive mutant, suppressor) pairs identified here will not be sufficient for larger proteins, thereby affecting the model discrimination efficiency. However, most of these limitations can be overcome by identifying a higher number of (Parent inactive mutant, suppressor) pairs for the protein of interest and by combining residue contacts inferred from saturation mutagenesis with other experimental or computational constraints."

Many membrane proteins adopt multiple conformations (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</a>) and membrane mimetics used to solubilize and stabilize membrane proteins can affect their conformations (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cross et al., 2013</a>). There are two reported structures of the integral membrane protein DgkA, one solved by X-ray crystallography (<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2013</a>) and one by solution NMR (<a href=\"#bib80\">Van Horn et al., 2009</a>) which differ significantly from each other. Using our suppressor methodology, we unambiguously identified six residue-residue contacts which were all present in the crystal structure but were spatially distant in the NMR structure. This suggests that the conformation of the protein in the lipidic (monoacylglycerol) cubic phase conditions (used in X-ray crystallography [<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2013</a>]) is the functional conformer in-vivo\u00a0and is not an artifact resulting from the presence of thermostabilizing mutations and minor distortions that might result from crystal contacts. Our results are also consistent with a recent reanalysis of oriented sample solid state NMR data for the protein in liquid crystalline bilayers (<a href=\"#bib54\">Murray et al., 2014</a>) which showed better overall agreement with the crystal than with the solution NMR structure."

As discussed above, buried and active-site residues can be distinguished based on their mutational sensitivity patterns as well as from data on mutant protein levels, sensitivity to chaperone overexpression patterns (<a href=\"#bib77\">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</a>) and residue conservation patterns (<a href=\"#bib51\">Melamed et al., 2015</a>). Distal suppressors are likely to be on the surface (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bank et al., 2015</a>). If the correlation of mutational sensitivity/RankScore with depth seen for CcdB holds for other globular proteins, this should allow distinction of local and global suppressors in such systems, as long as the majority of global suppressors lie on the surface. However, unambiguous distinction between global and local suppressors will likely not always be possible with a limited number of (Parent inactive mutation, suppressor) pairs. Also, in some cases, a single suppressor mutation may not be sufficient to restore the activity of a parent inactive mutant. In such cases, the network of correlating residues will be more complex and additional experimental data will be required to identify a set of mutations which will suppress a parent inactive mutant."

Until such data becomes available it will be challenging to apply this methodology to these systems. In the case of DgkA, we had the much simpler objective of distinguishing between two possible structures. While distinguishing between global and local suppressors maybe more challenging in membrane proteins, given sufficient double mutant data, it should be straightforward because each global suppressor should suppress a much larger number of parent inactive mutants than all local suppressors. The average relative frequency of obtaining proximal versus distal suppressors is currently unknown. If a single-site saturation mutagenesis library is enriched for inactive mutants (Parent inactive mutants), subjected to random mutagenesis and screened for suppressors, the resulting population will be enriched for global suppressors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bershtein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">2008</a>). This is because a global suppressor will suppress multiple parent inactive mutants. However, for a specific parent inactive mutant, it is not obvious that global suppressors will dominate. A recent study examined a library of the 75 amino acid RRM domain of the yeast poly-A binding protein (<a href=\"#bib50\">Melamed et al., 2013</a>). Functional scores for 1246 single and 39,912 double mutants were obtained. Epistatic interactions were enriched for residue pairs with short sequence spacing (&lt;5) and short distance (10\u201315\u00c5). Another recent study reported exhaustive screening of single and double mutants of GB1 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Olson et al., 2014</a>). The majority of pairs displaying positive epistasis had C\u03b2-C\u03b2 distances &lt;8\u00a0\u00c5. Both of the above studies indicate that local suppressors may occur at a higher frequency than global ones with respect to individual parent inactive mutants but more data is required to confirm this."

Although these libraries have high diversity and mutations at multiple residue positions, they typically do not have more than a single base substitution at any codon. It should be noted that single base changes can sample only 39% of all possible amino acid substitutions. Hence, they do not exhaustively sample all possible second-site suppressors for a given inactivating mutation. This is important, since for a given parent inactive mutant there appear to be only a few local suppressors, and these could well be absent in a library generated by conventional random mutagenesis."

These approaches do not work well for proteins like CcdB due to the limited evolutionary diversity in the multiple sequence alignment. Another constraint is that the range of substitutions sampled at a given position during natural evolution is limited by functional and stability constraints, that can be relaxed in a laboratory setting. For the protein DgkA, for which there are several sequences, the results of the five computational approaches to identify co-varying residues were more consistent with the crystal structure of DgkA than with the NMR structure. Several of the contacts identified by our suppressor approach were not identified by the sequence co-variation. Since our experimental strategy identifies only a few (Parent inactive mutant, suppressor), a direct comparison of these results with predictions by computational methods is not possible. However, our approach, provides complementary information to these existing methods, and can be usefully combined with them to guide protein structure prediction. The approach described here uses saturation-suppressor mutagenesis to identify spatially proximal residues. The library generation design adopted here for CcdB, constructs the second-site saturation library in the background of individual inactive mutants chosen from a single-site saturation mutagenesis library comprising of ~1430 mutants of CcdB (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adkar et al., 2012</a>)."

The combination of site-directed mutagenesis or doped oligonucleotide based synthetic library generation strategies with deep sequencing has expanded our understanding of sequence, structure, function relationships (<a href=\"#bib79\">Tripathi and Varadarajan, 2014</a>). High resolution mutational analyses using single-site saturation mutagenesis have facilitated understanding the influence of each residue on a protein\u2019s structure, stability, activity, specificity and fitness (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adkar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fowler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Roscoe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tripathi and Varadarajan, 2014</a>). Expanding this landscape by integrating spatial constraints isolated from paired mutational phenotypes can greatly advance our efforts to construct highly accurate structural models especially where evolutionary information is sparse, because of the paucity of homologous sequences. Unbiased examination of all pairwise mutant combinations is currently not feasible because the large library size cannot easily be sequenced at sufficient depth using deep sequencing (<sup>100</sup>C<sub>2\u00a0</sub>\u00d7\u00a0400 or 2 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>\u00a0for a 100 residue protein [<a href=\"#bib79\">Tripathi and Varadarajan, 2014</a>]). However, with continuous improvements in deep sequencing and mutant generation technologies this is likely to change soon. The methodology outlined here can be similarly applied to any protein or protein complex where mutation can be coupled to a phenotypic readout. In the two systems studied here, we identified intramolecular suppressors of core packing defects, and active-site mutants were excluded from the set of parent inactive mutants. However, a similar approach can be used to obtain structural information on biomolecular protein:protein complexes. In this case, single-site saturation mutagenesis libraries at active-site residues of one partner would be screened against parent inactive mutants located, at active-site residue of the other partner to identify inter-molecular suppressors. These in turn would provide constraints to build structural models of the complex."

Proximal and distal suppressors could be accurately distinguished based on their mutational sensitivity when present as single mutants and all proximal suppressors were in close contact with the corresponding parent inactive mutant. For other systems it remains to be seen how well this approach will work and how many suppressors will be required for accurate model discrimination.

Using this approach it will be possible to compare phenotypes of large numbers of partial loss-of function single mutants and corresponding double mutants. This data will help distinguish local from global suppressors and provide multiple constraints to guide macromolecular structure prediction and determination.

In this background, various single-site mutants were made by three fragment recombination of gapped vector and two overlapping CcdB fragments. PCR to amplify the overlapping fragments of CcdB was carried out with Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) for 15 cycles with 1\u20135\u00a0pg template DNA. pPNLS vector containing a ~1\u00a0kb stuffer sequence was digested with <i>SfiI</i> (New England Biolabs, NEB) to remove the stuffer insert, and gel purified. The digested vector and the two CcdB fragments were transformed by three fragment homologous recombination in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> EBY100 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gietz and Schiestl, 2007</a>). Yeast cells were incubated for 3\u2009hr at 30<sup>o</sup>C in 30 ml YPD broth after transformation.

Binding of chicken anti-HA antibody (SIGMA, 1:300) to the HA tag at the N terminus of CcdB was used to monitor surface expression of the displayed protein. Goat anti-chicken IgG conjugated AlexaFluor-488 (Invitrogen, 1:300) was used as the secondary antibody. The cmyc tag fused to the C terminus of CcdB in the pPNLS vector was removed to enable binding of the ligand Gyrase, which has a 3xFLAG tag at its C terminus. Gyrase binding was assessed by binding of mouse anti-FLAG antibody (SIGMA, 1:300) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated AlexaFluor-633 (Invitrogen, 1:1800) secondary antibody. Approximately\u00a010<sup>7</sup> double-labeled cells from each library were sorted on a BD FACS Aria-III flow cytometer (488\u00a0nm, 633\u00a0nm lasers for excitation and 530/30 nm, 660/20 nm bandpass filters, respectively, for emission) to enrich mutants which show better surface expression and binding than the reference parent inactive mutant. The concentration of Gyrase-3xFLAG used depended on the corresponding affinity of the reference inactive mutant. Equilibrium dissociation constant values (K<sub>d</sub>) for the reference mutants were measured using a yeast surface display titration as described (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chao et al., 2006</a>). Sorting of the libraries was carried out for multiple rounds till (i) analysis of the population grown after the final sort showed at least 10% of the population in a gate which contained 0% of the corresponding parent inactive mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, panel showing L83S-lib after sort3), and (ii) there was no further improvement in signals from the enriched library with subsequent rounds of sort. The stringency of the sort was progressively increased by decreasing the concentration of Gyrase and gating the top ~1% of the population, which largely excluded the reference mutant (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

The NMR structure (PDB id 2KDC) has co-ordinates for 16 poses. For the figures and distances listed in the paper we used only the first pose. However, we calculated the Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF) for each residue (C\u03b1 atom) taking the average structure as the reference structure. Greater fluctuations are observed near the N-terminus of the protein (residues 1 to 33). Hence, we did not consider differential contacts within this region. Since, the region beyond the first 33 residues shows low RMS fluctuations, we report sidechain-sidechain centroid distances for residues showing differential contacts with the parent inactive mutant in the X-ray and the NMR first pose structure. In <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>, we report the closest distance amongst all the 16 poses between each parent inactive mutant and all residues shortlisted in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>."

Each parent inactive mutant was used as template to randomize corresponding potential contact partners using the inverse PCR method discussed above, to construct X-ray and NMR structure specific second-site suppressor mutagenesis libraries. Screening of the libraries was carried out on selective media at varying concentrations of NaCl (mentioned above). Probable suppressors were identified as those which appear before the appearance of the corresponding parent inactive mutant on a plate at low NaCl concentration (&lt;0.15%), that is restore the growth defect of the parent inactive mutant. WT DgkA and the empty vector pBAD-33 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Second-site putative suppressors were identified by Sanger sequencing at Macrogen, Korea. Fresh transformation of individual suppressors into <i>E. coli\u00a0\u0394dgkA</i> strain and comparison of the phenotype with the corresponding parent inactive mutant confirmed the result from the initial screen."

However, some of the contacts identified as unique to one structure are really not at all far away in the other structure \u2013 even though closer in the example given. For instance, the M66-A99 minimum atom distance is 6.7 \u00c5 and 5.5 \u00c5 in the crystal structure 3ZE5 (inter monomers as with the NMR structures) and I67-E34 distance is 5.5 \u00c5 in the crystal structure 3ZE5 within the monomers (inter monomers in NMR structures) \u2013 therefore neither of these contacts is so unique to the NMR structures despite the domain swap, despite the fact they are closer in the crystal. Similarly, though much closer in the crystal, the min atom distance between V62- A41 (between monomers) in one of the NMR structures is 6.3 \u00c5. Therefore, despite the domain swap, many 3D contacts are common to both structures within a looser definition, and therefore it is not clear that one can be sure that the structures are actually discriminated. It would be useful to tabulate the unique contacts with the minimum atom distance in both the structures including the multimeric assemblies."

It was later clear that discriminating structures in those conditions was a quite easy exercise and almost any simple method (i.e. surface exposition prediction) was able to perform well in that type of test.

Second, and very important, since the publications of those prediction methods it was very clear that they can be applied <i>only</i> to rich alignments with thousands of sequences.

The authors should do a more thorough search and reading, to provide an update picture of experimental explorations of covariance, or epistasis, in individual proteins, and specifically, in support of the claim that: \"Though a small number of compensatory mutations were identified, in some cases these were ascertained to be spatially proximal while in others they were distal from the site of the original inactive mutation.\""

Mutational sensitivity (MS<sub>seq</sub>) was determined from the sequencing analysis of the single-site saturation library of CcdB (methodology described in (Adkar et al, 2012)). At buried positions (unpublished data), typically most aliphatic substitutions are tolerated. Polar and charged residues are poorly tolerated at buried positions. In contrast, mutations to aliphatic residues are often poorly tolerated at active-site residues (which are typically exposed). Polar and charged residues are sometimes tolerated and also the average mutational tolerance for active-site residues is typically lower than that for buried residues. Mutational tolerance is the fraction of active mutants for each mutant amino acid. This sensitivity to aliphatic substitutions at active-site residues is likely the reason that Ala scanning mutagenesis has been so successful at identifying residues at protein:protein and protein:ligand binding sites (Cunningham and Wells, 1989). Based on the above criteria residues Q2, F3, Y6, S22, I24, N95, W99, G100 and I101 can be identified as putative active-site residues based solely on the mutational data. Similar mutational patterns are seen for two other proteins for which extensive mutational data exist, the PDZ domain (PSD95<sup>pdz3</sup>) (McLaughlin et al, 2012) and the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1) (Olson et al., 2014) (unpublished data). In addition to differences in mutational sensitivity patterns, an important difference between active-site and buried-site mutations is that the former typically affect specific activity and not the level of properly folded protein, while the latter primarily affect the level of properly folded protein (Bajaj et al., 2008). Thus measurements of protein levels and possibly sensitivity of mutant activity to chaperone overexpression (Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009) can also be used to distinguish between active-site and buried-site mutants. The average hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment (Varadarajan et al., 1996) can also be used as supplementary parameters to distinguish between exposed, active-site and buried-site residues. The above points are included in the subsection \"Selection of parent inactive mutant\"."

Further, unlike proximal suppressors no complementarity in amino acid property relative to the parent inactive mutant (PIM) is expected for a distal suppressor. We have shown that the mutational sensitivity measure, RankScore correlates with residue depths derived from the crystal structure of the protein (Figure 4B <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> of (Adkar et al., 2012)). Residue depth is defined as the distance of any atom/residue to the closest bulk water (Chakravarty and Varadarajan, 1999; Tan et al., 2011). The value for RankScore ranges between 1 to 100. For a given non active-site residue, a higher value of RankScore indicates that the residue is likely to be buried in the protein structure. The plot for variation of RankScore with residue depth is shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a>. Active-site residues (inferred solely from mutational data) and Gly and Pro residues have been removed.

It is therefore expected that positions at which local suppressors occur will also have high depth, high RankScores and high average mutational sensitivity in the SSM library (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). From <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a>, it is evident that all the positions with low RankScores are exposed on the protein structure. Therefore, all positions with RankScore=1 are very likely to be present on the surface, and hence were classified as distal suppressors. A RankScore of 1 is a conservative cutoff for distal suppressors, probably a cutoff of five or ten would yield similar results. As can be seen from the figure, the RankScore cutoff of 25 which we have chosen for proximal suppressors, clearly identifies only buried residues with depth &gt; 5.5\u00c5. All these residues have accessibility &lt; 1.5%. In the present work we assume that distal suppressors will be global suppressors. Hence, the most reliable way to identify these would be to confirm that the same putative distal suppressor is able to suppress multiple PIMs, preferably PIMs which are not in contact with each other. The latter is likely to be true if neither PIM has a suppressor at the site of the other PIM. Using these criteria we can clearly infer that R10G, E11R, E11K and E11P are likely global suppressors."

While distinguishing between global and local suppressors maybe more challenging in membrane proteins, given sufficient double mutant data, it should be straightforward because global suppressors should suppress a much larger number of parent inactive mutants (PIMs) than local suppressors. We are currently confirming this by constructing larger double mutant libraries for both CcdB and DgkA. With regard to the relative frequency of global and local suppressors, if a single-site saturation mutagenesis library is enriched for inactive mutants (PIMs), subjected to random mutagenesis and screened for suppressors, the resulting population will be enriched for global suppressors (Bershtein et al., 2008; Bershtein et al., 2006). This is because a global suppressor will suppress multiple PIMs. As described in 1.2 above, this can be used to distinguish between local and global suppressors. However, for a specific PIM, it is not obvious that global suppressors will dominate. A recent study examined a library of the 75 amino acid RRM domain of the yeast poly-A binding protein (Melamed et al., 2013). Functional scores for 1246 single and 39,912 double mutants were obtained. Epistatic interactions were enriched for residue pairs with short sequence spacing (&lt;5) and short distance (10-15\u00c5). Another recent study (Olson et al., 2014) reported exhaustive screening of single and double mutants of GB1 (Olson et al, 2014). The majority of pairs displaying positive epistasis had C\u03b2-C\u03b2 distances &lt; 8\u00c5. Both of the above studies indicate that local suppressors may occur at higher frequency than global ones with respect to individual PIMs but more data is required to confirm this.

The field of protein structure prediction went very deep into the use of decoy libraries to test prediction methods in the late 90's and early 2000's. It was later clear that discriminating structures in those conditions was a quite easy exercise and almost any simple method (i.e. surface exposition prediction) was able to perform well in that type of test. In other words, to be convincing these experiments will have to show that the discrimination is substantially better than the one provided by simple prediction methods.To summarize the reviewers\u2019 concerns, if the authors decide to include comparisons to other methods, then the comparisons should be done on fair basis. Two examples may be sufficient to illustrate the point. The prediction methods based on multiple sequence alignments are not specific for any of the proteins in the alignments and therefore it does not make sense to evaluate them in terms of distances between sidechains (that are specific to each structure), as the authors do. Second, and very important, since the publications of those prediction methods it was very clear that they can be applied only to rich alignments with thousands of sequences. The current application to small alignments does not demonstrate anything but a known principal limitation of the methods (\"350 alignments\" as reported in the paper).The authors should decide whether or not to present comparisons to other methods in this paper, and present a judicious discussion of the value of their method.</i>4.1) EVfold for contact prediction for DgkA"

If you disturb a give side-chain-DNA contact, why would a mutation in an adjacent position compensate for that? Unlike the packing-stability that is accounted for (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), the mechanistic basis of compensation of functional residues remains therefore unclear. Perhaps the authors should not use \"function\", i.e. ligand binding, to illustrate the method (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) but rather, core-packing compensation.</i>We chose \u2018function\u2019 to illustrate the method in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> because our readout for core packing compensation is a functional readout, i.e., ligand binding for CcdB and cell survival for DgkA. None of our PIMs is at a functional site for precisely the reason mentioned by the reviewers. In the present work we exclude active-site residues when choosing PIMs. The PIMs are present at the protein core and disturb the packing at the core. The resulting decrease in activity is due to a decrease in the amount of properly folded, functional protein in the cell. In the example given by the reviewers, the PIM is at a functional \u2018active-site\u2019 residue at a protein:ligand interface. In this situation we would look for a suppressor mutation in the binding partner (DNA in this case) and not an intragenic suppressor. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> is an overly simplified schematic.
