In Huntington's disease (HD) action suppression is impaired, resembling the effects of STN lesioning or inactivation. To explore this potential linkage, the STN was studied in BAC transgenic and Q175 knock-in mouse models of HD. At &lt;2 and 6 months of age autonomous STN activity was impaired due to activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. STN neurons exhibited prolonged NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, caused by a deficit in glutamate uptake, and elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress, which was ameliorated by NMDA receptor antagonism. STN activity was rescued by NMDA receptor antagonism or the break down of hydrogen peroxide. At 12 months of age approximately 30% of STN neurons had been lost, as in HD. Together, these data argue that dysfunction within the STN is an early feature of HD that may contribute to its expression and course."

In Huntington's disease (HD) action suppression is impaired, resembling the effects of STN lesioning or inactivation. To explore this potential linkage, the STN was studied in BAC transgenic and Q175 knock-in mouse models of HD. At &lt;2 and 6 months of age autonomous STN activity was impaired due to activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. STN neurons exhibited prolonged NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, caused by a deficit in glutamate uptake, and elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress, which was ameliorated by NMDA receptor antagonism. STN activity was rescued by NMDA receptor antagonism or the break down of hydrogen peroxide. At 12 months of age approximately 30% of STN neurons had been lost, as in HD. Together, these data argue that dysfunction within the STN is an early feature of HD that may contribute to its expression and course."

Information flow from the cortex to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia occurs via three major pathways. The so-called direct pathway through the striatum promotes movement and \u2018rewarding\u2019 behavior through inhibition of GABAergic basal ganglia output (<a href=\"#bib25\">Chevalier and Deniau, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Kravitz and Kreitzer, 2012</a>). In contrast, the indirect pathway via the striatum, external globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the hyperdirect pathway through the STN suppress the same processes through elevation of basal ganglia output (<a href=\"#bib61\">Maurice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tachibana et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Kravitz and Kreitzer, 2012</a>). Indeed, interruption of the indirect and hyperdirect pathways through lesion or inactivation of the STN is associated with elevated/involuntary movement, impulsivity and psychiatric disturbances such as hypomania and hyper-sexuality (<a href=\"#bib27\">Crossman et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hamada and DeLong, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Baunez and Robbins, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bickel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</a>)."

These symptoms have traditionally been linked to cortico-striatal degeneration, however a role for the STN is suggested by their similarity to those caused by STN inactivation or lesion. The hypoactivity of the STN in HD models in vivo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Callahan and Abercrombie, 2015a</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2015b</a>) and the susceptibility of the STN to degeneration in HD (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lange et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Guo et al., 2012</a>) are also consistent with STN dysfunction."

Several reports suggest that glutamate uptake is impaired due to reduced expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT2 (GLT-1) and/or GLT-1 dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib6\">Arzberger et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Li\u00e9vens et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Behrens et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Miller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Bradford et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Faideau et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Huang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Menalled et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Dvorzhak et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Jiang et al., 2016</a>). However, others have found no evidence for deficient glutamate uptake (<a href=\"#bib74\">Parsons et al., 2016</a>), suggesting that abnormal NMDAR-mediated transmission is caused by increased expression of extrasynaptic receptors and/or aberrant coupling to signaling pathways (e.g., <a href=\"#bib73\">Parsons and Raymond, 2014</a>). The sensitivity of mitochondria to anomalous NMDAR signaling is likely to be further compounded by their intrinsically compromised status in HD (<a href=\"#bib82\">Song et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Johri et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Martin et al., 2015</a>)."

Despite the\u00a0loss and hypoactivity of STN neurons in HD and the similarity of HD symptoms to those arising from STN lesion or inactivation, the role of the STN in HD remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the abnormal activity and progressive loss of STN neurons in HD may reflect abnormalities within the STN itself. This hypothesis was addressed in the BAC and Q175 KI HD models using a combination of cellular and synaptic electrophysiology, optogenetic interrogation, two-photon imaging and stereological cell counting."

To determine whether this property is compromised in HD mice, the autonomous activity of STN neurons in ex vivo brain slices prepared from BACHD and wild type littermate (WT) mice were compared using non-invasive, loose-seal, cell-attached patch clamp recordings. 5\u20137 months old, symptomatic and 1\u20132 months old, presymptomatic mice were studied (<a href=\"#bib34\">Gray et al., 2008</a>). Recordings focused on the lateral two-thirds of the STN, which receives input from the motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kita and Kita, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Chu et al., 2015</a>). At 5\u20137 months, 124/128 (97%) WT neurons exhibited autonomous activity compared to 110/126 (87%) BACHD neurons (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0049; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The frequency (WT: 7.9 [5.2\u201312.6] Hz; n\u00a0= 128; BACHD: 6.3 [1.4\u201310.2] Hz; n\u00a0= 126; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and regularity (WT CV: 0.27 [0.14\u20130.47]; n\u00a0= 124; BACHD CV: 0.36 [0.20\u20130.80]; n\u00a0= 110; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0012) of firing were reduced in BACHD neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The distribution of firing frequency of WT neurons appears unimodal with a mode at\u00a0~6\u20138 Hz (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), whereas the distribution of BACHD neurons is relatively bimodal with modes at\u00a0~0\u20132 Hz and\u00a0~8\u201310 Hz (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This distribution suggests that BACHD neurons consist of a phenotypic population with compromised autonomous firing, and a non-phenotypic population with relatively normal autonomous firing. At 1\u20132 months 136/145 (94%) WT STN neurons were autonomously active versus 120/143 (84%) BACHD STN neurons (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0086). The frequency (WT: 9.8 [6.3\u201314.8] Hz; n\u00a0= 145; BACHD: 7.1 [1.8\u201311.3] Hz; n\u00a0= 143; p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001) and regularity (WT CV: 0.17 [0.13\u20130.26]; n\u00a0= 136; BACHD CV: 0.23 [0.14\u20130.76]; n\u00a0= 120; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0016) of firing were also reduced in BACHD neurons. Together, these data demonstrate that the autonomous activity of STN neurons in BACHD mice is impaired at both early presymptomatic and later symptomatic ages."

In control conditions, the amplitudes of EPSCs recorded from WT and BACHD neurons were similar (WT: 50.1 [34.7\u201361.0] pA; n\u00a0= 12; BACHD: 45.6 [22.1\u201378.3] pA; n\u00a0= 11; p<sub>h</sub>\u00a0= 0.7399; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and there was no correlation between EPSC amplitude and the decay time constant in either group (WT: r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0= 0.16; n\u00a0= 12; p<sub>h</sub>\u00a0= 0.5871; BACHD: r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0= 0.10; n\u00a0= 12; p<sub>h</sub>\u00a0= 0.6686; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In order to increase spillover of glutamate from synaptic release sites, cortico-STN inputs were optogenetically stimulated 5 times at 50 Hz and the resulting compound NMDAR-mediated EPSC was compared in WT and BACHD STN neurons. Interestingly, the decay of compound NMDAR EPSCs under control conditions or following inhibition of glutamate uptake were not different in WT and BACHD mice (WT control: 79.0 [62.6\u2013102.0] ms; n\u00a0= 6; BACHD control: 65.2 [44.7\u2013111.5] ms; n\u00a0= 6; p = 0.4848; WT TFB-TBOA: 125.4 [106.8\u2013146.6] ms; n\u00a0= 6; BACHD TFB-TBOA: 108.3 [94.5\u2013143.1] ms; n\u00a0= 6; p = 0.6991; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). Together, these data demonstrate that individual, but not compound, NMDAR-mediated cortico-STN synaptic EPSCs are prolonged in the BACHD model."

To test whether STN neurons from BACHD mice exhibit increased mitochondrial oxidant stress, a mitochondria-targeted redox probe MTS-roGFP (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hanson et al., 2004</a>) was virally expressed in 5\u20137-month-old BACHD mice and WT littermates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). 1\u20132 weeks later MTS-roGFP was imaged in brain slices under two-photon excitation with 890 nm light. Oxidant stress was estimated from the fluorescence of MTS-roGFP in individual neurons under baseline conditions relative to the fluorescence of MTS-roGFP under conditions of full reduction and oxidation in the presence of 2 mM dithiothreitol and 200 \u00b5M aldrithiol-4, respectively (<a href=\"#bib77\">Sanchez-Padilla et al., 2014</a>). STN neurons were selected for analysis based on their appearance under two-photon, Dodt contrast imaging and were distinguishable from STN glial cells by their relatively large diameter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). STN neurons are reliably recorded when this selection strategy is employed to guide patch clamp recording (<a href=\"#bib8\">Atherton et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2010</a>). MTS-roGFP imaging revealed that relative oxidant stress in BACHD STN neurons was elevated compared to WT (WT: 0.35 [0.18\u20130.42]; n\u00a0= 23; BACHD: 0.40 [0.37\u20130.63]; n\u00a0= 24; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0332; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In a separate experiment (performed 15 months later) to test whether NMDAR activation ex vivo contributed to elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress, brain slices from a different cohort of BACHD mice were treated for\u00a0&gt;3 hr in 50 \u00b5M D-AP5 prior to imaging. MTS-roGFP imaging confirmed that D-AP5-treated slices exhibited lower oxidant stress compared to untreated slices from the same mice (untreated: 0.39 [0.35\u20130.48]; n\u00a0= 13; D-AP5-treated: 0.32 [0.24\u20130.42]; n = 17; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0445; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

Because mitochondrial oxidant stress and reactive oxygen species can trigger apoptotic pathways leading to cell death (<a href=\"#bib35\">Green and Reed, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2008</a>), the number of STN neurons in 12-month-old BACHD and WT mice were compared (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>).

In the STN, inhibition of GLT-1 (and GLAST) slowed individual NMDAR EPSCs in WT but not BACHD mice and eliminated the differences in their decay kinetics, arguing that impaired uptake of glutamate by astrocytes contributed to the relative prolongation of NMDAR-mediated EPSCs in BACHD STN neurons. Interestingly, and in contrast to the striatum (<a href=\"#bib65\">Milnerwood et al., 2010</a>), when spillover of glutamate onto extrasynaptic receptors was increased by train stimulation and inhibition of astrocytic glutamate uptake, the resulting compound NMDAR EPSC and its prolongation by uptake inhibition were similar in BACHD and WT mice, arguing against an increase in extrasynaptic STN NMDAR expression/function in BACHD mice. Slowing of astrocytic glutamate uptake has recently been shown to occur during increased presynaptic activity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Armbruster et al., 2016</a>). Thus, train stimulation may have slowed glutamate uptake sufficiently\u00a0to\u00a0occlude/eliminate the differences in uptake that were observed in BACHD and WT STN neurons during single stimulation. Whether the modest differences in glutamate uptake that were observed here are sufficient to promote NMDAR-mediated dysfunction in HD STN neurons remains to be determined."

If the relatively low level of glutamatergic transmission present ex vivo is sufficient to impair firing then this impairment is likely to be more severe in vivo where STN neurons are powerfully patterned by glutamatergic transmission arising from the cortex, thalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus and superior colliculus (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib15\">Bevan, 2017</a>). Non-synaptic sources of extracellular glutamate, such as diffusion/release from astrocytes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Cavelier and Attwell, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Lee et al., 2013</a>) may also contribute to excessive NMDAR activation in HD mice."

Although we saw no evidence of basal mitochondrial dysfunction that was not attributable to increased NMDAR function, there is considerable evidence that mutant huntingtin causes transcriptional dysregulation, which leads to defective mitochondrial quality control, an increase in the proportion of defective, ROS generating mitochondria and an increase in opening of the permeability transition pore (<a href=\"#bib63\">Milakovic and Johnson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Panov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Fernandes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Song et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Chaturvedi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Johri et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Martin et al., 2015</a>).

The absence of neuronal loss in the cortex and striatum in the same models at an equivalent time point suggests that STN dysfunction and degeneration may be particularly influential in the early disease process. Although the STN is known to degenerate in HD, it is not clear why neuronal loss is ultimately less than that observed in the striatum at the end stage of the disease, despite the fact that dysfunction and degeneration occur earlier (at least in HD models). Future research will be required to determine whether subtypes of STN neurons exhibit selective vulnerability and/or whether the processes promoting their degeneration, e.g. cortical activation of STN NMDARs, ultimately wane."

In the \u2018classical\u2019 model of basal ganglia function, degeneration of indirect pathway striatal projection neurons is proposed to underlie the symptoms of early stage HD (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albin et al., 1989</a>). Here we show for the first time that STN dysfunction and neuronal loss precede cortico-striatal abnormalities in HD models. Thus, dysfunction and degeneration of cortical and striatal neurons occurs in concert with profound changes in other elements of the basal ganglia. Therapeutic strategies that target the STN may therefore be useful not only for treating the psychomotor symptoms of early- to mid-stage HD but also for influencing dysfunction and degeneration throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit."

The firing rate of STN neurons was calculated from 1 min of recording or 100 action potentials (whichever covered the longer time period). Imaging data were analyzed using FIJI (<a href=\"#bib79\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285\">SCR_002285</a>). Statistical analyses were performed in Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798\">SCR_002798</a>) or R (<a href=\"http://www.r-project.org/\">http://www.r-project.org/</a>; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905\">SCR_001905</a>, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000432\">SCR_000432</a>). In order to make no assumptions about the distribution of the data, non-parametric statistical tests were used, and data are reported as <i>median [interquartile range]</i>; outliers were not excluded from the analysis. An \u03b1-level of 0.05 was used for two-way statistical comparisons performed with the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired data (represented with box plots), the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data (tilted line segment plots), Fisher's exact test for categorical data (bar plots) or the F-test for linear regression. Where datasets were used in multiple comparisons the p-value was adjusted to maintain the family-wise error rate at 0.05 using the Holm-Bonferroni method (<a href=\"#bib41\">Holm, 1979</a>); adjusted p-values are denoted p<sub>h</sub>. Box plots show median (central line), interquartile range (box) and 10\u201390% range (whiskers). For the primary findings reported in the manuscript, sample sizes for Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were estimated to achieve a minimum of 80% power using formulae described by <a href=\"#bib69\">Noether (1987)</a>. The effect sizes used in these power calculations were estimated using data randomly drawn from uniform distributions (runif() function in R stats package). For Mann-Whitney tests, with a 50 percentile change in median between groups X and Y (the interquartile ranges of the groups don\u2019t overlap) P(Y &gt; X) \u2248 0.88 giving an estimation that at least 10 observations per group would be needed to achieve 80% power; for a 25 percentile change (the median of Y falls outside the interquartile range of X) P(Y &gt; X) \u2248 0.72 and the estimated requirement is at least 27 observations per group. For Wilcoxon tests, if all pairs of observations show the same direction of change, P(X + X\u2019\u00a0&gt; 0)= 1 giving an estimation that at least 10 observations would be needed to achieve 80% power (note though that it is possible to show empirically that 6 observations gives 100% power in this case); if 90% of observations show the same direction of change, P(X + X\u2019\u00a0&gt; 0) \u2248 0.98 and the estimated requirement is at least 12 pairs of observations."

Involvement of the STN in HD has been debated over the years and this work, at least in mouse models of HD, provides the strongest evidence to data that the STN is a central aspect of HD pathology. A strength is that their observation/results were obtained using two full length Htt mouse models of HD. Starting at early stages of disease in these models they found that STN neurons had decreased intrinsic firing rate and related this to activation of KATP channels. This is followed by an elevated extra-synaptic NMDA activation by increased glutamate levels (results of decreased astrocyte uptake). Lastly, they show that at later stages, 12 months, there is a significant loss of STN neurons. Overall the data are strong making a convincible demonstration that the STN is involved in these models of HD. This is important as therapies for HD move to the clinic. This work provides a strong basis for the importance of assessing STN efficacy of treatments"

(2016), showing that train stimulation itself slows glutamate uptake, which might occlude a small difference in the NMDAR EPSC decay time constant, as the authors have postulated for the TFB-TBOA.

Moreover, the difference between the mean decay time constant in wild-type vs. BAC HD STN neurons is barely significant (P=0.0455). To further test the idea that impaired glutamate uptake is responsible for slowed decay for single NMDAR EPSCs, the authors could try using the glutamate scavenger GPT to see if this can accelerate decay time and show a greater effect in HD than wild-type, and/or add dextran to the extracellular solution to slow diffusion \u2013 this should magnify any differences in transporter function between the genotypes (see Mahfooz et al.

Moreover, they don't explore any in vivo recording to confirm altered STN firing or responsiveness to cortical and/or striatal iSPN input. As well, the link between these molecular alterations, aberrant autonomous firing, and STN neuronal loss is not established. The latter is complicated by the fact that the STN is part of the indirect pathway, which is impaired early at the level of striatal iSPNs (early loss of enkephalin and DARPP32, enhanced excitability, loss of LTP, increased extra-synaptic NMDAR signaling, etc.).</i> "

Now that we have confirmed that STN neurons are indeed dysfunctional in two HD models, we can next pursue whether STN dysfunction contributes to abnormal behavior in these HD models. We are currently evaluating several approaches based on the novel findings presented here that might ameliorate STN dysfunction in HD mice in vivo. However, these experiments will likely generate another full manuscript and are therefore beyond the scope of the current report. We concur that we have not yet established whether the STN dysfunction and neurodegeneration that we have described for the first time contribute to abnormal behavior in these models and have tempered the manuscript accordingly. We also agree that we have not yet established that the neuronal loss that we observed is directly related to the increased NMDAR-dependent, oxidative stress of STN neurons, although this is a well-recognized cell death pathway. We are therefore currently testing whether correcting or compensating for STN dysfunction, using strategies suggested by the abnormalities reported here, will reduce or eliminate cell death."

However, this could make sense in the context of a recent study by Armbruster et al. (2016), showing that train stimulation itself slows glutamate uptake, which might occlude a small difference in the NMDAR EPSC decay time constant, as the authors have postulated for the TFB-TBOA. The phenomenon reported by Armbruster et al. seems a more likely explanation for the difference in results, rather than what the authors suggest, that impaired glutamate uptake is restricted to the synapse. The latter seems unlikely since astrocytes ensheath more than one synapse.</i> "

Moreover, the difference between the mean decay time constant in wild-type vs. BAC HD STN neurons is barely significant (P=0.0455). To further test the idea that impaired glutamate uptake is responsible for slowed decay for single NMDAR EPSCs, the authors could try using the glutamate scavenger GPT to see if this can accelerate decay time and show a greater effect in HD than wild-type, and/or add dextran to the extracellular solution to slow diffusion \u2013 this should magnify any differences in transporter function between the genotypes (see Mahfooz et al.

In fact, few studies have measured clearance of synaptically released glutamate in brain slice: of these, one study in striatum demonstrated no impairment of glutamate uptake/clearance in R6/2 or YAC28 mice (Parsons et al., 2016), while two others show either minimal impairment with prolonged (200 ms), high concentration (3 mM) glutamate pulses (Dvorzhak et al., 2016) or slowing only of the late component of the iGluSnFr response (&gt; 2 sec after synaptic release; Jiang et al., 2016).</i> "
