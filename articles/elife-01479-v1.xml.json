Central to flagellar growth is the organization of microtubules that polymerize from basal bodies to form the axoneme, which consists of hundreds of proteins. Flagella exist in all eukaryotic phyla, but neither the mechanism by which flagella grow nor the conservation of this process in evolution are known. Here, we study how protein complexes assemble onto the growing axoneme tip using (cryo) electron tomography. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> microtubules and associated proteins are added simultaneously. However, in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, disorganized arrays of microtubules are arranged into the axoneme structure by the later addition of preformed protein complexes. Post assembly, the <i>T. brucei</i> transition zone alters structure and its association with the central pair loosens. We conclude that there are multiple ways to form a flagellum and that species-specific structural knowledge is critical before evaluating flagellar defects."

Central to flagellar growth is the organization of microtubules that polymerize from basal bodies to form the axoneme, which consists of hundreds of proteins. Flagella exist in all eukaryotic phyla, but neither the mechanism by which flagella grow nor the conservation of this process in evolution are known. Here, we study how protein complexes assemble onto the growing axoneme tip using (cryo) electron tomography. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> microtubules and associated proteins are added simultaneously. However, in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, disorganized arrays of microtubules are arranged into the axoneme structure by the later addition of preformed protein complexes. Post assembly, the <i>T. brucei</i> transition zone alters structure and its association with the central pair loosens. We conclude that there are multiple ways to form a flagellum and that species-specific structural knowledge is critical before evaluating flagellar defects."

Some species of eukaryote\u2014such as <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, a single-celled green alga, and <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, the protist parasite that causes African sleeping sickness\u2014must grow new flagella when their cells divide, so that each new cell can swim. Using a form of electron microscopy called electron tomography, H\u00f6\u00f6g et al. could see the detailed structure of the growing flagella in three dimensions. At first the cores of the flagella in these two distantly related species grow in the same way. However as the flagella get longer their cores grow in completely different ways. The microtubule filaments in longer flagella grow in a synchronized manner in the alga, but in a disorganized way in the protist."

It is a thin, microtubule-containing, membrane-covered extension on the surface of the cell, which may generate cell motility and/or act as a sensory and signaling organelle. Defects in cilia and flagella can cause severe human diseases for example skeletal deformations, polycystic kidney disease, infertility, situs invertus, blindness, obesity, and even cancer (<a href=\"#bib16\">Escudier et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chandok, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Huber and Cormier-Daire, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 2012</a>).

Axonemes originate inside the cell at basal bodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). From the basal body, nine doublet microtubules (dMTs) extend into the next section along the flagellum called the transition zone. The transition zone ends at the basal plate, an electron-dense structure found in the region, where the two central pair microtubules (CPs) are nucleated and the canonical 9+2 axoneme arrangement starts. The dMTs consist of a complete A-tubule containing 13 protofilaments and an incomplete B-tubule containing 10 protofilaments (<a href=\"#bib62\">Warner and Satir, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amos and Klug, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sui and Downing, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nicastro et al., 2011</a>). Dynein arms are bound to the A-tubule of the dMTs and walk on the neighboring B-tubule. This causes dMTs to slide along each other, introducing sheer, which is converted into flagellar bending by several classes of static links. Flagellar bending is controlled so as to induce motility in some cells (e.g., spermatozoa, <i>Giardia spp.</i> and <i>Trypanosoma spp.</i>) and propel the surrounding media in other cells (e.g., respiratory tract epithelia, fallopian tube epithelium). In addition to the MT components of the axoneme, partially assembled protein modules such as radial spokes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Qin, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Diener et al., 2011</a>), nexin links and central pair projections are important for axonemal function through their roles as cross-linkers and regulators of dMT sliding and bending."

Flagellar elongation occurs by addition of protein subunits at the axoneme\u2019s distal end (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rosenbaum and Child, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Marshall, 2001</a>). Large protein complexes containing the precursor axoneme building blocks are delivered to this site via an evolutionary conserved process called intraflagellar transport (IFT; [<a href=\"#bib34\">Kozminski et al., 1993</a>]). The roles of IFT in ciliary function are well studied (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008</a>), and the molecular mechanisms that mediate IFT of axonemal proteins are beginning to be characterized (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</a>). The structure of the flagellar tip has been characterized; the B-tubule ends before the A-tubule creating a distal \u2018singlet region\u2019 in the flagellum tip of most species (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ringo, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Satir, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sale and Satir, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Woolley and Nickels, 1985</a>); the CPs extend further into the distal tip than the dMTs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ringo, 1967</a>); the dMTs and CPs are linked to the membrane through capping structures (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dentler, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Woolley et al., 2006</a>). Yet, we know very little about how the flagellar components, once delivered to the distal tip, are assembled to form the beating flagellum (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fisch and Dupuis-Williams, 2012</a>). For example, does the CP extend beyond the dMTs during tip growth, like in the mature flagellum, or is the growth of all MTs synchronized? Alternatively do the dMTs extend beyond the CP during flagellar extension? When do other structural modules such as radial spokes, dynein arms, and central pair projections get incorporated? Clearly, there are multiple possibilities for how a flagellum might extend."

After mitosis, the small daughter cells remain within the wall of the mother cell where they regrow their flagella; a cell stage we easily identified in the electron microscope. In <i>T. brucei</i> the new flagellum starts growing midway through the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sherwin and Gull, 1989</a>). Its tip is attached to the side of the old flagellum by a structure called the flagella connector (<a href=\"#bib41\">Moreira-Leite, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Briggs, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Davidge, 2006</a>). The relative positions of a cell\u2019s two flagella allow an unambiguous identification of which flagellum is old and which is new (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>).

Second, in new flagella, the \u223c30-nm thick basal plate consisted of two stacked electron-dense rings, and the minus ends were found within the more distal ring (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In old flagella, this defined basal plate structure consisting of two rings was gradually lost and replaced with a more diffuse electron dense mass that became up to 90 nm thick with the progression of the flagellum maturation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,G,H</a>). Third, the central pair minus ends were commonly found within this electron dense mass in old flagella, but in 2 out of the 10 CPs, one of the ends was found around 100 nm distal to the basal plate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,G</a>; cells 3 and 5), showing a loosened CP anchoring in more mature flagella."

The nine central cylinder structures were all between 120 and 200 nm (average 158 \u00b1 25 nm), but there was no detectable increase in their thickness with flagella length.

In contrast, our study suggests that the axonemal dMTs and structural proteins are assembling simultaneously in long <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. What regulates such differences in the assembly pathways? <a href=\"#bib12\">Dentler (1980)</a> showed that the growing axoneme in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> had structures linking from the tips of the microtubules to the membrane. <a href=\"#bib63\">Woolley et al.

However, the initial growth rate of regrowing <i>C. reinhardtii</i> flagella (shed by ionic shock) is approximately 12\u201324 \u00b5m/hr, which then declines to 9 \u00b5m/hr as the flagellum gets longer (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rosenbaum et al., 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Flavin and Slaughter, 1974</a>). The growth rate of their flagella after mitosis remains unknown, but we assume equal or faster assembly because of the pre-mitotic reabsorbtion of the flagellar components that could then be utilized in the construction of the next flagellum.

Ciliogenesis will most likely involve a whole subset of flagellar proteins, with functions that are distinct from the IFT of axonemal proteins to the assembling tip. Flagellar growth rates after ionic shock in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> are length dependent, with shorter flagella growing faster than longer ones. Together with a steady disassembly rate, this forms the basis of the balance-point-model of flagellar length regulation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Marshall et al., 2005</a>). The faster growth of short <i>C. reinhardtii</i> was then showed to depend on longer IFT trans in the short flagellum (<a href=\"#bib15\">Engel et al., 2009</a>). This would fit well with our observations that the modes of assembly in the short and long post-mitotic <i>C. reinhardtii</i> tips do not differ beyond the point of central pair extension. Interestingly, we did detect differences in short vs long growing flagellar tips in <i>T. brucei</i>, an organism that most likely has linear flagellum growth. The absence of several axonemal components at the long growing tip might indicate that IFT is rate limiting in this growth. One would then predict that flagellar length is independent of size of IFT trains in these cells. However, it has recently been shown that the IFT traffic in <i>T. brucei</i> also differs considerably from that of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buisson et al., 2013</a>)."

After the cultures were shifted to the dark cycle, the cells were prepared for electron microscopy by HPF followed by freeze substitution as essentially described in <a href=\"#bib44\">O\u2019Toole et al. (2003, 2007)</a>. Briefly, the liquid culture was spun at 500\u00d7<i>g</i> for 5 min and the loose pellet was resuspended in a medium containing 150 mM mannitol for 1 hr. The samples were then spun at 500\u00d7<i>g</i>, the supernatant decanted and the loose pellet frozen using a BAL-TEC HPM-010 high-pressure freezer. The frozen samples were freeze substituted in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> and 0.1% uranyl acetate in acetone for 3 days then embedded in epon/araldite resin."
