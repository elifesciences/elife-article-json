Clinically active investigational FLT3 inhibitors can achieve complete remissions but their utility has been hampered by acquired resistance and myelosuppression attributed to a \u2018synthetic lethal toxicity\u2019 arising from simultaneous inhibition of FLT3 and KIT. We report a novel chemical strategy for selective FLT3 inhibition while avoiding KIT inhibition with the staurosporine analog, Star 27. Star 27 maintains potency against FLT3 in proliferation assays of FLT3-transformed cells compared with KIT-transformed cells, shows no toxicity towards normal human hematopoiesis at concentrations that inhibit primary FLT3-mutant AML blast growth, and is active against mutations that confer resistance to clinical inhibitors. As a more complete understanding of kinase networks emerges, it may be possible to define anti-targets such as KIT in the case of AML to allow improved kinase inhibitor design of clinical agents with enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity."

Clinically active investigational FLT3 inhibitors can achieve complete remissions but their utility has been hampered by acquired resistance and myelosuppression attributed to a \u2018synthetic lethal toxicity\u2019 arising from simultaneous inhibition of FLT3 and KIT. We report a novel chemical strategy for selective FLT3 inhibition while avoiding KIT inhibition with the staurosporine analog, Star 27. Star 27 maintains potency against FLT3 in proliferation assays of FLT3-transformed cells compared with KIT-transformed cells, shows no toxicity towards normal human hematopoiesis at concentrations that inhibit primary FLT3-mutant AML blast growth, and is active against mutations that confer resistance to clinical inhibitors. As a more complete understanding of kinase networks emerges, it may be possible to define anti-targets such as KIT in the case of AML to allow improved kinase inhibitor design of clinical agents with enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity."

Since these agents almost exclusively target a kinase's highly conserved ATP binding pocket, achieving selectivity is problematic. A limiting feature of kinase inhibitors is that their ability to target multiple wild-type kinases in normal tissues limits the doses that can be used to target the mutant kinase in the tumor tissue. The key question, in light of the complex kinase networks in all cells, is which anti-targets should be avoided, in order to limit toxicity in normal tissues. Our work (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kung et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dar et al., 2012</a>) and that of others (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmad and Eisen, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wilhelm et al., 2006</a>) have highlighted the potent effects of multi-targeted kinase inhibitors, revealing unexpected effects when several kinases are inhibited rather than each one individually (synthetic lethal effects as well as positive epistatic effects). By understanding the synthetic lethal effects on normal cells and developing selective inhibitors which avoid even a small number of \u2018off-target\u2019 kinases, we believe that clinical agents with an improved therapeutic index can be developed."

Mutations at the activation loop residue D835 are particularly clinically problematic. These mutations are proposed to bias the kinase toward the constitutively <i>active</i> conformation by disrupting a hydrogen bond from D835 to S838, and thus limit the efficacy of Type II inhibitors such as AC220.

For example, when C7 (R<sub>1</sub>) equals isobutyl (Star 12), AS Src kinase is potently inhibited but WT kinases remain unaffected. However, we also observed that Star 12, in a panel of 319 kinases, weakly inhibits only one WT kinase, FLT3 (57% inhibition at 1 \u00b5M; KIT, CSF1R, PDGFR\u03b1/\u03b2 all inhibited &lt;10%). Thus, the C7-alkyl group of Star 12 may allow for weak but selective inhibition of FLT3 over the anti-target KIT, which contributes to myelosuppression when FLT3 is also inhibited. Although substitution of an isobutyl group at C7 reduced potency, we hypothesized that combining the FLT3/KIT selectivity of Star 12 and the potency features of PKC412 would generate an optimal FLT3 inhibitor also capable of targeting emerging mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

(a) Electronics: we calculate that PKC412 maintains a partial positive charge at its lactam C7 position, matching the partial negative charge of KIT's Thr GK (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>), while Star 27's C7 methyl renders its lactam relatively neutral (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>), reducing this affinity interaction. (b) Sterics: staralogs with no C7 substitution maintain a flat lactam for binding to the hinge region, adjacent to the GK. Based on crystallographic data from KIT's active conformation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gajiwala et al., 2009</a>), a simple steric argument may explain why Star 27's C7 methyl group prevents binding to KIT's restricted ATP binding pocket while PKC412 potently binds (data not shown). Conversely, FLT3's active site is hypothetically large enough to accommodate the 17.4 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> van der Waal's volume of methyl (vs. 1.17 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> for H). Taken together both arguments may explain the greater affinity of PKC412 for both kinases and of Star 27 for FLT3 but not KIT (calculated using MOE ver2013.0801). This model may account for the selectivity seen for Star 27 for kinases bearing Phe GKs (FLT3, TRK, etc) and away from those bearing Thr GKs (KIT, CSF1R, Src family, other Tyr kinases, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Consequently, FLT3 has been proposed to be a drug target for autoimmunity and inflammation, particularly atherosclerosis.

The challenge is that inhibitors of the oncogene also exhibit off-target effects on closely related kinases that inevitably lead to dose limiting toxicities. The goal of advancing improved molecular-targeted therapies is to identify the key anti-targets that drive toxicity and develop agents that avoid these effects. Our work highlights the synthetic lethal toxicity of an anti-target (KIT) when the oncogenic kinase (FLT3) is inhibited. As more complete understanding of kinase networks emerge it may be possible to delineate the anti-targets to avoid in numerous disease settings to allow improved kinase inhibitor design that can lead to greater ability to inhibit the disease causing pathway activation while avoiding systemic toxicities."

Zebrafish have been shown to be an excellent in vivo model of hematopoiesis (see Davidson et al, 2004; de Jong et al, 2005; <a href=\"#bib20\">He et al, 2014</a>). We tested Star 27 head-to-head with PKC412 in WT animals, and assessed toxicity at both 3 days post fertilization (dpf, gross qualitative effect on heart and tail morphology; new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A-I</a>), and 30 hours post fertilization (hpf, staining as a quantitation of KIT-associated myelopoiesis; new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4J-M</a>). These studies showed clear myelosuppression in PKC412 treated animals with no toxicity in Star 27 treatment groups compared to vehicle treated animals. To assess therapeutic efficacy we treated embryos injected with FLT3-ITD with both drugs. Both drugs greatly converted both \u201cintermediate\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d binned neutrophilic blast groups to \u201cnormal\u201d embryos at 30 hpf, consistent with their equipotency in our other models of AML (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4N-Q</a>).

We have not been able to secure another donor in time for resubmission. Therefore we will not be able to include this requested experiment."
