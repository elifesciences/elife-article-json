Most transposons become hypomethylated, raising the question of their regulation in the absence of DNA methylation. To reproduce a rapid and extensive demethylation, we subjected mouse ES cells to chemically defined hypomethylating culture conditions. Surprisingly, we observed two phases of transposon regulation. After an initial burst of de-repression, various transposon families were efficiently re-silenced. This was accompanied by a reconfiguration of the repressive chromatin landscape: while H3K9me3 was stable, H3K9me2 globally disappeared and H3K27me3 accumulated at transposons. Interestingly, we observed that H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 occupy different transposon families or different territories within the same family, defining three functional categories of adaptive chromatin responses to DNA methylation loss. Our work highlights that H3K9me3 and, most importantly, polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 chromatin pathways can secure the control of a large spectrum of transposons in periods of intense DNA methylation change, ensuring longstanding genome stability."

For ERVs, solo-LTRs were excluded and numbers represent only elements containing internal sequences. (B) Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for genes specifically up-regulated between D0 and D6. Gene ontology analysis for biological processes and molecular functions was performed for the 156 genes that were significantly up-regulated between D0 and D6 but with no significant differences between D0 and D13. The ten most significant terms are shown. (C) List of chimeric transcripts identified during conversion from serum to 2i+vitC. The 30 genes with the highest number of chimeric reads at D6 are ranked here. Numbers represent the absolute read count at the junction between the transposon (first exon) and the second exon of the gene, and the normalized read count of the whole transcript in RPKM.

Most transposons become hypomethylated, raising the question of their regulation in the absence of DNA methylation. To reproduce a rapid and extensive demethylation, we subjected mouse ES cells to chemically defined hypomethylating culture conditions. Surprisingly, we observed two phases of transposon regulation. After an initial burst of de-repression, various transposon families were efficiently re-silenced. This was accompanied by a reconfiguration of the repressive chromatin landscape: while H3K9me3 was stable, H3K9me2 globally disappeared and H3K27me3 accumulated at transposons. Interestingly, we observed that H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 occupy different transposon families or different territories within the same family, defining three functional categories of adaptive chromatin responses to DNA methylation loss. Our work highlights that H3K9me3 and, most importantly, polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 chromatin pathways can secure the control of a large spectrum of transposons in periods of intense DNA methylation change, ensuring longstanding genome stability."

Percentages represent the proportion of active copies relative to the total number of elements in a given family, as estimated from the reconstructed version of RepeatMasker. For ERVs, solo-LTRs were excluded and numbers represent only elements containing internal sequences. (B) Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for genes specifically up-regulated between D0 and D6. Gene ontology analysis for biological processes and molecular functions was performed for the 156 genes that were significantly up-regulated between D0 and D6 but with no significant differences between D0 and D13. The ten most significant terms are shown. (C) List of chimeric transcripts identified during conversion from serum to 2i+vitC. The 30 genes with the highest number of chimeric reads at D6 are ranked here. Numbers represent the absolute read count at the junction between the transposon (first exon) and the second exon of the gene, and the normalized read count of the whole transcript in RPKM.

Finally, in mammals, DNA methylation is naturally erased both during the formation of sperm and egg cells and in the early embryo.

Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) sequences characterize endogenous retroviruses (ERVs, 12% of the mouse genome), which can be further subdivided into three families (ERV1, ERVK and ERVL), according to the infectious retroviruses they derive from (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stocking and Kozak, 2008</a>).

Notably, restraining mechanisms can differ between cell types. In somatic cells and in the male differentiating germline, DNA methylation is the main transcriptional suppressor of LTR and non-LTR transposons. In these contexts, transposable elements are densely methylated (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rollins et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Smith et al., 2012</a>) and DNA hypomethylation leads to their de-repression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bourc\u2019his and Bestor, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Walsh et al., 1998</a>). In contrast, the early germline and the early embryo manage to globally control their transposon burden without DNA methylation. These cells naturally undergo genome-wide loss of DNA methylation, likely as part of the acquisition of a pluripotent, flexible state (<a href=\"#bib60\">Seisenberger et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, genetic studies have demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can use DNA methylation-independent mechanisms to silence transposons: knocking-out the three active DNA methyltransferases (<i>Dnmt</i>-tKO) does not yield significant de-repression of transposons, except Intracisternal A Particle (IAP) elements (<a href=\"#bib28\">Karimi et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Matsui et al., 2010</a>)"

H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), which is deposited by the EHMT2/G9a and EHMT1/GLP lysine methyltransferases, directly and specifically represses class L ERVs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Maksakova et al., 2013</a>). H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) can be catalyzed by the SETDB1 (also known as ESET) or the SUV39H enzymes. The SUV39H system targets H3K9me3 at evolutionary young LTR and non-LTR transposons, but <i>Suv39h</i> mutant ES cells principally up-regulate LINE1 elements\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</a>). In parallel, SETDB1, together with its associated co-repressor, the Kr\u00fcppel-associated box domain (KRAB)-Associated Protein 1 (TRIM28, also known as KAP1), mainly control H3K9me3-dependent suppression of ERVK transposons- a family to which IAP elements belong (<a href=\"#bib28\">Karimi et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Matsui et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rowe et al., 2010</a>).

Therefore, different H3K9 methylation-based mechanisms are utilized to silence different transposons families in ES cells. In contrast, the repressive spectrum of polycomb-mediated H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is limited: only Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV) elements are reactivated upon H3K27me3 deficiency (<a href=\"#bib35\">Leeb et al., 2010</a>)."

ES cells grown in presence of two small kinase inhibitors (2i) down-regulate these enzymes, and have reduced DNA methylation levels (<a href=\"#bib36\">Leitch et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Ying et al., 2008</a>). Upon transfer from serum to 2i medium, demethylation occurs with a slow kinetics: several weeks are required to reach 20\u201330% of CpG methylation. Notably, imprinted genes, major satellite repeats and IAP elements maintain persistent DNA methylation after 2i adaptation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ficz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Habibi et al., 2013</a>). Addition of vitamin C (vitC) can also lower the ES cell methylome.

By combining DNA methylation, chromatin and transcriptional profiling of transposons along with genetic analyses, we found that DNA methylation represses multiple families of transposons in ES cells, but an epigenetic switch towards histone-based control is progressively implemented as DNA methylation disappears. Importantly, we reveal for the first time the specific and overlapping roles of H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation in controlling distinct transposon families upon DNA demethylation. These findings have important implications for understanding the molecular underpinning of transposon control in the pluripotent cells of the early mammalian embryo."

Available methylome maps indicate that 71% and 30% of CpG sites are methylated in serum and in 2i-only conditions, respectively (<a href=\"#bib20\">Habibi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Seisenberger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>); in contrast, ES cells grown in 2i+vitC were almost completely unmethylated, with an average CpG methylation of 4.6%, which is fully consistent with the LUMA quantification (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Low methylation levels were homogeneously found throughout all genomic compartments, including single-copy genic regions and repeated sequences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In particular, all transposable element families (ERVs, LINEs and SINEs) were affected by 2i+vitC-induced demethylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In an attempt to identify individual genomic regions with significant DNA methylation traces (<a href=\"#bib64\">Song et al., 2013</a>), we uncovered 4,100 Residually Methylated Regions (RMRs) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>), which exhibited an average of 26% of CpG methylation after long-term 2i+vitC conversion. These were also regions prone to high DNA methylation retention in 2i-only conditions (65% of CpG methylation). We estimated that nearly 75% of the RMRs overlapped with repeated sequences, among which half belonged to the ERVK class. This confirmed the specific ability of these elements, which includes IAPs, to resist genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation. One quarter of the repeat-associated RMRs overlapped with LINEs, however specifically localized around 5\u2019 UTR regions; in contrast, ERVK-associated RMRs encompassed the entire length of these elements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Notably, Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs), which are usually protected against DNA methylation erasure in 2i conditions, were devoid of any residual DNA methylation in 2i+vitC (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1D,E</a>)."

                                "text": "Using the serum to 2i+vitC medium conversion system, we investigated how transposable elements transcriptionally respond to an acute loss of DNA methylation. Through a time-course RT-qPCR analysis of steady-state levels of three classes of retrotranscripts (LINE1, IAPEz and MERVL), we observed a two-phase pattern: <i>1)</i> an initial up-regulation, which culminates at day 6 (D6) of 2i+vitC conversion, when genomic methylation reaches a low plateau, then <i>2)</i> re-silencing in the absence of DNA methylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This was confirmed by amplification-free Nanostring nCounter quantification and further extended to VL30 elements (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To rule out background-specific effects, we exposed serum-cultured E14 ES cells to 2i+vitC (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Despite some differences in the magnitude of transposon de-repression observed between the J1 and E14 cell lines, the same biphasic pattern of regulation was reproduced. By contrast, the quantity of transposon transcripts remained constant during the conversion from serum to 2i-only or from serum to serum+vitC (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which further underscores the synergistic effect of 2i and vitC in releasing DNA methylation-based repression of transposons. Importantly, the transposon transcription burst did not occur upon conversion of <i>Dnmt-</i>tKO cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Rapid transition from a methylated to an unmethylated state seems to provide a window for transposon reactivation; this is in agreement with the hypothesis that <i>Dnmt</i>-tKO ES cells have likely acquired long-term compensatory mechanisms preventing this relaxation."

Typically, to map transposons, the choice is either to allow multiple hits at the expense of specificity, or to consider unique reads only and lose substantial information. Here, we combined the two methods, in order to provide in-depth characterization of the dynamics of transposon regulation at the familial level, while bringing insights into intra-familial heterogeneity. We further improved transposon mapping by correcting the RepeatMasker annotation (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>), which tends to overestimate the number of transposon entities by counting a unique element as several individual fragments. This is systematic for ERVs, which are split into internal and LTR sequences, but can also concern any type of transposons with small internal deletions or insertions. Using bioinformatic resources allowing the assembly of different fragments of an element (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bailly-Bechet et al., 2014</a>), our reconstructed version gave a census of 588,739 LINEs and 497,706 ERVs, while the original annotation roughly doubles these numbers, with 989,411 LINEs and 969,096 ERVs. Finally, we assigned an integrity score to each element (1 being the maximum), taking into account deletions, insertions and the divergence rate from the consensus sequence. Using a cutoff of 0.8, we predicted a number of 37,194 relatively intact LINEs (6.3% of total LINE elements) and 15,604 ERVs (3.1%) in the mouse reference genome."

Most importantly, it uncovered unprecedented details into the diverse regulation of individual transposons. Expression levels were the most homogeneous among elements of the same family during the D6 de-repression phase.

A relevant example is the <i>Dazl</i> gene, which was continuously up-regulated from D0 to D13 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), reflecting its sensitivity to vitC (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blaschke et al., 2013</a>).

To functionally exclude this possibility, we examined ES cells lacking the EHMT2 H3K9 dimethyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tachibana et al., 2002</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). As previously described, when cultured in serum, <i>Ehmt2</i>-KO ES cells did not exhibit significant up-regulation of transposons as measured by Nanostring, with the exception of MERVL elements (<a href=\"#bib40\">Macfarlan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Maksakova et al., 2013</a>). Upon 2i+vitC conversion, while LINE1 elements behaved as in WT cells, IAPEz and MERVL expression was enhanced around D6 in <i>Ehmt2</i>-KO cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). As H3K9me2 cannot be detected after D3 at these sequences (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), this relative up-regulation likely occurs through indirect effects. Most importantly, <i>Ehmt2</i> mutants exhibited transposon re-silencing after D6, which excludes a role for H3K9me2 in compensating the loss of DNA methylation-dependent repression."

Neither the total number of H3K9me3 peaks (39424 at D0 and 38554 at D15), nor their preferential occurrence on transposons was significantly altered during the conversion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, the number of H3K27me3-enriched regions raised four fold from D0 to D15 (9663 to 40098). The vast majority of newly gained H3K27me3 peaks were located in ERV and LINE1 repeats, at the expense of gene promoters (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We also observed a gradual H3K27me3 re-localization to pericentric heterochromatin during the conversion, by ChIP-qPCR at major satellite repeats (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), by immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and by mapping ChIP-seq reads to the major satellite consensus sequence (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Redistribution of H3K27me3 from gene promoters towards satellite repeats was previously reported in 2i-only conditions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Marks et al., 2012</a>). However, increased H3K27me3 levels and subsequent accumulation at different transposon repeats seems specific to the globally hypomethylated genome of 2i+vitC-cultured cells. Accordingly, hypomethylated <i>Dnmt</i>-tKO ES cells grown in serum displayed similar H3K27me3 redistribution towards transposons when we analyzed available ChIP-seq data (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

Interestingly, bisulfite-pyrosequencing analysis of H3K4me3- or H3K9me3-immunoprecipitated chromatin confirmed, as expected, that active LINE1 elements (marked by H3K4me3) had lower DNA methylation levels compared to inactive ones (marked by H3K9me3)(<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>).

One noticeable exception was RLTR4, which exhibited a strong H3K27me3 signal (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Interestingly, this element is 90% identical to MuLV, which is one of the few transposons up-regulated in polycomb-deficient ES cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Leeb et al., 2010</a>). Upon 2i+vitC conversion, H3K9me3 levels remained largely constant, although patterns observed in serum tended to be exacerbated: families with the initial highest enrichment (IAPEz, RLTR6 and MMERVK10C) were further enriched for this mark, while families with modest enrichment (MERVL, MURVY or the MalR-class L ORR1A and ORR1B) tended to lose it. Meanwhile, H3K27me3 progressively accumulated at most transposons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), and this gain was variable among families: from inexistent for IAPEz to moderate for LINEs and VL30, and to strong for various ERVs."

This suggests that internal ERV sequences are important for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 recruitment. IAP elements were an exception, as their solo-LTRs were enriched for H3K9me3 on their own."

Although the whole picture is quite complex, it can be concluded that medium-induced DNA methylation profoundly remodels the repressive chromatin landscape of transposons. From a universal H3K9me3 occupancy in serum, transposon families exhibited three general trends in 2i+vitC: <i>A)</i> co-occupancy of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (LINEs, MMERGLN, RLTR6, RLTR10, IAPEy, VL30), <i>B)</i> exclusive H3K9me3 occupation (IAPEz, MMERVK10C), and <i>C)</i> complete switch from H3K9me2/3 to H3K27me3-regulated chromatin (MERVL and MURVY) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>).

Nevertheless, to gain insight into the question of intra-familial heterogeneity, we plotted H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 enrichment for every intact transposons (score&gt;0.8) per family during the conversion. We found that elements of the B and C categories tended to be very homogeneous. IAPEz elements (category B) collectively gained H3K9me3 from D0 to D6; the MERVL and the Y-specific MURVY families (category C) also showed compact patterns, with individual elements transitioning together from H3K9me3 enrichment at D0 to H3K27me3 at D15 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The A category, which is enriched for both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, was more diverse, with some families displaying homogeneous patterns, while others showed intra-familial dispersion in chromatin fates upon conversion. Within the MMERGLN, RLTR6 or RLTR10 families, all elements gained H3K27me3 while maintaining or gaining high levels of H3K9me3. Within the L1-T and IAPEy families, the majority of elements gained H3K27me3, but a subset maintained H3K9me3 without acquiring H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Another case of intra-familial heterogeneity is provided by RLTR4, which specifically carries H3K27me3 marks at D0 in serum: we demonstrate here that this enrichment was restricted to a small proportion of elements, as was previously suspected (<a href=\"#bib51\">Reichmann et al., 2012</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). By extracting single-element information from RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, it is clear that both transcriptional and chromatin heterogeneity exists among some transposon families. Our analysis reveals that caution should be taken when interpreting average familial behaviors, as they may be representative of only a few individual elements inside a given family."

Through genetic analyses, we aimed to discern the functional relevance of these marks in controlling the three categories of transposons that we defined. Regarding H3K9me3-dependent pathways, we used CRISPR/Cas9 editing to generate a double-knockout ES cell line for the H3K9 trimethyltransferases, SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 (<i>Suv39h</i>-dKO). Additionally we created haploinsufficient mutants for H3K9 trimethyltransferase SETDB1 (<i>Setdb1</i> +/-) and its TRIM28 co-repressor (<i>Trim28</i> +/-) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>); complete SETDB1 or TRIM28 removal is not compatible with ES cell survival (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dodge et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rowe et al., 2010</a>). The role of H3K27me3 was studied in mutant ES cells for the EED protein (<i><a href=\"#bib57\">Eed-KO, Schoeftner et al., 2006</a>),</i> which is required for H3K27me3 catalysis by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</a>). <i>Eed-</i>KO ES cells experienced massive cell death around D8 of conversion, but slowly recovered in the following days (data not shown). Finally, in order to study compensatory mechanisms between H3K9 and H3K27 pathways, we deleted EED in <i>Suv39h</i>-dKO ES cells, generating <i>Suv39-Eed</i> triple-knockout lines (<i>Suv39h-Eed-</i>tKO) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). <i>Suv39-Eed</i>-tKO ES cells were viable with a reduced proliferation rate when grown in serum, but did not survive more than a week when converted to 2i+vitC (data not shown). Nanostring quantification of transposon transcripts was performed upon serum to 2i+vitC transfer of these five cell lines, which, importantly, share the same J1 cell background."

Previous studies concluded that L1 repression in serum relies on SUV39H-dependent H3K9me3 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</a>): through the analysis of our genetic mutants, we found this was the case for L1-A, and very modestly for L1-T elements (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Moreover, LINE1 expression was significantly upregulated at the end of the conversion of <i>Setdb1</i> +/- ES cells, suggesting an important role for SETDB1-mediated repression upon DNA methylation loss. In regards to the role of polycomb, RNA-seq analysis of <i>Eed-</i>KO ES cells revealed that absence of polycomb had little effect on transposons in ES cells with a methylated genome (at D0 of conversion). In contrast, many transposon families, including the different young LINE1 subtypes that belong to the A category, were strongly activated in fully 2i+vitC-converted <i>Eed</i>-KO cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>): polycomb-mediated silencing is therefore involved in controlling these transposons, specifically in absence of DNA methylation. Interestingly, ERV families that gain H3K27me3 uniquely in their 3\u2019 end \u2013 such as MMERGLN, RLTR6 or RLTR10 \u2013 were not misregulated in absence of EED; this suggests that 3\u2019 end deposition of H3K27me3 does not drive their transcriptional repression."

Although this profile would predict a continuous and exclusive dependence towards H3K9me3 upon medium adaptation, we observed complex behaviors in the different mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). During conversion, <i>Trim28+/-</i> and <i>Setdb1</i>+/- cells showed enhanced IAPEz up-regulation and repression failure after D6, in line with a major role of SETDB1-related H3K9me3 for controlling these elements in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Matsui et al., 2010</a>). However, SUV39H depletion led to an unexpected IAPEz suppression upon conversion. One possible explanation is that <i>Suv39h</i>-dKO cells have acquired long-term compensatory mechanisms that prevent transient IAPEz activation upon DNA methylation loss. Moreover, IAPEz elements were more strongly expressed in <i>Eed</i>-KO compared to WT cells during conversion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), which is at odds with their apparent lack of H3K27me3 enrichment in ChIP-seq data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E,F</a>). Analysis of individual elements showed that this activation did not emanate from a few discrete elements but represented a general trend (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7C</a>).

SUV39H-dependent H3K9me3 became dispensable for MERVL silencing upon 2i+vitC conversion, and the switch towards H3K27me3 control was perfectly correlated with a 15-fold expression increase in <i>Eed</i>-KO cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). RNA-seq analysis indicates that MERVL was actually the most highly activated transposon in absence of EED, as a result of a collective upregulation of all individual elements (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). MERVL therefore represents a striking model of epigenetic switch from H3K9 to H3K27 methylation-based repression, which occurs subsequently to DNA methylation loss.

This was achieved through detailed kinetic assessment of transcription and chromatin states during conversion of WT ES cells from serum to 2i+vitC media, as a way to reproduce the DNA methylation erasure that occurs during embryogenesis. Despite their heterogeneous origins and structures, we found that various transposon families residing in the mouse genome adopted a common regulatory fate: after an initial transcriptional burst, repression was re-established in a DNA methylation-independent manner. Distinct combinations of H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me3 were observed among transposon families, defining three functional categories of chromatin-based responses to DNA methylation loss: joint H3K9me3 and H3K27m3 (A), H3K9me3-exclusive (B), and H3K27me3-exclusive (C) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Importantly, <i>Dnmt</i>-tKO cells, which have endured long-term adaptation to a DNA methylation-free state, displayed similar transposon-specific chromatin patterns when grown in serum, which excludes a medium-related effect. In conclusion, our work revises the previous assumption that DNA methylation is dispensable for transposon silencing in ES cells; rather, we reveal here that various histone-based repression strategies are implemented upon DNA methylation loss, thereby safeguarding pluripotent cells against a multitude of heterogeneous transposon entities."

This supports previous evidence that H3K9me3 can confer protection against DNA demethylation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Leung et al., 2014</a>). Inversely, the rapid disappearance of H3K9me2 upon serum to 2i+vitC conversion could reflect a direct role of DNA methylation in the maintenance of these marks. Accordingly, H3K9me2 reduction was also observed in DNA methylation-free <i>Dnmt-</i>tKO ES cells grown in serum (data not shown).

H3K27me3 is barely detectable at transposons in DNA hypermethylated WT ES cells grown in serum; in contrast, transposons accumulate H3K27me3 in both 2i+vitC-converted cells and in serum-grown <i>Dnmt-</i>tKO cells. This is in line with the prevailing notion that DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are mutually exclusive genome-wide and that DNA methylation antagonizes H3K27me3 deposition (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brinkman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jermann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tanay et al., 2007</a>). Saliently, this raises the question as to how transposons acquire H3K27me3 upon DNA methylation loss. In mammalian genomes, polycomb is typically targeted to unmethylated GC-rich gene promoters (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jermann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mendenhall et al., 2010</a>). Notably, transposon sequences have a GC content superior to the genome average (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>): this signature could be sufficient to attract polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 deposition in the absence of DNA methylation. Intermediate methyl-sensitive DNA binding proteins may be involved: the BEND3 protein was recently identified as a sensor of DNA methylation states at pericentromeric repeats, recruiting polycomb-dependent H3K27me3 marks in <i>Dnmt</i>-tKO ES cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Saksouk et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, we also observed H3K27me3 relocalization towards pericentromeric repeats in hypomethylated 2i+vitC ES cells. Similarly, the H3K36 demethylase KDM2B, which targets unmethylated CpG-rich sequences, was shown to recruit PRC1, potentially leading to H3K27me3 deposition through PRC2 recruitment (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blackledge et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Farcas et al., 2012</a>). Comparable mechanisms might be at play for the recruitment of H3K27me3 at hypomethylated transposons, involving BEND3, KDM2B and/or other methyl-sensitive DNA binding proteins."

Moreover, we provide evidence that the three possible chromatin configurations that the different transposon families adopt are further determined by H3K9me3 occupancy (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Mutual exclusion between H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks has been previously documented at gene promoters and pericentromeric repeats (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Peters et al., 2003</a>), but not at transposons. We found that category B transposons, which constantly maintain H3K9me3 marks throughout their entire length, do not acquire H3K27me3-based chromatin even though they lose DNA methylation. In contrast, category C transposons, exemplified by MERVL elements, become strongly enriched for H3K27me3 as H3K9me2/3 depletes during medium conversion. Finally, category A elements provide a striking illustration of the physical segregation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3: as H3K9me3 constitutively marks the 5\u2019 end of this transposon category, only their 3\u2019 end is accessible to H3K27me3 deposition upon DNA methylation loss. The presence of H3K27me3 at the 3\u2019 end of transcription units has not been described before and its functional significance was unknown. Our transcriptome analysis of 2i+vitC-converted <i>Eed</i>-KO cells reveals that 3\u2019 end enrichment of H3K27me3 does not confer transcriptional repression of transposons of the A category: it may rather represent a passive response to the lack of DNA methylation and H3K9me3 at this position."

We cannot rule out that other mechanisms-such as small RNA-based post-transcriptional repression-could also participate to transposon control. Importantly, genetic analyses globally confirmed the functionality of the chromatin patterns that we identified. In particular, H3K27me3-dependency was very well illustrated by the failure to repress several transposon families \u2013 in particular MERVL and LINE1\u2013 in <i>Eed</i>-KO ES cells undergoing medium-based DNA methylation loss. However, the transposon category B (IAPEz), which remains enriched for H3K9me3 throughout media conversion, gave complex, disparate phenotypes in the mutants of the different H3K9me3 pathways. While these elements failed to be repressed in <i>Setdb1</i> and <i>Trim28</i>-deficient ES cells, the complete suppression of IAPEz reactivation in <i>Suv39</i>-dko cells was unexpected. We suspect that alternative repressive processes likely obscure IAPEz transcriptional responses to DNA methylation loss in this mutant. This is akin to <i>Dnmt</i>-tKO cells, which also exhibit global transposon repression. Thus, our analyses highlight the possible unexplained phenotypes of mutant cells that have adapted to long-term chromatin-based deficiencies."

                        "text": "Finally, one important point to raise is that the epigenetic switch from a DNA methylation-dependent to -independent mode of transposon silencing is not perfectly synchronized: ES cells experience an acute burst of transposon expression at D6 of medium conversion. At this time point, we showed that DNA methylation has been mostly erased but H3K27me3 patterns have not been established yet. Interestingly, the stability of H3K9me3 marks at category A and B transposons is not sufficient to ensure their continuous silencing upon conversion. This may imply that H3K9me3 readers are transiently deficient in this system. The lag between DNA methylation loss and subsequent implementation of histone-based repression could create an opportunistic window for transposon reactivation, provided that adequate transcription factors are available. Several studies have previously pointed out that transposons are enriched in pluripotency transcription factor binding motifs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kunarso et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), in particular for NANOG and OCT4, and that upregulation of these transcription factors was sufficient to promote transposon expression (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grow et al., 2015</a>)."

After a brief silencing release, functional repressive chromatin is recovered, in an H3K9me3 and/or H3K27me3-dependent manner. Notably, we repeatedly observed a peak of massive cell death of H3K27me3-deficient <i>Eed</i>-KO ES cells between D6 and D10 of medium conversion, when DNA methylation has mostly disappeared. This phenotype was even exacerbated in <i>Suv39h-Eed</i>-tKO ES cells, which did not survive after a week of medium conversion. These observations support the critical role for H3K27me3 in supplementing DNA methylation-based control in ES cells."

The paper focuses on the analysis of altered histone modification patterns following a global and very general (i.e. genome wide) 2i+VitC induced DNA-demethylation. The major findings are: i) A burst of initial DNA-demethylation causes distinct patterns of initial transcriptional derepression which ii) appears to be differentially compensated by an element specific gain of heterochromatic marks leading iii) to a partial re-silencing. The paper provides a very deep and differentiated view on transposon control in murine ES cells. The data provides a detailed analysis of the complex dynamics and interplay of different layers of heterochromatic marks. The main finding is that different classes of (retro-) transposons are controlled by partially redundant but distinct networks of heterochromatic histone marks in ESCs. In addition the paper provides an excellent resource of unique DNA-methylation and ChIP-Seq data."

The straight forward bioinformatic comparative analyses culminates in the definition of three epigenetic \"ground\" states (A, B and C). Using (and generating) genetic manipulations the authors also aim to unravel functional links between the heterochromatic control and enzyme contributions. These analyses are well performed but do not provide many novel insights in the biology of transposon control."

This goes against the current dogma that suggests that DNA methylation is dispensable in ESCs (based on the use of Dnmt 3KO ESCs.) The authors nicely demonstrate that there is a phase of transposon expression following the rapid demethylation, followed by resilencing of transposons. Using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and bioinformatics approaches, they identify different classes of transposons based on the mechanisms of re-silencing, which includes polycomb-dependent H3K27me3. This paper is logical, very clearly written, and very nicely carried out, however there are a few concerns that should be addressed before I can recommend publication."

However, the observed upregulation of transposons (e.g. IAPez, 3-fold, MERVL, 2-fold) is rather weak upon demethylation (as compared to what is observed in KAP1 and ESET KO ES cells (IAP) or LSD1 KOs (MERVL)). Furthermore, as the authors comment themselves, the upregulation of pluripotency transcription factors upon demethylation could be responsible for the observed ERV reactivation. The authors also show that more than 3000 other genes are up- or down-regulated during conversion; many of those genes might influence transposon expression/repression. I cannot think of a way to exclude these potential indirect effects but the authors should mention that some the observed transposon upregulation might not be directly caused by loss of DNA methylation at these elements and be more careful in implying that DNA methylation is generally required for transposon silencing in ES cells. It rather seems that some ERVs that are not marked by H3K9me3 (e.g. MERVL) require both DNA methylation and H3K27me3 to remain in a repressed state in certain culture conditions whereas DNA demethylation has very little (maybe merely indirect) effects on ERVs repressed by the KAP1/ESET system."

The authors should indicate the CpG content in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> to test such an association. Also, it is possible that increased transcription results in H3K27me3 enrichment. It would be interesting to plot the transcriptional activity of all uniquely mappable transposons against their H3K27me3 enrichment to test this possibility. If possible, the authors could also try to analyze H3K27me3 at fragmented transposons (e.g. ERVs without LTRs or LTRs without internal regions) to define the regions that are essential for H3K27me3 targeting."

The ability to measure temporal changes in this system allowed the authors to observe a transient upregulation of transposable element expression associated with a change in histone modifications at these sites. Specifically, across all subfamilies of repetitive elements, the authors observed three patterns of histone modification changes during hypomethylation: (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) gain of both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, (<a href=\"#bib2\">2</a>) exclusive H3K9me3 occupancy, and (<a href=\"#bib3\">3</a>) a switch from H3K9me3 to H3K27me3 occupancy. Notably, subfamilies within the first group, including LINEs and subfamilies of ERV1 and ERVK, showed heterogeneity of behavior and a spatial segregation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 with H3K9me3 preferentially located at the 5' end and H3K27me3 located at the 3' end. The authors lastly aimed to test ideas about histone repression of transposable elements using isogenic mES cell knockouts of chromatin modifying enzymes, Suv39h, Kap1, and Eed, responsible for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. The results show a complexity between chromatin modifiers with some consistent and others unexplained by the data. Overall, this study provided an interesting observation of two repressive modifications implicated in repression of transposable elements in the place of DNA methylation in order to understand regulation of these elements during developmental stages of hypomethylation."

The authors have to consider the issue of cell heterogeneity in mid of 2i+vitC treatment (e.g. D6), which may lead to the different interpretations of their data. For example, it has been demonstrated that DNA hypomethylation-mediated de-repression of retrotransposons is associated with the degree of cell differentiation state (e.g. Hutnick et al. PMID 20404320, to be cited in this manuscript). When ESCs are grown in serum conditions, the 2i+vitC treatment would impose a selection, leading to the transient differentiation of a subset of ESCs in the time course. Therefore, as recently done by Grow EJ et al. (Nature 2015), the authors should perform immunocytochemistry or FISH analysis of ESCs to rule out the burst of transient de-repression of retrotransposons is only taking place in a subset of differentiated cells after 6days of 2i+vitC treatment. Alternatively, multiplex single cell RT-PCR assays of ESCs with transposons and cell differentiation markers may also resolve this critical issue."

However, the observed upregulation of transposons (e.g. IAPez, 3-fold, MERVL, 2-fold) is rather weak upon demethylation (as compared to what is observed in KAP1 and ESET KO ES cells (IAP) or LSD1 KOs (MERVL)). Furthermore, as the authors comment themselves, the upregulation of pluripotency transcription factors upon demethylation could be responsible for the observed ERV reactivation. The authors also show that more than 3000 other genes are up- or down-regulated during conversion; many of those genes might influence transposon expression/repression. I cannot think of a way to exclude these potential indirect effects but the authors should mention that some the observed transposon upregulation might not be directly caused by loss of DNA methylation at these elements and be more careful in implying that DNA methylation is generally required for transposon silencing in ES cells. It rather seems that some ERVs that are not marked by H3K9me3 (e.g. MERVL) require both DNA methylation and H3K27me3 to remain in a repressed state in certain culture conditions whereas DNA demethylation has very little (maybe merely indirect) effects on ERVs repressed by the KAP1/ESET system.</i> "

The authors have to consider the issue of cell heterogeneity in mid of 2i+vitC treatment (e.g. D6), which may lead to the different interpretations of their data. For example, it has been demonstrated that DNA hypomethylation-mediated de-repression of retrotransposons is associated with the degree of cell differentiation state (e.g. Hutnick et al. PMID 20404320, to be cited in this manuscript). When ESCs are grown in serum conditions, the 2i+vitC treatment would impose a selection, leading to the transient differentiation of a subset of ESCs in the time course.</i> "

So indeed, we noticed some level of cellular heterogeneity in LINE1 expression among cells, but the same level of inter-cellular heterogeneity is present throughout the conversion process from D0 to D12, and, most importantly, is not different at the time of transcription burst (D6). In summary, what changes at D6 is the level of expression (as assessed by immunofluorescence intensity), not the number of expressing cells.
