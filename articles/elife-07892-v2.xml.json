Mutant mice with cerebellar circuit defects exhibit characteristic impairments in locomotor coordination; however, the fundamental features of this gait ataxia have not been effectively isolated. Here we describe a novel system (LocoMouse) for analyzing limb, head, and tail kinematics of freely walking mice. Analysis of visibly ataxic <i>Purkinje cell degeneration</i> (<i>pcd</i>) mice reveals that while differences in the forward motion of individual paws are fully accounted for by changes in walking speed and body size, more complex 3D trajectories and, especially, inter-limb and whole-body coordination are specifically impaired. Moreover, the coordination deficits in <i>pcd</i> are consistent with a failure to predict and compensate for the consequences of movement across the body. These results isolate specific impairments in whole-body coordination in mice and provide a quantitative framework for understanding cerebellar contributions to coordinated locomotion."

Mutant mice with cerebellar circuit defects exhibit characteristic impairments in locomotor coordination; however, the fundamental features of this gait ataxia have not been effectively isolated. Here we describe a novel system (LocoMouse) for analyzing limb, head, and tail kinematics of freely walking mice. Analysis of visibly ataxic <i>Purkinje cell degeneration</i> (<i>pcd</i>) mice reveals that while differences in the forward motion of individual paws are fully accounted for by changes in walking speed and body size, more complex 3D trajectories and, especially, inter-limb and whole-body coordination are specifically impaired. Moreover, the coordination deficits in <i>pcd</i> are consistent with a failure to predict and compensate for the consequences of movement across the body. These results isolate specific impairments in whole-body coordination in mice and provide a quantitative framework for understanding cerebellar contributions to coordinated locomotion."

Instead, however, the mutants were found to have specific difficulties coordinating movement across the body. The movements of the mutant mice's front and hind paws, for example, did not follow the same coordinated pattern as the typical mice. The mutant mice also swung their head and tail in an exaggerated way. Machado, Darmohray et al.'s analysis revealed that these movements likely resulted from a failure of the cerebellum of the mutant mice to predict and compensate for the motion of the rest of the body. Other scientists will now likely use the LocoMouse system to study mouse movements and how the brain controls them."

For example, during walking, leg, arm, trunk, and head movements need to be coordinated to achieve a stable, smooth, and efficient gait. The cerebellum is critical for coordinated locomotion; cerebellar damage leads to characteristic gait ataxia across species. Exactly how the cerebellum contributes to motor coordination, however, remains controversial."

In addition to their amenability to genetic circuit dissection, their small size makes it possible to analyze even unrestrained, relatively complex whole-body actions within a laboratory setting. Moreover, several spontaneous mutants have been identified based on visible gait ataxia (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mullen et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Walter et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cendelin, 2014</a>). These mutants exhibit abnormal cell patterning within the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brooks and Dunnett, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sheets et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cendelin, 2014</a>). While traditional gait analyses in ataxic mutants have reported a variety of impairments in individual limb movements and interlimb coordination (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fortier et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Vinueza Veloz et al., 2014</a>), many of these findings are not specific to ataxia and could represent secondary consequences of changes in walking speed (<a href=\"#bib6\">Batka et al., 2014</a>). Therefore it has not been clear to what extent exisiting analyses of mouse locomotion capture the essence of the coordination deficits of ataxic mice that are so visible to the human eye (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cendelin et al., 2010</a>)."

We used LocoMouse to establish a quantitative framework for locomotor coordination in mice and analyze the deficits of visibly ataxic <i>Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd)</i> mutants. Surprisingly, we find that the forward motion of individual paws is normal in <i>pcd</i>\u2014apparent differences in basic stride parameters and forward trajectories disappeared once changes in body size and walking speed were taken into account. In contrast, 3D paw trajectories, interlimb and whole-body coordination were specifically impaired. Moreover, the prominent nose and tail oscillations observed in <i>pcd</i> were successfully modeled as passive consequences of the forward motion of the hind limbs, suggesting the absence of a mechanism that normally predicts and compensates for movements of other parts of the body. Taken together, these results suggest a specific failure to predict the consequences of movement across joints, limbs, and body, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum provides a forward model for motor control (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bastian et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ebner and Pasalar, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kennedy et al., 2014</a>)."

Each parameter measured, including stride length, cadence, swing velocity, and stance duration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>), varied consistently with the walking speed of the mouse. Cadence and stride length increased with walking speed, indicating that faster walking in mice is associated with longer, more frequent strides (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clarke and Still, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Batka et al., 2014</a>).

Further subdividing the data by the body weight of each animal (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) revealed that much of the remaining variability in each parameter could be accounted for by the mouse's body size (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, color-coded by weight)."

For each parameter, we first linearized the data by fitting appropriate functions (e.g., linear, power) to the data with respect to walking speed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Then we generated a multilevel linear mixed-effects model that included potential predictor variables speed, weight, body length, age, and gender either alone or in combination and asked to what extent they accurately predicted the measured parameter. This analysis revealed that the value of each stride parameter was readily predicted based solely on walking speed and body weight (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While basic stride parameters also varied with gender and age, these effects were related to differences in body size (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); adding neither age nor gender improved the predictions once body size was taken into account.

In other words, it appears that the walking speed of <i>pcd</i> mice is limited by the need to have at least one hind paw on the ground, for postural stability (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stolze et al., 2002</a>)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, the tail oscillations of <i>pcd</i> mice were fit very well, across walking speeds and tail segments, with a passive model that incorporated a 31 ms time delay for the base of the tail (reflecting the initial inertia of the mouse's rear) plus a fixed delay per additional tail segment (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). A similar model for the nose (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) was also consistent with a time-delayed (96 ms) side-to-side nose movement in <i>pcd</i>. Importantly, these oscillations cannot be accounted for by differences in hind limbs between control and <i>pcd</i>, because: (1) hindpaw alternation is unaltered in <i>pcd</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>); (2) hindlimb double support is unaltered in pcd (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>); and (3) though the base of support is wider in <i>pcd</i>, the model predicts that this difference alone would result in smaller, not larger tail oscillations in <i>pcd</i>.

The high spatiotemporal resolution and throughput of this system provides the most comprehensive description of locomotor kinematics in freely walking mice to-date and allowed us to develop a novel analysis framework for mouse locomotion that revealed fundamental features of gait ataxia. Our main findings are (1) Basic paw stride parameters can be predicted solely based on walking speed and body size. (2) This relationship holds in visibly ataxic <i>pcd</i> mutants, indicating that changes in these stride parameters in ataxic mice do not reflect fundamental features of ataxia. (3) While the forward motion of the paws is spared in <i>pcd</i>, coordination across joints, limbs, and the body is selectively impaired. (4) The nose and tail of <i>pcd</i> mice oscillate as a passive consequence of forward hindlimb motion. Taken together, this pattern of deficits reveals that gait ataxia in <i>pcd</i> mice involves specific impairments in locomotor coordination across joints, limbs, and body parts."

We found that while on-axis paw kinematics are preserved in the absence of cerebellar cortical output, the ability to predict and actively cancel the passive consequences of movements of other parts of the body appears to be beyond the limits of compensatory mechanisms available to <i>pcd</i> mice. Therefore our results raise the intriguing possibility that the absence of forward models, rather than a failure to execute appropriate movement kinematics per se, could form the basis for impaired coordination associated with gait ataxia in mice."

Mice were filmed crossing the corridor with a high-resolution, high-speed camera (Bonito CL-400B, Allied Vision Technologies, <a href=\"https://www.alliedvision.com\">https://www.alliedvision.com</a>). A mirror (66 cm \u00d7 16 cm) was placed below the corridor at an angle of \u223c45\u00b0 to allow simultaneous collection of side and bottom views in order to generate three-dimensional tracking data. Lighting consisted of a matrix of LEDs that emitted cool white light positioned to maximize contrast and reduce reflection. Infrared sensors positioned along the runway automatically triggered the camera and acquisition software once the mouse entered the corridor and stopped the acquisition once the mouse reached the other end of the corridor or after 25 s."

Fewer than 10% of the trials were excluded due to tracking failure (typically due to exploration or grooming behavior that resulted in erroneous swing and stance point detection).

Positive examples were hand labeled on a set of 81 images from a single training video while 10 negative examples for each feature were randomly picked from the same images. Training the 6 SVM classifiers took approximately 1 hr on a machine with an Intel Core i7-3770 CPU and 16 GB or RAM. All experiments were performed with these SVM classifiers with no need to retrain on additional data. For each trial, the candidate locations for each feature were obtained by filtering the input images with the trained detectors. For the paws and snout, the resulting image regions were clustered into a small number of point locations using a standard non-maxima suppression algorithm. Once the candidate features were identified by the SVM, we considered the temporal trajectories and selected the candidate tracks that maximized per image detection scores while minimizing frame-by-frame displacement with a method based on existing multi-target tracking frameworks (<a href=\"#bib47\">Russell et al., 2011</a>) that formulate tracking as the maximum a posteriori probability estimation over a Bayesian network of candidate locations on each image. Best bottom view tracks (x and y) were computed first and then the best side view track (z, accounting for image distortion from the optics) that matched the bottom view track was selected. For the tail, the interest regions were matched across views and the largest resulting 3D region was picked as the final detection. The tail was detected independently for every image. Following computation of feature tracks, pixel values were converted to millimeters for further analysis."

The two projections of the object were detected by thresholding the (grayscale) image at 80% (after removing the background). The horizontal line splitting the image into the bottom and side views was defined manually at this point. The corrective image transformation makes the bottom and side projections of the object match along the vertical line and was computed via least squares. The corrective transformation depends on the position of the camera relative to the setup and was performed once for every configuration.

To account for occlusions and noise, the final size of the bounding box was defined as the smaller of the mean size plus three standard deviations, and the maximum observed size.

(1) First, we estimated the desired stride parameters for each hind paw. The temporal parameters of the stride (swing, stance and stride durations) were taken from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, calculated for an animal of 15g (small animal control). We calculated the stride lengths by estimating the final desired position of the paw (relative to the nose of the animal) at the end of the stride; this value was also taken from small animal control data. (2) We calculated the forward trajectory for each paw using a constant swing velocity model given by the stride length divided by the swing duration. We then calculated the periodic forward oscillations of the two hind paws by calculating the difference between their forward trajectories. The phasing of hind paw alternation was taken from the small animal control data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). (3) Finally, we converted the forward movements of the paws into lateral movements of the tail and nose. We calculated tail and nose trajectories that would be predicted from a purely passive coupling of forward motion of the hind paws with lateral tail/nose motion through the geometric relations <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\">\u2192</mo></mover></mrow><mo>\u22a5</mo><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>L</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\">\u2192</mo></mover></mrow></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\">\u2192</mo></mover></mrow><mo>\u22a5</mo><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>L</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\">\u2192</mo></mover></mrow></mrow></math> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We bisected the line segment that connects the two hind paws, with an orthogonal line segment (CD). For each tail segment S<sub>i</sub>, at each timestep t, we define a vector with constant length, originating in A, along the direction<math id=\"inf3\"><mrow><mo>\u00a0</mo><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\">\u2192</mo></mover></mrow></mrow></math> (gray points along the line AC). The lateral position of each segment of the tail was then given by S<sub>yi</sub> = Li sin \u03b8, where Li is the distance between the center of tail oscillation (A) and segment i, and \u03b8 is the angle between segment (AC) and the anterior\u2013posterior axis of the animal. Similarly, for the nose, we defined a vector with constant length, originating in A, along the direction<math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><mo>\u00a0</mo><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>D</mi><mi>A</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"true\">\u2192</mo></mover></mrow></mrow></math>.

The time delays for the nose and base of the tail were estimated by linear regression on a plot of phase as a function of stride frequency (cadence) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Delays between subsequent tail segments decreased according to the equation delay = \u22120.23 *i + 3.97, where i is the segment number, starting at the base of the tail."

There are, however, concerns whether the automation procedure is making correct assessments of the locomotor parameters, that gaits are not taken into accounts in the description, that there is a lack of statistical evaluation of intra-limb coordination, and that the differences in full body movements may not account completely for the phenotype. To meet these concerns would require substantial reanalysis of the data and reconsidering the main conclusions of the study. Even with a new analysis there is a feeling that the results presented will mainly be a technical advance rather than a conceptual advance for cerebellar motor function or the locomotor field at large. The reasons for this are that there already are cerebellar specific mutants that have been analyzed in similar ways and that the locomotor data in wild-type are confirmative and lacking gait parameters. For these reasons the manuscript as presently configured is not suitable as a regular paper in <i>eLife</i>. The details of the concerns and suggestions for improvements are detailed in the attached review reports."

For instance, there was a very recent paper by Hoogland et al. (2015, Curr Biol.) introducing a method that is closely related to the present one (camera-based, measuring the paw positions as well as the whole body angle) and other measurement systems applied to locomotion exist in abundance, typically published alongside main scientific findings (for example, Kiehn 2013). To be clear, I think the authors have made a very careful and high-quality job, but I am doubtful that the advances provided here represent a major leap rather than a minor incremental change to the state-of-the art."

But I find that the analysis of the whole body coordination boils down to computing the angle of the mid-body axis by utilizing the recorded position of the nose and tail, which is not particularly useful from a neuroscience perspective, as the angle is determined by the interplay of a very large number of muscles that could potentially change in different ways in a large number of deficits. In addition, data on the whole body movement is already provided in the solution of <a href=\"#bib28\">Hoogland et al. (2015)</a>. I also find that the stated monitoring of the 3D limb kinematics boils down to a monitoring of the 3D spatial position of the paw. But each position could theoretically be accomplished by many different configurations in the muscles of the limb, and the latter is the type of information that one would need to obtain a useful tool. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a> seem at first glance to indicate that there is indeed some information on the limb joints \u2013 however, when I read the paper and the Methods, there are no indications that the joints are actually measured. Hence, I assume that the joint angles are computed out of the 3D paw data, which is problematic. First, if these angles are not measured but computed, the authors must explain where the data in their <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a> comes from. For the paper as a whole, this is a major problem since the main applicability of this setup would be if the user could actually track joint angles. Relying on computational models to deduce the 3D limb kinematics is very different from actually measuring it, and reduces the value of this method."

But there is no evidence here that the cerebellum provides an internal model of any kind. What is seen here is only that block of the normal information processing pathway of various motor systems perturbs the capability of the central nervous system to rely on internal models. On the other hand, all biological motor control is feed-forward in nature, as it needs to deal with long delays, and feed-forward control can be solved only by using internal models. So the only thing learned from this study is that the normal function of the central nervous system in locomotion is dependent on a normally operating cerebellum. The internal models could be generated elsewhere, with the perturbed Purkinje cells destroying the capacity of the system as a whole by removing an otherwise permissive signal to any other system hypothetically responsible for generating/providing the internal model."

The use of <i>pcd</i> mice at ages varying between p41 and p154, therefore, is expected to result in heterogeneous stages of neurodegeneration. This is not addressed experimentally.

However, the authors do not directly disentangle the impact of body weight vs. speed for each parameter. In other words, how much of the variation is explained by either one?

Although the authors show that the trajectory of individual limbs is not grossly affected in <i>pcd</i> mice, the speed is (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). And the speed is in turn related to the velocity of single limbs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, without neglecting the importance of the current study, stating that previous studies were not able to quantitate features of gait ataxia or interlimb coordination is in my opinion too strong. For possibilities of transparent disk treadmill to study interlimb coordination, please refer to <a href=\"#bib28\">Hoogland et al., 2015</a>, Current Biol). Here, the level of ataxia in tottering is not only quantified (including interlimb coordination), but also related to the level of complex spike synchrony. Please discuss this neurobiological mechanism upfront as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the technical possibilities of this disk treadmill system with respect to the current locomouse technology."

This movement is largely exaggerated in <i>pcd</i> mice. Whereas the lateral movements in control mice are coupled to the stride phase, in the <i>pcd</i> mice there seems to be more of a coupling to the time. The tail movements could be either a compensatory mechanism to counteract imbalance due to improper limb control or they could be affected themselves, contributing to further imbalance. Currently, the variations in tail movements are not really taken into account. Could the authors provide a more solid analysis showing whether tail movements are compensatory or affected by themselves?"

However, I find it still difficult to understand the phase relationship between limbs with regard to swing and stance phase. For example, to what extent does the onset of the swing phase of the forelimb occur during the swing or stance phase of the ipsilateral hindlimb? In order to have a better interpretation of inter-limb coordination, it might be worthwhile to add an additional figure with swing and stance phase indicated for each individual limb."

A detailed description of locomotor parameters allowed them to create a mathematical model to predict most of the parameters knowing just the walking speed and the body size of the animal. They extend this analysis to a mouse model for Purkinje cell degeneration (<i>pcd</i>). They conclude that the traditional locomotor parameters (stride length, cadence, intra-limb coordination) and forward trajectories are not different in wild-type mice and <i>pcd</i> mice. In contrast they conclude that the whole-body coordination is specifically impaired in <i>pcd</i> mice. Furthermore, a specific description of nose and tail oscillations in <i>pcd</i> mice were modeled as passive consequences of the forward motion of the hindlimbs. The main conclusions from the study are: a) only by studying whole-body coordination will it be possible to reveal the ataxic locomotor phenotype, and b) the observed locomotor changes are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum provides a forward model for motor control. Although I find the study of great interest there are a number of issues that are problematic for the interpretation of the data. The authors will have to address these issues to avoid making incorrect statements about the findings and the method used."

Walking and trotting patterns have been described for tetrapods to be distinct gaits by many different studies. They are visible at different speeds of locomotion. In your experiments wild-type mice exhibited trot as unique gait used at all speeds, even at the lowest ones when the speed is below 0.2 m/s and the support limbs are three or four (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and 4D</a>). In contrast the <i>pcd</i> mutant mice exhibit only walk, reaching a maximum speed of 0.25 m/s. What is odd about this difference is that walk is clearly found in wild-type mice by all others than these investigators. I believe that it is present even in the present study but that it has been missed (how can you have trot with 3 or 4 limb on the ground?). Since the <i>pcd</i> mice locomote slower than the wild-type mice the change in coordination could simply be caused by a change in gait patterns that is speed dependent. It is known for many animal models (mouse as well) that the inter-limb and whole body coordination change when the animal uses different gaits. At the mechanical level different models have been used to explain the different body coordination of walking and trotting gaits (Mechanical work in terrestrial locomotion: two basic mechanisms for minimizing energy expenditure, Cavagna et al., 1977, American Journal of Physiology). Thus, most of the differences you describe between wild-type and mutant mice could be due just to the comparison of mice using two different gaits that clearly rely on different inter-limb and whole body coordination (e.g. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, 4C, 6A and 6B</a>). Indeed you have clear indications that walk is also expressed in wild-type mice at low speed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and 4C</a>). The data should be reanalyzed to address this issue. I am convinced that if the data are reanalysed, walk will show up in wild-type mice as well. This will dramatically change the conclusion of the story."

The general statement that the automated analysis described in the study provides a robust way for locomotor analysis avoiding \"false positive findings that permeate the mouse locomotor literature\" is not true and likely to offend the locomotor field at large. I strongly recommend that the authors consider gaits (walk, trot, gallop and bound) in their analysis. Since you have done an incredible work using size-matched controls, it will be helpful if the difference between wild-type and <i>pcd</i> mutant mice account just for the degeneration of the Purkinje cells and not for errors due to a comparison between mice using two different gaits."

Changes in vertical paw trajectory and joint angles are hardly 'non-traditional', 'complex', or even '3D' and all measures are definitely 'individual-limb'.

Yet these analyses really aren't done here. They show that joint angles are apparently different in the animals, but these are for single joints as opposed to joint angle relationships (and what those angles are is unclear, see below). I don't think that the results shown here rule out a possible deficit in traditional, within-limb coordination. I think this is mainly an issue of presentation, however, rather than one of substance.

First, although the results are consistent with a role of the cerebellum in predictive control based on forward models, they're not really a direct demonstration thereof. A more direct demonstration might involve examining adaptations to perturbations, e.g. adding a weight to the tail and seeing that initially control animals look like mutants but then learn to predict and compensate for this, whereas mutants never do so. Also, could the results simply be interpreted as one of a limited capacity for motor control? e.g. mutants have limited capacity for producing locomotion and expend most of it on x-axis movement of the paw since it's critical for task performance, whereas other aspects of behavior are allowed to vary? I appreciate the authors are careful on this point to say that the results are 'consistent' with this idea, but alternative explanations might be considered more directly."

Finally, as I understand it (and I might have missed it), this analysis was only done for the mutants. It would be very good to have done the same analysis for the control animals and show that the tail/nose movements are inconsistent with passive movement, e.g. it could have been that the movement of the pelvic girdle was different in controls, leading to less tail movement (even though the hindlimbs are in alternation for both controls and mutants)."

First, <i>because of the very small vertical movements of the paws, the movements are only a few pixels high</i> \u2013 the apparent \u201cnoise\u201d in the detection in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> is generally less than 1mm, which corresponds to <i>2.5 pixels</i> even on our high resolution movies. Second, because of the relatively large size of the paws compared to the vertical displacement, <i>most of the apparent discrepancies between manual and automated tracking are within the size of a paw</i> (all black data points in the supplement). Thus this \u201cnoise\u201d is actually largely biological \u2013 the paw position is defined as the center of the paw, and as you can see in the movies, the center of the paws moves vertically even during the \u201cstance\u201d phase. Thus it is difficult/moot to say whether the discrepancies between detection and manual clicking in these cases are from automated errors or human ones. Finally, we refer the reviewer to the movies where you can evaluate the automated tracking performance (again, focusing on the bottom view, which forms the basis for all stride analyses, because of these considerations) first hand."

We were using \u201ctraditional\u201d to refer to stance-based analyses from paw print analyses and popular commercial systems for mouse locomotion such as CatWalk. However, clearly joint measurements and vertical trajectories (both affected in <i>pcd</i>) are traditional measures for ataxia in other species. We have clarified our terminology throughout the text to reflect more accurately our intended meaning, which is that the parameters that are usually reported as evidence for gait ataxia in mice were only different in <i>pcd</i> in ways that had nothing to do with ataxia (because they were associated with changes in body size and walking speed). Specifically, we now refer to the parameters depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> as \u201cbasic stride parameters\u201d rather than \u201ctraditional gait parameters\u201d, because not only was the use of \u201ctraditional\u201d problematic, but there is a critical distinction between the effects of ataxia on strides (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures. 2 and 3</a>) and gait (which also includes the interlimb and whole-body coordination shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4-7</a>, for example).

A more direct demonstration might involve examining adaptations to perturbations, e.g. adding a weight to the tail and seeing that initially control animals look like mutants but then learn to predict and compensate for this, whereas mutants never do so. Also, could the results simply be interpreted as one of a limited capacity for motor control? e.g. mutants have limited capacity for producing locomotion and expend most of it on x-axis movement of the paw since it's critical for task performance, whereas other aspects of behavior are allowed to vary?

However, the physical modeling required us to make multiple assumptions about the biomechanics of the tail, and we wanted to avoid simply tweaking parameters to achieve a model that would fit the data. We therefore decided to ask whether a very simple geometric model with as few assumptions as possible might do just as well. The passive geometrical model had just two assumptions. First, that passive nose and tail movements would result directly from orthogonal coupling to the forward oscillations of the hind paws \u2013 this was the key insight. Second, that these movements would occur time-delayed relative to the hind paw oscillation (and that the time delays would be longest for the mouse\u2019s rump and become progressively smaller for each more distal segment, due to decreasing mass). It is readily apparent from the data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D-F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1H</a>) that the assumption of time-delayed movements only holds true for <i>pcd</i> mice, and not controls. However the correspondence between the passive model predictions and the nose and tail movements of <i>pcd</i> mice was also striking at the level of the waveforms themselves (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5, A, B</a>). We were surprised at how well this simple model fit the <i>pcd</i> data and found the simplicity of this approach to be quite powerful. However given that biomechanics can be counterintuitive we have also implemented a simplified, 3-segment physical model of the tail as a proof of principle.

I'm not sure how the stats behave in this situation, but it's not clear to me how mixed models would be able to partition variance due to random effects (individual subjects) from the fixed effects (mutation) if there were only one animal in each group. It seems that for other comparisons with weight matched controls much larger N's are used, whereas this analysis is limited because of the need to hand mark frames. It might be easiest to simply drop this joint angle analysis \u2013 I don't think its omission would change the impact of the paper. Also, shouldn't it be 'knee, heel, toe\u2019? And here it's stated that the angle of the foot and arm relative to the ground are quantified \u2013 I might have missed it, but I wasn't sure where that was reported in the Results</i>."
