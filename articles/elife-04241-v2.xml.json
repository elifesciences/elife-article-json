We dissect how 21% O<sub>2</sub>, an indicator of surface exposure, reprograms <i>C. elegans</i>' global state, inducing sustained locomotory arousal and altering expression of neuropeptides, metabolic enzymes, and other non-neural genes. The URX O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons drive arousal at 21% O<sub>2</sub> by tonically activating the RMG interneurons. Stimulating RMG is sufficient to switch behavioral state. Ablating the ASH, ADL, or ASK sensory neurons connected to RMG by gap junctions does not disrupt arousal. However, disrupting cation currents in these neurons curtails RMG neurosecretion and arousal. RMG signals high O<sub>2</sub> by peptidergic secretion. Neuropeptide reporters reveal neural circuit state, as neurosecretion stimulates neuropeptide expression. Neural imaging in unrestrained animals shows that URX and RMG encode O<sub>2</sub> concentration rather than behavior, while the activity of downstream interneurons such as AVB and AIY reflect both O<sub>2</sub> levels and the behavior being executed."

We dissect how 21% O<sub>2</sub>, an indicator of surface exposure, reprograms <i>C. elegans</i>' global state, inducing sustained locomotory arousal and altering expression of neuropeptides, metabolic enzymes, and other non-neural genes. The URX O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons drive arousal at 21% O<sub>2</sub> by tonically activating the RMG interneurons. Stimulating RMG is sufficient to switch behavioral state. Ablating the ASH, ADL, or ASK sensory neurons connected to RMG by gap junctions does not disrupt arousal. However, disrupting cation currents in these neurons curtails RMG neurosecretion and arousal. RMG signals high O<sub>2</sub> by peptidergic secretion. Neuropeptide reporters reveal neural circuit state, as neurosecretion stimulates neuropeptide expression. Neural imaging in unrestrained animals shows that URX and RMG encode O<sub>2</sub> concentration rather than behavior, while the activity of downstream interneurons such as AVB and AIY reflect both O<sub>2</sub> levels and the behavior being executed."

The worm lives in rotting fruit, but it avoids the fruit's surface, perhaps because there is an increased risk of it drying out or being eaten by predators. Microbes that grow within the rotting fruit reduce the oxygen level below the 21% oxygen found in the surrounding air, and so one strategy that <i>C. elegans</i> uses to avoid surface exposure is to continuously monitor the oxygen concentration. If the worm senses that the oxygen level is approaching 21%, which suggests it is nearing the surface, it reverses and turns around. If it cannot find a lower-oxygen environment, the worm switches to continuous rapid movement until it locates such an environment, and adapts its body for surface exposure."

Neurons typically communicate with other neurons via specific connections; but neurons can also release signaling molecules, which act like \u2018wireless\u2019 signals and can affect many other cells. Laurent, Soltesz et al. showed that both kinds of signaling are needed to change the worm's behavior, and suggest that the release of signaling molecules may explain the widespread effects of 21% oxygen on the worm."

Understanding how global states are encoded in neural circuits is of interest because they may provide insights into subjective behaviors: for example, fear, aggression, and hunger (<a href=\"#bib40\">LeDoux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Damasio and Carvalho, 2013</a>)."

A switch in global state is thought to involve recruitment of many brain circuits whose individual activities are dynamically assembled to address the circumstances faced by the animal. A powerful entry point to study circuits orchestrating such states has involved identifying small populations of neurons whose activation or inhibition can evoke features of the states. For example, in mouse, optogenetic activation of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus can induce aggressive behavior (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lin et al., 2011</a>), while optogenetic control of basolateral terminals in the amygdala's central nucleus can regulate anxiety-like states (<a href=\"#bib82\">Tye et al., 2011</a>).

Some of these responses share features of global organismic states in mammals, and may provide insights into how the latter are encoded. A complication in understanding how circuits encode global animal states is that the cues evoking them are often complex. For example, a male <i>Drosophila</i> courting a female fly responds to visual, olfactory, and gustatory cues (<a href=\"#bib85\">Villella and Hall, 2008</a>); in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, starvation resets many sensory responses, including gustation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Saeki et al., 2001</a>), olfaction (<a href=\"#bib81\">Tsunozaki et al., 2008</a>), and thermotaxis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hedgecock and Russell, 1975</a>), but how starvation is sensed and communicated to sensory circuits is poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib51\">Milward et al., 2011</a>).

An increase in O<sub>2</sub> from 19% to 21% elicits avoidance behaviors: animals reverse and change their direction of travel (<a href=\"#bib48\">McGrath et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Persson et al., 2009</a>).

The pair of URX neurons is the most important, and is necessary and sufficient to mediate these responses. In these neurons, rising O<sub>2</sub> stimulates an atypical O<sub>2</sub>-binding soluble guanylate cyclase composed of GCY-35 and GCY-36 subunits (<i>gcy</i>, <i>g</i>uanylate <i>cy</i>clase), leading to cGMP channel opening, and activation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheung et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gray et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Zimmer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Busch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Couto et al., 2013</a>). The response of URX neurons (as well as AQR and PQR) to 21% O<sub>2</sub> is tonic, that is, non-adapting, and alters other behaviors besides promoting rapid movement. At 19% O<sub>2</sub>, <i>C. elegans</i> strongly avoids carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), but at 21% O<sub>2</sub> tonic URX signaling suppresses this avoidance (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carrillo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kodama-Namba et al., 2013</a>).

This behavior is consistent with ecological studies of many species showing that animals tend to leave foraging sites when threat levels rise (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lima and Dill, 1990</a>). The O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons also promote aggregation and accumulation where bacterial food is thickest (<a href=\"#bib15\">Coates and de Bono, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gray et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Rogers et al., 2006</a>).

In summary, <i>C. elegans</i> perceives 21% O<sub>2</sub> as a threat, and responds to it via a discrete set of O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons whose tonic activity coordinates an altered global organismic state."

To prevent <i>npr-1</i> animals from aggregating, which induces gene expression changes that would confound our analysis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersen et al., 2014</a>), we grew animals at low density. We carried out three sets of comparisons. To identify genes whose expression is O<sub>2</sub>-modulated we compared the transcriptomes of <i>npr-1</i> animals grown at 21% and 7% O<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

And to identify and exclude genes whose expression is altered by growth at different O<sub>2</sub> levels independently of <i>gcy-35</i>, we compared the transcriptomes of <i>gcy-35</i>; <i>npr-1</i> animals grown at 21% and 7% O<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). We then intersected the three comparisons, using as a cut-off q value of 0.05 (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

Thus, injecting a constant Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> current into ASH neurons is sufficient to restore O<sub>2</sub> modulation to the circuit in <i>ocr-2; npr-1</i> animals.

To test explicitly if current can flow in the reverse direction, from ASH to RMG, we asked if strongly activating ASH using a noxious stimulus evoked a rise in RMG Ca<sup>2+</sup>. As expected, a 10 mM Cu<sup>2+</sup> stimulus resulted in a large, sharp rise in ASH Ca<sup>2+</sup> that was easily detectable using YC3.60 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hilliard et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). By contrast, this stimulus failed to evoke any Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the RMG cell body that could be measured with YC2.60 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These results suggest that the anatomically defined gap junctions may not allow significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> current to flow from the ASH to the RMG cell body under our imaging conditions. How, then, does OCR-2 promote RMG activity? An alternative model is that by tonically/chronically depolarizing ASH and ADL neurons, OCR-2 reduces the current flowing from RMG to ASH and ADL via gap junctions. In <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> mutants, a more negative membrane potential in ASH and ADL leads to more current being shunted from RMG to the nociceptive neurons, reducing RMG activity. To test this hypothesis, we compared O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in URX and RMG in <i>npr-1</i> and <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). Surprisingly, the steady state Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the URX or RMG cell bodies were not significantly affected by the <i>ocr-2</i> mutation. Since the tetanus toxin experiments suggested that rescue of the <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> phenotype by a <i>pASH::ocr-2</i> transgene did not require synaptic transmission, we speculate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects of disrupting <i>ocr-2</i> are local to the gap junctions and not visible at the RMG cell body. Alternatively, ASH and ADL have the potential to leach away some other excitatory factor from RMG via gap junctions, and OCR-2 activity in ASH and ADL can attenuate this."

This limitation prompted us to seek a way to monitor enduring changes in neurosecretion as readouts of different global states. In vertebrates, several studies have reported that increased neural activity is associated with increased neuropeptide gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib83\">Uhl and Nishimori, 1990</a>). In pancreatic \u03b2 cells, feedback mechanisms couple insulin production and release (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borgonovo et al., 2006</a>). If transcription of most neuropeptide genes is coupled to peptide release, <i>promoter::GFP</i> reporters for such genes should provide a readout of peptidergic circuit activity. To test this, we first studied a <i>pflp-11::GFP</i> reporter expressed in the URX, AUA, and SAB neurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kim and Li, 2004</a>).

The genotype at the <i>npr-1</i> locus did not affect <i>pflp-11::gfp</i> expression in URX, but expression in the AUA neurons was reduced in animals encoding the <i>npr-1 215V</i> allele compared to <i>npr-1</i> null mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). <i>pflp-11::gfp</i> expression in SAB, a neuron not known to be modulated by O<sub>2</sub>, was not affected either by O<sub>2</sub> experience or the genotypes tested, providing an internal control.

We have shown that RMG activity is sufficient to drive high locomotory activity, and that ASH, ADL, and ASK are each dispensable for these effects. Does peptidergic signaling from RMG contribute to driving high locomotory activity at high O<sub>2</sub>? We first tested the effects of blocking all neurosecretion from RMG using cell-specific expression of a tetanus toxin transgene in <i>npr-1</i>. To monitor expression, we used a polycistronic construct that co-expressed the toxin with RFP. Animals expressing the transgene lost any tonic response to high O<sub>2</sub> and remained very poorly active at all O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). This was expected from previous work (<a href=\"#bib45\">Macosko et al., 2009</a>), although that study did not explicitly examine O<sub>2</sub>-evoked responses. We next tested more specifically if neuropeptides secreted from RMG were required, using cell-specific RNAi to knock down the carboxypeptidase E (CPE) <i>egl-21</i> in RMG. Carboxypeptidase E removes C-terminal lysine and arginine residues from pro-peptides during maturation, and analysis of peptide extracts from <i>egl-21</i> mutants shows a deficit in the maturation of most <i>C. elegans</i> neuropeptides (<a href=\"#bib33\">Husson et al., 2007</a>). <i>npr-1</i> animals with selective RNAi knockdown of <i>egl-21</i> in RMG moved appropriately slowly in 7% O<sub>2</sub>, but sped up much less than non-transgenic siblings when switched to 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and reversed more frequently (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging approaches, although powerful, are blind to signaling mechanisms that alter synaptic and neurosecretory activity without affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We were inspired by sporadic reports suggesting a positive correlation between neural activity and neuropeptide gene transcription in the mammalian brain. By studying multiple neuropeptide genes expressed in URX, RMG, and other neurons, we showed that transcription of these genes is positively coupled to the secretory activity of the neurons expressing them. The feedback loop appears to act downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and to be linked to neurosecretion itself, since it can be disrupted by expressing tetanus toxin, which inhibits synaptic release by cleaving synaptobrevin. The effects of tetanus toxin on neuropeptide expression recapitulate the effects of manipulating circuit activity by disrupting signaling molecules or by altering O<sub>2</sub> levels. If our observations are generalizable, neuropeptide transcriptional reporters provide a way to dissect tonic modulation of secretory activity in neural networks."

Restoring <i>ocr-2</i> to any one of the ASH, ADL, or ADF neurons restores O<sub>2</sub> modulation of locomotion to <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> animals. Injecting current in ASH neurons using channelrhodopsin also restores strong modulation of locomotion by O<sub>2</sub> to <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> mutants, consistent with <i>ocr-2</i> mutations chronically reducing ASH activity. The neuroanatomy suggests that ASH and ADL are gap-junctionally connected to RMG. Although a rise in O<sub>2</sub> evokes an increase in ASH Ca<sup>2+</sup>, several findings argue against a simple \u2018hub-to-spoke\u2019 model in which ASH and ADL spokes are necessary to relay RMG hub activity outwards to evoke behavioral responses. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in ASH upon switch to 21% O<sub>2</sub> is very small. Ablating ASH and ADL, or expressing tetanus toxin in these neurons, does not disrupt the O<sub>2</sub> regulation of locomotion. Moreover, selective expression of <i>ocr-2</i> in ADF neurons, which are not gap-junctionally connected to RMG, can partially rescue the <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> phenotype. Nevertheless, OCR-2 currents in ASH or ADL can influence the O<sub>2</sub>-evoked changes in locomotion. How? One model is that tonic/chronic OCR-2 channel activity in ASH and ADL keeps these neurons depolarized and limits the current shunted locally from RMG to these neurons. Several observations support this possibility. First, expression of neuropeptide reporters in RMG is downregulated in <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> animals to levels found in <i>npr-1</i> animals kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub>. This suggests that loss of TRPV activity reduces neurosecretion from RMG. Second, the ability of <i>ocr-2</i> expression in ASH or ADL neurons to rescue the <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> phenotype does not require neurotransmission, suggesting gap junctions are involved. Third, injecting current into ASH can restore to <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> animals the O<sub>2</sub> regulated switch in high locomotory activity. Fourth, injecting current directly into RMG using channelrhodopsin can also rescue the <i>ocr-2</i>; <i>npr-1</i> phenotype, indicating that increasing RMG Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to bypass the lack of OCR-2-dependent activity. Unexpectedly, deleting <i>ocr-2</i> did not affect the steady state O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the RMG cell body, suggesting that any effects on RMG Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are local. The simplest model that explains our data is that OCR-2 signaling in ASH and ADL prevents shunting of current, or loss of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent second messenger, from RMG to ASH and ADL through gap junctions. Membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are not necessarily coupled, and a local current leak through gap junctions can be functionally important without necessarily altering Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the soma."

In that circuit, OLQ and CEP mechanoreceptors that are coupled by gap junctions to each other and to the RIH hub interneuron act as coincidence detectors, pooling information through RIH, which in turn enables the high threshold FLP mechanoreceptors, also connected to RIH via gap junctions, to evoke a response to a gentle nose touch. In the RMG circuit, reducing RMG neurosecretory output by cell-selective expression of tetanus toxin or RNAi knockdown of the carboxypeptidase E <i>egl-21</i> strongly reduces transmission of the high O<sub>2</sub> information, suggesting that peptidergic release from RMG is a major output of the URX and RMG couple."

Moreover, the activity level of RMG controls behavioral state rather than directly commanding a specific action: RMG activity remains high at 21% O<sub>2</sub> regardless of the animal's speed or direction of travel. By contrast, the second and third layers of interneurons modulated by O<sub>2</sub> appear to be directly involved in generating specific behaviors.

We generated independent libraries of biological replicates as follows: <i>npr-1</i>, four libraries for 21% O<sub>2</sub> and six for 7% O<sub>2</sub>; <i>gcy-35</i>; <i>npr-1</i>, seven libraries for 21% O<sub>2</sub> and seven for 7% O<sub>2</sub>. Approximately 30 million 50 bp single-end reads were produced for each sample."

A small portion (3\u20134%) of reads containing over-represented sequences (e.g., Illumina adapters) identified by FastQC were removed with Trimmomatic v0.30 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bolger et al., 2014</a>). The remaining reads were aligned to the <i>C. elegans</i> genome (WBcel235) with TopHat v2.0.13 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). TopHat was run using default parameters with the following exceptions: coverage search was disabled using --no-coverage-search; library-type was changed to fr-firststrand; and the WBcel235 transcriptome annotations were provided via --transcriptome-index. In addition, since <i>C. elegans</i> has comparatively short introns (<a href=\"#bib72\">Steijger et al., 2013</a>), --min-intron-length and --min-segment-intron were both reduced to 30. The aligned reads were then processed using the Cufflinks suite v2.2.1 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Trapnell et al., 2012</a>) to assemble transcripts and ultimately compute differential gene expression between conditions. Transcripts were assembled for each sample with the Cufflinks tool (<a href=\"#bib76\">Trapnell et al., 2010</a>), again lowering --min-intron-length, as well as --overlap-radius, to 30. The sample transcript assemblies were then merged with reference annotations (WBcel235) using Cuffmerge to generate a single, overall transcript assembly. The Cuffquant tool, using this merged assembly, was then used to compute gene and transcript abundances for each sample. Finally, sample abundances were integrated with the merged assembly by Cuffdiff (<a href=\"#bib78\">Trapnell et al., 2013</a>) to test for differential expression between all condition pairs. All the Cufflinks tools, aside from Cuffmerge, were used with the --library-type parameter again set to fr-firststrand and both --frag-bias-correct (<a href=\"#bib63\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>) and --multi-read-correct enabled.

To detect reversals, sharp (greater than 60\u00b0) changes in direction were first identified. Each potential behavior pattern that could be assigned to each track was then examined using a heuristic algorithm based on penalizing any occurrences of continuous movements lasting for more than 7.5 s in the same direction that do not correspond to forward movements, any time an omega-turn is not followed by forward movement, and cases where a worm does not spend more time in forward than in backward movement.

Where this was not a viable option due to the complexity of the expression pattern, we used a semi-supervised heuristic tracking approach in which in each frame the area within a 20-by-20 pixel square centered around the location of the centroid of the region of interest (ROI) in the previous frame was examined for potential matches. Regions whose intensity differed by less than 1/3 from that of the ROI identified in the previous frame, and whose centroids were located within a 10-pixel radius of the ROI location in the previous frame, were identified as candidates for the ROI in the current frame. If no such candidates were detected, user input was requested in identifying the ROI in the current frame. If exactly one such candidate was detected, it was identified as the ROI in the current frame. If more than one such candidate was detected, match quality scores were calculated for each candidate based on their differences in intensity and centroid location from the ROI in the previous frame. If one candidate had a better quality score in both respects than all others, it was identified as the ROI in the current frame; user input was otherwise requested.
