The mechanisms that regulate the number of sensory progenitors are not known. Here, we show that Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) 9 and 20, which are expressed in the non-sensory (<i>Fgf9</i>) and sensory (<i>Fgf20</i>) epithelium during otic development, regulate the number of cochlear progenitors. We further demonstrate that <i>Fgf receptor</i> (<i>Fgfr</i>) <i>1</i> signaling within the developing sensory epithelium is required for the differentiation of outer hair cells and SCs, while mesenchymal FGFRs regulate the size of the sensory progenitor population and the overall cochlear length. In addition, ectopic FGFR activation in mesenchyme was sufficient to increase sensory progenitor proliferation and cochlear length. These data define a feedback mechanism, originating from epithelial FGF ligands and mediated through periotic mesenchyme that controls the number of sensory progenitors and the length of the cochlea."

The mechanisms that regulate the number of sensory progenitors are not known. Here, we show that Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) 9 and 20, which are expressed in the non-sensory (<i>Fgf9</i>) and sensory (<i>Fgf20</i>) epithelium during otic development, regulate the number of cochlear progenitors. We further demonstrate that <i>Fgf receptor</i> (<i>Fgfr</i>) <i>1</i> signaling within the developing sensory epithelium is required for the differentiation of outer hair cells and SCs, while mesenchymal FGFRs regulate the size of the sensory progenitor population and the overall cochlear length. In addition, ectopic FGFR activation in mesenchyme was sufficient to increase sensory progenitor proliferation and cochlear length. These data define a feedback mechanism, originating from epithelial FGF ligands and mediated through periotic mesenchyme that controls the number of sensory progenitors and the length of the cochlea."

The frequency spectrum of sound stimuli is tonotopically represented along the length of the mammalian cochlea (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fay and Popper, 2000</a>). In mouse, the cochlea begins to grow from the ventral otic vesicle at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) and continues to grow and coil, forming approximately one and a half turns by birth. During its development, the length of the cochlea is limited by the number of progenitors that give rise to sensory HCs and SCs, and is further regulated through a process of convergent extension (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen and Segil, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wu and Kelley, 2012</a>). In mouse, sensory progenitors exit the cell cycle by E14.5 and begin to differentiate into HCs and SCs. Thus, the size of the progenitor population at this stage of development is the ultimate determinant of the size of the adult cochlea. Progenitor number is determined by proliferation, the timing of differentiation, and in some cases by aberrant cell death. Previous studies indicate that sensory progenitor growth requires mesenchymal signals (<a href=\"#bib35\">Phippard et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Montcouquiol and Kelley, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Braunstein et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2009</a><a href=\"#bib5\">), however, the identity and source of the factors that control this activity are not known.</a>"

Phenotypic similarities with mice lacking <i>Fgfr1</i> in the entire otic epithelium suggest that FGF20 signals directly to FGFR1, serving as a permissive factor for differentiation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pirvola et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hayashi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Huh et al., 2012</a>).

We find that in vivo FGF9/20 signaling to mesenchymal FGFR1 and FGFR2 is required for sensory progenitor proliferation and that mesenchymal FGFR signaling is sufficient to promote sensory progenitor proliferation and extend the length of the cochlear duct. In addition, we show that prosensory epithelial FGFR1 and FGF20 independently is required for differentiation of outer HCs and SCs."

In mice, sensory progenitors exit from the cell cycle beginning at the apical end of the cochlea at \u223cE12.5 and ending at the base at \u223cE14.5. In contrast, differentiation begins in the mid-base at \u223cE14.5 and then extends to the base and apex (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wu and Kelley, 2012</a>). Under physiological conditions, once progenitors exit the cell cycle, they do not reenter the cell cycle throughout the life of the organism. Previous studies suggested that during development both epithelial and mesenchymal signals are required to regulate cochlear progenitor proliferation and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Montcouquiol and Kelley, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Doetzlhofer et al., 2004</a>). However, the mechanisms that control cochlear sensory progenitor proliferation are not known. In this study, we found that epithelial FGF9 and FGF20 signaling to mesenchymal FGFR1 and FGFR2 is required for normal levels of cochlear sensory progenitor proliferation and that inactivation of either the ligands or the mesenchymal receptors results in a shortened cochlea. We also demonstrated that activation of mesenchymal FGFR signaling is sufficient to increase sensory progenitor proliferation and extend cochlear length."

Deletion of <i>Tbx1</i> in mesenchymal cells resulted in defects in cochlear epithelial proliferation indicating a non-cell autonomous requirement for Tbx1 for cochlear epithelial development (<a href=\"#bib49\">Xu et al., 2007</a>). In addition, the Pou domain containing transcription factor, Pou3f4, also known as Brn4, is expressed in mesenchymal cells in the developing inner ear (<a href=\"#bib35\">Phippard et al., 1999</a>). Deletion of <i>Pou3f4</i> resulted in reduction of cochlear length and defects in derivatives of the otic mesenchyme including the spiral limbus, scala tympani, and strial fibrocytes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Phippard et al., 1999</a>). Furthermore, decreasing gene dosages of <i>Tbx1</i> and <i>Pou3f4</i> resulted in a significant decrease in sensory epithelial proliferation and cochlear length indicating that Tbx1 and Pou3f4 genetically interact. The RA catabolizing genes <i>Cyp26a1</i> and <i>Cyp26c1</i>, both targets of Tbx1 and Pou3f4, were decreased in these mice, suggesting that increased RA signaling could directly or indirectly suppress sensory progenitor proliferation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Braunstein et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2009</a><a href=\"#bib5\">). Analysis of <i>Fgf9</i> and <i>Fgf20</i> double mutant mice showed no change in the expression of Tbx1 and Pou3f4 in mesenchyme surrounding the otic vesicle, suggesting that mesenchymal FGF signaling does not directly affect transcription factors that regulate RA signaling (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). On the other hand, <i>Etv4</i> and <i>Etv5</i> function as downstream targets of FGF signaling in other systems including the limb (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>), and <i>Etv4</i> and <i>Etv5</i> expression were decreased in <i>Fgf9</i>/<i>Fgf20</i> mutant ears. Future studies will be needed to determine whether FGF signaling including ETV4 and ETV5 regulates RA signaling downstream of Tbx1/Pou3f4 or act in parallel to the Tbx1/Pou3f4/RA signaling pathway to regulate sensory progenitor proliferation. Whether the cellular target of RA signaling is in the periotic mesenchyme or the sensory progenitor epithelium also remains to be determined. It is also possible that the number of nearby mesenchymal cells may influence sensory progenitor proliferation. However, considering that loss of <i>Fgf9</i> resulted in decreased mesenchymal cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pirvola et al., 2004</a>) but did not affect HC formation or cochlear length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), alternative mechanisms may need to be considered.</a>"

Recent publications showed that inhibition of Notch signaling could induce transdifferentiation of SCs to HCs in a damaged cochlea (<a href=\"#bib23\">Korrapati et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mizutari et al., 2013</a>). In addition, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling can induce SC proliferation in neonatal mice (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chai et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Shi et al., 2012</a>). One intermediate goal of regenerative biology for the inner ear would be to generate large numbers of sensory progenitor cells that could be differentiated into functional HCs and SCs and then be reintroduced into the damaged inner ear. The studies presented here suggest that in efforts to grow inner ear sensory progenitor cells in vitro, that FGF-induced mesenchyme may be necessary. The identification of mesenchymal factors that are regulated by FGF or RA could also be used to support the growth of sensory progenitor cells."

As a minimum, this should include a full characterisation of the mesenchymal phenotype in each of the mutants, including the <i>Fgf9</i> and <i>Fgf20</i> single mutants for comparison. Improved quantitation of the sensory cell phenotype and levels of proliferation in epithelium and mesenchyme, ideally including a marker other than PHH3, will be important. Alternative interpretations of the mesenchymal phenotype should be considered and discussed. A fuller discussion of the phenotype caused by <i>Fgfr1</i> KO in the epithelium is also required, since this also affects cochlear length. The revised version must include citation, acknowledgement and discussion of previously published work that impacts on the current study. In particular, it will be worth examining the IHC phenotype carefully here."

The new information here is that FGF signalling from epithelium to mesenchyme is both required and sufficient for sensory progenitor proliferation and extension of the cochlear duct. The data are clear and support the conclusions well. However, there is no identification of a potential mechanism for the mesenchymal signal back to the cochlear duct that regulates its growth. As a result, the advance that the study makes over previous work appears to be somewhat incremental."

My interpretation of the Results was that <i>Fgf20</i> primarily signals through <i>Fgfr1</i> in the cochlear epithelium to regulate patterning of lateral compartment of the organ of Corti, while <i>Fgf9</i> primarily signals through <i>Fgfr2</i> in the mesenchyme to regulate cochlear length, with some cross-activity and redundancy between the two FGF pathways. However, the Discussion merely focusses on the redundancy rather than any differences between the two. It would be interesting to relate any differences to the clear differences between the non-overlapping expression domains of each FGF in the developing cochlear duct, and to the expression domains of the FGFRs, which are not shown (see comment above)."

One possibility is that the effect on cochlear length is secondary, not because of a direct action of <i>Fgf9/20</i> on <i>Fgfr1</i> and <i>2</i> in the mesenchyme, but because there is simply less mesenchyme. I think that it is quite likely that a reduction of <i>Fgfr1</i> and <i>2</i> in the peri-otic mesenchyme at such early stages leads to a reduction in the amount of mesenchyme. As Doetzlhofer et al., had shown, the mesenchyme is important for outgrowth. The authors need to analyse the periotic mesenchyme in these mutants."

This role for <i>Fgf20</i> has been previously described by this group, and here they extend that work to show that <i>Fgf9</i> does not play a role in this aspect. In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, the paper suffers from not showing data from <i>Fgf20</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice alone (presumably because this is contained in their earlier publication). I think evidence from this mouse should be included here as part of the current analysis, so that direct comparison is possible; also, its absence makes the description of the various phenotypes rather confusing, and the authors might want to spend some time thinking of a way to describe this part more clearly. In the end of this first section, the authors claim that there are synergistic effects between the two genes; but I am unclear about why they are making this interpretation, since the lack of any patterning defects in <i>Fgf9</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup>, seems to suggest that this FGF acts outside the prosensory domain to affect the length of the cochlear duct (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

This is an interesting observation, but seems to contradict the separate roles that the two genes play as described in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, namely prosensory (<i>Fgf20</i>) and non-prosensory (<i>Fgf9</i>). The data here are also a little difficult. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G and H</a>, they are counting cells in histological sections rather than whole mounts? But it is difficult to know how much of the prosensory domain they actually measure, and did they count in exactly the same basal-apical position? This may have been difficult to do, since the (<i>Fgf20</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup><i>::Fgf9</i><sup><i>-/+</i></sup>) does show a change in patterning (\u201cless compact\u201d). Thus, the modest counting difference that they observe in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G and H</a> could be due to differences in cell distribution within the duct? Indeed, from this figure there does seem to be a trend in their data showing that <i>Fgf20</i> has an effect on its own, without <i>Fgf9</i>, even if their statistical test does not show a significant difference; and so <i>Fgf9</i> could be skewing the data by changing the shape of the duct? This leads me to be skeptical of their interpretation that the genes are acting together, instead of independently on two different elements of the observed phenotype."

We have analyzed periotic mesenchyme for candidate signaling molecules and targets of FGFR signaling.

Many PCP mutants that have disrupted convergent extension show decreased cochlear length. We posit that <i>Fgf9/20</i> signaling to mesenchyme is required for progenitor proliferation, thus affecting cochlear length.

From these data we conclude that FGF20 alone does not affect progenitor cell number, but rather functions later in development to regulate epithelial patterning (differentiation).
