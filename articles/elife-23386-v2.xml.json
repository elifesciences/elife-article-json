The neural pathways by which taste compounds influence innate and learned behaviors have not been resolved. Here, we identify three classes of taste projection neurons (TPNs) in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> distinguished by their morphology and taste selectivity. TPNs receive input from gustatory receptor neurons and respond selectively to sweet or bitter stimuli, demonstrating segregated processing of different taste modalities. Activation of TPNs influences innate feeding behavior, whereas inhibition has little effect, suggesting parallel pathways. Moreover, two TPN classes are absolutely required for conditioned taste aversion, a learned behavior. The TPNs essential for conditioned aversion project to the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP) and convey taste information to mushroom body learning centers. These studies identify taste pathways from sensory detection to higher brain that influence innate behavior and are essential for learned responses to taste compounds."

The neural pathways by which taste compounds influence innate and learned behaviors have not been resolved. Here, we identify three classes of taste projection neurons (TPNs) in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> distinguished by their morphology and taste selectivity. TPNs receive input from gustatory receptor neurons and respond selectively to sweet or bitter stimuli, demonstrating segregated processing of different taste modalities. Activation of TPNs influences innate feeding behavior, whereas inhibition has little effect, suggesting parallel pathways. Moreover, two TPN classes are absolutely required for conditioned taste aversion, a learned behavior. The TPNs essential for conditioned aversion project to the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP) and convey taste information to mushroom body learning centers. These studies identify taste pathways from sensory detection to higher brain that influence innate behavior and are essential for learned responses to taste compounds."

Fly gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) are located on the proboscis labellum, internal mouthparts, legs, and wings (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stocker, 1994</a>). Different GRNs detect different taste modalities, including, sugar, bitter, water, and pheromones (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cameron et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Thorne et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Toda et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2004</a>). Most sensory neurons on the legs and wings send axons to the ventral nerve cord (VNC), whereas those on the proboscis labellum and mouthparts project to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the central brain (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stocker, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2004</a>). Activation of sucrose-responsive taste neurons triggers behavioral subprograms associated with feeding, including inhibition of locomotion, extension of the fly proboscis, and ingestion (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gordon and Scott, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Keene and Masek, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Marella et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thoma et al., 2016</a>).

A different study identified local SEZ interneurons as candidate second-order neurons that sense sugar detection specifically of mouthpart sensory neurons. Inhibiting activity in these neurons selectively inhibited ingestion, and activating them prolonged ingestion without influencing proboscis extension (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yapici et al., 2016</a>). The candidate second-order neurons identified to date show remarkable specificity in terms of the sensory neurons that activate them (proboscis versus mouthparts) and the behavioral subprograms they generate (proboscis extension versus ingestion). The model suggested by these findings is that taste information is processed by parallel labeled lines via several different neural streams that coordinate different aspects of feeding behavior. Consistent with this, a behavioral study of the function of different taste neurons on the legs found that some caused inhibition of locomotion whereas others promoted proboscis extension (<a href=\"#bib59\">Thoma et al., 2016</a>)."

Here, we identify three classes of taste projection neurons (TPNs), distinguished by their morphology and taste selectivity, that reveal the existence of taste processing streams that are especially important for learned associations. Our studies demonstrate the existence of modality-selective taste pathways to higher brain, highlight similarities in the organization of second-order sensory neurons, and characterize taste processing streams required for learned taste aversion."

TPN2 contains two pairs of bilaterally symmetric cells, labeled by <i>VT57358-Gal4</i>. One pair has cell bodies on the dorsal surface of the metathoracic neuromere with contralateral VNC dendrites and the second pair has cell bodies in the abdominal ganglion with bilateral VNC dendrites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Otherwise, the two pairs have similar axonal projections in the SEZ and lateral protocerebrum (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). TPN3 has one pair of cell bodies in the cervical connective, bilateral dendrites in the SEZ, and bilateral axonal termini in the lateral protocerebrum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>).

Two of the most studied structures in <i>Drosophila</i> higher brain include the mushroom bodies (MB) and lateral horn (LH), regions where second-order olfactory projection neurons terminate (<a href=\"#bib48\">Marin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wong et al., 2002</a>). The MBs are essential for learned olfactory associations, whereas the LH has been implicated in innate olfactory behaviors (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Heimbeck et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kido and Ito, 2002</a>). We used double-labeling experiments to assess the relationship between the TPNs, MBs, LH, and olfactory projection neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Both TPN2 and TPN3 axons run parallel to the olfactory projection neuron lateral antennal lobe tract (lALT) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,I</a>).

TPN3 also has axons terminating anterior to the LH, along the medial edge of the LH (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Thus, TPN2 and TPN3 project near olfactory projection neurons, following along the lALT, with some terminal fibers in the LH but most in the SLP. The SLP is a convergence zone that provides inputs and outputs to the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom bodies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aso et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ito et al., 1998</a>).

To examine whether TPN activation might influence this innate behavior, we selectively activated TPNs with the red-light-gated cation channel CsChrimson (<a href=\"#bib36\">Klapoetke et al., 2014</a>) and examined the effects on PER. In the absence of a taste stimulus, activation of either TPN1 or TPN2 increased PER, whereas activation of TPN3 did not elicit PER (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To test whether activation of TPNs modulates PER in the presence of a moderately appetitive gustatory stimulus, we presented flies with sucrose on their legs while activating TPNs. Activation of TPN1 or TPN2 did not significantly increase PER in this context. However, simultaneous activation of TPN3 with sucrose presentation significantly decreased PER (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As activation of sugar-sensing TPN1 and TPN2 promotes PER whereas activation of bitter-sensing TPN3 inhibits PER, these experiments demonstrate that neurons that project to the SEZ (TPN1 and TPN2) as well as those that project to protocerebrum (TPN2 and TPN3) can influence SEZ sensorimotor circuits involved in proboscis extension."

As another strategy to ask whether TPN2 could act upstream of MB circuits, we asked whether TPN2 influenced activity in aminergic inputs into MBs. Recent studies revealed that activity in dopaminergic MB inputs, including PPL1, is oppositely regulated by appetitive and aversive stimuli (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cohn et al., 2015</a>). We therefore monitored activity in PPL1 neurons while activating TPN2 with CsChrimson and found that TPN2 activation significantly decreased PPL1 calcium levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The TPN2-dependent changes in PPL1 activity does not readily fit mushroom body learning models is which sugar is the CS signal, and further investigation is required to determine the relevance for conditioned taste behavior. Nevertheless, these findings demonstrate that PPL1 activity is oppositely regulated by TPN2 and TPN3 and argue that both TPN2 and TPN3 may act upstream of the mushroom bodies."

We generated flies in which bitter GRNs express CsChrimson, allowing for exogenous activation with red light, and monitored calcium signals in both TPN3 and PPL1-MV1 neurons (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). A red indicator was also expressed, allowing for the visualization and laser-ablation of TPN3 axons along the lALT tract.

Although the molecular and functional identity of taste receptor neurons in the periphery has been established, the pathways that process gustatory information in higher brain have not been elucidated. Here, we identify three novel classes of taste projection neurons in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> that convey taste detection from the periphery to higher brain centers. Two classes are sugar-responsive and their activation promotes PER, an innate feeding behavior, whereas one class is bitter-responsive and its activation inhibits PER. Conditional silencing of taste projection neurons has little effect on PER, suggesting parallel pathways, but dramatically influences a learned behavior, conditioned taste aversion. The neurons essential for conditioned taste aversion terminate in the superior lateral protocerebrum and act upstream of mushroom body learning centers. These studies demonstrate modality-selective taste pathways to higher brain, show that taste pathways to the SLP are required for learned associations but not for innate proboscis extension, and suggest similarities in the routing of sensory information in the fly brain."

Recent studies in <i>Drosophila</i> have identified interneurons as well as motor neurons that respond selectively to sugars (<a href=\"#bib18\">Flood et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gordon and Scott, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kain and Dahanukar, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yapici et al., 2016</a>). Our work extends these studies by identifying long-range projection neurons that separately carry sweet or bitter information to higher brain, demonstrating modality-specific relays. Moreover, TPN1 and TPN2 selectively relay sugar taste detection from the legs, with unilateral or bilateral leg sensory inputs and unilateral axonal projections. This organotopy suggests that taste detection from different organs serves different functions, consistent with studies identifying interneurons that sense sweet taste from the mouthparts and drive ingestion (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yapici et al., 2016</a>). In addition, the lateralized sugar projections that we identified may allow sugar detection to be finely localized to the left or right legs, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</a>). In contrast, TPN3 responds to bitter taste on the legs and the proboscis, suggesting that aversion to bitter compounds may not require pinpointing location. The organ-specific and modality-specific connectivity of TPNs demonstrates a mechanism to encode taste location in addition to taste quality."

Inhibiting synaptic transmission in sugar-sensing TPN2 during either training or testing decreased conditioned aversion, whereas inhibiting bitter TPN3 decreased aversion only if inhibition occurred during training. These behavioral results are most consistent with the notion that TPN2 carries the CS signal and TPN3 encodes the bitter US. The notion that TPN3 carries the bitter US is further supported by behavioral experiments showing that TPN3 activation is sufficient to replace bitter as the US and by calcium imaging experiments showing that TPN3 activates the PPL1 US punishment neurons that wrap around MB lobes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>). Our observation that bitter sensory neurons activate PPL1 when TPN3 is ablated argues that there are additional bitter pathways that lead to PPL1 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). The requirement of TPN3 for conditioned taste aversion but not for PPL1 bitter activation is difficult to reconcile without greater understanding of the underlying pathways for the behavior."

Innate responses to sugar are unimpaired upon TPN2 silencing, whereas conditioned responses are impacted. If TPN2 conveys the sugar CS signal, we would predict that TPN2 transmits information to Kenyon cell dendrites similar to olfactory CS, but we were unable to observe this. Nevertheless, our calcium-imaging data show that TPN2 negatively regulates PPL1 activity, arguing that TPN2 can provide an input into MB circuits, although the significance for conditioned taste aversion behavior is not clear. An additional possibility is that TPN2 might provide a copy of sugar acceptance to the SLP that is then modified downstream of MB learning circuits. Although our studies clearly show that TPNs influence activity in MB inputs, they do not exclude the possibility that TPNs also send signals to additional neurons that act upstream or downstream of MB circuits."

We find that taste projection neurons run parallel to the lateral antennal lobe tract (lALT) similar to a subset of thermosensory and olfactory projection neurons and terminate in the SLP with a few fibers in the lateral horn.

For leg stimulation experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), the proboscis was removed and all legs remained intact.

For lateral protocerebrum imaging (TPN3), the proboscis was waxed out, the antennae were removed, and the dorsal cuticle and underlying air sacs were removed. For proboscis stimulation experiments, the legs were removed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). For all leg stimulation, approximately 10 uL of solution was suspended around a cube of 2% agarose and secured on a micromanipulator. The tastant was manually advanced to allow all six freely moving legs to contact the tastant. The approximate time of stimulation was noted for all experiments. Variability in latency likely arises from the manual presentation and the volitional movement of the fly. For proboscis stimulation, tastants were presented to the proboscis via capillary tube (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</a>). dTRPA1 stimulation during imaging was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</a>).

First, we tested the effect of activating the TPNs in the absence of a tastant. Flies were exposed to 5 s of red light for two trials. Flies were considered to have no extension if the proboscis did not move for both trials, full extension if a full PER was observed in either trial, and a partial extension if the proboscis partially extended for at least one trial. We used a 2 \u00d7 3 Fisher\u2019s Exact Test to whether the proportions of flies responding to red light was statistically different. Second, we simultaneously activated the TPNs while presenting 100 mM sucrose on the tarsi of the flies. This moderately appetitive stimulus results in proboscis extension 50% of the time in control flies (e.g. gray bars in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Flies were water-satiated before the experiment and in between trials, and presented with the tastant and red light for up to five seconds (or until a PER was observed). Flies were given a score of 0 for no extension, 0.5 for partial extension, and one for full extension, and the average was taken across two trials. We used 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum tests since comparisons were made between flies with and without retinal exposure.

In fruit flies, work in the olfactory, visual and gustatory pathways have provided a wealth of insights into how the sensory periphery extracts salient cues, and have exploited largely reflexive behaviors to unravel how this information can guide behavior. However, in the gustatory system, our understanding has been centrally limited by the fact that while genetic tools to characterize primary sensory neurons and output motor neurons have been spectacularly successful, efforts to go deeper into the circuit have met limited success."

By screening a number of Gal4 collections, they establish genetic access to these neurons, show that they have dendrites in close proximity to primary taste receptors, and use calcium imaging to show that these cells are taste responsive. They then use genetic tools to activate or silence synaptic transmission from these cells, and discover that while they are not required for innate, reflexive responses to bitter and sweet compounds, they do play critical roles in learned preferences."

I am therefore supportive of publication, and have only one point that I would like the authors to respond to, likely in the text of the manuscript. In particular, I am puzzled by the variable, often extended, response latencies of the TPNs. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, the authors show stimulus evoked \u2013 calcium traces that sometimes only begin to rise above baseline after a period of 1-2 seconds, but can also be \"immediate\" (compare 3D top sucrose trace with the bottom trace). Conversely, thermal activation of the input neurons invariably produces immediate responses (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), a result more in line with my expectation of the response of a second order neuron. While I could imagine that the time traces of sensory stimulation as marked in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> might be somewhat less precise than those of thermal activation, could they really be off by something like two seconds, making this a trivial technical issue? Or is it possible that there is something else of interest here, such as the possibility that processing of natural stimuli might be gated in time depending on the specifics of the trial structure (that is, whether the animal was previously exposed to water or bitter)? Or something else?"

The projection neurons were found in the expression patterns of enhancer fusion Gal4 lines, two of which (i.e. the ones for TPN1 and TPN2) are exquisitely selective, strongly expressing Gal4 only in the TPNs. The third class of projection neuron (TPN3) was identified as a pair of neurons common to two lines that otherwise overlapped little. The authors used these Gal4 lines to characterize the anatomy, projections, gustatory selectivity, functions, and functional connectivity of the three classes of TPNs. The analysis is elegantly presented, the data is compelling, and the conclusions are for the most part novel and of high interest. In particular, the finding that the TPN2 and TPN3 projection neurons are required for the learning and contextualization of gustatory information in a conditioned taste aversion paradigm is of great interest and not only sheds light on how gustatory experience is processed to influence future behavior, but also begins to reveal similarities in the processing streams of different sensory modalities."

I am therefore supportive of publication, and have only one point that I would like the authors to respond to, likely in the text of the manuscript. In particular, I am puzzled by the variable, often extended, response latencies of the TPNs. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, the authors show stimulus evoked \u2013 calcium traces that sometimes only begin to rise above baseline after a period of 1-2 seconds, but can also be \"immediate\" (compare 3D top sucrose trace with the bottom trace). Conversely, thermal activation of the input neurons invariably produces immediate responses (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), a result more in line with my expectation of the response of a second order neuron. While I could imagine that the time traces of sensory stimulation as marked in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> might be somewhat less precise than those of thermal activation, could they really be off by something like two seconds, making this a trivial technical issue? Or is it possible that there is something else of interest here, such as the possibility that processing of natural stimuli might be gated in time depending on the specifics of the trial structure (that is, whether the animal was previously exposed to water or bitter)? Or something else?</i> "

In tarsal (leg) stimulation protocols, the fly\u2019s legs remain free to move and we use a micro-manipulator to manually advance the stimulus while visualizing the stimulus with a USB pen camera. Therefore, tastant presentation time therefore has two major sources of variability: first, the manual nature of our stimulus presentation adds some variability (but only on the order of 100s of ms); second, the fly\u2019s volitional movement adds substantial variability (a fly that happens to be \u201creaching\u201d can touch the stimulus much sooner than a fly whose legs are more retracted, certainly adding variability on the scale of 1-2 s). Neither sources of variability are present with the thermal activation (which is initiated with a TTL pulse).
