                    "text": "Dravet Syndrome is an intractable form of childhood epilepsy associated with deleterious mutations in <i>SCN1A</i>, the gene encoding neuronal sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. Earlier studies using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have produced mixed results regarding the importance of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in human inhibitory versus excitatory neurons. We studied a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation (p.S1328P) identified in a pair of twins with Dravet Syndrome and generated iPSC-derived neurons from these patients. Characterization of the mutant channel revealed a decrease in current amplitude and hypersensitivity to steady-state inactivation. We then differentiated Dravet-Syndrome and control iPSCs into telencephalic excitatory neurons or medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-like inhibitory neurons. Dravet inhibitory neurons showed deficits in sodium currents and action potential firing, which were rescued by a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 transgene, whereas Dravet excitatory neurons were normal. Our study identifies biophysical impairments underlying a deleterious Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation and supports the hypothesis that Dravet Syndrome arises from defective inhibitory neurons."

Earlier studies using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have produced mixed results regarding the importance of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in human inhibitory versus excitatory neurons. We studied a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation (p.S1328P) identified in a pair of twins with Dravet Syndrome and generated iPSC-derived neurons from these patients. Characterization of the mutant channel revealed a decrease in current amplitude and hypersensitivity to steady-state inactivation. We then differentiated Dravet-Syndrome and control iPSCs into telencephalic excitatory neurons or medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-like inhibitory neurons. Dravet inhibitory neurons showed deficits in sodium currents and action potential firing, which were rescued by a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 transgene, whereas Dravet excitatory neurons were normal. Our study identifies biophysical impairments underlying a deleterious Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation and supports the hypothesis that Dravet Syndrome arises from defective inhibitory neurons."

Seizures in Dravet Syndrome appear early in infancy, progress throughout childhood, and are often accompanied by developmental\u00a0delays in language, motor function, learning and social skills (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dravet, 2011</a>). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the <i>SCN1A</i> gene are the most common genetic basis for Dravet Syndrome (<a href=\"#bib2\">Catterall et\u00a0al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Escayg and Goldin, 2010</a>). <i>SCN1A</i> encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, which contributes the fast depolarization of neuronal membranes during an action potential. Loss of one copy of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 might be expected to reduce neuronal excitability, but paradoxically the genetic perturbation causes epilepsy. Initial insights into the neurobiological function of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 came from studies of a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome, where the loss of one copy of <i>Scn1a</i> impaired the excitability of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons but not excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2006</a>). The disproportionate contribution of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 to the excitability of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and thalamus was confirmed by additional studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cheah et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dutton et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kalume et\u00a0al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Martin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ogiwara et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tai et\u00a0al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsai et al., 2015</a>), but the effect of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation in the mouse is dependent on the genetic background with seizures occurring in the C57/B6 background but absent in the 129 background (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mistry et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ogiwara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rubinstein et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsai et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2006</a>)."

                        "text": "The effect of the genetic background on the mouse phenotype has highlighted the importance of characterizing the cellular effects of Dravet mutations in a human genetic context. Until recently, experiments on human neurons required the use of tissues obtained following surgeries. However, the development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology (<a href=\"#bib46\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>) has made it possible to generate neurons from patients with disease-causing mutations. Several research groups have used iPSCs to study the pathophysiology of Dravet Syndrome. Two studies demonstrated impairment of action potential firing in patient iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons without examining the excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Higurashi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2016</a>). Two other studies reported elevated excitability and increased sodium currents in patient-derived excitatory neurons alone (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jiao et al., 2013</a>) or both excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). The precise reason for differences between the studies is unclear; however, differences in the generation of specific neuronal cell types likely contribute to the discrepancy. A side-by-side comparison of inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons derived from Dravet and control iPSCs, including detailed cellular characterization of the neuronal cell types would help to resolve some of the controversy surrounding these studies."

We characterized the effect of this mutation on the biophysical properties of the channel in human neurons and used patient-derived iPSCs to study the consequence of this mutation on the activity of inhibitory and excitatory telencephalic neurons. We found that the disease-associated mutation impairs both functional expression and channel gating of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. We also found that inhibitory neurons from the Dravet patients have reduced sodium currents and a pronounced defect in action potential firing particularly when stimulated by large injections of current. In contrast, both the sodium currents and the excitability of excitatory neurons from Dravet patients were indistinguishable from those of control subjects. The reduced excitability of Dravet inhibitory neurons could be rescued by ectopic expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, while reducing Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 levels by RNAi in wild-type inhibitory neurons could phenocopy the Dravet cells. Together these findings suggest that the p.S1328P mutation reduces the function of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channel, which selectively impairs the activity of inhibitory neurons in humans."

Sequencing of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 coding sequence from these patients revealed a serine to proline mutation at position 1328 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; Reference mRNA: GenBank AB093548.1; reference protein: GenBank BAC21101.1). The Serine-1328 residue is located in a voltage-sensing transmembrane segment of the protein, and it is conserved in human and mouse Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 \u03b1 subunits. This mutation has previously been described in other individuals with Dravet Syndrome (SCN1A Infobase: <a href=\"http://www.scn1a.info/\">http://www.scn1a.info/</a>; SCN1A variant database: <a href=\"http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/scn1amutations/\">http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/scn1amutations/</a>) but the functional effects of the mutation are not known. To determine whether the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-p.S1328P mutation alters the function of the channel we expressed wild type and mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels in human neurons. To distinguish the exogenous from the endogenous channels we introduced a second mutation, p.F383S, that makes the channel resistant to tetrodotoxin (TTX). This allowed us to block the activity of the endogenous channels with TTX (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cest\u00e8le et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2013</a>) to measure the currents carried by the expressed channels in isolation. Expressing Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 constructs in neurons allowed us to examine the function of the mutant channel in cells that express the correct auxiliary subunits and other molecular partners that regulate channel gating. We made two lentiviruses: mCherry-T2A-Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S that expresses the engineered control protein and mCherry from a bisystronic message (<a href=\"#bib9\">Donnelly et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Szymczak et al., 2004</a>), and mCherry-T2A-Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P, which expresses the mutant channel and mCherry. Both viruses contained a Doxycline (Dox)-regulated promoter that allowed us to control the expression of the constructs. We transduced the lentiviral vectors into human neurons derived from the human ESC line H9 that expresses the transcription factor from the NgN2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). NgN2-expression generates highly homogeneous and rapidly maturing human excitatory neurons in easily scalable quantity (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>)."

We found that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P were expressed at similar levels in NgN2 neurons following treatment with either 0.1 \u00b5g/ml or 2 \u00b5g/ml Dox in the culture media (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), suggesting that the mutation does not affect the expression of the channel. We then used whole-cell patch clamp to measure the TTX-resistant sodium currents. We found that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P produces currents that are significantly smaller than those of control channels when the cells are treated with both 0.1 \u00b5g/ml and 2 \u00b5g/ml Dox (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 1</a>). This suggests that the S1328P either affects the number of channels on the cell surface or the activity of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channel. The trend that the current observed in the presence of 2 \u00b5g/ml Dox was larger than that observed in the presence of 0.1 \u00b5g/ml Dox in the cells expressing the mutant channels but not the control channels suggests that there is a defect in trafficking the channel to the cell surfaces (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 1</a>). We also examined the biophysical properties of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P channels that do make it to the cell surface. The activation voltage (V<sub>1/2</sub>) was hyperpolarized by around 5 mV, while the steady-state inactivation voltage (V<sub>1/2</sub><sup>\u2019</sup>) showed a hyperpolarizing shift of around 15 mV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 2</a>). This increased sensitivity for activation is likely to enhance the activity of the channel in neurons slightly, however, the much larger increase in steady-state inactivation offsets this effect and probably results in a net loss of function by reducing the fraction of channels that are available to open under prolonged current injections."

We used RT-PCR to verify that the reprogramming vectors were lost in most iPSC cell lines after the 15<sup>th</sup> passage (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The iPSC lines expressed the pluripotency markers NANOG, TRA-2-49, OCT3/4 SOX2, and LIN28 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). Four of the iPSC lines responded well to neural differentiation, which was evident by the formation of neural rosettes (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We examined the genomic integrity of the iPSC lines at early passages (passage six to eight) by identifying copy number variants (CNVs) and compared them with CNVs in the source skin fibroblasts. The iPSCs had between three and sixteen novel CNVs, all of which were less than 1.5 Mb in size and none of which occurred in well annotated pathogenic regions (<a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The number of novel CNVs in each cell line was below the median number observed in a previous SNP array based characterization of reprogramming associated CNVs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hussein et al., 2011</a>). We also generated six iPSC lines derived from 4 control subjects, 2 males and 2 females, none of whom had a diagnosis of epilepsy. In addition to these iPSCs lines we also included the human embryonic stem cell line H9 (ESC-H9).

Briefly, iPSC/ESC colonies were dislodged from culture vessels by dispase and grown in suspension for five days in the presence of the BMP pathway inhibitor Dorsomorphin (5 \u00b5M) and the TGF\u03b2 pathway inhibitor SB431542 (10 \u00b5M) to form embryoid bodies (EBs).

The rosettes were then isolated mechanically and expanded in suspension for seven days before plating onto glass coverslips for post-mitotic neuronal differentiation.

Among all neurons that were identified by MAP2 staining, about 30% were co-stained by an anti-GABA antibody (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), suggesting that they produce the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Among the inhibitory (GABA<sup>+</sup>) neurons, approximately 50% co-expressed Calretinin, and 2%-8% expressed Somatostatin, and the rest expressed neither marker (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). We did not identify any cells that expressed Parvalbumin, possibly because these cells emerge during postnatal development and require both cell-intrinsic and non-intrinsic factors for specification, migration and maturation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Okaty et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sultan et\u00a0al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wonders and Anderson, 2006</a>). The expression of Calretinin and low expression of Somatostatin are similar to an earlier report that describes development of telecephalic interneurons using an MGE-biased differentiation protocol (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nicholas et al., 2013</a>). However, an alternative scenario could be that the Calretinin-expressing neurons in our current study arise from a population of CGE-like progenitors, as in the adult mammalian cortex where Calretinin expression is mostly restricted to CGE-lineage interneurons (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wonders and Anderson, 2006</a>). To distinguish between the two possibilities, we performed double immunostaining for NKX2.1 and Calretinin in differentiating cells before plating them to rat astrocyte feeders. We observed co-expression of NKX2.1 and Calretinin in many cells with progenitor-like morphology and also in a population of cells showing neuronal morphology (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, expression of SP8, an aforementioned transcription factor found in CGE-derived progenitors and neurons, was barely detected in our iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). These results are consistent with findings from the differentiating neural rosettes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) and support the idea that the Calretinin-expressing inhibitory neurons in our study originate from MGE-like progenitors."

We used fluorescent indicators to select the mature neurons for electrophysiological characterization. To identify excitatory neurons we used a lentivirus that expresses EGFP under the control of the CaMKII promoter (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shcheglovitov et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To identify inhibitory neurons we used a lentivirus in which GFP is expressed under the control of an enhancer sequence that is found between the mouse <i>Dlx1</i> and <i>Dlx2</i> genes (Dlxi1/2b-GFP, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The mouse Dlxi1/2b enhancer is homologous to its counterpart in the human genome and labels MGE-like progenitor cells differentiated from mouse ES cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Approximately 65% of the Dlxi1/2b-GFP labeled neurons were co-stained by an anti-GABA antibody, indicating they are inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and E</a>). To further identify the cells that were being patch clamped we collected the cell soma after every recording and used single-cell RT-PCR to measure the expression of GAD65 and GAD67. About 70% of the Dlxi1/2b-GFP neurons expressed at least one of the two markers, consistent with the results of the anti-GABA staining and independently of whether the neurons were derived from control or Dravet iPSCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Furthermore, by single-cell RT-PCR only a small percentage of these GAD67/65-positive inhibitory neurons (0.9% of the control sample group and 5.4% of the Dravet group) expressed 5HT3aR, a serotonin receptor and specific marker for CGE-derived inhibitory interneurons, while more than 60% (for both the control and Dravet groups) expressed Calbindin, which is commonly found in MGE-derived interneurons (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results are consistent with other characteristics of the neural differentiation protocol and indicate that the cellular composition of the inhibitory neuron pool is dominated by MGE-like rather than CGE-like lineages."

The\u00a0Inhibitory neurons fired trains of action potentials upon a 1000-millisecond current injection, and the fraction of cells firing continuous trains increased as the cells matured at least until differentiation day 90 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). At this later stage, 73.3% of the inhibitory neurons showed an accommodating pattern of action potential firing; 3.3% had a non-accommodating pattern; a 5% showed a stuttering pattern; and the remaining 18.4% fired at most a few or single action potentials (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We also observed spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents that were blocked by Gabazine indicating that the cells have functional GABAergic synapses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). To determine whether the iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons could integrate into a neural circuit and form functional inhibitory synapses, we infected the cells with a lentivirus expressing Channelrodopsin 2 fused to YFP under the control of the human synapsin-1 promoter (pLenti-Syn1-ChR2(H134R)-YFP) and engrafted them into rat hippocampal organotypic slices. After 8 weeks on the slices, multipolar, ChR2-YFP positive neurons could be observed in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) containing presynaptic-bouton like structures (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). We used whole-cell patch clamp to measure the currents in the transduced cells and found that illumination with 470 nm light could reliably activate ChR2 and elicit repetitive action potentials (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). Patch clamping of rat neurons surrounding the axons of ChR2-YFP-cells revealed light-driven Gabazine sensitive postsynaptic currents (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4D and E</a>) indicating that the engrafted human inhibitory neurons formed synapses with the rat neurons. Taken together these experiments suggest that the protocol for specifying inhibitory neurons from iPSCs generated cells that expressed the ventral telecephalic and terminal identity markers, fired repetitive action potentials and formed functional GABAergic synapses."

The example I<sub>Na</sub> traces in (<b>C</b>) were selected to represent the median values of all control excitatory neurons and all Dravet excitatory neurons, respectively. The current trace from the Dravet neuron was scaled relative to the control neuron according to whole-cell capacitance values. Panel (<b>D</b>) describes the current-voltage (I-V) relationships in control (n = 45 cells, 3 subjects) and Dravet (n = 45 cells, 2 subjects) excitatory neurons. p = 0.8225 by t-test of the maximal I<sub>Na</sub> amplitude. (<b>E</b> and <b>F</b>) I<sub>Na</sub> amplitude was reduced in Dravet inhibitory neurons relative to control inhibitory neurons. The example I<sub>Na</sub> traces in (<b>E</b>) were selected the same way as in (<b>C</b>).

At high current injection levels Dravet inhibitory neurons often fired only a few action potentials before entering depolarization block, in contrast to the sustained trains of action potentials observed in the control neurons.

We compared the expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mRNA between inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons derived from human iPSCs. When normalized to the expression of NaV\u03b23 mRNA, which encodes a sodium channel auxiliary subunit uniformly present among subtypes of mouse cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sugino et al., 2006</a>), we observed a 1.6\u20135.6 fold enrichment of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mRNA in cultures of inhibitory neurons relative to excitatory neurons derived from multiple control iPSC lines, Dravet iPSC lines and the hESC line H9 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Using <i>MAPT</i> mRNA as an alternative reference for normalization, we obtained a consistent result for the control iPSC line 8858\u20133 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The data suggest that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression is enriched in inhibitory neurons, and the enrichment can be observed within the time frame of human iPSC in vitro differentiation that is much shorter compared to the natural time course of human brain development preceding disease onset. To examine the functional contribution of enriched Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression, we developed lentiviral expression constructs carrying Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-tRFP-shRNAs (one scramble shRNA sequence and two Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-targeting shRNA sequences in separate vectors; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and a doxycycline-inducible mCherry-T2A-Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-cDNA (mCherry-T2A tagged wild-type Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), which served to decrease or increase Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression in neurons, respectively. We first verified that both shRNAs reduced the expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mRNA by around 60% (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; p&lt;0.005 by Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons following ANOVA). We then transduced the human neurons grown on rat astrocytes and measured I<sub>Na</sub> currents and membrane excitability in neurons that co-express the lentiviral tracers (tRFP or mCherry) and the cell-type reporters (CaMKII-GFP or Dlxi1/2b-GFP). We found that suppressing Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression using the lenti-shRNAs reduced the I<sub>Na</sub> amplitude (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> middle) in Dlxi1/2b-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons derived from the control hESC line H9, but not in the CaMKII-GFP<sup>+</sup> excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> left). Conversely, the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 lenti-cDNA rescued the I<sub>Na</sub> amplitude in the Dlxi1/2b-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons derived from Dravet iPSCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> right). In parallel to the effects on I<sub>Na</sub>, the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-shRNAs impaired action potential firing in control Dlxi1/2b-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), whereas the cDNA rescued action potential firing in the Dravet Dlxi1/2b-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). These results indicate that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 is a major component of I<sub>Na</sub> in inhibitory neurons and plays an important role in controlling the excitability of these cells."

We investigated a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation in a pair of twins with Dravet Syndrome and found that it resulted in a decrease in the current carried by the channel but not in a complete loss of function. We studied the effects of this mutation on excitatory and inhibitory interneurons by taking great care to generate and characterize human ESC/iPSC-derived telencephalic excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons in parallel. We found that the p.S1328P mutation affected I<sub>Na</sub> and action potential firing specifically in patient-derived inhibitory neurons without affecting excitatory neurons. Furthermore, we determined that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 is expressed at higher levels in human telencephalic inhibitory neurons than in excitatory neurons, and that it makes a disproportionate contribution to the excitability of these cells. This is consistent with previous findings in mouse models of Dravet syndrome that correlated Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression and function in inhibitory interneurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cheah et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dutton et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ogiwara et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ogiwara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tai et al., 2014</a>) but differs from some of the previous findings in iPSC models (<a href=\"#bib18\">Higurashi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jiao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). Specifically, two previous papers have suggested that there is an increase in I<sub>Na</sub> and neuronal excitability in Dravet neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jiao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2013</a>) rather than a selective decrease in I<sub>Na</sub> and excitability in inhibitory neurons as we have observed here. Two other studies (<a href=\"#bib18\">Higurashi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2016</a>) broadly agree with our findings, although the authors only characterized inhibitory neurons, and the developmental origin and trajectory of the inhibitory neurons were not studied."

One possibility is that the different groups studied different sets of mutations which could differentially affect Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression and function.

This correlated with the decreased sodium current and excitability in patient-derived inhibitory neurons."

For example, in two earlier studies the sodium currents were quantified as the inward component of the whole cell current, without pharmacologically eliminating voltage-dependent potassium currents and calcium currents (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jiao et al., 2013</a>) or with calcium currents eliminated only (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2016</a>). This could confound the results as the measurements of current amplitude, kinetics and voltage dependence could be contaminated by membrane conductance to the non-sodium ions."

Although in all four prior studies neural differentiation began with the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), the earlier papers do not provide sufficient information on specific steps of neural differentiation or cell lineage markers for us to determine if the cells are similar to ours. Our neurons resemble inhibitory and excitatory neurons found in the developing human telencephalon, based on the expression of cell-type specific markers in both neural progenitors and neurons. The critical question is whether iPSC-derived neurons in a culture dish fully mimic the neurons in patient brains. While we can\u2019t answer this question definitively, it is encouraging that the neurons in our experiments have similar phenotypes compared to those observed in vivo in multiple mouse model of Dravet Syndrome."

                        "text": "Why does loss of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 have a greater effect on the excitability of inhibitory neurons relative to excitatory neurons? One possibility might be that excitatory neurons are more effective than inhibitory neurons at upregulating other sodium channels in response to loss of one copy of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. Our data suggests that this is not the case. We observed that human Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mRNA was present at higher levels in ESC/iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons than excitatory neurons, and that bi-directional manipulation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression level using lentiviral constructs correlated with I<sub>Na</sub> currents and membrane excitability in the inhibitory neurons. In addition, studies in rodents suggest that cortical inhibitory interneurons express both Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 in their axon initial segments while cortical excitatory neurons express only Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 channels in this cellular compartment (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lorincz and Nusser, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ogiwara et al., 2007</a>). As the axon initial segment plays a key role in the initiation of action potentials, this difference could account for the disproportionate effect of loss of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 on inhibitory neuron firing in Dravet Syndrome."

First, human ES/iPS cell colonies were detached from DR4 MEF feeders with Dispase and grown as suspension culture for five days to form embryoid bodies (EBs). The EB medium was the standard human ES medium supplemented with SMAD inhibitors Dorsomorphin (5 \u00b5M, Sigma Aldrich) and SB431542 (10 \u00b5M, Tocris) but without FGF2. Next, EBs were plated for the induction of neural rosettes over 10 days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The neural induction media contained Neurobasal-A (Base medium, Gibco), B-27 without Vitamin-A (2%, Gibco), GlutaMax (1%, Gibco), and Penstrep (100 units/mL working concentration, Gibco). Human recombinant FGF2 (20 ng/ml for dorsal telencephalon induction, 10 ng/ml for ventral telencephalon-MGE induction; R&amp;D; systems), EGF (20 ng/ml, EMD Millipore), IGF1 (10 ng/ml, EMD Millipore) and small molecules SAG (10 nM and 100 nM, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, New York) and retinoic acid (RA) (10 \u00b5M, Sigma Aldrich) were added to the neural induction media in specific combinations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Neural rosettes were isolated by mechanical picking and re-plated for neuronal differentiation. For rosettes harvested from the dorsal telencephalon\u00a0patterning\u00a0scheme, an extra expansion step was included, where the neural progenitors were allowed to proliferate in suspended neurospheres over seven days (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The neuronal differentiation was divided into an initial stage (20 days) and a secondary, astrocyte- supported stage (~2 months), where the immature human neurons were co-cultured with a rat cortical astrocyte monolayer. The neuronal differentiation media contained Neurobasal-A (Base medium, Gibco), B-27 without Vitamin-A (2%, Gibco), GlutaMax (1%, Gibco), and Penstrep (100 units/mL working concentration, Gibco), recombinant human BDNF (10 ng/ml, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, New Jersey) and recombinant human NT-3 (10 ng/ml, PeproTech). Additional neurotrophic or signaling molecules were used for the initial stage of inhibitory neuron differentiation. Between Differentiation Day 15 and 25 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we used BDNF (10 ng/ml, extra, PeproTech) and NT-3 (10 ng/ml, extra, PeproTech), GDNF (10 ng/ml, R&amp;D; systems), cyclic AMP (0.5\u2009mM, Sigma Aldrich) and BMP4 (20 ng/ml, R&amp;D; systems); between Differentiation Day 25 and 35, we used BDNF (10 ng/ml, extra, PeproTech) and NT-3 (10 ng/ml, extra, PeproTech), GDNF (10 ng/ml, R&amp;D; systems), cyclic AMP (0.5\u2009mM, Sigma Aldrich) and IGF1 (10 ng/ml, EMD Millipore).

Induced pluripotent stem cell methods are used here to determine the functional impact of a Dravet Syndrome mutation. Previous published work on iPSC-derived neurons has given inconsistent results. The highlights of this work are: 1. well-developed and well-defined iPSC-derived neurons; 2. evidence that a Dravet Syndrome mutation impairs the sodium currents and excitability of inhibitory neurons; 3. evidence that excitatory pyramidal cells are unaffected; and 4. evidence that the nonpsychotropic marijuana component cannabidiol inhibits excitability of excitatory neurons and increases excitability of inhibitory neurons."

Although this may seem a bit trivial at first glance, it is critical to how the two major findings presented here are interpreted. We have learned much about interneuron diversity and interneuron origins since the initial 2006 Catterall et al. identification of a defect in firing associated with a GABA-expressing bipolar neuron from Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutant mice. Rubenstein, Fishell, Marin and many others have carefully classified GABA-expressing neurons into a wide variety of sub-populations with distinct embryonic origins. From this literature, and looking at the data presented here \u2013 putative interneurons with a telencephalic identity express GABA or GAD (30-50%), and of these 50% express calretinin with a very small percentage expressing SST and none expressing PV. This would suggest that the iPS protocol used enriches for GABA-expressing CR+ interneurons and would be more in line with a Caudal (not Medial) Ganglionic Eminence origin designation; current-clamp firing properties shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3G and 5E</a> are also consistent with a CR+ Regular-Spiking Non-Pyramidal cell designation. Interneurons derived from the MGE are primarily parvalbumin+ (~65%) and somatostatin+ (~35%) sub-types and it is rare to have CR+ interneurons derived from an MGE lineage (Anderson et al. Cereb. Cortex 2002; Xu et al. J. Neurosci. 2004; Butt et al. Neuron 2005; Fishell et al. Novartis Found. Symp. 2007; Gelman et al. Jaspers 2012). It would be helpful to know if the interneurons shown here also express 5HT3a receptors (see below), VIP or CoupTFII, as this would further help in distinguishing interneuron sub-populations."

Cortex 1999; Chamberland et al. Front. Cell Neurosci. 2010; Urban et al. Acta Biol. Hung. 2002), then the interpretation that DS-derived interneurons have reduced sodium current and reduced firing would functionally result in a loss of inhibitory tone onto inhibitory neurons or an overall disinhibition placed in the context of a compete network environment. This would not be a reasonable explanation for epilepsy in DS, as it would be associated with increased network excitability and likely an increased propensity toward seizures. Nor would this be entirely consistent with mouse data from Catterall and other groups who have demonstrated that Cre-mediated inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in SST+ or PV+ interneuron sub-populations (which primarily target excitatory neurons) can result in epileptic phenotypes."

First, the representative traces in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> do not match very well with the quantitative input-output plots. The excitatory neuron appears to exhibit spike frequency accommodation, as expected in the plot but not the sample traces. Whereas the control interneuron, which would not be expected to show SFA does appear to accommodate. Second, the spike firing rates shown for interneurons and excitatory neurons appear equivalent. But mature interneurons should have much higher firing frequencies."

In the revised manuscript we expressed a TTX-resistant version (Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P) of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in human neurons and compared it to a control lacking the S1328P mutation. We expressed the channel in NgN2-induced, hESC-H9-derived human telencephalic neurons and found that while the mutant channel is expressed at similar levels to the control channel it has defects in trafficking that result in reduced expression of functional channels. In addition, has altered gating properties including a hyperpolarizing shift of the steady-state inactivation curve of 15 mV and a minor hyperpolarizing shift of the activation voltage of the channel of 5 mV. On balance, the impairment in trafficking and the increased inactivation results in a channel that is less active particularly during trains of action potentials when the fraction of inactivated channels is likely to accumulate. This in fact is what we observed in the patient cells.

Although this may seem a bit trivial at first glance, it is critical to how the two major findings presented here are interpreted. We have learned much about interneuron diversity and interneuron origins since the initial 2006 Catterall et al. identification of a defect in firing associated with a GABA-expressing bipolar neuron from Nav1.1 mutant mice. Rubenstein, Fishell, Marin and many others have carefully classified GABA-expressing neurons into a wide variety of sub-populations with distinct embryonic origins. From this literature, and looking at the data presented here \u2013 putative interneurons with a telencephalic identity express GABA or GAD (30-50%), and of these 50% express calretinin with a very small percentage expressing SST and none expressing PV. This would suggest that the iPS protocol used enriches for GABA-expressing CR+ interneurons and would be more in line with a Caudal (not Medial) Ganglionic Eminence origin designation; current-clamp firing properties shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3G and 5E</a> are also consistent with a CR+ Regular-Spiking Non-Pyramidal cell designation. Interneurons derived from the MGE are primarily parvalbumin+ (~65%) and somatostatin+ (~35%) sub-types and it is rare to have CR+ interneurons derived from an MGE lineage (Anderson et al. Cereb. Cortex 2002; Xu et al. J. Neurosci. 2004; Butt et al. Neuron 2005; Fishell et al. Novartis Found. Symp. 2007; Gelman et al. Jaspers 2012). It would be helpful to know if the interneurons shown here also express 5HT3a receptors (see below), VIP or CoupTFII, as this would further help in distinguishing interneuron sub-populations.</i>"

(Cell Stem Cell, 2013, PMID 23642366) demonstrated that human iPSC/ESC-derived MGE progenitors produce up to ~80% Calretinin positive GABAergic neurons in the time frame of their neural differentiation (up to 30 weeks). The authors also showed that human fetal MGE explants produced prevalent Calretinin-positive GABAergic neurons. Importantly, the authors demonstrated co-expression of Calretinin and the MGE marker NKX2.1. Specifically, Calretinin expression and the NKX2.1-GFP reporter overlapped in hiPSC/ESC derived GABAergic neurons and Calretinin staining was also found in the 15-gestational-week human fetal MGE. Although it is believed that in the adult mammalian brain Calretinin expression is largely restricted to CGE-derived interneurons, it appears that human interneurons go through a stage in which they express calretinin. To examine this possibility we performed co-immunostaining for Calretinin and NKX2.1 in our inhibitory neuron cultures at roughly half way of the differentiation protocol, we found many NKX2.1-positive progenitor-like cells co-express Calretinin, and we also identified cells with neuronal morphology that co-express both.

Nor would this be entirely consistent with mouse data from Catterall and other groups who have demonstrated that Cre-mediated inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in SST+ or PV+ interneuron sub-populations (which primarily target excitatory neurons) can result in epileptic phenotypes.</i>"

Urban et al. (Acta Biol. Hung. 2002) found that \u201c(in the hippocampal CA1 subfield, one type of CR positive terminals) formed symmetric synapses on both pyramidal and interneuron dendrites. Distribution of postsynaptic targets showed that 26.8% of the targets were CR positive interneuron dendrites, and 25.2% proved to be proximal pyramidal dendrites. CR negative interneuron dendrites were also contacted (12.4%).\u201d Having said this, the only convincing way to answer whether the human neurons that we are generating in our system target excitatory or inhibitory neurons and affect network excitability is to study them in a network that reflects the relative numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the human cortex.
