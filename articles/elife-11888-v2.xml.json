Such blooms can trigger secondary blooms of planktonic bacteria that consist of swift successions of distinct bacterial clades, most prominently members of the <i>Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria</i> and the alphaproteobacterial <i>Roseobacter</i> clade. We investigated such successions during spring phytoplankton blooms in the southern North Sea (German Bight) for four consecutive years. Dense sampling and high-resolution taxonomic analyses allowed the detection of recurring patterns down to the genus level. Metagenome analyses also revealed recurrent patterns at the functional level, in particular with respect to algal polysaccharide degradation genes. We, therefore, hypothesize that even though there is substantial inter-annual variation between spring phytoplankton blooms, the accompanying succession of bacterial clades is largely governed by deterministic principles such as substrate-induced forcing."

                        "text": "Correlation values were considered only when p-value &lt;0.05. Spearman rank correlations measure the strength of association between two ranked variables. A precondition (assumption) for this nonparametric statistical analysis is that the two variables share a monotonic relationship (i.e. when one variable increases, the other either consistently increases as well or consistently decreases). This monotonic relationship does, however, not need to be linear. While no particularly strong correlations were found between major algae groups and bacterioplankton clades, some noteworthy trends were detected. For example, <i>Ulvibacter</i> abundances were positively correlated with diatoms (in particular centrales) and negatively correlated with silicoflagellates, whereas an opposite trend was observed for the VIS1 clade of the NS5 marine group (i.e. negative correlation with diatoms and a positive correlation with silicoflagellates). While the explanatory power of such pairwise rank-based correlations is limited and correlation does not necessarily imply causation, these data suggest at least for <i>Ulvibacter</i> sp. (and to a lesser extent for <i>Formosa</i> clade B) that they are associated with diatoms, while the NS3a, NS5 and NS9 marine groups seemed to be rather positively correlated with flagellates such as dino- and silicoflagellates. The positive correlation between <i>Ulvibacter</i> sp. and diatoms was supported by Spearman rank correlation analysis between the abundances of prominent bacterioplankton clades and distinct phytoplankton groups. <i>Ulvibacter</i> abundances were positively correlated with the diatoms <i>Mediopyxis helysia, Chaetoceros debilis, Chaetoceros minimus, Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii</i> and the <i>Phaeocystis</i> spp. haptophytes. Correlations of other bacterioplankton groups with distinct phytoplankton groups were less pronounced. Noteworthy positive correlations were found between <i>Chattonella</i> spp. and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> abundances (probe CF319a), in particular <i>Marinoscillum</i> spp. (probe CYT-734), <i>Polaribacter</i> spp. (probe POL740) and the NS5/VIS1 and NS3a marine groups. The NS5/VIS1 marine group was negatively correlated with most diatom groups and the <i>Phaeocystis</i> sp. haptophytes, and only positively correlated with <i>Chattonella</i> species. This might indicate a preference for <i>Chattonella</i> spp. or simply reflect that the members of the VIS1 clade of the NS5 marine group were less competitive than other <i>Flavobacteriia</i> under the conditions where other algae dominated. Spearman rank correlations between major bacterioplankton clades and physicochemical parameters were most conclusive for <i>Ulvibacter</i> species. Ulvibacter abundances were positively correlated with chlorophyll <i>a</i>, consistent with the previously detected positive correlation with in particular diatoms. <i>Ulvibacter</i> abundances were also negatively correlated with silicate, phosphate, nitrate and ammonium. In particular the strong negative correlation with silicate, which is the limiting factor for diatom frustule formation, supports a particularly strong association of <i>Ulvibacter</i> spp. and diatoms. Similar but weaker trends were observed also for other bacterioplankton clades, such as <i>Polaribacter, Formosa</i> clade B, or VIS6 clade <i>Cryomorphaceae</i>. Of all genus-level clades, <i>Polaribacter</i> and <i>Formosa</i> clade A showed the strongest associations with temperature."

It should be noted though that these regressions were computed based on log-transformed abundance data and not algae biovolumes (which were not measured). Insofar the in influence of the rather small cell-sized algae such as <i>Chaetoceros miniumus</i> is likely overestimated. Such limitations notwithstanding it is noteworthy that in no case a simple one-to-one relationship between specific algae and specific bacterioplankton groups was obtained so far."

Such blooms can trigger secondary blooms of planktonic bacteria that consist of swift successions of distinct bacterial clades, most prominently members of the <i>Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria</i> and the alphaproteobacterial <i>Roseobacter</i> clade. We investigated such successions during spring phytoplankton blooms in the southern North Sea (German Bight) for four consecutive years. Dense sampling and high-resolution taxonomic analyses allowed the detection of recurring patterns down to the genus level. Metagenome analyses also revealed recurrent patterns at the functional level, in particular with respect to algal polysaccharide degradation genes. We, therefore, hypothesize that even though there is substantial inter-annual variation between spring phytoplankton blooms, the accompanying succession of bacterial clades is largely governed by deterministic principles such as substrate-induced forcing."

                        "text": "Correlation values were considered only when p-value &lt;0.05. Spearman rank correlations measure the strength of association between two ranked variables. A precondition (assumption) for this nonparametric statistical analysis is that the two variables share a monotonic relationship (i.e. when one variable increases, the other either consistently increases as well or consistently decreases). This monotonic relationship does, however, not need to be linear. While no particularly strong correlations were found between major algae groups and bacterioplankton clades, some noteworthy trends were detected. For example, <i>Ulvibacter</i> abundances were positively correlated with diatoms (in particular centrales) and negatively correlated with silicoflagellates, whereas an opposite trend was observed for the VIS1 clade of the NS5 marine group (i.e. negative correlation with diatoms and a positive correlation with silicoflagellates). While the explanatory power of such pairwise rank-based correlations is limited and correlation does not necessarily imply causation, these data suggest at least for <i>Ulvibacter</i> sp. (and to a lesser extent for <i>Formosa</i> clade B) that they are associated with diatoms, while the NS3a, NS5 and NS9 marine groups seemed to be rather positively correlated with flagellates such as dino- and silicoflagellates. The positive correlation between <i>Ulvibacter</i> sp. and diatoms was supported by Spearman rank correlation analysis between the abundances of prominent bacterioplankton clades and distinct phytoplankton groups. <i>Ulvibacter</i> abundances were positively correlated with the diatoms <i>Mediopyxis helysia, Chaetoceros debilis, Chaetoceros minimus, Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii</i> and the <i>Phaeocystis</i> spp. haptophytes. Correlations of other bacterioplankton groups with distinct phytoplankton groups were less pronounced. Noteworthy positive correlations were found between <i>Chattonella</i> spp. and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> abundances (probe CF319a), in particular <i>Marinoscillum</i> spp. (probe CYT-734), <i>Polaribacter</i> spp. (probe POL740) and the NS5/VIS1 and NS3a marine groups. The NS5/VIS1 marine group was negatively correlated with most diatom groups and the <i>Phaeocystis</i> sp. haptophytes, and only positively correlated with <i>Chattonella</i> species. This might indicate a preference for <i>Chattonella</i> spp. or simply reflect that the members of the VIS1 clade of the NS5 marine group were less competitive than other <i>Flavobacteriia</i> under the conditions where other algae dominated. Spearman rank correlations between major bacterioplankton clades and physicochemical parameters were most conclusive for <i>Ulvibacter</i> species. Ulvibacter abundances were positively correlated with chlorophyll <i>a</i>, consistent with the previously detected positive correlation with in particular diatoms. <i>Ulvibacter</i> abundances were also negatively correlated with silicate, phosphate, nitrate and ammonium. In particular the strong negative correlation with silicate, which is the limiting factor for diatom frustule formation, supports a particularly strong association of <i>Ulvibacter</i> spp. and diatoms. Similar but weaker trends were observed also for other bacterioplankton clades, such as <i>Polaribacter, Formosa</i> clade B, or VIS6 clade <i>Cryomorphaceae</i>. Of all genus-level clades, <i>Polaribacter</i> and <i>Formosa</i> clade A showed the strongest associations with temperature."

It should be noted though that these regressions were computed based on log-transformed abundance data and not algae biovolumes (which were not measured). Insofar the in influence of the rather small cell-sized algae such as <i>Chaetoceros miniumus</i> is likely overestimated. Such limitations notwithstanding it is noteworthy that in no case a simple one-to-one relationship between specific algae and specific bacterioplankton groups was obtained so far."

Polysaccharides are varied molecules and can contain many different sugars that can be linked in a number of different ways. During algae blooms bacteria proliferate that are specialized in the degradation of these polysaccharides. In 2012, researchers reported how over the progression of an algae bloom different groups of marine bacteria bloomed in rapid succession. However, it remained unknown whether the same or different groups of bacteria respond to algae blooms at the same place from year to year, and whether or not these bacteria use the same enzymes to degrade the polysaccharides."

The analysis is based on samples collected every week during the spring seasons, and shows that certain groups of related bacteria, known as clades, became common during each bloom. Teeling, Fuchs et al. also found indications that the clades that repeatedly occurred had similar sets of genes for degrading algal polysaccharides, but that the sets were different between the clades."

This phenomenon has been termed 'paradox of the plankton' by G. Evelyn Hutchinson (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hutchinson, 1961</a>). Interactions within planktonic microbial communities are manifold and complex (see <a href=\"#bib2\">Amin et al., (2012)</a> and <a href=\"#bib70\">Worden et al. (2015)</a> for reviews). Still, planktonic microbial communities are simple in comparison to benthic or terrestrial soil communities and thus particularly suitable for the study of microbial community composition dynamics. In recent years, continuous biodiversity studies at long-term sampling stations have started to reveal discernible deterministic patterns within marine microbial plankton communities (see <a href=\"#bib17\">Fuhrman et al. (2015)</a> for a recent review). This is particularly true for less dynamic oligotrophic oceanic regions that are dominated by the\u00a0members of the alphaproteobacterial <i>Pelagibacteriaceae</i> (SAR11 clade) and the cyanobacterial <i>Prochlorococcaceae (Prochlorococcus marinus</i>). By contrast, more dynamic eutrophic coastal regions are subject to frequent system perturbations and thus seldom in a state of equilibrium. This can lead to apparently stochastic changes in bacterioplankton community composition. To capture recurrence of biodiversity patterns in such coastal areas, sampling must occur at the order of weekly to sub-weekly time scales over multiple years. Owing to the lack of such intensively sampled long-term time series data, our current understanding of the extent and predictability of recurring microbial biodiversity patterns for such marine habitats is still limited."

These blooms are highly dynamic phenomena that are time-limited by nutrients, predator grazing and viral infections. Bloom termination results in a short-lived massive release of algal organic matter that is consumed by dedicated clades of heterotrophic bacterioplankton. This trophic connection leads to synchronized blooms of planktonic bacteria during phytoplankton blooms, as has been described in various studies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bell and Kuparinen, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Niu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Teeling et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tan et al., 2015</a>)."

These are further remineralized by particle-associated bacteria while sinking and by benthic bacteria when reaching the sediment, even in the deep sea (e.g. <a href=\"#bib54\">Ruff et al., 2014</a>). The remainder is buried for a long time as kerogen and forms the basis for future oil and gas reservoirs. The ratio between bacterial mineralization and burial of algae-derived organic matter thus has a profound influence on the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (<a href=\"#bib14\">Falkowski et al., 1998</a>). However, the bulk of bacteria during phytoplankton blooms are free-living and not attached to particles or algae. These bacteria play a pivotal role in the mineralization of algae-derived non-particulate dissolved organic matter (DOM)."

This response is typically not uniform, but consists of a series of distinct clades that bloom one after another. In the year 2009, we investigated the response of bacterioplankton to a diatom-dominated spring phytoplankton bloom in the German Bight (<a href=\"#bib63\">Teeling et al., 2012</a>). Within the free-living bacteria (0.2 to 3 \u00b5m) we observed a swift succession of bacterial clades that were dominated by <i>Flavobacteriia</i> and <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i>, with consecutively blooming <i>Ulvibacter (Flavobacteriia), Formosa (Flavobacteriia), Reinekea (Gammaproteobacteria), Polaribacter (Flavobacteriia)</i> genera and SAR92 (<i>Gammaproteobacteria</i>) as prominent clades."

The succession of bacterioplankton clades hence constituted a succession of distinct gene function repertoires, which suggests that changes in substrate availability over the course of the bloom were among the forces that shaped the bacterioplankton community. Dominance of bottom-up over top-down control is assumed to be characteristic for the initial phases of spring phytoplankton blooms. After winter, inorganic nutrients are aplenty, and the overall abundance of microbes is low. When suitable temperature and sunlight conditions are met in spring, algae and subsequently bacteria can enter an almost unrestricted proliferation. In contrast, predators such as flagellates, protists and zooplankton can only start proliferating when their food sources are available in larger numbers. Hence, top-down control by predation sets in only during later bloom phases. This situation is distinct from summer and fall phytoplankton blooms."

The latter indicates a pronounced niche partitioning with respect to algal polysaccharide degradation. Marine algae produce large quantities of distinct polysaccharides, for example storage, cell matrix and cell wall constituents, or as part of extracellular transparent exopolymer particles (TEP). It has been recently shown that in particular <i>Flavobacteriales</i> and <i>Rhodobacterales</i> respond to TEP availability (<a href=\"#bib62\">Taylor et al., 2014</a>). The diversity of algal polysaccharides is too high for a single bacterial species to harbor all the genes required for the complete degradation of all naturally occurring variants. Thus, polysaccharide-degrading bacteria specialize on dedicated subsets of polysaccharides, which is why the decomposition of algal polysaccharides during and after algal blooms is a concerted effort among distinct bacterial clades with distinct glycan niches (e.g. <a href=\"#bib71\">Xing et al., 2015</a>)."

We analyzed spring bacterioplankton community composition via 16S rRNA catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing, as well as gene function repertoires by deep metagenome sequencing. Our efforts have culminated into the as of yet highest resolved dataset capturing the response of planktonic bacteria to marine spring phytoplankton blooms and have allowed identification of recurring patterns that might ultimately lead to an explanatory model for bacterioplankton succession dynamics during spring algae blooms."

The highest chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations are usually observed at the coastlines including the area around Helgoland Island (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). North Sea spring blooms are thus large-scale phenomena that are, however, influenced by local conditions, such as riverine inputs. At Helgoland island, spring phytoplankton blooms started around mid March when water temperatures surpassed 3 to 5\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The diatoms <i>Chaetoceros debilis and Chaetoceros minimus, Mediopyxis helysia, Rhizosolenia styliformis</i> and <i>Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii,</i> the silicoflagellate <i>Chattonella,</i> the haptophyte <i>Phaeocystis</i> and dinoflagellates dominated these blooms in terms of cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013L</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Relative abundances of these algae varied in no apparent order during the observed blooms, and we have yet to understand the factors that determine these variations. The sizes of the dominant algae taxa are different, with <i>Chaetoceros minimus</i> and in particular <i>Phaeocystis</i> spp. featuring the smallest cells and <i>Mediopyxis helysia</i> and <i>Rhizosolenia styliformis</i> featuring the largest cells. Spherical <i>Phaeocystis</i> spp. cells for example have estimated biovolumes of ~50 to 250 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>, whereas elipsoid cylindrical <i>Mediopyxis helysia</i> cells have a biovolume of ~82,000 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> and for <i>Rhizosolenia styliformis</i> even a biovolume of ~282,000 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> has been reported (<a href=\"#bib48\">Olenina, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Loebl et al., 2013</a>).

Microbial communities in nutrient-rich 'green' surface oceans by contrast feature higher proportions of heterotrophic species that feed on more complex organic substrates. In particular during phytoplankton blooms, the release of algae-derived organic matter selects for fast growing species with genomic adaptations towards algal biomass remineralization. These are typically members of the <i>Flavobacteriia</i> and <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> classes and the alphaproteobacterial <i>Roseobacter</i> clade. Similarly adapted species from these clades compete for substrates during phytoplankton blooms with variation in which species prevail.

For example, even though algal biomass of the 2012 spring bloom was dominated by silicoflatellate <i>Chattonella</i> spp. and not by diatoms as was true for the three preceding years, the respective bacterioplankton communities were strikingly similar. Likewise only few bacterioplankton taxa seemed to be weakly correlated with dedicated phytoplankton taxa, and no clear correlation was found between distinct bacterioplankton taxa and individual distinct diatom clades in statistical analyses (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary files 6</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">7</a>). It seems that phytoplankton community composition did not exert a strong effect on the composition of the free-living non-phycosphere bacterioplankton community. Instead, the dominating algae (in terms of biomass) seemed to produce similar or perhaps identical types of substrates for specifically adapted clades of heterotrophic bacterioplankton. It is therefore conceivable that recurrence is more pronounced on the functional level than on the taxonomic level, since species from different taxa with similar ecophysiological niches might functionally substitute each other in different years. This hypothesis is supported by the bacterioplankton communities' similar CAZyme gene repertoires in the 2009 to 2012 spring blooms and in particular the consistency on class level that was almost unaffected by distinct blooming clades, yet needs to be further tested by deep metatranscriptome sequencing and metaproteomics during multiple spring phytoplankton blooms in future studies. Considering the extent of recurrence, our combined metagenome data (&gt;5 million predicted proteins) should provide sufficient search space for such an analysis."

We have shown before that temperature exerts a strong effect on North Sea bacterioplankton as it selects for temperature-dependent guilds, for example when comparing spring and summer blooms (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lucas et al., 2015</a>). Within short-lived spring blooms, however, the supply of algae-derived organic matter is among the main factors that shape the bacterioplankton composition. In particular the different types of structurally distinct polysaccharides that algae produce in large quantities seem to exert such substrate-induced forcing. Since <i>Flavobacteriia</i> are more specialized on polysaccharides than <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i>, this would also explain, why <i>Flavobacteriia</i> dominated the recurrent clades (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Q\u2013T</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013J</a>) and <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> clades exhibited more stochastic peaks (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Q\u2013T</a>)."

Bacteria will naturally consume the more degradable substrates such as storage polysaccharides (e.g. chrysolaminarin) first, and more recalcitrant substrates (e.g. branched and sulfated polysaccharides) later. TEP for example seems to undergo such selective feeding, as it has been suggested that in particular fucose-rich TEP is less readily degraded than mannose and galactose rich TEP (for review see <a href=\"#bib49\">Passow, 2002</a>). Such selective feeding creates an additional change in substrate availability and leads to a succession of substrate niches for specifically adapted bacterioplankton clades to grow."

Nonetheless, we found clades that recurrently reached high abundances among <i>Flavobacteriia</i> (<i>Formosa, Polaribacter</i>, NS3a marine group, <i>Ulvibacter</i>, VIS6 clade <i>Cryomorphaceae, Tenacibaculum), Gammaproteobacteria (Alteromonadaceae/Colwelliaceae</i>, SAR92, <i>Reinekea</i>) and <i>Roseobacter</i> clade <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> (DC5-80-3, NAC11-7). Recurrence was not only detectable on the taxonomic but also on the functional level with a highly predictable increase in TonB-dependent polysaccharide uptake systems and distinct CAZyme patterns. The niches of abundant bacterioplankton clades are more complex and manifold than the glycan niches that we explore in this study. CAZymes, however, have the advantage that they allow linking of gene repertoires and possible environmental functions in a way currently not feasible for other macromolecules such as proteins and lipids. Our results suggest that besides stochastic also deterministic effects influence phytoplankton-bacterioplankton coupling during blooms. They indicate that during spring phytoplankton blooms similar principles of resource partitioning and specialization are at play as within human gut microbiota that decompose fiber-rich plant material, albeit at a much larger scale. Rather the availability of substrates commonly occurring in microalgae than one-to-one interactions of particular phytoplankton and bacterioplankton species caused the succession of free-living bacterioplankton clades."

When the taxon with the highest weight exceeds an adjustable threshold, the process continues towards the next taxonomic level. The threshold increases with each taxonomic level, i.e. the algorithm becomes more critical while it progresses.

Both, the reference genomes and the sequences selected from the NCBI nr database were selected based on habitat-specific information. This was done manually for the reference genomes and automatically for the NCBI nr database as follows: Each of the hits from the UBLAST search during KIRSTEN analysis can be associated with multiple taxa, since in nr redundant sequences from different taxa are merged. We used this information to extract all taxa associated with a given hit, then combined the taxa of all hits and finally extracted all sequences of these taxa from Genbank. This way a sample-specific streamlined subset of Genbank was generated that greatly sped up the mapping process. Only metagenome reads with at least 95% identity to any sequence in the sample-specific sequence database were used. Reads were subsequently back-mapped to contigs. Since contigs consist of many reads, this way, contigs were associated with multiple taxonomic paths. Taxonomic paths resulting from classification with reference genomes and the habitat-specific streamlined nr were concatenated. Paths representing less than 1% of the reads of a given contig were discarded."

It appears technically sound in design and data reporting, and provides great detail that will inform our understanding of this important phenomenon. My main concern: There are clearly consistencies in the bacterial responses yearly, however the primary conclusion that there are \"recurring patterns\" of bacterioplankton dynamics is not statistically supported, and frankly vague. A clear quantitative (and justified) definition is needed, otherwise one can focus on what parts repeat and say there is a repeating pattern, or focus on differences and say there isn't. The succession details in their earlier Science paper (Teeling et al., 2012) differ here. If one accepts a broad qualitative definition of \"recurring patterns,\" the results are confirmatory of previous work by the authors and others, cited by recent reviews (Buchan et al., Nature Reviews Microbiology, for example), showing that many taxa, including those reported here, have repeated seasonality or bloom responses. Admittedly few prior studies covered the fine temporal scale measured here, and that is a considerable strength."

The spring \"blooms\" are quite variable in their dynamics, as acknowledged by the authors, and the response differs, as expected. If bottom up controls are the dominant factor controlling the bacterial composition as suggested, the why are dynamics not similar within a year when there is a secondary peak of chlorophyll after the first bloom (see specific comments)? Could it be top-down controls?"

For instance, only one member an important group of phytoplankton, the haptophytes, is reported (<i>Phaeocystis</i>) \u2013 are there no others? Additionally, among the most numerically abundant taxa were the Green Algae, which have many significantly different species, but here they are \"lumped\" together. It is unlikely that particular microbial interactions would occur with whole families or orders of phytoplankton, but instead be rather very specific (e.g. see Amin et al. 2015 and references therein). Unfortunately, the manuscript only reports a relatively small number of phytoplankton species \u2013 and it would be good to see calculations of the fraction of total phytoplankton these represent (e.g. biomass totals to compare with chlorophyll-based totals to see what% may be missing. Some chlorophyll increases were not accompanied on a daily basis with counts). Furthermore, the main way the authors have looked for correlation between phytoplankton and bacteria is via Spearman's correlation for apparently all of the years together. By visual examination, many of the \"responding\" bacteria seem to have a delayed reaction to the increases in chlorophyll, so the authors should also look for time-delayed correlations, in addition to year-by-year studies."

Some groups explored with the 16S not found in CARD-FISH are generally ignored, but CARD-FISH could represent as little as about 40% during blooms. Notable such bacteria include <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> (increases in May 2010, 2011,2012).

Linkages between specific bacterial taxa, functions and environmental parameters (principally those associated with phytoplankton blooms) are evident. Yet, as the authors report, this has been shown previously; albeit these \"elsewhere\" environments are generally more oligotrophic, and perhaps subject to less environmental variability (though that is debatable) than the one characterized here. The authors frame their conclusions on the nature of the succession of bacterial groups as being one that is influenced by both \"stochastic processes\" and \"deterministic principles\", however, I did not find the manuscript to be convincingly clear on what they mean by these statements."

Since the blooms of 2010 to 2012 were also less intense than the bloom of 2009, these metaproteomes yielded mostly conventional highly expressed proteins such as chaperonins, ribosomal proteins and transporters. While the proteomes were not deep enough to detect many expressed CAZymes, we could however, as in 2009, detect remarkably high levels of TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors/transporters among the proteins with the highest expression levels. We will use this expression of TonB-dependent receptors as an indirect measure for the expression of CAZyme-encoding polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in a future study. In order to achieve this, we have systematically isolated and sequenced close to 50 genomes of North Sea <i>Flavobacteriia</i>. We are working on a systematic investigation of the co-localization of TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) and CAZymes in PULs of these isolates and predict polysaccharide substrate specificities. We will subsequently use the metaproteome data in conjunction with these (meta-)genomic data to use TBDR expression as a proxy for expression of CAZymes. This is a much more laborious, but also targeted approach, which has the potential for additional insights on relevant polysaccharide substrates, which we plan to publish in a separate paper."

We appreciate their detailed and extended response to many of our technical suggestions, of which they responded to compellingly. The dataset and extensive analysis is indeed very impressive and valuable. However, we were surprised and disappointed that the authors made relatively few changes in their manuscript in response to our main concerns, so our view of the manuscript in terms of the novelty of general conclusions and quantitative assessment of \"recurring patterns\" has not significantly changed. We regret we cannot be more positive after reading their response. We do now better understand what the authors mean by \"recurring patterns,\", i.e., that many clades appear at &gt;5% abundance more than once following a spring bloom. However, we find this general observation itself to not be exceptionally novel. Note, for example, in the abstract as background for the study, the authors state that Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and alphaproteobacteria are known associated with blooms (Abstract). Earlier published studies include reports where the same taxa are found in different years, including after blooms (admittedly with much less comprehensive overall system analysis than this study).</i>"

We did explain the extent of recurrence and what we deem are patterns. We for sure stand by our interpretation of the data we present. As for novelty, we do not claim that we are the first who found blooms of <i>Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria</i> and <i>Roseobacter</i> clade <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> during and after phytoplankton blooms. However, our analysis extends far beyond these high-level taxa and we present high-time resolution data from four consecutive blooms in order to show that many taxa are recurring on the level of genus. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been shown before."
