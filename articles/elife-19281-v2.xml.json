Here, we show that <i>Guy1</i>, a unique Y chromosome gene of a major urban malaria mosquito <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>, confers 100% female lethality when placed on the autosomes. We show that the small GUY1 protein (56 amino acids in length) causes female lethality and that males carrying the transgene are reproductively more competitive than their non-transgenic siblings under laboratory conditions. The GUY1 protein is a primary signal from the Y chromosome that affects embryonic development in a sex-specific manner. Our results have demonstrated, for the first time in mosquitoes, the feasibility of stable transgenic manipulation of sex ratios using an endogenous gene from the male-determining chromosome. These results provide insights into the elusive M factor and suggest exciting opportunities to reduce mosquito populations and disease transmission."

Here, we show that <i>Guy1</i>, a unique Y chromosome gene of a major urban malaria mosquito <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>, confers 100% female lethality when placed on the autosomes. We show that the small GUY1 protein (56 amino acids in length) causes female lethality and that males carrying the transgene are reproductively more competitive than their non-transgenic siblings under laboratory conditions. The GUY1 protein is a primary signal from the Y chromosome that affects embryonic development in a sex-specific manner. Our results have demonstrated, for the first time in mosquitoes, the feasibility of stable transgenic manipulation of sex ratios using an endogenous gene from the male-determining chromosome. These results provide insights into the elusive M factor and suggest exciting opportunities to reduce mosquito populations and disease transmission."

Similarly, the primary molecular signals that determine sex are highly divergent in insects. In honeybees which use the diploid/haploid system, heterozygosity of the <i>complementary sex determiner (csd</i>) gene is the primary signal that initiates female development ( <a href=\"#bib28\">Hasselmann et al., 2008</a>). In silkworms a piRNA gene on the W chromosome triggers female development (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kiuchi et al., 2014</a>). In the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, which has XX/XY sex chromosomes, the collective dose of X-linked signal elements (XSE) functions as the signal that specifies sex in the early embryo (<a href=\"#bib15\">Erickson and Quintero, 2007</a>). However, a dominant male-determining factor (<i>M</i>) on the Y chromosome initiates male development in many other insects that contain XX/XY sex chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sanchez, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Biedler and Tu, 2016</a>). Instead of a well differentiated and heteromorphic Y chromosome, mosquitoes of the <i>Culicinae</i> subfamily, which includes the genus <i>Aedes</i>, contain a homomorphic sex-determining chromosome that harbors an <i>M</i> factor in the male-determining locus (<i>M</i>-locus). A novel RNA-binding protein named <i>Nix</i> was recently shown to be an <i>M</i> factor in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hall et al., 2015</a>)."

Sex-specific splicing of <i>dsx</i> and <i>fru</i> pre-mRNAs leads to the production of sex-specific DSX and FRU protein isoforms, which program sexual differentiation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bopp et al., 2014</a>). The alternative splicing of <i>dsx</i> and <i>fru</i> pre-mRNAs is often controlled by a protein complex that includes a fast-evolving <i>transformer</i> (TRA) and a conserved <i>transformer 2</i> (TRA2), where TRA is the sex-specific protein in this TRA/TRA2 complex. Indeed, TRA often functions as an intermediate that transduces the selected sexual fate from the primary signal to the DSX and FRU effector molecules (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bopp et al., 2014</a>). For example, in the medfly <i>Ceratitis capitata</i>, which has XX/XY sex chromosomes, a functional TRA is produced in the zygotic XX embryo as a result of splicing by a maternally deposited TRA/TRA2 complex, leading to female-specific <i>dsx</i> and <i>fru</i> splicing and thus the female sex, which is then maintained by the self-sustaining loop of <i>tra</i> splicing and function. In males, a yet-to-be-discovered M factor interrupts this loop of <i>tra</i> splicing, leading to the male sex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pane et al., 2002</a>). Sex-specific splicing of <i>dsx</i> and <i>fru</i> has been described in both <i>Aedes</i> and <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes, suggesting the presence of a TRA-like activity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Scali et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Salvemini et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2013</a>).

The <i>Anopheles</i> Y chromosome also regulates mating behavior (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fraccaro et al., 1977</a>). There is tremendous interest in deciphering Y gene function in non-model insects, including <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes, to shed light on the mechanism and evolution of sexual differentiation. There has also been strong interest in Y chromosome genes in <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes for translational motivations. Only female mosquitoes transmit disease pathogens because only females feed on blood. Thus, it is ideal, if not required, to release only males when considering genetic approaches for reducing mosquito populations or for replacing competent vector populations with populations that are refractory to disease transmission (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib13\">Collins, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Benedict and Robinson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Windbichler et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Black et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al., 2012</a>]). A better understanding of the Y chromosome function in sex-determination and male reproduction may provide novel targets for interference and lead to several practical applications. For example, transgenic lines may be obtained that produce male-only mosquitoes, resulting in more cost-effective mass production and sex separation methods than current approaches (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib42\">Papathanos et al., 2009</a>]). Furthermore, releasing such transgenic males is theoretically much more efficient than classic sterile insect techniques in achieving population reduction and disease control because of the added benefit of male-bias in subsequent generations (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thomas et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schliekelman et al., 2005</a>)."

Several Y genes were recently discovered in <i>An. stephensi</i> and <i>An. gambiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Criscione et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hall et al., 2013</a>) by sequencing males and females separately. None of these genes is homologous to the <i>Nix</i> gene in <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hall et al., 2015</a>) or encodes a predicted RNA-binding protein or splicing factor. However, among the <i>An. gambiae</i> Y chromosome genes, <i>gYG2 (An. gambiae</i> Y\u00a0Gene 2) is the most likely candidate for the <i>M</i> factor because it showed early embryonic expression (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hall et al., 2013</a>) and it is the only Y gene that is shared among all species within the <i>An. gambiae</i> species complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hall et al., 2016</a>). In a recent report, <i>gYG2</i> (renamed YOB by the authors) was shown to confer female-specific lethality in a transient embryonic assay and shift <i>doublesex (dsx)</i> splicing towards the male isoform in an <i>An. gambiae</i> cell line, suggesting that gYG2/YOB functions as an <i>M</i> factor in <i>An. gambiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krzywinska et al., 2016</a>). Among the four Y genes identified in <i>An. stephensi, Guy1</i> is the best candidate for the <i>M factor</i> because it is transcribed the earliest among all Y genes, at the very onset of embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib14\">Criscione et al., 2013</a>)."

Not a single transgenic female older than the third instar has been detected since we established the <i>nGuy1</i> lines, while 2661 transgenic positive males were identified over 15 generations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Similar to what was observed during the transient assay, the <i>Guy1m</i> line showed no male-bias (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Both <i>nGuy1</i> and <i>Guy1m</i> transgenes are expressed in the early embryos in their respective lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>). <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> shows the numbers of transgene positive and negative males and females of the seventh generation (G<sub>7</sub>). The lack of sex-bias in the non-transgenic progeny in all three lines indicates autosomal insertion of the transgenes."

To mitigate the effect of different genetic backgrounds, transgenic males and their non-transgenic sibling males were subjected to competition for wild type virgin females. Two days after emergence, 20 transgenic males and 20 of their non-transgenic male siblings were placed in a 44 oz cup to compete for 10 wild type virgin females. The progeny of these females was screened for the <i>Guy1</i> transgene and sexed at the L3 larval stage. Biological triplicates were performed for both <i>nGuy1</i> lines. It was experimentally determined that transgenic females do not survive to the L3 stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Thus, the expected fractions for transgenic males, non-transgenic females, and non-transgenic males were 1/7, 3/7, and 3/7, respectively, assuming equal reproductive capability of the <i>nGuy1</i> males and their siblings (see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> for genotype explanation).

                                "text": "The <i>M</i> factor is a primary signal from the male-determining chromosome or locus that triggers male development. We have previously shown that <i>Guy1</i> is the earliest expressed Y chromosome gene and it is transcribed at the onset of maternal-to-zygotic transition, prior to sex-determination (<a href=\"#bib14\">Criscione et al., 2013</a>). We have now shown in transgenic lines that the native <i>Guy1</i> promoter is able to direct <i>Guy1</i> transcription as well as GUY1 function when placed in the autosome of genetic females which lack the Y chromosome. Thus, <i>Guy1</i> is a primary signal, not a secondary signal, from the Y chromosome. We have also provided evidence that the small GUY1 protein is the functional molecule by analyzing various <i>Guy1</i> mutants or constructs in transgenic lines. When ectopically expressed in females, the small GUY1 protein confers 100% female lethality during embryonic and early larvae stages. As discussed in detail below, manipulations of master switches of sex-determination also cause sex-specific lethality in fruit flies and nematodes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Thomas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schutt and Nothiger, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Penalva and S\u00e1nchez, 2003</a>).\u00a0Taken together, we suggest that <i>Guy1</i> is a strong candidate for the <i>M</i> factor in <i>An. stephensi</i>. Unlike the newly discovered <i>M</i> factor <i>Nix</i> in <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hall et al., 2015</a>), ectopic expression of <i>Guy1</i> did not produce masculinized XX females. However, a recently reported <i>M</i> factor in <i>An. gambiae</i>, gYG2/YOB, also confers female-specific lethality instead of sex conversion in a transient embryonic assay using in vitro\u00a0synthesized YOB mRNA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krzywinska et al., 2016</a>). The cause of female lethality in the transgenic <i>An. stephensi</i> is unknown. A few scenarios are possible, one being related to dosage compensation, which is a mechanism known to occur in <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes ([<a href=\"#bib22\">Hahn and Lanzaro, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mank et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jiang et al., 2015</a>] <a href=\"#bib45\">Rose et al., 2016</a>), including <i>An. stephensi</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jiang et al., 2015</a>), to ensure equal levels of X-linked gene products in females (XX) and males (XY). It is intriguing that three known master switches of sex-determination, <i>Sex-lethal, Fem/Masc</i>, and <i>xo-lethal 1</i>, also regulate dosage compensation in <i>D. melanogaster, Bombyx mori,</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>, respectively ([<a href=\"#bib52\">Thomas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schutt and Nothiger, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Penalva and S\u00e1nchez, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kiuchi et al., 2014</a>]). Loss of function <i>Sex-lethal</i> alleles cause female embryonic lethality in <i>D. melanogaster</i> due to mis-regulation of dosage compensation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cline, 1978</a>). Similarly, knockdown of <i>Masc</i> also casues female-specific letahlity in <i>B. mori,</i> most likely due to mis-regulation of dosage compensation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kiuchi et al., 2014</a>). If <i>Guy1</i> is also involved in the regulation of dosage compensation in <i>An. stephensi</i>, ectopic expression of <i>Guy1</i> in XX individuals may result in higher than normal levels of expression from X-linked genes, which could be lethal. Indeed, the sex-conversion phenotypes that resulted from ectopic expression of <i>Nix</i> were possible, presumably because <i>Ae. aegypti</i> does not require dosage compensation as it contains homomorphic sex-determining chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hall et al., 2015</a>)."

                                "text": "There is no significant similarity between GUY1 and gYG2/YOB in their primary amino acid sequences. Thus, it will be difficult to determine whether Guy1 and YG2/YOB have a common evolutionary origin, especially as Y chromosome genes tend to evolve rapidly and similarities between very small proteins may not be easy to detect. However, both GUY1 and gYG2/YOB proteins are 56 amino acid long and have helical secondary structures (<a href=\"#bib14\">Criscione et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Krzywinska et al., 2016</a>). In addition, four out of the first five amino acid residues are identical between GUY1 and gYG2/YOB proteins. Thus, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that GUY1 and gYG2/YOB may be evolutionarily related. Regardless, it is unlikely that <i>Guy1</i> and <i>gYG2/YOB</i> are complete functional orthologs because <i>Guy1</i> is only expressed in the early embryos in <i>An. stephensi</i> (tapering off at 8\u201312\u2009hr after egg laying, <a href=\"#bib14\">Criscione et al., 2013</a>) while <i>gYG2/YOB</i> is expressed in the early embryos as well as in later developmental stages in <i>An. gambiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hall et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Krzywinska et al., 2016</a>). Our hypothesis is that <i>Guy1</i> is the initial or primary signal which triggers a cascade of events downstream. This is analogous to the early <i>Sex-lethal</i> gene product (SXL<sub>e</sub>) in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib29\">Herpin and Schartl, 2015</a>]), which is only produced during the early embryonic stage. This transient primary signal, SXL<sub>e</sub>, is sufficient to trigger the female-specific cascade of events that are then maintained by downstream factors such as the late SXL protein throughout development. The transient expression of <i>Guy1</i> suggests that it may function as a trigger or initiating signal, but not as a gene that maintains sexual identity. If additional Y genes are indeed required for either initiating or maintaining sex determination in <i>An. stephensi</i>, ectopic expression of <i>Guy1</i> alone may not be sufficient to change <i>dsx</i> splicing in female cells/embryos due to the lack of Y chromosome. The transient and early embryonic expression of <i>Guy1</i> also made it difficult to knockdown <i>Guy1</i> simply because there is not enough time for RNAi to work in the early embryos. However, further characterization of other Y genes in <i>An. stephensi</i> may enable the experimental demonstration of potential <i>Guy1</i> targets, which could lead to the elucidation of the <i>Guy1</i>-dependent developmental pathway in the early embryos."

Recent work showed that ectopic expression of an <i>M</i> factor <i>Nix</i> in <i>Ae. aegypti</i> initiated male development in genetic females (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hall et al., 2015</a>) and embryonic injection of in vitro synthesized <i>gYG2/YOB</i> mRMA conferred female-specific lethality in <i>An. gambiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krzywinska et al., 2016</a>). However, the stability and penetrance of the phenotypes conferred by the <i>Nix</i> or <i>gYG2/YOB</i> transgenes remain to be determined as <i>Nix</i> or <i>gYG2/YOB</i> transgenic lines have yet to be reported (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hall et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Krzywinska et al., 2016</a>). Here, we have proved in principle that sustained sex ratio manipulation can be achieved using a Y chromosome gene with high penetrance. Furthermore, males that carry the <i>Guy1</i> transgene are more competitive in overall reproductive output than their non-transgenic male siblings under laboratory conditions. Future studies based on analysis of progeny of individual females mated with transgenic and wildtype males will give insight regarding the mating competitiveness of the transgenic individuals. Competitive assays performed in semi-field or field conditions are needed to determine whether ectopic expression of <i>Guy1</i> truly makes the males reproductively more competitive than wild type mosquitoes. Nonetheless, data presented in this study suggest that the <i>Guy1</i> transgene shows no obvious detrimental effects in males and may be developed as a new method to generate male-only mosquitoes for release."

The <i>Guy1</i> transgenic lines offer several attractive features in this regard. With regard to sex separation, 100% female lethality is ideal for both effectiveness and ethical considerations of not accidentally releasing females. In addition, released females can compete with wild-type females to mate with the released males simply due to their presence and even through assortative mating. Thus, the complete penetrance of the male-only phenotype, as seen in every <i>Guy1</i> transgenic line over many generations, with the exception of the negative controls, is a highly attractive feature when developing a novel genetic sex-separation approach based on <i>Guy1</i>. The\u00a0current mass production of male mosquitoes relies on physical means of sex separation, which is labor-intensive, expensive, and not 100% accurate ([<a href=\"#bib2\">Alphey, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gilles et al., 2014</a>]). Transgenic lines that express fluorescent markers in a sex-specific pattern have been developed to allow machine-based sorting of the sexes (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib11\">Catteruccia et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Marois et al., 2012</a>]). However, such an approach is expensive with a relatively low throughput (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gilles et al., 2014</a>). Another positive feature of the <i>Guy1</i> lines is the embryonic or early larvae lethality, which negates the need to rear female larvae altogether. The <i>Guy1</i> transgenic lines also offer a few important advantages to strategies for reducing mosquito populations and disease transmission. The observed 100% female lethality will result in bias towards the non-biting males in multiple generations, which is theoretically much more efficient than classic sterile insect techniques in achieving population reduction and disease control ([<a href=\"#bib53\">Thomas et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schliekelman et al., 2005</a>]). An exciting report recently showed that an artificial sex ratio distortion system based on the shredding of the <i>An. gambiae</i> X chromosome produced &gt;95% male offspring (<a href=\"#bib19\">Galizi et al., 2014</a>). The 100% female lethality described here was accomplished by simply expressing the endogenous <i>Guy1</i> gene from the autosome. Thus, the <i>Guy1</i>-based genetic strategy involves minimal genetic manipulation."

Alternatively, the <i>Guy1</i> transgene may be linked to recently developed CRISPR/cas9-based gene drives (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gantz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hammond et al., 2016</a>) for rapid spread of this female-lethal gene over multiple generations. This may represent an effective yet self-limiting strategy to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases because the spread of <i>Guy1</i> could lead to severe reduction or local extinction of <i>An. stephensi</i> populations due to the lack of females (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman and Tu, 2016</a>). Research on <i>Guy1</i> has shown great promise for genetic control of mosquito-borne infectious diseases and revealed the complex and sex-specific effect of a Y gene during mosquito embryonic development. The unexplored mosquito Y chromosome may in fact turn out to be a gold mine for intriguing stories about sexual dimorphism and promising leads for new ways to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases."

The <i>nGuy1</i> plasmid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) contained the native <i>Guy1</i> gene, which included the full length <i>Guy1</i> cDNA sequence (5\u2019 UTR, CDS and 3\u2019 UTR) and the previously tested <i>Guy1</i> native promoter (<a href=\"#bib14\">Criscione et al., 2013</a>). The native <i>Guy1</i> gene was PCR amplified using genomic DNA from adult male <i>An. stephensi</i> as a template and primers are shown in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>. A second round of PCR was performed to adapt AscI and PacI sites to clone into the above mentioned donor plasmid backbone. The <i>nGuy1</i> plasmid and all other plasmids constructed in this study were verified by Sanger sequencing at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (VBI) on the Virginia Tech campus. The <i>Guy1m</i> plasmid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) is identical to <i>nGuy1</i> except for a point mutation that changed the start codon ATG to AAG.

Males that were DsRed positive and DsRed negative (siblings) were reared separately in pans with equal larval density. Two days after emerging, twenty transgenic males and twenty non-transgenic males were placed in a 44 oz Coke cup (44TDCB) together. Ten wild type virgin females (approximately three days post pupal emergence) were introduced and allowed to mate for twenty-four hours with the mixed males. The females were then blood fed for a minimum of thirty minutes and inspected for feeding. Seventy-two hrs post blood feeding, eggs were collected from these females for 24\u2009hrs. The subsequent F3 progeny were screened for DsRed and sexed at the L3 larval stage. Biological triplicates were performed for these sets of experiments. The expected results for transgenic males, non-transgenic females, and non-transgenic males were 1/7, 3/7, and 3/7, respectively (see note of <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> for detailed explanations). It has already been experimentally determined that transgenic females do not survive to the L3 stage and are, thus, not calculated into the expected progeny ratios."

The authors elegantly confirm the specificity of <i>Guy1</i>-induced female lethality using control lines where this gene is mutated. The results clearly show that <i>Guy1</i> may be used to generate male-only populations for transgenic releases, once a system for conditional expression is developed and optimized. Moreover, they are consistent with a role for <i>Guy1</i> as a male determining factor in these mosquitoes, although they don't prove it. The authors suggest dosage compensation as a possible mechanism for the observed female lethality but they don't test this hypothesis. This study therefore is a promising first step towards the generation of a potential new tool for mosquito control and towards the elucidation of the sex determination pathway in this <i>Anopheles</i> species, although neither is fully accomplished."

Mating competitiveness is better measured by characterizing the progeny of each individual female rather than counting bulk numbers. How many females mated in 24 hours? And of these, how many mated to wild type versus transgenic males? What was the fecundity and fertility of the two groups? The 'wild type' males chosen in the experiments are non-transgenic <i>Guy1</i> siblings: what's the standard mating rate, fecundity and fertility of females mated to these males? In their current format I do not think those experiments unequivocally show that <i>Guy1</i> transgenics are more competitive than wild type males. If confirmed, it would be great if the authors could speculate on how <i>Guy1</i> may increase mating competitiveness, which in some of the competition experiments appears incredibly high."

We have previously attempted to perform RT-PCR and qRT-PCR on the newly hatched wildtype first instar larvae. However, we could not detect any sex-specific <i>dsx</i> transcripts at the L1 instar stage. Therefore, it has not been technically possible to perform the experiment suggested by the reviewer, possibly due to low abundance or lack of sex-specific expression of <i>dsx</i> in most cells of the newly hatched larvae. Even if sex-specific <i>dsx</i> splicing could be detected in wildtype early first instar, there is a more fundamental challenge. Because <i>Guy1</i> is only transiently expressed in the early embryos in <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>, it cannot function as a gene that maintains sexual identity. This is different from the situation in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, where <i>gYG2/YOB</i> is expressed throughout development. Ectopic expression of <i>Guy1</i> alone in XX embryos or cells may not be sufficient to change <i>dsx</i> splicing if additional Y factors are required. 2) In XY individuals, because <i>Guy1</i> is expressed transiently in the early embryo (tapering off at 8hours after egg laying), it has been difficult to knock it down simply because there is not enough time for RNAi to work in the early embryo. We are developing CRISPR/cas9-based knockout in <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>. However, <i>Guy1</i> knockout may be lethal to males. To determine the mechanism of <i>Guy1</i> function, we are in the process of identifying potential <i>Guy1</i> targets, which will be informative but beyond the scope of this manuscript."

In the earlier summary statement, the reviewer identified key findings that are consistent with <i>Guy1</i> being a candidate for a male-determining factor, namely its Y-linkage, early embryonic expression, and its ectopic expression causing female-specific lethality (a phenomena shared with known master regulators of sex-determination in other species). We will also add two points here: 1) we have also shown, using <i>Guy1</i> transgenic lines, that <i>Guy1</i> transcription from its native promoter does not require any other factors from the Y chromosome. Thus, <i>Guy1</i> is an initial or primary signal from the Y chromosome. Please note that we are not saying that this is the proof for <i>Guy1</i> being the initiating male-determining factor. We are saying that this is evidence that <i>Guy1</i> is a primary signal, not a secondary signal from the Y chromosome. 2) GUY1 is of the same length as the recently reported M factor in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> gYG2/YOB (56 aa) and shares similar secondary structure with gYG2/YOB. Although there is no significant primary sequence similarity between GUY1 and gYG2/YOB over the whole sequence, four out of the first five amino acid residues are identical between these two proteins. We are not at all claiming that the two proteins share a common origin. But neither can we rule out this possibility because Y chromosome genes tend to evolve rapidly and similarities between very small proteins may not be obvious. We agree with the reviewer that additional evidence is needed to conclude that <i>Guy1</i> is the male-determining factor. However, taken all existing data together, we think it is appropriate to say that <i>Guy1</i> is a strong candidate for an M factor in <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>."
