We developed a visual accumulation of evidence task designed to quantify sources of noise and to be performed during voluntary head restraint, enabling cellular resolution imaging in future studies. Rats accumulated discrete numbers of flashes presented to the left and right visual hemifields and indicated the side that had the greater number of flashes. Using a signal-detection theory-based model, we found that the standard deviation in their internal estimate of flash number scaled linearly with the number of flashes. This indicates a major source of noise that, surprisingly, is not consistent with the widely used 'drift-diffusion modeling' (DDM) approach but is instead closely related to proposed models of numerical cognition and counting. We speculate that this form of noise could be important in accumulation of evidence tasks generally."

We developed a visual accumulation of evidence task designed to quantify sources of noise and to be performed during voluntary head restraint, enabling cellular resolution imaging in future studies. Rats accumulated discrete numbers of flashes presented to the left and right visual hemifields and indicated the side that had the greater number of flashes. Using a signal-detection theory-based model, we found that the standard deviation in their internal estimate of flash number scaled linearly with the number of flashes. This indicates a major source of noise that, surprisingly, is not consistent with the widely used 'drift-diffusion modeling' (DDM) approach but is instead closely related to proposed models of numerical cognition and counting. We speculate that this form of noise could be important in accumulation of evidence tasks generally."

Determining the sources of this variability could provide insight into the neural mechanisms of decision-making and produce more accurate predictions of behavior. It has been proposed that behavioral variability is caused in part by noise accruing during the process of evidence accumulation. This noise may have a variety of origins depending on the behavioral task. It can be inherent in the natural world, produced by the signal detection limits of sensory organs themselves (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barlow and Levick, 1969</a>), or it may reflect the variability of neural responses in the brain at different stages of processing. Previous studies have attempted to trace the sources of noise using a combination of behavioral and neurophysiological approaches."

                        "text": "At the behavioral level, many models of the evidence accumulation process are known as \u2018drift-diffusion\u2019 models (DDMs), because a major component of the noise is modeled as diffusion noise in the accumulator, i.e., noise that is independent for each time point (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Smith and Ratcliff, 2004</a>, but see <a href=\"#bib47\">Zariwala et al., 2013</a>). A recent study by Brunton and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brunton et al., 2013</a>) developed an accumulation of evidence task, which they modeled with a DDM-like process, to isolate different sources of noise. In their task, evidence was delivered in randomly timed but precisely known pulses: two randomly generated streams of discrete auditory clicks were presented from left and right speakers, and subjects (rats and humans) were trained to indicate the side with the greater number of clicks. The precise timing of the stimuli combined with large numbers of behavioral trials enabled fitting of a detailed and statistically powerful behavioral model. The results suggested that in most subjects the diffusion noise in the accumulator was essentially zero (noiseless), and the behavioral variability was best explained by noise that was added with each pulse of evidence. However, it was assumed that each pulse introduced independent noise. This implied that although time-locked to the stimulus, the noise associated with the stimulus was diffusion-like, and the standard deviation of the total stimulus-induced noise scaled as the square root of the number of pulses. Overall, the model was qualitatively consistent with the widely-assumed diffusion-like noise in the evidence accumulation process. However, similar to other reports, diffusion-like noise alone was unable to fully predict behavioral variability, and specifically failed to account for errors on the easiest trials. Following common practice, <a href=\"#bib7\">Brunton et al. (2013)</a> included an additional noise parameter, termed lapse rate, which described variability that did not depend on the stimulus or trial duration. The need for the lapse rate term suggests the existence of additional sources of noise that are not diffusion-like."

First, rats could perform the task during voluntary head-restraint (<a href=\"#bib18\">Girman, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kampff et al., 2010</a>, SFN, abstract), allowing for the potential of cellular resolution imaging (<a href=\"#bib39\">Scott et al., 2013</a>) and perturbation in future studies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rickgauer et al., 2014</a>). Second, the sensory stimuli were designed to attempt to isolate internally generated noise by minimizing noise inherited from the stimulus. In our task, rats were presented with two series of brief (10 ms), pseudorandomly timed LED flashes to the left and right visual hemifields. Following the form of\u00a0the <a href=\"#bib7\">Brunton et al. (2013)</a> task, the side with the greater total number of flashes indicated the location of a water reward. However, whereas the acoustics of the behavior chamber could distort localization of auditory stimuli, here our visual stimuli were presented from well-separated LEDs positioned to the left and right visual hemifields, suggesting that the rats would have no difficulty distinguishing the left versus right origin of each flash. Additionally, low numbers of flashes were presented in well-separated time bins."

We implemented a signal detection theory-based model to evaluate the assumption that noise in the accumulator value was diffusion-like, i.e. that noise was independent for each flash and the noise (standard deviation) of the accumulator value scaled as the square root of the number of flashes. The signal detection theory-based model was designed to find the scaling relationship between noise in the accumulator value and number of flashes that best described the data. Surprisingly, model fits revealed that the noise in the subjects\u2019 numerical estimates scaled linearly with the number of flashes presented, not as the square root. This relationship, called scalar variability, has previously been observed in tasks that require subjects to estimate the duration of a stimulus (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gibbon, 1977</a>) or count the number of stimuli (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gallistel and Gelman, 2000</a>). Moreover, a behavioral model implementing scalar variability predicted imperfect behavioral performance on the easiest trials, without the need for a non-zero \u2018lapse rate\u2019 parameter. Linear scaling of the standard deviation of the noise with the number of flashes reveals a source of noise that does not treat individual pulses independently. Therefore, the noise is not diffusion-like; unlike a lapse rate it depends on total number of evidence pulses; and it is introduced after single-flash sensory processing. We suggest that taking into account this form of noise will be a critical factor for understanding variability in decision-making behaviors."

Ideally, this approach would include recordings from multiple neurons across brain regions and precise neural circuit manipulations. To this end, we developed a version of our task that rats could perform during voluntary head restraint. Voluntary head restraint was developed as an alternative to forced head restraint in which the initiation and termination of the restraint period are under the control of the animal (<a href=\"#bib18\">Girman, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">1985</a>; A.R. Kampff et al., 2010, SFN, abstract). Recently we reported that rats can be trained to perform voluntary head restraint in a high-throughput semi-automated behavioral facility and described a voluntary head restraint system that provides the stability needed for <i>in vivo</i> cellular resolution imaging (<a href=\"#bib39\">Scott et al., 2013</a>). Here we show that performance of head restrained rats was essentially identical to the performance of rats trained on the unrestrained version of the task. These results demonstrate that rats can perform complex cognitive behaviors during voluntary head restraint and provide a platform for characterizing noise during decision-making across multiple brain regions."

The procedural code used for training can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://brodylab.org/code/flash-code\">http://brodylab.org/code/flash-code</a>. Rats progressed through the training stages in 3500 trials. Fully trained rats performed a combined 525,073 trials at 91% for the easiest trials and 70% correct overall.

                                "text": "Accumulation of evidence involves two processes: maintaining a memory of the evidence and adding new evidence to that memory. To assess whether noise (and thus behavioral variability) was more closely associated with the memory of the accumulator or with incoming sensory evidence, we initially fit the Brunton et al. model to our visual task data. This produced results consistent with those found for Brunton et al.\u2019s auditory task, including near-zero estimates of accumulator memory noise (i.e., a predominant role for incoming sensory evidence noise), and long accumulation time constants (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, further analysis described below led us to question Brunton et al.\u2019s assumption of independent noise across pulses of sensory evidence. We therefore took a model-free approach to estimate whether noise was more closely associated with the memory of the accumulator or with incoming sensory evidence. When trial duration and flash difference were held constant, errors increased with total number of flashes presented, suggesting that noise increased with each flash (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Next, we sought to directly compare the effects of flashes and time on behavioral performance (% correct). First, looking across trials with identical differences in flash number (fixed |#R-#L| = \u0394F) but with varying total flash number\u00a0(#R+#L=\u03a3F)\u00a0, we calculated the fraction of correct responses as a function of \u03a3F, relative to the average performance (\u0394 Performance; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). With the difference in flashes \u0394F thus controlled for, we found that trials with greater numbers of flashes showed a substantial decrease in performance. Linear regression suggested that each additional flash decreased performance by 1.14% (+/-0.1%). With an average of 4 flashes presented per second, increasing total flashes at a fixed flash difference thus produced an average decrement in performance of 4.56% per second. Then, to estimate the effect of time on performance, we calculated \u0394 performance across trials with both identical flash differences (\u0394F) and identical total flash number\u00a0\u03a3F), but with different overall trial duration. This analysis, which controls for the number of flashes, revealed that the purely time-dependent decrement in performance was only 0.037% (+/-. 77%) for each second of trial duration. These results suggest that error rates depend far more strongly on the number of flashes than on trial duration. We found this both for the group data of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and for individual rats as well (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

(2013)</a> used here to compare the contribution of flash- and time-associated noise to behavioral variability. At each moment in time the model represents the accumulated evidence as a decision variable, <i>a</i>(<i>t</i>)(black line). Colored arrows indicate the timing of left (blue) and right (red) flashes. \u03c3<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup> parameterizes the noise added with each flash, \u03c3<sub>a</sub><sup>2</sup> parameterizes the noise added at each time point, \u03c4 (or 1/\u03bb) parameterizes the memory time constant of <i>a(<i>t</i>)</i>. \u03bb&lt;0 suggests that the memory decays to <i>a</i> = 0 with time, \u03bb&gt;0 suggests that the magnitude of <i>a(<i>t</i>)</i> increases over time. <i>B</i> parameterizes sticky bounds: if <i>a(<i>t</i>)</i> ever reaches +/-<i>B,</i> integration stops and the animal is committed to that decision (go right/go left, respectively). There are a few other terms in the model that are not represented in the schematic. A bias term represents an offset of <i>a(t)</i> at the beginning of each trial. A lapse rate parameterizes the percent of trials on which the animal behaves randomly. \u03c6 and \u03c4<sub>\u03c6</sub> parameterize sensory adaptation dynamics. After a flash, \u03c6 is a constant that scales the effect of the flash; it recovers to an unadapted/facilitated magnitude with time constant \u03c4<sub>\u03c6</sub>. \u03c6 &gt;1 indicates that successive flashes facilitate; \u03c6 &lt;1 indicates that they depress. Fits to those parameters are not shown here, because we found that the inter-flash-intervals presented here were sufficiently long to minimize any adaptation/facilitation effects of subsequent flashes. Light gray lines indicate alternative runs of the model on the same trial. (B)\u00a0Model fits of flash-associated noise (\u03c3<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>; blue circles) and noise associated with time (\u03c3<sub>a</sub><sup>2</sup>; red circles). To evaluate these parameters in comparable units, \u03c3<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup> was divided by the average number of flashes per second for each rat. For each subject, noise associated with time (\u03c3<sub>a</sub><sup>2</sup>) is close to zero, whereas noise correlated with flashes (\u03c3<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>) is predominant, consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brunton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hanks et al., 2015</a>). (C) The drift in the accumulator\u2019s memory is parameterized by \u03bb. A leaky integrator would have negative values of \u03bb, an impulsive integrator would have positive values. The time constant of the integrator, \u03c4, is 1/\u03bb. For many, but not all, of the rats, the time constant is close to or greater than 2 s ( \u03bb &lt;= 0.5). (D)\u00a0The bound value for all except two rats is larger than the maximum number of flashes (on one side) that each rat experienced. This suggests that rats accumulated/used all of the flashes to inform their decision. (E)\u00a0The bias term for the each rat.

In the scalar variability model, which has been used to describe both time estimation and counting, the standard deviation of the estimate shows a linear relationship with the quantity represented. The subitizing model predicts that the numerical representation of the first few numbers, up to three or four, is essentially noiseless, and after five its standard deviation grows linearly with the number of flashes. Subitizing has been proposed in tasks in which stimuli are presented simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib44\">Trick and Pylyshyn, 1994</a>) and also sequentially (<a href=\"#bib9\">Camos and Tillmann, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">von Glasersfeld, 1982</a>)."

In this approach, the subjects\u2019 estimate of the number of flashes on one side is modeled as a random variable drawn from a Gaussian distribution.

Supporting scalar variability, both the data and best-fit signal detection theory-based model predictions exhibited roughly constant performance for trials with fixed ratios of flashes (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Interestingly, however, behavior deviated from scalar variability, especially for trials with very low number of flashes. For these trials, there was an improvement in performance with additional flashes, even though the ratio of flashes was fixed (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), which is not predicted by pure scalar variability. Nevertheless, this deviation from scalar variability was well predicted by the model parameters of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>.

We accounted for adaptation effects, which are prominent in the auditory task due to high click rates, and computed the \u2018effective\u2019 number of clicks presented after implementing the adaptation dynamics described in <a href=\"#equ7\">Equation (6)</a> (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). On trials in which this approach yielded fractional number of clicks, we rounded the effective click number (after adaptation) to the nearest integer. This kept the number of parameters in the auditory task model roughly equal to the number in the model for the visual task.

Notably, perfect scalar variability (<math id=\"inf23\"><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>\u00a0</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>n</mi></math>\u00a0without the constant <math id=\"inf24\"><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math>) would predict no improvement as a function of time for a fixed click ratio, yet such an improvement is clearly seen in the clicks data (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>).

Alternatively, it is possible that rats could be treating each flash as a distinct event, independent of its duration, and integrating the number of flashes. To test which strategy the rats used, we performed an additional experiment in which we trained a second cohort of rats (n=7) on a new version of the task. As before, rats were rewarded for orienting to the side with the greater number of flashes, but in this version the durations of each flash and inter-flash interval were randomly jittered (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Flash duration was drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 10\u00a0ms and standard deviation of 1.5\u00a0ms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Because LED duration is correlated with number of flashes on most trials, it is difficult to evaluate whether animals use flash duration or flash number on most trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). However, on trials in which there was no difference in the number of flashes (\u0394flashes = 0), the jittering of flash duration led to the generation of some trials with a difference in the duration presented from the right or left LEDs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Since, for example, 20\u00a0ms of light is the equivalent of a difference of two flashes, we reasoned that on these trials, if the subjects were integrating light\u00a0duration, they would be more likely to orient to the side with longer LED durations, and a regression line fit to the data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> should have a positive slope. Conversely, if they were integrating discrete flash number, they should not exhibit a preference to the side with longer flash duration, and a regression line fit to the data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> should have a slope of zero. Consistent with integrating flash number, we found that on trials with 0 \u0394flashes, rats did not exhibit a preference for the side with longer flash durations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). These results indicate that the rats were accumulating the number of flashes, not their total duration."

To assess whether the memory of reward location on previous trials biased the subjects\u2019 decisions on future trials, we identified trials following a reward and compared behavioral performance depending on whether the reward had been delivered to the left or right (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

The effect of this bias was modest but significant, and was constant across a range of numerical flash differences, producing a vertical shift in the psychometric function (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

Subjects were presented with two simultaneous trains of randomly timed flashes, one train on their left, and the other on their right, and were rewarded for orienting towards the side with the greater total number of flashes. Behavioral analyses, including reverse correlation, indicated that rats used flashes presented throughout the entire trial to guide their decision, consistent with a strategy of accumulating evidence (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We used a signal detection theory framework to estimate the noise associated with each pulse of evidence (flash). This analysis showed that noise (standard deviation) in the subjects\u2019 numerical estimates scaled linearly with the number of flashes presented, indicating that noise per flash is not independent across flashes. We find that noise is also independent of total stimulus duration, and is perhaps added to the decision variable after the accumulation process. Our behavioral modeling further suggests the existence of two separate accumulators in this binary decision task (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The noise scaling we found is similar to scalar variability described in the numerical cognition literature, and appears to be the major source of variability in our subjects\u2019 behavior. Yet it is not diffusion-like and is therefore not well-described by the majority of current \u2018drift-diffusion modeling\u2019 (DDM) approaches for accumulation of evidence in decision-making. Incorporating this scalar variability noise will likely be critical for understanding variability in decision-making behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that rats can be trained to perform this task during voluntary head restraint, which opens up new experimental avenues for uncovering the circuit mechanisms that generate behavioral variability during decision-making."

The technique is typically employed in behavioral experiments to facilitate reliable presentation of sensory stimuli to the head or face and precisely control the subjects\u2019 movements, and in neurophysiological experiments to minimize motion between the brain and recording apparatus. However, it can take some species, notably rats and primates, weeks to acclimate to forced head restraint. Moreover forced head restraint requires skilled experimenter intervention and is difficult to incorporate into automated training procedures. Voluntary head restraint has been proposed to reduce the stress normally associated with forced head restraint and facilitate training on sophisticated behavioral tasks (<a href=\"#bib39\">Scott et al., 2013</a>). Here, we show that rats are able to perform a complex cognitive task, involving both numerical representation and integration of evidence, while voluntarily head-restrained. This provides a foundation for identifying and characterizing the neural circuit mechanisms of accumulation of evidence and numerical representation in future studies using <i>in vivo</i> cellular resolution imaging and perturbation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rickgauer et al., 2014</a>)."

However, in the visual accumulation of evidence task, the rewarded side is assigned independently on each trial, so trial history adds noise to the decision process. The influence of trial history on subsequent decisions has been observed in a number of other studies, suggesting that it is a general source of behavioral variability that should be incorporated into accumulation of evidence models (<a href=\"#bib8\">Busse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gold et al., 2008</a>)."

This type of noise scaling, called scalar variability, was consistent across the range of stimuli presented (1-15 flashes, with minor deviations at the lowest number of flashes) suggesting that the subjects did not use a subitizing approach, i.e., they did not use rapid accurate counting for numbers less than five. We applied our analysis to a closely related previous auditory task that, as in our current visual task, also delivered sensory evidence in discrete pulses (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brunton et al., 2013</a>). We found that our conclusions also applied to the auditory data, with the standard deviation of the noise after <i>N</i> flashes well-described by \u03c3<i><sub>n</sub></i>= <math id=\"inf35\"><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>n</mi></math>. Our observation that performance in the auditory task improves with increased integration times is qualitatively consistent with data from tasks in which evidence is delivered in a continuous stream rather than in discrete pulses. This leads us to suggest that scalar variability should be an important consideration in the analysis of data from continuous tasks. But whether or not scalar variability is the dominant form of noise in continuous stream tasks, as it was in the pulsatile tasks analyzed here, remains to be determined."

However, an important distinction should be made between quantitative models of behavior and mechanistic models of the underlying neural processes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marr, 1982</a>). Our results do not suggest an underlying neural mechanism, however they do place important constraints on such mechanistic models. One such constraint is scalar variability, which has been observed in a wide variety of tasks requiring animals to estimate magnitudes (such as time or number\u00a0<a href=\"#bib16\">Gallistel and Gelman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gibbon, 1977</a>). Two possible neural mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. The first is that the brain represents magnitude on a logarithmic scale with constant noise (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fechner, 1860</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dehaene and Changeux, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Meck and Church, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nieder and Dehaene, 2009</a>). Neurophysiological recordings, particularly in sensory systems, have provided support for this mechanism. For example, neurons in the rodent somatosensory cortex exhibit firing rates that scale logarithmically with frequency of tactile stimulation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kleinfeld et al., 2006</a>). In addition, neurons in primate parietal cortex appear to encode numerosity on a nonlinear scale (power law or logarithmic; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nieder and Miller, 2003</a>). The second possibility is that the brain represents magnitude on a linear scale with noise that is proportional to the magnitude. The results described here did not allow us to differentiate between these two models, and indeed, both models make identical psychophysical predictions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dehaene, 2001</a>). However, how they would be instantiated in the brain is quite different. For the logarithmic case, the signal diminishes with the quantity being represented, but noise added at each time point is independent. For the linear case, the signal is constant (implying near perfect summation of signals), but noise scales linearly with the magnitude being estimated."

In some systems, however, noise is thought to serve an important functional role. For example it has been proposed that random fluctuations in neuronal membrane potential contributes to contrast invariance in the visual system (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2000</a>). Moreover, during motor learning, noise is actively introduced into highly reliable systems to create the behavioral variability required for trial and error learning (<a href=\"#bib35\">Olveczky et al., 2005</a>). An interesting question is whether noise also facilitates learning in perceptual tasks. One potential function of noise in the estimate of flash number is that it could allow animals, which have been trained on a reduced stimulus set, to generalize, and perform correctly on trials with numbers of flashes they have never encountered. For example, if rats were only trained on trials with 5 and 6 flashes, because of the variability of their estimate of 5 and 6 flashes, on a portion of those trials they will have effectively perceived 7 and 8 flashes, and could learn the correct response to those trials by trial and error. Thus noise may allow the observer to experience a larger range of stimuli than they actually encountered, enabling generalization."

The major source of noise displayed \u2018scalar variability<b>\u2019</b> in the sense that its standard deviation scaled linearly with the number of pulses of evidence. This observation is inconsistent with the assumption made by most previous models of accumulation for decision-making, namely that the primary noise source is diffusion-like, added to the accumulator independent of time or accumulator value. Our observation is instead consistent with previous models of numerical cognition, and suggests that evidence accumulation and numerical cognition may be subserved by similar or related circuits and neural mechanisms. We speculate that noise that obeys scalar variability could be an important component in models of accumulation of decision-making evidence generally. Finally, the observation that voluntarily head-restrained rats exhibit similar behavioral performance to unrestrained rats, and can be trained to perform complex decision-making tasks, suggests the possibility of using cellular resolution optical imaging and perturbation technologies to characterize the neural substrates of cognition."

Unrestrained rats experienced up to 15 bins, whereas head-fixed rats experienced up to 6 bins. For a given trial, each of the two LEDs had a fixed generative probability of producing a flash in each bin. In the final training stage for the unrestrained rats, the generative probabilities for the high-probability LED and low-probability LED ranged\u00a0from\u00a070-80% and 20-30%, respectively. For restrained rats, the generative probabilities were 70% and 30%. However, the rats were rewarded based on the number of flashes that were actually presented, not on the underlying generative probabilities. In other words, in the rare event that the LED designated \u2018high-probability\u2019 happened to produce fewer flashes than the LED designated \u2018low-probability\u2019, the animal was rewarded for orienting to the side that had more flashes. The flashes were 10\u00a0ms in duration (except for an experimental group in which the flash durations were jittered; see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), and they occurred in the first 10\u00a0ms of each cue bin. For the unrestrained rats, the inter-flash intervals ranged from 240\u00a0ms (two flashes in subsequent bins) to 3.45 s (two flashes separated by 13 bins; see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For the head-fixed rats, the inter-flash intervals ranged from 240\u00a0ms to 1.24 s. In a subset of experiments, inter-flash intervals and flash durations were jittered. In these experiments, flash durations were drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 10 ms, and standard deviation of 1.5 ms. Inter-flash intervals were drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 250 ms and standard deviation of either 25 or 50 ms."

First, for each model, we computed a distribution of bootstrapped r<sup>2</sup> values by resampling the behavioral trials with replacement, performing the fitting procedure, and computing the r<sup>2</sup> value, on 1000 iterations. For pairwise comparisons, (for example, between the scalar variability (SV) and linear variance (LV) models in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), the null hypothesis was that the r<sup>2</sup> values for each distribution derive from a common distribution. To test this hypothesis, we combined the bootstrapped r<sup>2</sup> values from the SV and LV models into a single distribution, and from that combined distribution, created two arbitrary distributions of fake SV and LV r<sup>2</sup> values, and computed the average of those arbitrary distributions. We repeated this procedure for many (100, 1000, and 10000) iterations to compute a distribution of arbitrary SV and LV r<sup>2</sup> values and consequently, the difference of those arbitrary distributions, which represents the null hypothesis. We treated the area under the null distribution corresponding to the difference between the true SV and LV r<sup>2</sup> distributions as the p-value. This procedure yielded identical results with 100, 1000, and 10000 permutations. It was performed for the model comparisons in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, as well as for evaluation of the SV vs. LV models for the auditory (clicks) data."

One hundred surrogate datasets were created by selecting behavioral trials at random with replacement from the original dataset. The signal detection theory-based model was then fit to each surrogate dataset, and the log likelihood for the best-fit parameters was recorded. This gave us a distribution of log likelihoods for each version of the model. We then performed the nonparametric permutation test described above on the distributions of log likelihoods to make pairwise comparisons between the best-fit model and all other models."

In particular, the reviewers thought that the use of a decision paradigm in which the exact information provided to an animal on each trial can be precisely controlled is a powerful means to study the mechanisms underlying decision making. This property indeed allowed the authors to analyze the decision-making process in a greater detail. The authors conclude that the standard deviation (SD) of the internal estimates grows linearly with the number of flashes (i.e. features Weber scaling), which violates the linear scaling in variance (rather than SD) commonly assumed by evidence accumulation models (including the one used in Brunton et al. [2013]). On the other hand, the reviewers raised some important issues that the authors should address before publication in <i>eLife</i>."

The question of which specific penalization to use for comparing non-nested models with different parameters (AIC, BIC, DIC, \u201cempirical bayes\u201d etc) is a subject of ongoing debate within the machine learning literature. The reviewers\u2019 comment prompted us to perform a new analysis, which we feel is far simpler and does not suffer from the complications of statistical model comparison for non-nested models. We simplified our models so that all of the 8 model variants that we compare have exactly the same number of parameters (only 2), with similar structures for the two parameters across all the 8 models. This approach made comparison across models much more straightforward, and allowed us to compare log likelihoods directly. The results of this new comparison are described in our Results section and in our revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. We also include a new figure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that compares the different models for each individual animal."

It is worth noting that if a pulse created a short-lasting non- zero drift (e.g., on the order of tens of milliseconds), our results would remain essentially the same, because all analyses and results depend on the integrated effect of each pulse. The important question is thus with respect to long-lasting non-zero drift."

Thus we would expect decisions to be biased toward the side with the greatest cumulative post-pulse time. To examine whether our assumption of zero drift during inter-pulse intervals was reasonable, we implemented a regression model with two parameters: cumulative post-pulse interval duration and difference in flash number (plus a third parameters, for a constant term). Long-lasting post-pulse drift would produce a significant positive regression weight for the cumulative post-pulse duration. Instead, the model revealed that the rats\u2019 choices were better explained by differences in flash number on each trial. More specifically, the regression coefficient for the difference in flash number was. 25 +/- .0038, compared to -.06 +/- .0036 for cumulative post-pulse interval duration (and. 02 +/- .0012 for the bias/constant term). We concluded that nonzero drift during the inter-pulse intervals did not appreciably contribute to the rats\u2019 behavior."

[To clarify: the distribution of bootstrapped R2 values were obtained by resampling from the behavioral trials with replacement, performing the fitting procedure, and computing the R2 value, on 1000 iterations.] To test the null hypothesis, we combined the bootstrapped R2 values from the SV and LV models into a single distribution, and from that combined distribution, created two arbitrary distributions of fake SV and LV R2 values, and computed the average of those arbitrary distributions. We repeated this procedure for many iterations to compute a distribution of arbitrary SV and LV R2 values and consequently, the difference of those arbitrary distributions, which represents the null hypothesis. The area of the null distribution corresponding to the difference between the true SV and LV R2 distributions is the p-value. As pointed out above, the procedure yielded identical results with 100, 1000, and 10000 permutations. It was performed for the model comparisons in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, as well as for evaluation of the SV vs. LV models for the auditory (clicks) data.
