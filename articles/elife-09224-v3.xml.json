Here, we use a single-molecule approach to monitor SpoIIIE translocation when challenged with neutral-backbone DNA and non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs. We show that SpoIIIE makes multiple essential contacts with phosphates on the 5'\u21923' strand in the direction of translocation. Using DNA constructs with two neutral-backbone segments separated by a single charged base pair, we deduce that SpoIIIE\u2019s step size is 2 bp. Finally, experiments with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs suggest that SpoIIIE can operate with non-consecutive inactive subunits. We propose a two-subunit escort translocation mechanism that is strict enough to enable SpoIIIE to track one DNA strand, yet sufficiently compliant to permit the motor to bypass inactive subunits without arrest. We speculate that such a flexible mechanism arose for motors that, like SpoIIIE, constitute functional bottlenecks where the inactivation of even a single motor can be lethal for the cell."

Here, we use a single-molecule approach to monitor SpoIIIE translocation when challenged with neutral-backbone DNA and non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs. We show that SpoIIIE makes multiple essential contacts with phosphates on the 5'\u21923' strand in the direction of translocation. Using DNA constructs with two neutral-backbone segments separated by a single charged base pair, we deduce that SpoIIIE\u2019s step size is 2 bp. Finally, experiments with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs suggest that SpoIIIE can operate with non-consecutive inactive subunits. We propose a two-subunit escort translocation mechanism that is strict enough to enable SpoIIIE to track one DNA strand, yet sufficiently compliant to permit the motor to bypass inactive subunits without arrest. We speculate that such a flexible mechanism arose for motors that, like SpoIIIE, constitute functional bottlenecks where the inactivation of even a single motor can be lethal for the cell."

A group of proteins called SpoIIIE is instrumental in this process as it uses energy from a molecule called ATP to pump the DNA across the membrane at the rapid speed of 5,000 base pairs of DNA per second. SpoIIIE contains six individual protein subunits that form a ring-shaped motor structure that spans the membrane.

The experiments suggest that the DNA is handed over from one SpoIIIE subunit to another in a sequential order.

There is an element of flexibility in the system, because SpoIIIE can still move DNA normally even if some subunits cannot use energy from ATP. This provides a fail-safe mechanism that still allows the cells to form spores in the event that one subunit is disabled. Future work will concentrate in understanding how the subunits communicate around the ring to coordinate their sequential use of ATP and their DNA pumping activity."

Within the ASCE division, the FtsK/SpoIIIE family of motors is involved in the fundamental process of DNA segregation prior to cell division. During the <i><i>Bacillus</i> subtilis</i> sporulation lifecycle, an asymmetric division septum closes around one of the sister chromatids before complete chromosome segregation, trapping about two-thirds of the chromosome in the mother cell compartment (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wu and Errington, 1994</a>). To complete chromosome segregation, SpoIIIE must translocate the DNA from the mother cell into the forespore. SpoIIIE and its closely related <i><i>Escherichia</i> coli</i> homologue FtsK, contain an N-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to the division septum, a long unstructured polypeptide linker and a C-terminal-soluble motor domain consisting of subdomains \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barre, 2007</a>). Subdomains \u03b1 and \u03b2 adopt a RecA-like fold containing ATP binding and hydrolysis motifs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Massey et al., 2006</a>), while subdomain \u03b3 imparts translocation directionality to the motor (sequence dependence) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Besprozvannaya et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">L\u00f6we et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ptacin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">2008</a>).

However, many fundamental aspects of these motors\u2019 operation remain poorly understood: How does the motor interact with its DNA track during translocation? What is the motor step size?

Using modified DNA with a neutral backbone, we show that SpoIIIE makes critical electrostatic contacts with the phosphate backbone on the 5'\u21923' strand in the direction of translocation. This observation indicates that the individual subunits operate in a well-defined sequential order around the ring. To determine the SpoIIIE step size, we challenged the motor to translocate a DNA molecule containing two neutral segments of variable lengths separated by a charged base pair. This hybrid construct revealed the periodicity of motor\u2013DNA interactions, suggesting that each SpoIIIE subunit takes a 2-bp step per ATP hydrolyzed. Experiments where non-hydrolyzable nucleotides were used to probe the intersubunit coordination within the motor suggest that SpoIIIE can tolerate non-consecutive inactive subunits, implying a degree of flexibility in the sequential operation of the motor. Finally, we propose a two-subunit DNA escort model that can rationalize all these data and that correctly predicts the degree of supercoiling introduced by SpoIIIE during translocation."

Briefly, a DNA-coated bead was held in an optical trap while a SpoIIIE-coated bead was held on a micropipette (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>); SpoIIIE engaged the DNA when the beads were in close proximity, and translocated the DNA only in the presence of ATP. The DNA was held under constant tension by continuously adjusting the trap position as translocation proceeded. At saturating [ATP] (3 mM) and a low force (5 pN) SpoIIIE translocated DNA at \u223c4 kbp/s (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), in agreement with previously reported rates <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burton et al., 2007</a>) and <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ptacin et al., 2008</a>).

(ii) At high forces, SpoIIIE loses its grip on DNA and slips. These slipping events occurred in one fast rip, not in several steps, indicating that a single motor\u2013 DNA interaction is disrupted in each case (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To investigate how SpoIIIE interacts with its substrate, we designed DNA constructs containing a modified insert with a methyl-phosphonate (MeP) backbone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>), which preserves the base\u00a0pairing and overall structure of B-form DNA (<a href=\"#bib34\">Strauss and Maher, 1994</a>). We first monitored SpoIIIE translocation along a substrate containing a 30-bp double-stranded MeP (dsMeP) insert, several times longer than the expected step size of the motor. Upon reaching the insert, SpoIIIE undergoes multiple slips followed by translocation recoveries (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> inset), revealing that it makes several attempts to cross the neutral segment. Despite these attempts, SpoIIIE failed to traverse the 30-bp dsMeP segment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>), indicating that motor interactions with the negatively charged phosphates are critical for translocation."

We found that SpoIIIE can traverse dsMeP segments of 2 bp, 3 bp, and 4 bp with near-100% probability (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), but the traversal probability sharply drops to \u223c50% for dsMeP inserts of 5 bp (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). Importantly, this sharp reduction in insert crossing probability is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the average traversal time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Note that further increasing the dsMeP insert length from 5 bp to 7 bp does not significantly increase the mean traversal time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Taken together, these data show that 5 bp is the minimum length of dsMeP required to disrupt processive translocation by SpoIIIE, and indicate that SpoIIIE makes periodic electrostatic contacts with the DNA every 5 bp or less."

A slightly higher traversal probability (\u223c8%) was recorded for the 10-bp dsMeP insert (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). The dynamics of slipping and re-translocation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>, inset) at the neutral insert and the lengthy traversal times for dsMeP inserts of 5 bp or longer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>) suggest that, given a sufficient number of traversal attempts, SpoIIIE can cross even relatively long stretches of dsMeP (10\u201330 bp). The drop in traversal probability for longer dsMeP inserts suggests that the motor can hold onto MeP DNA for a short amount of time during which it can either step forward, or lose its grip on the neutral DNA. In other words, forward translocation along the MeP insert is in kinetic competition with backward slipping (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aathavan et al., 2009</a>). As a result, to traverse longer MeP inserts, the motor must execute a correspondingly larger number of consecutive productive power-strokes. We hypothesize that other types of motor\u2013DNA interactions (e.g. steric) enable the motor to traverse the neutral insert given an arbitrarily large number of crossing attempts. In support of this idea, the \u03c629 ring ATPase has been shown to require electrostatic contacts with the DNA every 10 phosphates, but relies on steric, non-specific interactions to exert force and translocate the DNA in-between those electrostatic contacts (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aathavan et al., 2009</a>)."

In this scenario, the SpoIIIE subunits would fire consecutively (subunit 1 fires, followed by subunit 2, followed by subunit 3, etc). After subunit 1 executes its power-stroke, the helical geometry of the DNA will position the phosphate backbone of the tracked strand in close proximity to subunit 2, depending on the step size of the motor (<a href=\"#bib23\">Massey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Strick and Quessada-Vial, 2006</a>). Thus, motor-DNA contacts would proceed from one subunit to the next in an ordinal fashion. (ii) The motor translocates DNA in increments of 10\u201311 bp, which closely matches the helical periodicity of dsDNA (10.4\u201310.5 bp/pitch). This mechanism would ensure that after each translocation event, the motor contacts the same strand after traversing one full helical turn along the DNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Such a mechanism is employed by the \u03c629 ring ATPase, which translocates DNA in 10-bp bursts and contacts the DNA backbone on the same strand every 10 base\u00a0pairs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Aathavan et al., 2009</a>)."

To be consistent with the observation that SpoIIIE tracks only one DNA strand (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>), all potential models require that SpoIIIE subunits fire in a well-defined sequential order around the ring (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Furthermore, since electrostatic interactions with the backbone on one strand are critical for maintaining the motor\u2019s grip on DNA, we reason that at least one electrostatic contact between the motor and the phosphate backbone is needed for SpoIIIE to maintain a stable grip on its DNA substrate. Finally, the pool of potential models can be further narrowed by making an assumption about the state of dsDNA inside the central pore of SpoIIIE during translocation. Although no ring-shaped dsDNA translocase has been co-crystallized with its substrate, it is thought that dsDNA is not significantly distorted within the central pore of ring ATPases (<a href=\"#bib23\">Massey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sun et al., 2008</a>). For example, the central channel of the FtsK ring can fully accommodate a single, undistorted B-form dsDNA strand\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Massey et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, we considered models where the helical pitch of dsDNA inside the SpoIIIE channel is similar to that of B-form DNA (10.5 bp/turn). Expanding our models to include a distorted helix similar to A-form DNA (11.0 bp/turn) would require only minor corrections and would not affect the overall predictions of these models."

Because SpoIIIE easily crosses up to 4 bp of neutral DNA, the 4-bp register is meant to align the stepping phase of SpoIIIE with the stepping-stone segment.

A 2-bp step size is in good agreement with both enzymatic and structural studies of the related dsDNA translocase FtsK, which translocates 1.6\u20132.1 bp per ATP hydrolyzed (<a href=\"#bib13\">Graham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Massey et al., 2006</a>)."

The first three frames illustrate the sequential firing of subunits A, B, and C, all of which maintain at least one anchoring contact with the phosphate backbone. Because subunit D cannot make electrostatic contacts with the backbone, it fails to propel the DNA upon firing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>, frame 5). As a result, no other subunit can establish new contacts with the DNA backbone. After subunit E translocates the DNA by 2 bp, subunit F can now latch onto a negatively\u00a0charged phosphate and continue to translocate DNA. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a> illustrates how this model copes with a 2-bp MeP probe: subunit F cannot anchor itself onto the DNA, causing the motor to pause and eventually slip (as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, magenta traces). This two-subunit DNA escort model requires one subunit to execute the power stroke while an adjacent subunit maintains its phosphate contacts during this power-stroke, escorting the DNA through the ring. In this model, the ATPase subunits translocate the DNA sequentially around the ring in a highly\u00a0coordinated fashion that enables SpoIIIE to track one DNA strand. There is increasing structural evidence for this type of motor mechanism involving 'translocating' subunits and 'escorting' subunits; examples include the <i>E.coli\u2019s</i> Rho helicase (<a href=\"#bib37\">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</a>) and the papillomavirus E1 helicase (<a href=\"#bib12\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</a>). However, unlike the E1/Rho mechanisms, which employ four escorting subunits, the SpoIIIE translocation model proposed here requires only one escorting subunit."

The density and duration of analog-induced pauses does not depend on external force (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1e\u2013f</a>), consequently pauses detected at all forces were pooled together. Given the spatio-temporal resolution of our experiments, we could reliably detect pauses longer than 30 ms at 125 \u2013250 \u03bcM ATP\u03b3S, 50 ms at 375\u2013500 \u03bcM ATP\u03b3S, and 75 ms at 750\u20131000 \u03bcM ATP\u03b3S. However, regardless of the shortest detectable pause duration and the ATP\u03b3S concentration, the distribution of measured pause durations was well described by a single exponential decay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>, inset) with the same characteristic life-time of \u223c35 ms (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). The fact that the characteristic life-time does not depend on ATP\u03b3S concentration suggests that all analog-induced pauses are drawn from the same distribution. Furthermore, the single-exponential dependence of the pause duration distribution indicates that the exit from the paused state is governed by a single rate-limiting event\u2014presumably the exchange of an ATP\u03b3S molecule with\u00a0one ATP which\u00a0is present in saturating concentrations, as proposed for other ring ATPases (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chistol et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sen et al., 2013</a>). Despite the fact that we cannot detect analog-induced pauses shorter than a certain cutoff (30\u201375 ms), we can estimate the number of missed pauses\u2014and therefore the true pause density\u2014from the measured pause density (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>) and the characteristic life-time derived from the pause distribution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>), assuming that the single-exponential distribution holds for pauses shorter than the cutoff (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hodges et al., 2009</a>) (see\u00a0'Materials and methods')."

For example, <i>n</i>=1 (green shaded region) corresponds to a sequentially coordinated ring that pauses whenever a single subunit is bound to ATP\u03b3S; <i>n</i>=2 (blue shaded region) corresponds to a sequentially coordinated ring that pauses when two consecutive subunits are both bound to ATP\u03b3S, and\u00a0so\u00a0on. The ATP\u03b3S pause-density data corrected to account for missed pauses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a> black symbols) are best described by the model in which two (n<i>=2</i>) consecutive analog-bound subunits are required to induce a pause in the motor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>, blue-shaded region). In other words, analysis of the pause density indicates that the motor can operate processively with non-consecutive inactive subunits but not with two or more consecutive subunits. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that FtsK hexamers readily bypass individual catalytically inactive ATPase subunits (<a href=\"#bib11\">Crozat et al., 2010</a>)."

Although electrostatic interactions with the backbone of the 5\u2019\u21923\u2019 strand in the direction of translocation are the principal mode of motor-substrate contact, we surmise that other types of interactions (e.g. steric) play a secondary role in maintaining SpoIIIE\u2019s grip on DNA. This inference explains why we observe small but non-zero traversal probabilities for neutral inserts of 10\u201330 bp, much longer than the expected motor step size (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). Interestingly, SpoIIIE is more likely to traverse 30-bp inserts with a neutral backbone only on the 5\u2019\u21923\u2019 strand (6 out of 28 molecules) than 30-bp inserts with a neutral backbone on both strands (1 out of 32 molecules) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To explain this discrepancy, we speculate that during translocation, in addition to the essential electrostatic interactions with the 5\u2019\u21923\u2019 strand, the SpoIIIE ring may also interact very weakly with charges on the 3'\u21925' strand. These secondary interactions could be mediated by parts of the motor other than the pore loops which execute the power \u2013 stroke."

(2) In designing the MeP inserts used in this study, care was taken to avoid an asymmetric neutralization of the phosphate backbone. The majority of the experiments with MeP inserts tested in this study utilized dsMeP modifications. Thus, the backbone neutralization was symmetrically distributed and therefore not expected to cause\u00a0significant DNA distortions. We tested only two single-stranded MeP/DNA hybrid constructs, with 30 consecutive neutralized bases on either strand, covering nearly three full helical turns of the DNA. Because the backbone neutralization was distributed evenly in all directions around the DNA helix, the charge neutralization should be symmetrical, and therefore, it is not expected to introduce significant DNA distortions."

To be consistent with the results of the stepping-stone insert experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c\u2013d</a>), our two-subunit translocation-escort model requires that subunits fire in a well- defined sequential fashion (A, B, C, D, E, F, A, B, C etc) and a subunit cannot fire multiple times in a row or out of order."

Interestingly, both SpoIIIE and the \u03c629 ATPase encircle dsDNA, positioning multiple subunits in close proximity to the dsDNA helix, while they still possess the ability to discriminate one strand from the other.

The later arises from the symmetry mismatch between the angles spanned by two adjacent SpoIIIE subunits and the angle that separates the phosphates contacted by the motor during a 2-bp step. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a> depicts the SpoIIIE-DNA complex as seen from the N\u00a0terminus of the motor; in this view, SpoIIIE translocates DNA toward the viewer (<a href=\"#bib23\">Massey et al., 2006</a>). In the two-subunit DNA escort model, the DNA is handed over from one subunit to the next and, for each 2-bp step, the motor-DNA contacts rotate clockwise around the ring by 60\u00b0. However, since B-form DNA has a helical pitch of 10.4 bp/turn (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wang, 1979</a>), the dsDNA backbone rotates clockwise by 69\u00b0 for every 2 bp. Therefore, after each motor step, a counter-clockwise 9\u00b0 rotation of the DNA relative to the motor is required to align the phosphate backbone with the next translocating subunit. As a result, the two-subunit escort model predicts that SpoIIIE should introduce one supercoil for every \u223c80 bp of DNA translocated. The magnitude and direction of this prediction is consistent with both <i>in vivo</i> measurements (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nicholson and Setlow, 1990</a>) and <i>in vitro</i> single-molecule experiments. Indeed, magnetic tweezers experiments revealed that SpoIIIE supercoils DNA by one turn per 100 \u00b1 10 bp of DNA translocated (Jerod Ptacin and Marcelo Nollman, personal communication). It was previously reported that strand tracking by the \u03c629 ATPase, another ring-shaped dsDNA motor, also leads to DNA supercoiling (<a href=\"#bib19\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). The results presented here for SpoIIIE suggest that DNA supercoiling may be a general feature of ring-shaped dsDNA motors that track one strand. The amount and direction of supercoiling should depend on the (i) the helical pitch of dsDNA, (ii) the periodicity of motor-DNA contacts (step size), and (iii) the motor\u2019s inter-subunit coordination mechanism."

Since SpoIIIE is anchored at the septum during sporulation and the <i>B. subtilis</i> DNA is circular, the two-subunit escort model predicts that SpoIIIE translocation should introduce one negative supercoil in the forespore and one positive supercoil in the mother cell for every \u223c80 bp translocated. We surmise that the SpoIIIE mechanism is fine\u00a0tuned to deliver DNA to the forespore in the appropriate negative supercoiled state, similar to what has been proposed for FtsK (<a href=\"#bib28\">Saleh et al., 2005</a>). This mechanism may help to conserve cellular resources by minimizing the amount of maintenance performed by topoisomerases/gyrases, a strategy that may provide a significant advantage in the harsh conditions that prompt sporulation (i.e., starvation)."

This conclusion can be rationalized by the two-subunit DNA escort model proposed above: having two adjacent ATPase subunits simultaneously contact the DNA enables the motor to continue translocating if either of the two subunits is inactive, but not when both are disabled. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a> illustrates how the two-subunit DNA escort model can bypass the ATP\u03b3S-bound subunit B: (i) subunit A fires and translocates DNA while subunit B escorts the DNA, (ii) the analog-bound subunit B fails to fire while subunit C was poised to escort the DNA (iii) subunit C then fires and translocates the DNA, handing it over to subunit D. During this step, subunit B, which remains bound to ATP\u03b3S, escorts the DNA for subunit C."

The authors of that study proposed a sequential DNA escort mechanism in which at least three motor subunits contact the DNA at any given time. The ATP\u03b3S experiments presented here provide additional evidence that SpoIIIE/FtsK motors can bypass individual inactive subunits. Moreover, the strand-tracking behavior reported here for SpoIIIE strongly favors a model in which ring subunits fire sequentially, a key aspect of the DNA escort mechanism proposed here and in the Crozat et al study."

How is this mechanism optimized for the specific biological task of SpoIIIE? <i>In vivo</i>, SpoIIIE is present in low copy numbers during sporulation, with only two motors responsible for the vital task of chromosome translocation at any given time (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Yen Shin et al., 2015</a>). As a result, each SpoIIIE ring functions as a single-molecule bottleneck for this process, where the failure of either motor is likely to be lethal for the cell. The coordination mechanism proposed here can potentially explain how <i>B. subtilis</i> safeguards against the failure of individual motor subunits during sporulation. We speculate that other ASCE motors that also represent single-points of failure may have evolved into similar flexible operations."

                    "text": "In this paper by Liu et al. the dsDNA translocation mechanism of the hexameric ring ATPase SpoIIIE is investigated. The authors use optical tweezers to monitor the translocation of the enzyme along DNA. In particular they study the bypass of short stretches of DNA with a neutral backbone as well as the influence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs. The study clearly shows that SpoIIIE contacts only one strand of the dsDNA during translocation and can traverse up to four consecutive MeP on one strand. However, five consecutive MeP hinder translocation of SpoIIIE. From this they conclude a two-subunit escort mechanism, where typically two adjacent subunits make contacts to the DNA. After stepping of one of the subunits, the DNA is moved by 2 bp providing engagement of an adjacent subunit in the translocation direction and disengagement of the trailing subunit. The experiments are well designed and carefully executed. The manuscript is clearly written and provides a consistent story. However, in contrast to previous studies where e.g. steps of the ring translocase from Phi29 were directly resolved, the present work relies on indirect evidence based on the length of backbone substitutions that can be overcome by the translocase. Though the argumentation of the authors is consistent and is further supported by the evaluation of the density of pauses originating from binding non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, other and potentially more complex mechanisms cannot be convincingly ruled out. For example, the data does not eliminate another model where each SpoIIIE contacts one bp of dsDNA and five subunits are involved in DNA binding similar to the mechanism proposed for Rho and E1 helicases."
