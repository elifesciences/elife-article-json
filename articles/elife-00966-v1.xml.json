However, the relevance of these discoveries to human epithelial homeostasis and its alterations in disease is unknown. By developing a novel quantitative approach for the analysis of somatic mitochondrial mutations that are accumulated over time, we demonstrate that the human upper airway epithelium is maintained by an equipotent basal progenitor cell population, in which the chance loss of cells due to lineage commitment is perfectly compensated by the duplication of neighbours, leading to \u201cneutral drift\u201d of the clone population. Further, we show that this process is accelerated in the airways of smokers, leading to intensified clonal consolidation and providing a background for tumorigenesis. This study provides a benchmark to show how somatic mutations provide quantitative information on homeostatic growth in human tissues, and a platform to explore factors leading to dysregulation and disease."

However, the relevance of these discoveries to human epithelial homeostasis and its alterations in disease is unknown. By developing a novel quantitative approach for the analysis of somatic mitochondrial mutations that are accumulated over time, we demonstrate that the human upper airway epithelium is maintained by an equipotent basal progenitor cell population, in which the chance loss of cells due to lineage commitment is perfectly compensated by the duplication of neighbours, leading to \u201cneutral drift\u201d of the clone population. Further, we show that this process is accelerated in the airways of smokers, leading to intensified clonal consolidation and providing a background for tumorigenesis. This study provides a benchmark to show how somatic mutations provide quantitative information on homeostatic growth in human tissues, and a platform to explore factors leading to dysregulation and disease."

The lining of these airways is made up of many different types of cells, which must be continuously replaced as they become damaged. Experiments in mice have shown that cells called basal cells act as progenitor cells to keep the lining supplied with new cells. Progenitor cells are similar to stem cells: they divide to make, on average, one copy of themselves and one mature cell of another type (such as a secretory cell). This ensures that healthy supply of progenitor cells is maintained for the future. However, it is not clear whether this process takes place at the level of individual progenitor cells or as an average for a population of cells."

And by applying a mathematical model across all the cells in the study, it was discovered that whenever one basal progenitor cell committed to a particular fate, another progenitor cell duplicated itself: however, this balancing process happened in a random manner across a large number of cells, and not at the level of individual progenitor cells. Interestingly, it was found random cell division happened among smokers too, but was accelerated. This leads to clusters of identical cells forming more quickly in smokers than in non-smokers. In addition to providing further insights into the origins of lung cancer, the statistical methods developed by Teixeira et al. could be used to analyse the behaviour of many other types of stem or progenitor cells."

To conserve their number, following division, one cell must on average remain in the stem cell compartment while the other must commit to a differentiation pathway. This asymmetry may be enforced at the level of individual cells, or it may be achieved on a population basis, so that stem cell proliferation is perfectly compensated by the differentiation of others (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clayton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Klein et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gomes et al., 2011</a>). In recent years there has been significant progress in defining common strategies of stem cell self-renewal using lineage tracing assays in mice (<a href=\"#bib36\">Simons and Clevers, 2011</a>). By tracing the clonal evolution of marked cells following genetic pulse-labelling of transgenic animals, statistical methods have been used to discern the pattern of adult stem cell fate in several actively cycling mammalian tissues. In skin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clayton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Doupe et al., 2010</a>), oesophagus (<a href=\"#bib7\">Doupe et al., 2012</a>), gut (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lopez-Garcia et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Snippert et al., 2010</a>) and testis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klein et al., 2010</a>), such methods have demonstrated that tissue maintenance involves the continuous stochastic loss and replacement of stem cells. However, although such approaches provide key insights into the mechanisms of stem cell maintenance in transgenic animal models, their relevance and application to human tissues is unknown."

In both humans and mice, airways are composed of basal, ciliated, secretory, and chemosensory cell populations. Collectively, these cells produce antimicrobial proteins, eliminate bacteria and toxic compounds via the mucociliary escalator, warm inspired air, and act as physical barriers to exogenous particulate matter (<a href=\"#bib23\">Knight and Holgate, 2003</a>). Previous studies of human tissue have demonstrated that basal cells can exhibit multipotent growth and differentiation properties when grown in vitro under specific conditions, while in vivo murine studies demonstrate that basal cells of the major airways function as common multipotent progenitors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Rock et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2010</a>)."

However, the range and identity of the stem cell compartment, and the frequency of stem cell loss and replacement, has not been quantified. Moreover, the relevance of these studies for the maintenance of human airways remains unexplored. In this study, we show that the continuous accumulation of somatic mutations that occur in the mitochondrial genome provides a clonal record from which the self-renewal properties of the human airway stem cell population can be inferred. As well as providing new insight into human airway maintenance, this study exemplifies a general methodological scheme that can serve as a template to study adult stem cell fate in other human tissues. Moreover, we show that the characterisation of normal tissue maintenance provides a quantitative platform from which we can study factors promoting the dysregulation of cells leading to the development of disease."

CCO gene mutations occur spontaneously in all cells in a stochastic manner, do not significantly affect cellular function, and are unrelated to cellular toxicant exposure (<a href=\"#bib8\">Elson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Taylor et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carew and Huang, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Taylor et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Taylor and Turnbull, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Greaves et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">McDonald et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fellous et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gutierrez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gaisa et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nicholson et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the division and accumulation of CCO-deficient cells leads to the formation of clonal patches of CCO-deficient cells within tissues, including the normal airway, and their examination provides a unique, histologically traceable record of airway progenitor cell fate. We use genetic sequencing to confirm the clonal origin of individual CCO patches and immunofluorescence to assess the cellular composition of these clones. Then, using statistical modelling of the frequency and size distribution of CCO-deficient clones visualised using whole mount labelling, we establish the cellular hierarchy and the in vivo pattern of airway homeostasis, making an explicit comparison between non-smokers and smokers."

Further, we show that these cells maintain homeostasis through a process of population asymmetry in which their chance loss following commitment to differentiation is perfectly balanced by the duplication of others. This stochasticity leads to a natural process of age-associated airway clonal consolidation, which is notably accelerated in smokers, most likely due to increased rates of cellular turnover. As well as its intrinsic interest to human airway stem and progenitor cell biology, this study provides the benchmark to show how quantitative insights can be obtained from in vivo lineage tracing studies in human tissues, with obvious implications for studies of clonal progression in neoplasia."

Cells deficient in CCO, but marked by porin, indicate cell patches with CCO mitochondrial DNA mutation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nicholson et al., 2011</a>). Using lung whole-mount imaging of seven patients of varying age (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), we identified and quantified CCO-deficient patches of cells within the third generation bronchi of human upper airways (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,C</a>). These patches were rare and randomly distributed within the airways (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Consistent with previous observations, no CCO-deficient individual cells, or patches of cells, were found in the 25 year old patient, despite examination of over one million cells, placing a constraint on the time taken for the chance clonal selection of a single mitochondrial mutation within an individual cell (<a href=\"#bib15\">Greaves et al., 2006</a>). Within cells, there are thousands of mitochondria, each containing multiple copies of mtDNA. mtDNA mutations are random and increase with age (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brierley et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Michikawa et al., 1999</a>). Through chance expansion these mutations can be present in all copies of the mitochondrial genome (homoplasmy) or a proportion thereof (heteroplasmy). For the mutated mitochondrial CCO genotype to result in a loss of CCO expression, homoplasmy or high levels of heteroplasmy must be present (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sciacco et al., 1994</a>)."

The upper airway epithelium contains basal, ciliated, and goblet cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), while the lower conducting airways include Clara cell secretory protein positive cells (Clara cells). To confirm a normal epithelial make up of the epithelial CCO-deficient patches we performed immunostaining of the two regions. These studies revealed that large CCO-deficient patches in upper human airways contain the expected bronchial epithelial cell types including keratin 5 positive basal cells, acetylated tubulin positive ciliated cells, and Mucin 5AC positive goblet cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>). Based on the percentage of constituent cell types, we found that there was no significant difference in cell type composition between CCO-deficient clonal patches and the neighbouring CCO-active lung epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). On examination of the lower conducting airways, the frequency of Clara cells in CCO-active lung epithelial cells matched with that of the neighbouring tissue (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of note, we observed rare c-kit positive cells, recently proposed as a putative marker for pulmonary stem cells in the airway. However, these c-kit positive cells were stained uniformly with CD45 (leucocyte common antigen), but not epithelial markers, and they were absent in most patches (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Significantly, on examining the cell types within CCO-deficient patches, only ciliated and basal cells were always present in CCO-deficient patches with more than five cells, consistent with murine data identifying basal cells as the most likely host of multipotent progenitors of the upper airway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). While the majority of clones with five cells or less contain one or more basal cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), a few small clones lack basal cells altogether suggesting basal progenitors are able to undergo terminal division leading to clone loss (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). Indeed, this behaviour is corroborated by measurements of the clone density. In total we identified 844 CCO-deficient patches among the 12.7 million cells studied in the seven patients. However, despite the ongoing marking of cells through sporadic mutation, the number of surviving clones does not increase substantially between 39 to 79 year old patients (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As well as providing further evidence of clone loss through differentiation, this result suggests that the frequency of loss and replacement may be high."

First, as a result of the sporadic nature of cell labelling, the clonal history of \u2018young\u2019 clones is not readily disentangled from that of clones induced in the distant past. For example, small clones may derive from recently induced cells or they may be associated with chance expansion and contraction through differentiation and cell loss in older early marked cells. Furthermore, the interpretation of the clonal fate data, and the association of clone size with a measure of the number of constituent progenitor cells in the clone, may be further complicated by the existence of a transit-amplifying cell hierarchy. Therefore, to critically assess the clonal data for signatures of equipotency and progenitor cell fate, it is useful to develop a simple and robust biophysical modelling scheme, the validity of which can be checked self-consistently through characteristics in the clone fate data."

Moreover, from the extrapolation of <i>N(t)</i> to zero, we can deduce that CCO-deficient mutations become visible in patients at approximately 20 \u00b1 10 years of age, consistent with the absence of CCO-deficient patches in the 25 year old patient."

Intriguingly, this compares to the inferred value for non-smokers of 2<i>r\u03bb</i> = 1 \u00b1 0.5/year, a factor of around two smaller. Further support for this conclusion is found from the observation of single cell clones, which are more prevalent in non-smokers than smokers (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with a higher rate of turnover in the later. Although this methodology provides the means to estimate the progenitor cell loss/replacement rate, the total cell division rate is not accessible. Cell divisions leading to asymmetric fate have no impact on clone size. As a result, we cannot say whether the acceleration of loss/replacement in smokers is simply a reflection of enhanced proliferation, or represents a tilt in the balance between symmetric and asymmetric cell division."

Such a slow growth is a manifestation of the neutrality of clonal evolution leading to the chance loss of the majority of induced progenitors. This dependence of clone density on the parameters of cell fate can be used to further challenge the model. From the small increase in clone density in smokers from 39 to 79 years (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), as expected from the predicted logarithmic growth dependence, using the inferred values of <i>r\u03bb/\u03c1</i> and <i>N(t)</i>, we find a mutation rate of <i>R</i> = 100 \u00b1 10/year/cm<sup>2</sup>. With a cell density of around 10<sup>6</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, this translates to the acquisition of CCO deficiency at a rate of around 10<sup>\u22124</sup>/cell/year.

Our use, for the first time, of whole-mount human lung imaging allowed us to use quantitative analysis of these clones to demonstrate both that basal cells are the likely multipotent progenitor cells in the human upper airways and that airway homeostasis is maintained in a stochastic manner. The demonstration that a few small clones lack basal cells is consistent with terminal differentiation of a stem cell within a said clone, which would eventually lead to its loss."

In our whole mount imaging of large bronchi Clara cells are virtually absent, as found by others (<a href=\"#bib1\">Boers et al., 1998</a>), but in distal conducting airway epithelium of normal human lungs Clara cells make up between 11 and 22% of the epithelial population and 9% of the overall proliferative compartment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boers et al., 1999</a>). In analysing the data, we have placed emphasis on a model in which progenitor cell fate choice follows from cell-autonomous (intrinsic) regulation, that is it is insensitive to environmental factors. However, previous studies have shown that, in the two-dimensional geometry pertinent to the lung epithelium, a process in which progenitor cell loss was compensated by duplication of neighbouring progenitors through a coordinated process would lead to the same long-term exponential clone size distribution considered here, while the average clone size would acquire a small additional logarithmic dependence on time, which would not be resolved by the current data (<a href=\"#bib21\">Klein et al., 2010</a>). As such, the question of the regulatory control underlying stochastic fate specification and balance is left open. In addition, these findings do not rule out the potential for a stem/progenitor cell hierarchy, with progenitors supported by a second quiescent stem cell population, as recently resolved in normal interfollicular epidermis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mascre et al., 2012</a>)."

Crucially, in the two-dimensional setting relevant to an epithelial tissue, long-term clonal evolution does discriminate between these possibilities (<a href=\"#bib20\">Klein and Simons, 2011</a>).

As discussed in the main text, we have acquired clonal fate data for six patients, three smokers and three non-smokers. First, to sensibly interpret the clonal fate data, it is necessary to make sure that the data is not compromised by clonal merger due to chance induction events at near-neighbouring sites in the tissue. For the smokers, we find a clone density of around 100 patches/cm<sup>2</sup>. This translates to a typical clone separation of around <i>a\u223c1</i>000 microns, around two orders of magnitude larger than the typical cell diameter. Since, on this background, the chance of finding a clone with a separation <i>r</i> is given by"

For clones of approximately 50 cells or more, this equates to around 1 in 20 clones. For these sizes, merger can play a role.

The first involves rare events: Although theory may correctly predict the existence of very large clones, their frequency may be very small. As a result, one would have to make a vast number of measurements to resolve the tail of the distribution. In a typical experiment, where the number of clones is limited, such clones may not appear at all. Such rare event phenomena will give rise to strong statistical fluctuations that will plague the data for large enough clone sizes. Second, the epithelial lining of the human airways is not flat but involves a ductal structure. While clones are small, the geometry will be flat and the clone sizes will be expected to conform to the basic paradigm. However, when clone sizes become sufficiently large, the warping of the clone can also lead to constraints that confine the growth of the clone. Again, this will lead to a reduction in clone fraction at larger sizes. Thirdly, as we have seen, the infrequent chance clone merger can influence the statistics leading to a mis-representation of clone size that, by the nature of the first incomplete moment, would most adversely effect large clones. Finally, the departure of theory and data for very large clone sizes could signal a breakdown of the basic modelling scheme. For example, if tissue plays host to a rare slow-cycling stem cell population, the growth dynamics could vary. In practice, since such clones are expected to persist long term, it is likely that such a population would compromise the smaller clone sizes where exponential distribution is most robust."

The biophysical modelling analysis was based on whole mount samples obtained from the third generation bronchi. Lobectomy specimens were used that had two clear features. First the surgical cut was across the second generation bronchus (meaning the upper on the right and left; or lower lobe on the left; or lower or middle lobe on the right). The resection margin was retained by pathology and the next/third generation bronchi dissected out by the research team. Second, any resected tumour had to be in the distal lung parenchyma to avoid close proximity to the whole mount area. Importantly, the distal end of the samples were blocked and shown to be normal by H&E histology assessment. We analysed samples from seven patients. To make these points clear, we have summarised these points in the main text and referred to a more detailed discussion in a revised Materials and methods section."
