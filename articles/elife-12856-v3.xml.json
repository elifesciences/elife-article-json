Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif (THDI), however it is not clear how Myo3 specifically acts through Espin1 to regulate the actin bundle assembly and stabilization. Here we discover that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, revealing an unexpected Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 not only elucidate the mechanism of the binding, but also reveal a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism. We also provide evidence that Myo3-mediated cross-linking can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1."

Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif (THDI), however it is not clear how Myo3 specifically acts through Espin1 to regulate the actin bundle assembly and stabilization. Here we discover that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, revealing an unexpected Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 not only elucidate the mechanism of the binding, but also reveal a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism. We also provide evidence that Myo3-mediated cross-linking can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1."

The first member of Myo3 was identified in <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptors and named as NinaC (neither inactivation nor afterpotential C) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Montell and Rubin, 1988</a>).

Later, shorter spliced isoforms of <i>Espin</i> gene products (Espin2B, Espin3A and Espin4) were shown to be expressed in other F-actin rich structures such as brush border microvilli and Purkinje cell dendritic spines (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartles et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sekerkova et al., 2003</a>). They share a common 14\u2009kDa C-terminal actin binding domain (ABD; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which was reported to be necessary and sufficient for F-actin bundling activity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartles, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bartles et al., 1998</a>). Besides the ABD, all Espin isoforms contain a WH2 motif which can bind to actin monomer and a proline rich (PR) region which can interact with profilins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sekerkova et al., 2006</a>). Espin2B contains one more PR region and an extra actin binding site (xAB) at the N-terminus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 1999</a>). Espin1 is the longest isoform in the family and contains a stretch of ankyrin repeats (AR) in its N-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The AR of Espin1 is responsible for directly interacting with Myo3 tail THDI (<a href=\"#bib30\">Merritt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Salles et al., 2009</a>). Recently, it was reported that Espin1 contains an AR binding sequence immediately C-terminal to xAB, and binding of AR to this sequence prevents xAB from binding to actin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>). As such, the actin binding activity of the N-terminal part of Espin1 is auto-inhibited, and this AR-binding region is named as the auto-inhibitory region (AI, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The authors also proposed that Myo3 binding can release the auto-inhibition and increase the diameter of Espin1-promoted actin bundles (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>)."

Importantly, co-expression of Myo3a and Espin1 can further stimulate elongation of stereocilia in cultured organ of Corti hair cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Salles et al., 2009</a>).

Also, transgenic mice with DFNB30 mutation undergo age-dependent outer hair cell degeneration (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walsh et al., 2011</a>).

Based on these structural findings, we predict that binding of Myo3 to Espin1 can cluster Espin1 and thus enable Espin1 to further cross-link actin filaments into higher order fibers. Consistent with this prediction, we demonstrate by electron and fluorescence microscopic studies that binding of Myo3 to Espin1 can further promote formation of Espin1-mediated thicker actin bundles."

Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based quantitative binding assay, we found that purified THDI from both Myo3a and Myo3b can bind to Espin1-AR with high affinities (K<sub>d</sub> in the range of tens of nanomolars; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Inspection of the ITC-based titration curves indicated that the binding stoichiometry of the Myo3 THDI and Espin1-AR clearly deviates from the value of 1:1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We thus hypothesized that each of the two repeat sequences in Myo3 THDI may independently bind to Espin1-AR, forming a 2:1 stoichiometric complex. We verified this prediction by gel filtration chromatography and static light scattering experiments (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In the gel filtration analysis, addition of an equivalent molar amount of Espin1-AR to Myo3b-THDI resulted in a complex peak with a smaller elution volume (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Addition of another molar equivalent of Espin1-AR further shifted the complex peak to a smaller elution volume (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). However, further addition of Espin1-AR did not change the elution volume of the complex any more, indicating that Myo3b THDI is saturated by the binding of two molar ratios Espin1-AR (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). To accurately determine the stoichiometry, we used fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) coupled with multi-angle light scattering (FPLC-MALS) to calculate the molecular mass of the Myo3b THDI and Espin1-AR complex. When mixed Myo3b THDI with saturated amount of Trx-tagged Espin1-AR, the fitted molecular weight of the complex peak (~109.5\u2009kDa) matches well with the theoretical molecular weight of 117\u2009kDa for the (Trx-Espin1-AR)<sub>2</sub>/Myo3b-THDI complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), confirming that Myo3 THDI contains two Espin1-AR binding sites."

                                "text": "To understand the molecular basis of the Espin1/Myo3 interaction, we solved the crystal structure of the Espin1-AR/Myo3b-ARB1 complex at 1.65\u2009\u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The structure revealed that Espin1-AR contains 10 ANK repeats (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), instead of 8 as predicted earlier (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartles et al., 1996</a>). The repeats 2\u20139 each contains the signature \u2018TPLH\u2019 sequence at the N-terminus of the \u03b1A helix, so can be viewed as the canonical ANK repeats. Like shown in the recently determined structures of the 24 ANK repeats scaffold protein ankyrin-B (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2014</a>) and the 9 ANK repeats RNase L (<a href=\"#bib18\">Han et al., 2012</a>), the two ANK repeats capping the two termini of Espin1-AR do not contain the \u2018TPLH\u2019 sequence (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We believe that these two non-canonical ANK repeats capping the two termini of Espin1-AR mainly play a structural stabilization role of the entire AR fold. The 10 ANK repeats form a left-handed superhelix with the \u03b1A helices forming the inner groove and the \u03b1B helices forming the outer surface (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Clear additional electron densities lining the inner groove of the ANK repeats allowed us to build the bound Myo3b-ARB1 peptide model with high confidence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The ARB1 binds to Espin1-AR in an antiparallel manner, similar to the binding mode between ANK repeats from Ankyrin R/B/G and their targets (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2014</a>) as well as between ANKRA2/RFXANK and their targets (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that elongated inner grooves are common target binding sites of ANK repeats in general. The ARB1 spans nearly the entire inner groove, covering ~1230 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> of solvent accessible area. The N-terminal of ARB1 adopts an extended structure and binds to the C-terminal of Espin1-AR. The C-terminal of ARB1 forms an \u03b1-helix and binds to the N-terminal half of Espin1-AR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The amino acid sequences of Espin1-AR from different vertebrate species as well as of the mammalian paralogs Espin-like proteins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shin et al., 2013</a>) are highly conserved (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We mapped the sequence conservation profile to the structure of Espin1-AR and found that the residues in the inner groove of AR are highly conserved. In particular the residues in the ARB1 binding surface are essentially totally conserved (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Two absolutely conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr1267<sub>ARB1</sub> and Tyr1268<sub>ARB1</sub>, the double tyrosine (\u2018YY\u2019) motif; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and Leu1271<sub>ARB1</sub> in the next turn insert into the hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminal of Espin1-AR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A1</a>). In addition, the hydroxyl groups of the \u2018YY\u2019 motif also make hydrogen bonds. Mutations of these two tyrosine residues to alanine greatly decreased Myo3b-ARB1\u2019s binding to Espin1-AR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similarly, mutation of Leu110 in the Espin1-AR hydrophobic pocket to a polar residue aspartic acid decreased the affinity by ~10-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Furthermore, the carboxyl group of Asp1264<sub>ARB1</sub> makes hydrogen bonds with Asn69 and Ser103. Mutation of this residue together with Glu1263<sub>ARB1</sub> to alanines decreased the affinity by ~10-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The second region is composed of Espin1 repeats 5\u20138 and binds to the middle-stretch of ARB1 with an extended conformation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A2</a>). Both the side chains and backbone carbonyl of Leu1259<sub>ARB1</sub> are involved in the interaction. Asp205 located in the finger loop between repeat 6 and 7 forms a salt bridge with Lys1257<sub>ARB1</sub> and a hydrogen bond with Gln1254<sub>ARB1</sub>. Mutation of Lys1257<sub>ARB1</sub> into a reversed charged residue glutamic acid, together with Leu1259<sub>ARB1</sub> to alanine substitution also decreased the affinity by about ~10-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The third region involves inner groove of the Espin1-AR repeats 8\u201310, which is highly enriched with negatively charged residues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A3</a>). The two highly conserved Arg residues at the beginning of Myo3b-ARB1 (Arg1251<sub>ARB1</sub> and Arg1252<sub>ARB1</sub>) insert into the negatively charged pocket (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A3</a>). Mutating these two arginine residues to reverse charged residues glutamic acid decreased Myo3B-ARB1 binding to Espin1-AR by ~15-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). By analyzing the sequence of the ARBs from Myo3, we found that there exist more positively charged residues in addition to the highly conserved Arg residues at the further N-terminal end of ARB2 from both Myo3a and Myo3b (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We anticipate that these additional positively charged residues might also be involved in the binding, as there remain unoccupied, negatively charged surfaces in the third region of the Espin1-AR/Myo3b-ARB1 structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A3</a>). Indeed, substitutions of the more N-terminal positively charged residues of Myo3b-ARB2 (Arg1282<sub>ARB2</sub> and Lys1283<sub>ARB2</sub>) with alanines decreased its binding to Espin1-AR by ~10-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>)."

Despite the high similarity, there are still a few minor differences. First of all, the C-terminal \u03b1-helix of ARB2 is shorter. The interaction is mediated by a hydrogen bond between Asp1294 and Tyr144, instead of the more extensive interaction observed in Myo3b-ARB1 complex (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Moreover, the positively charged residues in the N-terminus of ARB2 cannot be reliably built, probably due to the high salt concentration in the crystallization buffer (1.6 M ammonium sulfate). Nonetheless, clear electron density can be observed near the negatively charged surface (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Indeed, substitutions of these positively charged residues with Ala weakened the binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013I</a>). Furthermore, the involvement of more positively charged residues of ARB2 may compensate for the less extensive interaction in its shorter C-terminal helix, thus resulting in a similar binding affinity to Espin1-AR as ARB1 does (107 nM for ARB1 vs 53 nM for ARB2, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C2 and C3</a>)."

By comparing the sequence of AI (aa 496\u2013529) with the consensus sequence of Myo3-ARBs, we find that Espin1-AI bears high sequence homology with Myo3-ARBs (e.g. the completely conserved \u2018YY\u2019 motif, the central \u2018KxL\u2019 motif, and the N-terminal positively charged residues; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, we predict that AI may bind to Espin1-AR with a similar binding mode as Myo3-ARBs do. We used ITC-based binding assay to test this prediction, and found that Espin1-AI can indeed bind to Espin1-AR, albeit with a more moderate affinity than Myo3-ARBs (K<sub>d</sub> of 1.32 \u03bcM vs 0.05~0.1 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C1</a>). Fully consistent with our structure-based sequence alignment analysis, substitutions of the two tyrosines in Espin1-AI to alanines greatly weakened its binding to Espin1-AR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C2</a>). Given that the AI segment (aa 496\u2013529) is immediately C-terminal to xAB (aa 462\u2013487) of Espin1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), one might envision that the interaction between Espin1 AR and AI can conformationally mask the xAB\u2019s actin binding activity and thus renders Espin1 in an auto-inhibited conformation."

Based on our analysis, the most likely mechanism for Myo3a/b-ARB1-mediated stimulation of xAB\u2019s actin binding may be due to the release of AI binding from Espin1-AR by direct competition of Myo3a/b-ARB1 binding. We designed biochemistry experiments to support the above model. If Myo3-ARB1 can indeed compete with AI for binding to Espin1-AR, then Myo3-ARB1 must still be able to bind to the auto-inhibited Espin1 but with an affinity weaker than binding to the isolated Espin-1-AR. We obtained highly purified N-terminal auto-inhibitory fragment of Espin1 spanning from AR to AI (denoted as Espin1-1-529, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and the full length Espin1 (denoted as Espin1-FL), and found that both proteins exist as monomer in solution (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that Espin1 auto-inhibition is intra-molecular in nature. ITC-based assay further showed that Myo3a-ARB1 can indeed bind to both Espin1-1-529 and Espin1-FL and with a weaker binding affinity than binding to Espin1-AR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D1\u20133</a>), consistent with a partially blocked Espin1-AR binding groove by AI. We also noticed that the ITC titration reactions of Myo3a-ARB1 to Espin1-1-529 and Espin1-FL are endothermic (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D1 and 4D2</a>) instead of the exothermic reactions between Myo3a-ARB1 titrating to Espin1-AR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D3</a>), further indicating that the binding of Myo3a-ARB1 to the auto-inhibited Espin1 is not a simple direct association process between ARB1 and AR. To provide further proof, we truncated Espin1 from the C-terminus just before the AI (i.e., aa 1\u2013494, denoted as Espin1-1-494) and found that Espin1-1-494 binds to Myo3a-ARB1 with an affinity similar to that between Espin1-AR and Myo3a-ARB1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D3</a>), indicating that AI is indeed responsible for the decreased binding of Espin1 to Myo3a-ARB1."

                                "text": "Myo3a is known to localize at the tip of filopodia when transfected in heterologous cells like HeLa or COS7 cells, whereas Myo3b alone cannot tip-localize as it lacks ABM (<a href=\"#bib22\">Les Erickson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Salles et al., 2009</a>). However, when co-expressed with Espin1, Myo3b can bind to Espin1 and localize to the tip of filopodia (<a href=\"#bib27\">Manor et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Merritt et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, Myo3a lacking ABM can only tip-localize when co-expressed with Espin1. Deletion of the Myo3 kinase domain is known to render the motor in a constant active state in promoting the length of filopodia, thus we used Myo3 constructs lacking the kinase domain in the subsequent experiments (<a href=\"#bib22\">Les Erickson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Quintero et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">2013</a>). We first tested the role of Myo3/Espin1 binding on Myo3a\u2019s ability to tip-localize. To test our biochemical findings and to determine the impact of Myo3-ARB \u2018YY\u2019 motifs on Myo3-Espin1 interaction, Espin1 transportation (i.e., tip localization) and filopodia elongation, we co-expressed various Myo3a\u0394K\u0394ABM (lacking the kinase domain and the ABM) and Myo3b\u0394K constructs with Espin1 in COS7 cells. Since both Myo3a\u0394K\u0394ABM and Myo3b\u0394K cannot tip-localize by its own, we reasoned that when co-expressed with Espin1, the Myo3 and Espin1 tip localization levels will determine the intactness of their mutual binding. As expected, both GFP-tagged wild type Myo3a (lacking the kinase domain and the ABM, denoted as \u0394K\u0394ABM) and RFP-tagged Espin1 localized to the tip of filopodia when co-transfected in COS7 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A1</a>). Mutation of the \u2018YY\u2019 motif of either of the ARBs (denoted as mARB1 and mARB2) only had a moderate or even unobservable effect on filopodia tip localization for both Myo3a and Espin1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicating that ARB1 and ARB2 may play some redundant functions in this overexpression system. Mutations of both \u2018YY\u2019 motifs (mARB1+mARB2, denoted as mARB) significantly reduced the filopodia tip localization of Myo3a (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Similarly, deletion of one ARB had a moderate effect and deletion of both ARBs had a much more severe effect on filopodia tip localization of Myo3a (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We have also tested the effect of the corresponding set of mutations or deletions of ARBs on Myo3b, and observed similar results (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as those of Myo3a. It is worth noting that the ratio of tip to cell body protein level of Myo3b is significantly less than that of Myo3a (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and C</a>), which is also consistent with previously reported findings (<a href=\"#bib27\">Manor et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Merritt et al., 2012</a>), but the detailed mechanism for this difference is unknown. The above results demonstrate that both ARBs in Myo3a or Myo3b are important for filopodia tip localizations of Myo3 and Espin1."

                                "text": "Our above structural and biochemical characterizations of the Myo3 and Espin1 interactions point to a likely regulatory role of Myo3 on Espin1\u2019s actin binding and bundling activity. It can be deduced that binding of Myo3-ARBs can first release the auto-inhibited conformation of Espin1. Perhaps more importantly, formation of Myo3/Espin1 complex leads to two Espin1 molcules to be juxtaposed to each other, forming a Myo3 cross-linked Espin1 dimer. Due to the large space between the N-terminal AR and C-terminal ABD in Espin1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), this Myo3-mediated cross-linking positions the two copies of Espin1 ABD at a distance considerably larger than those allowed by other known actin cross-linking proteins. Therefore, we predicted that binding of Myo3 may stimulate higher order actin bundling activity of Espin1. We used both fluorescent microscopy (FM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques to exam the Espin1-mediated F-actin bundles with and without the binding of Myo3 ARBs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Under FM, the F-actin alone showed only background signal when probed by fluorescence-labeled phalloidin since individual F-actin is too small to be resolved (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, left). This is consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>), and also directly revealed by our TEM study showing the nm sized F-actin filaments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, right). When Espin1 was added into the F-actin solution, uniform needle like bundles could be observed under FM. TEM showed that the bundle size is ~190 \u00b1 8 nm in width (mean \u00b1 SEM) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A1 and C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). According to the auto-inhibited model, these actin bundles are probably induced by the C-terminal ABD of Espin1. By adding ARB1 or ARB2 to Espin1 and F-actin containing solution, some of the actin bundles were cross-linked and formed clusters under FM and TEM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A2 and 3</a>). Similar phenomena have also been observed earlier using Myo3/Espin1/actin co-polymerization bundling assay (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>), instead of the post-polymerization bundling assay employed in this study. From the TEM images, the diameter of the cluster is slightly larger than Espin1 only (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A2 and A3</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). Quantification of the F-actin bundle width from the TEM images revealed that the addition of ARBs slightly increased the width of the actin bundles, with 216 \u00b1 9 nm for the ARB1 group and 218 \u00b1 9 nm for the ARB2 group (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The above data suggest that the cluster is formed by the Espin1-ABD mediated actin bundles and the ARB1/ARB2 binding releases the xAB, providing an additional actin binding site for forming slightly wider and more branched actin bundles. Interestingly, when ARB12 were added to Espin1 and F-actin containing solution, significantly thicker, elongated, and less branched bundles were observed under FM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A4</a>, left), a morphology clearly distinct from that with the addition of either ARB1 alone or ARB2 alone. When examined under TEM, the thicker bundles appear to be composed of several thinner actin bundles as observed in the Espin1-ABD-promoted actin bundles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A4</a>, right and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), indicating that Myo3-ARB12-mediated binding of Espin1 can promote/stabilize parallel actin fiber formation presumably due to Myo3 mediated cross-linking of Espin1. Quantification of the width of actin bundles formed in the presence the Myo3-ARB12 and Espin1 showed that the average width of the actin bundles are significantly larger (330 \u00b1 20; with the thickest bundles reaching ~600 nm in width) than the other three groups (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). As a control, Myo3a-ARB12 alone could not cause bundling of F-actin (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Based on these results, we propose a model that, first the Espin1-ABD is able to bundle F-actins, forming the thin F-actin bundles; then the two Espin1 binding sites located at the tail of Myo3 not only release the auto-inhibition of but also cross-link Espin1, further assembling the thin actin-bundles into thicker parallel actin bundle fibers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Therefore, one can envision that a key function of the Myo3/Espin1 interaction is to promote formation of thicker parallel actin bundle fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia."

These discoveries, together with our cell-based filopodia formation and localization assay and microscopic-based actin bundling assay, provide compelling evidences showing that Myo3 and Espin1 work together to assemble and promote higher order parallel actin bundle formation in cellular processes such as stereocilia. We believe that our model reveals the probable underlying molecular mechanism of hearing loss development (stereocilia degeneration) in humans with mutations in Myo3a (DFNB30) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Walsh et al., 2002</a>). It is believed that the delayed hearing loss phenotype in DFNB30 subjects could be due to Myo3b compensatory mechanism (<a href=\"#bib27\">Manor et al., 2012</a>), a hypothesis supported by our results as well. With the help of the motor domain-mediated high affinity binding of Myo3 to actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dose et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kambara et al., 2006</a>), the full-length Myo3/Espin1 complex may have even higher actin fiber bundling activity than the Myo3-ABR12/Espin1 complex studied in this work. As such, our study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin binding-induced actin bundling activity regulation mechanism of an actin filament cross-linker protein. It also demonstrates an intimate synergistic action mechanism between two classes of actin binding proteins, namely actin filament-based myosin motors and actin filament cross-linking protein, in controlling actin fiber size and stability. It has been reported that another unconventional myosin in stereocilia, Myosin XVa, can form a complex with an actin capping protein Eps8 to regulate stereocilia elongations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Manor et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that working together with actin binding proteins to regulate actin skeletal dynamics might be a new mode of function for unconventional myosins."

                        "text": "Fitting with this model, stereocilia in <i>jerker</i> mice are thinner in their diameters likely due to loss of Espin1-mediated higher order actin fiber assembly, easier to form tapered structures and easier to degenerate presumably due to stability decrease of less bundled actin fibers in stereocilia (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sekerkova et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zheng et al., 2000</a>). As one of the three known actin cross-linkers in stereocilia, the abundance of Espin is relatively low compared to fascin and plastin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shin et al., 2013</a>). It has been proposed that Espin may play a regulating role in elongation and widening of actin bundle by concentrating at the tip of stereocilia instead of major structural cross-linking roles (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avenarius et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Loomis et al., 2003</a>). Interestingly, the abundance of Myo3 (both Myo3a and Myo3b together) is similar to that of Espin (a few hundred copies per stereocilium) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shin et al., 2013</a>), indicating that Myo3 and Espin1 may work together to regulate higher order actin bundle structure formation and stability in stereocilia. Both Myo3 and Espin1 are known to concentrate at the tips of stereocilia in hair cells and at the tips of filopodia when expressed in heterologous cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Merritt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Salles et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schneider et al., 2006</a>). It is possible that stabilization of the growing end of the actin filaments at the plus ends by both Myo3 and Espin1 is a critical driving force for actin filament elongations (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avenarius et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Loomis et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Shin et al., 2013</a>)."

Such large differences in their cargo bindings probably match with the distinct functional properties of these myosins. For a fast-moving cargo transporting motor such as myosin VI, it is important that the motor assumes as a dimer and gets activated for moving in one direction upon binding to a cognate cargo. In such a case, the binding of a cargo protein to the motor tail exerts large impact on the motor activity regulations. As a high duty ratio motor, processive and rapid movement along the actin filaments is not likely to be the main function of Myo3, although the motor can still move towards the plus end of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib22\">Les Erickson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Merritt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Salles et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schneider et al., 2006</a>). Instead, one of Myo3\u2019s key functions appears to coordinate with its cargo protein Espin1 to regulate Espin1-mediated actin filaments assembly and stability. Whether such myosin binding-mediated cargo activity regulation is also adopted by other unconventional myosins, particularly for those not known to play transporting roles, is an interesting research topic in the future."

We demonstrate that the Espin1 binding sites in Myo3a and Myo3b are essentially identical and therefore are predicted to be functionally interchangeable. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the partially redundant functions of Myo3a and Myo3b in hair cells. This analysis also predicts that Espin-like proteins can also bind to Myo3 as Espin1 does, suggesting that the functions of Espin1 and Espin-like protein may also be partially redundant in tissues like stereocilia (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shin et al., 2013</a>). Such redundancies suggest that mutation of single <i>myo3a</i> or <i>myo3b</i> or defects in <i>espin1</i> or <i>espin-like</i> may not always develop severe phenotypes in vertebrates. Moreover, we note that <i>forked</i>, the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of <i>Espin</i>, is expressed in bristle cells, a cell type that is enriched in bundled actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib34\">Petersen et al., 1994</a>). <i>Drosophila</i> Forked protein is predicted to contain five ANK repeats, corresponding to Espin1 repeats 5\u20139.

Myo3a localize to the very tip of filopodia, while Myo3b distributes in a wider tip-base gradient (<a href=\"#bib30\">Merritt et al., 2012</a>). The different tip localization patterns of Myo3a and Myo3b does not originate from the unique ABM of Myo3a (<a href=\"#bib27\">Manor et al., 2012</a>). Our study here suggests that their Espin1 binding THDI regions are not responsible for different localizations of Myo3a and Myo3b along stereocilia/filopodia either. It is possible that the kinetics and the F-actin binding affinities of their motor domains or other variable regions in their tails may contribute to such differences."

Based on the results in this study, we anticipate that these two myosins might use different unstructured fragments in their tails to specifically recognize various cargoes. A very recent report showed that another region in Myo3a\u2019s tail, which is located immediately N-terminal to the Espin1 binding ARB12 region, can bind to MORN4 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mecklenburg et al., 2015</a>), the mammalian ortholog of <i>Drosophila</i> Retinophilin.

Espin1 contains a set of ankyrin repeats that bind to Myo3. The authors identify two related sequences within Myo3, ARB1 and ARB2, and show that these sequences bind independently to the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of Espin1. Structures of the Espin1 ankyrin repeats bound to ARB1 and to ARB2 peptides from Myo3 show that each binds similarly to the ARD, suggesting that a single Myo3 can trigger dimerization of Espin1. The authors also provide structural and biophysical evidence that the Espin1 autoinhibitory sequence, which inhibits Espin1 binding to actin, resembles the two Myo3 ARB sequences and competes for a common site in the ankyrin repeats. Studies in hair cells support a role for the ARB1/2-ARD interaction in colocalization of Myo3 and Espin1, while light microscopy and electron micrographs provide evidence that Espin1 mediates higher order bundling of actin."

However, these data do not show that it is the putative AI domain, as opposed to some other region of Espin1, that is responsible for the elevated K<sub>d</sub> and switch from exothermic to endothermic binding reaction. The authors should assay binding of ARB either to an Espin1 fragment truncated just before the AI sequence (and no more) or introduce mutations in AI domain residues that relieve autoinhibition, and then show that Myo3a binds more tightly to this Espin1 fragment."

There should be a detailed comparison of these two structures in figures that would enable the reader to do a side-by side comparison of contacts by ARB1 versus ARB2. Differences in the way in which the two bind to the AR may underlie the apparent differences that mutations in ARB1 versus ARB2 have in the in vivo experiments, where mutations of the Tyr residues in ARB2 seem to have a much stronger effect on recruitment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). It may be helpful to show electron density for the ARB2 structure as well, either to justify the chain tracing or show where the peptide trace may be ambiguous (and therefore may account for the apparent difference)."

There should be a detailed comparison of these two structures in figures that would enable the reader to do a side-by side comparison of contacts by ARB1 versus ARB2. Differences in the way in which the two bind to the AR may underlie the apparent differences that mutations in ARB1 versus ARB2 have in the in vivo experiments, where mutations of the Tyr residues in ARB2 seem to have a much stronger effect on recruitment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). It may be helpful to show electron density for the ARB2 structure as well, either to justify the chain tracing or show where the peptide trace may be ambiguous (and therefore may account for the apparent difference).</i>"

Despite the high similarity, there are still a few minor differences. First of all, the C-terminal \u03b1-helix of ARB2 is shorter. The interaction is mediated by a hydrogen bond between Asp1294 and Tyr144, instead of the more extensive interaction observed in Myo3b-ARB1 complex (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B). Moreover, the positively charged residues in the N-terminus of ARB2 cannot be reliably built, probably due to the high salt concentration in the crystallization buffer (1.6 M ammonium sulfate). Nonetheless, clear electron density can be observed near the negatively charged surface (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A). Indeed, substitutions of these positively charged residues with Ala weakened the binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3G-I). Furthermore, the involvement of more positively charged residues of ARB2 may compensate for the less extensive interaction in its shorter C-terminal helix, thus resulting in a similar binding affinity to Espin1-AR as ARB1 does (107 nM for ARB1 vs 53 nM for ARB2, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C2 and C3</a>).\u201d"

The protein level for Espin in stereocilia is relatively low when comparing to fascin and plastin, two additional actin filament crosslinking proteins. It is unlikely that Espin plays a major structural role in the cross-linking of F-actin in stereocilia. When reading the Nature Neuroscience paper by Shin et al. 2013, it is interesting to note that the protein level for Myo3a/b together is at a similar range as Espin (a few hundred copies per stereocilium). What we propose here (as also proposed by others) is that Myo3 and Espin (perhaps also espin-like protein) might work together to perform certain regulating role in elongation and widening of actin bundles.
