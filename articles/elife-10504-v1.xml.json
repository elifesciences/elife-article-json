One of the reasons for this is that most fungi produce a multitude of small organic molecules called secondary metabolites. Different species employ a strikingly diverse arsenal of secondary metabolites, most of which are released into the environment (<a href=\"#bib5\">Sanchez et al., 2012</a>). Secondary metabolites are not directly required to ensure the growth of the organism, but confer an advantage under specific environmental conditions."

Secondary metabolism is therefore likely to be shaped to a large extent by interactions with other organisms. For example, fungi secrete enzymes to digest their food, which allows them to grow on virtually any organic matter, but also means that the products of their digestion are in principle a free meal for other organisms. And by secreting secondary metabolites that target these organisms, fungi are able to defend their niche to avoid competitors taking advantage of the available food."

However, it is not known what roles most of these molecules play in the lives of the fungi that produce them. Moreover, most secondary metabolites are not produced when the fungi are grown in the laboratory, which makes it difficult to characterize them. Now in <i>eLife</i>, Matthias Brock and co-workers \u2013 including Markus Gressler as first author \u2013 report a new role for a major secondary metabolite called terrein, and characterize the environmental stimuli that induce the mold <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> to produce it (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Gressler et al., 2015</a>)."

This analysis revealed that the genes that encode the terrein biosynthetic pathway are activated by three independent environmental stimuli: nitrogen starvation, iron starvation, and the presence of the amino acid methionine. These conditions are typically found in the plant and the plant root area, known as the rhizosphere, and are used by the mold to sense these niches."

Nitrogen and iron also regulate the production of other secondary metabolites (<a href=\"#bib6\">Tudzynski, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Wiemann et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that these environmental cues are often used to adjust secondary metabolism. The complex environmental control of terrein production revealed by Gressler et al. represents a prime example of how microorganisms adapt their secondary metabolism to the niche they inhabit."

Now, Gressler et al. have discovered that terrein supports iron uptake by the fungus that produces it, but inhibits the growth of even closely related molds. This clearly indicates that terrein improves the competiveness of the producer. It will be exciting to learn how terrein is able to influence many different biological processes in different organisms, and how the producer protects itself against this molecule."
