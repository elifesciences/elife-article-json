New insights into the regulation of this pathway could reveal new therapeutic point of intervention, therefore are greatly needed. Here we report a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3\u03b2Y<sup>216</sup>/\u03b2-catenin regulation axis: FAK and PYK2, elevated in adenomas in <i>APC</i><sup>min/+</sup> mice and in human colorectal cancer tissues, functioned redundantly to promote the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> to reinforce pathway output-\u03b2-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. We previously showed that Wnt-induced \u03b2-catenin accumulation requires Wntinduced GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-TrCP interaction; the current study revealed that phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> was a molecular determinant of GSK3\u03b2 recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 suppressed adenoma formation in <i>APC</i><sup>min/+</sup> mice accompanied with reduced intestinal levels of phospho-SK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> and \u03b2-catenin, indicating that FAK/PYK2/GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in APCdriven intestinal tumorigenesis."
