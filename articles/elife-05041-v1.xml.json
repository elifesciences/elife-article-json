One population contributes to the formation of the skeleton during embryonic development, but quickly loses its stem cell potential after birth. The second population\u2014which is defined by the expression of a gene called <i>nestin</i>\u2014does not contribute to bone and cartilage formation during development, but becomes the only population with MSC activity after birth.

Isern et al. show that the skeleton-forming MSCs are derived from mesoderm tissue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The Nestin-positive MSCs, however, are derived from the neural crest; this is a short-lived population of cells in the ectoderm that gives rise to cells of the peripheral nervous system, as well as several other non-neural cell types. Additionally, Nestin-positive cells were found to include both MSCs and the precursors of Schwann cells (cells that wrap around and support nerve fibres). Schwann cell precursors can be distinguished from MSCs because they do not express a protein called \u2018platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1\u2019 (or PDGFR\u03b1), whereas MSCs do (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Shortly after birth, Nestin-negative bone marrow cells lose their ability to generate further mature cells. The neural crest develops from the ectoderm. Nestin-positive (or Nestin<sup>+</sup>) cells derived from the neural crest give rise to Nestin-positive MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells). The Nestin-positive cells also give rise to Schwann cell precursors, which develop into mature Schwann cells in the bone marrow of newborn mice (bottom). Both populations of cells work together with neural crest-derived sympathetic peripheral neurons to establish a three-part niche for HSCs (haematopoietic stem cells).

By deleting a gene critical to the migration of neural crest cells, they found that both Nestin-postive MSCs and Schwann cells fail to colonise the bone marrow. This, in turn, reduces the number of blood-forming progenitor cells that migrate to the bone marrow, which is a crucial step in the transition from foetal to adult blood formation. To confirm that these cells are important in establishing an HSC niche, Isern et al. also selectively deleted the Nestin-positive cells. This also prevented blood-forming progenitors from migrating to the bone marrow. Instead, the blood-forming progenitors were retained in the foetal liver where they are normally located prior to colonising the bone marrow."

As putative MSC populations have also been reported in multiple other tissues\u2014including skin, muscle and fat\u2014it will be interesting to see if this three-part niche supports other stem cell populations throughout the body."
