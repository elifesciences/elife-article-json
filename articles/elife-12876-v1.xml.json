NMD is essential for viability in most organisms, but the molecular basis for this requirement is unknown. Here we show that a single, conserved NMD target, the mRNA coding for the stress response factor Growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible 45 (GADD45) can account for lethality in <i>Drosophila</i> lacking core NMD genes. Moreover, depletion of <i>Gadd45</i> in mammalian cells rescues the cell survival defects associated with NMD knockdown. Our findings demonstrate that degradation of <i>Gadd45</i> mRNA is the essential NMD function and, surprisingly, that the surveillance of abnormal mRNAs by this pathway is not necessarily required for viability."
