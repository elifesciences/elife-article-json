The plasticity of the CRM1-NES interaction is not well understood, as there are many NES sequences that seem incompatible with structures of the NES-bound CRM1 groove. Crystal structures of CRM1 bound to two different NESs with unusual sequences showed the NES peptides binding the CRM1 groove in the opposite orientation (minus) to that of previously studied NESs (plus). Comparison of minus and plus NESs identified structural and sequence determinants for NES orientation. The binding of NESs to CRM1 in both orientations results in a large expansion in NES consensus patterns and therefore a corresponding expansion of potential NESs in the proteome."

The plasticity of the CRM1-NES interaction is not well understood, as there are many NES sequences that seem incompatible with structures of the NES-bound CRM1 groove. Crystal structures of CRM1 bound to two different NESs with unusual sequences showed the NES peptides binding the CRM1 groove in the opposite orientation (minus) to that of previously studied NESs (plus). Comparison of minus and plus NESs identified structural and sequence determinants for NES orientation. The binding of NESs to CRM1 in both orientations results in a large expansion in NES consensus patterns and therefore a corresponding expansion of potential NESs in the proteome."

This transport receptor helps to export hundreds of different proteins from the nucleus by recognizing a part of their structure called the \u2018nuclear export signal\u2019. Earlier work has shown that three different nuclear export signals interact with CRM1 in a similar ways by binding to a groove on its outer surface. But, there are several different types of nuclear export signal, and many are predicted to have three-dimensional structures that would seem to prevent them from binding to CRM1 in this way. As yet, it remains unknown how these diverse signals interact with this important transporter receptor."

First, a modified form of CRM1 was crystallized once it had bound to a small fragment of protein that contains a class 3 nuclear export signal. The protein's molecular structure was then revealed by performing X-ray diffraction on the crystals."

CRM1 maintains the cellular localization of hundreds of diverse-functioning protein cargos, including many tumor suppressor, cell cycle proteins, and viral proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fornerod et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fukuda et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 1997</a>). CRM1 is also a promising cancer drug target, and a small molecule inhibitor of CRM1 named Selinexor is currently in more than 40 clinical trials for a variety of cancers (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov\">clinicaltrials.gov</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lapalombella et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Etchin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fung and Chook, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). CRM1 recognizes its protein cargos through 8\u201315 residue long nuclear export signals (NESs) in the proteins (<a href=\"#bib28\">la Cour et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kosugi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). NES sequences are highly diverse, and the peptides bind CRM1 with a large affinity range, with dissociation constants (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>s) ranging from low nanomolar to tens of micromolar (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kutay and Guttinger, 2005</a>). Sequence, peptide-library, and bioinformatic analyses have found that NESs are best described by a set of six consensus sequences, which differ in the spacings between four key hydrophobic residues \u03a61, \u03a62, \u03a63, and \u03a64 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">la Cour et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kosugi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xu, Farmer et al., 2012a</a>).

The NESs bind in a hydrophobic groove, which is located on the outer/convex surface of the ring-shaped CRM1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Monecke et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">G\u00fcttler et al., 2010</a>). The NESs use almost exclusively their side chains, especially their hydrophobic \u03a6 side chains, to bind CRM1. The NES-binding groove of CRM1, which is wide at one end and narrow at the other end, consists of 5 hydrophobic pockets P0\u2013P4 and is virtually identical in all CRM1-NES structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). NESs from PKI and SNUPN (PKI<sup>NES</sup> and SNUPN<sup>NES</sup>) share a similar structure when bound to CRM1\u2014an N-terminal 3-turn \u03b1-helix followed by a short C-terminal \u03b2-strand-like extension (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Monecke et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">G\u00fcttler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Koyama et al., 2014</a>). The NES helix binds the wide part of the CRM1 groove, while the \u03b2-strand binds the narrow end of the groove. The Rev<sup>NES</sup> peptide binds the CRM1 groove in a different manner by adopting an entirely extended conformation (<a href=\"#bib20\">G\u00fcttler et al., 2010</a>). All three NES peptides bind in the same direction, with their N-termini at the wide part of the groove."

The repertoire of conformations for CRM1-bound NESs remains unclear, but the asymmetric and seemingly structurally invariant NES-bound CRM1 groove presents physical constraints on structures of bound NESs. For example, the class 3 NES consensus of \u03a61X<sub>(2,3)</sub>\u03a62X<sub>(2,3)</sub>\u03a63X<sub>2</sub>\u03a64 with two intervening residues between \u03a63 and \u03a64 suggests a single long NES helix. The substitution of a narrow strand or extended chain at the C-terminus of an NES with a helix presents a steric problem as the thicker helix is unlikely to fit into the tapering CRM1 groove. In current NES databases, class 3 NES sequences are as prevalent as NESs of classes 1b, 1c, 1d, and 2, but information of how they are able to bind CRM1 is missing (<a href=\"#bib49\">Xu et al., 2015</a>)."

Crystal structures of two different class 3 NESs bound to CRM1 revealed a novel NES binding mode where polypeptide direction of the NES is reversed. We show that NES peptides can bind the CRM1 groove bidirectionally (in both plus and minus directions), and biochemical and structural analyses identified determinants for one direction of binding vs the other. Bidirectional exportin-signal interactions suggest a significant expansion of the current NES consensus patterns that will enable new, previously unknown NESs to be identified."

This strategy was limited because of severe mosaicity of the CRM1-Ran-SNUPN crystals (<a href=\"#bib20\">G\u00fcttler et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, the ternary complex of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> CRM1 (<sup><i>Sc</i></sup>CRM1) with RanGTP (human or yeast RanGTP, Gsp1p) and RanBP1 (Yrb1p) reliably yields crystals that diffract to high resolution and has been used to determine structures of several CRM1-inhibitor complexes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koyama and Matsuura, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lapalombella et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Etchin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haines et al., 2015</a>).

Both plus and minus NES helices bind the same part of the CRM1 groove, with hydrophobic residues from one helix face occupying hydrophobic pockets P0\u2013P3 of CRM1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>). The structures show that the two minus NESs clearly match the consensus pattern \u03a61X\u03a62XXX\u03a63XX\u03a64XX\u03a65, which is the reverse of the class 1a pattern, \u03a60XX\u03a61XX\u03a62XXX\u03a63X\u03a64. The five hydrophobic residues of the hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>, designated \u03a61\u2013\u03a65, bind the same P0\u2013P4 pockets as the plus NESs, but in reverse order, with \u03a61 in P4 and \u03a65 in P0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>). The narrow part of the CRM1 groove is still occupied by an extended strand motif, which is formed by \u03a61 and \u03a62 of the minus NESs as they occupy the CRM1 P4 and P3 pockets, respectively. The hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> are in fact not class 3 NESs in the traditional sense, as the four previously designated \u03a6 residues in hRio2<sup>NES</sup> (<sup>389</sup>RSFE<span class=\"underline\">M</span>TE<span class=\"underline\">F</span>NQA<span class=\"underline\">L</span>EE<span class=\"underline\">I</span><sup>403</sup>) and the CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> (<sup>379</sup>RTFD<span class=\"underline\">M</span>HS<span class=\"underline\">L</span>ESS<span class=\"underline\">L</span>ID<span class=\"underline\">I</span><sup>393</sup>; predicted \u03a61\u2013\u03a64 positions are underlined) do not occupy the P1\u2013P4 hydrophobic pockets as predicted. The four hydrophobic residues that match the class 3 NES consensus, in fact form only a portion of an inverted class 1a pattern \u03a62XXX\u03a63XX\u03a64XX\u03a65, with M393 of hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and M383 of CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> in the \u03a62 positions. F391 of hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and F381 of CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>, which we had previously missed as consensus residues, are the \u03a61 positions of the N-terminal \u03a6X\u03a6 motif of an inverted class 1a pattern."

In an \u03b1-helix, amino acid side chains are angled toward the N-terminus of the helix.

To first investigate whether features of the sequence such as spacings between hydrophobic residues and placement of the \u03a6X\u03a6 motif are critical in determining directionality of NES binding, we reversed the sequence of the hRio2<sup>NES</sup> (<span class=\"underline\">F</span>E<span class=\"underline\">M</span>TE<span class=\"underline\">F</span>NQA<span class=\"underline\">L</span>EE<span class=\"underline\">I</span>) to generate hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R (<span class=\"underline\">I</span>EE<span class=\"underline\">L</span>AQN<span class=\"underline\">F</span>ET<span class=\"underline\">M</span>E<span class=\"underline\">F</span>).

Both reversed peptides match the class 1a NES pattern and were predicted to bind CRM1 like the PKI<sup>NES</sup>, which is another class 1a NES. Binding affinities of NES peptides to CRM1 were measured in competition differential bleaching experiments using FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup> as a fluorescent probe, MBP-NESs as competitors and monitored with a microscale thermophoresis instrument (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

These structures show the peptides binding in the plus direction, that is, opposite that of their wild-type counterparts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The CRM1 grooves in the hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R complexes are almost identical to those in the wild-type hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> complexes (C\u03b1 rmsds 0.2\u20130.3 \u00c5). The N-terminal helices of hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R that span \u03a60\u2013\u03a63 bind CRM1 much like the helix of the plus direction PKI<sup>NES</sup>. Their C-terminal strand-like \u03a6X\u03a6 segments bind in the narrow part of the CRM1 groove, but are placed slightly outward toward solvent, perhaps to better accommodate the large Phe and Met side chains in the P3 and P4 CRM1 pockets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Pull-down assays with single amino acid mutants of hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R reveal that smaller hydrophobic residues such as leucine in the \u03a63 position and isoleucine, leucine, and valine in the \u03a64 position are preferred for binding to CRM1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The preference for smaller hydrophobic side chains in \u03a6X\u03a6 segment can possibly be explained by the relief of steric constraints caused by the bulky phenylalanine in the native hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R sequence. The structures of CRM1-bound hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R peptides support the idea that the spacing between the hydrophobic residues is critical for determining the orientation the NES binds. When the sequence and the hydrophobic spacing pattern of an NES are reversed, the direction of the peptide binding CRM1 is also reversed. However, binding affinities of the NESs are similar regardless of binding orientation, consistent with the observation that hydrophobic interactions between the CRM1 groove and side chains in the \u03a6 positions of hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>, which likely govern CRM1-NES affinity, are preserved in hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R."

Each of the asymmetric class 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d patterns, which represent plus NESs, could be reversed to give class 1a-R, 1b-R, 1c-R, and 1d-R patterns that represent minus NESs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In principle, symmetric class 2 and 3 patterns can also bind CRM1 in both the plus and minus directions. For example, the class 2 Rev<sup>NES</sup> binds CRM1 in the plus direction as an entirely extended chain, but it is also possible that hydrophobic side chains of another class 2 NES can be presented from a similar extended peptide in the minus direction. However, it remains to be determined whether any of the currently known class 2 and true class 3 peptides can indeed bind in the minus direction. Expansion of NES consensus by reversing class 1 NES consensus patterns to generate class 1-R patterns further suggests a corresponding increase of potential NESs in the proteome."

Dbase reports a total of 290 experimentally identified NES regions for the 246 CRM1 cargos in the database. Matches for both class 1 (plus) and class 1-R (minus) patterns appear to be similarly prevalent in the 246 CRM1 cargos (1849 minus vs 1950 plus matches) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

The bias for plus patterns in these previously reported NES regions may be a consequence of NES searches that were guided solely by the plus consensus patterns, since the minus patterns were unknown. The Dbase data set is further complicated by a lack of validation of direct CRM1-NES interactions. Only 60% of previously reported class 1 NESs that were tested recently were found to actually bind CRM1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Xu et al., 2012a</a>). Of the 290 NES regions in Dbase, 40% (116) contain sequences that match both class 1 (plus) and class 1-R (minus) patterns (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). 89 NES regions match class 1 pattern exclusively and 24 match class 1-R patterns exclusively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), suggesting that there are still a significant population of putative minus NES even though the current NES annotation is biased and imperfect."

The remaining 20 NES regions contain 22 sequences that match class 1-R patterns, which were tested for CRM1 binding in pull-down assays. Of the 22 sequences tested, one degraded and another aggregated during purification resulting in only 20 relevant NES sequences. 10 out of the 20 putative minus NESs, or 50%, bind CRM1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This percentage is similar to the proportion of tested class 1 (plus) NESs that bind CRM1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Xu et al., 2012a</a>). These results suggest that there are a substantial number of functional NESs that likely bind CRM1 in the minus direction, even in an NES dataset like Dbase where many NESs were previously identified using the only plus NES consensus patterns. These possibly include cases where NES patterns have been mistakenly annotated or annotated as previously non-canonical patterns. This new expansion of NES consensus provides a means to identify previously unrecognizable NESs in previously identified and new CRM1 cargos."

Side chain to side chain distances within secondary structural elements of motifs are preserved regardless of polypeptide orientation, thus producing a feature that may be conducive for binding in opposite orientations. The required shift of the backbone to put the plus and minus side chains in the same position is more likely for linear motifs than for extensive interfaces between two folded proteins, since the latter are constrained by many additional contacts outside of the helix-binding groove. Thus, bidirectional recognition is probably more prevalent in recognition of linear helical motifs than in recognition of larger structured elements."

Here, side chains, mainly the phosphotyrosine side chain, contribute the majority of binding energy, which can still be preserved when peptide orientation is reversed. Linear motifs that use mostly side chains for binding may be amenable to interactions in opposite orientations but those that make extensive contacts using their backbones may be limited to a particular orientation. For example, the IBB region of Importin-\u03b1, which is the nuclear localization signal or NLS that binds directly to Importin-\u03b2, is a long 28-residue helix that is preceded by a loop (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cingolani et al., 1999</a>). The IBB uses mostly charged and polar side chains to interact with Importin-\u03b2, and perhaps these side chain interactions could be preserved when polypeptide direction of the NLS peptide is flipped. Similarly, PY-NLS binding to Karyopherin-\u03b22 (also known as Transportin-1) involves mostly the NLS side chains, and we may observe these NLSs binding to Karyopherin-\u03b22 in the opposite orientation in the future (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Soniat et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, the classical-NLS recognition by Importin-\u03b1 and the Kap121-specific lysine-rich NLS (also called the IK-NLS) recognition by Kap121 involve extensive interactions with the NLS main chains and are therefore less likely to bind bidirectionally to their importins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Conti et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fontes et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kobayashi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Soniat and Chook, 2015</a>).

These protein\u2013peptide interaction systems are relatively free of spatial constraints compared to systems that bind organelle-targeting signals for delivery into membrane compartments. An example of the latter is the binding of ER signal sequences by the signal recognition particle SRP, which is likely constrained spatially by the nascent chain emerging from the ribosome and by subsequent delivery into the lumen of the translocon (<a href=\"#bib22\">Janda et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Akopian et al., 2013</a>). In principle, linear motifs that could bind in both orientations are sometimes constrained by other factors that limit them to only one. The CRM1-NES interaction is free from such spatial constraints as the entire exportin\u2013cargo complex enters the nuclear pore complex for transport to the cytoplasm, thereby allowing some NESs to bind CRM1 in the plus orientation and others in the minus orientation."

Many functional NES-containing regions of proteins contain multiple NES consensus matches and sometimes no NES match, suggesting that the set of NES consensus does not provide sufficient coverage for NES identification. Our study shows that structures of NESs bound to CRM1 can accurately define consensus patterns and sometimes identify new consensus patterns. Expansion of the NES consensus upon discovery of minus NESs leads to improved coverage of potential NESs, thus allowing identification of previously unrecognized NESs in known and new CRM1 cargos. However, the improved coverage afforded by the knowledge of bidirectional NES-binding is largely orthogonal to the problems in NES prediction that arise from false positive NESs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xu et al., 2012a</a>). The majority of the NES patterns describe the ubiquitous 2-turn amphipathic helix, which are found in most helix-containing proteins, and many of these consensus-matching sequences are part of hydrophobic cores that are not accessible for CRM1 binding. In the development of NES predictors (NESsential by the Horton Lab and LocNES by the Chook lab, <a href=\"#bib17\">Fu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Xu et al., 2015</a>), we found that prediction accuracy was improved by using both sequence and structural/biophysical properties (such as disorder propensity and/or solvent accessibility) as features for machine-learning methods. The latter features allowed consensus-matching sequences in the interior of folded domains to be flagged. A set of consensus sequences with high coverage rate such as the expanded set in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> is desirable when employed as a pre-filter in NES prediction as the machine-learning process that follows serves to reduce false positive matches. Future identification of minus NESs will also increase the size, diversity, and accuracy of experimental NES databases, which are the training/testing data sets for the development of our next generation NES predictors."

A C-terminal \u03a6X\u03a6 motif that follows a helix dictates a plus NES, while an N-terminal \u03a6X\u03a6 followed by a helix results in a minus NES. The five hydrophobic pockets in the CRM1-NES groove interact with hydrophobic side chains that are presented in many different ways on NES peptides, by different secondary structural elements and in both polypeptide chain directions, to enable specific recognition of diverse NES sequences."

                                "text": "Differential bleaching was used as a parameter to monitor binding of MBP-NES proteins to CRM1. In short, we observed that the fluorophore reporter attached to PKI<sup>NES</sup> (FITC) underwent a reproducible time-dependent bleaching when exposed to excitation light (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, this phenomenon was concentration-dependent, that is, the bleaching was accelerated when the FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup> probe was exposed to increasing concentrations of CRM1. However, this phenomenon was saturable at high concentrations of CRM1, indicating that it was a function of CRM1 binding and not simply the presence of the protein that was causing the change. The differential bleaching can be counteracted by titrating of mixture of FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup> and CRM1 with a known competitor, MBP-PKI<sup>NES</sup>, which competes directly with the fluorescent probe for the NES binding groove in CRM1. A sigmoidal appearance of the binding and competition isotherms is observed when differential bleaching, quantified as the average fluorescence at a time after bleaching normalized by the averaged fluorescence just after the beginning of bleaching, is plotted vs titrant concentration in a semilog graph (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).This illustrates that this bleaching behavior can be described as a two-state system where unbound probe and CRM1-bound probe bleach at different but specific rates, and that these quantities report on the populations of bound and unbound FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup>. A detailed description of the data-fitting procedures will be described in manuscript in preparation by C.A.B. For error reporting, we used F-statistics and error-surface projection method to calculate the 68.3% confidence intervals of the fitted data (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bevington and Robinson, 1992</a>). While error reporting using the error surface projection method is relatively uncommon, the ranges more accurately represent the true confidence intervals given the observed noise in the performed set of experiments because they explicitly account for the ability of the fitting algorithm to compensate for fitting defects by modifying correlated parameters. Thus, they provide better evaluation of the fitted data than other, more commonly used methods (e.g., error estimations from the parametric variance-covariance matrix)."

All protein sequences in the Dbase data set were first compiled along with their annotated NES regions into an in-house database implemented by MySQL (version 5.5.43) on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04). NES regions are defined according to original reports in the published literature that identified the CRM1 cargos. PHP (version 5.3) regular expression with look-ahead assertions was used to capture all sequences (including overlapping sequences) that match the eight different class 1 (plus) and class 1-R (minus) NES consensus patterns. Duplicate matches (such as 10-mer sequences that simultaneously match both class 1a and 1d patterns, or match both 1a-R and 1d-R patterns) were removed using Linux command line tools, and the resulting numbers of consensus matches (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) were used for the enrichment test of plus consensus patterns within NES regions by Chi-square test using R (version 2.14.1). The same MySQL database was used to search for putative minus NESs, and 24 NES regions that match the 1-R patterns exclusively were identified. Four of these NES regions were removed because of overlap with class 2 patterns, resulting in 20 NES regions (containing 22 1-R consensus matches) for examination of CRM1 interactions by pull-down binding assays."

The typical hydrophobic spacing in these new signals differ from the crystallographically defined mechanism of recognition of protein kinase-A inhibitor (PKI), and using x-ray crystallography, the authors find that the orientation of the new CRM1s are reversed (N to C) when bound to the pocket. In retrospect, bidirectional recognition of NES is not surprising if one considers that CRM1 does not make contacts with the NES main-chain, unlike importins (e.g. Importin-\u03b1, \u03b2, etc.) that make extensive contacts with the NLS backbone, hence forcing the NLS side chains in an orientation-dependent conformation. The authors then deduce the spacing rules for orientation, and show that they can reverse the orientation of both PKI, and the Rio2 and PKI sequences. The authors also define specificities of hydrophobic binding residues qualitatively using pull-down assays. Finally, using their modified sequence profile, they identify a new potential set of sequences and show that a significant subset of them bind. Overall, this is an interesting and fairly complete study that is important to understand nuclear export and molecular recognition. It should have broad interest, from cell biologists to biophysicists."

The chances that such sequences will appear in random sequence (and non-import sequences) are quite high.

The authors should comment about these false positives, and how likely they are to influence their numbers. Would it be possible if additional criteria can be included in improve the prediction power? For example, the predicted NESs should not be a part of folded protein structure."

Minus NESs do not appear to be systematically weaker binders compared to plus NES.

In those studies, we incorporated disorder prediction into our NES predictors, NESsential and LocNES, such that NES candidates are deemed less probable NESs if not located in disordered regions of proteins. We have revised the current manuscript to include a summary of our work on NES prediction (Discussion) where the use of sequence patterns along with incorporation of biophysical/structural properties such as disorder propensity and predicted solvent accessibility have significantly improved NES prediction. However, the prediction accuracy of our most recent and best NES predictor (LocNES) is still far from ideal (<a href=\"#bib49\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). We have observed that structural information of CRM1 cargos can be useful to exclude NES candidates that reside within folded domains and thus are most likely inaccessible to CRM1. We plan to include more 3D structural information into our NES prediction schemes as more PDB entries of CRM1 cargos become available and modeling of 3D structures becomes more facile. In the meantime, we rephrased the Discussion accordingly (\u201cFinally, accurate prediction of NESs has been difficult [\u2026] are the training/testing datasets for the development of our next generation NES predictors)."
