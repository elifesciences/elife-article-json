                    "text": "Neurotransmitter is released at synapses by fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. To sustain synaptic transmission, compensatory retrieval of membranes and vesicular proteins is essential. We combined capacitance measurements and pH-imaging via pH-sensitive vesicular protein marker (anti-synaptotagmin2-cypHer5E), and compared the retrieval kinetics of membranes and vesicular proteins at the calyx of Held synapse. Membrane and Syt2 were retrieved with a similar time course when slow endocytosis was elicited. When fast endocytosis was elicited, Syt2 was still retrieved together with the membrane, but endocytosed organelle re-acidification was slowed down, which provides strong evidence for two distinct endocytotic pathways. Strikingly, CaM inhibitors or the inhibition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-Munc13-1 signaling pathway only impaired the uptake of Syt2 while leaving membrane retrieval intact, indicating different recycling mechanisms for membranes and vesicle proteins. Our data identify a novel mechanism of stimulus- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of coordinated endocytosis of synaptic membranes and vesicle proteins."

To sustain synaptic transmission, compensatory retrieval of membranes and vesicular proteins is essential. We combined capacitance measurements and pH-imaging via pH-sensitive vesicular protein marker (anti-synaptotagmin2-cypHer5E), and compared the retrieval kinetics of membranes and vesicular proteins at the calyx of Held synapse. Membrane and Syt2 were retrieved with a similar time course when slow endocytosis was elicited. When fast endocytosis was elicited, Syt2 was still retrieved together with the membrane, but endocytosed organelle re-acidification was slowed down, which provides strong evidence for two distinct endocytotic pathways. Strikingly, CaM inhibitors or the inhibition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-Munc13-1 signaling pathway only impaired the uptake of Syt2 while leaving membrane retrieval intact, indicating different recycling mechanisms for membranes and vesicle proteins. Our data identify a novel mechanism of stimulus- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of coordinated endocytosis of synaptic membranes and vesicle proteins."

The cell surface area was also measured, and the experiments focused on a fluorescently tagged version of a vesicle protein called Synaptotagmin2 that could be tracked under a microscope. Okamoto et al. found that, in weakly active nerve cells, the vesicle membrane and Synaptotagmin2 were retrieved together at a slow rate. The process was faster in more active nerve cells, and Synaptotagmin2 was still retrieved with the membrane but it appeared to be stored first in larger sacs. This suggests that membrane and vesicle proteins may be retrieved via two distinct modes depending on the activity strength. The results of further experiments went on to suggest that vesicle membranes might be recycled in a different way from vesicle proteins."

Fast endocytosis with a time constant of less than few seconds, is seen when a strong stimulus is applied (<a href=\"#bib74\">Xue et al., 2012</a>), and often involves excess membrane retrieval. In contrast, slow endocytosis, which is a major form of endocytosis, has a time constant of seconds to tens of seconds, and at a variety of synapses, the amount of membrane endocytosed in this manner is similar to the amount of membrane that had previously been exocytosed (<a href=\"#bib65\">von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Moser and Beutner, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sun and Wu, 2001</a>).

Except for kiss-and-run events, retrieval of vesicular proteins seems to be slow, with a time constant of seconds to tens of seconds, similar to the time constant of membrane retrieval during slow endocytosis as assessed by capacitance measurements.

The 200\u2009\u03bcm transverse brainstem slices were incubated for 30\u2009min in a high potassium solution (32.5\u2009mM) containing anti-Syt2-cypHer (0.01 mg/ml) to depolarize the terminals and induce exocytosis followed by endocytosis, in which the anti-Syt2-cypHer is internalized (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The fluorescence of the cypHer dye is almost quenched at the neutral extracellular pH of 7.4 after SV exocytosis and is almost maximal at the intravesicular pH of 5.5 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hua et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, the cup-shaped structures observed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> can be assumed to be calyx terminals filled with anti-Syt2-cypHer-containing internalized vesicles. The staining was calyx specific in this region, and anti-Syt2-cypHer showed a stimulus dependent fluorescence change when field stimulations were applied (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hua et al., 2011</a>). Anti-Syt2-cypHer exposed to the membrane surface is barely fluorescent, so that background fluorescence is kept low even in a slice preparation. To measure the kinetics of Syt2 and plasma membrane recycling simultaneously, labeled calyx terminals were whole-cell voltage clamped, and the membrane capacitance and the cypHer signal were measured. When the terminal was stimulated with a train (10 times, 200 ms intervals) of depolarization pulses (0 mV for 50 ms following a prepulse to +70 mV for 2 ms), large capacitance jumps caused by exocytosis were observed (1.52 \u00b1 0. 21 pF after 10 pulses, n = 7, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). A 50 ms pulse is sufficient to deplete the readily-releasable pool of SVs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hosoi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yamashita et al., 2010</a>), and the following pulses mainly reflect release of newly-replenished SVs at release sites. The capacitance decayed bi-exponentially with two time constants of a few seconds (\u03c4 = 5.2\u2009s, 37% ) and tens of seconds (\u03c4 = 66.5\u2009s, 63% ), reflecting clathrin-independent and dependent endocytosis, respectively (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yamashita et al., 2010</a>). During the recording, we also measured the fluorescence of the cypHer signal. The cypHer fluorescence showed a rapid decrease upon stimulation, followed by a slow recovery (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The time course of fluorescence change reflects the kinetics of exocytosis and subsequent endocytosis. To compare the time course of membrane capacitance traces and cypHer fluorescence traces, we inverted the cypHer traces. Comparison of the recovery time course of the capacitance traces and the cypHer traces showed that both returned to ~0.4 of the peak value after 60\u2009s (C<sub>m</sub>, 0.33 \u00b1 0.06, n =\u00a07; F, 0.47 \u00b1 0.07, n = 10, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Two notable features are revealed by comparing capacitance and cypHer measurements: (1) C<sub>m</sub> had a rapid decay component whereas cypHer signals did not (see also <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. below); (2) CypHer signals showed a delay in the decay phase as compared with the decay of the capacitance values. The delayed recovery of cypHer signal is consistent with reports showing that acidification of glutamatergic SVs occurs with a time constant of tens of seconds (<a href=\"#bib15\">Egashira et al., 2015</a>, but see <a href=\"#bib3\">Atluri and Ryan, 2006</a>). Fitting of the recovery time course of the cypHer signal was optimal when we assumed a re-acidification time constant of 38.7\u2009s and a 14\u2009s delay of onset after membrane retrieval (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The asymptotic value (extrapolated from the exponential fit) of the fluorescence recovery (0.13 from <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) was similar to that of the capacitance trace (0.12 from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), which indicated that the rate of endocytosis becomes as low as that of re-acidification. The exponential decay time constant was more clearly seen by taking longer recordings (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that exocytosed Syt2 is almost completely retrieved."

To verify this, we compared the magnitude of the capacitance jumps with the amplitude of cypHer fluorescence to see whether they correlate linearly. We applied four consecutive 50 ms depolarizing pulses with 20\u2009s intervals, and simultaneously measured the size of the capacitance jumps and the cypHer fluorescence change. With this protocol, capacitance jumps showed a gradual decrease because of incomplete recovery of the readily releasable vesicle pool between the stimuli (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The amplitudes of the cypHer signal also showed gradual decrease (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). When the normalized amplitudes of capacitance jumps and fluorescence decrease were compared, we found similar levels of depression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). This result indicates that the membrane capacitance changes and the changes in cypHer fluorescence amplitudes correlate linearly, even under conditions of a slight change in the extent of exocytosis (~20% ), and that the cypHer labeling of the vesicles is homogenous."

This mode of endocytosis retrieves the plasma membrane extremely fast, which can be read out as a rapid membrane capacitance decay after the exocytotic capacitance jump, and often shows an undershoot (<a href=\"#bib52\">Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wu et al., 2009</a>).

The membrane capacitance showed a large jump upon the stimulation (&gt;1 pF, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, left), and decayed rapidly after the stimulation, which is consistent with previous studies. This fast mode of endocytosis is shown to be insensitive to dynamin inhibition (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yamashita et al., 2010</a>, but see <a href=\"#bib73\">Xu et al., 2008</a>), as in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> fast component, suggesting the same mechanism. On the contrary, the cypHer signal barely showed a recovery (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, right). The discrepancy was more clearly seen when we compared the averaged traces of membrane capacitance and cypHer signal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This is different from the results obtained with trains of ten 50 ms depolarizations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), where membrane capacitance and cypHer signal decayed with more similar time courses. In fact, the recovery time course of cypHer signal after the 2\u2009s depolarization was even slower than after trains of ten 50 ms depolarizations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, 40\u00a0s after the stimulus; 50 ms x 10, 0.70 \u00b1 0.04, n = 10; 2\u2009s, 0.93 \u00b1 0.07, n = 9, p=0.019). To explain the delayed cypHer signal recovery after the 2\u2009s depolarization condition, we considered two possibilities: (i) the anti-Syt2-cypHer was not retrieved together with the endocytosed membrane and left behind at the plasma membrane surface, or (ii) the anti-Syt2-cypHer was retrieved via endocytosed organelles, but the intra-organelle pH was not (or barely) re-acidified after endocytosis. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we briefly (5\u2009s) applied an acidic solution (pH 5.5) extracellularly before (20\u2009s) and after (40\u2009s) the stimulation to de-quench the surface-exposed anti-Syt2-cypHer. In the 2\u2009s pulse condition, membrane retrieval assessed by capacitance measurements is essentially completed 40\u2009s after the stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). If the anti-Syt2-cypHer were taken up into the endocytosed organelle, there should be no difference in the amount of de-quenching before and after the stimulation. On the other hand, the amount of de-quenching should be higher after stimulation if anti-Syt2-cypHer were not taken up and left behind at the plasma membrane. We found (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>) that the amount of de-quenching was not different before or after the stimulation (pre, 0.40 \u00b1 0.16; post, 0.41 \u00b1 0.10, n = 5, p=0.66), indicating that anti-Syt2-cypHer was retrieved via endocytosed organelles, but was not (or barely) re-acidified. The lack of re-acidification in the newly endocytosed organelles after a 2\u2009s depolarization can be explained if the membrane endocytosis occurred as bulk endocytosis, which is seen after strong stimulation of the calyx terminal (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Lange et al., 2003</a>). Longer post-stimulus recordings showed a sign of cypHer signal recovery (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is consistent with the idea that anti-Syt2-cypHer is initially taken up via larger endosomal-like structure formed by bulk endocytosis, followed by slow re-acidification due to the larger volume-to-surface ratio."

It remains possible that a higher concentration of CaM inhibitor is required to inhibit membrane retrieval itself (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sun et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). To test if the slower recovery of the cypHer signal was caused by slower protein retrieval or else by slower re-acidification, we performed an acidic solution (pH 5.5) perfusion experiment as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>. We applied acidic solution before (20\u2009s) and after (40\u2009s) the train of ten 50 ms depolarizations under control conditions in the absence (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) or presence of CaM inhibitory peptide (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

The small increase in the post \u0394F / pre \u0394F ratio under control condition is caused by incomplete membrane retrieval 40\u2009s after the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Because the time course of membrane retrieval was similar for both control and CaM inhibitory peptide conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), this result indicates that anti-Syt2-cypHer was left behind at the plasma membrane surface in the presence of CaM inhibitory peptide. Thus, CaM may play a crucial role in coordinated retrieval of Syt2 together with the endocytosed membrane."

Recordings from WT mouse calyx terminals showed that the time course of cypHer signal recovery was similar to that of membrane capacitance retrieval (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Fits based on the assumption of re-acidification with an exponential time constant of 18.9\u2009s after membrane retrieval and a 12\u2009s delay of onset described the actual recovery of the cypHer signal very well (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In many studies, it was assumed that the kinetics of the fluorescence changes represent endocytosis, including both, membrane and labeled protein retrieval. By directly comparing the kinetics of membrane and anti-Syt2-cypHer retrieval, we show here that this assumption is essentially correct at the calyx of Held presynaptic terminal when the stimulation intensity is mild. Under this condition, endocytosis is operates mainly by a slow, clathrin-dependent mode (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yamashita et al., 2010</a>). The time course of cypHer signal recovery under this condition was slightly slower than that of the capacitance recovery, but the difference can be well described by taking the re-acidification time course (20\u2009s ~ 40\u2009s) into account. This is longer than recent reports showing that the re-acidification time course of glutamatergic vesicles takes 15 s in cultured hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Egashira et al., 2015</a>). In some studies, even faster re-acidification time courses were suggested (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Atluri and Ryan, 2006</a>). One of the possibilities that may cause the slow re-acidification time course was relatively large size of the synaptic vesicles in the calyx terminal (50 nm, <a href=\"#bib59\">S\u00e4tzler et al., 2002</a>). These vesicles may contain up to 5,000\u20137,000 glutamate molecules. Recently, <a href=\"#bib10\">Cho and von Gersdorff. (2014)</a> reported that vesicular glutamate may function as a buffer for vesicle protons. So a larger vesicle may contain many hundreds to thousands of protons and its acidification may take a relatively long time. However, the time constant for single vesicle glutamate filling at the calyx of Held is estimated to be 15 s (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hori and Takahashi, 2012</a>). In our train stimulation protocol, 37% of membrane retrieval was mediated by fast endocytosis, thus larger endosome-like structure might also contribute to the slower re-acidification time course. It may be possible that Syt2 remains stranded in the plasma membrane for ~15\u2009s and then a partial contribution of larger endosome-like structure is needed (bulk endocytosis) to explain the 38.7\u2009s decay time constant (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure\u00a01\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Usually, clathrin-dependent, slow endocytosis is observed after mild stimulation, but in these pHluorin-based studies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armbruster et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2004</a>), endocytosis-based signal recovery was still slow (tens of seconds) even with strong stimulation, which elicits clathrin-independent endocytosis. In contrast, capacitance measurements and electron microscopic studies showed that clathrin-independent endocytosis, i.e. either bulk endocytosis or ultrafast endocytosis, occurs in the range of tens of ms to seconds (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jockusch et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Watanabe et al., 2013</a>). Fast endocytosis in the present study (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) reflects clathrin-independent endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Lange et al., 2003</a>), and by providing a direct comparison of membrane uptake, vesicle protein uptake, and re-acidification of endocytosed organelles, our results reconcile the previously reported, apparent discrepancy in the kinetics of endocytosis as assessed by pHluorin probes vs. capacitance measurements and electron microscopic analyses. Our data demonstrate that the retrieval of vesicle membrane and vesicle proteins occurs simultaneously, but that re-acidification of the endocytosed organelle is slow after clathrin-independent, fast endocytosis. This is likely due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of the endosome-like structures that form during fast endocytosis and/or to slow budding of vesicles from such endosomes (<a href=\"#bib67\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kononenko et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</a>)"

This suggests that membrane retrieval and sorting of SV proteins can be segregated. Our results are consistent with this notion, and the two processes can be separated in the presence of a CaM inhibitor or in Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> calyces (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>).

For three reasons, our results do not necessarily contradict these calcineurin data. First, it is possible that the complex between CaM and calcineurin is so tight that higher concentrations of CaM inhibitors are required to block the function of calcineurin in membrane retrieval. Second, the effect of calmodulin blockers on membrane retrieval can be seen when low concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers are present in the presynaptic patch pipette, which lead to a strong elevation of the global presynaptic calcium concentration (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wu et al., 2014</a>), but not when high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers are used as in the present study (see Materials and methods). Third, a CaM-independent component of membrane retrieval might exist. All this notwithstanding, our results suggest that CaM has several downstream targets that regulate the retrieval of membrane and proteins."

We found in this context that re-acidification barely occurs 1\u2009min after a 2\u2009s depolarization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), which suggests that vesicle budding from endosome-like organelles is slow (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheung et al., 2010</a>). Our results also suggest that Syt2 is retrieved together with the membrane not only in the slow, but also in the fast mode of endocytosis, but the molecular mechanism of Syt2 sorting during bulk endocytosis remains to be elucidated."

This is somewhat surprising since Munc13-1 is a well-known vesicle priming factor at the active zone. In this context, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc13-1 signaling pathway regulates the recovery rate of the pool of releasable SVs in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Junge et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lipstein et al., 2012</a>) and in the calyx of Held terminal (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lipstein et al., 2013</a>), likely by enhancing the replenishment rate of synaptic vesicles. However, the effect of dynamin inhibition, which perturbs endocytosis, on the SV replenishment rate (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hosoi et al., 2009</a>) is very similar to the effect measured in the Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> KI calyces (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), and to that of acute pharmacological blockade of CaM (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</a>). Because the effects of perturbed endocytosis on vesicle pool recovery can be explained by delayed clearance of active zone release sites from the remains of molecular complexes formed by the preceding fusion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hosoi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kawasaki et al., 2000</a>), or by impaired structural recovery after the preceding exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wu et al., 2009</a>) in addition to priming of synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib44\">Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2015</a>), and based on the results of our present study, we propose that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc-13 complex does not only act in the regulation of SV replenishment but is also involved in release site clearance. The corresponding roles of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc-13 complex might be dependent on or independent of each other. The total amount of exocytosis evoked by a train of ten 50 ms stimuli was smaller in Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> KI calyces as compared to WT controls, but the amount of exocytosis elicited by the first pulse in the train was not different (data not shown), which is consistent with a previous study showing slower SV replenishment at release sites in Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> KI calyces (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lipstein et al., 2013</a>)."

Disruption of exocytotic proteins such as SNAREs affects endocytosis, which suggests a close coupling between exo- and endocytotic processes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hosoi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Syt1 is needed for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in chromaffin cells (<a href=\"#bib78\">Yao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">McAdam et al., 2015</a>), and inhibition of Syt2 interaction to AP2 blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis in calyx terminals (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hosoi et al., 2009</a>). Also, genetic deletion of SV proteins perturbs endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nicholson-Tomishima and Ryan, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">De\u00e1k et al., 2004</a>). One possible molecular scenario is that the core complex of the release machinery, composed of SNAREs, Munc13s, Munc18s, and synaptotagmin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Betz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ma et al., 2013</a>), has to be disassembled before endocytosis, and that without a functional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc13-1 pathway, exocytosed Syt2 might be harder to dissociate from the release complex, so that Syt2 translocation to the endocytotic sites is retarded, causing a molecular jam at the active zone. It will be interesting to examine whether the uptake of other proteins involved in the vesicle fusion complex are also regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc13-1 signaling."

This might be particularly relevant in the calyx of Held, which has to cope with high-frequency transmission (<a href=\"#bib61\">Taschenberger et al., 2002</a>) and where Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation boosts proper SV sorting and replenishment, but other synapses may employ the same regulatory mechanism. So far, the calyx of Held terminal is the most convenient neuronal presynaptic terminal for capacitance measurements, but recently several other neuronal presynaptic terminals, where genetic manipulations are better feasible, were shown to be amenable to capacitance recordings (e.g. hippocampal mossy fiber terminals, <a href=\"#bib22\">Hallermann et al., 2003</a>; cerebellar mossy fiber boutons, <a href=\"#bib13\">Delvendahl et al., 2015</a>; cultured cerebellar Purkinje cell, <a href=\"#bib32\">Kawaguchi and Sakaba, 2015</a>).

Atluri and Ryan (JNeurosci., 2006) estimated a time constant of 4 -5 seconds (at room temperature) and Gandhi and Stevens (Nature, 2003) estimated a time constant of 0.4 seconds. So the time constant of 30 seconds after a 10 s delay that the authors estimate is very surprising and seems very slow. On the other hand, synaptic vesicles in the calyx of Held are quite large (50 nm diameter) and may contain up to 5000-7000 glutamate molecules. Recently, Cho and v. Gersdorff (JNeurosci., 2014) reported that vesicular glutamate may function as a buffer for vesicle protons. So a larger vesicle may contain many hundreds to thousands of protons and its acidification may take a relatively long time. However, the time constant for single vesicle glutamate filling at the calyx of Held is estimated to be 15 seconds (Hori and Takahashi, Neuron, 2012). Please comment on this previous result. In conclusion, it seems that Syt2 remains stranded in the plasma membrane for 10 s and then a larger endosome-like structure is needed (bulk endocytosis) to explain the very slow 30 s decay time constant. All these references should be briefly discussed and cited in the Discussion and the authors should mention in the Abstract or Introduction this surprising finding of the 10 s delay followed by a 30 s decay time constant for reacidification."

If the bold orange line is the best fit it would suggest that the hypothesis might be wrong because the best match (bold orange) does not seem to be a good fit, a straight line would do much better. The analysis needs clarification and/or further analysis.</i>"

With similar train stimulation protocol that we used in this work (20ms x 10 depolarization at 10 Hz), Wu et al.

Atluri and Ryan (JNeurosci., 2006) estimated a time constant of 4-5 seconds (at room temperature) and Gandhi and Stevens (Nature, 2003) estimated a time constant of 0.4 seconds. So the time constant of 30 seconds after a 10 s delay that the authors estimate is very surprising and seems very slow. On the other hand, synaptic vesicles in the calyx of Held are quite large (50 nm diameter) and may contain up to 5000-7000 glutamate molecules. Recently, Cho and v. Gersdorff (JNeurosci., 2014) reported that vesicular glutamate may function as a buffer for vesicle protons. So a larger vesicle may contain many hundreds to thousands of protons and its acidification may take a relatively long time. However, the time constant for single vesicle glutamate filling at the calyx of Held is estimated to be 15 seconds (Hori and Takahashi, Neuron, 2012). Please comment on this previous result. In conclusion, it seems that Syt2 remains stranded in the plasma membrane for 10 s and then a larger endosome-like structure is needed (bulk endocytosis) to explain the very slow 30 s decay time constant. All these references should be briefly discussed and cited in the Discussion and the authors should mention in the Abstract or Introduction this surprising finding of the 10 s delay followed by a 30 s decay time constant for reacidification.</i>"
