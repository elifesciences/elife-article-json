This is true when the copy number of individual genes or entire chromosomes is altered. In a recent study, Hose et al. (2015) reported that this tight correlation between gene copy number and RNA levels is not observed in recently isolated wild <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> variants. To understand the origins of this proposed difference in gene expression regulation between natural variants and laboratory strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, we evaluated the karyotype and gene expression studies performed by Hose et al. on wild <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains. In contrast to the results of Hose et al., our reexamination of their data revealed a tight correlation between gene copy number and gene expression. We conclude that widespread dosage compensation occurs neither in laboratory strains nor in natural variants of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>."

This is true when the copy number of individual genes or entire chromosomes is altered. In a recent study, Hose et al. (2015) reported that this tight correlation between gene copy number and RNA levels is not observed in recently isolated wild <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> variants. To understand the origins of this proposed difference in gene expression regulation between natural variants and laboratory strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, we evaluated the karyotype and gene expression studies performed by Hose et al. on wild <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains. In contrast to the results of Hose et al., our reexamination of their data revealed a tight correlation between gene copy number and gene expression. We conclude that widespread dosage compensation occurs neither in laboratory strains nor in natural variants of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>."

Gene expression studies in budding yeast, fission yeast, mammalian cells, and plants revealed that this is due to the fact that changes in gene copy number result in changes in gene expression (<a href=\"#bib1\">Chikashige et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Huettel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Pavelka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Sheltzer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Stingele et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Torres et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">2007</a>). For example, in haploid budding yeast strains harboring single chromosome gains, RNA levels of more than 90% of genes located on the extra chromosome reflect the increased gene copy number (<a href=\"#bib3\">Dephoure et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Torres et al., 2007</a>). Only few genes, such as histone and some ribosomal genes defy this trend (<a href=\"#bib2\">Dabeva and Warner, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Libuda and Winston, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Moran et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Sutton et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Vilardell and Warner, 1997</a>).

For example, when chromosome gains or losses lead to a decrease in growth rate, a stereotypic slow-growth transcriptional response known as the environmental stress response\u00a0(ESR) ensues (<a href=\"#bib5\">Gasch et al., 2000</a>). The ESR is characterized by the down-regulation of growth-promoting genes and the up-regulation of stress response genes and has been reported to occur in response to aneuploidy in many organisms including laboratory yeast strains (<a href=\"#bib21\">Sheltzer et al., 2012</a>)."

Dosage compensation is best understood in the context of sex chromosome-encoded genes (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib24\">Straub and Becker, 2007</a>). For example in mammals, an RNA-mediated mechanism silences expression of one copy of the X chromosome in females thereby equalizing X chromosome-encoded gene expression between males and females (<a href=\"#bib13\">Lee and Bartolomei, 2013</a>). In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, gene expression of the two X chromosomes is reduced by half in the hermaphrodite to match the expression of the single X chromosome in males (<a href=\"#bib16\">Meyer, 2010</a>). Dosage compensation can also affect specific loci. The perhaps best known example is the histone locus in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib19\">Osley and Hereford, 1981</a>). When an extra copy of the <i>HTA1</i> gene (histone H2A) is introduced into budding yeast, mRNA turnover increases resulting in normal <i>HTA1</i> transcript levels (<a href=\"#bib17\">Moran et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Osley and Hereford, 1981</a>). It is important to note that dosage compensation and transcriptional responses to aneuploidy can have the same effect on a gene. Both can cause the down-regulation of a gene, but the mechanisms are distinct. Transcriptional responses to aneuploidy are elicited by an aneuploid genome affecting a biological pathway and are not restricted to the aneuploid chromosomes but impact expression of genes located throughout the genome. In contrast, dosage compensation specifically alters the expression of a gene whose copy number has been varied and its effects are thus restricted to the aneuploid chromosome."

However, such aneuploidies are usually transient evolutionary intermediates that, given time, are replaced with more optimal solutions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Yona et al., 2012</a>). A key question that arises from these studies is how prevalent whole chromosome gains and losses are in wild yeast strains and how aneuploidies affect cell physiology. <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al. (2015)</a> addressed these questions. They isolated 47 wild yeast strains to identify 12 (26%) that harbored whole chromosome gains and/or losses. The detailed analysis of six of these strains led them to the conclusion that aneuploidies are prevalent, stable and well-tolerated in wild yeast strains. Based on gene expression analyses, they further concluded that tolerance to aneuploidy is caused by dosage compensation mechanisms that buffer gene amplifications thereby protecting cells against the adverse effects of aneuploidy. They reported that gene-dosage compensation functions at &gt;30% of amplified genes."

The nature of the distributions of gene expression patterns (normal distribution with expected means) and these analyses are inconsistent with high levels of dosage compensation occurring in wild yeast strains. Instead, they indicate that gene expression proportionally increases with copy number without signs of dosage compensation in wild yeast strains. The fact that the euploid chromosomes encode the same proportion of up and downregulated genes as the aneuploid chromosomes further indicates that any effects on gene expression seen in these strains are likely to be the consequence of measurement noise or a transcriptional response elicited by the aneuploid state rather than dosage compensation."

The 941 duplicated genes showed a mean log<sub>2</sub> ratio of 1.02 (SD = 0.29, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) for DNA copy number and a nearly identical mean log<sub>2</sub> ratio (mean = 0.97; SD = 0.36, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) for RNA copy number (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, the distribution of expression values fit a normal distribution and was indistinguishable from the distribution of the gene expression values of genes encoded by the euploid chromosomes. The standard deviations of the RNA distributions were similar for euploid and aneuploid chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> bottom graphs) and each distribution showed skewness of 0.01 and 0.02, respectively. These observations indicate that the variance of the euploid genes is the same as that of the aneuploid genes. If dosage compensation were to occur, variance and skewness, would be different between genes encoded by euploid and aneuploid chromosomes. Lastly, using 2 SD as cutoff to find potential dosage compensated genes, we identified a small number of outliers.

To establish cutoffs for designating whether a gene is dosage compensated or not <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al. (2015)</a> used the SD of the DNA measurements, which ranged between 0.1 and 0.45 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> column 11, data kindly provided by A. Gasch) as cutoffs for the RNA measurements (Figure 4 in <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al., 2015</a>). Genes whose expression deviated by the DNA SD value from the expected RNA expression level were considered dosage compensated. This is not the correct cutoff tool because the DNA copy number measurements are less variable than mRNA measurements. As seen in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, transcript levels can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the expression levels of a particular gene. Therefore, the distributions of relative RNA changes will show bigger SDs than gene copy number distributions. Indeed, the RNA measurements conducted by <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al. (2015)</a> show SDs between 0.53 and 1.01 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, column 6). Employing the SD derived from the DNA measurements, which are fairly lower (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, column 8), will therefore not identify genes that are dosage compensated in a statistically significant manner (see false discovery rate discussion below). This is of particular importance as genes identified in Figure 4 of <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al. (2015)</a> as dosage compensated were included in a group of 245 dosage compensated genes used to establish GO term enrichments among dosage compensated genes."

The null model shown by the diagonal of equal RNA and DNA in this figure did not bisect the blue (compensated) and magenta (exacerbated) points.

(2015)</a> to determine the number of dosage compensated genes (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). As this is a randomized dataset, genes identified by this method are noise and can be used to determine the number of genes the analysis method would find just by chance. Based on 10,000 randomizations, we determined that on average, 779 genes would have passed the threshold method used by <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al. (2015)</a> by chance. This yields a false discovery rate (FDR) of 92.9%. This high false discovery rate was also seen at much lower cutoffs. The FDR was between 93 and 100% at cutoffs from 0.1 STD to 2 STDs."

As the DNA measurements for each strain were not reported independently, we calculated the average chromosome-wide DNA error from all the sequencing data that were deposited and used the lowest of these as an estimate for all analyses. We combined these errors together (square root of summed squares of the two composite noises) to give a measurement noise distribution for the experiment. We then randomly sampled from a normal distribution where the SD for this normal distribution was randomly sampled from the measurement noise distribution. Using this method, we found that on average, 754 genes would have passed the effective threshold used by <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al. (2015)</a>. This corresponds to a false discovery rate of 89%; this value is likely a small underestimation of FDR given our method for estimation of DNA error. We conclude that both methods that we applied to determine false discovery rate strongly suggest that only a handful, at most ~70 genes or &lt;3%, are actually dosage compensated. These results are completely in line with previous findings from laboratory strains (<a href=\"#bib22\">Springer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Dephoure et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Torres et al., 2007</a>)."

(2015)</a> defined genes to be dosage compensated when the RNA levels did not increase with DNA copy number in their YPS1009 (2N, 2N+1 chromosome XII, 2N+2 chromosomes XII) and NCYC110 (2N, 2N+1 chromosome VIII, 2N+2 chromosomes VIII) ploidy series. For this, they developed a mixture of linear regression (MLR) model to classify genes based on the slope and intercept of the RNA-gene copy relationships. When RNA levels did not increase proportionately as DNA copy increased as evidenced by slopes lower than 1 in the MLR model, a gene was classified as dosage compensated and categorizes as Class 3a in Table 1 in <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al. (2015)</a>. Thirty\u00a0genes on chromosome VIII and 142 genes on chromosome XII were identified as dosage compensated through this method. This method of identifying dosage compensated genes is problematic in several ways. First, because there are only three data points per analysis, a single deviating data point can have a significant impact on the slope. For example, a gene with values of log<sub>2</sub> ratio = 0.3, 0.6 and 0.8 representing, two, three, and four copies, respectively, will perfectly fit a straight line with the slope of 0.5 and hence would be classified as dosage compensated according to the criteria in <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al. (2015)</a> even though none of the three data points significantly deviates from the mean value given a SD of 0.3 or higher (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In fact, the majority (103 of 172) of class 3a genes (Table 1 and Supplemental File 3 in <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al.

In the first, we calculated the mean and standard deviations for each of the biological replicates in the NCYC110 and YPS1009 strain series and found that only two genes on aneuploid chromosome VIII and seven genes on aneuploid chromosome XII show log<sub>2</sub> ratios 1 SD lower than the mean in three biological replicates and were reproducibly lower when present in 3 or 4 copies. Not a single gene passed the cutoff of 2 SD below the mean. We conclude that for the majority of genes only one of the two data points supports the conclusion that a gene is expressed at lower than the expected value, calling into question that the genes identified by this approach are indeed dosage compensated."

Reevaluation of the DNA and RNA copy number data generated by <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al.

We conclude that wild variants of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> do not have mechanisms in place that protect them from changes in gene copy number. Their regulation of gene expression is thus the same as that of laboratory strains of budding yeast."

To assess this, we took all genes that <a href=\"#bib10\">Hose et al. (2015)</a> had reported as dosage compensated. We took the distribution of RNA/DNA for these compensated genes and called this the observed or reported compensated distribution. The existence of true compensators would lead to significantly more genes in the compensated distribution than in the randomized distribution for a given dosage compensation range.

The copy number plots (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>) show considerable variability from point to point, depending on strain; for example <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> NCYC110 is tightly distributed around 2 DNA copies whereas YPS1009 seems more variable.

The paper by Gasch reports dosage compensation at the transcriptional level in aneuploid wild yeast. The main focus of the reviewed manuscript is to demonstrate that the observed dosage compensation reflects shortcomings of the analysis. Science should foster open disputation of controversial topics. As the field of aneuploidy is rather new and evolving, it is essential to address the disagreements early on and thoroughly. Torres et al. specifically mention the following issues: the used strains may be unstable, the normalization is suboptimal there is no test for significance of the number of dosage compensated genes and its correction for multiple testing the standard deviation of the DNA sequencing data is used as a cut off for determining dosage compensated genes on RNA sequencing data and the three-point analysis to identify dosage compensated genes is too limited and therefore prone to noise-related errors. Since the analysis by Hose et al. has some flaws, this referee feels that the manuscript by Torres et al. should be made public. However, there are several important points that should be addressed."

I found the Torres et al. analysis pretty compelling, and I was rather surprised that the original paper did not include similar analyses. Some of the identified mistakes include errors in normalization, apparent copy number variants in the strains used as euploid controls, and discrepancies between RNA and DNA for some strains.

While in bulk it's clear that the average expression change scales with copy number, individual genes may not.

Science should foster open disputation of controversial topics. As the field of aneuploidy is rather new and evolving, it is essential to address the disagreements early on and thoroughly. Torres et al. specifically mention the following issues: the used strains may be unstable, the normalization is suboptimal there is no test for significance of the number of dosage compensated genes and its correction for multiple testing the standard deviation of the DNA sequencing data is used as a cut off for determining dosage compensated genes on RNA sequencing data and the three-point analysis to identify dosage compensated genes is too limited and therefore prone to noise-related errors.

This paper reaches quite different conclusions than Hose et al. and instead shows a lack of evidence for what Hose et al. call dosage compensation.

Some of the identified mistakes include errors in normalization, apparent copy number variants in the strains used as euploid controls, and discrepancies between RNA and DNA for some strains. Overall I was convinced that there are significant issues with the Hose paper that were masked by the data presentation and analysis methods used. I was particularly convinced by the demonstration that the distribution of gene expression of genes on euploid and amplified chromosomes was identical. One could argue whether the distributions of DNA and RNA should be compared (even given the vastly different dynamic ranges), or whether the exact cutoffs employed are too stringent or not stringent enough, but any model of \"dosage compensation\" seems like it should have genes behaving differently when they are at elevated dosage. This does not appear to be the case. That said, I did find some of the reanalysis a little too demanding: buffering could still be present but below the 2 SD thresholds used throughout.</i>"
