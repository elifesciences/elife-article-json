                    "text": "The hormone estrogen (E2) binds the estrogen receptor to promote transcription of E2-responsive genes in the breast and other tissues. E2 also has links to genomic instability, and elevated E2 levels are tied to breast cancer. Here, we show that E2 stimulation causes a rapid, global increase in the formation of R-loops, co-transcriptional RNA-DNA products, which in some instances have been linked to DNA damage. We show that E2-dependent R-loop formation and breast cancer rearrangements are highly enriched at E2-responsive genomic loci and that E2 induces DNA replication-dependent double-strand breaks (DSBs). Strikingly, many DSBs that accumulate in response to E2 are R-loop dependent. Thus, R-loops resulting from the E2 transcriptional response are a significant source of DNA damage. This work reveals a novel mechanism by which E2 stimulation leads to genomic instability and highlights how transcriptional programs play an important role in shaping the genomic landscape of DNA damage susceptibility."

E2 also has links to genomic instability, and elevated E2 levels are tied to breast cancer. Here, we show that E2 stimulation causes a rapid, global increase in the formation of R-loops, co-transcriptional RNA-DNA products, which in some instances have been linked to DNA damage. We show that E2-dependent R-loop formation and breast cancer rearrangements are highly enriched at E2-responsive genomic loci and that E2 induces DNA replication-dependent double-strand breaks (DSBs). Strikingly, many DSBs that accumulate in response to E2 are R-loop dependent. Thus, R-loops resulting from the E2 transcriptional response are a significant source of DNA damage. This work reveals a novel mechanism by which E2 stimulation leads to genomic instability and highlights how transcriptional programs play an important role in shaping the genomic landscape of DNA damage susceptibility."

The transcription process results in the production of an RNA molecule that contains a copy of the instructions encoded within the gene."

This creates a structure known as an R-loop, which can lead the DNA to break. DNA breaks are particularly harmful because they can dramatically alter the cell\u2019s genome in ways that allow it to become cancerous. However, it was not clear if the large increase in transcription triggered by estrogen causes an increase in R-loops, which could help to explain the DNA damage that has been reported to occur when cells are treated with estrogen."

The R-loops occurred particularly in regions of the genome that contain estrogen-activated genes. Stork et al. also found that regions of estrogen-activated transcription were more frequently mutated in breast cancers, and further experiments confirmed that the R-loops were responsible for many of the DNA breaks that occurred following estrogen treatment. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the changes in transcription due to estrogen lead to increased R-loops and DNA breaks, which may make the cells vulnerable to becoming cancerous."

Knowing the location of the DNA breaks will be useful in determining what additional factors or genomic features make an R-loop more prone to being broken. This in turn might help explain how the R-loops lead to DNA damage. In addition, further studies are also needed to determine if tumor samples from breast cancer patients also contain increased levels of R-loops."

Paradoxically, E2 exposure is also associated with an elevated risk of breast carcinogenesis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liehr, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yager and Davidson, 2006</a>). Specifically, higher E2 serum concentrations and longer lifetime E2 exposure are both positively correlated with an increased incidence of sporadic breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib9\">Clemons and Goss, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Colditz, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hilakivi-Clarke et al., 2002</a>). Breast cancers exhibit a large number of chromosomal abnormalities, including mutations and copy number alterations (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2016</a>). Moreover, E2 leads to DNA damage in breast epithelial cells that express the estrogen receptor (ER) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liehr, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Williamson and Lees-Miller, 2011</a>), and in rat models, E2 stimulation is causally linked to chromosome instability and aneuploidy (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2004</a>). Despite strong links between estrogen and genomic instability, the molecular mechanism by which E2 causes this instability in breast cancer is unclear."

Upon translocation into the nucleus, the E2-ER complex binds to estrogen-response elements or to other transcription factors, thus altering gene expression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Marino et al., 2006</a>). Among the genes induced by E2 are a number that are important for cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gong et al., 2014</a>). Thus, one proposed model to explain E2-induced genome instability is that the uncontrolled proliferation driven by deregulation of genes such as Cyclin D1 causes replication stress and DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caldon, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Halazonetis et al., 2008</a>). However, another relatively unexplored hypothesis is that the dramatic increase in\u00a0transcription itself contributes to E2-induced DNA damage."

                        "text": "Co-transcriptional structures known as R-loops form upon hybridization of nascent RNA with the template DNA strand and are prevalent in mammalian genomes. These structures are proposed to serve regulatory roles in the cell including the patterning of promoter chromatin and the facilitation of transcription termination (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ginno et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2011</a>). In certain contexts, however, R-loops may serve as precursors for DSBs. The coordinated cleavage of an R-loop at the switch region in B-cells facilitates recombination and generates antibody diversity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Santos-Pereira and Aguilera, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yu et al., 2003</a>). Changes in R-loop levels, moreover, are clearly associated with increased DNA damage and genomic instability. For example, the loss of RNA processing and R-loop regulatory factors results in an increase in R-loops and R-loop-dependent DNA damage in both yeast and human cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Garcia-Rubio et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Huertas and Aguilera, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Li and Manley, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Paulsen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sollier et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tuduri et al., 2009</a>). Additionally, highly transcribed loci may be more prone to R-loop formation. This is evidenced by the enrichment of R-loops at rDNA repeats (<a href=\"#bib12\">El Hage et al., 2010</a>) and the binding of the R-loop suppressing factor Npl3 preferentially at the most highly transcribed genes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Santos-Pereira et al., 2013</a>)."

Dramatic and rapid changes in gene expression could challenge co-transcriptional processing pathways resulting in R-loop formation. Here, we tested whether the formation of R-loops following increased gene expression is a source of E2-induced DNA damage in ER-positive breast epithelial cells. We report that E2 treatment leads to a dramatic increase in R-loops, most strongly at E2-responsive genes. E2-responsive genes, moreover, are enriched in breast cancer rearrangements. We find that E2 treatment also leads to a significant increase in DNA replication- and transcription-dependent DNA damage signaling and DSBs through an R-loop dependent process. Collectively, our data indicate that physiological changes in transcription can drive R-loop formation to promote genomic instability in human cells."

To do so, we examined phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (P-H2AX), a marker of DNA damage, after treatment of hormone-starved MCF7 cells with different doses of E2. We observed a clear, dose-dependent increase in P-H2AX intensity 24\u2009hr after E2 addition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). E2 treatment also resulted in an increase in 53BP1 foci (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), another marker of damaged DNA. Hormone-free culture conditions cause ER-positive cells to withdraw from the cell cycle, and low P-H2AX levels arise during normal DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mirzoeva and Petrini, 2003</a>). Thus, we asked whether an increase in the percentage of cells in S phase following E2 stimulation could account for the increased P-H2AX signal. Notably, cells treated with 1 or 100 nM E2 had similar cell cycle profiles (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), despite significantly different P-H2AX levels, suggesting that the increase in DNA damage was not due to differences in the S phase population. Importantly, ER-negative MCF10A breast epithelial cells showed no significant change in P-H2AX signal when treated with 100 nM E2 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 3A,B</a>), consistent with the previous finding that E2-induced DNA damage depends on the ER (<a href=\"#bib54\">Williamson and Lees-Miller, 2011</a>). We also asked if E2 treatment leads to an increase in DSBs or if the observed changes in DNA damage response (DDR) signaling are induced by some alternative mechanism. The neutral comet assay provided direct evidence that E2 leads to DSB formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>)."

                                "text": "Previous studies have shown that E2 induces the rapid and transient formation of DNA breaks necessary for transcriptional induction at E2 promoters, and these breaks have been reported to be dependent upon the activity of TopoII\u03b2 and APOBEC3B (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ju et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Periyasamy et al., 2015</a>). When we examined this early response to E2, we found that the P-H2AX signal resulting from 24\u2009hr of E2 stimulation was significantly greater than the signal resulting from very short (10\u201340 min) treatments, raising the possibility that the later DNA breaks arise through a different mechanism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Given that a significant portion of cells would have entered S-phase by the 24-hr time point, we asked whether DNA replication was associated with E2-induced damage by pulsing cells with EdU at various times after E2 addition and monitoring H2AX phosphorylation. The percentage of P-H2AX positive cells increased dramatically after 16 and 24\u2009hr, and the majority of these cells were EdU positive (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure\u00a01\u00a0F,G</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This finding strongly suggests that E2-induced DNA damage may require DNA replication. Indeed, when we treated E2-stimulated cells with a Cdc7 inhibitor (PHA 767491) that largely blocks S phase entry (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>), we found that the DNA damage was reduced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). At the 1 \u03bcM dose of PHA 767491 used, phosphorylation of RNA\u00a0Pol II at Ser2 by Cdk9 was not inhibited, indicating the effect on P-H2AX is not a result of inhibiting RNA Pol II elongation (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). We also asked if the late phase of E2-induced DNA damage is affected by blocking transcription coincident with S-phase entry. Treatment with the transcription inhibitor flavopiridol abolished the late E2-induced increase in P-H2AX (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>) but did not significantly affect the percentage of cells in S phase (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that E2 induces DSBs in a replication- and transcription-dependent manner."

To do so, we probed genomic DNA from mock- or E2-treated cells (24\u2009hr) with the anti RNA-DNA hybrid monoclonal antibody S9.6 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boguslawski et al., 1986</a>). We observed a dramatic increase in RNA-DNA hybrids upon E2 treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

Using triplicate data for each condition, we combined all DRIP-positive regions in at least one sample with a set of similarly-sized intervals with no significant enrichment and performed the\u00a0differential analysis. Differential peaks were only identified if they showed a significant change upon E2 induction in each biological replicate. Analysis of RNA-DNA hybrids induced after E2 treatment revealed a dramatic increase throughout the genome, with 8,023 and 3,263 peaks significantly induced at 2\u2009hr or 24\u2009hr, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2C \u2014 source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">2</a>). Of those hybrids induced at 24\u2009hr, ~60% were also significantly induced at 2\u2009hr, suggesting that the E2 treatment can result in a sustained increase in R-loop formation at many loci. Loci that showed a robust increase following E2 addition include XBP1, CCND1 (Cyclin D1), and SLC7A5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), all targets of E2-transcription (<a href=\"#bib26\">Honkela et al., 2015</a>).

We found a dramatic enrichment of R-loops in E2-transcriptionally responsive genes at both time points (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, red highlighting). These data clearly demonstrate that the induction of R-loops by E2 is a robust response that occurs quickly at E2-responsive genes, and persists at a subset of these genes.

A modest correlation between the induction of DRIP signal and the induction of expression was observed, consistent with the requirement for transcription in R-loop formation. Although the majority of induced DRIP peaks were found in E2-responsive genes (red\u00a0highlighting), some were also induced at sites that were not E2-responsive or that were negatively regulated by E2 (blue\u00a0highlighting). Both sets of hybrid-forming sequences exhibit GC skew and enhanced G-quadruplex formation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2A,B</a>). We also found no meaningful correlation between DRIP signal enrichment and overall expression level as measured by publically available RNA-seq data from similarly paired conditions. This finding indicates that DRIP peaks do not form only on highly expressed genes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). We conclude that R-loop induction by E2 is correlated with E2-induced transcription, but that expression level is not the sole determinant of R-loop formation and other secondary structures or sequence elements may contribute."

To accomplish this, we utilized the somatic mutation data from the recent, large-scale whole-genome sequencing of 560 breast tumors (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2016</a>). Three groups of somatic mutations were used: 1) structural variants such as duplications, deletions, or inversions, 2) translocations, or 3) simple somatic mutations such as substitutions and indels (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2016</a>). For each group of mutations, we determined whether the sites of mutation were enriched in E2-responsive loci, as measured by the Z-score from RNA-seq data (<a href=\"#bib26\">Honkela et al., 2015</a>). For mutated genes in each of the three classifications, we examined enrichment relative to control gene sets matched for both expression level and replication timing (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2,</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>). Notably, we observed a significant enrichment of both structural variants (p&lt;1.00*10<sup>\u22126</sup>) and translocations (p&lt;1.00*10<sup>\u22126</sup>) in genes that are transcriptionally-responsive to E2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). In contrast, there were fewer simple somatic mutations in E2-responsive loci relative to the matched set (p&lt;1.00*10<sup>\u22126</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results demonstrate that genes whose expression is induced in response to E2 are enriched in genomic rearrangements in breast tumors and support the view that these sites are prone to certain types of DNA damage."

To address this, we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) using the S9.6 and P-H2AX antibodies to visualize interactions between RNA-DNA hybrids and phosphorylated H2AX. Notably, the percentage of cells that contain at least one PLA focus in the nucleus increased approximately 2-fold following E2 treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). The relatively small number of detectable interactions between the RNA-DNA hybrid and P-H2AX antibodies upon E2 addition may indicate that the majority of DNA damage occurs at a distance from the R-loop that is outside the limits of PLA detection (&lt;30\u201340 nM). In order to confirm the interaction between R-loops and P-H2AX, we used the S9.6 antibody to precipitate RNA-DNA hybrids from cross-linked E2-treated cells. We found that that both P-H2AX and another DDR target, P-KAP1, interacted with RNA-DNA hybrid containing chromatin fragments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This interaction was specific, as it did not occur with MCM3, another chromatin-bound protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that DNA damage markers bind the chromatin environment near R-loops following E2 treatment."

If R-loops cause E2-induced DNA damage, expression of RNase H should abrogate DSB formation. We tested this idea by monitoring P-H2AX levels in an MCF7 cell line stably expressing a doxycycline-inducible, Flag-tagged RNase H (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Strikingly, we observed a dramatic and dose-dependent reduction in P-H2AX intensity and foci formation upon increasing RNase H expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar results were observed in two additional independent stable cell clones (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 2A,B</a>). Importantly, expression of RNase H did not alter E2-driven cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), nor did it reduce global levels of transcription, as measured by EU labeling (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 4A,B</a>). Thus, the decreased P-H2AX signal is not a result of reduced transcription or a defect in cell cycle progression. Finally, we found that RNase H expression resulted in a significant decrease in DSBs upon E2 stimulation, as measured by the\u00a0neutral comet assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). These findings clearly demonstrate that RNA-DNA hybrids are needed to form E2-induced DSBs."

In these studies, R-loops were induced by the knockdown of RNA processing genes and/or splicing factors. To ask if the DNA damage resulting from E2-induced co-transcriptional R-loop formation arises by a similar mechanism, we assessed whether knockdown of NER factors altered the DDR following E2. Strikingly, we found that P-H2AX levels were significantly reduced following knockdown of XPG, an endonuclease involved in both forms NER (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). XPG knockdown also dramatically reduced the comet tail moment that forms in response to E2 treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>), signifying a significant reduction in E2-mediated DSBs. Importantly, we also found that knockdown of the TC-NER specific factor Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) significantly reduced P-H2AX levels induced by E2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In contrast, knockdown of XPC, a lesion-recognition factor specifically involved in GG-NER, caused little change in P-H2AX levels after E2 treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). These findings suggest that R-loops induced by E2 are processed by TC-NER factors. Taken as a whole, our findings demonstrate that replication-dependent E2-induced DNA damage results from the induction of R-loops triggered by E2-mediated transcription."

Accordingly, several mechanisms for E2-induced DNA damage have been elucidated. For example, TopoII\u03b2 and APOBEC3B cause the rapid and transient formation of DNA damage in a process necessary for E2-induced transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ju et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Periyasamy et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, E2 metabolites can cause oxidative DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lavigne et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yager, 2014</a>). Here, we report the first R-loop-dependent mechanism of E2-induced DNA damage. Specifically, we show that R-loops induced by E2 treatment in ER-positive breast cancer cells lead to DSB formation in the vicinity of the R-loop. Our findings suggest that increased transcription due to a physiologically relevant stimulus may result in R-loop-mediated genomic instability."

Although E2 causes a dramatic increase in R-loops after 2\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), no significant change in DNA damage is observed at that time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Thus, although R-loops are present, they do not cause DNA damage until S phase entry. Consistent with this finding, R-loop-dependent DNA damage has been previously associated with DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alzu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Houlard et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, a few common fragile sites correspond to late-replicating, long genes where R-loops form, and early-replicating fragile sites are associated with highly transcribed genes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barlow et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Helmrich et al., 2011</a>). This suggests that genes that are highly transcribed or R-loop prone may pose the greatest challenge to genome integrity when they meet the replication fork. Interestingly, we find that TC-NER factors are also involved in generating the replication-associated DNA damage observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This raises the possibility that these factors may be acting in a non-canonical manner in S phase, and there are several possible mechanisms by which their activity may be coordinated with replication activities that have been previously discussed (see <a href=\"#bib52\">Sollier et al., 2014</a>)."

In agreement with this, we see a correlation between the induction of expression by E2, as measured by GRO-seq, and the induction of R-loops by E2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). The modest strength of the correlation likely indicates that factors distinct from the\u00a0transcription status play an important role in dictating R-loop formation. Interestingly, a small subset of genomic regions exist that show a significant increase in R-loops despite no increase in expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>, blue\u00a0highlighting). Similarly, RPL13A, the expression of which is unaffected by E2 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shah and Faridi, 2011</a>), showed a significant increase in R-loops upon E2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). One possibility is that upon a burst in transcription, the cell\u2019s normal splicing and R-loop modulating factors initially become saturated. Thus, some loci that are prone to form R-loops may accumulate these structures and become vulnerable to DNA damage, regardless of their response to the transcription stimulus."

Both structural variants and translocations have been suggested to occur due to erroneous repair of a DSB (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kasparek and Humphrey, 2011</a>) and these mutation types have been shown to be more prevalent in breast tumors relative to other tumor tissues (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). Intriguingly, some cancer-associated genes are found among genes forming E2-induced R-loops. For example, we observed a dramatic increase in R-loops at Cyclin D1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), which is amplified in\u00a0up to 20% of breast cancers, the majority of which are ER-positive (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arnold and Papanikolaou, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Osborne et al., 2004</a>). Similarly, E2 induces robust R-loop formation at ZNF703. This locus has been implicated in driving oncogenesis in luminal B breast tumors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Holland et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sircoulomb et al., 2011</a>). Both Cyclin D1 and ZNF703 were among the genes identified as breast cancer drivers, as were an additional 27 genes with E2-induced R-loops (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2016</a>). Our findings raise the possibility that E2-induced R-loop formation could lead to DNA damage and genome instability at some of these and other R-loop prone loci. Intriguingly, testosterone (DHT) stimulation in prostate cells has been shown to lead to DSBs and recurrent translocations at androgen-receptor (AR) target loci (<a href=\"#bib19\">Haffner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lin et al., 2009</a>). While these breaks are TOP2B-dependent and necessary for the induction of transcription, DHT may also induce DNA damage in an R-loop and replication dependent manner. Notably, in prostate cancer, recurrent rearrangements are frequently observed at androgen-receptor (AR) target genes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kumar-Sinha et al., 2008</a>)."

The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.9, 140\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100) with PI and chromatin was sonicated in shearing buffer (0.1%SDS, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 10\u2009mM Tris pH 8.1) on a Covaris to an average size of 1 kb. Washed Protein A/G sepharose beads (Pierce) were used to pre-clear chromatin for 2\u2009hr. 10 \u03bcg of chromatin and 20 \u03bcg of S9.6 antibody or 20 \u03bcg mouse IgG were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Pre-washed protein A/G sepharose beads were then added to chromatin/antibody mixture for 2\u2009hr. After washing three times in binding buffer (10\u2009mM NaPO4 pH 7, 140\u2009mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100), bound beads were boiled in 30 \u03bcL 5X sample buffer and loaded on a 4\u201320% gradient gel (Biorad)."

This DNA damage is demonstrated by the appearance of P-H2AX, 53BP1 foci, and increased tail moment by neutral comet assay, suggesting these are DNA DSBs. The DNA damage is dependent on both transcription and DNA replication. The significance of the manuscript centers around the idea that DNA DSBs are dependent on R-loops formed by estrogen receptor-mediated transcription, which may saturate co-transcriptional machinery. The work describes that R-loops are formed after estrogen induction, showing convincingly that TC-NER machinery is required for P-H2AX and DSB formation."

It would be important therefore to try to complement with new information probing the proximity of R loops to DNA breaks. Since it seems that using the PLA assay most of the time only one S9.6-P-H2AX foci is observed, this could mean that not all P-H2AX foci originate (directly) from a R-loop, or that H2AX is phosphorylated at different genomic loci than where R-loops are formed.

Although this could indicate that the DNA damage and R-loops do not coincide and breaks arise indirectly from R-loops, there are other interpretations as well. For example, one possibility, as the reviewers suggest, is that the H2AX is phosphorylated at loci far enough downstream of where the R-loop forms such that the distance falls outside of a detectable interaction for the PLA assay. As RNA-DNA hybrids are not expected to bind nucleosomes (Dunn and Griffith, 1980), this is quite feasible and may limit the sensitivity of this assay. We have included a sentence in the main text of the Results where we address this possibility: \u201cThe relatively small number of detectable interactions between the RNA-DNA hybrid and P-H2AX antibodies upon E2 addition may indicate that the majority of DNA damage occurs at a distance from the R-loop that is outside the limits of PLA detection (&lt;30-40 nM)\u201d Nevertheless, we do recognize that this leads to questions about the proximity of DNA damage and R-loops, and we try to address this issue as explained below."

For this analysis, we defined ER target sites as regions of the genome that are transcriptionally responsive to estrogen (E2) as measured by RNA-seq, since ER binding can occur at sites distant from the transcriptional response. As suggested, we utilized the rearrangement data from the whole-genome sequences of 560 breast cancers from Nik-Zainal et al., 2016. We took into account mutations from both ER-positive and ER-negative breast tumors because precursor cells can express high levels of the ER at some point during development (Allred et al., 2004) and therefore could be affected by E2 signaling. Notably, we see that E2-responsive regions are significantly enriched among both breast cancer structural variants and translocations (p&lt;1.0 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). Interestingly, not all mutation types are enriched in E2-responsive genes, as we do not see an enrichment of the simple somatic mutations such as substitutions and indels in E2-responsive genes. We have now included these data as a new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and describe the results in the subsection \u201cBreast cancer rearrangements are enriched in E2-responsive genes\u201d. To ensure that the enrichment we observe is not biased by the gene expression level or replication timing, the latter of which significantly affects mutation frequency (Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 2009), we used background models that match the expression level and replication timing of the genes within each mutation dataset, as shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>. We believe that this data strongly supports the notion that E2-responsive regions of the genome are more frequently rearranged in breast cancer."

However, we have not been able to detect a clear, reproducible increase in ChIP signal upon E2 treatment relative to signal from regions of the genome that do not contain R-loops. Given the potential for megabase-scale spreading of P-H2AX, it is challenging to determine if the increase in signal in non-R-loop regions is due to P-H2AX spreading or poor signal-to-noise. It is also possible we have not chosen the appropriate sites, since we do not expect that double-strand breaks will form at each R-loop in each cell. We have tried performing genome-wide P-H2AX ChIP-seq to help differentiate between these possibilities, but did not detect significant enrichment. We believe that a more sensitive method of double-strand break mapping may be required to definitely map site-specific damage, as the lack of enrichment is an issue with the P-H2AX ChIP approach. Even under ideal conditions when a double-strand break is induced in all cells with the restriction endonuclease AsiSI (Aymard et al., 2014; Iacovoni et al., 2010), we observe enrichment for P-H2AX is 1.8 fold at best."
