While such capacity deteriorates with age in mammals, it remains intact in species such as salamanders, which have an extensive repertoire of regeneration and can undergo multiple episodes through their lifespan. Here we show that, surprisingly, there is a significant induction of cellular senescence during salamander limb regeneration, but that rapid and effective mechanisms of senescent cell clearance operate in normal and regenerating tissues. Furthermore, the number of senescent cells does not increase upon repetitive amputation or ageing, in contrast to mammals. Finally, we identify the macrophage as a critical player in this efficient senescent cell clearance mechanism. We propose that effective immunosurveillance of senescent cells in salamanders supports their ability to undergo regeneration throughout their lifespan."

This happens because mammalian cells gradually lose the ability to divide to produce new cells. This process is called senescence and it helps to prevent cancer by stopping old cells that are more likely to carry harmful mutations from replicating. However the link between senescence and many age-related declines in human health has led scientists to ask whether targeting senescent cells might be one way to treat age-related conditions."

Yun et al. found that macrophages did accumulate around senescent cells in the regenerating limbs of living salamanders. And when a toxin was used to destroy the macrophages in some salamanders, the senescent cells were not cleared in the way they were in salamanders with active macrophages. Hence, macrophages are an essential part of the mechanism that eliminates senescent cells from salamander tissues."

It subsequently became clear that cellular senescence is a stress response that acts both in culture and in vivo to prevent proliferation of cells exposed to oncogenic stress, such as telomere attrition, and various types of DNA damage and oncogene insertions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Serrano et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bodnar et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">d'Adda di Fagagna, 2008</a>). It therefore acts as an effective anti-tumourigenic mechanism (<a href=\"#bib8\">Braig et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Collado et al., 2005</a>). However, senescent cells can also have detrimental effects on biological processes. Long-term accumulation of senescent cells leads to disruption of tissue structure and function, possibly through the acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (<a href=\"#bib10\">Campisi, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Campisi et al., 2011</a>). This is particularly relevant in the context of ageing, as in most species there is a marked accumulation of senescent cells with time (<a href=\"#bib24\">Herbig et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">van Deursen, 2014</a>). Indeed, recent studies have uncovered a causative link between cellular senescence and age-related deterioration (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2013</a>), underscoring the therapeutic benefits of targeting senescent cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Naylor et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">van Deursen, 2014</a>), and establishing cellular senescence as a hallmark of ageing (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lopez-Otin et al., 2013</a>)."

The decline in muscle regeneration with age has recently been linked to the loss of quiescent stem cells through senescence (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, other vertebrates, such as zebrafish and salamanders, are able to accomplish perfect regeneration of a wide range of complex structures throughout their lifespan (<a href=\"#bib34\">Margotta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Azevedo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eguchi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Itou et al., 2012</a>). It is therefore possible that these organisms exhibit mechanisms to curtail cellular senescence, thus allowing them to undergo indefinite rounds of regeneration. However, the occurrence and regulation of cellular senescence during regeneration have not been addressed in such regeneration-competent species. Here, we analysed the process of cellular senescence in salamanders. Our results demonstrate that cellular senescence is a recurrent process during salamander limb regeneration, and is subject to a highly efficient mechanism of macrophage-dependent elimination."

Cellular senescence is a mechanism that irreversibly arrests the proliferation of damaged or dysfunctional cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shay and Roninson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Campisi, 2005</a>), and is triggered upon DNA insults such as UV irradiation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Campisi, 2011</a>). We therefore exposed A1 salamander limb cells to UV, while stabilising the level of p53, which is required for the induction of senescence in certain mammalian contexts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Up to 80% of the irradiated cells entered a state of cell cycle withdrawal within 12 days that, in contrast to quiescence, was accompanied by high levels of Gadd45 expression, permanent \u03b3H2AX foci, and high levels of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2gal), a hallmark of cellular senescence (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dimri et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Campisi, 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013F</a>).

We found that there is a significant induction of cellular senescence during the intermediate stages of regeneration (mid-blastema and palette), but that the number of senescent cells diminishes subsequently (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Within the regenerating limb, senescent cells are found at the level of the amputation plane, including cartilage and muscle, and within the blastema, including fibroblast, monocyte-like cells, and epidermal glands (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To corroborate that SA-\u03b2gal<sup>+</sup> cells exhibit other hallmarks of cellular senescence in vivo, we performed SA-\u03b2gal/EdU stainings in regenerating or normal tissues following systemic EdU injections. We were unable to detect SA-\u03b2gal<sup>+</sup>/EdU<sup>+</sup> cells under any condition examined (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that SA-\u03b2gal<sup>+</sup> cells are withdrawn from the cell cycle, a characteristic of senescent cells."

After an initial non-specific loss of cells following implantation, the normal cells (A1 GFP+) persist for at least 40 days and contribute to structures within the limb tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). In contrast, 80% of the implanted senescent cell population is cleared from the limb tissues within 2 weeks post-implantation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), consistent with a half-life of 9 days (calculated from the exponential equation corresponding to the senescent dataset, after subtraction of the initial loss observed in normal cells), comparable to the rate of clearance of senescent cells during regeneration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Although this experiment suggests that senescent cells are being cleared from salamander tissues, it cannot exclude the possibility that some cells may reverse their senescence state. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed the same experiment using retrovirally labelled nGFP senescent cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The rate of clearance of nGFP+ senescent cells corresponds to the rate of clearance of unlabelled senescent cells, supporting the clearance hypothesis. In contrast, the implantation of a population of nGFP cells exposed to a UV dose of 1J/m2, 10 times lower than the dose required for senescence induction (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), results in persistence of the implanted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

It has been recently shown that senescent cells are able to induce senescence in their neighbours, a phenomenon termed \u2018senescence bystander effect\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nelson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acosta et al., 2013</a>). We found that this property is also present in senescent salamander cells. Cellular senescence can be induced in normal cells by co-culture with senescent cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), or following incubation with purified media from senescent populations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), supporting the idea that senescence can be transmitted in a paracrine fashion. In addition, implantation of the 1:1 mixture of senescent + normal cells results in the induction of senescence in normal cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>), providing an explanation for their eventual clearance. Together, these results suggest that active mechanisms identify and target senescent cells for clearance within salamander tissues."

                                "text": "A series of elegant experiments have recently described a role for the immune system in the surveillance and clearance of p53 or oncogene-induced senescent hepatocytes in mice (<a href=\"#bib52\">Xue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lujambio et al., 2013</a>). In addition, recent evidence suggests that there is an extensive recruitment of immune cells, and in particular macrophages, to the regenerating limb in salamanders (<a href=\"#bib22\">Godwin et al., 2013</a>). Hence, we decided to investigate if the macrophage was part of the senescence clearance mechanism. In vivo labelling using TMR-dextran, which is specifically internalised by macrophages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>), as well as monocyte specific \u03b1-naphthyl acetate esterase staining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), reveal that macrophages and senescent cells are found in close proximity within regenerating limbs, suggesting cell-to-cell contact and engulfment in some cases. To determine whether macrophages mediate the clearance of senescent cells, we took advantage of an efficient method for macrophage depletion, based on the intravenous administration of selectively toxic, clodronate salt-filled liposomes (clodrosomes). These are internalised specifically by macrophages via phagocytosis (<a href=\"#bib50\">van Rooijen and Hendrikx, 2010</a>) and have been shown to operate effectively in salamanders (<a href=\"#bib22\">Godwin et al., 2013</a>). We found that treatment with clodrosomes is able to reduce the macrophage population by fivefold, compared with control DiI liposomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). As with the TMR-dextran, these liposomes are specifically internalised by macrophages, as shown by their incorporation into cells expressing F4/80, a specific macrophage marker (<a href=\"#bib35\">Morris et al., 1991</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We therefore used this system to induce systemic macrophage depletion in salamanders prior to the implantation of senescent or normal nGFP+ cells in contralateral regenerating limbs, and followed the fate of the implanted cells with time (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). At 20 hr post implantation, we observed a strong accumulation of DiI-labelled macrophages in the vicinity of senescent cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). In contrast, macrophage recruitment to areas of normal cells (control) was not significantly different from their recruitment to other areas of the limb mesenchyme (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F</a>). At 2 weeks post implantation, the normal cells remained within the regenerating limbs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). However, the senescent cells were cleared in animals injected with control DiI liposomes, but remained in animals whose macrophages had been depleted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). This demonstrates that the macrophage is critical for clearance of senescent cells, and constitutes the first evidence for senescence surveillance mechanisms that operate during normal regeneration."

Our study demonstrates that a robust macrophage-dependent surveillance mechanism operates in normal and regenerating tissues of adult salamanders, and this allows them to circumvent the negative effects associated with the long-term accumulation of senescent cells, such as the disruption of tissue structure and function (<a href=\"#bib10\">Campisi, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rodier and Campisi, 2011</a>). These surveillance mechanisms are particularly significant for limb regeneration because there is a notable induction of cellular senescence during this process. Consistent with this, recent reports show that systemic macrophage depletion during salamander limb regeneration leads to defects in this process (<a href=\"#bib22\">Godwin et al., 2013</a>). This has also been observed during zebrafish fin regeneration (<a href=\"#bib40\">Petrie et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, cellular senescence has been recently shown to contribute to the decline in muscle regenerative ability upon ageing in mammals (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</a>). In light of these observations, we propose that the effective immune clearance of senescent cells in salamanders supports their ability to undergo multiple rounds of regeneration through their lifespan (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

They produce a range of secreted molecules (SASPs) which affect their microenvironment and could contribute to different aspects of the regeneration process such as matrix remodelling, vascularisation, growth and patterning. As regeneration proceeds to more advanced stages, senescent cells are cleared by an efficient mechanism of macrophage dependent immunesurveillance, which results in a regenerated limb devoid of senescent cells. This allows for the possibility of multiple rounds of regeneration through lifespan as well as avoiding the disadvantages of senescent cell accummulation."
