This is well exemplified by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, whose alteration contributes to the dramatic disease Timothy Syndrome. For T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, a long-held view is that they are not regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Here we challenge this notion by using dedicated electrophysiological protocols on both native and expressed T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. We demonstrate that a rise in submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces a large decrease in T-type current amplitude due to an important hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation. Activation of most representative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ionotropic receptors similarly regulate T-type current properties. Altogether, our data clearly establish that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry exerts a feedback control on T-type channel activity, by modulating the channel availability, a mechanism that critically links cellular properties of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to their physiological roles."
