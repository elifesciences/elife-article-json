Combining electron microscopy, genetics, transcriptome profiling, calcium imaging, and optogenetics, we discovered a peptidergic neuron that modulates <i>C. elegans</i> motor circuit dynamics. The Six/SO-family homeobox transcription factor UNC-39 governs lineage-specific neurogenesis to give rise to a neuron RID. RID bears the anatomic hallmarks of a specialized endocrine neuron: it harbors near-exclusive dense core vesicles that cluster periodically along the axon, and expresses multiple neuropeptides, including the FMRF-amide-related FLP-14. RID activity increases during forward movement. Ablating RID reduces the sustainability of forward movement, a phenotype partially recapitulated by removing FLP-14. Optogenetic depolarization of RID prolongs forward movement, an effect reduced in the absence of FLP-14. Together, these results establish the role of a neuroendocrine cell RID in sustaining a specific behavioral state in <i>C. elegans</i>."

Combining electron microscopy, genetics, transcriptome profiling, calcium imaging, and optogenetics, we discovered a peptidergic neuron that modulates <i>C. elegans</i> motor circuit dynamics. The Six/SO-family homeobox transcription factor UNC-39 governs lineage-specific neurogenesis to give rise to a neuron RID. RID bears the anatomic hallmarks of a specialized endocrine neuron: it harbors near-exclusive dense core vesicles that cluster periodically along the axon, and expresses multiple neuropeptides, including the FMRF-amide-related FLP-14. RID activity increases during forward movement. Ablating RID reduces the sustainability of forward movement, a phenotype partially recapitulated by removing FLP-14. Optogenetic depolarization of RID prolongs forward movement, an effect reduced in the absence of FLP-14. Together, these results establish the role of a neuroendocrine cell RID in sustaining a specific behavioral state in <i>C. elegans</i>."

Unlike classical neurotransmitters that activate receptors at the vicinity of their release sites (active zones) to trigger rapid and short-lived responses, neuromodulators, released by the dense core vesicles (DCVs) either peri-synaptically or volumetrically, may diffuse over long distances and posses longer half-lives (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib71\">N\u00e4ssel, 2009</a>).

One of the best-described examples is the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG), a single rhythm generating circuit that drives different motor patterns of the gut to either grind or filter food (<a href=\"#bib38\">Harris-Warrick et al., 1992</a>). A variety of amines and neuropeptides, secreted from the descending and ascending peptidergic neurons directly on the STG neuropils, and likely also from the hemolymph, act on every neuron and synapse in this circuit, reconfiguring the network to produce different output patterns (<a href=\"#bib12\">Blitz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Marder and Bucher, 2007</a>). Similarly, in the feeding circuit of the sea slug <i>Aplysia</i>, the balance between the activity of two interneurons, which determines whether food is ingested or egested, is regulated by neuropeptides (<a href=\"#bib50\">Jing et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Taghert and Nitabach, 2012</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, local modulatory neurons in the ventral nerve cord secrete biogenic amines to activate and modify crawling patterns (<a href=\"#bib86\">Selcho et al., 2012</a>).

We recently completed the serial electron microscope (EM) reconstruction of several <i>C. elegans</i> larvae (Witvliet et al. in preparation), fixed by tannic acid and high-pressure freezing that allows for better preservation of intracellular structures in physiological states (<a href=\"#bib80\">Rostaing et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Weimer, 2006</a>). These and our other unpublished EM studies reveal two distinct sources for neuropeptides. First, all classical chemical synapses contain a small portion of DCVs, typically residing at the periphery of presynaptic termini. Second, a small cohort of dedicated secretory neurons can be distinguished by the prevalence of DCVs, which can be further divided into two subgroups. One, including NSM, BDU, and a few other neurons, exhibits mixed anatomic features that may equally support both secretory and synaptic transmission; the other exhibits predominantly secretory anatomic features. RID, a neuron currently of incomplete anatomic reconstruction (<a href=\"#bib104\">White et al., 1986</a>), and of unknown function, belongs to the second group.

Through anatomic, developmental, and functional analyses, we discover that RID is a peptidergic neuron that modulates the <i>C. elegans</i> motor state to sustain forward movement, and it does so in part through secreting a FMRF-amide family neuropeptide FLP-14. Our findings lay the groundwork for further interrogation of mechanisms that underlie neuroendocrine development, evolution, and circuit modulation."

Third, the lineage development that gives rise to RID exhibited fully penetrant mitosis and terminal differentiation defects in <i>unc-39</i> embryos.

By simultaneous DIC and fluorescent tracing, we confirmed that in wild-type embryos, the progeny of ABalappaa followed stereotypic spatial and temporal patterns for mitosis and apoptosis, and its designated anterior granddaughter turned on the RID (<i>Pceh-10</i>) fate marker shortly after the second round of mitosis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In <i>unc-39</i> embryos, ABalappaa exhibited a missed, accelerated, or delayed second mitosis; its progeny did not turn on or maintain the <i>Pceh-10</i> marker and/or execute apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Reassuringly, using transcriptional reporters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>; Appendix 1), we confirmed that <i>flp-14</i> and <i>ins-17</i> are robustly expressed in RID and additional neurons. For <i>flp-14</i>, these neurons include ALA (weak and variable expression), PDE, and PLN (strong expression, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Based on their soma positions, other neurons that consistently express <i>flp-14</i> may be AIM, AIY, and AVK."

Briefly, we tagged Chrimson with ZF1, a degron recognized by an embryonic-specific E3 ligase ZIF-1, so that selective chrimson degradation in non-RID neurons could be induced by an exogenous expression of ZIF-1 (Details described in Appendix 1). Due to potential concerns on a delay or ineffectiveness in optogenetic stimulation of DCV exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Arrigoni and Saper, 2014</a>), we used a robust stimulation protocol (a three-minute light ON/three minute light OFF cycle; Materials and methods; Appendix 1), where we compared the run length with or without stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), as well as the change of mean velocity before and after stimulation during a forward run (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>)."

Similar to the case of the crustacean STG (<a href=\"#bib55\">Kilman and Marder, 1996</a>), and in the brain (<a href=\"#bib63\">Maley, 1990</a>), we observed a wide distribution of DCVs across most neuropils with different distribution patterns. Most neurons have sparse DCVs localized to the periphery of classic presynaptic termini. But some neurons, such as RID, are specialized endocrine cells that predominantly harbor DCV pools. A precise measurement of the DCV size in this dataset was difficult due to the section thickness (70 nm), but they are easily distinguishable from clear synaptic vesicles by size (&gt;40 nm) and dark appearance. Like synaptic vesicles, they cluster in bouton-like compartments that lack active zones, or, do not tether around them when active zone-like structures are present in the compartment. Hence, contents of DCVs may be co-released at synapses with neurotransmitters, as well as be released diffusely and asynchronously. The ultra-structural criteria for neuroendocrine cells in <i>C. elegans</i> are consistent with those in other systems."

Being the sole neuron that extends a process throughout the entire length of the dorsal nerve cord, RID resembles a descending peptidergic modulator of the motor circuit. We show that the loss of RID does not abolish the animal\u2019s ability to execute forward movement, but reduces its duration and velocity, whilst increasing the propensity for the opposing motor modes. RID exhibits an activity increase after animals switch from reversals to foraging, and a decrease when they transit to reversals. Optogenetic stimulation of RID prolonged forward runs, but was insufficient to cause an immediate switch from the reversal mode to foraging. Notably, RID was one of the neurons that exhibited a coordinated activity pattern with known components of the forward motor circuit in a pan-neuronal imaging study on immobilized animals (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kato et al., 2015</a>).

Similarly, the <i>C. elegans</i> motor output can be modulated at multiple layers, by different neuromodulators and from different neuronal origins. Some neuromodulators modify the activity of the core motor circuit components. An escape behavior is facilitated by tyramine released by an interneuron (RIM), which inhibits a premotor interneuron (AVB) to halt forward movement, and simultaneously activates the GABAergic motor neurons (VDs) to induce deep bending (<a href=\"#bib26\">Donnelly et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Pirri et al., 2009</a>). Upon exposure to food, dopaminergic sensory neurons activate an NLP-12-releasing interneuron (DVA), which acts upon cholinergic motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib43\">Hu et al., 2011</a>) to reduce forward runs, retaining animals on food (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</a>). Other neuromodulators function through complex and not yet deciphered circuit pathways: PDF-1 promotes forward runs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Janssen et al., 2009</a>) and roaming (<a href=\"#bib28\">Flavell et al., 2013</a>). It is released by a forward-promoting premotor interneuron (AVB) and other neurons, and may act through multiple and upper layer interneurons (<a href=\"#bib28\">Flavell et al., 2013</a>). A NLP-12-releasing interneuron (DVA) coordinates with a FLP-1-releasing interneuron (AVK) to facilitate a body posture change that is associated with halting the forward runs when animals encounter an oxygen reduction (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hums et al., 2016</a>).

Two main reported inputs to RID in the adult wiring diagram are the premotor interneurons of the forward motor circuit, PVC and AVB, (<a href=\"#bib104\">White et al., 1986</a>). Such a circuit disposition would allow RID to function downstream of the forward-driving premotor interneurons to promote forward bouts. Ablation of PVC and AVB separately (and with other interneurons); however, did not abolish the RID\u2019s activity rise during, or coordination with, forward movement (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,E</a>).

Because the majority of RID presynaptic termini do not contain active zones, the peptidergic nature of RID emphasizes the necessity to identify FLP-14 downstream signaling through its receptors, instead of strictly based on the active zone structures. The striking analogy between the anatomic structure and cellular contents of RID in different nematode species suggests that RID may directly activate body wall muscles and forward-driving motor neurons, and if so, they would involve unpredicted receptors. Screening for GPCR receptors that exhibit physical interactions with FLP-14 offers a plausible entry point."

We also tested a possibility that defective GABA uptake may also contribute to the influence of RID on forward runs. RID expresses <i>snf-11</i>, a plasma membrane GABA transporter (<a href=\"#bib70\">Mullen et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that RID could take up GABA, and either modulate motor output by removing GABA from the surroundings, or by re-releasing the acquired GABA. However, we found that <i>snf-11</i> mutants did not show changes in forward and reversal propensity and <i>snf-11; flp-14</i> double mutants exhibited the similar motor characteristics as <i>flp-14</i> single mutants. PDF-1, a neuropeptide with a known effect on forward runs, was suggested to be expressed by RID (<a href=\"#bib48\">Janssen et al., 2010</a>). However, our examination of a PDF-1 reporter strain from a recent study (<a href=\"#bib82\">Sammut et al., 2015</a>) showed that the <i>Ppdf-1</i>-positive neuron was instead ALA; a notion that also explained why in our datasets, <i>pdf-1</i> was an equally enriched transcript from both wild-type and <i>unc-39</i> animals (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). NLP-34 could be another RID effector despite its fairly low abundance and less significant enrichment (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), but a lack of <i>nlp-34</i> mutants prevented us from examining its involvement.

Indeed, our <i>Pflp-14</i> reporter exhibited expression in several additional neurons, some of which have been implicated in promoting pauses (ALA) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Fry et al., 2014</a>) or inhibiting reversals (AIY) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Gray et al., 2005</a>).

Our study pinpoints a critical, lineage-specific role of a Six family transcription factor in mitosis, a cellular function that may unify and underlie vastly diverse phenotypic presentations. In <i>C. elegans</i>, while multiple cells are affected by <i>unc-39</i> mutations, the RID lineage is particularly sensitive to the perturbation of UNC-39 activity. A key feature of the RID lineage defect was the random timing of the second round of mitosis in precursor cells. Such a phenotype implies a crucial role for UNC-39 in the onset of and exit from the cell cycle that is to be followed by RID terminal differentiation. Mechanisms that couple cell cycle and terminal differentiation have remained elusive (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hardwick and Philpott, 2014</a>). We propose that UNC-39 and its RID lineage-specific partners may be responsible for such a coupling. The absence of corpora cardiac, the insect pituitary in <i>Drosophila SO</i> mutants further entices the speculation of functional conservation for the Six transcription factors in endocrine development (<a href=\"#bib23\">De Velasco et al., 2004</a>)."

Some of these transcripts represent candidate transcripts either activated or repressed by UNC-39. A well-controlled subtractive transcriptome dataset should provide not only cell-type markers, but also targets that are regulated by lineage-specifying transcription factors.

Cross-correlation analyses were performed between rate of acceleration and calcium rise, as well as deceleration and calcium decay."

Animals were then individually washed in the NGM buffer before allowed to navigate on the surface of a 100 mm NGM plate without food. We used the Colbert system to stimulate Chrimson with a Diode red laser (MRL-III-635, 635 nm wavelength, 200 mW maximum power, CNI Laser) and carry out dark-field imaging using infrared light and a dark field condenser (Nikon) using a 10X Plano Apo objective (NA\u00a0=\u00a00.45). A motorized stage and custom real-time computer vision software kept the animal in the center of the field of view. The locomotion of each animal was recorded for 30 min or until it reached the edge of the plate. The laser was set at a 3 min on/3 min off cycle during the recording. Data was collected at 30 f/s and analyzed using a customized particle-tracking and shape analysis algorithms. Each trajectory was segmented into periods of forward movement (runs) separated by sharp orientations (turns). Turns were automatically flagged when the heading change of the center of the mass trajectory was &gt;60\u00b0 over 1 s. To quantify the change of phase velocities before and after the laser was switched on (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), we quantified velocity when the laser was on during a run with 10 s of forward movement before and after the switch for wild-type, <i>flp-14</i> and <i>npr-4 npr-11</i> animals, and 4 s before and 4 s after the switch for <i>unc-39</i> animals.

The authors identify the RID neuron as a neuroendocrine cell because of its large number of dense core vesicles. In a screen for mutants that specifically disrupt RID differentiation, they identified the Six/SO homeodomain transcription factor UNC-39. Loss of unc-39 results in loss of several RID markers and its distinctive axonal morphology. Although the unc-39 results are solid, they were not well integrated into the overall theme of the paper (neuropeptide modulation of forward movement)."

The calcium imaging was supported by behavioral work that showed that unc-39 mutants and RID-ablated animals had shorter forward runs and more turns than wild type, although unc-39 mutants had a more severe phenotype than the RID-ablated animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), suggesting that unc-39 regulates other neurons that sustain forward movement. The authors followed up by showing that optogenetic stimulation of RID caused a sustained increase in forward velocity and runs."

However, as the authors note, the defects in flp-14 are not as severe as in unc-39 mutants and RID-ablated animals, suggesting that other peptides may act in concert with FLP-14 to modulate forward movement. In addition, the behavioral assays were highly variable (i.e., the SEMs are very large, suggesting a lot of variability in the behaviors). For instance, the wild-type values for average forward duration were significantly different in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A' and 5C'</a>. This variability makes looking at defects in flp-14 mutants and its rescue difficult; for instance, 1) the average forward duration for flp-14 mutants looked significantly different from wild type in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A'</a>, but not really in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C'</a>; 2) the flp-14 mutants were not rescued with a copy of the flp-14 transgene for average forward duration to levels seen in wild type or even the flp-14 transgenics alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B'</a>); and 3) the flp-14 mutants did not look significantly different from the flp-14 transgenic line (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C'</a>). The only consistent defect seen with the flp-14 mutants was the decrease in the number of forward initiations. The authors should re-word some of their statements."

These controls were not to be compared with each other. The genotype information is provided in figure legends. Second, even for strains of the identical genetic background, the absolute value of the motor behavioral index would exhibit variability when they are assayed on different days. In our behavioral assays, we only compare values of animals assayed on the same day and on the same plate, as we explained in the Materials and methods and Appendix 1. The variability we observed is standard for these motor behavioral assays that were performed by our group, so we are confident with conclusions drawn from these data."

We provide more background and expand Discussion in the revised manuscript. DD could be a candidate due to its proximity, but other motor neuron neurites are also fairly close. A main issue is that the post-synaptic partner of peptidergic neurons could not be reliably predicted by anatomic apposition. We also suspect that the predicted FLP-14 receptors are incorrect: we did not find any supportive experimental evidence for the predicted FLP-14 receptor mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> in Resubmission). The proposed experiments will be informative, but we feel that it is only the starting point for deciphering the RID circuit. It should be the focus of future investigation."

The speed of unstimulated flp-14 mutants was significantly higher than that of wild-type while the stimulated speeds of the two strains were much more similar. Therefore, a possible (plausible?) interpretation of the difference in fold change is a ceiling effect. The animals, on average, didn't move faster than ~0.55 body-lengths per sec such that the unstimulated mutants didn't have as much capacity for speedup as wild-type. The data in panel C possibly suffers from a similar (not unrelated) issue: T_off for the mutants is higher than wild-type.</i> "

Stimulation on and off events were pooled (N) from recordings of the same genotype, and we compared the motor behaviors with and without stimulation within the same recording using two indexes: a) The mean duration of all forward run events during the ON and OFF periods (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; previously <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). b) The velocity before and after the simulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B, C</a>; previously <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6A, B</a>).

This was because the motor state of the animal, when the light was on, was random. There was a concern with a timing effort (e.g. the animal was at a low or high velocity forward state when the stimulation was turned on), or, false negative effect (e.g. we hit the animal when it was reversing). Hence we selected for stimulation events that happened within a forward run, with at least 4 seconds before and after the stimulation. The previous choice of 4s was set by the motor defects of <i>unc-39</i> mutants: these animals almost exclusively exhibited short runs; if we chose a longer time, N from the <i>unc-39</i> dataset would be too small."

This amounted to 12-14hr recording, for three genotypes of ~6~10 animals/genotype). After recording, we mounted each animal to examine with a high magnification microscope, and discarded data from animals that showed residual chrimson signals in neurons other than RID. Three independent repeats were performed. The scarcity of samples prevented us from using animals at the identical developmental stage, and we had to pool recording data obtained on different dates. Together with the small number of Ns for velocity comparison, we felt that we should only use these datasets to compare the motor behavior within the same recording, hence the normalized difference at the ON and OFF period.
