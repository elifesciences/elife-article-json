Here we present structural and functional studies of a dual RCK-containing, multi-ligand gated K<sup>+</sup> channel from <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i>, named GsuK. We demonstrate that ADP and NAD<sup>+</sup> activate the GsuK channel, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> serves as an allosteric inhibitor. Multiple crystal structures elucidate the structural basis of multi-ligand gating in GsuK, and also reveal a unique ion conduction pore with segmented inner helices. Structural comparison leads us to propose a novel pore opening mechanics that is distinct from other K<sup>+</sup> channels. "

Here we present structural and functional studies of a dual RCK-containing, multi-ligand gated K<sup>+</sup> channel from <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i>, named GsuK. We demonstrate that ADP and NAD<sup>+</sup> activate the GsuK channel, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> serves as an allosteric inhibitor. Multiple crystal structures elucidate the structural basis of multi-ligand gating in GsuK, and also reveal a unique ion conduction pore with segmented inner helices. Structural comparison leads us to propose a novel pore opening mechanics that is distinct from other K<sup>+</sup> channels. "

As demonstrated in the structure of MthK, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel from <i>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</i>, four RCK dimers assemble into an octameric gating ring in a functional channel tetramer (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang et al., 2002a</a>). The same quaternary complex is also observed in the K<sup>+</sup> transporter systems (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albright et al., 2006</a>), indicating that a gating ring of eight RCK domains is the functional assembly for both channels and transporters. Most prokaryotic RCK-containing K<sup>+</sup> channels have only one copy of the RCK domain on each subunit and the formation of an octameric gating ring requires the co-expression of their cytosolic RCK domain via an alternative internal translation start site on the same gene (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang et al., 2002a</a>). The eukaryotic Slo K<sup>+</sup> channel families and a subset of prokaryotic K<sup>+</sup> channels already contain two tandem RCK domains on each subunit and therefore the gating ring assembly in these channels no longer requires the co-expression of an isolated RCK domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The formation of the gating ring provides a platform for diverse allosteric ligand regulation among RCK-containing channels, and the gating rings of some channels are susceptible to multiple cellular stimuli. For example, the RCK domains of BK channels have multiple divalent cation (Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) binding sites for channel activation and can be modulated by phosphorylation and heme binding, and so on (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Xia et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bao et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zeng et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hou et al., 2009</a>)."

The two intracellular ligand binding RCK domains form a bi-lobed structure equivalent to the MthK RCK dimer; each lobe consists of the N-terminal two-thirds of the RCK domain (\u03b2A to \u03b1F) and adopts a Rossmann-fold (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rossmann et al., 1974</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>). While the secondary structural elements of the C-terminal subdomains are similar between GsuK and MthK, their tertiary structural arrangements are quite distinct. In MthK, the N-terminal lobes and the C-terminal subdomains of the RCK dimer are connected by interlocking helix-turn-helix motifs (\u03b1F-turn-\u03b1G), which provide extensive dimerization interactions at the so-called flexible interface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In GsuK, the equivalent \u03b1G helix is absent in RCK1 and becomes a shorter helix with a different orientation in RCK2, resulting in swapped and loosely packed C-terminal subdomains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Four GsuK intracellular subunits assemble into a gating ring containing eight RCK domains through inter-subunit interactions at the assembly interfaces (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), with the N-terminal Rossmann-folded lobe of each RCK forming the core of the gating ring and the C-terminal subdomain loosely associating with the core of the gating ring on the periphery."

The pore-connecting top half of the GsuK gating ring is in a contracted form similar to the closed MthK whereas the bottom half is more expanded (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), suggesting that the structure likely represents a closed conformation. Furthermore, each subunit also contains a small fragment of the pore-lining inner helix at its N-terminus, which forms a short four-helix bundle atop the center of the gating ring and creates a constriction point at the intracellular end of the pore that would occlude the passage of hydrated K<sup>+</sup> ions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,D</a>). The same closed gate is also observed in the structures of the full-length channel as discussed later. The helix bundle is tethered to RCK1 by linkers in an extended configuration, ensuring a tight coupling between the gating ring conformational change and pore opening at the intracellular gate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Indeed, electron density modeled as AMP was observed at the predicted nucleotide binding site in the GsuK gating ring structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). As no nucleotides were added during protein purification or crystallization, the bound nucleotide is likely from the <i>E. coli</i> cells used for protein expression. Although modeled as AMP, the electron density could actually be from other adenine-containing nucleotide whose AMP moiety is well structured while the rest is mobile. This is the case in the structure of the nucleotide binding RCK domain from a K<sup>+</sup> transporter, in which only the AMP portion of a bound NAD<sup>+</sup> can be defined (<a href=\"#bib27\">Roosild et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Albright et al., 2006</a>).

The second bound ion, identified as Ca<sup>2+</sup> based on ligand chemistry and functional assays, is positioned at the inter-subunit assembly interface, a location reminiscent of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl in BK channel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>).

First, instead of forming a single straight helix, the long inner helix of GsuK is segmented into three parts, labeled TM2A, 2B and 2C, respectively (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The break between TM2A and 2B is at a position near the helix-breaking PVP region of Kv channels (<a href=\"#bib22\">Long et al., 2007</a>). Second, rather than forming a bundle crossing right below the central cavity as seen in the closed KcsA structure (<a href=\"#bib10\">Doyle et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zhou et al., 2001</a>), the four inner helices of GsuK are more parallel to the central pore axis and generate an elongated, water-filled vestibule that spans twice the length of the KcsA cavity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Third, the second inner helix break reorients the TM2C segment towards the central axis, forming a constriction at the very end in a channel tetramer and pinching shut the pore at residue Leu117 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>)."

In one subunit, the ADP is in an extended <i>trans</i> configuration, whereas in the other subunits the ADP is in a <i>cis</i> configuration with respect to the phosphoester bond. In the <i>cis</i> configuration, the \u03b2-phosphate makes a sharp turn and inserts itself into a pocket formed by the loops from \u03b2A-to-\u03b1A and from \u03b2D-to-\u03b1D on the second RCK domain (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). The pocket is located at the base of the flexible interface and analogous to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site in the MthK RCK (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>), suggesting that ADP binding in the <i>cis</i> configuration represents an activating state and promotes the gating ring conformational change at the flexible interface similar to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in MthK.

Nevertheless, partially occupied nucleotide is clearly visible in the F<sub>o</sub>\u2013F<sub>c</sub> omit map in two of the subunits (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). In particular, the ADP and nicotinamide moieties of NAD<sup>+</sup> can be properly defined in the electron density map as both are engaged in direct interactions with the protein, whereas the bridging ribose in between is flexible. The position of the nicotinamide group suggests a different activating mechanism between NAD<sup>+</sup> and ADP. The NAD<sup>+</sup> nicotinamide group is inserted beneath the N-terminal end of the crossover \u03b1F helix in RCK1 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>), at the hinge of the flexible interface between \u03b2F and \u03b1F where the gating ring conformational change occurs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ye et al., 2006</a>). The strategic position and the positive charge suggest that the nicotinamide serves as the activation group of NAD<sup>+</sup> and works as a lever whose insertion promotes the hinged motion at the flexible interface towards the open conformation in GsuK. One plausible explanation for the specificity for NAD<sup>+</sup> but not NADH is that the tightly-spaced binding pocket permits the insertion of a flat pyridine ring from the nicotinamide of NAD<sup>+</sup> but excludes the puckered dihydropyridine ring from NADH."

Ca<sup>2+</sup> stabilizes the closed gating ring by binding at the inter-subunit assembly interfaces and deactivates the GsuK channel. Ca<sup>2+</sup> deactivation has a dominant effect on GsuK gating as the removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases the channel open probability regardless of the presence or absence of nucleotides. The gating effect of nucleotide binding is less profound than Ca<sup>2+</sup> as it only moderately enhances the channel open probability under a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-deactivated state. While both NAD<sup>+</sup> and ADP anchor their adenine rings at the same site on RCK2 by using the conserved nucleotide binding motif, they utilize different functional groups and activate the channel at different sites. In addition to nucleotide and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the GsuK RCK2 also has a high affinity site for Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion whose functional role, if any, is unclear. Despite differences in ligands, there is a convergence of the ligand activation sites between GsuK and other RCK-regulated channels. Albeit with opposite gating effect, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site of GsuK is analogous to the position of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bowl in BK (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Yuan et al., 2010</a>); and the ADP activation site in GsuK is equivalent to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site in MthK (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang et al., 2002a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dong et al., 2005</a>). In addition, many RCK domains from channels or transporters contain the conserved nucleotide binding motif at the same position, indicating a common site for adenine-containing nucleotide ligand."

Although the intracellular gates of both the wild-type and L97D mutant channels are closed in the structures, the structural difference between their ion conduction pores suggests a distinct pore opening mechanism for GsuK. The L97D mutant appears to promote inner helix bending at the glycine gating hinge (Gly92) and the direction of the helix bend is parallel with the orientation of the linker between the pore and the gating ring. Its gating ring, however, is still in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound, closed conformation, which locks the intracellular gate closed at the end of the inner helix and prevents the concurrent movement of the TM2C with TM2B (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). Consequently, the sharp turn between TM2B and 2C in the wild-type channel inner helix becomes straightened in the L97D mutant. These structural differences, along with the electrophysiological observation that the L97D mutant favors pore opening and has lower sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> deactivation, suggest that the L97D structure is in an intermediate state in which the pore inner helices are undergoing conformational changes towards opening but the channel's intracellular gate remains shut, deactivated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. With the gating ring constriction alleviated, we expect that the inner helix of the open pore undergoes a similar bending movement at the glycine hinge with TM2B and 2C moving concurrently. A working model for the open pore can therefore be generated by applying the inner helices bending observed at Gly92 of L97D mutant onto the wild-type pore and allowing TM2B and 2C to move as a rigid body (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). In this open pore model, Leu117 is rotated away from the ion permeation pathway, yielding a larger entrance at the gate."

The GsuK inner helix has two different hinge points in response to external stimuli, allowing the pore to adopt an open, closed, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-deactivated states. The GusK pore dilates open in a very different direction as compared to MthK or Kv channels (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jiang et al., 2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Long et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ye et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A,B</a>). This reversed dilation of pore opening between GsuK and MthK can be attributed to the differences in the relative orientation between the gating ring and the pore as shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>. As current structural studies of RCK-regulated gating suggest that the expansion of the gating ring upon activation is mechanically coupled to the pore opening (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ye et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Yuan et al., 2011</a>), then the inner helix movement in different directions is expected between GsuK and MthK."

The likely source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is contamination of the chemicals used for protein purification and crystallization. Single channel recordings, however, showed a lower apparent affinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with a K<sub>1/2</sub> of about 200 \u03bcM. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the protein crystals were grown in a detergent environment whereas channel recording was performed in a lipid membrane. As lipids are known to be important for membrane protein stability, their presence may be necessary to stabilize the GsuK pore in an open state and, therefore, give rise to a lower efficacy of Ca<sup>2+</sup> deactivation. A possible region in GsuK for lipid interactions is the stretch of positively charged residues surrounding the closed gate at the carboxyl terminus of the inner helix, which could potentially interact with the phospholipid head groups and influence channel gating."

The Slo2 inner helix contains a conserved Pro at the position equivalent to the helix breaking Leu97 of GsuK, suggesting a similar inner helix break. NAD<sup>+</sup> has also been shown in a recent study to modulate Na<sup>+</sup> activation in Slo2 by binding at the same nucleotide site in RCK2 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tamsett et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, the relative orientation between the transmembrane pore and the gating ring in Slo channels, and consequently pore opening mechanism, may have a closer resemblance to GsuK than MthK. One piece of evidence is that the acidic Asp90 residue in the S0\u2013S1 loop of the BK channel transmembrane pore has been shown to interact with the Glu374/Glu399 Mg<sup>2+</sup> site from the neighboring subunits (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). Docking of the Kv channel pore onto the BK gating ring using MthK as a model would position such interaction within the same subunit (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wu et al., 2010</a>), but is otherwise possible if using GsuK as a structural model."

Low open probability and small single channel conductance can both contribute to the lack of channel activity in electrophysiological recording. Our recent study of the MthK channel demonstrated that mutations at Ala88 on the MthK inner helix can have dramatic effects on single channel conductance and open probability\u2014replacing Ala88 with a larger hydrophobic residue such as Leu significantly reduces both whereas the opposite effect is seen with a negatively charged Asp residue (<a href=\"#bib34\">Shi et al., 2011</a>). The equivalent residue in GsuK is Leu97, which we reasoned could potentially be the cause of low channel activity. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at the assembly interface of GsuK also implies a potential gating role. To this end, we introduced an L97D mutation to enhance the channel conductance and/or open probability and also performed single channel recordings in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. As the results showed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion initially presented in the patching solutions is the main cause of low channel activity."

Giant liposome was obtained by air drying 2\u20133 \u00b5l of liposome sample on a clean cover slip overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by rehydration in bath solution at room temperature. Patch pipettes were pulled from Borosilicate glass (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) to a resistance of 8\u201312 M\u2126 upon filled with the pipette solution containing 150 mM NaCl (for recordings shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>) or KCl (for recordings shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 buffered with KOH or NaOH. The standard bath solution contains 150 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4 buffered with KOH. A giga seal (&gt;10 G\u2126) was obtained by gentle suction when the patch pipette attached to the giant liposome. To get a single layer of membrane in the patch, the pipette was pulled away from the giant liposome and the tip was exposed to air for 1\u20132 s. Membrane voltage was controlled and current recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier with a Digidata 1322A converter (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Currents were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. Only patches containing a single channel with P<sub>o</sub>&gt;0.85 in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and having its intracellular side facing the bath solution were used for further experiments. In the study of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> deactivation, various concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> were added to the bath solution. The free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the range of 0\u2013100 \u00b5M was controlled by mixing 1 mM EGTA with an appropriate amount of CaCl<sub>2</sub> calculated using the software MAXCHELATOR (<a href=\"http://maxchelator.stanford.edu\">http://maxchelator.stanford.edu</a>). No EGTA was added in the bath solution for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] above 100 \u03bcM. Most recordings were performed with symmetrical KCl except for the selectivity measurements in which KCl in the pipette solution was replaced by 150 mM NaCl."

GsuK is closely related the bacterial MthK channel and also related to the eukaryotic Slo family of K<sup>+</sup> channels that includes Slo1 (BK), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> channel. However, unlike these channels, these authors show that GsuK is inhibited by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and weakly up-regulated by ADP and NAD<sup>+</sup>. The authors obtained X-ray crystal structures of several forms of the channel including the intracellular gating ring formed from a tetramer of two tandemly linked RCK domains, and the nearly full-length channel that includes the transmembrane domains and the gating ring. While generally the structures are similar to the previously crystalized MthK channels, they reveal a number of very interesting differences and unique observations."

This produces a second bundle crossing, and presumed gate, more intracellular than previously found. The structure of a mutant channel, L97D, suggests that the inner helices move in a different direction from MthK and Kv channels, perhaps because the gating ring is rotated relative to the transmembrane domains. The authors observe density (modeled as AMP) that likely corresponds to a nucleotide binding site, and they demonstrate apparent NAD<sup>+</sup> and ADP-dependent transport by these channels using Rb fluxes. In addition, the authors observe Zn coordinated by two His and two Cys sidechains in the RCK domain, and another ion modeled as Ca. Because none of these ions or nucleotide were added during purification or crystallization, it would appear that each originated from the <i>E. coli</i> cytoplasm and/or culture medium and are very tightly bound to the protein. The inhibitory Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site is in a different place than the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site of MthK and close to the site in BK that produces channel activation."

In particular, the differences in structure and mechanism with other channels in this family were unexpected, and could change the paradigm for how we think about the molecular mechanisms of gating in this family of channels. The results would also be of broad interest to people working on other ligand regulated enzymes. The work is well done and nicely presented. However, the authors' discussion and interpretation of gating mechanism is, in general, not well substantiated by the functional data that accompanies presentation of the structure, and this will require revision. The majority of these significant problems arise from over interpretation and over generalization between different channels. While they should be correctable without further experiments, a substantial rewrite will be required. A suitably revised paper would be an important contribution to the field.
