Here we have developed a novel single-molecule fluorescence approach to directly observe interactions and stoichiometries in protein complexes from cell extracts and from in vitro synthesized components. We show that up to 50 cavins associate on a caveola. However, rather than forming a single coat complex containing the three cavin family members, single-molecule analysis reveals an exquisite specificity of interactions between cavin1, cavin2 and cavin3. Changes in membrane tension can flatten the caveolae, causing the release of the cavin coat and its disassembly into separate cavin1-cavin2 and cavin1-cavin3 subcomplexes. Each of these subcomplexes contain 9 \u00b1 2 cavin molecules and appear to be the building blocks of the caveolar coat. High resolution immunoelectron microscopy suggests a remarkable nanoscale organization of these separate subcomplexes, forming individual striations on the surface of caveolae."

Here we have developed a novel single-molecule fluorescence approach to directly observe interactions and stoichiometries in protein complexes from cell extracts and from in vitro synthesized components. We show that up to 50 cavins associate on a caveola. However, rather than forming a single coat complex containing the three cavin family members, single-molecule analysis reveals an exquisite specificity of interactions between cavin1, cavin2 and cavin3. Changes in membrane tension can flatten the caveolae, causing the release of the cavin coat and its disassembly into separate cavin1-cavin2 and cavin1-cavin3 subcomplexes. Each of these subcomplexes contain 9 \u00b1 2 cavin molecules and appear to be the building blocks of the caveolar coat. High resolution immunoelectron microscopy suggests a remarkable nanoscale organization of these separate subcomplexes, forming individual striations on the surface of caveolae."

Furthermore, cavin2 and cavin3 exist in separate stripes on a caveolae. Gambin et al. also stretched the cell membrane by forcing cells to take in extra water, and showed that this caused the cavin coat to peel away from the caveolae and break down into distinct cavin1-cavin2 and cavin1-cavin3 building blocks."

The surface of adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and many other cell types is characterized by a dense covering of these small invaginations with a characteristic striated coat, as viewed by electron microscopy, and by the presence of membrane proteins termed caveolins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Peters et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kurzchalia et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rothberg et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Way and Parton, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Scherer et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Parton and Del Pozo, 2013</a>). Three caveolins are present in mammalian cells with caveolin-1 (CAV1) and caveolin-3 (CAV3) essential for caveolar formation in nonmuscle and muscle cells respectively. Caveolins bind cholesterol and fatty acids and form homo-oligomers required for caveolar formation. Approximately 140 CAV1 molecules associate with a single caveola in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005</a>) and in a model prokaryotic system upon caveolin expression (<a href=\"#bib36\">Walser et al., 2012</a>). Genetic ablation of caveolins in mice has diverse cellular consequences with impact upon numerous signal transduction pathways and lipid dysregulation. Human patients lacking CAV1 show a severe lipodystrophy while CAV3 mutations, many of which disrupt caveola formation in muscle, are associated with a number of muscle diseases."

Cavin1/polymerase transcript release factor (PTRF), cavin2/SDPR (serum deprivation response protein), cavin3/SRBC (serum deprivation response factor-related gene product that binds to C-kinase) and cavin4/MURC (muscle-restricted coiled-coil protein) are cytoplasmic proteins characterized by conserved putative N-terminal coiled coil domains (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hansen and Nichols, 2010</a>). Cavin1 was originally identified as a nuclear protein that can dissociate paused ternary transcription complexes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jansa et al., 1998</a>), while cavin2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gustincich and Schneider, 1993</a>) and cavin3 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Izumi et al., 1997</a>) were identified as protein kinase C (PKC) substrates and have been suggested to function in the targeting of PKC to caveolae. Cavin4 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ogata et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Tagawa et al., 2008</a>). The cavin proteins have been shown to co-associate and form a cytosolic complex(es) in cells lacking CAV1 (or CAV3), but are recruited to the cell surface to stabilize caveolae in cells expressing CAV1. Ablation of cavin1 expression causes loss of caveolae with CAV1 being released into the bulk membrane whereas expression of cavin1 or cavin2 in cells lacking cavins but expressing endogenous CAV1 is sufficient to generate caveolae (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hill et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hansen et al., 2009</a>).

Given the recent identification of the cavin cytoplasmic coat, essential for the formation and regulation of caveolae, one could hypothesize that CAV1 would associate with the cavin complex and aid in generating the striated coat. Furthermore, this cavin coat may provide a possible mechanism for spatial and temporal regulation of caveola formation: caveolae form at the plasma membrane as caveolins and cavins associate, rather than earlier in the exocytic pathway (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hill et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hayer et al., 2010</a>). In addition, the dissociation of the cavin coat complex could potentially provide a mechanism to disassemble caveolae. This may be crucial for caveolar function in setting membrane tension and in mechanosensing as increased membrane tension causes caveolar flattening and dissociation of cavin1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sinha et al., 2011</a>). However, the mechanisms underlying the formation of the cavin complex(es), their stoichiometry and association with caveolae are all unknown."

Those studies required labeling of recombinantly expressed purified proteins, which in the case of the cavin complex is difficult (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hansen et al., 2009</a>). We have taken an alternative approach to obtain the stoichiometry of the cavin complex and the interactions between the members of the cavin family (cavin1, cavin2, cavin3) directly from cell extracts. We could observe fascinating behaviour of the cavin members, with exquisite segregation of interactors and defined stoichiometries in mixed oligomers. By combining these experiments with novel electron microscopy techniques we show the surprising existence of two distinct cavin complexes, cavin1-2 and cavin1-3. Remarkably, the two complexes co-interact with individual caveolae but associate within distinct striated nanodomains."

In brief, the brownian motion of freely diffusing proteins brings them in and out of the confocal detection volume created by two lasers that simultaneously excite the GFP and the Cherry fluorophores. When fluorescent proteins transit through the focal volume the emission of GFP and Cherry fluorophores is detected simultaneously on two separate single-photon counting detectors. The measurement generates a highly temporally resolved (100 ns) fluorescence time trace, binned in 100 ms time intervals to obtain sufficient signal/noise ratio. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> the signal obtained for co-expressed cavin1-GFP and cavin1-Cherry shows coincident bursts of fluorescence with large amplitudes. The presence of the two fluorophores at the same time in the focal volume demonstrates that the cavin1 proteins self-interact. However, these data alone are not sufficient to distinguish between a dimer and higher order structures. In order to extract this information, each burst of fluorescence can be analysed for intensity of GFP and Cherry signals and duration of the burst. The former analysis is based on the assumption that multiple fluorescent proteins are brighter than individual GFP/Cherry. The detailed analysis of the amplitude of each burst should allow us to calculate the number of proteins in a complex. In the burst duration analysis we expect time-trajectories of proteins to be different for small and larger oligomers, as large protein complexes will diffuse slower and spend more time in the focal volume. This is quantified burst-by-burst by correlating the fluorescent signal intensity as done in Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and allows extraction of residence times in the focal volume for proteins or protein oligomers."

The open format of cell-free protein expression enables real time observation of protein production, folding and interactions.

After 2 hr of expression, the sizes and brightness of cavin1-GFP assemblies were very similar to the ones obtained for MCF-7 cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that we could use the cell-free system to reproduce the behaviour of cavin oligomerization. The time-trace of cavin production contains additional information. Surprisingly, we found that most of the cavin1 protein assembled into oligomers within the first 15 min while the concentration was still below 10 nM (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The observed segregation between cavin2 and cavin3 was so unexpected that we decided to use an alternative biophysical method to analyse interactions between cavin2 and 3. In order to detect even weak but potentially relevant biological interactions we employed ALPHAScreen (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay Screen). This sensitive bead-based proximity assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>) is able to detect interactions in a wide range of affinities (from pM to mM) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eglen et al., 2008</a>). When used for protein\u2013protein interaction analysis the approach typically involves purified proteins (<a href=\"#bib35\">Waller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mackie and Roman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Demeulemeester et al., 2012</a>). In our case, we analysed interactions of protein pairs directly after their co-expression in the cell-free system and utilized GFP and myc tags for capture of the proteins on the reporter beads (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sierecki et al., 2013</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>, co-expression of cavin1 and 2 or cavin1 and 3 resulted in a very strong positive signal. However, no interaction between cavin2 and 3 was detected using this approach. This was confirmed by classical biochemistry and pull-downs from MCF-7 cells as shown in <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>. Taken together these results indicate that cavin2 and 3 do not interact with each other, either in vitro or in vivo. This is a surprising finding that could potentially indicate that cavin1 operates as a bridging factor between cavin2 and 3. To test this idea we repeated the ALPHAscreen assay where we measured the binding of cavin2 and 3 under conditions of cavin1 co-expression. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a> shows that the presence of cavin1 did not enhance the interaction of cavin2 and 3. To further corroborate this finding we performed single-molecule coincidence analysis where co-expression titration of unlabeled cavin1 to a fixed ratio of cavin2-GFP/cavin3-Cherry was monitored. The total fluorescence of GFP and Cherry cavin2/3 decreased as more cavin1 was co-expressed reflecting competition of the templates for the translational machinery. However no mixed oligomers containing both cavin2 and cavin3 were produced (data not shown). To verify this result in mammalian MCF-7 cells, we next expressed cavin2-Cherry together with cavin3-GFP in the presence of non-fluorescent cavin1-FLAG. Supporting our in vitro findings we observed that the vast majority of the cavin2 and cavin3 proteins do not interact even when cavin1 is co-expressed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These findings suggest the existence of previously undetected segregation in cavin oligomers."

Microscopic analysis revealed that cavin1 was now located at the plasma membrane but a fraction of CAV1-labeled structures decorated with cavin1 proteins were found in the cytoplasm, presumably reflecting the dynamic nature of caveolae in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boucrot et al., 2011</a>).

We observed intensely fluorescent puncta in the supernatant of CAV1-GFP transfected cells. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, the intensity of these puncta reaches values that are 150 to 200-fold higher than the brightness of a single GFP. As caveolae contain up to 180 CAV1 proteins, this corresponds well to the expected brightness of fully-assembled caveola (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, we performed dual-colour coincidence experiment between cavin1-Cherry and CAV1-GFP. The presence of a large coincident peak shows that most of the cavin1-Cherry co-diffuses with CAV1-GFP. As cavin1 does not associate with CAV1 in non-caveolar cellular compartments, such as when CAV1 is moving along the secretory pathway or if caveolae are disassembled (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hill et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hayer et al., 2010</a>) we are confident that these represent bona fide caveolae. The coincidence peak is centred between C = 0.25 and C = 0.3, indicating that each caveola contains three to four times more CAV1 than cavin1. This observation corroborates the brightness analysis that demonstrates that the CAV1 signal is 3.5 times brighter than that of cavin1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Both methods suggest that the number of cavin1 per caveolae is estimated, again, between 40 and 50."

We observed coincidental diffusion of cavin2 and cavin3 indicating that they were part of the same assembly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The brightness and physical size of the cavin2-cavin3 complex correspond to a mixed coat of cavins formed on a single caveola.

Identical results were obtained when cavin2-Cherry and cavin3-GFP were transfected into HeLa cells that express endogenous CAV1 and cavin1 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

A single complex made of only 50 cavin1 proteins would be sufficient to wrap around a caveola, possibly as a loose mesh. However it is possible that the cavin1 complex produced in the absence of their CAV1 membrane target represents an artificial dead-end product. We therefore took advantage of hypo-osmotic treatment to dissociate the caveolae-associated cavin1 complex from the plasma membrane and to study the properties of the released native cavin complex."

Cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from cells before and after the treatment and were subjected to single-molecule analysis. The dual-colour experiment showed that the cavin1 oligomer recovered in the cytosolic fraction diffuses much faster than the caveolae bound protein: the apparent size of the cavin1 complex is reduced to \u2039 30 nm (calculated as diameter of a diffusing spherical object) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Yet the protein remained oligomeric, as all fluorescent events register both fluorophores (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The distribution of burst brightness showed that the observed oligomers are composed of 9 \u00b1 2 cavin1 proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This suggests that the cavin coat is actually made of multiple stable subcomplexes that can be released from the caveolae without being disassembled into monomers. Because the cavins have such a high propensity to oligomerise, it is possible that the subcomplexes would form in the cytosol before reaching the CAV1-rich membrane, and that the subcomplexes can reversibly assemble on a caveola."

We observed rare oligomers (&gt;15%) made of cavin1-only (red peak in histograms), but not oligomers made of cavin2-only or cavin3-only. The single-molecule coincidence histogram shows clearly that cavin3 remains bound to cavin1, and cavin2 bound to cavin1, and that these two subcomplexes detach separately from the membrane. This was confirmed by classical biochemistry and pull-downs as shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Interestingly, even the size of the two subcomplexes differs, with cavin1-cavin1 and cavin1-cavin3 forming oligomers of similar size (20 nm) that are significantly smaller than the cavin1-cavin2 sub-complex (30 nm). The complete lack of co-diffusion indicates that subcomplexes do not form direct interactions in solution; it also suggests that on the membrane, they do not bind strongly to form stable mixed structures."

We believe that the contribution of endogenous proteins must be minor because of the striking consistency in the size of the complexes observed both for cavins and caveolins in our different systems (<i>Leishmania</i> cell-free system, MCF-7 cells that lack endogenous cavin proteins, and MDCK cells that natively express cavins). The comparison of results obtained in <i>in vitro</i> and in vivo systems shows clearly that each of the cavin proteins has an intrinsic property for self-association to form stable oligomers. After synthesis, in vitro large oligomers are formed at very low concentration (&lt;10 nM, see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that cavins would form the same oligomers at endogenous levels. Most importantly, recent studies using biochemical approaches (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ludwig et al., 2013</a>) show striking agreement with our observations. A ratio of CAV1 to cavin of 4:1 determined biochemically (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ludwig et al., 2013</a>) is in good agreement with the brightness analysis and CAV1-cavin1 coincidence data presented here. Similarly, the ratio of cavin1 to cavin3 of \u223c2:1 is in excellent agreement with the result obtained from quantitative pull-downs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ludwig et al., 2013</a>). The same ratio of 2:1 of cavin1 to cavin2 observed in subcomplexes released from caveolae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) is similar to that reported in <a href=\"#bib20\">Ludwig et al. (2013)</a> but notably in the absence of caveolae more variable ratios are observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> in MCF-7 and cell-free systems). The studies indicate that the number of cavin proteins in the caveolar coat is relatively low, considering the number of CAV1 proteins within a caveola, and compared to the other protein coats such as clathrin (made of 30 + triskelias, approximately 200 subunits)."

Cavin1 is believed to form trimers, possibly through a coiled-coil domain (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ludwig et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that each sub-complex may be composed of three trimers. Our data clearly shows however, that cavin2 and cavin3 are not present in the same assemblies with cavin1: the sub-complexes are mutually exclusive for cavin2 or cavin3. Furthermore, cavin2 and cavin3 also segregate spatially on the surface of caveolae as revealed by high resolution immunoelectron microscopy. This segregation is consistent with the formation of striations as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. Thus stable units of cavin1-cavin2 and cavin1-cavin3 can come together on the membrane to regulate the formation of the curved caveolar structure."

But this does not mean that the cavin complex will be fully formed before interacting with caveolae. Expression in cells lacking caveolins may reflect an artificial situation as cavins and caveolins are generally expressed together in vivo. We believe the large complexes formed under these conditions may be rare in vivo, possibly explaining the slow association of expressed cavin with newly-arrived caveolin at the plasma membrane (25 min) when fluorescently-tagged cavin is expressed in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hayer et al., 2010</a>). The size of the cavin1 complex in the absence of CAV1 shows a broader size distribution and can be even larger than the size of a cavin1-CAV1 containing particle, where the presence of CAV1 appears to condense the complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> vs <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, raw data presented in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This observation suggests that the 50-mer cavin1 complexes form a more heterogeneous population in terms of their size and shape, which become more tightly organized when bound to CAV1. The fact that oligomers of cavin1 form so readily in the cell-free expression system (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) suggests that the subcomplexes could be pre-assembled rapidly in the cytosol, before reaching the CAV1-rich domains at the membrane. We hypothesize that a combined interaction with membranes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hansen et al., 2009</a>) and caveolin itself will result in recruitment of the subcomplexes to the budding caveolae, where they can be assembled into the striated structures observed on intact caveolae (this study and <a href=\"#bib20\">Ludwig et al., 2013</a>)."

We show that the cavin coat dissociates into stable sub-elements, cavin1/cavin2 and cavin1/cavin3 subcomplexes with a well-defined size of 9 \u00b1 2 cavin proteins. Interestingly, based on the observed residence times in the focal volume the complexes have slightly different sizes with cavin1-cavin1 20 nm, cavin1-cavin2 30 nm and cavin1-cavin3 20 nm. These sizes are calculated based on the assumption that the diffusing objects are spherical, which remains an oversimplification until further structural information is available. The cavin sub-oligomers are very stable and the proteins remain associated even after caveola disassembly, with few monomers detected in solution, as shown by the distribution of sizes; all cavin proteins are associated with objects of apparent size greater than 15 nm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). By high resolution immuno-EM and quantitative spatial analysis we show for the first time that cavin2 and cavin3 label distinct subdomains of single caveolae. The preferential labeling of spatially-distinct linear elements raises the possibility that the cavin1/cavin2 and cavin1/cavin3 complexes actually make up the caveolar striations seen by high resolution SEM and deep etch electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib28\">Peters et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rothberg et al., 1992</a>) consistent with EM observations with miniSOG-cavin fusion proteins (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ludwig et al., 2013</a>). These striated \u2018nanodomains\u2019 could be released from (\u2018peel off\u2019) the caveolae/membrane in response to membrane stretch. We speculate that this could potentially release two distinct subcomplexes, each able to reach distinct cellular destinations or interact with different partners. These interactions could be further regulated by additional post-translational modifications to individual cavins. An additional possibility is that the properties of individual caveolae can be modulated by their ratio of cavin1, 2, and 3 subcomplexes to vary their individual properties, including stability or morphology."

In contrast to other coat proteins, such as clathrin, which form a very dense basket-like network in a cooperative and stepwise process through protein\u2013protein interactions and binding to membrane components and then is disassembled into individual triskelia in an ATP-dependent process, we hypothesize that caveolar assembly relies on association of pre-oligomerized cavin subcomplexes that give rise to the unique caveolar striations. Further functional characterization of the cavin subcomplexes should prove illuminating in understanding the diverse roles of caveolae."

Cremades, <i>Cell</i> (25 May 2012). Instead, our analysis conservatively states that the highest brightness reached by the oligomers gives an indication of the maximal number of proteins included in the oligomers. Because the profile of bursts remains exponential (linear decrease in the log-scaled graphs of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1, 3, and 4</a>), we conclude that the cavin1 oligomers are relatively homogeneous in brightness. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> showing the CAV1 data confirms this observation, as CAV1 proteins assemble into well-defined objects, caveolae. The fact that we observe brighter bursts with the CAV1, corresponding to their expected oligomerisation in caveolae, strengthen our conclusion that the cavin can form typically a 50-mer."

This approach proved to be valid for the GFP-only construct, as the residence times measured at single-molecule resolution matches perfectly the average GFP diffusion times measured by FCS at higher concentrations. When performed on A488-only molecules, the diffusion times were about 50 microseconds, also matching the ones observed at higher concentration using regular FCS. In the case of the cavin oligomer, the threshold does not create the lower limit for the residence times, as shown by the dissociation experiments in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Indeed, we obtain completely different profiles for the cavin1-cavin2 and cavin1-cavin3 subcomplexes, and the sizes deduced are all smaller than the ones measured for the cavin1 assembly before dissociation."
