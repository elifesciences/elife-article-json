This complex multi-dimensional amalgam of inputs enables continuous adjustment of root growth rates, direction, and metabolic activity that define a dynamic physical network. Current methods for analyzing root biology balance physiological relevance with imaging capability. To bridge this divide, we developed an integrated-imaging system called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots) that uses luminescence-based reporters to enable studies of root architecture and gene expression patterns in soil-grown, light-shielded roots. We have developed image analysis algorithms that allow the spatial integration of soil properties, gene expression, and root system architecture traits. We propose GLO-Roots as a system that has great utility in presenting environmental stimuli to roots in ways that evoke natural adaptive responses and in providing tools for studying the multi-dimensional nature of such processes."

This complex multi-dimensional amalgam of inputs enables continuous adjustment of root growth rates, direction, and metabolic activity that define a dynamic physical network. Current methods for analyzing root biology balance physiological relevance with imaging capability. To bridge this divide, we developed an integrated-imaging system called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots) that uses luminescence-based reporters to enable studies of root architecture and gene expression patterns in soil-grown, light-shielded roots. We have developed image analysis algorithms that allow the spatial integration of soil properties, gene expression, and root system architecture traits. We propose GLO-Roots as a system that has great utility in presenting environmental stimuli to roots in ways that evoke natural adaptive responses and in providing tools for studying the multi-dimensional nature of such processes."

Depriving the plants of a nutrient called phosphorous caused the roots to grow more horizontally than when phosphorus is plentiful, presumably to allow the plants to expand their search for phosphate in the upper layers of the soil, where this nutrient is usually more abundant. On the other hand, a shortage of water caused the roots to grow more vertically to access water stored deeper in the soil. GLO-Roots can also be used to measure the water content of soil at different depths and how this influences the architecture of the root."

This gravity set-point angle is controlled by auxin biosynthesis and signaling and can be regulated by developmental age and root type (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rosquete et al., 2013</a>).

Based on computational modeling and field studies, the \u2018steep, deep, and cheap\u2019 ideotype proposed by Lynch and colleagues may provide advantages to the plant for capturing water and elements like nitrogen that are water soluble and therefore tend to move in the soil column with water. This ideotype consists of highly gravitropic, vertically oriented roots that grow deep in the soil column and develop large amounts of aerenchyma, which reduces the overall metabolic cost of the root system (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lynch and Wojciechowski, 2015</a>). Other nutrients, like phosphorus, which have limited water solubility and are tightly bound to soil particles, usually accumulate in the top layers of soil and favor root systems that are more highly branched and shallow. The low-phosphorus ideotype effectively increases root exploration at the top layers of soil (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lynch and Wojciechowski, 2015</a>). Modeling of root system variables shows that optimum architecture for nitrogen and phosphorus uptake is not the same (<a href=\"#bib39\">Postma and Lynch, 2014</a>) and suggests tradeoffs that may affect the evolution of root architecture as a population adapts to a particular environmental niche (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lalibert\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>)."

In addition, root systems have complexity beyond their architecture that needs to be incorporated into our understanding of plant\u2013environment interactions. Primary and lateral roots exhibit different stress response programs in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Duan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tian et al., 2014</a>) and may play specialized roles in water and nutrient uptake. Thus, it is important to develop methods that allow for a multidimensional characterization of the root system that includes growth, signaling, and interactions with other organisms. Furthermore, physiological parameters that affect whole-plant responses to the environment, such as transpiration, are likely integrated into such processes, thus, requiring a more holistic approach to studies of root function."

GLO-Roots is an integrated system composed of custom growth vessels, luminescent reporters, and imaging systems. We use rhizotrons that have soil volumes equivalent to small pots and support growth of <i>Arabidopsis</i> from germination to senescence. To visualize roots, we designed plant\u2013codon-optimized luciferase reporters that emit light of different wavelengths. To visualize reporter expression, plants are watered with a dilute luciferin solution and imaged afterwards. We have built a custom luminescence-imaging system that automatically captures images of rhizotrons held vertically. The signal from each reporter is distinguished using band-pass filters held in a motorized filter wheel, which enables automated acquisition of images from plants expressing both structural and environmentally or developmentally responsive reporters. We have also developed GLO-RIA (Growth and Luminescence Observatory Root Image Analysis), an ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib44\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>) plugin that allows for automated determination of (among other traits) root system area, convex hull, depth, width, and directionality, a metric which quantifies the angle of root segments with respect to gravity. GLO-RIA is also able to relate root system parameters to local root-associated variables such as reporter expression intensity and soil-moisture content."

Acrylic spacers provide a 2-mm space in which standard peat-based potting mix is added. Black vinyl sheets protect roots from light and rubber U-channels clamp the rhizotron materials together. Plastic racks hold the rhizotrons vertically and further protect the roots from light. Rhizotrons and rack are placed in a black tub and water is added, to a depth of about 2 cm, at the bottom to maintain moisture in the rhizotrons during plant growth. The volume of soil in the rhizotrons (100 cm<sup>3</sup>) is similar to small pots commonly used for <i>Arabidopsis</i> and supports growth throughout the entire life cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

These genes were curated from the literature and belong to a wide array of biological pathways including nutrient acquisition, hormone and light response and abiotic stress. Whole root and shoot samples were collected at the end of the light and dark periods (long-day conditions: 16-hr light, 8-hr dark) from plants grown in rhizotrons, pots, and petri dishes with two different media compositions: 1x Murashige and Skoog basal salts (ms) 1% sucrose or 0.25x ms, no sucrose (ms25). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the gene expression values showed a separation of soil- and gel-grown root systems in the first principal components (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 3</a>). In roots grown on gel-based media, we observed enhanced expression of genes associated with light-regulated pathways (flavonoid biosynthesis: <i>FLAVONOL SYNTHASE1, FLS1</i>, <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE, CHS</i> and photosynthesis: <i>RUBISCO SUBUNIT 1A, RBCS1A</i>, <i>CYCLOPHILIN 38, CYP38</i>), which is expected due to the exposure of gel-grown roots to light. In addition, genes associated with phosphorus nutrition (<i>LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1</i>, <i>LPR1, PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1, PHR1</i>) were less expressed in soil-grown roots (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting differences in nutrient availability between the different growth systems. Interestingly, shoot samples where not as clearly separated by growth media, and instead, time of day had a greater effect (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 4</a>). These data suggest root systems may be particularly sensitive to media conditions and indicate that rhizotron-grown root systems more closely approximate the biology of pot-grown plants than standard gel-based media. Shoot weight and primary root length were significantly reduced for gel-grown plants compared to rhizotron- or pot-grown plants suggesting significant differences in the biology of plants grown under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>)."

We compared traits of plants growing in vessels that hold similar volumes of soil but in different volumetric shapes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The number of lateral roots was significantly lower in pot- and cylinder-grown plants compared to rhizotron-grown plants (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), whereas primary root length of rhizotron and cylinder-grown plants was significantly greater than pot-grown plants (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

Luciferase (LUC) is an ideal reporter to visualize roots: (1) unlike fluorescent reporters, luciferase does not require high-intensity excitation light, which could influence root growth, (2) peat-based soil (a type of histosol) exhibits no autoluminescence but does autofluoresce at certain excitation wavelengths similar to GFP (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), (3) while GFP is very stable, and thus not well suited for imaging dynamic transcriptional events, the luciferase enzyme is inactivated after catabolism of luciferin, making it ideal for studying dynamic processes such as environmental responses.

Placing rhizotrons in this position would induce a gravitropic response in plants. Working with Bioimaging Solutions (San Diego, CA), we designed and built a luminescence-imaging system optimized for rhizotron-grown plants. GLO1 uses two PIXIS back-illuminated CCD cameras (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) to capture partially overlapping images of rhizotrons while a motorized stage automatically rotates the rhizotron to capture images of both sides (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). A composite image is generated from the images captured of each side; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> shows that approximately half of the root system is revealed on each side with few roots being visible on both sides. Apparently, the soil sheet is thick enough to block light from portions of the root system but thin enough to ensure its continuous structure can be compiled from opposite face views. We tested the ability of GLO1-generated images to reveal complete root systems by manually quantifying the number of lateral roots in excavated root systems of eight different plants and testing these results against estimates of lateral root number from images of the same plants visually inspected by four different persons. These comparisons revealed good correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.974) between actual lateral root counts and image-based estimation, indicating GLO1-generated root images provide an accurate representation of the in soil root system."

Manual measurement of root system width, depth, and average lateral root angle was determined by hand using ImageJ from an independent set of images corresponding to roots of several <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions growing in control conditions. We also used ArchiSimple (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pag\u00e8s et al., 2014</a>) to generate 1240 images of root system models with contrasting sizes and lateral root angles. Since these images are computationally generated, exact determination of root system parameters was possible. For both ground truth data sets, GLO-RIA quantification provided measurements that were well correlated for all three measured parameters (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5D\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 6</a>).

The first principal component captures differences in the distribution of widths along the vertical axis and separates Col-0 and Sha from Bay-0 root systems (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Bay-0 shows a homogenous distribution of widths along the vertical axis, while Sha and Col-0 are much wider at the top than bottom. PC2 seems to be capturing a relationship between width at the top and total depth and separates Sha root systems, which are wide at the top and deep from Col-0 root systems, which are wide but not as deep as Sha.

Root directionality was not significantly different between light- and dark-treated roots of the <i>phot1/2</i> double mutant (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>, lower panel, <a href=\"#SD17-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 3</a>). suggesting that blue light perception is indeed necessary for this response (<a href=\"#bib16\">Galen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Moni et al., 2014</a>). These data highlight the strong effects of light on root system architecture (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yokawa et al., 2013</a>), which GLO-Roots rhizotrons are able to mitigate."

First, shoots are exposed to the atmosphere and vapor pressure deficit is maintained at levels that allow for transpiration of water from the shoot. Second, soil in rhizotrons is exposed to air at the top and dries from the top-down; drying soil increases the volume occupied by air and reduces contact of root with liquid water, all of which are similar to changes in soil expected in the field during WD. Finally, as peat-based soil dries, its optical properties change, allowing moisture content to be approximated from brightfield images. We took advantage of the change in gray-scale pixel intensity to construct a calibration curve (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD14-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>) that quantitatively relates gray-scale pixel intensity to moisture content (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>); water content can be color coded in images with appropriate look-up tables (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Soil color was not affected by the presence or absence of roots (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Using this approach, water content in a rhizotron can be mapped and visualized in 2D (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). In the example shown, we can observe that a 22 DAS Bay-0 plant-depleted soil-moisture content locally around the root system (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

Plants were germinated, grown under control conditions then transferred to 29\u00b0C, and standing water was removed from the container holding the rhizotrons starting at 9 DAS or 13 DAS. Elevated temperature combined with water deficit is a common stress that modern crop varieties are poorly adapted to, thus, highlighting the importance of examining this combined treatment (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lobell et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ort and Long, 2014</a>). Plants were maintained in this WD regime until 22 DAS when luciferin solution was added and the plants imaged. At 13 DAS, lateral roots near the soil surface are already emerged (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A</a>) and 9 days of subsequent WD treatment caused lateral roots to show an increase in gravitropism leading to the development of a root system that was deeper and more vertically oriented (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Roots of Bay-0 plants showed similar responses, though the extent of change was less pronounced since Bay-0 roots are normally more vertically oriented (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Plants transferred at 9 DAS and grown for 13 days under WD showed less lateral root development in the top layer of soil (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). At this time point, lateral roots start to emerge (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) and early drought may lead to growth quiescence or senescence. Careful examination of roots in these regions showed evidence of small lateral root primordia populating the primary root (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). After 24 hr of re-watering (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>), these lateral root primordia reinitiated growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>)."

We observed that both conditions were sufficient to induce a change in root directionality indicating that the plant uses similar mechanisms to avoid heat and water-deficit-associated stresses (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next asked which regulatory pathways controlled the observed changes in lateral root directionality during simulated drought. Hydrotropism is a known environmental response that directs root growth towards wet regions of soil. <i>MIZ1</i> is an essential regulator of hydrotropism (<a href=\"#bib57\">Kobayashi et al., 2007</a>); however, <i>miz1</i> mutants had no significant effect on WD-induced changes in root directionality, compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#SD15-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>), indicating that this response was distinct from hydrotropism. Auxin is an important mediator of gravitropism and auxin treatment causes lateral roots to grow more vertically (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rosquete et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with this role for auxin, mutant plants with loss of function in the auxin receptor TIR1 (<a href=\"#bib11a\">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</a>) showed a near-random distribution of root angles and did not show changes in the root system directionality between WW and WD conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

This is consistent with other studies that show that <i>Brachypodium</i> has a typical grass root system (<a href=\"#bib50\">Watt et al., 2009</a>).

Previous work has suggested that auxin levels in <i>Brachypodium</i> roots are sub-optimal for growth (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pacheco-Villalobos et al., 2013</a>). Pacheco-Villalobos and colleagues suggest that, in <i>Brachypodium</i>, and contrary to what happens in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, ethylene represses <i>YUCCA</i> reducing the synthesis of auxin.

Using GLO-Roots, we are able to map in 2D coordinates the soil physical properties such as soil moisture together with root architecture traits such as directionality, growth rates, and gene expression levels. All this information is aggregated in layers for each x, y coordinate. Using GLO-RIA, we integrate this multilayer information, leveraging our ability to simultaneously and seamlessly investigate root responses to environmental stimuli such as soil-moisture content. Luciferases that emit light at different wavelengths allow for constitutive and regulated promoters to be studied together. Introduction of luciferase reporters into microbes provides an additional layer of information that is a readout of the association between organisms and how this might be affected by environmental conditions. The flexibility of the GLO-Roots system may enable additional dimensionality to our understanding of root biology. Other physical properties such as CO<sub>2</sub> or pH mapping in rhizotrons have already been enabled by using planar optodes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blossfeld et al., 2013</a>). It may be possible to engineer LUX-based reporters in microbes that are responsive to extracellular metabolites, creating microbial biosensors, and integration of such tools may enable root-exudation and nutrition to be analyzed in soil. Split-luciferase reporters have been engineered that allow bi-molecular interactions to be studied. Finally, molecular sensors analogous to F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors, termed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-sensors (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shaw and Ehrhardt, 2013</a>), may allow metabolite tracking dynamically through the root system. With additional innovation in the development of luciferase reporters, the GLO-Roots system will likely expand the repertoire of biological processes that can be studied over an expanded range of developmental time points and environmental conditions."

For example in rice, the IR64 paddy cultivar shows shallow root systems in upland fields, whereas Kinandang Patong, an upland cultivar, is deeper rooting (<a href=\"#bib48\">Uga et al., 2013</a>). Plants maintain a number of regulatory pathways that mediate changes in physiology during WD. Enhanced growth of root systems has been well characterized in field-grown plants; however, this has not been recapitulated in studies of gel-grown <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants. Thus, it has been unclear whether <i>Arabidopsis</i> simply responds to WD differently. Our results here show that <i>Arabidopsis</i> does indeed maintain a classical WD response that expands the root system and directs growth downward. Interestingly, under our stress regime, we did not observe a significant decrease in the relative water content of shoot tissues (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#SD19-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 5</a>), suggesting that the changes in root architecture were sufficient to provide access to deep water and prevent dehydration. Such changes in root growth are likely regulated through systemic and local signaling that involve auxin signaling but acts independently of known pathways that control moisture-directed root growth."

Environmental conditions are at least as complex as the plants they affect. Plant roots are exposed to a variety of environmental signals that change in time and space at very different scales that are integrated at the whole-plant system. It is an important challenge in biology to develop methods of growing and studying plants that present such stimuli in a manner that the plant is likely to encounter in nature. After all, the plants we study have evolved to survive through mechanisms that have been selected, over evolutionary time, in nature. It will be interesting for future studies to determine how other environmental stimuli affect root growth using GLO-Roots and whether these responses differ between accessions of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Identification of the genetic loci responsible for phenotypic variation in adult root phenotypes may identify the molecular basis for adaptive variation that exists in this species and potentially identify loci that are useful for breeding efforts needed for the next green revolution."

Using an electric paint gun, a fine mist of water is applied to the bare polycarbonate sheets. Then, using a 2-mm sieve (US Standard Sieve Series N\u00b0 10) a fine layer of PRO-MIX(r) PGX soil (Premier Tech, Canada) is applied. Excess soil is discarded by gently tapping the plastic against the table in a vertical position. Water is sprayed again onto the soil, then a second layer of Pro-MIX is applied as before. For P deficiency experiments, soil supplemented with 1 ml of 100 \u03bcM P-Alumina (control) and 0-P-Alumina (P deficient) was used. To prevent the soil from falling out of the bottom opening, a 3 \u00d7 6 cm piece of nylon mesh or paper towel is rolled into a 1-cm wide tube and placed at the bottom side of the rhizotron. The spacers are removed and replaced by clean spacers. The two faces of the rhizotron are carefully joined together and two rubber U-channels slipped on to clamp all pieces together. Assembled rhizotrons are placed into the rack inside the box and 500 ml of water is added to the box."

Seeds were suspended in 0.1% agar and 5 to 10 were sown using a transfer pipette in the rhizotron. A transparent acrylic sheet was mounted on top of the box and sealed with tape to ensure high humidity conditions that enable <i>Arabidopsis</i> germination. 3 days after sowing, the cover was unsealed to decrease humidity and allow the seedlings to acclimate to a dryer environment. From 3 days after sowing (DAS) to the time the first true leaves emerged, it was critical to ensure that the top part of the rhizotron remained humid for proper germination of the plants. Between three and five DAS, the rhizotrons were thinned leaving only the number plants required for that experiment, typically one, except for experiments examining root\u2013root interactions. Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments presented here, treatments were started 10 DAS. Plants were grown under long-day conditions (16-hr light/8-hr dark) using 20\u201322\u00b0C (day/night) and 150 \u03bcE m<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>. Two types of growth environments were used for experiments: a walk-in growth chamber with fluorescent lightning and a growth cabinet with white LED lights. Relative water content measurements were done as previously described (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barr and Weatherley, 1962</a>). Tomato seeds were germinated on filter paper and placed in rhizotrons. Peters fertilizer was added to tomato plants during normal watering."

Both media were buffered using 0.5 g/l MES and pH was adjusted to 5.7 with KOH. All plants were grown together in a growth cabinet with LED lights under long-day conditions (16-hr day/8-hr night). Root and shoot tissue was collected separately from individual plants at the end of the day (1 hr before the lights shut off) and at the end of the night (1 hr before lights came on). Three biological replicates were collected for each condition. RNA was extracted using the Plant RNA MiniPrepTM kit (ZYMO Research, Irvine, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions with on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen). cDNA was made using the iScript Advanced cDNA Synthesis for RT-qPCR kit (Bio-Rad) from 200 ng of total RNA. qRT-PCR was performed using a Fluidigm BioMarkTM 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC with the EvaGreen (Bio-Rad) fluorescence probe according to the Fluidigm Advanced Development Protocol number 37. For the analysis, all the reactions with no amplification (Ct = 999) were set to the maximal Ct for that assay type. The two technical replicates were then averaged and dCt values calculated using AT3G07480, AT4G37830, At1g13320, and At1g13440 as reference internal controls. PCA plots were generated with Devium Web (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dmitry Grapov, 2014</a>) using dCt values. dCT values were calculated as dCT = CT\u223cgene interest\u223c \u2212 mean(CT\u223creference gene\u223c).

The <i>attL1</i>-<i>attL2</i> entry clones containing plant\u2013codon-optimized coding sequence of <i>LUC2</i>, <i>PpyRe8</i>, <i>CBG99</i>, and <i>CBR</i> were synthesized by Genscript. A DNA fragment including the <i>UBQ10</i> promoter region and first intron was amplified from Col\u20130 genomic DNA with primers incorporating the attB1, attB4 combination sites at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032, respectively. The PCR product was then introduced into pDONR P4-P1R (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) through a classic Gateway BP-reaction. The resulting plasmid, the <i>attL1</i>-<i>attL2</i> entry clones with luciferase sequences, an empty <i>att</i>R2-attL3* entry clone and the destination vector dpGreenmCherry (<a href=\"#bib14\">Duan et al., 2013</a>) were used to construct <i>ProUBQ10</i>:LUC2o, <i>ProUBQ10:PpyRE8o</i>, <i>ProUBQ10:CBG99o</i>, and <i>ProUBQ10:CBRo</i> through Gateway LR reactions. The destination vector <i>dpGreenmCherry</i> contains a plasma membrane-localized mCherry coding sequence driven by the 35S promoter and is used as a selectable marker of transformation at the mature seed stage (<a href=\"#bib14\">Duan et al., 2013</a>).

The design was a joint effort with Bioimaging Solutions (San Diego, CA), which also built the system and wrote the acquisition software that drives all the mechanical parts of the system. The system is composed by two 2048 \u00d7 2048 PIXIS-XB cameras (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) mounted on top of each other to capture two fields of view encompassing approximately two 15 \u00d7 15-cm areas corresponding to the top or bottom of the rhizotron. The cameras are fitted with a Carl-Zeiss macro lens. A filter wheel with space for four, 76.2-mm filters is positioned in front of the cameras and controlled by a stepper motor allowing for automated changing of the filter wheel position. We used two 542/50 and 450/70 custom cut Brightline(R) band-pass filters (Semrock, Rochester, NY). In single color imaging mode, the filter wheel is operated without filters. Positioned in front of the filter wheel is a removable rhizotron holder mounted on a stepper motor. This stepper motor is also controlled by the GLO-1 software allowing automatic acquisition of images from both sides of the rhizotron sequentially. The whole-imaging system is enclosed in a light-tight black box with a door that allows loading and un-loading of rhizotrons."

This orientation is then used to build a distribution of directions by assigning the square of the orientation into the appropriate bin.

For example, in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, a large amount of gene expression data was obtained to determine if plants grown in a GLO1 setup were in a similar or different \u2018state\u2019 compared to plants grown in gels or pots. PCA shows results from plants grown in GLO1 and pots group together, and separately from the two gel-based experiments (which included MS or 25% MS salts). The authors are technically justified to conclude that GLO1 plants are more like pot-grown plants than like gel-grown plants, and they are free to view one as more \u2018natural\u2019 than the other. But the data more naturally support a different narrative. Within-treatment variation (variation between biological reps) is far greater than differences between gel and soil. (The spread of PC1, which explains 75% of the variance, is from -10 to 10 regardless of growth method or whether the samples were harvested at night or day.) Separation in PC2 supports the point the authors choose to make, which could be due entirely to MS salts being in the gels but not the soil. (MS contains 40 mM potassium nitrate, so it is not surprising that gene expression differs from soil-grown plants.) The authors should focus on explaining their method and its special features well. The readers will realize GLO1 is interesting and it is different but they will want to know how it works, how reliable and reproducible are the results, and what special studies it enables. Removing panels D-I from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and panel A from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> could make an effective introduction to the method with one figure."

First, how much wider is the luminescence signal? From the images shown, it is not possible to determine how far it spreads, but it must spread because it is unlikely that a single-pixel signal would be detectable in the images shown. If the luminescence signal is typically 5 pixels wide or 10, can parallel roots be distinguished? It is essential to include a rigorous assessment of the resolution. Is the resolution sufficient to images of microbes or to distinguish lateral root primordia?"

In the subsection \u201cImage Preparation\u201d, it is stated that images from the two cameras must be registered (though that standard image analysis term is not used) in order to create a continuous view. The steps taken sound like an affine transformation was applied, but it is also possible that a person is manually doing the shifting by eye. A one-pixel error is equivalent to shifting the image the distance of a root thickness. Is it true that each time point for each rhizotron requires manual registration of the images from two cameras? If not manual, how accurate is the registration method? If manual, how long does it take to process a single experiment?"

PCA shows results from plants grown in GLO1 and pots group together, and separately from the two gel-based experiments (which included MS or 25% MS salts). The authors are technically justified to conclude that GLO1 plants are more like pot-grown plants than like gel-grown plants, and they are free to view one as more \u2018natural\u2019 than the other. But the data more naturally support a different narrative. Within-treatment variation (variation between biological reps) is far greater than differences between gel and soil. (The spread of PC1, which explains 75% of the variance, is from -10 to 10 regardless of growth method or whether the samples were harvested at night or day.) Separation in PC2 supports the point the authors choose to make, which could be due entirely to MS salts being in the gels but not the soil. (MS contains 40 mM potassium nitrate, so it is not surprising that gene expression differs from soil-grown plants.) The authors should focus on explaining their method and its special features well. The readers will realize GLO1 is interesting and it is different but they will want to know how it works, how reliable and reproducible are the results, and what special studies it enables.

With the current analysis, we believe it is especially clear that substantial differences in gene expression exist for soil and gel-grown root systems.

It is essential to validate the data generated by GLO-RIA to a known ground truth, for example, a 3D printed model of a root system with known architecture. Alternatively, comparisons to manual measurements of the root system (root growth, directionality) or to measurements obtained through another independent approach could be used to validate data from GLO-RIA. The following papers provide examples of validation approaches (Topp et al., PNAS, 2013, 110(18): E1695-E1704</i>, <a href=\"http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/33\">http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/33</a> <i>and</i> <a href=\"http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/26/figure/F6\">http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/26/figure/F6</a><i>).</i>"

First, we manually quantified individual lateral root angles (measurements performed as marked in blue in the diagram in <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a>) in a set of 15 images (not originally part of the data set used in the manuscript) and calculated an average lateral root angle per root system. This value was compared with mean directionality values obtained using GLO-RIA. We also compared the manually measured root system width and depth with the same values obtained using GLO-RIA. To further extend the comparison of actual lateral root angles with the output of the directionality algorithm in GLO-RIA, we used ArchiSimple (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pag\u00e8s et al., 2014</a>) to generate a set of 1240 contrasting root systems that we used as ground truth models. Images of these root systems were then measured in GLO-RIA and compared to the actual root angles defined by ArchiSimple."
