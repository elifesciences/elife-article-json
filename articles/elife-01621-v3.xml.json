                    "text": "The exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs) elicited by potent stimulation is rapidly compensated by bulk endocytosis of SV membranes leading to large endocytic vacuoles (\u2018bulk\u2019 endosomes). Subsequently, these vacuoles disappear in parallel with the reappearance of new SVs. We have used synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double knock-out neurons, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is dramatically impaired, to gain insight into the poorly understood mechanisms underlying this process. Massive formation of bulk endosomes was not defective, but rather enhanced, in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The subsequent conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin coated buds on their surface and this process proceeded even after further clathrin knock-down, suggesting its independence of clathrin. These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1/3 and that operates during intense synaptic activity."

Subsequently, these vacuoles disappear in parallel with the reappearance of new SVs. We have used synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double knock-out neurons, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is dramatically impaired, to gain insight into the poorly understood mechanisms underlying this process. Massive formation of bulk endosomes was not defective, but rather enhanced, in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The subsequent conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin coated buds on their surface and this process proceeded even after further clathrin knock-down, suggesting its independence of clathrin. These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1/3 and that operates during intense synaptic activity."

The best understood relies on a protein called clathrin, and is thought to be essential for nervous system function. Recently, however, a mechanism of vesicle membrane endocytosis that does not involve clathrin was identified. This mechanism, called bulk endocytosis, involves reinternalizing large regions of the cell plasma membrane to generate large compartments called vacuoles, from which new synaptic vesicles eventually form. This mechanism has been observed when neurons fire at high frequency. The cellular processes underlying bulk endocytosis are not well understood, although several studies suggest proteins called dynamins are important."

Like any other form of endocytosis, bulk endocytosis involves membrane remodeling and membrane fission. Thus, several studies of bulk endocytosis have addressed the potential involvement of dynamin, a GTPase known to mediate endocytic membrane fission in multiple contexts including, most prominently, endocytic fission at neuronal synapses (<a href=\"#bib39\">Koenig and Ikeda, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ramaswami et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</a>). However, conflicting results have been reported. A role for dynamin, and more specifically for dynamin 1 has been supported by some studies (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clayton et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Xue et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nguyen et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, dynamin 1 is constitutively phosphorylated in resting nerve terminals and its Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered dephosphorylation upon synaptic stimulation results in its binding to the F-BAR domain containing protein syndapin/pacsin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anggono et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clayton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Koch et al., 2011</a>), which has also been implicated in bulk endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersson et al., 2008</a>).

It remains possible that other dynamins, dynamin 3 in particular, which is the other predominantly neuronal dynamin, may substitute for dynamin 1 in these neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ferguson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Raimondi et al., 2011</a>).

Conversion of bulk endosomes into new SVs does occur in these synapses, although less efficiently than in wild-type (WT) synapses. The partial impairment of this conversion is not further aggravated by the additional knock-down (KD) of clathrin, indicating the clathrin-independence of this process. These observations provide evidence for a pathway of SV reformation that predominates after strong stimulation and does not require clathrin mediated budding or dynamin 1 and 3."

Following the stimulus, a very robust recovery of SV number was already observed after 10 min of recovery in WT and Dyn3 KO synapses (<a href=\"#fig1 fig2\">Figures 1A and 2A,B</a>), with a corresponding decrease of HRP reaction product-positive large vacuoles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>), and this recovery continued thereafter (<a href=\"#fig1 fig2\">Figures 1A, 2A\u2013D</a>).

Interestingly, even at the end of the 90 s stimulation, the majority of the remaining SVs in WT and Dyn3 KO synapses were labeled, indicating that they had formed by endocytic recycling during the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). As SVs had been nearly depleted in Dyn1 KO and Dyn1/3 DKO synapses at this time point (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), one can conclude that in all four genotypes the high K<sup>+</sup> stimulus induces the exocytosis of all SVs, but that only at synapses containing dynamin 1 SV reformation occur during the stimulus, thus partially counteracting the loss of SVs (see also <a href=\"#bib20\">Ferguson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Raimondi et al., 2011</a>). The occurrence of newly reformed CTX-HRP reaction product-negative SVs after 10 and 30 min of recovery in synapses that lack Dyn1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) was surprising. In principle, nearly every new SV formed after the stimulus should be peroxidase reaction product positive as the contribution of new vesicle membrane delivered from the cell body is expected to be minimal over the time course of these experiments. Such occurrence may be explained by the stochastic nature of SV labeling and/or the all-or-none nature of the formation of peroxidase reaction product."

Bulk endosomes could be the direct source of SVs, or they may first fuse back to the plasma membrane from which new SVs could then bud by CME. To discriminate between these possibilities, cultures of all four genotypes were exposed to CTX-HRP only during the recovery phase, following a 90 s stimulus, and then analyzed at the 10 and 30 min time points (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013H</a>). In these samples, only very few large vacuoles were HRP labeled (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>), indicating that bulk endocytosis occurs nearly exclusively during the high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation. If the conversion of bulk endosomes to SVs during stimulation requires their prior fusion with the plasma membrane, using this protocol the majority of newly reformed SVs should be labeled. This was not the case, as the fraction of CTX-HRP labeled newly reformed SVs, relative to all SVs, was much lower than in samples incubated with CTX-HRP both during and after the stimulus (compare the solid to empty portions of the bars in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a> and in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, respectively, see also <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). These findings imply that during recovery a large pool of SVs reforms directly from the bulk endosomes that were generated during the stimulus. Note that the number of CTX-HRP positive SVs, that is SVs generated during post-stimulus endocytosis, was only modestly decreased in Dyn1 KO and Dyn1/3 DKO synapses relative to their controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>), suggesting that either clathrin/dynamin-dependent SV endocytosis is not involved in their formation or that dynamin/clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurring during the recovery can be sustained by dynamin 2 even though the levels of this dynamin isoform in neurons are very low compared to either dynamin 1 or 3 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ferguson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Raimondi et al., 2011</a>)."

For each condition, the entire pie (calculated by the data of fields A and B) represents the global SV pool that is present in nerve terminals before the stimulus, and which undergoes massive exocytosis with the stimulation. The sector delineated by a dotted line reflects the pool of SVs that was still missing at the time point of recovery examined, revealing a delay in SV reformation in the absence of the neuronal dynamins. The white sector of the pie represents SVs that are unlabeled by CTX-HRP. In spite of the absence of HRP reaction product, even these SVs are likely to be of endocytic origin given the complete depletion of SVs produced by the stimulus. As stated above, these vesicles are most likely unlabeled due to the less than 100% efficiency of labeling, as supported by the observation that the size of this pool roughly correlates with the number of recovered SVs. The black sector shows the CTX-HRP-labeled SVs reformed during the 90 s stimulus, while the striped sectors represent the labeled SVs generated during recovery (solid portions of the bars during recovery in fields A and B, subtracted by the solid portion of the K<sup>+</sup> bars). Within the striped sectors, the portion with red stripes represents the fractions of SVs that become labeled when CTX-HRP is added only after the stimulus (calculated from the solid portions of the bars of fields E and F), thus implying that the portion with black stripes represents SVs that form from bulk endosomes generated during the stimulus. Our conclusions from these comparisons are as follows: (1) SV reformation occurs even in the absence of Dyn1 and Dyn3, but this process is substantially delayed as shown by the missing portion of the pie; (2) No SV reformation occurs during the stimulus in the absence of Dyn1 or both Dyn1 and 3 (solid black sections), leading to complete SV depletion; (3) Reformation of SVs by endocytosis that occurs after the interruption of the stimulus is surprisingly similar in all genotypes (red stripes sector); (4) Most of the delay in recovery in dynamin KO neurons is due to a delay in the conversion from bulk endosomes to SVs (black stripes)."

This was surprising, as previous studies had proposed a role of the calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of dynamin 1 in bulk endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clayton et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Xue et al., 2011</a>). Since dynamin 2 is expressed in Dyn1/3 DKO neurons, dynamin 2 could in principle account for the bulk endocytosis occurring in these cells. However, dynamin 2 represents only a very minor fraction of total brain dynamin and its levels are not enhanced in Dyn1/3 DKO neurons (<a href=\"#bib53\">Raimondi et al., 2011</a>). While this issue could be solved by the conditional disruption of all the dynamins in neurons, the generation of dynamin triple KO synapses has so far proven unfeasible due to the very long half-life of dynamin in axon endings and to the neuronal death that occurs before nerve endings are completely depleted of dynamin 2 (our unpublished observations). The complete KO of all three dynamins was achieved in fibroblasts, as these cells can survive for weeks without any dynamin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Park et al., 2013</a>). Even in triple KO fibroblasts, other forms of endocytosis were not affected, while CME was blocked (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ferguson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Park et al., 2013</a>). We suggest that the two neuronal dynamins are specially adapted to support CME during stimulation, and that dynamin 2 may account for CME under resting conditions. This would explain why the massive accumulation of clathrin coated pits observed in Dyn1/3 KO cultures slowly disappear upon electrical silencing of the cultures."

One potential explanation is that mutant dynamin produces a potent dominant negative effect by sequestering dynamin interactors. Likewise, the reported strong global blocking effect on SV endocytosis of drugs that impair dynamin action (<a href=\"#bib49\">Newton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McCluskey et al., 2013</a>) may be explained by the prominent off-target effects of such drugs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Park et al., 2013</a>). Our results do suggest the involvement of dynamin 1, and by extension its stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation at synapses, in the reformation of SVs that occurs during stimulation, as this process, but not bulk endocytosis, is strikingly abolished by the absence of dynamin 1. This effect could be explained by a complete block of CME during stimulation, as our studies of dynamin mutant cells have consistently supported a critical role of dynamin in CME (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ferguson et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hayashi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Raimondi et al., 2011</a>).

The endocytic reaction described by <a href=\"#bib37\">Kittelmann et al. (2013)</a> following strong photostimulation is reminiscent of the bulk endocytosis described here. Interestingly, in that study the disappearance of the large vacuoles produced by the intense stimulus was delayed in a dynamin<sup>ts</sup> mutant at the restrictive temperature, reminiscent of the delay in the conversion of bulk endosome to SVs observed here at Dyn1/3 DKO synapses. In contrast, the ultrafast endocytic reaction reported by Watanabe et al. (<a href=\"#bib65\">2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2013b</a>) in either <i>C. elegans</i> or mouse neurons following a very short photostimulus was reported to be dependent on dynamin, at variance with the endocytic reaction observed in our study."

SVs are a highly specialized form of small vesicular carriers present in all cells. The prevailing general mechanism for vesicle budding in the secretory and endocytic pathways is the assembly on the donor membrane compartments of a \u2018coat\u2019, whose core and accessory subunits are responsible for two major functions: induction of bilayer deformation and protein cargo selection (<a href=\"#bib18\">Faini et al., 2013</a>). Among the well characterized coats, the only one so far for which there is evidence in SV generation from genetic, biochemical and microscopic observations, is the clathrin coat (<a href=\"#bib32\">Heuser and Reese 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Maycox et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shupliakov et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nonet et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Verstreken et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Heerssen et al., 2008</a>). However, our study suggests that clathrin-mediated buds are present only, or at least by far predominantly, on the nerve terminal plasma membrane. Furthermore, SV reformation from bulk endosomes occurs at Dyn1/3 DKO synapses is not further delayed after CHC KD."

The membranes of bulk endosomes are expected to be highly enriched in SV proteins, as they form by compensatory endocytosis after SV fusion. Thus, protein cargo selection may not be a critical function in this process and mechanisms that force membrane curvature may be sufficient to induce SV formation, albeit perhaps leading to SVs with a non-optimal protein composition and size. For example, proteins containing BAR domains (<a href=\"#bib24\">Frost et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Campelo et al., 2010</a>) or other membrane deforming proteins for which there is evidence in SV recycling may be involved. Direct reformation of SVs from beading and \u2018imprecise\u2019 cutting of tubular structures is a possibility, as supported by the slightly larger and more heterogeneous size of the SVs upon recovery from a massive stimulation. Peripheral membrane proteins such as the synapsins, which are enriched at the surface of SVs (<a href=\"#bib16\">De Camilli et al., 1983</a>), but are shed during the endocytic phase of their recycling, may also help budding of SVs from bulk endosomes via their bilayer penetrating ALPS motifs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Krabben et al., 2011</a>). Lipid-mediated mechanisms, that is metabolic changes in the bilayer leading to its spontaneous acquisition of curvature should also be considered. Importantly, however, we suggest that this mode of SV recycling functions only as a back-up mechanism during intense activity. At subsequent exo-endocytic cycles, CME may help regenerate SVs with precise size and molecular composition."

A direct role for dynamin in this process cannot be excluded, since in yeast the dynamin homologue Vps1 was implicated in endosomal sorting (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ekena et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chi et al., 2014</a>) and some studies have suggested roles for dynamin on endosomes in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hayden et al., 2013</a>). However, the conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs still occurs, albeit less efficiently, even in the absence of the two major neuronal dynamin isoforms, pointing to potential dynamin independent mechanisms. It is also possible that the delay in the conversion from bulk endosomes to SVs observed in Dyn1/3 DKO synapses may be an indirect effect of impaired dynamin function. For example, the overload of this pathway in the absence of CME may saturate it. Alternatively, the absence of dynamin may produce changes in signaling pathways that regulate SV formation from bulk endosomes. This possibility is supported by the changes that we previously observed in synapsin phosphorylation in Dyn1/3 DKO synapse (<a href=\"#bib53\">Raimondi et al., 2011</a>), which may in turn affect bulk endosome dynamics. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs will not only advance the field of synaptic transmission but also provide key new insight in fundamental mechanisms in vesicle biogenesis."

The authors use cultured neurons that are subjected to a massive, vesicle-depleting stimulus and then allowed to recover exocytosed membranes by endocytosis, partially in the presence of extracellular tracers. Analysis is carried out by quantitative EM, with conventional fixation/staining protocols being complemented by cryo-EM following high-pressure freezing."

I used some of the PDF images provided in the submission, and analyzed the diameters of labeled organelles in DKO and WT synapses. I performed this for two figures in which numerous such organelles are included, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. I only analyzed the 30 minute recovery images. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A, I</a> found that 57 of 60 organelles in the WT synapse had diameters of 10 pixels or below, corresponding to synaptic vesicles. In contrast, 18 of the 19 organelles I analyzed in the DKO synapse from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> had diameters of more than 10 pixels. I would interpret this as an indication that these synapses do not form synaptic vesicles, but rather smaller endosomes. This discrepancy is not as large in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, where about one third of the labeled DKO organelles are within the size range of the labeled WT organelles. Nevertheless, one can still conclude that the organelles forming in the DKO synapses are typically larger than synaptic vesicles.

In any case, we have now changed the following sentence of the Abstract by replacing \u201cshowing\u201d with \u201csuggesting\u201d: \u201cConversion of bulk endosomes into SVs during recovery was delayed, but not blocked, even after further clathrin knockdown, <strike>showing</strike> suggesting that this process is independent of clathrin-mediated budding. We have modified the title and we have been very cautious throughout the text. For example the last sentence of the Introduction (which we have not changed from the original submission) states: \u201cThese observations <span class=\"underline\">provide evidence</span> for a pathway of SV reformation that does not require dynamin/clathrin mediated endocytosis and that predominates after strong stimulation\u201d."
