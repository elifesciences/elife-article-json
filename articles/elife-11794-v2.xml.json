In this pathway, the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) complex promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of NCs remaining stalled in the 60S subunit. NC stalling is recognized by the Rqc2/Tae2 RQC subunit, which also stabilizes binding of the E3 ligase, Listerin/Ltn1. Additionally, Rqc2 modifies stalled NCs with a carboxy-terminal, Ala- and Thr-containing extension\u2014the 'CAT tail'. However, the function of CAT tails and fate of CAT tail-modified ('CATylated') NCs has remained unknown. Here we show that CATylation mediates formation of detergent-insoluble NC aggregates. CATylation and aggregation of NCs could be observed either by inactivating Ltn1 or by analyzing NCs with limited ubiquitylation potential, suggesting that inefficient targeting by Ltn1 favors the Rqc2-mediated reaction. These findings uncover a translational stalling-dependent protein aggregation mechanism, and provide evidence that proteins can become specifically marked for aggregation."

In this pathway, the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) complex promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of NCs remaining stalled in the 60S subunit. NC stalling is recognized by the Rqc2/Tae2 RQC subunit, which also stabilizes binding of the E3 ligase, Listerin/Ltn1. Additionally, Rqc2 modifies stalled NCs with a carboxy-terminal, Ala- and Thr-containing extension\u2014the 'CAT tail'. However, the function of CAT tails and fate of CAT tail-modified ('CATylated') NCs has remained unknown. Here we show that CATylation mediates formation of detergent-insoluble NC aggregates. CATylation and aggregation of NCs could be observed either by inactivating Ltn1 or by analyzing NCs with limited ubiquitylation potential, suggesting that inefficient targeting by Ltn1 favors the Rqc2-mediated reaction. These findings uncover a translational stalling-dependent protein aggregation mechanism, and provide evidence that proteins can become specifically marked for aggregation."

Such protein quality control processes are important for ensuring the health and fitness of cells and organisms. Recently, a new protein quality control mechanism was discovered that senses when a ribosome becomes jammed as it produces a new protein. This mechanism recycles the ribosome so it can make more new proteins. It also disposes of the stalled protein using a cell complex, called the ribosome-associated quality control complex, which is found in all eukaryotic organisms including yeast and humans. This protein complex consists of three subunits; one of which, called Rcq2, tags ribosome-stalled proteins with a \u201ctail\u201d that contains the amino acids alanine and threonine. However, the purpose of this tag was not clear."

The formation of these clumps also correlates with the activation of a stress response in the cell, indicating that these clumps create a signal that prompts the cell to protect itself in response to the accumulation of more abnormal proteins."

                        "text": "Under various circumstances, translating ribosomes can halt NC elongation and become stalled, such as upon translation of mRNA templates lacking stop codons, containing sequential suboptimal codons, or encoding homopolymeric Lys tracts (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Comyn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lykke-Andersen and Bennett, 2014</a>). Ribosome stalling poses a problem, as it can both reduce the pool of translation-competent ribosomes and give rise to aberrant\u2014and potentially toxic\u2014nascent polypeptide chains (NCs). To prevent these undesirable consequences from taking place, stalled ribosomes are rescued by factors that split the subunits, releasing the mRNA (for degradation by the exosome), the 40S subunit, and the 60S subunit stalled with a nascent peptidyl-tRNA conjugate, which is then targeted by the RQC complex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Comyn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lykke-Andersen and Bennett, 2014</a>). The RQC is minimally composed of the Ltn1 (Listerin in mammals), Rqc1, and Rqc2/Tae2 (NEMF in mammals) subunits (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Defenouillere et al., 2013</a>). How the RQC functions has only begun to be understood. According to the current model, Rqc2 first recognizes the stalled 60S and facilitates binding of the Ltn1 E3 ligase, which, in turn, ubiquitylates the aberrant NC (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lyumkis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Shen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Shao et al., 2015</a>). Next, in a manner dependent on Rqc1, the Cdc48/VCP AAA ATPase and its ubiquitin-binding cofactors are recruited to the complex and facilitate NC delivery to the proteasome for degradation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Defenouillere et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Verma et al., 2013</a>). It has been recently discovered that Rqc2 can, in addition, recruit Ala- or Thr-loaded tRNA to promote the C-terminal elongation of stalled NCs in a template- and 40S ribosomal subunit-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib28\">Shen et al., 2015</a>). Such 'CAT tails' have no defined sequence and are heterogeneous in length, forming a smear extending as much as 5\u2009kDa above the unmodified reporter band in SDS-PAGE. The physiological relevance of this process has remained unclear, however, as so far it has only been reported for Ltn1- or Rqc1-deficient cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Shen et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, the fate of CATylated NCs has remained unknown."

In one set, the reporters consist of a GFP-Flag-His3 fusion followed by a stop codon (K0), lacking stop codons (NS, for 'nonstop'), or followed by a 12 Lys track and stop codons (K12) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left panel, and [<a href=\"#bib4\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</a>]). Translation of NS and K12 reporters is believed to stall due to polyLys tract synthesis. In a second set of reporters, the Protein A ZZ domain (PtnA) is followed by a stop codon (STOP-Rz), by a wild type self-cleaving ribozyme sequence (NS-Rz), or by a mutant ribozyme (<i>rz</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, middle panel, and [<a href=\"#bib34\">Wilson et al., 2007</a>]). In the case of the NS-Rz reporter mRNA, translating ribosomes stall as they reach the 3\u2019end of the cleaved mRNA with no stop codons present; on the other hand, with the mutant <i>rz</i> reporter, the mRNA fails to be cleaved, allowing translation to proceed through an in-frame GFP sequence without stalling. In a third set of experiments, a GFP-12(Arg)-RFP fusion protein (GRR) was utilized (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right panel, and ref [<a href=\"#bib12\">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</a>]). In this case, stalling occurs as a result of the presence of multiple unpreferred Arg CGN codons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Letzring et al., 2013</a>). Despite their unrelated encoded protein sequences and distinct stalling mechanisms, we were able to observe slow-migrating species for all stalling reporters examined, but not their respective parental controls (e.g., K0, STOP-Rz). The formation of slow-migrating reporter species thus appears to be translational stalling-dependent."

Consistent with previous reports indicating that yeast amyloid aggregates are typically bound to the Hsp40/J protein, Sis1 (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib3\">Aron et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Park et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Yang et al., 2013</a>]), the binding of Sis1 to stalling reporters was readily apparent in extracts of a <i>ltn1</i>\u25b3 strain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Other chaperones, such as Hsp70 Ssa1 and the Hsp40/J-protein Ydj1, also co-immunoprecipitated (co-IP\u2019ed) with stalling reporters above background level but the differences were less marked and appeared more variable. Consistent with these observations, analysis of chaperones co-IP\u2019ed with the K12 stalling reporter expressed in a <i>ltn1</i>\u25b3 strain by mass spectrometry uncovered Sis1 among the most abundant hits, and with the apparent highest signal-to-noise ratio [<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> (Table SI)]. In contrast to the conspicuous co-IP of Sis1 with stalling reporters in <i>ltn1</i>\u25b3 cells, markedly less Sis1 was pulled down by anti-Flag antibody-conjugated beads from a <i>ltn1</i>\u25b3 strain expressing no Flag-tagged stalling reporters, from a <i>ltn1</i>\u25b3 strain expressing the K0 parental reporter, or from <i>rqc2</i>\u25b3 or <i>ltn1</i>\u25b3 <i>rqc2</i>\u25b3 strains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Thus, the Sis1 co-IP depended on stalling and on Rqc2, suggesting it binds stalled NCs <i>via</i> the CAT tails and/or aggregates."

The specificity of this phenomenon is underscored by the failure to observe similar slow migrating species for Ssa1 or Ydj1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Like stalled NC aggregates, those Sis1 species were unaffected by treatment with Usp2cc (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover, slow-migrating Sis1 species could be pulled down along with an IP\u2019ed stalling reporter (K12 Flag IP; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), and their formation was dependent on Rqc2\u2019s ability to synthesize CAT tails (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Together, these results suggest that Sis1 tightly associates with stalled NC aggregates. Importantly, given that the formation of these Sis1 species was independent of ectopic expression of stalling reporters, these findings also provide evidence for aggregate formation by endogenous stalled NCs, and suggest that stalling reporter aggregation is not an artifact caused by their overexpression."

Wild type cells transformed with stop codon-containing controls or Rz-dependent stalling constructs were analyzed for PtnA expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Regardless of whether or not they contained lysines, PtnA-STOP-Rz reporters exhibited a similar expression pattern, consisting of a major band of the expected size of the PtnA ZZ domain (lanes 1 and 3). As observed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, the PtnA-NS-Rz construct additionally encoded a protein corresponding in size to the product of full-length, uncleaved PtnA-(Rz)-GFP (lane 2). In contrast, in wild type cells expressing the PtnA-NS-Rz K-less construct, a band corresponding to the PtnA ZZ domain was not evident; instead, smears corresponding to its CATylated and aggregated forms were conspicuous (lane 4; compare to lane 2). We interpret this result as indicating that stalled NC encoded by the truncated PtnA-NS-Rz mRNA are normally targeted for degradation (compare lanes 1 and 2), but targeted for CATylation and aggregation if lysine ubiquitylation sites are not readily available. Furthermore, we conclude that Rqc2-dependent CATylation and aggregation of stalled NCs can both be observed in wild type cells with a functional RQC complex."

In the context of the RQC complex, while Ltn1 mediates stalled NC ubiquitylation, Rqc2 mediates their CATylation (in addition to playing a non-essential role in supporting Ltn1 function). Rqc2 residues implicated in CAT tail synthesis are conserved in evolution, suggesting an important function, but the fate of CAT tail-modified proteins had remained unknown. CATylation was not essential for Ltn1-mediated NC degradation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Rather, here we report that CATylation promoted formation of NC aggregates\u2014yet another process operating in stalled NC quality control. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that proteins can become specifically marked for aggregation."

With regard to the latter, accumulating evidence suggests that Sis1 may function as an amyloid-recognition factor that enables Ssa- and Hsp104-mediated disassembly or random fragmentation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Harris et al., 2014</a>). This proposed function provides a plausible explanation for our observation that Sis1 depletion led to increased NC aggregate levels, although it remains unclear whether and how regulation of presumably antagonistic Rqc2 and Sis1 activities controls steady-state levels of NC aggregates."

Furthermore, NC aggregate formation correlates with the CATylation-dependent activation of Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1) signaling observed in Ltn1-deficient cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Shen et al., 2015</a>). As protein aggregation has been previously shown to elicit Hsf1 activation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Zou et al., 1998</a>), another conceivable role for NC aggregation is therefore in inducing translational stress signaling. On the other hand, excessive aggregate production certainly has the potential to cause toxicity. With these possibilities in mind, it will be important for future studies to investigate the role of NC aggregation in the neurodegenerative phenotype of Listerin-mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chu et al., 2009</a>)."

While the former finding was reported by Shen et al. (Science 347, 2015), the aggregation feature reported by this study is interesting and significant. In particular, it might shed light on the neurodegenerative phenotypes of mice lacking Ltn1. The enthusiasm about the aggregation feature of RQC is reduced a bit by some incomplete results interpretation. The role of chaperone Sis1 in this process, although interesting, remains obscure. With more supporting evidence from additional experiments, I would support publication of this exciting story in <i>eLife</i>."

Given that <i>SIS1</i> is an essential gene in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, in order to address the issue we have had to generate a Ltn1-deficient strain with <i>SIS1</i> expression under the control of a regulatable promoter (Tet-repressible, in our case). We show, using both biochemical and imaging data, that the <i>ltn1</i>\u2206 <i>tetO7</i>-Sis1 strain formed nascent chain aggregates under normal growth conditions, but that aggregate steady-state levels were greatly increased upon repression of Sis1 expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3D and 3E</a>). This finding is consistent with mounting evidence indicating that Sis1 enables the Hsp70 Ssa and Hsp104 to fragment or disassemble amyloid aggregates."

One possibility is that in aggregate levels in the extracts were very low relative to monomeric protein, but that the antibodies used recognize the epitope better in the aggregate form (e.g., due either to avidity or to \u201cmasking\u201d proteins being less abundant in the higher molecular weight range). Another possibility is that poly-Lys addition leads to fragmentation of aggregates; the signal from those fragments would be spread over a wide range of molecular weights in the gel lane, thus making detection difficult. Finally, it is possible that aggregates precipitated with the addition of poly-Lys, although we do not think this is likely because we were attentive to vortex and load the entire sample into the gels."
