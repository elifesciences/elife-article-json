This level of understanding has allowed their manipulation in unprecedented detail. They do not seem a likely source of surprises, yet we describe here the unexpected formation of a new type of fiber by the simple insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short \u03b2-strands, which move the path of the chain by 120\u00b0 around the trimer axis. The result is an \u03b1/\u03b2 coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. Our results show that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold."

This level of understanding has allowed their manipulation in unprecedented detail. They do not seem a likely source of surprises, yet we describe here the unexpected formation of a new type of fiber by the simple insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short \u03b2-strands, which move the path of the chain by 120\u00b0 around the trimer axis. The result is an \u03b1/\u03b2 coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. Our results show that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold."

They consist of at least two \u03b1-helices, wound into superhelical bundles and held together by a mostly hydrophobic core. In their most prevalent form they follow a heptad sequence repeat pattern. The seven positions in a heptad are labeled <i>a \u2013 g</i>, where positions <i>a</i> and <i>d</i> are oriented towards the core of the bundle and are thus mostly hydrophobic. Beyond the heptad repeat, a range of other periodicities is accessible to coiled coils, which is only restrained by the periodicity of the unperturbed \u03b1-helix (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gruber and Lupas, 2003</a>). This restraint is responsible for the supercoiling of the bundle: As an ideal, straight \u03b1-helix has a periodicity of about 3.63 residues per turn, the heptad coiled coil has a left-handed twist to reduce the periodicity to 3.5 residues per turn with respect to the bundle axis. In hendecad coiled coils, the situation is reversed: 11 residues are accommodated in 3 helical turns, resulting in 11/3 = 3.67 residues per turn. As this is slightly above 3.63, hendecads are slightly right-handed. With the periodicity of pentadecad coiled coils, 15/4 = 3.75 residues per turn, right-handedness is as pronounced as left-handedness is in heptad coiled coils."

The best understood discontinuities are insertions of 3 or 4 residues, which are close to the periodicity of 3.63 of \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hicks et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lupas and Gruber, 2005</a>). The insertion of 3 residues is termed a stammer, the insertion of 4 residues a stutter. With 3 residues being less than one full turn of a helix, stammers lead to a local decrease in periodicity and an increase of left-handedness. Stutters have the opposite effect. Inserted into a heptad coiled coil, a stutter can locally extend one heptad to form a hendecad (7 + 4 = 11 -&gt; 11/3) or, being delocalized over multiple heptads, lead to even higher periodicities like 18 residues over 5 turns (7 + 7 + 4 = 18 -&gt; 18/5). Other periodicities can be brought about by the insertion of multiple stammers or stutters (e.g. 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 -&gt; 15/4).

It is centered around the periodicity of unperturbed \u03b1-helices, about 3.63 residues per turn. Higher values than 3.63 lead to right-handed and lower values to left-handed supercoiling. The effects of consecutive insertions of stammers (3 residues) or stutters (4 residues) into a heptad pattern are shown by blue and green lines, respectively. The red lines correspond to the insertion of 1 to 6 residues into the heptad periodicity and their progressive delocalization over neighboring heptads. For example, an insertion of 4 residues is accommodated as 11 residues over 3 turns (11/3), when delocalized over one heptad, or as 18/5, when delocalized over two. Insertions of 1 or 5 residues have to be delocalized over two heptads, resulting in periodicities of 15/4 or 19/5 (which could also be brought about by consecutive stutters \u2013 following the green line from 7/2 over 11/3 over 15/4 to 19/5). Insertions of 3 can be accommodated as 10/3, at the very edge of the green area, although in the known examples the \u03b1-helices are distorted due to the strong left-handed supercoiling which could be avoided by further delocalization. For insertions of 2 or 6 residues (dashed lines) a strong delocalization would be required to reach the green lawn of accessible periodicities. However, for all constructs in this paper, this is not observed. Via the formation of <i>\u03b2</i>-layers these insertions sustain the heptad periodicity as unperturbed as possible."

The insertion of a stammer into a heptad coiled coil, leading locally to a periodicity of 10/3 = 3.33, was predicted to cause an overwinding of the helices (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 1996</a>). We could verify this experimentally: the structure of a stammer showed that the local overwinding introduced sufficient strain to cause the formation of a short 3<sub>10</sub>-helical segment (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hartmann et al., 2009</a>). We therefore assume that 3.33 (10/3) residues per turn mark the lower limit for periodicities. As this is about 0.3 residues per turn less than the periodicity of a perfectly straight helix, one might expect the upper limit at a periodicity of about 3.9. In fact the vast majority of known coiled-coil structures deviating from the heptad repeat have periodicities higher than 3.5 and the most extreme example is found in the trimeric autotransporter YadA, which has a local periodicity of 3.8 (19/5) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez et al., 2010</a>)."

To retain \u03b1-helical structure, both insertions of 1 and 5 residues have to be delocalized over at least two heptads, leading to periodicities of 3.75 (15/4) and 3.8 (19/5), respectively. Interestingly, these periodicities can also be brought about by the insertion of 2 (15/4) and 3 (19/5) consecutive stutters. Alternatively, insertions of 1 residue (skip residues) can be accommodated by the local formation of a \u03c0-turn in the \u03b1-helix, leaving the remaining coiled coil largely unperturbed (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lupas, 1996</a>)."

In the process, we have repeatedly gained insights into aspects of coiled-coil structure (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Grin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hartmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Leo et al., 2011</a>), such as for example into a recurrent polar motif of the hydrophobic core (the N@<i>d</i> layer), in which asparagines in position <i>d</i> of the core coordinate anions at their center (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hartmann et al., 2009</a>). As part of that study, we identified a putative TAA in <i>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</i>, OMP100, which carries insertions of 2 and of 3 residues within the heptad repeats of its stalk. The insertion of 2 residues extends a heptad to the 9-residue motif IENKADKAD and occurs between three N-terminal and two C-terminal heptads carrying N@<i>d</i> layers; the insertion of 3 residues is directly downstream. This observation was highly puzzling, since the heptad register of the protein could be assigned with great confidence, leaving no doubt that an insertion of 2 residues had occurred, but this insertion could not be explained by coiled-coil theory. For structural characterization, we therefore expressed residues 133Q-198K, covering the two insertions and the five N@<i>d</i> layers, fused N- and C-terminally to the trimeric form of the GCN4 leucine zipper, GCN4-pII (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The construct yielded a typical \u03b1-helical CD spectrum and, upon heating, unfolded cooperatively with a transition midpoint at 91\u00b0C. We obtained crystals in space group C2 that diffracted to a resolution of 2.3\u2009\u00c5, with one symmetric trimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure showed a continuous heptad coiled coil with two discontinuities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). As expected, the insertion of 3 residues C-terminal to the N@<i>d</i> layers led to the formation of a decad, with a short 3<sub>10</sub>-helical segment, as for the stammer we had described previously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hartmann et al., 2009</a>)."

Therefore the <i>\u03b2</i>-layer, formed by the three central residues KAD, occurs in place of position <i>d</i>. The two segments are stabilized in their relative orientation by backbone hydrogen bonds from the last (<i>c</i> position) residue of each N-terminal helix to the first (<i>e</i> position) residue in the C-terminal helix of the neighboring chain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

In all examples to date, the resulting overwinding of the helices is absorbed by a short 3<sub>10</sub>-helical segment. While these stammers can be best described to be part of a decad, the <i>\u03b2</i>-layer in OMP100 occurs in a motif of nine residues, a nonad. As the requirements of a nonad on its helices would be even more extreme than those of a decad, the strategy for its accommodation is a local but complete departure from helical structure."

Furthermore we wondered whether insertions of 6 residues, which pose similar demands on the coiled coil (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), also lead to the formation of <i>\u03b2</i>-layers. To tackle these questions experimentally, we designed a set of constructs that had either 6 or 9 residues inserted between two consecutive GCN4 N16V adaptors, based on two different sequence motifs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). One motif is IENKADKAD from <i>Actinobacillus</i> OMP100. The other, MATKDDIAN, is from a second family of prokaryotic coiled-coil proteins that we found to contain nonads and related periodicities; it occurs for example in 14 consecutive repeats in the protein Tcar0761 of <i>Thermosinus carboxydivorans</i>. From <i>Actinobacillus</i> OMP100 we derived the constructs A9 with the full IENKADKAD motif and A6 with the shortened motif IENKAD, as well as the \u2018control\u2019 construct A7 with the 7-residue motif IENKKAD. From <i>Thermosinus</i> Tcar0761 we derived the constructs T9, with the full MATKDDIAN motif, and T6, with the shortened motif MATKDD. The GCN4 N16V variant can form both dimeric and trimeric coiled coils and was chosen for these constructs to test for the oligomerization specificity of the inserts. All five constructs were resistant to proteolysis by proteinase K, showed typical \u03b1-helical CD spectra, did not melt upon heating to 95\u00b0C and yielded well-diffracting crystals. The structures of all constructs were trimeric and could be solved by molecular replacement, using the trimeric GCN4 structure as a search model. For T9, two structures were solved in alternative conformations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Apart from A7, which carries a heptad insert, all structures formed <i>\u03b2</i>-layers. These are identical in their structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), although they are not accommodated in the same way."

The last three residues of the insert assume geometrically clear <i>e, f</i> and <i>g</i> positions and the C-terminal GCN4 adaptor follows in its native register, starting with an <i>a</i> position. Therefore, the <i>\u03b2</i>-layer occurs again in place of position <i>d</i>. A conflict with the native register of the N-terminal adaptor is avoided with just a small \u2018twist\u2019 to the adaptor\u2019s last residue: The C-terminal leucine, natively occurring in position <i>g</i>, is rotated outward from the core of the bundle by about 15\u00b0 so that its Crick angle is biased towards the angle of a <i>c</i> position. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> this is noted as a <i>g/c</i> position, as it is close enough to an ideal position <i>g</i> for the preceding coiled coil to stay in register and close enough to a position <i>c</i> for the formation of the subsequent <i>\u03b2</i>-layer (highlighted in pink in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Surprisingly, the alternative T9 structure, T9<sub>6</sub>, starts out in the same way, forming the <i>\u03b2</i>-layer with the first three residues of the insert, MAT, after a <i>g/c</i> position. Consequently, the middle three residues constitute positions <i>e, f</i> and <i>g</i>. It thereby shows the same 6-residue element as the structure T6. The last three residues of the insert are accommodated as a sharply localized stammer, before the C-terminal adaptor starts in position <i>a</i> (highlighted in pink in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and D</a>). Thus, the two structures T6 and T9<sub>6</sub> show that 6-residue elements are accommodated as N-terminally shortened 9-residue elements.

We had previously found that <i>\u03b2</i>-layers which occur as connectors between TAA domains prefer small, hydrophobic residues in their central position (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hartmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bassler et al., 2015</a>). We therefore thought that the central aspartate of the T9 insert might have been sufficiently unfavorable (T9<sub>9</sub>) that an alternative, with the alanine of MAT at the center of the <i>\u03b2</i>-layer (T9<sub>6</sub>), became observable, even though T9<sub>9</sub> allows the flanking coiled-coil segments to remain unperturbed and T9<sub>6</sub> requires their distortion. We reasoned that the larger glutamate residue at the center of A9b might even be sufficiently unfavorable to move this construct quantitatively to the alternative structure, with the <i>\u03b2</i>-layer formed over the first three residues (IAN). A9b in fact crystallized in two alternative structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), but in both the <i>\u03b2</i>-layer formed over the central glutamate. Since this residue was indeed too large and polar to be accommodated without distortion, the first turns of the downstream helices are perturbed to different extents in both instances, leading to a pronounced kink in one of the structures (highlighted in pink in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We were surprised to see that the penalty introduced by the central glutamate was not sufficient to produce the alternative structure; the reasons for this are unclear to us at present."

The 14 consecutive, almost perfect MATKDDIAN repeats in this protein are flanked by long heptad segments. In our construct we omitted the middle ten nonad\u00a0repeats and trimmed the N- and C terminal heptad segments for in-register fusion to GCN4-N16V (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; red sequence in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Crystallization trials yielded crystals in space group P6<sub>3</sub>, diffracting to a resolution of 1.6\u00c5, with one chain in the asymmetric unit and the trimer built by crystallographic symmetry around the c axis. The structure could be solved by molecular replacement using fragments of the T6 and A9 structures. It shows the anticipated \u03b1/\u03b2 coiled coil with four consecutive <i>\u03b2</i>-layers. These layers are formed by the residues MAT of the repeats; the other residues, corresponding to KDDIAN, constitute positions <i>e,f,g,a,b,c</i> of the segments between the <i>\u03b2</i>-layers. Therefore, in accordance with heptad notation, the repeats can be written as IANMATKDD, with the isoleucine forming classical hydrophobic <i>a</i> layers and the MAT forming <i>\u03b2</i>-layers in place of position <i>d</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

We think that it should be possible to reduce this structure by removing three \u03b1-helical residues and thus the single remaining backbone hydrogen bond from the parent structure. Such a minimalistic \u03b1/\u03b2 coiled coil would be built of hexads, with three residues in the \u03b2 and three in the \u03b1 region of the Ramachandran plot. We have not so far detected coiled-coil proteins with <i>\u03b2</i>-layers in hexad spacing, nor have we been successful in constructing such a structure by fusion of MATKDD repeats between GCN4-N16V adaptors.

The bacterial representatives, where they had the coiled-coil stalk, lacked nonads or related periodicities (in Pfam however, all the coiled-coil segments of this family are grouped together in entry DUF3782). Surprisingly, we found that some bacteria contain coiled-coil proteins that lack the endonuclease domain, but are very similar to the coiled coils of the crenarchaeal proteins; <i>Thermosinus</i> Tcar0761 belongs to these. The <i>\u03b2</i>-layers in this family have the consensus sequence [aliphatic]\u2013A\u2013T\u2013K\u2013[polar]\u2013[DE] (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Pattern searches with this motif led us to the discovery of a family of integral membrane proteins found in prokaryotes and mitochondria (DUF1640), which carry this motif prominently at the beginning of their C-terminal stalk (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, our sequence searches, both based on sequence patterns and on the discovery of relevant insertions into the heptads of coiled coils, have progressed slowly, as they require much case-by-case analysis. This is due on the one hand to the frequency of the <i>\u03b2</i>-layer sequence patterns in coiled coils and on the other to the difficulty of establishing reliably the local register of coiled coils that deviate from the heptad repeat with existing software. Indeed, as we have described for TAAs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Szczesny and Lupas, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bassler et al., 2015</a>), many of these escape detection entirely with current programs."

The results are collected in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. All proteins we identified are homotrimers, except for the SLH domain, which is a monomer with pseudo-threefold symmetry; a majority are from viruses, mainly bacteriophage. Most <i>\u03b2</i>-layers occur in the context of coiled coils and we have termed these \u2018canonical\u2019. They are usually found capping one of the ends of the coiled coil, more often the N-terminal than the C-terminal one, and we have found only two further examples of coiled coils with internal <i>\u03b2</i>-layers: MPN010, a protein of unknown function from <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> (2BA2), and the aforementioned tail-fiber protein with hyaluronidase activity from the <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> prophage SF370.1 (2C3F).

Remarkably, this second <i>\u03b2</i>-layer deviates from canonical <i>\u03b2</i>-layer structure, which we attribute to the serine in the first core position of the downstream coiled coil. This serine spans a water network in the core of the trimer, which invades the \u03b2-interactions of the <i>\u03b2</i>-layer with bridging waters, leading to a largely increased diameter of the layer. This wider diameter might be further promoted by the bulky tyrosine side chain of the central <i>\u03b2</i>-layer residue, which is bent out of the core. Nevertheless, such tandems with the consensus sequence Lxx<b>KAD</b>Kxx<b>VYT</b>KxE occur in many bacterial ORFs (also in some TAAs, such as <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> NadA4) and thus probably constitute a co-optimized module."

They can follow upon either position <i>a</i> or <i>d</i> of the preceding coiled coil, but always lead into positions <i>e, f, g</i> of the following coiled coil. Thus, when they follow upon position <i>a</i> they yield the register <i>a-b-c-\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-\u03b2<sub>2</sub>-\u03b2<sub>3</sub>-e-f-g</i> (seen in nonads), whereas when they follow upon position <i>d</i> they bias the residue in position <i>g</i> towards <i>c</i> to yield the register <i>e-f-g/c-\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-\u03b2<sub>2</sub>-\u03b2<sub>3</sub>-e-f-g</i> (seen in hexads).

Since <i>\u03b2</i>-layers can form interaction networks that provide a C-cap to the preceding coiled coil (see below), it is surprising that they do not do so in most structures where they occur at the C-terminal end of coiled coils."

In return, the sidechain of the residue in position <i>g</i> forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of the <i>\u03b2<sub>3\u00a0</sub></i>residue, closing a ring of sidechain-backbone interactions between these two residues; it is thus almost always D, E, or Q. Where it is D or E, it can further form a salt bridge to the residue in position <i>e</i> of the neighboring chain (clockwise as viewed from the N-terminus), which is broadly conserved as K or R. This residue essentially always forms either this salt bridge, or a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl group of the <i>\u03b2<sub>1\u00a0</sub></i>residue, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. This interaction network allows <i>\u03b2</i>-layers to form stably at the N-terminal end of coiled-coil proteins, as seen in the crystal structures of SadB, MPN010, and the fusion-pH structure of influenza hemagglutinin HA<sub>2</sub>."

Only occasionally, the K or R in position <i>e</i> shows yet a third conformation, coordinating the backbone carbonyl of the <i>\u03b1<sub>2</sub></i> residue of the preceding helix in the neighboring chain (counterclockwise), thus providing a C-capping interaction. However, when the <i>\u03b2<sub>1</sub></i> residue is K (mainly in the stalks of TAAs and related phage proteins) the interaction network changes entirely from an N-cap of the following helices to a C-cap of the preceding ones. The K in <i>\u03b2<sub>1\u00a0</sub></i>reaches across the core of the trimer to form one, two, or all three of the following interactions: coordinate the backbone carbonyls of the <i>\u03b1<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>\u03b2<sub>1\u00a0</sub></i>residues, and the sidechain of the <i>\u03b2<sub>3</sub></i> residue, all from the neighboring chain (clockwise). Additionally, the K or R in position <i>e</i> is entirely found in the C-capping conformation. In all cases, the network is completed by backbone hydrogen bonds from the <i>\u03b1<sub>3</sub></i>residues to the residues in <i>e</i> (clockwise), as already described for OMP100 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These considerations suggest that in a tandem of <i>\u03b2</i>-layers with hexad spacing, the first layer should favor a C-capping network, with K in position <i>\u03b2<sub>1</sub></i>, and the second an N-capping network, with a hydrophobic residue in <i>\u03b2<sub>1</sub></i>.

Insertions of 3 residues into a heptad background (stammers, 10/3 = 3.33) lead to the largest strain observed so far in continuous coiled coils and are accommodated by the local distortion of the \u03b1-helix into a 3<sub>10</sub> helix. We find that increasing the strain further by insertions of 2x3 or 3x3 residues leads to a complete loss of helical structure and the local formation of short \u03b2-strands. These cross to form a triangular plane, which moves the path of each chain by 120\u00b0 counterclockwise around the trimer axis. Within this plane, the central residues of the three \u03b2-strands form backbone hydrogen bonds whose geometry deviates substantially from that seen in \u03b2-sheets. We have named them <i>\u03b2</i>-layers and show that they can be brought about in a straightforward way by the insertion of 6 or 2 (9 = 2 modulo 7) residues into a heptad background. We propose that <i>\u03b2</i>-layers offer two clear advantages to protein fibers. They increase their resilience by tightly interleaving the monomers within the fiber and they offer a simple mechanism to integrate \u03b2-stranded domains into these fibers, thus increasing their functional complexity. Our results show that a novel backbone structure is accessible to the 20 proteinogenic amino acids in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with only minor mutations to a known fold."

Crystallization and cryo-protection conditions for all crystal structures are listed in <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>. All crystals were loop mounted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and all data collected at the SLS (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) under cryo conditions at 100\u2009K using the beamlines and detectors indicated in <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>. Data were processed and scaled using XDS (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kabsch, 1993</a>). Structures were solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vagin and Teplyakov, 2000</a>). For OMP100 and the GCN4-fusion constructs, trimmed models of the SadAK3 structure (2WPQ) were used as search models. For Tcar0761, fragments of the T6 and A9 structures were used. After rebuilding with ARP/WARP (<a href=\"#bib38\">Perrakis et al., 1999</a>), all structures were completed in cyclic manual modeling with Coot (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>) and refinement with REFMAC5 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Murshudov et al., 1999</a>). Analysis with Procheck (<a href=\"#bib30\">Laskowski et al., 1993</a>) showed excellent geometries for all structures. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>. Periodicity plots were calculated based on the output of TWISTER (<a href=\"#bib40\">Strelkov and Burkhard, 2002</a>).

The study builds on a previous finding of a so-called \u03b2-layer structure found in <i>Salmonella enterica</i> autotransporter adhesin SadA from the same group several years ago (Hartmann et al., PNAS, 2012). Via working with a series of natively occurring bacterial adhesion fragments or designed derivatives, the authors showed that formation of the \u03b2-layer structure is a common strategy for the proteins to \"solve\" energetic challenges imposed by the insertion. The work uncovers a new coiled-coil assembly mode and offers a mechanistic understanding for such assembly. The work will be of great interest to scientists working on coiled coil design as it provides a route to expanding the repertoire of accessible structures. The described \u03b1/\u03b2 coiled coils may also serve as templates for designing various protein assemblies."

In all of the constructs described in the study, the two ends of the proteins are \"protected\" by highly stable GCN4 coiled coils. In addition, the authors found that in certain designed sequences (e.g. the A9 construct), the residues form the \u03b2-layer structure are different in different crystals. This naturally leads to the issue of which amino acid residues can or cannot form the \u03b2-layer structure. It will be very useful to have some biochemical information on this aspect. Such information would also be needed to support the authors' claim the formation of the \u03b2-layer can \"increase their resilience\" for coiled coil protein fibers."

In all of the constructs described in the study, the two ends of the proteins are \"protected\" by highly stable GCN4 coiled coils. In addition, the authors found that in certain designed sequences (e.g. the A9 construct), the residues form the \u03b2-layer structure are different in different crystals. This naturally leads to the issue of which amino acid residues can or cannot form the \u03b2-layer structure. It will be very useful to have some biochemical information on this aspect. Such information would also be needed to support the authors' claim the formation of the \u03b2-layer can \"increase their resilience\" for coiled coil protein fibers.</i> "

This view is supported by the high incidence of \u03b2-layers in trimeric adhesins and phage envelope proteins, which we note in a new <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; both are surface proteins optimized to withstand a wide range of environmental conditions. We think that resilience is a corollary of the intertwining of the chains that results from \u03b2-layers, keeping the chains together even after partial denaturation and allowing for a more efficient recovery of the native structure."
