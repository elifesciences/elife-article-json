If public money pays for research into the workings of cells, the causes of diseases or the possibility of life on other planets, then the public should be able to read the research papers that emerge from these projects. And increasingly they can, courtesy of the growth of open-access journals and, more recently, the rise of preprints. There has also been progress in other aspects of open science, such as open data and open-source software\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">McKiernan et al., 2016</a>). However, there is still a long way to go before paywalls disappear and all research papers are made freely available at the time of publication."

It is not enough to give everyone access to every research paper and leave it at that: we have to make research open in other ways. We have to make an effort to communicate with readers outside the research community; we have to speak to pupils and teachers, to healthcare professionals and patients (and their families), to anyone and everyone who is interested in science and research. And we have to speak to them in their language, in the language of the news media and Wikipedia. We have to speak to them in plain language, not in the formal and formulaic prose found in most research papers; and we have to use verbs, not nouns, and to avoid words like characterization and facilitation that \u2013 while much loved and used by scientists \u2013 can stop a sentence or article dead in its tracks."

Here, and in three related articles, we focus on a niche area within this rich tapestry \u2013 the plain-language summary of a research proposal or paper."

These summaries are typically between about 250 and 400 words long and appear immediately below the abstract (and at the top of the second page in the PDF version). The aim of the digest is threefold \u2013 to describe the background to the paper, to summarize the main findings, and to briefly discuss what might happen next \u2013 in language that an interested or motivated reader can understand. While eLife digests are primarily intended for readers outside the research community, a\u00a0<a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/elife-news/plain-language-summaries-elife-survey\">recent survey</a> suggested that they are widely read by other researchers. And plain-language summaries can also be useful to authors when, for example, they need to explain their work in non-technical terms when applying for a fellowship or faculty position."

It was difficult to write digests for some papers, especially if the action never left the cell, but we found a way. However, the continuous growth in the number of papers accepted for publication meant that in 2016 we had to, reluctantly, start publishing papers without digests."

Last year, for example, Jonathan Fullwood of the Bank of England compared the readability of written outputs from five different sources: he found that reports and speeches from his employer and other banks were the least readable, and that political speeches were the most readable. The reason, he wrote, is that \"those writing in the financial industry tend to use long words. They put those words in long sentences. And those sentences in long paragraphs\" (<a href=\"#bib1\">Fullwood, 2016</a>). It is hard to disagree, even if this article does contain one sentence that runs to 87 words."
