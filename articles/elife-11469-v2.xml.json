Here, we report comprehensive ChIP-Seq, transgenic and reporter gene experimental data that have allowed us to construct an experimentally validated regulatory network model for haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Model simulation coupled with subsequent experimental validation using single cell expression profiling revealed potential mechanisms for cell state stabilisation, and also how a leukaemogenic TF fusion protein perturbs key HSPC regulators. The approach presented here should help to improve our understanding of both normal physiological and disease processes."

Here, we report comprehensive ChIP-Seq, transgenic and reporter gene experimental data that have allowed us to construct an experimentally validated regulatory network model for haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Model simulation coupled with subsequent experimental validation using single cell expression profiling revealed potential mechanisms for cell state stabilisation, and also how a leukaemogenic TF fusion protein perturbs key HSPC regulators. The approach presented here should help to improve our understanding of both normal physiological and disease processes."

Firstly, nine transcription factors, which were already known to be important in blood stem cells, were thoroughly studied in mouse cells that could be grown in the laboratory. These experiments provided an overall view of which other genes these transcription factors control. Additional targeted investigations of the nine transcription factors then revealed how these proteins act in combination to activate or repress their respective activities. With this information, Sch\u00fctte et al. built a computational model, which accurately reproduced how real mouse blood stem and progenitor cells behave when, for example, a transcription factor is deleted. Furthermore, the model could also predict what happens in single cells if the amounts of the transcription factors change."

The binding of transcription factor proteins (TFs) to specific DNA sequence motifs represents the primary step of decoding genetic information into specific gene expression patterns. TF binding sites (TFBSs) or motifs are usually short (6\u201310 bp), and therefore found just by chance throughout the genome. Functional TFBSs often occur as evolutionarily conserved clusters, which in the case of enhancers can act over long distances, thus necessitating comprehensive analysis of entire gene loci to understand the transcriptional control mechanisms acting at mammalian gene loci."

Importantly, regulatory network models can provide much more than a representation of existing knowledge, because network simulations can reveal possible molecular mechanisms that underlie highly complex biological processes. Boolean modelling approaches have been used to reconstruct core regulatory networks in blood stem cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonzanni et al., 2013</a>) and myeloid progenitors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krumsiek et al., 2011</a>), but neither of these studies took into account the underlying regulatory structure of the relevant gene regulatory elements. Full gene-regulatory information has been used for an ordinary differential equation-based model (<a href=\"#bib31\">Narula et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Narula et al., 2013</a>), but was restricted to a small three-gene core circuit. Large consortia efforts such as ImmGen and FANTOM5 have created comprehensive networks of either regulatory elements or gene signatures important for multipotency and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gazit et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jojic et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, studies looking at gene regulation circuitry in embryonic stem (ES) cells have proposed regulatory networks important for ES cell identity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dunn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>). While the complexities of transcriptional control demand approaches such as network modelling, no single experimental method can provide the complex biological data required for the construction of accurate models. The previously mentioned studies focus their attention on one specific aspect of network modelling and importantly did not combine network analysis with comprehensive functional validation. Given that the key building blocks are gene regulatory sequences and the TFs bound to them, essential information for network reconstruction includes (i) comprehensive TF binding data, (ii) in vivo validation of the functionality of TF-bound regions as bonafide regulatory elements, and (iii) molecular data on the functional consequences of specific TF-binding events (e.g. activation vs. repression). The regulatory network model that we present in this study comprises all of the aforementioned components and is accompanied by functional validation of model predictions."

First, we searched the literature to summarise known <i>cis-</i>regulatory regions for the nine TFs that possess haematopoietic activity in transgenic mouse embryos, which recovered a total of 14 regions: <i>Erg</i>+85 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wilson et al., 2009</a>), <i>Fli1</i>-15 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beck et al., 2013</a>), <i>Fli1</i>+12, <i>Gata2</i>-3 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pimanda et al., 2007</a>), <i>Gata2</i>+3 (= <i>Gata2</i>+9.5) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wozniak et al., 2007</a>), <i>Gfi1b</i>+13, <i>Gfi1b</i>+16, <i>Gfi1b</i>+17 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wilson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Moignard et al., 2013</a>), <i>Lyl1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chan et al., 2007</a>), <i>Spi1</i>-14 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wilkinson et al., 2014</a>), <i>Runx1</i>+23 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nottingham et al., 2007</a>), <i>Tal1</i>-4 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gottgens et al., 2004</a>), <i>Tal1</i>+19 (<a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00f6ttgens et al., 2002</a>) and <i>Tal1</i>+40 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gottgens et al., 2010</a>)."

                                "text": "To extend this partial knowledge of relevant gene regulatory sequences to a comprehensive definition of how these nine TFs might cross-regulate each other, we made use of the genome-wide binding data for the nine TFs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wilson et al., 2010</a>) as well as information on acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Calero-Nieto et al., 2014</a>) in the HPC7 blood progenitor cell line. Additional candidate gene regulatory regions for all nine TFs were selected based on the\u00a0binding of at least three TFs and H3K27ac, since it has been shown previously that transcriptionally active regions are commonly bound by multiple TFs and display H3K27 acetylation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hardison and Taylor, 2012</a>). To assign putative candidate regions to a given TF, they had to be located between its respective upstream and downstream flanking genes, i.e. within the gene body itself or its 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 intergenic flanking regions. The <i>Erg</i> gene locus for example contains five candidate <i>cis-</i>regulatory regions based on these criteria, namely <i>Erg</i>+65, <i>Erg</i>+75, <i>Erg</i>+85, <i>Erg</i>+90 and <i>Erg</i>+149 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), of which only the <i>Erg</i>+85 region had previously been tested in transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wilson et al., 2009</a>). Inspection of the gene loci of all nine TFs resulted in the identification of 35 candidate <i>cis-</i>regulatory regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s8\">8</a>). In addition to the 14 haematopoietic enhancers previously published, eight of the 35 new candidate regulatory regions had previously been shown not to possess activity in tissues of the blood system of mouse embryos: <i>Gata2</i>-83 (<i>Gata2</i>-77), <i>Gfi1b</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moignard et al., 2013</a>), <i>Spi1</i>-18, <i>Spi1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wilkinson et al., 2014</a>), <i>Runx1</i> P1 promoter (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bee et al., 2009</a>), <i>Tal1</i>-9, <i>Tal1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sinclair et al., 1999</a>) and <i>Tal1</i>+6 (<a href=\"#bib45\">S\u00e1nchez et al., 1999</a>). Of the remaining 27 candidate <i>cis-</i>regulatory regions, two coincided with genomic repeat regions (<i>Runx1</i>-322 and <i>Runx1</i>+1) and were excluded from further analysis because mapping of ChIP-Seq reads to such regions is ambiguous. Since a comprehensive understanding of regulatory interactions among the nine HSPC TFs requires in vivo validation of candidate regulatory regions, we next tested the remaining 25 candidate <i>cis-</i>regulatory regions for their ability to mediate reporter gene expression in embryonic sites of definitive haematopoietic cell emergence and colonisation, namely the dorsal aorta and foetal liver of E10.5 to E11.5 transgenic <i>LacZ</i>-reporter mouse embryos. For the <i>Erg</i> locus, this analysis revealed that in addition to the previously known <i>Erg</i>+85 enhancer, the <i>Erg</i>+65 and <i>Erg</i>+75 regions also displayed activity in the dorsal aorta and/or the foetal liver, while the <i>Erg</i>+90 and <i>Erg</i>+149 regions did not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Careful inspection of a total of 188 transgenic mouse embryos revealed that nine of the 25 identified regions showed <i>LacZ</i> expression in the dorsal aorta and/or foetal liver (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s8\">8</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). This large-scale transient transgenic screen therefore almost doubled the number of known in vivo validated early haematopoietic regulatory elements for HSPC TFs."

                                "text": "Although HPC7 cells are a useful model cell line for the prediction of genomic regions with haematopoietic activity in transgenic mouse assays (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wilson et al., 2009</a>), they are refractory to most gene transfer methods and therefore not suitable for functional characterisation of regulatory elements using standard transcriptional assays. By contrast, the 416b myeloid progenitor cell line can be readily transduced by electroporation and therefore represents a candidate cell line for functional dissection of individual regulatory elements. As ChIP-Seq profiles in 416b cells had not been reported previously, we performed ChIP-Seq for H3K27ac and the nine TFs in this cell line (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2s8\">8</a>). Alongside with our previously published HPC7 data, this new 416b dataset represents the most complete genome-scale TF-binding analysis in haematopoietic progenitor cell lines to date, with all new data being freely accessible under the following GEO accession number GSE69776 and also at <a href=\"http://codex.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/\">http://codex.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/</a>. Genome-wide TF binding patterns in 416b and HPC7 cells were closely related when compared with binding profiles for the same factors in other haematopoietic lineages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Inspection of the gene loci for the nine HSPC TFs not only revealed many similarities between 416b and HPC7 cells, but also some differences in TF binding patterns. Overall, TF occupancy at the 23 regions with activity in haematopoietic tissues (14 previously published (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wilson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Beck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pimanda et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wozniak et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Moignard et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wilkinson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nottingham et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00f6ttgens et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gottgens et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gottgens et al., 2010</a>) and 9 newly identified) does not change between the two cell types in 71% of all cases (147 of 207 binding events), is gained in 416b cells in 16% (33 of 207) and lost in 13% (27 of 207) of cases compared to HPC7 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Next, all 23 elements were filtered to only retain those elements which were bound by at least 3 of the 9 TFs and displayed elevated H3K27ac in HPC7 and 416 cells. This led to the removal of the <i>Gata2</i>-3, which is not bound by any of the nine TFs in either cell type, <i>Gata2</i>-92 and <i>Gfi1b</i>+13, which are only bound by one or no TFs in 416b cells, and <i>Fli1</i>-15, which is not acetylated in 416b cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2s3\">3</a>). Overall, 19 <i>cis-</i>regulatory regions were therefore taken forward as a comprehensively validated set of regions for the reconstruction of an HSPC regulatory network model."

                                "text": "The reconstruction of a core regulatory network model requires information about the effect of TF binding on gene expression, which can be activating, repressing or non-functional. In order to analyse the effects of all TF-binding events at all 19 regulatory regions, we performed luciferase reporter assays in stably transfected 416b cells. Based on multiple species alignments between five species (mouse, human, dog, platypus, opossum), we identified conserved TFBSs for the nine TFs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s18\">18</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>), and generated mutant constructs for each of the 19 regulatory regions, resulting in 87 reporter constructs that were tested by luciferase assays (19 wild-type, 68 mutants). To ensure that DNA binding of the TFs was abrogated, the key DNA bases involved in DNA-protein interactions were mutated and the resulting sequences were scanned to ensure that no new binding sites were created (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lelieveld et al., 2015</a>). For each of the 19 regulatory regions, the conserved TFBSs were mutated by family, for example, all six Ets sites within the <i>Erg</i>+65 region were mutated simultaneously in one construct, and this element was then treated as the <i>Erg</i>+65_Ets mutant. TFBS mutations reduced or increased activity compared to the wild-type enhancer, or indeed had no significant effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s18\">18</a>). For instance, at the <i>Erg</i>+65 region, mutation of the six Ets binding sites or the three Gata binding sites reduced luciferase activity, whereas mutation of the three Ebox or the three Gfi motifs increased luciferase activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Comparison of the luciferase assay results for all 19 <i>cis-</i>regulatory regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>) reveals that for each motif class mutation can result in activation, repression or no-change. This observation even extends to single gene loci, where for example mutation of the Gata site reduced activity of the <i>Erg</i>+65 region, but increased activity of the <i>Erg</i>+85 enhancer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Taken together, this comprehensive mutagenesis screen highlights the dangers associated with extrapolating TF function simply from ChIP-Seq binding events and thus underlines the importance of functional studies for regulatory network reconstruction."

We focussed on three categories of causal relationships: (i) one or several TFs can bind to a certain type of motif at a given regulatory region, and the probability of a motif being bound depends on the expression levels of the relevant TFs; (ii) TFBS mutations at a given regulatory region altered luciferase activities compared to the wild-type, thus capturing the impact of TF binding on the\u00a0activity of the given regulatory region; (iii) individual regulatory regions show varying degrees of activation over baseline controls, which translate into different relative strengths of individual <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions. To incorporate this multi-layered experimental information, we constructed a three-tier dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to jointly represent all those causal relationships (see Material and Methods and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). The reconstructed DBN represents a first-order time-homogeneous Markov process, which is a stochastic process where the transition functions are the same throughout all time points, and the conditional probability distribution of future states depends only on the present state (see Material and Methods). The model is calculated so that the expression at t+1 is influenced by the expression at t0; analogously, the expression at t0 is influenced by the expression at t-1, and so on. Therefore, though the model does not incorporate 'epigenetic memory', past expression levels directly influence current expression levels. Model execution therefore permits the simulation of gene expression states in single cells over time, as well as the calculation of gene expression distributions for each gene across a population of simulated single cells."

First, we investigated whether the network model was compatible with the HSPC expression profile from which all the experimental data are derived, namely co-expression of all nine TFs. To this end, model execution was initiated with expression levels for all nine TFs set at the midpoint level of 0.5. A representative single cell modelled over time rapidly adopts characteristic levels of expression for each of the nine genes, with some genes showing perpetual fluctuations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). The same expression levels were reached when the model was initiated with expression starting at 0.2, 0.8 or with initially only FLI1, RUNX1 and TAL1 being expressed at 0.5 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next modelled the overall distribution of the nine TFs as might be seen in a cell population by running 1000 model simulations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). This analysis demonstrated that our model is compatible with co-expression of all nine genes within the same single cell. Moreover, stable expression over time for some genes as well as oscillations around a characteristic mean expression level for other genes suggests that our model may have captured those aspects of HSPC regulatory networks that ensure the\u00a0maintenance of stem/progenitor cells."

Combined deletion in adult HSCs however causes a severe phenotype with rapid loss of HSPCs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Souroullas et al., 2009</a>). We wanted to investigate to what extent our computer model could recapitulate these known phenotypes through in silico perturbation simulations. To quantify if a change in the expression profile of a given TF was significant, we performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Interestingly, this significance calculation demonstrated that both large and small fold-changes can be significant. Simulated perturbation of just LYL1 caused significant alterations to the expression profiles of <i>Gfi1b, Tal1, Fli1</i> and <i>Gata2</i>, but none of these were associated with a substantial shift in mean expression levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Perturbation of just TAL1 caused significant changes to the expression profiles of <i>Runx1, Gfi1b</i> and <i>Gata2</i>, and again none of these were associated with a substantial shift in expression levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Simultaneous deletion of both factors caused significant changes in gene expression profiles in all TFs except for <i>Fli1</i>. Unlike for the single TF perturbations, <i>Gata2</i> and <i>Runx1</i> showed substantial shifts in expression levels when both LYL1 and TAL1 were simulated to be knocked down (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of note, the significance calculations highlight that there may be no one perfect way to visualize these small fold-change alterations.

This major disruption of the core GRN for blood stem/progenitor cells is therefore consistent with TAL1/LYL1 double knockout HSCs showing a much more severe phenotype than the respective single knock-outs.

Because our DBN model is particularly suited to model the expression states in single cells, we compared predicted and experimentally observed effects of knockdown or overexpression in single cells. To this end, we knocked down the expression of TAL1 in 416b cells by transfecting the cells with siRNA against <i>Tal1</i> (siTal1) or control siRNA (siCtrl). Forty-eight hours after transfection, gene expression for the nine network genes was analysed in 44 siTal1 treated cells and 41 siCtrl treated cells. Importantly, 29 of 44 cells (66%) transfected with siTal1 showed no expression of <i>Tal1</i> anymore, demonstrating the successful knockdown (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Down-regulation of TAL1 caused a significant change in the expression profiles of <i>Tal1, Fli1</i> and <i>Gfi1b</i>, but a substantial shift of median expression was only observed for <i>Tal1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Experimental validation therefore confirmed the occurrence of statistically significant small-fold changes in expression profiles following single TF knockdown, although there was no perfect match between the genes affected in the model and experiment. To extend comparisons between model predictions and experimental validation, we investigated the consequences of knocking down the expression of PU.1 and overexpressing GFI1B. Complete removal of PU.1 in silico after the model had reached its initial steady state had no effect on the expression levels of the other TFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). To investigate whether the model prediction is comparable to experimental data obtained from single cells, single cell gene expression analysis using the Fluidigm Biomark HD platform was performed using 416b cells transduced with shRNA against PU.1 (shPU.1) or luciferase (shluc). Three days after transduction, 121 shPU.1 and 123 shluc transduced single cells were analysed for their expression of <i>Spi1</i> and the other eight TFs of the network. 18 shPU.1-transduced cells (15%) showed a complete loss of <i>Spi1</i>, and expression of <i>Spi1</i> in the remaining cells was markedly reduced compared to the control cells (shluc) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), highlighting the efficiency of the PU.1 knockdown. <i>Spi1, Runx1, Erg</i> and <i>Fli1</i> showed a significant change in expression profiles after the depletion of PU.1, but this involved a substantial shift in median expression levels only for <i>Spi1</i> and <i>Runx1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Expression profiles of the remaining five TFs did not change as a result of reduced PU.1 levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), therefore mostly confirming the model prediction."

Expression profiles of the other five TFs were unaltered. Single cell gene expression analysis of 90 single 416b cells transduced with a GFI1B-expressing vector and 104 single 416b cells transduced with an empty control vector showed a significant increase in the expression of <i>Gfi1b</i> and a significant alteration to the expression profile of <i>Erg</i>, but only the changes to <i>Gfi1b</i> involved a substantial shift in median expression levels. No significant expression changes were seen in any of the other seven network genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). Both PU.1 and GFI1B perturbation studies therefore emphasize the resilience of the HSPC TF network to single TF perturbation. Moreover, our in silico model reflects this, thus suggesting that the comprehensive experimental information used to construct the network model has allowed us to capture key mechanistic aspects of HSPC regulation. Of note, there were no short-term major expression changes immediately after the perturbation in the in\u00a0silico simulations for the three single TF perturbations described above. For completeness, we performed in silico modelling for all permutations of single TF knockdown / overexpression as well as all pairwise combinations of all 9 TFs analysed (a total of 162 simulations, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>)."

The <i>Aml-Eto9a</i> translocation is amongst the most frequent mutations in AML (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib27\">Licht, 2001</a>]). The resulting fusion protein is thought to act in a dominant-negative manner to repress RUNX1 target genes. To simulate the leukaemic scenario caused by AML-ETO expression, we fixed the level of <i>Runx1</i> to be the maximum value 1 and at the same time converted all activating inputs of RUNX1 to inhibiting inputs in our DBN model. Interestingly, this simulation of a 'leukaemic' perturbation caused significant expression changes to all eight of the core HSPC TFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). To compare the AML-ETO simulation results with experimental data, we utilised a doxycycline-inducible expression system to generate 416b cells with inducible expression of AML1-ETO fused to a mCherry reporter via a self-cleaving 2A peptide spacer. Following doxycycline induction, 56 single mCherry positive and 122 single mCherry negative 416b cells were analysed by single cell gene expression. Significant gene expression changes can be seen in six of the nine core HSPC TFs (all except <i>Tal1, Erg</i> and <i>Gata2</i>) thus highlighting significant overlap between predictions and experimental validation, although there are also notable differences between model predictions and the experimental data (see for example Gata2; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). These results demonstrate that our new HSPC network model can capture many gene expression changes caused by ectopic expression of a leukaemia oncogene as well as providing a useful model for normal HSPC transcriptional regulation. The inability of any model to completely recapitulate experimental data is not unexpected. Possible reasons in our case may include more complex activities of the onco-fusion protein than would be captured by our assumption that its 'only' function is as a straightforward dominant-negative effect, or the fact that the computational model is a closed system of only the 9 network TFs, whereas the experimental single cell perturbation is subject to possible knock-on consequences from gene changes outside of the 9\u00a0TF network."

Since the functionality of such regulatory networks is ultimately encoded in the genome, the logic that governs interactions between network components should be identifiable, and in due course allow for the construction of network models that are capable of capturing the behaviour of complex biological processes. However, the construction of such network models has so far been severely restricted because the identification and subsequent functional characterisation of mammalian regulatory sequences represent major challenges, and the connectivity and interaction rules within regulatory networks can be highly complex. Here, we report a comprehensive mammalian transcriptional network model that is fully grounded in experimental data. Model simulation coupled with subsequent experimental validation using sophisticated single cell transcriptional assays revealed the mechanistic basis for cell state stability within a haematopoietic progenitor model cell line, and also how a leukaemogenic TF fusion protein can perturb the expression of a subset of key blood stem cell regulators."

Although the experimentally-grounded network model shows good agreement with the relative expression states of the nine TFs for the wild-type as well as the perturbation data, model predictions are not correct in all cases. Apart from the obvious caveat that any computer model is an abstraction of reality and therefore will not be correct in every detail, it also needs to be stressed that we treat the nine TFs as an isolated module for the computer simulations, and therefore could not account for possible influences by additional genes that may affect single cell gene expression measurements in the perturbation experiments."

Such alterations to expression profiles were prevalent in both single and double\u00a0gene perturbations, whereas substantial shifts in median expression were mostly restricted to the double perturbations (and also the AML-ETO oncogene overexpression). This observation suggests that (i) our approach has the capacity to reveal the\u00a0aspects of the fine-grained nature of biological networks, and (ii) the network presented in this study is largely resistant to perturbations of individual TFs in terms of substantial fold-change alterations in median expression levels. We believe that it may well be possible that the statistically significant small-fold changes in HSPC network genes may be responsible for the mild phenotypes seen when major HSPC regulators are deleted in adult HSPCs. <i>Tal1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice for example are not viable because TAL1 is absolutely required for embryonic blood development (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shivdasani et al., 1995</a>), yet deletion of TAL1 in adult HSCs only causes minor phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mikkola et al., 2003</a>). Another noteworthy observation is that it would have been impossible to detect the statistically significant yet small fold-changes using conventional expression profiling, because they only become apparent following the statistical analysis of expression distributions generated by assaying lots of single cells. More generally, it is important to acknowledge that the question of how close the present model comes to capturing the underlying biological processes can only be revealed through much more exhaustive experimental validation studies."

We assumed that any of the following three factors can lead to a higher probability of a motif being bound by a TF and therefore taking the value 2: (i) more motifs of the same type present within a regulatory region; (ii) multiple TFs that can bind to the same motif, such as TAL1 and LYL1 both binding to Eboxes; (iii) higher expression levels of the TFs. The probabilities were thus calculated based on these three sources of information (see below for an example). We next defined that every regulatory region was a continuous variable on the close interval [0, 1], and its value was determined by the accumulated effects of all motifs present within the regulatory region. Finally, the expression levels of the nine TFs were also defined as continuous variables ranging from 0 to 0.8, and their expression levels were determined by the accumulated activities of the relevant regulatory regions."

Specifically, the regression coefficient of a regulatory region on a motif family was estimated by normalizing the logarithmic deviation of luciferase activity, where deviation refers to the change of luciferase activity between the wild-type and the mutated (one motif family at a time) regulatory region (see below for a demonstration). Using the logarithmic deviation allowed us to account for the differences in effect sizes of various motif families by rescaling the differences to a comparable range. Similarly, for each of the nine genes, the regression coefficient of its expression level on a relevant regulatory region was estimated by normalizing the logarithmic deviation of luciferase activity, where deviation refers to the change of luciferase activity compared to the empty vector controls.

One may raise the question of whether this number has such strong power. Specifically, should the exponents in <a href=\"#equ1\">equations (1)</a> and <a href=\"#equ2\">(2)</a> change linearly, or less than linearly, along with the increase in the number of Ebox motifs? To address this issue, we replaced all exponents with their square roots and re-run the whole set of simulations (data not shown). Results showed that using the square roots instead of the original numbers (i) caused a more evenly distributed expression of the nine TFs over the hypothetical interval [0, 1], (ii) captured the same trend in gene expression changes in some perturbations (e.g. the AML-ETO simulation), but (iii) led to decreased expression levels of certain TFs in other perturbations (e.g. PU.1 knockdown and GFI1B overexpression), which therefore disagrees with the experimental data. In order to capture a better agreement of computational and experimental results, we directly used the number of motifs to estimate the discrete probability distributions."

The authors identify many new regulatory elements likely to contribute to transcription factor (TF) gene regulation in progenitor cells, and use these to construct a dynamic gene network model. They also test multiple functional effects by knockdown experiments and expression of the oncogenic AML1-ETO dominant negative transcription factor. The manuscript addresses a crucial question \u2013 how much information is sufficient to build mammalian gene regulatory network models that capture real biology and have quantitative predictive power? \u2013, and the criteria used to identify cis-regulatory elements of potential interest, as well as the way the authors model regulatory gene interactions in a sophisticated, dynamic Bayesian model that incorporates cis-regulatory site number, TF levels, and known regions of TF occupancy represent significant, strengths of the work. While individual modeling choices can be debated, the authors' approach will certainly be interesting to many readers. They also are very straightforward about assumptions that go into the model that could be subject to revision in future improvements, such as the need to approximate TF levels by the levels of TF coding RNAs, and the baseline assumptions that binding events are independent and purely driven by TF concentrations. Nonetheless, there are some points that the authors still need to address, as detailed below."

Can it really be assumed that each mutation completely abrogates binding?

The paper would benefit from the inclusion of all other model predictions for the knockdown/overexpression of any single or any combination of two factors. Such simulations should be straightforward to run with the model at hand and might help to substantiate the claims made by the authors about the system being generally resistant to single-TF perturbations. As it stands we are presented with several examples in favor of the authors' claims, but we do not know whether the model might also make contrary predictions for other factors. We wouldn't expect each case to be supported by experimental evidence (after all, that's the point of having model), but if there are any unexpected observations made in the model runs these need to be explained/harmonized with the current hypothesis."

In part one might imagine that the knockdown is incomplete at the protein level, but in general the authors should more strongly rebut a possible objection that the cross-regulation linkages proposed in the network are not really very significant at all. This is a crucial point, because it affects the whole evaluation of the work that has gone into the model. Also, given the weak effects the authors show when they do actual perturbation experiments, it is important to include at least one additional test \u2013 for example knockdown/knockout of <i>Lyl1</i>/scl1. It seems that for some of the phenotypes, the authors may be investing marginal results with too much significance, and they are also not clearly articulating or defending their threshold for what is a significant effect. This would be improved by the addition of one more comparison of the model to experimental data."

As expected from our model analysis, the only TF with a significant shift of median expression was <i>Scl</i> itself.
