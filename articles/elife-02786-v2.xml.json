Although active cell-in-cell invasion depends on RhoA and actin, the precise mechanism as well as the underlying actin structures and assembly factors driving the process are unknown. Furthermore, whether specific cell surface receptors trigger entotic invasion in a signal-dependent fashion has not been investigated. In this study, we identify the G-protein-coupled LPA receptor 2 (LPAR2) as a signal transducer specifically required for the actively invading cell during entosis. We find that G<sub>12/13</sub> and PDZ-RhoGEF are required for entotic invasion, which is driven by blebbing and a uropod-like actin structure at the rear of the invading cell. Finally, we provide evidence for an involvement of the RhoA-regulated formin Dia1 for entosis downstream of LPAR2. Thus, we delineate a signaling process that regulates actin dynamics during cell-in-cell invasion."

Although active cell-in-cell invasion depends on RhoA and actin, the precise mechanism as well as the underlying actin structures and assembly factors driving the process are unknown. Furthermore, whether specific cell surface receptors trigger entotic invasion in a signal-dependent fashion has not been investigated. In this study, we identify the G-protein-coupled LPA receptor 2 (LPAR2) as a signal transducer specifically required for the actively invading cell during entosis. We find that G<sub>12/13</sub> and PDZ-RhoGEF are required for entotic invasion, which is driven by blebbing and a uropod-like actin structure at the rear of the invading cell. Finally, we provide evidence for an involvement of the RhoA-regulated formin Dia1 for entosis downstream of LPAR2. Thus, we delineate a signaling process that regulates actin dynamics during cell-in-cell invasion."

From this, Purvanov et al. established the identities of the proteins involved in transmitting the lysophosphatidic acid signal that controls mDia1 activity during entosis. Changes to this signaling pathway have been associated with cancer and how it spreads between different organs and its involvement in entosis lends further support to the notion that there may be a link between cell-in-cell invasion and the advancement of cancer."

Frequently, this occurs between tumor cells such as breast, cervical, or colon carcinoma cells and can be triggered by matrix detachment (<a href=\"#bib13\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>), suggesting that loss of integrin-mediated adhesion may promote cell-in-cell invasion. This is further supported by the fact that homotypic cell-in-cell structures can be regularly found when tumor cells are released into fluid exudates such as ascites or during pleural carcinosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008</a>). Although the consequence of entotic invasion is not well understood, the process may contribute to tumor progression by inducing aneuploidy in human cancers (<a href=\"#bib10\">Krajcovic et al., 2011</a>). The ultimate outcome of an entotic event also depends on the fate of the invaded cell, which can remain viable or even divide inside or escape from the host cell or undergo vacuolar degradation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Florey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Krajcovic et al., 2011</a>)."

However, potential extracellular ligands or cell surface receptors involved in this migratory process are entirely unknown. Furthermore, what type of actin structures and which actin polymerization factor triggers active cell-in-cell invasion in a signal-regulated fashion remained unclear. In this study, we investigated actin-mediated entotic invasion and delineate a signaling pathway downstream of the LPAR2 that ultimately targets the formin mDia1 for polarized actin assembly at the rear of the invading cell to drive cell-in-cell invasion."

Red and green LifeAct-cell populations were mixed and plated on top of polyHEMA-coated coverslips to prevent matrix adhesion and to induce entotic incidences. Under these conditions, cell-in-cell invasion was confirmed to require ROCK as assessed using the ROCK-inhibitor Y-27632 (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Overholtzer et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, imaging LifeAct-expressing cells over time, we consistently observed that specifically the actively invading cell displayed extensive blebbing early on during invasion followed by the formation of an actin-rich uropod-like structure at the rear of the invading cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Plasma membrane blebbing was highly dynamic under these cell culture conditions with a bleb cycle lasting about 2 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) and the total number of blebs ranged from 60 to 100 blebs per cell depending on the MCF10A cell size. Notably, blebbing is a frequently observed phenomenon during amoeboid or rounded cancer cell invasion through 3-dimensional collagen requiring ROCK-dependent contractility (<a href=\"#bib14\">Sahai and Marshall, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Kitzing et al., 2007</a>). The presence of the polarized actin-rich cup at the rear of the entosing cell could be confirmed using phalloidin staining to visualize endogenous actin filaments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) or by confocal microscopy of LifeAct-expressing MCF10A cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

A ligand known to be present at micromolar concentrations in FCS is lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Thus, we speculated that LPA might trigger entosis. Indeed, under serum-free conditions addition of LPA efficiently stimulated entotic events of MCF10A cells in a concentration-dependent manner already at nanomolar concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This ligand mediated cell-in-cell invasion was dependent on cell surface receptor activity since the LPA-receptor 1, 2 and 3 inhibitor Ki16425 completely blocked LPA-stimulated entosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Comparable results were obtained when entosis was triggered by serum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These data identify the soluble extracellular ligand and serum component LPA as a mediator of cell-in-cell invasion."

We have shown previously that bleb-associated cancer cell invasion through collagen matrices requires the activity of the Diaphanous formin mDia1 downstream of RhoA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kitzing et al., 2007</a>). We therefore hypothesized that the actin nucleation factor mDia1 may also be involved in entotic invasion. Interestingly, we found endogenous mDia1 to be enriched at the cell rear of the invading cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting that mDia1 function spatially controls entosis. Indeed, ectopically expressed mDia1-GFP was localized to the actin-rich cup formed in HEK293 cells upon LPAR2 transfection to trigger entotic invasion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This mDia1 localization is also in good agreement with our data showing that the RhoA activator PDZ-RhoGEF is strongly accumulated at the actin-rich cell rear (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

Importantly, mDia1 knockdown MCF10A cells were strongly impaired to undergo entotic invasion as compared to control siRNA-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Under these conditions, when latrunculin B was added just before completion of entosis, we observed the rapid dispersion of the trailing actin-rich cup leading to failure of cell-in-cell invasion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>), pointing towards a crucial role for polarized actin assembly during final stages of entosis. Suppression of mDia1 by siRNA treatment also strongly and specifically inhibited LPAR2-triggered entosis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>) in HEK293 cells, showing that mDia1 is an essential factor that acts downstream of LPAR2 during cell-in-cell invasion."

It is tempting to speculate that such active invasive and complex process may result in some survival advantage or even represent an escape mechanism for carcinoma cells, although often the inner cell undergoes a cell death process involving components of the autophagy machinery (<a href=\"#bib4\">Florey et al., 2011</a>). In this study, we report on a cell surface receptor pathway that facilitates active invasion to produce a cell-in-cell structure. Interestingly, some of these components such as RhoA and mDia1 have been shown to function during rounded cancer cell invasion, which is similarly accompanied by cell blebbing (<a href=\"#bib15\">Sanz-Moreno and Marshall, 2010</a>), although this processes can still depend on integrin-based matrix adhesions. Our findings suggest that entotic invasion, although independent of integrins, resembles at least in some aspects that of amoeboid and bleb-dependent motility. Indeed, actin filaments also coincide at the Ezrin-rich uropod in amoeboid blebbing thereby pushing cells through collagen-I (<a href=\"#bib11\">Lorentzen et al., 2011</a>) and ezrin is further an essential component for non-apoptotic blebbing (<a href=\"#bib1\">Charras et al., 2006</a>). It seems reasonably that Ezrin is potentially also required for entosis as we observed strong Ezrin localization at the invading cell uropod (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), however, its precise role and regulation in this process remains a future task for investigations. The relevance of entosis for tumor progression in vivo is currently unclear. Nevertheless, our data uncover LPA and LPAR2 as important drivers of entotic invasion, both of which are also important factors during cancer metastasis, suggesting that entosis may be a phenomenon associated with advanced malignancy."

While the phenomenon itself is well-described, and a role for actin and autophagy has been shown to be important for events after engulfment, little is known about the receptor(s) that recognize cells for entosis. They noted that you describe the identification for a receptor and downstream pathway for entosis. You identify a requirement for LPA, and this led them to identify, by siRNA and ectopic expression, the G-protein coupled receptor LPAR2 as the critical receptor. You go on to show that the downstream pathway involves G12/13 family GPCRs, PDZ-RhoGEF and mDia1 that induce actin remodeling in the rear uropod of the engulfing cell."

As mentioned above in point 2, we cannot address the requirement of Rho/mDia1 for uropod formation since inhibition of these factors interferes with blebbing and entotic invasion or intitiation early on before uropod formation during later stages of entosis. Thus, these factos are also required for bleb-associated initiation of entosis as also shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), which illustrates that si-mDia1 (red) treated cells do not invade although they still make contacts to a neighboring cell, which becomes entosed by a control cell (green). Thus it seems that the entire actin-driven processes is under the control of the Rho/mDia1 pathway such as blebbing for initiation and completion of entotic invasion. Along these lines, it can be noted that the actin-rich uropod-like structure is also actively blebbing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A, 4F</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2 and 4</a>). Furthermore, we do find good accumulation of endogenous or mDia1-GFP specifically in the invading cell rear <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>."
