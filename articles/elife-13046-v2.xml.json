By taking many of these images and then subjecting them to computer processing it is possible to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the molecule."

Direct electron detectors already changed the prospects of the cryo-EM field (<a href=\"#bib15\">Henderson, 2015</a>) with atomic resolution structures becoming almost routine (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campbell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartesaghi et al., 2015</a>). Phase plates improve the image contrast and allow in-focus data acquisition which, in theory, will result in increase of the signal-to-noise ratio across the entire frequency spectrum (<a href=\"#bib13\">Glaeser, 2013</a>). This could enable structural investigations of 'difficult' samples, such as small, heterogeneous and/or flexible molecules or complexes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hall et al., 2011</a>). Until now, however, various practical problems and performance issues have prevented the acquisition of high-resolution datasets with a phase plate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Danev et al., 2009</a>). Here we demonstrate that with correct use, in particular accurate focusing, one can achieve near-atomic resolutions."

Phase contrast denotes that phase variations of the electron wave caused by the sample will be transformed into amplitude variations at the camera thus enabling phase observation. Ideally, the phase shift must be \u03c0/2 to realize the so-called Zernike phase contrast (<a href=\"#bib7\">Danev and Nagayama, 2001</a>). In practice, however, a satisfactory phase contrast performance can be obtained within a range of phase shift values (\u03c0/4 ~ 3\u03c0/4) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Danev and Nagayama, 2011</a>). There are other ways to produce phase contrast, the most common is acquiring images slightly out of focus, also known as defocus phase contrast. This method is the de facto standard in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) but it has the disadvantage of low overall contrast because of poor performance at low spatial frequencies, i.e. large specimen features are not well reproduced in the image."

Nevertheless, the Zrnike phase plate has some practical issues, such as a short usable lifespan, produces fringe artifacts in the images, is difficult to use and almost impossible to automate because the central diffraction beam must be positioned precisely in the middle of the small central hole (<a href=\"#bib9\">Danev et al., 2009</a>). There are a few examples in the literature of single particle analysis (SPA) with the Zernike phase plate but in all of them the resolution was limited to about one nanometer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Danev and Nagayama, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Murata et al., 2010</a>)."

The phase shift is created on-the-fly through the interaction of the central diffraction beam with the carbon film (<a href=\"#bib11\">Danev et al., 2014</a>). This mitigates the requirement for precise centering of the phase plate but also gives rise to the only drawback of the VPP \u2013 the phase shift is not constant and increases proportionally to the accumulated dose. The evolving phase shift is not a performance limiting factor but rather a parameter that has to be kept in mind when designing data acquisition strategies. Nevertheless, the ability to create phase shift at any given place on the phase plate film is a notable practical advantage. A wide open area of the film provides multiple virtual phase plates by just moving from one position to the next. The distance between the positions must be large enough (typically ~20\u2009\u03bcm apart) to prevent the previous phase shift spot from interfering with spatial frequencies below the Nyquist frequency of the detector. Having the ability to move arbitrarily on the phase plate and create phase shift opens the VPP to automation. This is an important practical factor in sync with recent trends towards unattended 24/7 data collection. All datasets in this work were collected automatically."

In those trials we used software and data acquisition schemes developed for conventional defocus phase contrast transmission electron microscopy (CTEM). Such schemes place low priority on focusing accuracy because with CTEM the defocus is accurately measured by contrast transfer function (CTF) fitting during data processing and some defocus variation is actually desirable and beneficial for the reconstruction (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cheng et al., 2015</a>). As shown later, using phase plates in-focus requires very accurate focusing. Therefore, we had to develop and apply a new data acquisition scheme."

The first one involves collecting data in a similar fashion as in CTEM, i.e. with an intentionally applied defocus. The CTF must then be fitted and corrected during data processing. The advantage of this approach is that precise focusing in not required and some defocus variation is actually desirable. Not having to focus accurately also speeds up the acquisition. The disadvantage is that the only benefit from using a phase plate is contract increase for the very low spatial frequencies whereas the remainder of the frequency spectrum has multiple CTF zeroes, like in CTEM. Also, because of the phase plate, fitting the CTF requires an additional phase shift parameter which may reduce the accuracy of the fit. The second and ideal SPA acquisition scheme with a phase plate is to collect data in-focus. The advantage of this approach is that there are no CTF zeroes across the frequency spectrum and there is no need to fit and correct the CTF. However, this approach is more demanding on the experiment in that it requires very accurate focusing. Also, if there are small random defocus errors they cannot be corrected during data processing because fitting the CTF without at least a few detectable CTF zeroes is practically impossible. In our initial SPA trials with the VPP we also tried the defocused approach but without much success (unpublished data), mainly because of the lack of phase shift support in the single particle reconstruction software. Future software developments could change the status quo and make the defocused approach more attractive, but so far we have had more success with the in-focus approach (<a href=\"#bib16\">Khoshouei et al., 2016</a>)."

We use the term 'in-focus' also for small (&lt;100 nm) defocus values which are used to counteract the effect of spherical aberration and extend the resolution range by moving the first CTF zero to higher spatial frequencies. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> shows simulated CTFs for a \u03c0/2 phase plate at three defocus values. The figure illustrates what would be an acceptable defocus range for a 4\u2009\u00c5 resolution SPA reconstruction. The resolution criterion we used is CTF amplitude dropping below 0.5, i.e. |CTF|=0.5. The zero defocus curve (dashed line) illustrates the effect of spherical aberration on the CTF. The CTF crosses the 0.5 level at a resolution lower than 4\u2009\u00c5. Small amounts of underfocus (defocus &lt; 0) counter the effect of spherical aberration and extend the region of good information transfer to higher resolutions. The red curve shows the minimum defocus (\u22127 nm) required to reach 4\u2009\u00c5 resolution according to the |CTF|=0.5 criterion. Increasing the defocus improves the resolution further but at higher defocus values the initially flat part of the CTF starts to develop a dip, as illustrated by the blue curve (defocus -60 nm). This imposes a limit on the maximum defocus value."

In order to achieve the required nanometer-level focusing precision we implemented a double focusing area acquisition scheme. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows an illustration of the scheme superposed on a holey support film. The defocus was measured on opposite sides, areas F1 and F2, of the data acquisition area D and the average (linear interpolation) was used to correct the focus. Such measurement minimizes errors due to local slant of the support film. We measured up to 400 nm defocus difference across the two sides (3.0 um distance) of holes on Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3 holey carbon grids. This would mean that a single focusing area acquisition scheme will have a defocus error of up to 200 nm which is substantial compared to the values in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. That provides a plausible explanation for the lower resolution (~8\u2009\u00c5) reconstructions we obtained when using a conventional single focusing area scheme. To improve the accuracy even further the double area focusing was iterated 2 or 3 times depending on how fast it was converging (we typically aimed at +/\u2212 10 nm from the target defocus). In order to prevent errors due to objective lens hysteresis the defocus was measured without applying a defocus offset during the measurement.

The most commonly used method to measure defocus is the beam tilt method (<a href=\"#bib17\">Koster et al., 1987</a>). It uses the shift between images taken with tilted beams to calculate the defocus. The effect of spherical aberration on the measurement is usually ignored because its contribution is small compared to the typical defocus values used in CTEM. Spherical aberration has an effect equal to a defocus of \u25b3<i>z</i> =<i>C</i><sub>S</sub><i>\u03b2</i><sup>2</sup>, where <i>C</i><sub>S</sub> is the spherical aberraton coefficient and <i>\u03b2</i> is the beam tilt angle (<a href=\"#bib17\">Koster et al., 1987</a>, equation 2). A commonly used tilt angle value is 5 mrad but in our experiments we used 10 mrad in order to improve the sensitivity of the measurement and to move the spots created on the VPP by the tilted beams further away from the central spot. On an FEI Titan Krios microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) a 10 mrad beam tilt places the beam spot at a position corresponding to <i>k</i> = <i>\u03b2</i> /<i>\u03bb</i> = 0.01\u2009rad / 0.002 nm = 5 nm<sup>-1\u00a0</sup>spatial frequency or 2\u2009\u00c5 resolution (<i>\u03bb</i> is the electron wavelength). This prevents the phase shifting spots created on the phase plate by the tilted beams from disturbing the CTF in the usable frequency range. The spots themselves are beneficial for the focusing because they act as phase plates themselves and increase the contrast of the tilted beam images, thus facilitating the measurement."

Series of images were recorded automatically on carbon film parts of the sample with -1.5\u2009\u03bcm defocus to facilitate phase shift measurement through CTF fitting. The CTFs of the image series were fitted with the latest version of ctffind4 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</a>) which supports phase shift. The results from two image series recorded at two consecutive positions on the VPP are plotted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. Both series show very similar behavior indicating that there are no significant variations in performance between neighboring positions on the phase plate. The phase shift has a rapid onset in the beginning of the series but the rate of its development slows down as the series progress. The results reproduce well the previously reported VPP behavior (<a href=\"#bib11\">Danev et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). During single particle data acquisition we try to prevent the phase shift from going much over \u03c0/2 by periodically moving to a new position on the phase plate (depending on the experimental conditions, every 25 to 50 images). Changing the phase plate position more often increases the risk of astigmatism due to variations in the phase plate film quality. Therefore, it is desirable to have a phase plate with a slower rate of phase shift development. In practice the rate can be reduced by increasing the phase plate heating temperature (<a href=\"#bib11\">Danev et al., 2014</a>) but in the current VPP generation such control is quite limited by the specifications of the heater."

According to the values of the phase shift in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and comparing them with the curves in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> the -50 nm defocus dataset should have matched or exceeded the performance of the -20 nm defocus dataset. This would suggest that either there was a small systematic focusing error or a variation in the phase plate performance. The black square in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> is for a VPP dataset collected on an FEI Tecnai F20 microscope equipped with an FEI Falcon II (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) direct detector camera. This microscope operates at 200 kV and uses a side-entry cryo-holder. It is inferior to the FEI Titan Krios microscope in both optical performance and specimen stage stability but the obtained resolution of 4.5\u2009\u00c5 is still respectable for such a system. The orange circle shows the result from <a href=\"#bib3\">Campbell et al. (2015)</a>, and is at 2.8\u2009\u00c5 with 49,954 particles. In that work a much larger dataset of ~1000 micrographs was collected which was then subjected to CTF screening and only 193 micrographs (~19% of the original dataset) were selected for data processing. We performed only visual pre-screening of the datasets and excluded micrographs that had obvious faults, such as broken ice, large contaminants or duplicate exposures. Consequently, we used ~80% of the original micrographs for data processing. The smaller number of micrographs combined with the fact that our data was not collected in 'super resolution' mode of the K2 camera (the data in <a href=\"#bib3\">Campbell et al, 2015</a>, was collected in 'super resolution' mode) could explain the slightly lower resolution of our reconstructions."

The ~2000 picked particles from each dataset were subjected directly to a single 3D refinement run in Relion without initial classification, movie processing or particle 'polishing'. The results are shown with triangles in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>. The resolution of the VPP reconstruction was better than the CTEM one by ~ 0.3\u2009\u00c5 (3.9\u2009\u00c5 vs 4.2\u2009\u00c5).

Further practical experience with the phase plate will help to improve the performance. The main factors that currently limit the performance are focusing accuracy, spherical aberration and variation in phase shift. We used a constant amount of defocus for the VPP datasets but a better approach would be to adjust the amount of defocus according to the phase shift. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> the optimal defocus varies with phase shift. The amount of defocus could be adjusted depending on the number of images already acquired at the current phase plate position. The phase shift versus number of images has to be calibrated in advance, as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. Furthermore, the defocused acquisition approach with a phase plate has to be explored. It is much simpler from a data collection point of view because it does not require precise focusing and has a higher data acquisition throughput, equal to that of CTEM. Future tests are needed to determine which approach is more efficient and to establish if either approach has an advantage for difficult samples."

Because of the high contrast it provides the VPP could be an ideal tool for quick sample screening and/or initial model building. With the in-focus approach the need for precise focusing reduced the image throughput about ~1.7 times (VPP 27 vs CTEM 45 micrographs per hour). Furthermore, setting up VPP experiments is more demanding in terms of user experience. Thus for 'easy' targets, such as relatively big particles and/or such with high symmetry the CTEM can still be more time efficient for achieving high resolutions. In this work we used such a target in order to evaluate the overall performance of the VPP. The full potential of the VPP in terms of improved contrast and uniform spectral coverage will be truly tested and demonstrated by difficult targets, such as small, flexible or heterogeneous samples (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hall et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Khoshouei et al., 2016</a>). We expect that for such targets the extra effort for using the VPP will pay off in terms of getting better reconstructions or a reconstruction at all. Therefore, the possibilities offered by the VPP could help to widen the target size overlap between cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography."

The acquisition conditions on the FEI Titan Krios were as follows: EFTEM microprobe mode, magnification 37,000x, 50\u2009\u03bcm C2 aperture, spot size 6, 1.4\u2009\u03bcm beam diameter, zero-loss imaging with 20 eV slit, K2 Summit in counting mode, pixel size 1.35\u2009\u00c5, total dose 30 e<sup>-</sup>/ \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, dose rate on the detector 9.1 e<sup>-</sup>/pixel/s, exposure time 6\u2009s, 12 frames 0.5\u2009s each. The FEI Tecnai F20 was equipped with an FEI Falcon II direct detector, a Gatan 626 cryo-holder and an FEI phase plate.

On both microscopes we used SerialEM software (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mastronarde, 2005</a>) with custom macros for automated single particle data acquisition. For the VPP datasets we used a macro to realize the dual focusing scheme shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> with focusing parameters in SerialEM set to: beam tilt angle 10 mrad, focus offset 0, drift protection ON (three image focusing). The focusing mode had identical optical settings as the record mode. The focusing macro measured the defocus on opposite sides of the acquisition area and used the average to correct the defocus. The macro was iterated 3 times to improve the accuracy. To take into account the effect of spherical aberration on the measured defocus (\u25b3<i>z</i> =<i>C</i><sub>S</sub><i>\u03b2</i> <sup>2</sup>) 270 nm was added to the target defocus on the FEI Titan Krios (spherical aberration 2.7\u2009mm), i.e. 250 nm target defocus for the -20 nm VPP dataset and 220 nm for the -50 nm VPP dataset. On the FEI Tecnai F20 (spherical aberration 2.1\u2009mm) 210 nm was added, i.e. 190 nm target defocus for the -20 nm VPP dataset. The phase plate was automatically moved to a new position with a 20\u2009\u03bcm step every one hour. For the CTEM datasets a single focusing was performed on one side of the acquisition area with drift protection set to OFF in SerialEM to provide more defocus spread. The dataset was collected with a 70\u2009\u03bcm objective aperture and a defocus range of -0.8 to -1.7\u2009\u03bcm. The acquisition speed was ~27 images/hour for the VPP and ~45 images/hour for the CTEM. The datasets consisted of: Titan Krios VPP \u221220 nm defocus 200 images, VPP \u221250 nm defocus 111 images, CTEM 338 images and Tecnai F20 VPP -20 nm defocus 199 images. The phase shift data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> was recorded on the FEI Titan Krios microscope. The optical and acquisition parameters were set to the same values as for the 20S datasets. The beam current was measured by the fluorescent screen of the microscope to be 0.162 nA. Thus the 6\u2009s exposure per image added 0.162 nA x 6\u2009s = 0.97 nC dose to the phase plate. Images were recorded using the same SerialEM macros as for the 20S datasets except the record area was set to be on the carbon film part between the holes of a Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3 plunge-frozen grid. Before each image focusing was performed only once on an adjacent carbon film area with target defocus set to -1.5\u2009\u03bcm."

The specimen consisted of 20 S proteasomes, and the use of single-particle data-processing resulted in a three-dimensional reconstruction at a resolution of 3.2 \u00c5. Although the authors produced a similar result from images obtained by defocusing the image, this work is still exceptionally innovative and important because it demonstrates that the phase plate does not introduce some unforeseen factor that limits the resolution. With that issue now settled, future work is expected to show whether the higher contrast, provided when using a phase plate, is able to significantly extend the capabilities of single-particle cryo-EM, especially in the case of structures much smaller than the proteasome. Therefore, all three reviewers heartily recommend publication in <i>eLife</i>."
