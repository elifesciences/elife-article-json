Combined with a 7.5 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction of the minimal complex between LdcI and the LdcI-binding domain of RavA, and the previously solved crystal structures of the individual components, this work enables to build a reliable pseudoatomic model of this unusual architecture and to identify conformational rearrangements and specific elements essential for complex formation. The design of the cage created via lateral interactions between five RavA rings is unique for the diverse AAA+ ATPase superfamily."

Combined with a 7.5 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction of the minimal complex between LdcI and the LdcI-binding domain of RavA, and the previously solved crystal structures of the individual components, this work enables to build a reliable pseudoatomic model of this unusual architecture and to identify conformational rearrangements and specific elements essential for complex formation.

The result is a novel cage-like structure composed by two double pentamers of LdcI, which are parallel to each other and linked together by five hexamers of RavA.

The name of this superfamily, \u2018<span class=\"underline\">A</span>TPase <span class=\"underline\">A</span>ssociated with Diverse Cellular <span class=\"underline\">A</span>ctivities\u2019, reflects this remarkable versatility. Widespread among bacteria and archea, members of the MoxR family of AAA+ ATPases are important modulators of multiple stress tolerance pathways (<a href=\"#bib20\">Snider et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Wong and Houry, 2012</a>). The best characterized MoxR representative, the RavA protein, has been recently associated to oxidative stress, antibiotic resistance and iron-sulfur cluster assembly in <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Babu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wong et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, it is involved in acid stress and nutrient stress responses via its interaction with the acid stress-inducible lysine decarboxylase LdcI, which buffers the bacterial cytoplasm by transforming lysine into cadaverine while consuming intracellular protons and producing CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Sabo et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Soksawatmaekhin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Snider et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Wong and Houry, 2012</a>). We recently demonstrated that RavA prevented binding of LdcI to its potent inhibitor, the stringent response alarmone, ppGpp (<a href=\"#bib3\">El Bakkouri et al., 2010</a>). Thus the LdcI\u2013RavA complex maintains LdcI activity even if the bacterium experiences both acid stress and starvation, as it is often the case in the host stomach through which enterobacteria transit before reaching the bowel where the pathogenesis typically occurs (<a href=\"#bib3\">El Bakkouri et al., 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "The crystal structures of both individual components of the complex provided important insights into their function (<a href=\"#bib3\">El Bakkouri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Kanjee et al., 2011</a>). However, the structural principles of the LdcI\u2013RavA interaction are puzzling. Indeed, RavA is a 300 kDa lily-shaped hexameric ring (<a href=\"#bib3\">El Bakkouri et al., 2010</a>), whereas LdcI is a 800 kDa toroid composed of two pentameric rings stacked together back-to-back (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kanjee et al., 2011</a>). But how can a hexamer bind a double pentamer? The strength of the interaction (K<sub>d</sub> of about 20 nM) between these two symmetry mismatched proteins and the resulting mass of 3.3 MDa inferred from analytical ultracentrifugation came out as a surprise (<a href=\"#bib20\">Snider et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">El Bakkouri et al., 2010</a>). The \u223c35 \u00c5 resolution of our first negative stain electron microscopy (EM) reconstruction was however so low that the assembly strategy of the complex, seemingly composed of two LdcI decamers and five RavA hexamers, appeared even more enigmatic (<a href=\"#bib20\">Snider et al., 2006</a>). We biochemically showed that the foot of RavA, inserted into the discontinuous triple helical bundle protruding as a leg from the AAA+ ATPase core, is necessary and sufficient for LdcI binding, albeit with a three orders of magnitude lower affinity. We therefore called this foot domain LARA for \u2018LdcI associating domain of RavA\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib3\">El Bakkouri et al., 2010</a>). Yet, although speculations were tempting, correct interpretation of the structural bases of the LdcI\u2013RavA interaction was impossible. Hence it was imperative to provide higher resolution insights into the design principles of this intriguing architecture."

The astounding LdcI\u2013RavA assembly is reminiscent of a symmetrical floral pattern, featuring two parallel five-petal blossoms of LdcI festooned by a garland of five RavA lilies. The entire complex possesses the dihedral fivefold symmetry of the lysine decarboxylase and a large central cavity of 3 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> \u00c5<sup>3</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1 fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Upon complex formation, the RavA hexamer loses its sixfold circular symmetry. The compact outward-pointing hub formed by the six AAA+ modules remains virtually unchanged and the ATP binding sites preserved, whereas the legs massively rearrange in order to comply with the dihedral symmetry of the whole assembly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Four protomers of each of the five RavA hexamers are involved in the interaction with the LdcI, while the remaining two legs of each hexamer mediate the RavA\u2013RavA interaction at the equator of the complex (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

The triskelion configuration and the loop (amino acids 329\u2013360) at the beginning of the LARA domain allow the optimal positioning of each LARA domain for interaction with LdcI subunits. Indeed, in the context of the complex, the two rings of each LdcI particle are not placed equivalently\u2014one ring of each LdcI faces the exterior of the complex, while the second faces the cavity. Remarkably, one leg of the RavA triskelion stretches its foot out in order to present the LARA domain to the subunits of the inner ring of LdcI from above, while in the second leg the N-terminus of the loop sharply bends, allowing the foot to interact with the outer ring of LdcI from underneath (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The results are consistent with the resulting pseudoatomic model and identify residues essential for complex stability (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Thus, critical residues in LdcI required for RavA binding were found to be E634 and Y697, both part of a C-terminal \u03b2-sheet (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A,C,D</a>). The charged residues R347 and R348 and the hydrophobic residues I343 and F344 at the tip of the LARA domain loop are required for RavA binding to LdcI (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013D</a>). Hence, the data suggest that the interaction between the two proteins is mediated both by charged and hydrophobic residues. Moreover, shortening the loop by deleting residues 329\u2013335, or constraining its N-terminus by introducting two prolines (S331P, D332P), weakens or abolishes the LdcI\u2013RavA complex formation (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013D</a>). Finally, mutating residues R315 and E452 in the first and second helices of the RavA triple helical bundle, respectively, destabilized complex formation (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A,E,F</a>) suggesting that the RavA\u2013RavA leg\u2013leg interaction is mediated by these two helices."

This loop therefore clearly emerges as the main determinant of the LdcI\u2013RavA cage formation. While the 7.5 \u00c5 resolution of the current LdcI-LARA reconstruction precludes building a reliable pseudoatomic model of the 329\u2013360 LARA domain loop based on the experimental EM density, its structural plasticity is obviously essential to fullful this role (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Indeed, clathrin is a triskelion-shaped trimer with a compact hub jutting out three alpha-superhelical legs tipped with a domain that interacts with adapters and cargo molecules. Clathrin triskelia assemble in vitro into cages of pentagons and hexagons, the hubs representing the cage vertices and the helical legs intertwining between vertices in a two-fold symmetrical manner to create the edges.In the case of the LdcI\u2013RavA cage, the LARA domain feet appear to be specifically evolved for the LdcI binding (<a href=\"#bib3\">El Bakkouri et al., 2010</a>). The equatorial vertices of the cage are provided by the hub made by the AAA+ domains of RavA, whereas the edges are created by the triple helical legs related by a twofold symmetry and intertwining between two adjacent AAA+ domain vertices. The fact that LdcI\u2013RavA complex and eukaryotic vesicle coats have certain architectural principles in common is striking, because the LdcI\u2013RavA architecture is remarkably different from all AAA+ ATPase assemblies described so far. Indeed, to our knowledge it is the only complex (out of 30 released EM maps in EMDB and 43 oligomeric crystal structures in PDB in July 2014) composed of several laterally interacting AAA+ ATPase rings, and the only one enclosing a central cavity other than the cavity framed by the AAA+ modules assembled into a ring or a spiral."

One may posit an explanation based on the markedly higher stability of the entire LdcI\u2013RavA complex compared to the LdcI-LARA complex: the scaffold provided by the AAA+ hub and the triple helical legs of RavA is required to glue the LARA domain in place and effectively preclude ppGpp binding. Noteworthy, the LARA foot binds \u223c30 \u00c5 away from the closest ppGpp binding pocket. Thus, contrary to our earlier prediction based on the low resolution negative stain EM map (<a href=\"#bib20\">Snider et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">El Bakkouri et al., 2010</a>), the LARA domain does not appear to directly block the access of ppGpp to its binding pocket but rather to induce a local conformational change in this pocket reducing ppGpp affinity."

Along these lines, an involvement of RavA and its binding partner, a VWA-domain protein ViaA, in the Fe\u2013S cluster assembly and particular respiratory pathways (<a href=\"#bib1\">Babu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wong et al., 2014</a>) and a physical interaction of RavA, ViaA (<a href=\"#bib26\">Wong et al., 2014</a>) and LdcI (<a href=\"#bib4\">Erhardt et al., 2012</a>) with specific subunits of the highly conserved respiratory complex I (<a href=\"#bib4\">Erhardt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wong et al., 2014</a>) were recently documented. Our structure of the exquisite LdcI\u2013RavA cage substantiates a hypothesis that it may act as a chaperone, protecting substrates from denaturation or disassembly under acid stress conditions inside the central cavity, and spurs on further functional investigation. Here we unraveled the layout principles of the unique LdcI\u2013RavA edifice, elucidated conformational rearrangements and specific elements essential for complex formation, and made a step towards general understanding how Nature elegantly solves the problem of the symmetry mismatch between individual components of protein complexes."

For example, the fit of the crystal structures of the LdcI and the LARA domain of RavA into the LdcI-LARA reconstruction clearly shows that the \u03b2-strands 632\u2013636 and 696\u2013698 of the LdcI are involved in the interaction with the loop 329\u2013360 of the LARA domain. In the case of the LdcI, both \u03b2-strands being strictly conserved between the three bacterial species compared, a charged (E634) and a hydrophobic (Y697) residue were chosen to probe the interaction and mutated into an oppositely charged (E634K) and a polar uncharged (Y697S) residue. Mutating the LdcI residues D638 and E681, situated further away from the indicated \u03b2-sheet did not affect the RavA\u2013LdcI interaction (data not shown). In the case of the LARA domain of RavA, the loop 329\u2013360 could not be modeled based on the current resolution of the EM map. Moreover, this loop appeared to be the main determinant of the LdcI\u2013RavA interaction and to undergo major conformational rearrangements in comparison to the crystal structures of the RavA monomer (see the main text and the methods below). Therefore the length of the loop (deletion of amino acids 329\u2013335), the flexibility of its N-terminus (S331P, D332P), as well as four residues in the middle of the loop which might be involved in the interaction (two charged, R347 and R348, and two hydrophobic, I343 and F344) were chosen for mutations (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

The density of the LARA domain (residues 361\u2013424, pdb 3NBX) was extracted and the LARA atomic model reliably rigidly fitted using SITUS (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wriggers, 2012</a>). Subtle domain movements being noted in the LdcI structure as compared to the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3D,E</a>), the LdcI density was extracted and used for flexible fitting with Flex-EM (<a href=\"#bib23\">Topf et al., 2008</a>). LdcI crystal structure was divided into three rigid bodies: the wing domain (residues 1\u2013128), an intermediate domain (residues 131\u2013142, 145\u2013382, 386\u2013397, 402\u2013495, 527\u2013562) and a C-terminal domain (residues 501\u2013521 and 566\u2013710), leaving inter-domains flexible. The C\u03b1 RMSD between the initial pdb of the LdcI monomer model and the final Flex-EM model is 0.65 \u00c5. The cross correlation values between the cryoEM map and either the rigidly fitted monomer or the final Flex-EM model are 0.75 and 0.84 respectively. The FSC curves between the cryoEM map and either the rigid fit or the Flex-EM model give an FSC = 0.5 at 11 \u00c5 resolution and 8.3 \u00c5 resolution respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>)."

In order to take advantage of the higher resolution of the LdcI-LARA map, the LdcI-LARA fit was kept fixed for the LdcI\u2013RavA fitting. Thus, only the AAA+ ATPase domain and the triple helical domains of RavA (pdb 3NBX) remained to be fitted. The initial rigid fit of these domains using UCSF Chimera fit-in-map module indicated that the AAA+ ATPase domain position was conserved compared to the isolated RavA structure, maintaining the integrity of the ATPase active sites. The rigid fit also revealed that RavA binding to LdcI required movements of the triple-helix domains to bring the LARA domains in their LdcI-interacting position, whereas the RavA legs involved in RavA\u2013RavA equatorial interactions barely moved in comparison to the isolated RavA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In order to propose a pseudoatomic model of RavA in its LdcI-binding state, RavA flexible fitting was thus performed using Flex-EM. The ATPase domains (residues 1\u2013268), the triple helical bundles (residues 274\u2013329, 444\u2013496) and the LARA domains (residues 361\u2013424) were considered as rigid, leaving inter-domains flexible. The LARA domains were given as initial position their position in LdcI-LARA maps, and the initial positions of the AAA+ ATPase domains were those of the rigid body fit. 25 cycles of Flex-EM led to improved position of triple-helix domains leaving the AAA+ ATPase and LARA domain fit quasi unchanged. The versatile 330\u2013360 loop of the LARA domain was omitted from the models because it clearly undergoes major rearrangements that cannot be reasonably modeled based on the current quality of the EM maps."

Interestingly, the FSC curve between the LdcI-LARA part of the LdcI\u2013RavA map and its Flex-EM model has an FSC = 0.5 at 11 \u00c5 resolution, whereas the FSC curve between the equatorial region of the map (corresponding to the AAA+ domain core and the triple helical domains of RavA) and its Flex-EM model has an FSC = 0.5 at 20 \u00c5 resolution. This difference in the local quality of the Flex-EM model can be explained by (i) the better quality of the Flex-EM model of the LdcI-LARA region (because this part of the model is based on the higher resolution LdcI-LARA map), and (ii) the better definition of the LdcI-LARA region of the LdcI\u2013RavA map in comparison to the equatorial region corresponding to the AAA+ domain core and the triple helical domains of RavA."
