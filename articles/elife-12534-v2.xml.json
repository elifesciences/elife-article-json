Replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP2 was reported to be required for activation of muscle-gene expression. The lack of a developmental phenotype in TBP2 null mice prompted further analysis to determine whether TBP2 deficiency can compromise adult myogenesis. We show here that TBP2 null mice have an intact regeneration potential upon injury and that TBP2 is not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cell or in primary mouse MuSCs. While TFIID subunits and TBP are downregulated during myoblast differentiation, reduced amounts of these proteins form a complex that is detectable on promoters of muscle genes and is essential for their expression. This evidence demonstrates that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed, with limiting amounts of TFIID-TBP being required to promote muscle-specific gene expression."

Replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP2 was reported to be required for activation of muscle-gene expression. The lack of a developmental phenotype in TBP2 null mice prompted further analysis to determine whether TBP2 deficiency can compromise adult myogenesis. We show here that TBP2 null mice have an intact regeneration potential upon injury and that TBP2 is not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cell or in primary mouse MuSCs. While TFIID subunits and TBP are downregulated during myoblast differentiation, reduced amounts of these proteins form a complex that is detectable on promoters of muscle genes and is essential for their expression. This evidence demonstrates that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed, with limiting amounts of TFIID-TBP being required to promote muscle-specific gene expression."

The TFIID complex is composed of TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Roeder, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tora, 2002</a>). Moreover, several TBP-related factors (TRFs) have been identified (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akhtar and Veenstra, 2011</a>), expanding the repertoire and versatility of the basal transcription machinery (<a href=\"#bib34\">M\u00fcller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">M\u00fcller et al., 2007</a>).

Further work has revealed that the alternative core factor TAF3, which is known to recognize histone H3K4me3 - a histone modification associated with active promoters (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vermeulen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">van Ingen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lauberth et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Stijf-Bultsma et al., 2015</a>) - mediates interactions between MyoD, permissive chromatin and PICs at promoters of muscle-specific genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Deato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yao et al., 2011</a>). This finding suggested that the widely established paradigm of a universal and prevalent use of TFIID as a promoter-recognizing complex in a variety of somatic cells might undergo drastic change during development. Nevertheless this hypothesis has been challenged by the observation that TBP2 null (TBP2_KO = TBP2 knock out) mice do not display any skeletal muscle phenotype (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gazdag et al., 2009</a>), indicating that TBP2 is dispensable for developmental myogenesis (see <a href=\"http://www.europhenome.org/databrowser/viewer.jsp?set=true&amp;m=true&amp;x=Both%20Split&amp;ln=Tbp2&amp;project=All&amp;zygosity=All&amp;m=true&amp;l=10386\">http://www.europhenome.org/databrowser/viewer.jsp?set=true&amp;m=true&amp;x=Both Split&amp;ln=Tbp2&amp;project=All&amp;zygosity=All&amp;m=true&amp;l=10386</a>). However, Gazdag et al. did not explore the integrity of the regeneration potential of skeletal muscles in TBP2 null mice during adult life, and thus have not ruled out the possibility that TBP2 can specifically promote the expression of muscle genes in muscle stem (satellite) cells (MuSCs) - the direct effectors of post-natal and adult skeletal myogenesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chang and Rudnicki, 2014</a>)."

Two key molecular events that invariably coincide with MuSC activation and commitment toward myogenic differentiation are (i) the expression of skeletal muscle transcription master regulator MyoD (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zammit et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tapscott, 1988</a>) and (ii) the activation of the p38 signaling (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jones et al., 2005</a>). These pathways cooperate to promote SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling and to increase levels of the active chromatin mark H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernstein et al., 2005</a>) at promoters of muscle genes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Simone, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Rampalli et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Forcales et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, studies from the Rando group have revealed that in activated MuSCs the large majority of muscle gene promoters show enrichment in H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). Collectively, the data described above suggest that the H3K4me3 chromatin mark can mediate TAF3 recruitment to MyoD-target genes in activated MuSCs. Since TAF3 has been proposed as a mediator of TBP2 recruitment to muscle gene promoters (<a href=\"#bib7\">Deato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yao et al., 2011</a>), these data provide the rationale for investigating whether TBP2 deficiency can impair post-natal and adult skeletal myogenesis."

Notexin-mediated muscle injury triggers extensive muscle damage and stimulates adult muscle regeneration and post-natal myogenesis in vivo, during which damaged muscle is replaced by newly formed myofibers arising from activated MuSCs. Histological assessment of regenerating muscles showed a complete recovery of the muscle architecture, with abundant presence of centrally nucleated fibers in both wild type (WT) and TBP2 null muscles at 12 days post injury - a time point when muscle regeneration is near completion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Both WT and TBP2 null mice contain similar numbers of Pax7 positive MuSCs in a sub-laminar position within unperturbed muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> upper panel, 1C). This result indicates that there are no defects in MuSC ontogenesis in the absence of <i>Tbpl2</i> expression. Importantly, we detected comparable numbers of MuSCs in muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice 12 days after injury (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> lower panel, <a href=\"#fig1\">1C</a>), indicating an intact capacity of adult MuSCs to proliferate, self-renew and differentiate during ongoing muscle regeneration in the absence of TBP2. Finally, we used Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting (FACS) to isolate MuSCs from skeletal muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice before and 12 days after notexin-mediated injury, and analyzed their intrinsic myogenic potential ex vivo Cultures of MuSCs from all conditions yielded a comparable number of Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC)-positive multinucleated myotubes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>), demonstrating that MuSCs from TBP2 null muscles have the identical myogenic potential of MuSCs from WT mice as they can readily differentiate into myotubes with equal capacity upon exposure to differentiation conditions in vitro."

We have quantified the differentiation index, the percentage of nuclei within myotubes of differentiated C2C12, to illustrate better the impaired differentiation potential of C2C12 in the absence of TBP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). mRNA analysis of skeletal muscle specific genes <i>Myog, Ckm</i> and <i>Acta1</i> demonstrates an impaired activation of the skeletal muscle program in the absence of TBP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

To test this hypothesis we have set out to detect expression of TAF subunits of the TFIID complex in both cultured C2C12 and MuSC myoblasts and myotubes at the RNA and protein levels. We observe a downregulation of mRNA expression of the TFIID subunits TBP and TAFs in myotubes derived from both C2C12s (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and from MuSCs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), compared to undifferentiated cells (myoblasts). Next, we further analyzed the protein levels of TFIID subunits in myoblasts and in myotubes by immunoblot analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Indeed, TFIID subunits were detected in C2C12 nuclear extracts prepared from both proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes, with a concomitant downregulation of most TFIID subunits also at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), as previously observed (<a href=\"#bib6\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). To demonstrate the purity of the myoblasts and myotubes isolated in our experimental conditions, we monitored the protein expression of the cell cycle protein Cyclin D1, which is typically expressed in myoblasts and downregulated during muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We also analyzed markers of myogenic differentiation, such as Myogenin, Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC) and Actinin 3, (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Expression of these proteins is specific for either myoblasts (Cyclin D1) or myotubes (Myogenin, MHC, Actinin 3), and demonstrates the high purity of the cell populations used in our study, confirming that detection of TFIID subunits in myotubes is not due to contamination with undifferentiated myoblasts."

We found that TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes derived from either C2C12 myoblasts, nor from primary mouse MuSCs. Consistently, TBP2-deficient mice displayed an intact regeneration potential, and MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild type MuSCs. This evidence firmly supports the conclusion that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed by Deato et al. (<a href=\"#bib6\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>)."

Recently, a mechanism for ubiquitination-mediated downregulation of TBP protein in skeletal myotubes was reported (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, the plausible scenario in skeletal muscle specific transcription is that limited TFIID helps to restrict the assembly of the transcription competent PIC at a selected subset of muscle specific genes."

It has been also shown that MyoD efficiently stimulated TFIID-dependent basal transcription (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heller and Bengal, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dilworth, 2004</a>). Moreover, an endogenous interaction between MyoD and TBP in both myoblasts and myotubes was demonstrated, and in myotubes, MyoD and components of PIC TBP and TFIIB were found to be recruited to the proximal promoter of the <i>alpha-sarcoglycan</i> muscle gene promoter (<a href=\"#bib8\">Delgado-Olgu\u00edn et al., 2006</a>). The relevance of TBP-mediated activation of MyoD target genes has been recently emphasized by the finding that large polyglutamine (PolyQ) repeats in TBP causes muscle degeneration, by reducing the expression of muscle-specific genes, due to a decreased association of TBP with MyoD (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2015</a>). This finding reiterates the importance of clarifying the identity of the proteins that compose the core promoter basal machinery required for muscle gene transcription in differentiating muscles, further extending the related implications to the pathogenesis of human muscular disorders."

This hypothesis has been challenged by the observation that TBP2_KO mice do not display any skeletal muscle phenotype, indicating that TBP2 is dispensable for developmental myogenesis. However, it remained possible that TBP2 was needed for the regeneration potential of skeletal muscles and the expression of muscle genes in muscle stem (satellite) cells (MuSCs). The results here are at odds with the latter possibility in revealing no defect in adult muscle regeneration or the differentiation potential of MuSCs ex vivo for TBP2 knock-out animals. The authors go on to provide evidence that TBP2 is not even expressed during differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into myotubes, although it could be detected in murine overies, while TBP and TAFs that comprise convential TFIID are readily detected. TBP2 expression can be observed in myotubes transfected with TBP2, but it has no effect on expression of muscle genes. They further demonstrate that down-regulation of TBP by siRNA impairs differentiation into large multinucleated myotubes and impaired activation of skeletal muscle specific genes. Thus, TBP2 is dispensable while TBP is required for differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes. In agreement with previous findings, they do observe a downregulation TBP and at least certain TFIID TAFs on differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, but the residual proteins appear to assemble into TFIID, based on coIP and co-sedimentation analyses, and they are found by ChIP at the promoters of muscle genes in myotubes, but not myoblasts, at levels comparable to those seen at constitutively expressed genes and in parallel with the increased occupancies of Pol II CTD-phosphorylated on Ser5 in myotubes. These findings provide strong evidence that TBP and TAFs that comprise conventional TFIID, rather than the TBP2/TAF3 complex, mediates the induction of muscle genes by MyoD on differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes. This conclusion is in accordance with the recent report that polyglutamine repeats in TBP evokes muscle degeneration by reducing the expression of muscle-specific genes, with decreased association of TBPwith MyoD."

This finding has been questioned by the lack of skeletal or muscular deficits in the TBP2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Gazdag et al., 2009). Malecova and collaborators extend the characterization of skeletal myogenesis in TBP2<sup>-/-</sup> mice demonstrating how TBP2 ablation does not affect muscle regeneration after injury. The authors document absence of TBP2 expression in both mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 and muscle stem cells (MuSCs). In addition, they show that reduced TBP expression impairs myoblast differentiation and expression of muscle-specific genes. Using both C2C12 and primary muscle stem cells they confirmed that TBP and the TFIID complex become expressed to lower levels during myogenic differentiation. ChIP assays reveal a direct involvement of TBP in the pre-initiation complex assembly at MyoD-regulated genes."

Healthy, unperturbed skeletal muscles are composed of myofibers whose nuclei are typically located at the periphery. Intramuscular injection of myotoxins, such as notexin, is widely used to induce regeneration (1, 2, 3, 4) and is typically ensued by an early phase of muscle degeneration characterized by myofibers necrosis, followed by inflammatory infiltration and activation of satellite cells. These events occur during the first 3-4 days post injury 3 and prevent an accurate measurement of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of myofibers, as the injured muscle area contains high amount of cellular infiltrate, with the large majority of myofibers being destroyed and/or deformed (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1A</a>, 3 days post injury). As such, CSA cannot be evaluated during the initial stage of regeneration. Starting from day 5 or 6 after injury, activated satellite cells begin to fuse into new myfibers and/or fuse with the pre-existing damaged myofibers (3). This regeneration process is typically completed around day 10 post myotoxin injection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1A</a>), resulting in the restoration of the original muscle architecture. Well-established hallmarks of regenerating muscle at this stage are: i) the presence of newly regenerating myofibers with a smaller CSA and ii) central nucleation3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1A</a>, 10 days post injury). Thus, in our experiments we have considered these two hallmarks to show that WT and TBP2_KO muscles were undergoing comparable regeneration, reflecting similar extent of injury. Indeed, we reasoned that failure to regenerate or weaker regeneration process would invariably lead to absence or reduction in number of centrally nucleated fibers by day 12 post-injury. On the other hand, failure to complete the regeneration process can be detected by the persistence of the inflammatory infiltrate at day 12 post-injury."

We have plotted the raw Ct values for each analyzed sample to illustrate the differential expression of the analyzed potential reference genes during muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 2</a>, high Ct value = low expression). The most stable gene that is in our hands not differentially expressed during muscle differentiation, considering an equal total RNA amount, is <i>Gapdh</i>.

While we acknowledge that the relationship between composition of the TFIID complex and SWI/SNF complex in myoblasts and myotubes builds directly on the discovery presented in this manuscript, we also note that it is part of an independent project that will need a substantial amount of work and that is clearly behind the timeframe of publication of the current manuscript.

We agree that it is easier to appreciate the downregulation of most of the TFIID subunits (except TAF2) on the protein level with the immunoblot quantification analysis. However, we have also noted that the antibodies against TBP, TAF2, TAF6, TAF10, MHC and Cyclin D1 do not react accordingly to the two-fold difference in amount of nuclear extract proteins on the immunoblot, since the quantified signals showed more than two-fold decrease in samples that were half amount of proteins. Therefore we believe that it would be incorrect and misleading to make any further quantitative conclusions about the extent of downregulation of the TFIID subunits on the protein level based on the immunoblot quantification. Therefore we are providing the quantification of immunoblot of two independent C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes preparation for an illustrative purpose in <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 3</a>."

Moreover, we have also performed ChIP experiments in our lab in differentiated C2C12 cells under the conditions of impaired skeletal muscle differentiation, when we downregulated Brg1 subunit of SWI/SNF chomatin remodeling complex (6, 7, 8). We observed that interference with the differentiation process leads to the targeted loss of recruitment of TBP and RNAPII-S5P on muscle promoters in our ChIP assays (data not shown)."
