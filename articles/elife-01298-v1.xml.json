Virulent <i>T. gondii</i> strains secrete kinases and pseudokinases that inactivate the immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins) responsible for mouse resistance to avirulent strains. Such considerations stimulated a search for IRG alleles unknown in laboratory mice that might confer resistance to virulent strains of <i>T. gondii</i>. We report that the mouse IRG system shows extraordinary polymorphic complexity in the wild. We describe an IRG haplotype from a wild-derived mouse strain that confers resistance against virulent parasites by interference with the virulent kinase complex. In such hosts virulent strains can encyst, hinting at an explanation for the evolution of virulence polymorphism in <i>T. gondii</i>."

Virulent <i>T. gondii</i> strains secrete kinases and pseudokinases that inactivate the immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins) responsible for mouse resistance to avirulent strains. Such considerations stimulated a search for IRG alleles unknown in laboratory mice that might confer resistance to virulent strains of <i>T. gondii</i>. We report that the mouse IRG system shows extraordinary polymorphic complexity in the wild. We describe an IRG haplotype from a wild-derived mouse strain that confers resistance against virulent parasites by interference with the virulent kinase complex. In such hosts virulent strains can encyst, hinting at an explanation for the evolution of virulence polymorphism in <i>T. gondii</i>."

It reproduces sexually inside its primary host\u2014the cat\u2014and produces eggs that are released in faeces. Other animals, most often rodents, can then become infected when they unknowingly eat the eggs while foraging. Once inside its new host, the parasite reproduces asexually until the rodent\u2019s immune system begins to fight back. It then becomes semi-dormant and forms cysts within the brain and muscle cells of its host. In an added twist, the parasite also causes rodents to lose their fear of cats. This increases their chances of being caught and eaten, thereby helping the parasite to return to its primary host and complete its life cycle."

Indeed it is in the interests of all hosts and most parasites to prolong the encounter. In this sense, virulence is a failure of co-adaptation. Haldane\u2019s conjecture (<a href=\"#bib28\">Haldane, 1949</a>) that intense and fluctuating selection imposed by parasites will generate host protein polymorphism is widely accepted (<a href=\"#bib57\">Woolhouse et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clark et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kosiol et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fumagalli et al., 2011</a>). The presence in a population of multiple host resistance alleles confronting multiple parasite virulence alleles may reflect a dynamic equilibrium permissive for the persistence of both parties. However this equilibrium is achieved only at the expense of individual interactions fatal for either the parasite or the host, as a consequence of confrontations of inappropriate alleles. In mammals, however, the ability of the adaptive immune system to respond within the time scale of an individual infection and to remember for a lifetime, buffers individuals against dangerous genetic novelty arising from parasites. As a result, life or death outcomes for common infectious diseases in mammals are not generally determined by single, highly penetrant, polymorphic genes. We here report such a case, involving infection of the house mouse, <i>Mus musculus,</i> with the ubiquitous intracellular protozoan parasite, <i>Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii</i> has a complex life cycle (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dubey, 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The sexual process occurs in true cats (Felidae) and intermediate hosts become infected by ingesting oocysts spread in cat faeces. A phase of fast intracellular replication and spread (tachyzoite phase) stimulates immunity in the intermediate host, and this in turn induces parasite encystment in brain and muscle cells and lifelong persistence. Predation of the infected host by a cat completes the life cycle. If immunity fails, tachyzoite replication continues uninterrupted, killing the infected host within a few days (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deckert-Schl\u00fcter et al., 1996</a>). Thus the probability that <i>T. gondii</i> completes its life cycle, which is roughly linear with duration of infection of the intermediate host, depends on early immune control."

Early immune control of <i>T. gondii</i> in mice depends on a family of IFN\u03b3-inducible cytoplasmic effector proteins, the 47 kDa immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins; for nomenclature of IRG genes and proteins see <a href=\"#bib5\">Bekpen et al. (2005)</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Martens and Howard (2006)</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Taylor et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Collazo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liesenfeld et al., 2011</a>). These assemble on the cytosolic face of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), causing its rupture and killing the included parasite (<a href=\"#bib40\">Martens et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhao et al., 2009b</a>). In the C57BL/6 (BL/6) laboratory mouse strain about 20 IRG genes occur in two adjacent clusters on chromosome 11 and one cluster on chromosome 18 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bekpen et al., 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The whole 47 kDa sequences of IRG proteins are typically translated from a single exon. Exceptional are certain \u2018tandem\u2019 IRGB proteins with a molecular weight of about 94 kDa. These genes are transcribed across two chromosomally adjacent IRG coding units and the intergenic spacer is spliced out as an intron resulting in a single open reading frame (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bekpen et al., 2005</a>. See also \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for a note on nomenclature of the tandem genes and proteins). IRG proteins fall into two major functional and sequence sub-families, the GKS group (IRGA, IRGB and IRGD proteins) that are effector proteins at the PVM, and the GMS group (Irgm1, Irgm2 and Irgm3) that are negative regulators of the GKS proteins (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hunn et al., 2008</a>). Many strains of <i>T. gondii</i> (e.g., the abundant Eurasian strains designated types II and III) are well controlled by the IRG system in laboratory mice, encyst, and are considered avirulent. But others (e.g., type I) are highly virulent (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sibley and Boothroyd, 1992</a>), killing the mouse host during the tachyzoite phase of infection. It has very recently been shown that virulence differences between <i>T. gondii</i> strains are largely due to polymorphic variation in ROP18 and ROP5 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Saeij et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Taylor et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Khan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Behnke et al., 2011</a>), members of a family of kinases and pseudokinases (<a href=\"#bib19\">El Hajj et al., 2006</a>). These proteins are secreted during parasite entry and accumulate on the cytosolic face of the PVM (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boothroyd and Dubremetz, 2008</a>). Virulent ROP allotypes inactivate IRG effector proteins by phosphorylating essential threonines in the nucleotide-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fentress et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Steinfeldt et al., 2010</a>). In view of the unique importance of <i>Mus musculus</i> for the transmission of <i>T. gondii</i>, parasite strains acutely lethal for mice should be counterselected. Their presence at a significant frequency therefore demands an explanation. In this paper, we reveal that the IRG resistance system in mice has a scale of polymorphic complexity that rivals the MHC, and that a resistant IRG haplotype in the mouse can counter polymorphic virulence factors in the parasite, generating a host phenotype that is permissive for encystment, and thus for the propagation, of virulent strains."

The re-sequenced mice are largely from established laboratory strains. Others are recently derived from the wild and not admixed with laboratory mice. <i>Mus spretus</i> is a wild species distinct from <i>Mus musculus</i> with a divergent history of 1\u20133 million years (<a href=\"#bib51\">Suzuki et al., 2004</a>). Within laboratory strains we found relatively little IRG protein polymorphism on Chr 11. In contrast, the wild-derived strains showed variation in IRG gene number and remarkable protein polymorphism. For example Irgb6, a protein of 406 residues, had an allele in the CAST/EiJ strain with 47 amino acid substitutions relative to BL/6. On Chr 18, IRG protein sequence variation between laboratory strains was more apparent, and again, wild-derived strains showed extensive sequence polymorphism and copy number variation. The IRG proteins of the outgroup, <i>M. spretus,</i> showed considerable protein divergence from <i>M. musculus</i> sequences. Pseudogenes occurred in every haplotype and some (e.g. <i>Irga5</i> and <i>Irgb7</i>) were preserved between <i>M. musculus</i> and <i>M. spretus</i>. Other IRG sequences were pseudogenes in some haplotypes and apparently intact in others, for example <i>Irga3</i> and <i>Irga8</i>. Even within this limited group of strains we can distinguish eleven distinct IRG gene haplotypes on Chr 11 and thirteen on Chr 18, already yielding a theoretical population diversity of several hundred IRG genotypes. Diagonal dot-plot comparisons between IRG gene clusters of wild-derived CAST/Ei and MSM/Ms with BL/6 showed IRG genes within tracts of duplication and deletion, associated with numerous repeats in both orientations, a genomic configuration that would be expected to be dynamic even on short time-scales, and doubtless responsible for the two very different dot-plots (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We analysed five IRG genes, namely <i>Irgm1</i>, a regulatory IRG protein of the GMS class (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hunn et al., 2008</a>), and <i>Irga6</i>, <i>Irgb2</i>, <i>Irgb6,</i> and <i>Irgb10</i>, all effector GKS proteins localizing to the <i>T. gondii</i> PVM during infection (<a href=\"#bib32\">Khaminets et al., 2010</a>). <i>Irgb2</i> forms the N-terminal half of the tandem protein, Irgb2-b1. The nearest-neighbour phylograms of <i>Irgm1</i>, <i>Irgb10</i> and <i>Irga6</i> are shallow and the <i>M. spretus</i> sequences fall into outgroups. Thus most of the sparse polymorphic variation in these sequences has been acquired since the divergence of <i>M. musculus</i> from <i>M</i>. <i>spretus.</i> This conclusion is supported by a tendency for individual minor variants to be concentrated in one or other of the three recent, geographically separated and partially isolated subspecies, <i>Mus musculus musculus</i>, <i>Mus musculus domesticus</i> and <i>Mus musculus castaneus</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2\u20134</a>). In contrast, the phylograms for <i>Irgb2</i> and <i>Irgb6</i> have a depth similar to the mouse-rat divergence (about 20 million years) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gibbs et al., 2004</a>), the <i>M. spretus</i> sequences are embedded in the <i>M. musculus</i> trees, and any tendency to correlation with subspecies is seen only in the outermost branches. Thus the polymorphism in these two genes is ancient and has persisted through a number of speciation events. The scale of polymorphism in the IRG system estimated by Tajima\u2019s \u03c0 from 7 mouse strains resembles that of classical <i>MHC</i> genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). That there is also considerable local polymorphism within geographic ranges was confirmed by the identification of numerous heterozygotes at all loci examined by PCR among the wild mouse captures."

The wild-derived Indian strain CIM, which has a number of divergent IRG alleles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), proved to be remarkably resistant to the type I virulent <i>T. gondii</i> strain, GT-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). All CIM mice survived intraperitoneal infection with GT-1 tachyzoites while all laboratory mice (NMRI strain) died within 15 days. In vitro, tachyzoite proliferation of avirulent strains in mouse cells is inhibited by induction of IRG proteins with IFN\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib34\">K\u00f6nen-Waisman and Howard, 2007</a>). In contrast, proliferation of type I virulent strains is not inhibited (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhao et al., 2009c</a>). By this assay, IFN\u03b3-induced CIM diaphragm-derived cells (DDC see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) inhibited proliferation of type I virulent RH-YFP strain tachyzoites as efficiently as they inhibited the proliferation of avirulent strains, while BL/6 DDC inhibited only the avirulent strains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Cells from two other <i>M. m. castaneus</i> strains, CAST/EiJ and CTP were almost as resistant as CIM. Additionally, IFN\u03b3-induced CIM cells died by reactive cell death after infection with both virulent RH-YFP and avirulent ME49, while BL/6 cells died only after infection with avirulent strains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Reactive death of <i>T. gondii</i>-infected mouse cells after induction with IFN\u03b3 is associated with IRG protein-mediated host resistance, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhao et al., 2009b</a>)."

Remarkably, in CIM cells infected with RH-YFP, phosphorylated Irga6<sub>CIM</sub> was barely detectable with an antiserum specific for Irga6<sub>BL/6</sub> phosphorylated at T108 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Irga6<sub>CIM</sub> differs from Irga6<sub>BL/6</sub> at only two residues, both distant from the phosphorylation sites and was phosphorylated normally when transfected into IFN\u03b3-induced L929 cells infected with virulent RH-YFP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Thus Irga6<sub>CIM</sub> apparently remains unphosphorylated in CIM cells as a result of active inhibition of the parasite kinase complex. The following experiment showed that the highly polymorphic tandem protein, Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub>, is largely responsible. Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> was transfected into IFN\u03b3-induced BL/6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with RH-YFP virulent strain <i>T. gondii</i>. Phosphorylated Irga6 was measured at the PVs in transfected cells expressing Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> and in untransfected cells. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a> show that the amount of phosphorylated Irga6 was strikingly reduced on vacuoles loaded with Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> while the amount of total Irga6 loaded onto Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> positive vacuoles was increased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Thus the decreased signal of phosphorylated Irga6 on the PVM was not caused by competition for loading between Irga6 and Irgb2-b1, but rather by inhibition of phosphorylation. Transfected Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> also stimulated the loading of endogenous Irgb6<sub>BL/6</sub> onto RH-YFP vacuoles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Transfected Irgb2-b1<sub>BL/6</sub>, which is well expressed unlike the endogenous protein, had little or no effect on the loading of Irgb6<sub>BL/6</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>).

Thus loading of Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> onto the PVM of ROP5-deficient RH strain parasites in CIM cells was greatly reduced, and consistently, the amount of loading on to different RH-related strains correlated with strain-specific variation in the amount of ROP5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> itself becomes phosphorylated during infection with virulent <i>T. gondii</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), thus is also a target for the active ROP5-ROP18 kinase complex, suggesting that Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> may block phosphorylation of Irga6 by binding ROP5 pseudokinase at the vacuole, thereby distracting rather than inhibiting ROP18 kinase. ROP5 binds to Irga6 via helix 4 (H4) of the Irga6 nucleotide binding domain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fleckenstein et al., 2012</a>), so a homologous structure on Irgb2-b1 may be involved in ROP5 interaction. Indeed the putative H4 and \u03b1D structural domains of the Irgb2 subunit are highly polymorphic and show recent divergent selection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), indicating possible co-evolution with ROP kinases and pseudokinases. The high polymorphism of H4 in Irgb2-b1 is also consistent with a direct interaction with a polymorphic component of the pathogen. If Irgb2-b1 interacts with a host protein to bridge to ROP5 the interaction surface between the two host proteins would not be expected to evolve rapidly under divergent selection."

We also provide a mechanistic explanation for the resistance of the CIM mouse against type I virulent <i>T. gondii</i> strains. Resistance is determined by the presence of the polymorphic tandem IRG protein, Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> encoded on Chr 11, which blocks the ROP5/ROP18 kinase complex of the virulent parasite, preventing phosphorylation and consequent inactivation of IRG effector proteins. Taken together, our results suggest a selective explanation for the evolution of <i>T. gondii</i> strains that are highly virulent for certain mice. If the mouse is an evolutionarily significant host for <i>T. gondii</i> the parasite must balance its virulence against mouse resistance, in order to allow encystment. To minimise the cost of infection, selection on the mouse favours the evolution of strong resistance alleles. This in turn leads to the selection of parasite strains able to counteract heightened resistance sufficiently to allow encystment in these mouse genotypes, as type I <i>T. gondii</i> strains in CIM mice. However such virulent <i>T. gondii</i> strains are counterselected by acute lethality in less resistant mice, while less resistant mice are better hosts for less virulent <i>T. gondii</i> strains."

Loss of the entire IRG system in several vertebrate groups, for example higher primates and birds (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bekpen et al., 2005</a>), suggests that possession of the IRG system may be costly. Highly resistant genotypes may be more costly than less resistant ones. Alternatively, molecular specificity in interactions between polymorphic parasite virulence factors and mouse IRG proteins may favour IRG genotypes that are highly resistant to some <i>T. gondii</i> genotypes but more susceptible to others. Such an allele-specific system is familiar from polymorphic plant disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes and strain-specific pathogen virulence and avirulence (<a href=\"#bib22\">Flor 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dodds et al., 2006</a>), where exact molecular matches or mismatches determine the outcome of a given infection. These alternative models can now be analysed formally and tested experimentally."

                        "text": "Much of the argument in this paper has focused on the importance of the house mouse as an intermediate host and vector for <i>T. gondii</i>, resting on the global abundance of the species and its sympatry with the cat, and obviously supported by the intimate antagonistic relationship between <i>T. gondii</i> virulence factors and mouse resistance factors. However, although many bacteria and protozoal parasites are not resisted by the IRG system, <i>T. gondii</i> is not the only organism that is. At least two members of the <i>Chlamydia</i> species complex are resisted by the IRG system in mice, and polymorphic variation on Chr 11, possibly associated with Irgb10, affects the level of resistance (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bernstein-Hanley et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Miyairi et al., 2007</a>). There will surely be other organisms that may contribute to the genomic complexity and polymorphism of the IRG system. For example, the massive and ancient polymorphism of Irgb6 is not directly accounted for by our experiments. In in vitro experiments in BL/6 cells transfected Irgb2-b1<sub>CIM</sub> protects Irga6 from phosphorylation in the absence of the CIM allotypes of the other IRG proteins including Irgb6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and in the CAST/Ei strain, which is almost as resistant as CIM against <i>T. gondii</i>, Irgb6 is barely expressed (unpublished results). It may be that Irgb6 polymorphism reflects a pattern of resistance against another abundant mouse pathogen. However it is also not excluded that Irgb6 polymorphisms relate to further virulence polymorphism in <i>T. gondii</i> not expressed in the limited range of strains used in the present study. Likewise, mice are not the only intermediate hosts for <i>T. gondii</i>. The parasite infects all known mammals and birds, and many other species than <i>M. musculus</i> are prey for domestic cats. Furthermore, individuals of other species, for example rats (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jacobs and Jones, 1950</a>) and American deer mice (<i>Peromyscus</i>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Frenkel, 1953</a>) have been shown to resist infection with strains virulent for laboratory mice. Thus some of the genomic complexity of the ROP system and other virulence-associated <i>T. gondii</i> secretory proteins may be relevant to immunity modification in other host species. Nevertheless, despite these distractions, mice and <i>T. gondii</i> have clearly had a large selective impact on each other."

The impact of the dramatic narrowing of the parasite\u2019s effective host range on the genetics of the virulence-resistance relationship may help to understand better the co-evolutionary forces at work in this system. The patterns of genetic resistance against <i>T. gondii</i> in its most important intermediate hosts will determine the relative abundance of strains contaminating the environment, and thereby the strains available for human infection."

A partial synonymy relating the new nomenclature to other names that have appeared in the literature is given in <a href=\"#bib39\">Martens and Howard (2006)</a>. The root name for members of the IRG family is IRG. This may followed by single letters designating phylogenetically distinct sequence sub-families, as IRGA, IRGB, IRGC, IRGD, IRGM. Individual gene or protein names are given in the standard mouse nomenclatural form, as Irga6 (protein) and <i>Irga6</i> (gene) or Irgb6 (protein) and <i>Irgb6</i> (gene). A subset of IRGB genes consist of two adjacent IRG coding units that are transcribed together from single promoters and spliced to form \u2018tandem\u2019 IRG proteins with a molecular weight twice that of the individual IRG coding units. In the original study it was not clear whether the individual coding units could also be expressed separately and they were therefore given separate names (as Irgb1 and Irgb2) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bekpen et al., 2005</a>). It is now clear that these coding units are expressed only as tandems. In the present study we have therefore named the tandem genes and proteins with the names of their constituent coding units in N-C order, thus Irgb2-b1 is a tandem IRG protein with the Irgb2 coding unit N-terminal to the Irgb1 coding unit."

Irga6 and Irgb6 are the most highly expressed (in lab mice) and there are excellent serological reagents available for them. We therefore used Irga6 and Irgb6 for experiments that monitor loading at the vacuole. In addition, we have antisera against the specific phosphoserines on Irga6 so we can measure phosphorylation directly. Irgb6 is however more drastically affected by the genetic difference between avirulent types II and III <i>T. gondii</i> strains and virulent type I strains, dropping from up to 90% loading of vacuoles to around 10%. Irga6 is also greatly affected but the effect is seen more conspicuously as a reduction in the intensity of loading rather than in a reduction in the percent of vacuoles detectably loaded. These and other distinctive properties, are described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib32\">Khaminets et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Steinfeldt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fleckenstein et al., 2012</a>).

Cells were prepared from diaphragm tissue by a modification of the technique described by <a href=\"#bib3\">Antony et al., (1989)</a>. Diaphragm-derived cells are easy to prepare and have the advantage over MEFs that they can be prepared from a single adult mouse, enabling individual genetically different animals to be studied genetically and functionally at the cellular level. One mouse from each of BL/6, CAST/EiJ, CTP and CIM strains was sacrificed and the diaphragm removed under sterile conditions. The diaphragm was washed with PBS, chopped up, incubated with collagenase/dispase (1 mg/ml, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C and then centrifuged for 15 s at 100\u00d7<i>g</i>. The supernatant was collected, centrifuged for 5 min at 500\u00d7<i>g</i> and the pellet plated in DMEM, 10% FCS supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine, 2 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1\u00d7 MEM non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (all PAA, Pasching, Austria). The remaining cell debris after collagenase/dispase-incubation was further incubated in 1\u00d7 trypsin (Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C, and then centrifuged for 15 s at 100\u00d7<i>g</i>.

In addition, the authors provide evidence that specific <i>IRGs</i> from resistant mouse strains function by dysregulating the activity of parasite virulence factors. The experiments are well designed and conducted, and the results are properly interpreted. The authors go on to speculate that the <i>IRG</i> polymorphism in mice (and loss of the entire IRG system in several vertebrate groups) reflects a fitness trade-off. In addition, the authors acknowledge that the mouse\u2013<i>T. gondii</i> interaction is probably only a part of the evolutionary picture, and that <i>IRG</i> evolution is likely to be driven by other pathogens as well, such as Chlamydia."

This is only briefly alluded to in the Discussion, but in fact it seems relevant from the opening and should be mentioned in the Introduction already. The present work reveals the role of one component of the IRG family in combating Tg. And yet, the role of many other components remains undefined. Again, how important co-evolution with <i>T. gondii</i> is for <i>IRG</i> diversification is still unknown. Along these lines, the observation that the virulent strain GT1 can form cysts in resistant CIM mice is interesting, but not a very strong argument for co-evolution. Virulent strains of <i>T. gondii</i> can form cysts in any resistant species. In this regard, there does not seem anything particularly different about the wild mouse. It is the lab mouse that is the exception. It remains an interesting historical artefact that the extreme susceptibility of the lab mouse led to ROP kinase discovery. Along these lines, little is said about the coincidence between different <i>IRG</i> genotypes and <i>T. gondii</i> strains in the wild, which is obviously important to determine the significance of the laboratory observations."

While there is a literature with which we are familiar, and now cited, showing that individuals of other species (including man, of course) are resistant to many virulent <i>T. gondii</i> strains, the belief is general and has been reiterated for years, that mice are peculiarly vulnerable to the parasite. This generalisation has however been based on a limited database: until our own study, which is now pretty well known in the community, everybody has used classical laboratory mouse strains to examine this question. Yes, it's pretty obvious, but as said, (<b>A</b>) it can't be found in the published literature and (<b>B</b>) paradoxes are there to be resolved: this paper presents experimental data that resolve the paradox. Incidentally it is far from obvious that the laboratory strains of mouse should be so homogeneous in the <i>IRG</i> gene clusters. The MHCs of the same strains are strikingly polymorphic. Their shared vulnerability to type I Toxoplasma strains is the case simply because they have homogenised specific haplotypes of the IRG system.

The extended \u201cred\u201d domain on and adjacent to helix 4 identifies a region that appears to be under recent positive selection for a divergent sequence. This would occur, e.g., if this region of the molecule was under pressure to interact with new variants of a pathogen protein. Normally one would not expect to see this effect if Irgb2-b1 interacts with a host protein to \u201cbridge\u201d to ROP5 because the interaction surface between two host proteins would not be expected to evolve rapidly under divergent selection. We have added an additional comment on this to the text."

To be clear, however, the only Illumina-derived transcriptome data of our own (at CCG Cologne) that we present here is the CIM transcriptome from IFN\u03b3-induced DDC. The MSM BAC was sequenced by Illumina at Beijing Genomics Institute, de novo assembled then aligned to the C57BL/6 canonical genome. To test the validity of using Illumina resequencing of complete transcriptomes as a general approach for the rapid determination of unknown <i>IRG</i> haplotypes, we made an Illumina run on RNA of IFN\u03b3-induced C57BL/6 fibroblasts to compare with the canonical genomic sequence of this strain that was established by extended Sanger sequencing on shotgun genomic fragments and from BACs. The C57BL/6 haplotype on Chr 11 is peculiarly difficult because it contains 4 very recently divergent tandem Irgb genes and additionally a duplicated Irgb6 gene, the two isoforms differing by only 3 non-coding nucleotides in the ORF. The resequencing results were not only easy to align against the canonical sequence, but also acted as a welcome confirmation of the sequences of the C57BL/6 genome: it was unclear for earlier releases of the C57BL/6 genome whether indeed there was an additional duplication in the IRGB region of Chr 11. The Illumina results show beyond doubt that both the extra copy of Irgb6 and the two extra tandem Irgb genes are real. All the intact <i>IRG</i> genes were recovered in up to 12,000 fold coverage; only degraded pseudogenes were not found. A second comparison was made with the CAST/Ei sequence. In that case, the data from the Sanger mouse genome project was based on Illumina resequencing while our data was based on Sanger sequencing of shotgun genomic fragments from BACs. Again there is perfect conformity between the two sequence sets."
