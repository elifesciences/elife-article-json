Here we show that somatosensory feedback is transmitted to many sensory and motor cortical regions within 25ms of a mechanical disturbance applied to the monkey's arm. When limb feedback was salient to an ongoing motor action (task engagement), neurons in parietal area 5 immediately (~25ms) increased their response to limb disturbances, whereas neurons in other regions did not alter their response until 15 to 40ms later. In contrast, initiation of a motor action elicited by a limb disturbance (target selection) altered neural responses in primary motor cortex ~65ms after the limb disturbance, and then in dorsal premotor cortex, with no effect in parietal regions until 150ms post-perturbation. Our findings highlight broad parietofrontal circuits provide the neural substrate for goal-directed corrections, an essential aspect of highly skilled motor behaviors."
