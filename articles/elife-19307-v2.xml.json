We propagated cultures in a cyclical environment, alternating between growth up to carrying capacity and selection for chemotaxis. Initial adaptations boosted overall swimming speed at the expense of growth. The effect of the trade-off was subsequently eased through a change in behavior; while individual cells reduced motility during exponential growth, the faction of the population that was motile increased as the carrying capacity was approached. This plastic behavior was produced by a single amino acid replacement in FliA, a regulatory protein central to the chemotaxis network.

In variable environments trade-offs can be imposed consecutively, with different traits favored at different times. There are now two possible adaptive responses: (i) simultaneously optimize the traits or (ii) change the traits dynamically to match the prevailing conditions, a phenomenon called phenotypic plasticity. Theoretical models predict that, provided the genetic variation exists to generate a suitably plastic response, the second should be favored because it reduces the costs imposed by the trade-offs (<a href=\"#bib8\">De Jong, 1993</a>; King and Roff, 2010; <a href=\"#bib27\">Malausa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Murren et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Roff, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Scheiner, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">van Noordwijk and de Jong, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Worley et al., 2003</a>). For example, changes in insect wing morphology with varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and food quality, have been attributed to the trade-off between flight capability and reproduction\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Harrison, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Zera et al., 1997</a>). Wings develop fully only in stressful environments, allowing insects to escape adversity while minimizing costs to reproduction in benign environments (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harrison, 1980</a>)."

Therefore no trade-off is present. Control experiments without chemotaxis select for improved growth rates (p=0.0022, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The selective gradient (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lynch, 1998</a>)\u00a0(a measure of selective strength) along the growth axis is much steeper than along the chemotaxis axis (0.603 vs. 0.087, Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Therefore, adaptation in the early phase is dominated by chemotaxis mutations of large phenotypic effect."

In our adaptive landscape the relationships between phenotypes and fitness were defined a priori. Independent regressions from different experimental populations produce similar Pareto fronts (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), with all populations evolving close to the predicted optimum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Three patterns were evident (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>): (1) the ancestor's swimming speed increases during rapid growth and then declines as the carrying capacity is approached, (2) clones from the early and the middle periods swim faster than the ancestor nearly the whole time, the difference becoming more marked during late growth, and (3) clones that broke through the Pareto front reduce swimming speed during rapid growth and increase swimming speed as the carrying capacity is approached."

                        "text": "There are three different ways adaptation can resolve constraints caused by functional trade-offs. First, gain-of-function mutations can change the constraint itself. For example, <i>E. coli</i> can evolve the ability to use citrate as a carbon source under aerobic conditions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hall, 1982</a>), thereby eliminating a metabolic constraint. Second, adaptation can optimize traits to bring populations to an adaptive peak. Echoing previous work on adaptive landscapes where trade-offs serve as boundary conditions to provide strong predictive power (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dekel and Alon, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ibarra et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Poelwijk et al., 2011</a>), we observed that growth rate and chemotaxis were initially optimized to bring populations close to the optimum on the Pareto front. Third, in a variable environment the costs associated with a trade-off can be mitigated by a phenotypically plastic response. The unanticipated escape from the optimum illustrates how the emergence of a new behavior can reduce the costs of a trade-off to gain access to virgin regions of an adaptive landscape. Recently, another group found that a trade-off between different environments facilitated adaptation (<a href=\"#bib9\">De Vos et al., 2015</a>).This adds to our speculation that, besides phenotypic plasticity, many other adaptive novel traits have their origins in tradeoffs."

From a single colony, the ancestral strain was grown overnight at 30\u00b0C to full density and diluted 1000 times into each of five 18\u2009mm sterile glass tubes (Pyrex) containing one ml TB. The five cultures were treated the same way. They were incubated at 30\u00b0C and shaken at 250\u2009rpm. 11.5\u2009hr after inoculation, 50 \u00b5l of each culture was diluted into 250 \u00b5l of washing buffer and centrifuged at 3000\u00a0g for 3\u2009min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet gently re-suspended in 300 \u00b5l of washing buffer to minimize flagellar damage. 180 \u00b5l of the suspension was transferred to a well in a sterile 96-well microplate (BD Falcon). Having loaded all five samples, the plate was raised on one side so that it became perpendicular to the bench surface. The liquid remained inside the wells due to surface tension. A glass micro-capillary (0.8\u2009mm inner diameter \u00d7 75\u2009mm, Drummond) was heat-melted at one end to seal the opening. After cooling to room temperature, the capillary was flamed over Bunsen burner briefly and the open end immediately submerged into TB. On cooling to room temperature the capillary absorbed ~5 \u00b5l of TB. Washing buffer was pipetted to rinse off carryover medium on the outer surface of the capillary. The open end was submerged into the liquid in the well and the whole system was incubated at 30\u00b0C for chemotactic competition to occur. After 30\u2009min, the capillary was removed and rinsed with washing buffer to remove cells on the outer wall. To initiate the next cycle of growth and chemotaxis, the liquid and cells in the capillary were pushed into a glass tube of 1\u2009ml of fresh TB medium by flaming the capillary briefly. This cycle of growth and chemotaxis was repeated 150 times (11 weeks). Each week 1\u2009ml of culture was taken from each tube and diluted with 80% sterile glycerol to the final glycerol concentration of 16%. The diluted cultures were stored at \u221280\u00b0C as archives. For each archived culture, 6 single strains were randomly picked from single colonies streaked on agar plate. Each strain was characterized for growth rate and chemotactic ability."

The manuscript started with a model prediction on how bacteria exposed to fluctuating environment and selection (selecting for growth following by selecting for chemotaxis) should evolve. Indeed, such prediction was shown to hold for early stage of evolution where cells initially evolved to be better at both growth and chemotaxis (my interpretation here differs somewhat from that of authors) and at phase 2 evolved along a Pareto front as cells evolved to be slower grower and faster swimmer. At phase 3 (P3), a single mutation in fliA allowed cells to break this tradeoff. <i>fliA</i> mutant lowered swimming speed during exponential growth when chemotaxis is not selected for, and increased swimming speed and fraction of motile cells at high cell density. The results are interesting. However, major issued will need to be addressed before acceptance."

If you have two populations of say 6 individuals, one with and one without a fast-growing individual, statistically speaking the two populations are the same. But the population with fast-growing individual will quickly deviate from the population without fast-growing individual. Why not just plot all six clones that you quantified, each with an error bar for measurement? My interpretation is that some clones must have significantly improved growth rate to generate the data of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. This will also make later statements (i.e. decrease in growth rate) more sensible, since most clones in later stages do not seem to have smaller growth rate than the ancestor."

Some general aspects of the process have been recognized in a qualitative manner, but this study provides interesting quantitative evidence on the evolutionary trajectory followed by populations of <i>E. coli</i> subjected to alternating selection for rapid growth and chemotaxis. They used serial transfer of innocula from populations that increased from a lag phase, through an exponential growth phase, to stationary phase which they simply called \"growth rate\". The transfer was carried out by allowing cells to swim into a capillary for 30 minutes before being deposited in fresh medium. The efficiency of transfer was considered a measure of \"chemotaxis\" and they directly showed swimming speed, measured from video micrographs, correlated with the number of bacteria that entered into the capillaries."

During the next few weeks chemotaxis stayed high and the growth rate improved until it exceeded that of the original population. This is a classical sequential adaptation of traits overcoming a trade-off where initially the rate of swimming increased but the energy expended in rapid swimming limited the growth rate; further evolution resulted in reduced rate of swimming in exponentially growing cells with a return to rapid swimming just before they were presented with a capillary for transfer. The growth rate of these more highly evolved populations exceeded that of the original population. These results are clearly and thoroughly presented."

At week 7 they found mutations in the upstream region of the gene encoding the enzyme that synthesizes c-di-GMP (yegE) and in the gene encoding the c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (yahA). The level of c-di-GMP was much reduced in low density cultures of these cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This may account for the increase in chemotaxis of these cells since c-di-GMP is a signal that negatively modulates flagellar activity. There were 3 other mutations in the population but they were not analyzed and may have been irrelevant. It would be interesting to know if these same mutations were found in the other 4 populations carried through the selection. Genes that were hit two or more times are likely to be pertinent to the increase in fitness. The mutation in yahA appears to increase the level of phosphodiesterase and so is likely to be a gain-of-function dominant mutation. The authors should consider establishing this point."

First, <i>E. coli</i>'s swimming speed depends on pH of the medium because its flagellar motor is powered by protons. However, for unbuffered rich medium, such as LB, which is similar to tryptone broth, the pH reaches 9 after 1day of growth (J. Bacteriol. December 2007, vol. 189, 8746-8749).

For example, I can imagine two different scenarios for evolution to escape a trade-off: (a) a trade-off exists because of a true genetic constraint, and the population eventually evolves to change that constraint, allowing new phenotypes to evolve that are no longer constrained in the original way; (b) an apparent trade-off exists because all common variation/mutations obey the trade-off, but rare mutations sometimes violate the trade-off. My sense is that the latter is operating in this paper, because the R220W mutation is stated to function in a wild-type background the same as it does in the background in which it evolved. Thus (I imagine), the mutation would have been favored initially had it arisen then. (But maybe it would only have been favored in the new background?)"

This may account for the increase in chemotaxis of these cells since c-di-GMP is a signal that negatively modulates flagellar activity. There were 3 other mutations in the population but they were not analyzed and may have been irrelevant. It would be interesting to know if these same mutations were found in the other 4 populations carried through the selection. Genes that were hit two or more times are likely to be pertinent to the increase in fitness. The mutation in yahA appears to increase the level of phosphodiesterase and so is likely to be a gain-of-function dominant mutation. The authors should consider establishing this point.</i>"

My sense is that the latter is operating in this paper, because the R220W mutation is stated to function in a wild-type background the same as it does in the background in which it evolved.

The two of us have been all at sixes and sevens about behavior, plasticity and trade-offs, genetic, biochemical, apparent and real. We think the trade-off between energy for growth and energy for motility is hard wired and cannot be modified (energy for growth and for motility is pulled from the same pool). This is a physical constraint (the conservation of energy and matter) rather than a genetic constraint that might otherwise change. The trade-off is real rather than apparent.

The paper argues up front that the physiological basis of the trade-off is energy, but how is the energetic equivalence between chemotaxis and growth calculated \u2013 in the context of this selection? (It might make more sense to use standard notation such as delta for the incremental difference of the mutant from wild-type.) And perhaps a related point is that I do not understand why the logistic growth is (apparently) claimed to reduce selection for faster growth once the population has evolved to the point that it saturates in 11.5 hours \u2013 isn't there still selection for even faster growth, because any faster mutant will overtake the others? I'm clearly not following things here.</i>"

If, say, we grow the population for only 5 hours instead of 11.5, and impose capillary selection when the cells are still in mid-log phase, then the adaptive landscape would be a flat plane. Mapping the empirical Pareto front (a straight line) onto this plane can't produce an optimum. Allowing cells to grow into late-log or early stationary phase causes a reduction in growth rates. As explained in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, with faster grow rates populations approach carrying capacity sooner. By the time capillary selection is imposed, a population with a large growth rate will be very close to carrying capacity. Further increases the growth rate will not produce much of an increase in population size. The effect of diminishing returns due to logistic growth produces curvature in the adaptive landscape."
