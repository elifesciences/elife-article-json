As Gag assembles on the plasma membrane, the HIV-1 genome is enriched relative to cellular RNAs by an unknown mechanism. We used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag and giant unilamellar vesicles to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5\u2019 untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. Mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag which subtly affect the self-assembly of Gag abrogated RNA selectivity. We further found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are thus interdependent on one another."

As Gag assembles on the plasma membrane, the HIV-1 genome is enriched relative to cellular RNAs by an unknown mechanism. We used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag and giant unilamellar vesicles to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5\u2019 untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. Mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag which subtly affect the self-assembly of Gag abrogated RNA selectivity. We further found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are thus interdependent on one another."

Disturbing the immature lattice by altering the Gag proteins can result in a drastic loss of RNA selectivity. Further experiments show that other molecules in host cells called transfer RNAs enhance the ability of Gag to select the RNAs that encode virus genes."

In the case of HIV-1, both the recognition of the genomic RNA, its targeting to the plasma membrane, and assembly of a membrane-enveloped virus around it is carried out by the viral protein Gag (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rein et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sundquist and Kr\u00e4usslich, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Freed, 2015</a>). The nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag has two zinc knuckle motifs which together with adjacent residues interact with the viral RNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berkowitz et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lu et al., 2011b</a>). Mutations in NC that interfere with RNA binding lead to formation of\u00a0non-infectious viruses (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aldovini and Young, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gorelick et al., 1990</a>). Transcription of the integrated HIV-1 provirus results in both spliced and unspliced transcripts, coding for different viral proteins (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coffin et al., 1997</a>). Gag selectively packages unspliced, full-length genomic RNA through interactions with its 5\u2019 untranslated region (5\u2019UTR), which is different in spliced and unspliced constructs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lu et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kuzembayeva et al., 2014</a>). In addition to sequences that mediate the packaging of the genomic RNA, the 5\u2019UTR also has sequence elements related to transcription processivity (TAR), binding of tRNA<sup>Lys-3</sup> as a\u00a0primer for reverse transcription (PBS), and genome dimerization (DIS) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson and Telesnitsky, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lu et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kuzembayeva et al., 2014</a>)."

The packaging of a single dimeric genome is independent of RNA mass, since genomes with altered lengths are always packaged as single dimers (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nikolaitchik et al., 2013</a>). Genomic RNAs with sequence differences are efficiently packaged as heterodimers as long as they have identical DIS sequences (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2009</a>). The \u03c8/SL3 stem loop region in the 5\u2019UTR was initially identified as a sequence required for efficient packaging of genomic RNA into HIV-1 virions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lever et al., 1989</a>). Later work characterized a more extended core encapsidation signal (CES) which also includes the U5:AUG and PBS stems, the dimerization signal (DIS) and the splice donor (SD) region (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heng et al., 2012</a>). Unpaired and weakly paired guanosines in several regions of the CES, including but not limited to \u03c8/SL3 were identified as important for packaging (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abd El-Wahab et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Keane et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kenyon et al., 2015</a>).

A crystal structure of the DIS:DIS dimerization complex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ennifar et al., 2001</a>) along with an NMR structure of the entire CES (<a href=\"#bib31\">Keane et al., 2015</a>) put these structures in the context of a larger RNA.

Indeed, cross-linking-immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) revealed a strikingly different RNA preference of cytosolic and membrane-bound Gag (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kutluay et al., 2014</a>). Cytosolic Gag binds tRNA through its otherwise membrane-binding matrix (MA) domain, and associates mainly with cellular RNAs through its NC domain. The minor fraction of cytosolic Gag which binds viral RNA has a strong preference for the 5\u2019UTR but also binds to the Rev-responsive element (RRE), whose main function is thought to be in nuclear export (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kuzembayeva et al., 2014</a>). On the other hand, Gag in the membrane fraction has lost its tRNA association and is strongly enriched for viral RNA, interacting with equal probability with all parts of the genomic RNA. Existing structural and biochemical data are not sufficient to explain how a pool of cytosolic Gag, binding mainly cellular RNA, assembles into virus particles which package dimeric viral genomes with 90% probability."

Gag assembling on GUV membranes selectively packages the HIV-1 5\u2019UTR at subnanomolar concentrations in the presence of excess competitor RNA. We find that the RNA selectivity of Gag is abolished by mutations that subtly affect its ability to cluster on a membrane. Using SHAPE analysis, we find that membrane recruitment of the 5\u2019UTR by Gag does not lead to drastic changes in its secondary structure, and we further demonstrate that the association of soluble Gag with tRNA confers additional RNA packaging selectivity."

We showed that GUV-bound Gag clusters mimic the behavior of cellular HIV-1 budding sites in their lipid requirements for assembly, nucleic acid- and ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) protein binding. We reasoned that this system could also be used to study the RNA selection of an assembling HIV-1 virus. The 5\u2019 untranslated region (5\u2019UTR) and the Rev-responsive element (RRE) of the HIV-1 genome (nucleotides 1\u2013345 and 7259\u20137612, of the genomic RNA of HIV-1 strain NL4-3 and ARV-2/SF2, respectively), along with a nominally unstructured 378 nt single-stranded control RNA (RNA378), were produced by in vitro transcription. The 1\u2013345 construct was previously shown to dimerize even in the absence of Gag (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heng et al., 2012</a>). RNAs were labeled with the fluorophore Alexa488 on random guanosines, at measured average labeling efficiencies of ~1.1\u20131.2 fluorophores per RNA molecule. 100 nM Gag-ATTO594 was premixed with 0.5 nM fluorescent RNA, and added to GUVs which were imaged by confocal microscopy starting 10 min after addition of protein and RNA.

This RNA recruitment was dependent on the NC domain of Gag since neither a \u0394NC Gag nor Gag treated with the Zn-finger disrupting drug AT-2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rossio et al., 1998</a>) was able to recruit fluorescent RNA to GUV membranes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To study the RNA selectivity of assembling Gag in the reconstituted system, we included a ten\u00a0fold excess (5 nM) of non-fluorescent RNA378 when premixing RNA and Gag. After assembly on GUVs, the fluorescent 5\u2019UTR was still visible at most Gag clusters in the presence of ten\u00a0fold excess competitor RNA, whereas RRE was present at fewer Gag clusters and at lower fluorescence intensities, and fluorescent RNA378 was virtually absent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d\u2013f,g</a>).

This set of mutations was previously found to reduce packaging in a cellular packaging assay (<a href=\"#bib31\">Keane et al., 2015</a>). 5\u2019UTR mono has the GCGCGC sequence in DIS replaced by GAGA, creating a monomeric 5\u2019UTR. 5\u2019UTR 3way1-mono combines the 3way1 and mono mutations. Lastly, 5\u2019UTR env-1 represents the first 345 nt of a spliced viral RNA, with the nucleotides after splice donor site G290 replaced by the nucleotides after splice acceptor site A5 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stoltzfus, 2009</a>). In a competition assay similar to the one reported in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, 100 nM Gag-ATTO594 was premixed with 0.5 nM 5\u2019UTR-Alexa488 and 5 nM of either non-fluorescent 5\u2019UTR construct, and added to GUVs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013f</a>). In the presence of 5 nM 5\u2019UTR very little fluorescent 5\u2019UTR could be seen at Gag clusters on GUVs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,g</a>). However, in the presence of either of the altered constructs, more fluorescent 5\u2019UTR was visible at Gag clusters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013f,g</a>). Thus, the in vitro packaging assay is able to detect the lower affinity of assembling Gag for monomeric, 3way1-mutated, and spliced 5\u2019UTRs."

The 5\u2019UTR is strongly selected for in a competition assay, whereas the RRE is only partially selected for after addition of competitor. 5\u2019UTRs that are either monomerized, have packaging-critical guanines mutated to adenines, or represent a spliced viral RNA are less favored in the competition assay. Given the low concentrations at which this selectivity is observed, below the reported 17 nM affinity constant for 5\u2019UTR-NC association (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heng et al., 2012</a>), we turned our attention to potential avidity effects due to Gag multimerization."

To this end, we produced Gag proteins mutated at symmetry contacts in its lattice-forming CA domain. The W316D,M317D mutation (\"Gag two-fold\") alters a motif at the two\u00a0fold symmetry contact in the CA C-terminal domain (CA-CTD), which is described in the\u00a0literature to be important for virus assembly (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gamble et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">von Schwedler et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a\u2013b</a>). When this protein was added to GUVs at 100 nM, it bound in a strikingly different way from wild-type Gag, often resulting in a diffuse Gag fluorescence covering the entire GUV membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f,g</a>). For comparison, wild type Gag essentially only bound to GUVs in clusters even in the absence of RNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e,g</a>). Based on the structure of the immature CA lattice in intact HIV-1 virions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schur et al., 2015</a>), we further produced a triple mutant (\"Gag three-fold\": P170E, A174E, E177R) designed to alter a three-helix interaction at the three\u00a0fold interface in CA-NTD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,c</a>). This protein bound GUVs similarly to wild-type Gag, albeit with a moderate increase in the diffuse binding first observed for Gag two-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>). A Gag protein mutated at the six\u00a0fold interface in CA-CTD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,d</a>) with the single-residue replacement K290A (\"Gag six-fold\") reported to affect virus assembly (<a href=\"#bib50\">von Schwedler et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Robinson et al., 2014</a>), also showed an increase in diffuse Gag binding over wild-type Gag (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>). Combining the two-,\u00a0three-, and six-fold mutations in one protein (\"Gag 2-,3-,6-fold\") resulted in an assembly phenotype similar to that of Gag two-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>). Taken together, mutations in the CA-CTD of either the W316,M317 motif at the two-fold symmetry contact, or of K290 at the six-fold symmetry contact, both described as leading to virus release defects (<a href=\"#bib50\">von Schwedler et al., 2003</a>), affect the ability of Gag to cluster on membranes."

We first compared the membrane binding of Gag proteins in the presence of RNA to Gag proteins alone as characterized above. We observed that the presence of RNA increased the clustering of all Gag proteins, and increased the fraction of GUVs which had bound Gag (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013j</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). First, the capacity of the Gag proteins to recruit fluorescent RNA in the absence of competitor was studied. Each Gag construct was premixed with 0.5 nM fluorescent 5\u2019UTR and added to GUVs. Recruitment of fluorescent 5\u2019UTR to the GUV membrane was observed for all Gag constructs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013e</a>), with a quantitation showing a slight decrease in recruitment for the Gag two-fold and Gag two-, three- , six-fold mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4k</a>). However, when a ten\u00a0fold excess of non-fluorescent competitor RNA (5 nM RNA378) was added, the Gag proteins behaved differently from each other. Wild type Gag retained as much 5\u2019UTR fluorescence in the presence of competitor RNA as in its absence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f,k</a>) and the Gag three-fold mutant showed only a minor decrease (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h,k</a>). On the other hand, GUV-bound clusters of the Gag two-fold, Gag six-fold and Gag two-,\u00a0three-,\u00a0six-fold mutants lost most of their 5\u2019UTR fluorescence in the presence of competitor RNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g,i\u2013k</a>). Thus, RNA selectivity in this assay closely correlates with clustered binding of Gag to GUVs in the absence of RNA (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3g</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4k</a>). In summary, mutations which cause subtle changes in the ability of Gag to multimerize on a membrane drastically decrease the RNA selectivity of assembled Gag clusters, without greatly affecting their ability to bind RNA non-specifically."

First, we examined the SHAPE profile of the 5\u2019UTR RNA in solution by itself. The RNA-only SHAPE profile is highly consistent with the recently reported solution structure of the HIV-1 RNA packaging signal (<a href=\"#bib31\">Keane et al., 2015</a>), with the tandem three-way junctions exhibiting modest SHAPE reactivities, reflecting the loosely base-paired nature of this region. On the other hand, well based-paired stem regions in the DIS, PBS, U5:AUG, and \u03c8/SL3 sequences exhibit low or no SHAPE reactivities (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). The dimer-promoting DIS loop (G257-C262) had no SHAPE reactivity. This is not per se an unequivocal indication of the 5\u2019 UTR being dimeric since DIS has been reported to partially base-pair with U5 in the monomeric conformation of the 5\u2019UTR (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lu et al., 2011a</a>). However, the SHAPE reactivity of the SD region G289-G292 (highlighted with a gray shaded box in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>) is consistent with the reported 3D structure of the dimeric conformation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Keane et al., 2015</a>), not with the completely unprotected loop proposed for the monomeric 5\u2019UTR (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lu et al., 2011a</a>). A longer 356 nt 5\u2019UTR able to assume both monomer- and a dimer-favoring conformations (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heng et al., 2012</a>) had a similar SHAPE reactivity to the 345 nt 5\u2019UTR (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>), indicating that it is present mainly as a dimer under the conditions of the study. We next compared the SHAPE profiles of isolated RNA, and RNA in complexes mimicking steps in the genome packaging. Isolated NC domain was selected to represent the initial interaction of a single Gag molecule with the 5\u2019UTR, \u0394MA(1\u2013119)-Gag for a potential soluble Gag-RNA complex involving CA-mediated Gag-Gag interactions, and Gag clusters on GUVs as a model of viral budding sites on the plasma membrane. In all measurements, protein was kept in excess (solution protein:RNA ratio 8:1, GUV protein:RNA ratio 20:1). For a\u00a0SHAPE analysis on GUV-bound RNA, reactions were set up as for confocal imaging, and GUVs were found to be intact during the treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The amount of free RNA in the GUV supernatant was typically 10\u201320% of the total RNA, dependent on the presence of both GUVs and Gag. The SHAPE profiles for 5\u2019UTR were very similar in the presence of NC, \u0394MA-Gag, and when bound to Gag clusters on GUVs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Upon Gag binding, major SHAPE changes were observed in the following clusters: U117-U122, G234-A242, A271-G273, and A302-G309 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). Among them, the two clusters exhibiting decreased SHAPE reactivity (G234-C242 and A271-G273) surround the two guanine-rich bulges on the DIS stem. This Gag-mediated decrease of RNA flexibility is consistent with, but does not necessarily reflect, direct Gag-RNA contacts (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kenyon et al., 2015</a>). These clusters show a more pronounced decrease in SHAPE reactivity than the \u03c8 loop G317-G320. The other two clusters showing major SHAPE reactivity changes, U117-U122 and A302-G309, are located around the tandem three-way junctions. Both regions exhibit higher SHAPE reactivities upon Gag binding, indicating that protein interactions lead to rearrangement of the local structure that results in higher RNA flexibility. However, GUV recruitment of the complex did not trigger additional SHAPE changes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the overall structure of the 5\u2019UTR is not further altered between the states of initial Gag binding in solution and recruitment to assembled Gag on a membrane. Noteworthy, the SHAPE reactivity of the SD region G289-G292 is similar under all conditions studied (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a,c</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the 5\u2019UTR is maintained in the dimeric conformation over the assembly process. Taken together, we see no evidence for large changes in secondary structures in the 5\u2019UTR when interacting with either Gag in solution or assembled Gag on a membrane, and it appears dimeric under the conditions studied."

Several reports have shown that RNA binding to the basic patch on the MA domain of HIV-1 Gag can compete with its ability to bind acidic phospholipids such as PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Alfadhli et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chukkapalli et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dick et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dick and Vogt, 2014</a>). We wanted to investigate whether Gag-tRNA interactions also play a role in selective RNA packaging. Premixing 100 nM Gag-ATTO594 with 1 \u00b5M yeast tRNA before addition to GUVs led to a virtually complete block in Gag assembly on GUVs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a\u2013b</a>). Since the amount of Gag on individual GUVs is more variable than the relative RNA fluorescence at Gag clusters, a membrane flotation assay was devised to quantitate the amount of Gag assembled on membranes. 100 nM Gag-ATTO488 was mixed with 0\u201320 \u00b5M tRNA, and incubated for 10 min with 1.0 \u00b5m large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing 5\u2009mol% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Vesicles were subjected to flotation on a density step gradient and Gag fluorescence in the top fraction was measured. For the tRNA titration, a 50% inhibition of Gag membrane association was evident at 200 nM tRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). At 20 \u00b5M tRNA, the amount of Gag found in the vesicle fraction dropped to ~10% of the value seen in the absence of RNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). Next, long viral or unspecific RNAs at 5 nM concentration were added to Gag with or without tRNA. In addition to the above studied 5\u2019UTR, RRE, and RNA378, an RNA corresponding to the first 1947 nucleotides of the HIV-1 strain NL4-3 genomic RNA was studied (HIV1947), along with a single-stranded control RNA of similar length (RNA2266). In the absence of tRNA, all these RNAs slightly increased the amount of Gag associated with vesicles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). In the presence of 20 \u00b5M tRNA however, the 5\u2019UTR and the longer HIV1947 RNA (which contains the 5\u2019UTR sequence) enhanced membrane association by Gag more than the other RNAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>). RNA378 had no effect on Gag membrane association in the presence of 20 \u00b5M tRNA, whereas the effect of RRE or the longer RNA2266 was slight (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>). In summary, tRNA at micromolar concentrations potently inhibits membrane association of Gag. Under such conditions, Gag that encounters viral RNA has a higher probability of overcoming that inhibition and associating with membrane."

We find a strong correlation between the ability of Gag to multimerize on a membrane and its selective packaging of viral RNA. Mutations in the lattice-forming CA domain that lessen Gag clustering on membranes (W316D,M317D and K290A, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,d,f,g</a>) drastically lowered its RNA selectivity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g,i,k</a>), without affecting the total capacity of Gag to recruit RNA to a membrane (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b,d,k</a>). Mutations of these residues in the C-terminal part of CA (CA-CTD) have previously been described to lead to virus release defects related to aberrant virus assembly (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gamble et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">von Schwedler et al., 2003</a>). In line with our findings, it has been reported that the amount of viral RNA coprecipitated with cytoplasmic Gag is reduced five\u00a0fold when its CA-CTD is deleted, whereas the amount of cellular RNA coprecipitated remains the same (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kutluay and Bieniasz, 2010</a>). On the other hand, in experiments which did not address selectivity, a \u0394CA-CTD Gag was still able to tether genomic RNA to the plasma membrane in cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jouvenet et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sardo et al., 2015</a>), which is consistent with our finding that the mutant Gag proteins can still recruit 5\u2019UTR although being less selective in the presence of competitors. Mutations at the three-fold symmetry contact in CA-NTD did not alter Gag clustering on membranes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>), concurring with observations that a \u0394CA-NTD Gag still supports particle release (<a href=\"#bib9\">Borsetti et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Accola et al., 2000</a>)."

A small fraction of cytosolic Gag is found to be slowly diffusing and consist of oligomers of up to ~5 molecules (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hendrix et al., 2015</a>). In a recent study, TIRF microscopy was used to study the monomer-dimer state of genomic HIV-1 RNAs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2016</a>). It was reported that the large majority of plasma membrane-proximal genomic HIV-1 RNAs are monomeric in the absence of HIV-1 Gag. In cells expressing Gag, monomeric genomic RNAs are seen to coalesce to dimers on the membrane, but were not\u00a0observed to arrive to the membrane as dimers. That study and our results underscore the importance of membrane-localized Gag assembly events in HIV-1 genome selection and packaging."

When comparing SHAPE reactivities of isolated 5\u2019UTR, 5\u2019UTR interacting with NC domain in solution, \u0394MA-Gag in solution, or recruited to GUV membranes by clusters of full-length Gag, the changes in SHAPE reactivities were consistent with a conservation of secondary structure between all these states. Based on these results, there is no gross unfolding of the dimeric 5\u2019UTR in the early steps of genomic RNA selection and packaging for HIV-1. This contrasts with reports that the packaging signal of the related retrovirus Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) is partially unfolded in released immature virions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Grohman et al., 2014</a>). The SHAPE reactivity pattern indicated that the 5\u2019UTR was, as expected, dimeric in solution. This was observed both with the shorter 345 nt 5\u2019UTR, which has been reported to be locked in a dimer-favoring conformation, and the longer 356 nt 5\u2019UTR which is also capable of assuming a second conformation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lu et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Heng et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the light of a recent report that most genomic HIV-1 RNAs in cells are monomeric until interacting with Gag on a membrane (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2016</a>), the isolated 5\u2019UTR would thus be representative of the genome after engagement with Gag. It is possible that the RNA chaperone activity of Gag may be necessary to expose the 5\u2019UTR and its DIS in the context of a full-length genome. The strongest decrease in SHAPE reactivity upon Gag interaction was found in the guanosine-rich bulges on the DIS stem (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), consistent with a recent study using full-length Gag in solution (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abd El-Wahab et al., 2014</a>). The increased SHAPE reactivity in central regions of the tandem three-way junction suggests that Gag engagement, while not leading to a drastic rearrangement of the 5\u2019UTR secondary structure, may lead to alterations its 3D structure. Overall, our results show that RNA conformational changes upon binding to membrane-associated Gag are minor in magnitude and thus suggest that conformation rearrangements are likely to be a minor contributor to selective packaging."

Our reconstituted system allowed us to disentangle the effect that different RNAs have on Gag membrane association (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We show that Gag-tRNA interactions may also serve to increase Gag fidelity for viral RNA. In the absence of tRNA, any long RNA caused a slight increase in Gag membrane association. But in the presence of 20 \u00b5M tRNA, 5\u2019UTR and a longer 1947 nt fragment of the HIV-1 genome increased Gag membrane association more than other RNAs. We hypothesize that a viral RNA with several high-affinity binding sites for Gag can recruit several Gag molecules to the membrane if only one of them dissociates from its membrane-occluding tRNA."

Attractive features of the system include: 1) dependence upon the 5'UTR core packaging site, 2) a requirement for immature Gag assembly, and 3) tRNA inhibition of Gag-membrane interactions that is specifically overcome by RNAs that contain the HIV-1 5'UTR. In addition to describing the system, the authors point out that their study is the first to show that the structure of the dimeric RNA does not change significantly during the different steps of packaging, as evidenced by a relative lack of SHAPE reactivity changes. This report marks the next progression in the excellent studies from the Hurley lab in which they have reconstituted different stages of HIV-1 assembly in vitro."

Specifically, recent studies from other laboratories support a model in which HIV RNA packaging occurs through a stepwise pathway in which the viral RNA begins in a translatable conformation (Gag AUG codon exposed), converts into a dimerizing conformation (Gag AUG codon sequestered, DIS element exposed), interacts specifically with a small number of Gag molecules that bind guanosine clusters in the 5'UTR, and then interacts with a much larger number of Gag molecules along its entire length as the immature virion lattice assemblies at the membrane. Unspliced, dimeric RNA is selectively packaged against a background of cellular RNAs, spliced RNAs, and monomeric RNAs. Thus far, the in vitro system has been shown to recapitulate some, but not all of these features."

We let these RNAs compete with fluorescent wild type 5'UTR for recruitment to Gag clusters on GUVs, and could measure that all of the mutant RNAs are weaker competitors than the wild type 5'UTR.

The membrane is important in our model system as the platform on which all of the Gag assembly occurs, consistent with the accepted notion in the HIV field that the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice only assembles when Gag interacts with a membrane. The focus of HIV-1 budding research by our team is directed at reconstituting the most realistic possible in vitro model system for HIV-1 particle biogenesis and release, and this clearly requires the inclusion of membrane. It is possible to construct in vitro systems that assemble virus-like particles in the absence of membranes, notably the p6-deleted version of Gag studied by Rein and co-workers. It seems plausible to us that the system characterized by Rein might be able to selectively package RNA even in the absence of membranes, because that system is optimized for membrane-free assembly. Experimental tests of this seem to us to be far beyond the scope of this study and of our research program."
