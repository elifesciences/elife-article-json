This process, known as transcription, creates an intermediate RNA molecule that is turned into protein in the second step. RNA polymerase is an enzyme that carries out transcription; it separates the two strands of the DNA helix so that the RNA can be synthesized from the DNA template. By opening up the DNA downstream of where active copying is taking place, and re-annealing it upstream, RNA polymerase maintains a structure called a \"transcription bubble\". RNA polymerases do not copy continuously but oscillate back and forth along the DNA. Sometimes larger backwards oscillations, known as backtracking, temporarily block the production of the RNA molecule and slow down the transcription process."

A transcription bubble resembles an opening in a zipper with two sliders; and rather than affecting the synthesis of RNA, NusG affected the part that corresponds to the \u201cslider\u201d located at the rear edge of the bubble. NusG helped this slider-like element to bring the DNA strands at this edge of the bubble back together and modified it so that it behaved as a ratchet that inhibited RNA polymerase from backtracking.

Much of transcription regulation in all domains of life takes place at the initiation stage by modulating activities of promoters. The examples of on/off regulation at the transcript elongation stage, such as promoter-proximal pauses in metazoans (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adelman and Lis, 2012</a>) and antitermination in prokaryotes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Santangelo and Artsimovitch, 2011</a>), are also known. In other cases, transcription elongation control is mediated by coupling of transcription to downstream processes, such as RNA translation, processing, and folding (<a href=\"#bib59\">Proshkin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bubunenko et al., 2013</a>). The multisubunit RNAPs evolved to elongate relatively inefficiently in the absence of proper coupling, thereby enabling the downstream processes to control the elongation rate. The ubiquitous family of NusG proteins (SPT5/SPT4 in archaea and yeast, DSIF in mammals) are the central components which mediate coupling between transcription and the downstream processes (<a href=\"#bib75\">Werner, 2012</a>)."

The N-terminal domain (NTD or NGN) anchors NusG to the clamp helices of the RNAP \u03b2\u2019 subunit, whereas the C-terminal domain (CTD or KOW) interacts with the components of the downstream processes (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib11\">Belogurov and Artsimovitch, 2015</a>]). In <i>E. coli</i>, NusG CTD interacts with NusE as part of the ribosome on protein coding operons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Burmann et al., 2010</a>) or as a part of a so-called antitermination complex (NusABEG) on ribosomal RNA operons (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zellars and Squires, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shankar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2016</a>); in these contexts, NusG inhibits the function of a transcription termination factor Rho. If neither ribosome nor antitermination complex is engaged, which often implies that transcription is futile, NusG CTD binds to Rho and facilitates termination of transcription (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cardinale et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Peters et al., 2012</a>). tRNA and other non-coding RNA genes escape the premature termination by Rho possibly due to their extensive secondary structures and small size relative to the transcribed region required for the termination of transcription by Rho (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mooney et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Peters et al., 2009</a>). NusG-mediated coupling of transcription with the pioneer round of translation is likely conserved in prokaryotes, whereas functioning of NusG CTD (and additional KOW domains present in eukaryotic SPT5 and DSIF) in RNA processing/maturation is likely conserved in all domains of life (<a href=\"#bib11\">Belogurov and Artsimovitch, 2015</a>)."

Even the housekeeping NusG may exhibit opposite effects on transcription in vivo depending on the protein partner(s) bound to its CTD domain. Furthermore, NusG from different bacteria display seemingly opposite effects on transcription by their cognate RNAPs in a purified in vitro system lacking the downstream components. The <i>E. coli</i> NusG has an intrinsic stimulatory effect on transcript elongation in vitro (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bar-Nahum et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Burova et al., 1995</a>), which persists when an isolated NusG NTD is used (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mooney et al., 2009b</a>). It is hypothesized that this intrinsic stimulatory effect of NusG NTD may allow RNAP to transcribe more efficiently in vivo when coupled with the downstream processes and slower if the coupling is broken (<a href=\"#bib47\">McGary and Nudler, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Belogurov and Artsimovitch, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Burmann and R\u00f6sch, 2011</a>). However, NusG from <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> slows down its cognate RNAP in vitro (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sevostyanova and Artsimovitch, 2010</a>), whereas <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> NusG stimulates pausing by interacting with specific sequences in the non-template DNA (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yakhnin et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib76\">2016</a>). We later suggest that these apparent incongruences result from the\u00a0superimposition of several distinct consequences of the NusG NTD binding to the RNAP and considerable differences in the elongation properties of these RNAPs.

The processive repetition of this cycle is sometimes interrupted by off-pathway pause events. The latter can be classified into pauses involving backtracking of the RNAP on the DNA template by two or more registers, which occludes the active site with the nascent RNA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Komissarova and Kashlev, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nudler et al., 1997</a>), and diverse non-backtracked pauses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000</a>). The non-backtracked pauses involve more complex and less understood rearrangement of the active site and the RNAP structure that impede the nucleotide addition (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hein et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kireeva and Kashlev, 2009</a>).

On the other hand, <i>E. coli</i> NusG mainly reduces the frequency and duration of backtracked pauses (<a href=\"#bib30\">Herbert et al., 2010</a>) that are not explicitly known to involve the \u03b2\u2019 clamp opening (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sekine et al., 2015</a>) and has only small stimulatory effect at non-backtracked pauses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Belogurov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kolb et al., 2014</a>)."

Our results suggest that NusG slows backtracking without affecting the on-pathway elongation in non-paused TECs. We also demonstrate that NusG inhibits backtracking by restricting the melting of the upstream DNA, independently of the NusG-RNAP contacts that are important for stabilization of the \u03b2\u2019 clamp conformation. We further perform a comprehensive mapping of the upstream fork junction, determine the point of the upstream DNA reannealing, and provide a plausible mechanistic model of the anti-backtracking action of NusG."

                                "text": "To determine the effect of NusG on the kinetics of nucleotide addition and translocation, we utilized a TEC design that was extensively validated in our previous studies (<a href=\"#bib45\">Malinen et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2015</a>). The TEC was assembled on a synthetic nucleic acid scaffold and contained the fully complementary transcription bubble flanked by 20-nucleotide DNA duplexes upstream and downstream (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The annealing region of a 16-nucleotide RNA primer was initially nine nucleotides, permitting the TEC extended by one nucleotide to adopt the post- and pre-translocated states, but disfavoring backtracking. The RNA primer was 5\u2019 labeled with the infrared fluorophore ATTO680 to monitor the RNA extension by the denaturing PAGE. We performed parallel, time-resolved measurements of nucleotide incorporation by assembled TEC accompanied by forward translocation and, in a separate experiment, pyrophosphorolysis of extended TEC accompanied by backward translocation in the presence and absence of saturating concentration of NusG (2 \u00b5M, see later) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). RNA extension was monitored by a rapid chemical quench-flow method, whereas forward and backward translocation were monitored by measuring the fluorescence of the 6-methyl-isoxanthopterin base (6-MI) incorporated in the template DNA strand in a stopped-flow instrument (<a href=\"#bib44\">Malinen et al., 2015</a>). NusG did not affect either of these on-pathway reactions. We then tested the effect of NusG on the TEC translocation bias in the equilibrium setup (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We have previously demonstrated that the predominantly post-translocated TEC can be converted into the pre-translocated state by tagetitoxin (TGT) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Malinen et al., 2012</a>). TGT was equally potent in biasing the TEC towards the pre-translocated state in the presence and absence of NusG, suggesting that NusG does not affect the equilibrium between the post- and pre-translocated states. Overall, these experiments suggest that NusG does not measurably affect the on-pathway kinetics and thermodynamics of transcript elongation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) in the non-paused TECs examined in this study."

We developed a system where backtracking of the TEC is driven by the rapid cleavage of the nascent RNA by the RNAP active site. The reaction was initiated by adding 2\u20138 \u00b5M GreA protein that transforms the RNAP active site into a highly efficient RNAse. The TECs were assembled on a synthetic nucleic acid scaffold and contained the fully complementary transcription bubble (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The annealing region of 18-nucleotide long RNA primer was 11 nucleotides, allowing the TEC to backtrack by one nucleotide. The RNA primer was 5\u2019 labeled with ATTO680 to monitor the accumulation of a 16-nucleotide RNA cleavage product in a rapid chemical quench flow experiment. The RNA primer also contained 2-aminopurine (2-AP) as the penultimate 3\u2019 nucleotide (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), thereby permitting monitoring of 2-AP-p-C dinucleotide release by measuring an increase in 2-AP fluorescence in a stopped flow instrument. In a subset of experiments, the template DNA contained 6-MI nine registers upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) to directly monitor RNAP backtracking by measuring the decrease in 6-MI fluorescence in a stopped flow instrument. Importantly, the changes in 6-MI and 2-AP fluorescence were driven by the RNA cleavage and not GreA binding because the addition of the cleavage-deficient D41N GreA variant did not change either fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We evaluated the NusG effects on backtracking of TECs assembled with RNAPs lacking \u03b2 Gate Loop (\u0394GL), \u03b2\u2019 Lid Loop (\u0394LL) and \u03b2\u2019 Rudder Loop (\u0394RL).

In contrast, \u0394GL and the DNA:DNA mismatch ten nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 slowed backtracking 1.5\u20132 fold but did not affect the TEC responses to NusG. Most notably, TEC with two DNA:DNA mismatches 10\u201311 nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end backtracked approximately fivefold faster than the fully-matched TEC and was insensitive to NusG (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). At the same time, TEC with a 3\u2019 RNA:DNA mismatch cleaved RNA further sevenfold faster than the TEC with two DNA:DNA mismatches (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggesting that backtracking limited the cleavage rate in the latter TEC. These results suggested that: (<i>i</i>) NusG slows backtracking by inhibiting DNA melting eleven nucleotides upstream from the RNA 3\u2019 end; (<i>ii</i>) RL, GL and DNA:DNA pairing ten nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end are dispensable for anti-backtracking activity of NusG; (<i>iii</i>) LL may be involved in the anti-backtracking action of NusG, but is not critically important therein."

We designed a fully complementary TEC containing a unique 5\u00b4-TA-3\u00b4 sequence motif positioned nine nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The template DNA and the RNA primer were 5\u2019 labeled with ATTO680 to monitor DNA:DNA crosslinking and RNA extension by the denaturing PAGE. The system allowed us to probe DNA:DNA base pairing nine (TEC16), ten (TEC17) and eleven (TEC18) nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end by the stepwise extension of the RNA with subsets of NTPs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The assembled TEC16 preparations produced only minute amounts of DNA:DNA crosslinked species as expected: the template DNA thymidine of TA site was anticipated to form the upstream-last base pair of the RNA:DNA hybrid. Upon formation of TEC17, the efficiency of DNA:DNA crosslinking remained low (&lt;15%), despite the entire TA site being potentially available for pairing. In contrast, the crosslinking efficiency exceeded 40% in TEC18, comparable to that observed in a protein-free DNA:DNA duplex (~60%). TGT reduced crosslinking efficiency in TEC18 at least twofold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) consistent with its ability to stabilize TECs in the pre-translocated state (<a href=\"#bib45\">Malinen et al., 2012</a>)."

We used template DNA-RNA photo-crosslinking by a guanine analogue 6-thioguanine (6-TG), to probe the accessibility of RNA to DNA in the absence and presence of NusG. The TECs contained the fully complementary transcription bubble and the 5\u2019 ATTO680-labeled 16-nucleotide RNA primer with the nine nucleotide annealing region. The initial TEC16 contained 6-TG in the template DNA eight base pairs upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Upon exposure to UV light, the TEC16 produced crosslinked DNA-RNA species that migrated considerably slower than the un-crosslinked RNA primer in a denaturing gel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Two major crosslinked species (a band and a smear) were observed that likely originated from 6-TG crosslinks to different RNA bases within the crosslinking range. Walking the RNAP along the DNA revealed that 6-TG efficiently crosslinks to the RNA primer eight (initial TEC16) and nine (TEC17) nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end. Crosslinking was largely abolished when the separation was increased to ten nucleotides in TEC18, yet restored when TEC18 was stabilized in the pre-translocated state by TGT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with the initial TEC16 containing 6-TG nine nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); in this system, crosslinking was abolished upon an extension to form TEC17."

The initial TEC16 contained 6-MI base in template DNA positioned eight base pairs upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end. The TEC was walked along the DNA by up to three positions by the\u00a0addition of subsets of NTPs and the 6-MI fluorescence was monitored (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We attribute the low fluorescence of 6-MI eight nucleotides upstream the RNA 3\u2019 end (the assembled TEC16) to the quenching effect of the upstream guanine that forms the upstream-most base pair of the RNA:DNA hybrid. The elevated 6-MI fluorescence nine nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end is likely due to the unstacking of the upstream quenching guanine because it no longer belongs to the RNA:DNA hybrid. The elevated fluorescence persists ten nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end, arguing that 6-MI does not reestablish the stacking interaction with the upstream guanine. Finally, the 6-MI fluorescence is reduced 11 nucleotides upstream from the RNA 3\u2019 end, likely because 6-MI reestablishes the stacking interaction with the upstream guanine at this position. An\u00a0experiment performed in the presence of TGT suggests that increased 6-MI fluorescence at the upstream edge of the RNA:DNA hybrid originates from a post-translocated TEC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

At the same time, the conformation of the upstream DNA in published TEC models (<a href=\"#bib53\">Opalka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Andrecka et al., 2009</a>) as well as recent X-ray (<a href=\"#bib10\">Barnes et al., 2015</a>) and CryoEM (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bernecky et al., 2016</a>) structures of RNA polymerase II are incompatible with the structure of bacterial TEC (in case of RNA polymerase II models), the upstream DNA mapping data presented here (see below), and/or NusG binding. Similarly, the conformation of the upstream DNA resolved in the crystal structures of the bacterial initiation complexes (<a href=\"#bib81\">Zuo and Steitz, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bae et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2016</a>) is strongly influenced by the sigma factor and therefore is not suitable for modeling of the upstream fork junction in the TEC. To gain the mechanistic insights into the anti-backtracking action of NusG, we used our data to generate an accurate map of the upstream fork junction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) and further employed it to postulate a tentative structural model of a NusG-TEC complex with the upstream DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>)."

The experiments with TECs containing mismatched non-template DNA strand additionally suggest that the upstream DNA base pairs ten nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Specifically, the 8-MP crosslinks the TA site eleven nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end only when DNA is matched ten nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similarly, TECs containing a DNA:DNA mismatch either directly against or one nucleotide upstream of 6-MI start to differ in fluorescence levels from the matched TECs when the mismatch is ten nucleotides from the RNA 3\u2019 end (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, DNA likely base pairs ten nucleotides from the RNA 3\u2019 end, but the first upstream base pair deviates from the geometry of the conventional B-form DNA duplex and/or is highly dynamic (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>)."

We then modelled in the upstream duplex DNA following the overall direction suggested by the published models (<a href=\"#bib53\">Opalka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Andrecka et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bernecky et al., 2016</a>) but avoiding clashes with the NusG NTD and maintaining a canonical B-duplex as far downstream as possible. Joining the upstream duplex with the RNA:DNA hybrid required altering the sugar-phosphate backbone of the downstream-most nucleotides of the upstream DNA but allowed maintaining the DNA base pairing. In the resulting model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>), the upstream DNA has an ample space to move away from the NusG NTD and the \u03b2\u2019 clamp surfaces towards the cleft between the \u03b21 and \u03b2 flap domains by hinging around the downstream most base pair (position ten in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), reflecting the natural flexibility of the upstream DNA (<a href=\"#bib22\">Coban et al., 2006</a>). However, we suggest that the conformation where the upstream DNA lines \u03b2\u2019 clamp and NusG NTD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>) is the most relevant to the NusG effects on transcription elongation. In such a scenario, the two downstream- most base pairs of the upstream DNA (positions ten and eleven in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) occupy a narrow channel walled by NusG NTD and LL, thereby explaining the functional interactions between the NusG, the LL and the upstream DNA in RNA cleavage, crosslinking and fluorescence assays."

More specifically, NusG was found to reduce backtracked but not hairpin-stimulated pauses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pasman and von Hippel, 2000</a>). It was later established that NusG-family proteins bind to, and bridge, the \u03b2\u2019 clamp with the \u03b2 lobe across the RNAP cleft (<a href=\"#bib13\">Belogurov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mooney et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Klein et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011</a>). Biochemical studies further concluded that the archaeal NusG orthologue Spt5 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hirtreiter et al., 2010</a>) and the specialized NusG paralogue RfaH (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sevostyanova et al., 2011</a>) enhance transcription elongation by stabilizing the \u03b2\u2019 clamp in a closed conformation. However, <i>E. coli</i> RfaH accelerates RNAP at pause sites known to involve clamp opening, as well as at the backtracked pauses, whereas <i>E. coli</i> NusG has only marginal effect at the former sites (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kolb et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Anthony et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Belogurov et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, crystal structures of the backtracked TECs revealed the closed clamp (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sekine et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2009</a>), whereas the specificity of <i>E. coli</i> NusG for backtracked pauses was reaffirmed in single molecule experiments (<a href=\"#bib30\">Herbert et al., 2010</a>). Together, these observations suggest that <i>E. coli</i> NusG enhances transcription elongation by means other than restricting the \u03b2\u2019 clamp movement."

In contrast, Herbert <i>et al</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Herbert et al., 2010</a>) concluded that NusG has a modest stimulatory effect (10\u201320%) on the pause-free elongation rate, in addition to inhibiting backtracking. One possibility is that a subset of TECs backtracked by one nucleotide display the elongation rates within the pause-free range compiled by Herbert <i>et al</i>. Alternatively, NusG may have a marginal effect on the elongation rate in a subset of the non-paused on-pathway TECs with yet to be identified sequence determinants. In any case, the effect of NusG on the pause-free elongation rate estimated by Herbert et al is small comparing with the specific effect of NusG on the backtracking rate (~2.5 fold) that we report here."

Overall, our data suggest that the intrinsic action of NusG on the <i>E. coli</i> TEC is restricted to inhibiting backtracking and is exclusively mediated through the upstream fork junction. Remarkably, several other transcription factors, including Mfd (<a href=\"#bib26\">Deaconescu et al., 2006</a>) and UvrD (<a href=\"#bib27\">Epshtein et al., 2014</a>) that link transcription to DNA repair operate through the upstream fork junction."

GL is located more than 20\u00c5 from the duplex DNAs and the RNA:DNA hybrid but may directly contact the single-stranded non-template DNA. Accordingly, we suggest that GL promotes backtracking by altering the conformation of the non-template DNA in a manner that increases the propensity of the TEC to backtrack, e.g. by facilitating the downstream DNA re-annealing. Indeed, GL restricts the downstream portion of the single-stranded non-template DNA within the main channel in the initiation complex (<a href=\"#bib80\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) and may therefore have a similar functionality in the TEC."

However, the upstream DNA is absent from the crystal structures of bacterial TECs, the published models are incompatible with NusG binding, and even the register of the upstream DNA reannealing is uncertain. To gain mechanistic insights into the anti-backtracking action of NusG, we performed a comprehensive mapping of the upstream fork junction using fluorescent base analogues and site-specific crosslinking. Our data are fully consistent with the nine base pairs RNA:DNA hybrid and the upstream DNA duplex that starts eleven base pairs upstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end in the post-translocated TEC (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The effects of DNA mismatches additionally suggest that DNA is paired immediately upstream of the RNA:DNA hybrid. In combination, the data obtained with the matched and mismatched TECs suggest that the first pair of the upstream DNA is unstacked from both the RNA:DNA hybrid and the rest of the upstream DNA."

Such an arrangement plausibly explains the cooperation between NusG and the LL in stabilizing the upstream DNA pairing and inhibiting backtracking. Notably, NusG loop facing the upstream DNA is strictly conserved in size in bacteria and archaea (five amino acids, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), but the evidence for the conserved residue-specific contacts between the NusG and the upstream DNA is lacking. We propose that NusG provides a complementary molecular surface to the paired upstream DNA and possibly also affects the overall direction of the upstream DNA duplex. Finally, NusG likely stabilizes DNA pairing only in a subset of the upstream DNA conformations, yet influences the overall backtracking rate by targeting those conformations that are most favorable for backtracking, <i>i.e.</i>, the non-template DNA is optimally positioned for the strand exchange with the RNA."

One possible explanation is that backtracking and backward translocation are limited by different processes in our system. It has been hypothesized that, rather than moving in sync along the different nucleic acid chains of the TEC, RNAP moves forward by sequentially translocating the RNA:DNA hybrid and the downstream DNA (<a href=\"#bib15\">Brueckner and Cramer, 2008</a>). The synchronous sliding of RNAP along the nucleic acids is only superficially plausible in the 2D schematics (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>) but is much less likely in the actual 3D structure of the TEC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) where the downstream DNA and the RNA:DNA hybrid are separated by a 90\u00b0 bend. Analogously, the backward translocation may involve the sequential translocation of the downstream DNA and the RNA:DNA hybrid. The former process is NusG independent and may limit the rate of the backward translocation, whereas the latter process is modulated by NusG and may be thus rate limiting for backtracking. We further argue that the difficulty of reconciling the large effect of NusG on backtracking with its small (<a href=\"#bib30\">Herbert et al., 2010</a>) or undetectable (this work) effect on the forward and backward translocation in the context of a single-step translocation model lends support to a two-step translocation mechanism."

                                "text": "The available data suggest three independent and structurally plausible effects of NusG NTD on the TEC. First, NusG binds near the upstream fork junction and stabilizes the upstream DNA duplex, thereby inhibiting spontaneous backtracking at most template positions ([<a href=\"#bib30\">Herbert et al., 2010</a>] and this work). Second, the NTD restricts the conformational flexibility of the \u03b2\u2019 clamp, with different outcomes for the transcription elongation. Archaeal Spt5 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hirtreiter et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Schulz et al., 2016</a>) and <i>E. coli</i> RfaH (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sevostyanova et al., 2011</a>) exert at least part of their elongation enhancing effects by stabilizing the clamp. In contrast, clamp stabilization by <i>E. coli</i> NusG only marginally contributes to anti-pausing (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kolb et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Belogurov et al., 2010</a>). Third, NusG binds to specific sequences in the single-stranded non-template DNA, thereby introducing infrequent yet physiologically relevant pauses (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yakhnin et al., 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib77\">2008</a>) and facilitating intrinsic termination in some species (<a href=\"#bib24\">Czyz et al., 2014</a>). Similar effects are well documented for other dissociable factors and TEC components positioned near the single stranded non-template DNA (<a href=\"#bib55\">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Vvedenskaya et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Arimbasseri and Maraia, 2015</a>). Interestingly, <i>T. thermophilus</i> NusG slows down the cognate RNAPs at non-paused sites by an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sevostyanova and Artsimovitch, 2010</a>). It remains to be determined if this unusual effect is mediated through the clamp or contacts with the non-template and upstream DNA."

The stimulation of RNA chain elongation by NusG has been documented in vitro for bacterial (<a href=\"#bib19\">Burova et al., 1995</a>), archaeal (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hirtreiter et al., 2010</a>) and eukaryotic (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wada et al., 1998</a>) transcription systems. The NTD is sufficient for these effects on elongation, but the structural elements that superimpose well between the bacterial NusG NTD and the archaeal Spt5 NTD (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) are limited to (<i>i</i>) the beta sheet that comprises the RNAP-binding site, (<i>ii</i>) the conserved five amino acid loop that we implicate in the anti-backtracking action of <i>E. coli</i> NusG, and (<i>iii</i>) the N-terminus of the \u03b1-helix that follows this loop and possibly interacts with the single-stranded non-template DNA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Crickard et al., 2016</a>). The lack of the strong conservation of the surface residues (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) suggests that the anti-backtracking activity may be determined by the overall fold of the NusG NTD and is only weakly dependent on the nature of the individual amino acid side-chains, consistent with the mutational analysis of <i>E. coli</i> NusG (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mooney et al., 2009b</a>)."

In <i>E. coli</i>, the essential function of NusG is to facilitate termination of transcription by Rho, thereby maintaining the operon borders (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cardinale et al., 2008</a>), suppressing pervasive antisense transcription (<a href=\"#bib57\">Peters et al., 2012</a>), and inhibiting R-loop formation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Krishna Leela et al., 2013</a>). Stimulating Rho-dependent termination is also likely the major, albeit a non-essential, function of <i>B. subtilis</i> NusG (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ingham and Furneaux, 2000</a>). NusG and its paralog RfaH have also been proposed to mediate transcription-translation coupling via direct contacts with S10 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Burmann\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">Burmann and R\u00f6sch, 2011</a>).

Overall, we suggest that the universal conservation of the intrinsic stimulatory activity of NusG family proteins on transcription elongation underscores its importance, but the quantitative assessment of the in vivo role of this functionality in bacteria necessitates the analysis of transcription systems that natively lack Rho and Gre factors, <i>e.g.</i>, those of Cyanobacteria."

RNA, template DNA, non-template DNA and RNAP were present at 1\u20132 \u00b5M during assembly. The exact ratios between the TEC components in different assays are listed in <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>. The assembly was carried out in TB0 buffer for TECs used in backtracking, RNA cleavage and dinucleotide release experiment or in TB10 buffer for TECs used in all the other experiments. In the nucleotide addition experiments the assembled TEC16 were used. In the pyrophosphorolysis and NusG binding experiments the assembled TEC16s were pre-extended into TEC17s with 5 \u00b5M ATP or GTP, respectively. In the former case, the excess of ATP was further removed by passing through the desalting spin columns (40K cutoff) with TB10 buffer.

This factor is extensively described in the literature and has several seemingly independent activities; in addition NusG from different bacterial species has quite opposite effects on distinct RNAP activities. The authors provide rather convincing biochemical and -physical evidence that NusG increases processivity by inhibiting backtracking of RNAP by stabilising the transcription bubble (using in vitro transcription and chemical crosslinking experiments, and fluorescence measurements). This mechanism is in good agreement with the structural understanding of the elongation complex and not unexpected as such. A slight shortcoming of the work is the narrow range of techniques applied, and the absence of any data supporting the in vivo relevance of the suggested mechanism. In other words, does it make any difference to RNAP elongation and gene expression whether NusG modulates the reannealing of the DNA strands at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble? In the cell the elongation complex includes additional factors, NusA and even rho \u2013 how would these alter the effect of NusG on RNAP? Its very interesting to study and describe NusG mechanisms by measuring the incorporation of single nucleotides and recombinant factors in vitro, but does e.g. the genome-wide occupancy of RNAP change in strains harbouring NusG mutants which disrupt the predicted mechanism? I feel that these kind of data would elevate the impact of the type of results presented in the manuscript to be of interest of the general audience of <i>eLife</i>. Alternatively, providing structural information of the RNAP-NusG elongation complex (e.g. using cryoEM) would propel the structural hypothesis beyond a model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, and subsection \u201cMapping the structure of the upstream fork junction\u201d) and provide an additional perspective that would raise the impact of the work required for <i>eLife</i>. Having said that, the data are of very high quality and the conclusions are generally not over interpreted, and the results are of interest to the transcription community, in particular researchers that are working on the detailed molecular mechanisms of RNAP. I enjoyed reading this paper."

Because NusG (with its ortholog Spt5) is the only universally conserved transcription elongation factor across all kingdoms of life and because NusG/Spt5 is involved in the regulation of transcript elongation known to affect the expression of many genes, understanding the action mechanism of NusG/Spt5 is among the more important extant questions in the field of transcriptional regulation. Overall, Turtola and Belogurov provide compelling evidence that NusG from the model bacterium <i>E. coli</i> inhibits backtracking of elongation complexes by favoring pairing of the upstream edge of the DNA bubble. The DNA bubble is integral to the structure and activity of transcription complexes. The authors also provide new insight into the exact configuration of this upstream \"fork-junction\" by showing compelling evidence that the -10 DNA bp immediately upstream of the RNA:DNA hybrid (counting from the template nt positioned in the NTP binding site) is partially re-paired, but stacked on neither the RNA:DNA hybrid nor the exiting upstream duplex, whereas the -11 DNA bp is fully re-paired into an apparently canonical bp stacked on the exiting DNA duplex. The authors provide a hypothetical structural model that positions a conserved loop of NusG in an appropriate location to aid upstream fork-junction reannealing and that may explain the partially complementary role of the RNA polymerase lid-loop in the reannealing process. Although the authors findings do not explain the entire and surprisingly wide range of effects NusG can have on elongation complexes in different organisms, they provide an important framework for future studies. The work is likely to be a high interest the researchers studying the regulation of transcription elongation, which is an area currently undergoing significant growth because so many metazoan genes turn out to be regulated during the process of RNA synthesis rather than at steps preceding transcription initiation. There are a couple significant points that the authors will need to address before the manuscript would be acceptable for publication. These major points, along with a number of minor points are enumerated below."

This claim by the authors will need to be revised for the following reasons. First, a previous study that was much more sensitive to small effects that could aggregate across many successive rounds of nucleotide addition reached the opposite conclusion (Herbert et al., 2010), yet the authors do not explain how the present results invalidate these previous results and conclusion. Indeed, their own result shows a modest increase in the overall rate of a single nucleotide turnover reaction even though it is within their experimental error (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; see bar graphs). Put another way, the modest effects of NusG on pause-free elongation reported previously are not detectable within the experimental error of the present measurements. Further, the authors have looked at only a single template position, whereas the contribution of translocation to elongation and the effect of sequences on upstream fork-junction reannealing and its contribution to translocation and to elongation are certain to vary at different template positions. At least for the basic contribution of translocation to elongation rate, these effects are demonstrated to vary among template positions (e.g., Dangkulwanich et al., 2013 <i>eLife</i> 2: e00971). Given that the authors have provided no evidence to rule out the small effects of NusG previously shown, the authors should modify their conclusion to state that NusG has at most a modest effect on pause-free transcription rate and a greater effect on backtracking, a conclusion indeed essentially the same as that reached by Herbert et al."

The authors have appropriately presented this model conservatively given the lack of direct evidence for the NusG-DNA interaction they propose. That said, the impact of the manuscript can be significantly improved by more clearly presenting the model and its implications, as described here and in the next point. First, the authors can much better illustrate their proposed structure for the upstream fork junction. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> is OK as far as it goes, but it does not aid the viewer in understanding the fork-junction structure nor does it identify the 5 aa loop in NusG proposed to aid in junction reannealing. I suggest the authors prepare additional panels that show two things. In one additional panel, they should show the fork junction from a different perspective so that the partially paired nature of the -10 by and stacking of the -11 bp is more easily understood. Why not use actual base structures for this panel, rather than the simplified stick diagrams that don't really illustrate stacking (or the absence of stacking)? In a second additional panel, the authors should show the sequence of the 5 aa loop and parts of the flanking sheet and helix from <i>E. coli</i> aligned with small number of examples from a diverse evolutionary range of organisms. Please include numbering in this panel so that readers can readily relate the sequences shown to the sequences to full-length NusG/Spt5 sequences."

The authors suggest an entirely reasonable hypothesis that hybrid translocation and downstream DNA translocation may be two distinct, if interconnected, steps, rather than a single translocation event, and that NusG will principally affect events, like backtracking, for which hybrid translocation is rate-limiting). I think this is an important idea, and that the authors could expand their description of it somewhat without crossing the line to overinterpretation of their results. From my perspective, it would be appropriate to say that not only can the preferential effect of NusG on backtracking potentially be explained by the tw0-translocation model, but also that the difficulty of reconciling the large effect of NusG on backtracking and the modest effect on translocation and elongation more generally in the context of a single-step translocation model supports the a two-step translocation mechanism. As long as it's stated this way, and not that the results somehow prove the two-step model, then I think the authors could improve the impact of their manuscript by slightly expanding the discussion of this point."

We argue that this assumption is only superficially plausible. The fact that many pauses are backtracked does not prove that all backtracked TECs are paused. We suggest that the long-backtracked TECs are perhaps indeed universally paused, but the TECs backtracked by one nucleotide are not necessarily paused and may display a relatively fast elongation rate. For example, backtracking occurs with the rate of ~0.3 s<sup>-1</sup> in the TECs with the mismatched upstream DNA (we chose the fastest to backtrack in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). At the same time, we do not observe a measurable fraction of the backtracked state in that system before GreA is added. Considering the experimental uncertainties, we estimate that the backtracked state occupancy is \u226410%. The above two values suggest that the TEC backtracked by one nucleotide recovers with the rate \u22653 s<sup>-1</sup>, well within the range of pause-free elongation rates observed by Herbert et al. From the thermodynamic standpoint, the Brownian ratchet model of RNAP translocation postulates that there is the same amount of energy available for the forward translocation from the pre- to post-translocated state and from the backtracked to the pre-translocated state. Next, there is no a priori indication that the energy barrier between the 1-nt backtracked and the pre-translocated states is uniformly high to equate short backtracking with pausing."

This factor is extensively described in the literature and has several seemingly independent activities; in addition NusG from different bacterial species has quite opposite effects on distinct RNAP activities. The authors provide rather convincing biochemical and -physical evidence that NusG increases processivity by inhibiting backtracking of RNAP by stabilising the transcription bubble (using in vitro transcription and chemical crosslinking experiments, and fluorescence measurements). This mechanism is in good agreement with the structural understanding of the elongation complex and not unexpected as such. A slight shortcoming of the work is the narrow range of techniques applied, and the absence of any data supporting the in vivo relevance of the suggested mechanism. In other words, does it make any difference to RNAP elongation and gene expression whether NusG modulates the reannealing of the DNA strands at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble? In the cell the elongation complex includes additional factors, NusA and even rho \u2013 how would these alter the effect of NusG on RNAP? Its very interesting to study and describe NusG mechanisms by measuring the incorporation of single nucleotides and recombinant factors in vitro, but does e.g. the genome-wide occupancy of RNAP change in strains harbouring NusG mutants which disrupt the predicted mechanism? I feel that these kind of data would elevate the impact of the type of results presented in the manuscript to be of interest of the general audience of eLife. Alternatively, providing structural information of the RNAP-NusG elongation complex (e.g. using cryoEM) would propel the structural hypothesis beyond a model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, and subsection \u201cMapping the structure of the upstream fork junction\u201d) and provide an additional perspective that would raise the impact of the work required for eLife. Having said that, the data are of very high quality and the conclusions are generally not over interpreted, and the results are of interest to the transcription community, in particular researchers that are working on the detailed molecular mechanisms of RNAP. I enjoyed reading this paper.</i> "

We argue that the importance of NusG for regulating the activity of Rho masks the other functionalities of NusG in <i>E. coli</i>. At the same time, the anti-backtracking activity of NusG family proteins is likely determined by the fold of the NTD so it is not straightforward to construct a NusG variant with an unaltered fold that is fully devoid of such activity. We further suggest that the quantitative assessment of the in vivo role of elongation stimulation by NusG in bacteria necessitates the analysis of transcription systems that natively lack Rho, e.g., those of Cyanobacteria."

However, such expansion requires rigorous tests of the effects of several factors in several assays individually and in combination. In addition, many factors require considerably longer RNA for the full functionality than the one that we used to assemble TECs on the nucleic acid scaffold (16-18 nt). It is very straightforward to add NusA to our existing systems, but we do not think that the result of such <i>ad hoc</i> experiment will be conclusive. Accordingly, we suggest that the expansion of the study to include more factors is outside the scope of the present manuscript."

This claim by the authors will need to be revised for the following reasons. First, a previous study that was much more sensitive to small effects that could aggregate across many successive rounds of nucleotide addition reached the opposite conclusion (Herbert et al., 2010), yet the authors do not explain how the present results invalidate these previous results and conclusion. Indeed, their own result shows a modest increase in the overall rate of a single nucleotide turnover reaction even though it is within their experimental error (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; see bar graphs). Put another way, the modest effects of NusG on pause-free elongation reported previously are not detectable within the experimental error of the present measurements. Further, the authors have looked at only a single template position, whereas the contribution of translocation to elongation and the effect of sequences on upstream fork-junction reannealing and its contribution to translocation and to elongation are certain to vary at different template positions. At least for the basic contribution of translocation to elongation rate, these effects are demonstrated to vary among template positions (e.g., Dangkulwanich et al., 2013 eLife 2: e00971). Given that the authors have provided no evidence to rule out the small effects of NusG previously shown, the authors should modify their conclusion to state that NusG has at most a modest effect on pause-free transcription rate and a greater effect on backtracking, a conclusion indeed essentially the same as that reached by Herbert et al.</i> "

However, the normalized translocation curves obtained in the parallel experiments with the same TEC preparation +-NusG fully overlap in several independent experiments. Admittedly, the combined analysis of the nucleotide addition and translocation data exaggerated the differences between the total half-lives of the nucleotide addition cycle +-NusG. To address this problem we performed analysis using more datasets and altered the data presentation. Specifically, we now acknowledge that the upper and the lower bounds for the half-lives of the translocation and the nucleotide addition steps should not be treated as independent when estimating the total half-life of the nucleotide addition cycle.

Why not use actual base structures for this panel, rather than the simplified stick diagrams that don't really illustrate stacking (or the absence of stacking)? In a second additional panel, the authors should show the sequence of the 5 aa loop and parts of the flanking sheet and helix from E. coli aligned with small number of examples from a diverse evolutionary range of organisms.

The authors suggest an entirely reasonable hypothesis that hybrid translocation and downstream DNA translocation may be two distinct, if interconnected, steps, rather than a single translocation event, and that NusG will principally affect events, like backtracking, for which hybrid translocation is rate-limiting). I think this is an important idea, and that the authors could expand their description of it somewhat without crossing the line to overinterpretation of their results. From my perspective, it would be appropriate to say that not only can the preferential effect of NusG on backtracking potentially be explained by the tw0-translocation model, but also that the difficulty of reconciling the large effect of NusG on backtracking and the modest effect on translocation and elongation more generally in the context of a single-step translocation model supports the a two-step translocation mechanism.
