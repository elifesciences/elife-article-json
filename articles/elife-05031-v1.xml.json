In the ER lumen, accumulation of unfolded proteins activates the transmembrane ER-stress sensor Ire1 and drives its oligomerization. In the cytosol, Ire1 recruits <i>HAC1</i> mRNA, mediating its non-conventional splicing. The spliced mRNA is translated into Hac1, the key transcription activator of UPR target genes that mitigate ER-stress. In this study, we report that oligomeric assembly of the ER-lumenal domain is sufficient to drive Ire1 clustering. Clustering facilitates Ire1's cytosolic oligomeric assembly and <i>HAC1</i> mRNA docking onto a positively charged motif in Ire1's cytosolic linker domain that tethers the kinase/RNase to the transmembrane domain. By the use of a synthetic bypass, we demonstrate that mRNA docking per se is a pre-requisite for initiating Ire1's RNase activity and, hence, splicing. We posit that such step-wise engagement between Ire1 and its mRNA substrate contributes to selectivity and efficiency in UPR signaling."

In the ER lumen, accumulation of unfolded proteins activates the transmembrane ER-stress sensor Ire1 and drives its oligomerization. In the cytosol, Ire1 recruits <i>HAC1</i> mRNA, mediating its non-conventional splicing. The spliced mRNA is translated into Hac1, the key transcription activator of UPR target genes that mitigate ER-stress. In this study, we report that oligomeric assembly of the ER-lumenal domain is sufficient to drive Ire1 clustering. Clustering facilitates Ire1's cytosolic oligomeric assembly and <i>HAC1</i> mRNA docking onto a positively charged motif in Ire1's cytosolic linker domain that tethers the kinase/RNase to the transmembrane domain. By the use of a synthetic bypass, we demonstrate that mRNA docking per se is a pre-requisite for initiating Ire1's RNase activity and, hence, splicing. We posit that such step-wise engagement between Ire1 and its mRNA substrate contributes to selectivity and efficiency in UPR signaling."

In eukaryotic cells including yeast, a sensor protein called Ire1 detects when unfolded proteins build up in the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, the Ire1 sensor proteins join together to form clusters and an mRNA molecule called <i>HAC1</i> is specifically recruited to the Ire1 clusters. The portions of the Ire1 protein that extend out from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cell proper then bind to <i>HAC1</i> mRNA and cut a piece out of it. This edited mRNA encodes the instructions to build a protein that in turn boosts the expression of various components\u2014including the appropriate molecular chaperones\u2014that are needed to alleviate the stress caused by an excess of unfolded proteins."

Now, van Anken et al. show that these interactions are sufficient for forming and maintaining clusters. The interactions between the portions of the Ire1 proteins outside of the endoplasmic reticulum are needed for editing the <i>HAC1</i> mRNA but not for forming and maintaining the clusters or for recruiting the <i>HAC1</i> mRNA molecule to bind to Ire1. Instead, van Anken et al. discovered an mRNA binding site on the Ire1 clusters, which is separate from the part of the Ire1 protein that cuts the mRNA molecules. The Ire1 protein needs to first bind the <i>HAC1</i> mRNA molecule at this binding site before it can cut it; van Anken et al. suggest that this two-step process helps ensure accurate and efficient editing of the <i>HAC1</i> mRNA by Ire1. This process could also help to minimize the chance of other mRNA molecules being edited by mistake."

Assisted by ER-resident enzymes, they undergo oxidative folding, modification, and assembly reactions. When properly folded, they are packaged into ER exit vesicles and travel to their final destination in the endomembrane system, on the cell surface or, after secretion, outside of the cell. Proteins that do not reach maturity are degraded by the proteasome after retrotranslocation into the cytosol (via ER-associated degradation) or by autophagy (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van Anken and Braakman, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bernales et al., 2006</a>).

On the cytosolic side, Ire1 activation results in the non-conventional splicing of <i>HAC1</i> mRNA, which is cleaved by Ire1's RNase domain at two splice sites, releasing a single intron (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sidrauski and Walter, 1997</a>). Upon ligation of the severed exons, the spliced mRNA is translated to produce the Hac1 transcription activator that drives expression of UPR target genes to mitigate ER-stress (<a href=\"#bib40\">Travers et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>).

Two ER-lumenal domain (LD) interfaces, IF1<sup>L</sup> and IF2<sup>L</sup> (\u2018L\u2019 for lumenal), which were identified in the crystal structure of yeast Ire1 LD and validated by mutagenesis, mediate oligomeric assembly of the LD (<a href=\"#bib6\">Credle et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kimata et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>). Dimerization via IF1<sup>L</sup> yields a composite groove extending across the LDs of two Ire1 molecules (<a href=\"#bib6\">Credle et al., 2005</a>). Unfolded stretches of polypeptides bind within this groove of Ire1 LD, causing its oligomerization in vitro (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>). Proximal activation of the UPR in vivo coincides with the dissociation of Kar2 (the yeast homolog of the ER-lumenal hsp70 chaperone BiP) from Ire1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kimata et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pincus et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). Yet, Ire1 mutants with impaired Kar2 binding still respond to ER-stress, although the threshold for activation is lowered (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kimata et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pincus et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). Thus, misfolded proteins likely are direct ligands that activate Ire1, while Kar2 fine-tunes the signaling (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pincus et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>)."

The lumenal and cytosolic domain filaments predicted by the crystal structures have a different pitch and thus for steric reasons cannot be collinear. Instead, a two-dimensional arrangement of the two filaments, featuring \u223c20\u201330 Ire1 molecules, provides a model for the higher-order assembly in vivo (<a href=\"#bib24\">Korennykh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This model is compatible with the size of Ire1 foci observed by fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009</a>) and is sterically feasible despite the twists of the filaments on either side of the planar membrane, owing to the flexibility and length (&gt;100 \u00c5) of the linker domains on either side of the membrane, which can relieve the strain. Alternatively and not mutually exclusive, Ire1 clusters may be dynamic, such that constant rearrangements of the Ire1 molecules in clusters sustain transient intermittent oligomerization events on either side of the membrane."

Ire1 cleaves the intron at the splice sites indicated by blue arrowheads. The 3\u2032 UTR (gray) harbors a stem-loop structure with the 3\u2032 BE (red) that facilitates recruitment of the <i>HAC1</i> mRNA to Ire1 foci (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009</a>).

Middle: the green bar depicts the GFP ORF (green) that replaces part of the <i>HAC1</i> sequence in the splicing reporter (SpR). Translation of GFP only occurs when the intron is spliced from the mRNA, because removal of the intron by Ire1's endonuclease activity lifts a translational block caused by base pairing between the intron and the 5\u2032 UTR (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pincus et al., 2010</a>).

Primary docking of the mRNA to this site is required for subsequent processing of the mRNA by Ire1's RNase domain.

To analyze the role for the [+]-box in Ire1 function in vivo, we first truncated Ire1 further such that the [+]-box was deleted (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Since we could not obtain a centromeric plasmid of this construct, as it was toxic for <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we created <i>ire1\u0394</i> strains with a genomic copy of the <i>ire1\u0394KR</i> or <i>ire1\u0394KR/\u0394[+]-box</i> mCherry-tagged transgenes in the <i>LEU2</i> locus.

Further removal of the [+]-box did not affect Ire1 clustering but markedly reduced mRNA recruitment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This finding suggests that the [+]-box is key for the docking of mRNA onto Ire1 clusters. Moreover, given that the extent of clustering of the <i>ire1 (\u0394KR/\u0394[+]-box)</i> mutant was similar to wild-type, we conclude that Ire1 clustering is driven by the lumenal domain alone: neither cytosolic oligomeric assembly (as facilitated by the kinase/RNase domains) nor mRNA docking (as facilitated by the [+]-box) is required for Ire1 foci formation."

To avoid interference with mutations in the linker, we relocated the fluorescent modules to the \u03b1F\u2013\u03b1EF loop in the Ire1 kinase domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). By contrast to the activation loop (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which becomes hyperphosphorylated due to Ire1's kinase activity, the \u03b1F\u2013\u03b1EF loop is poorly conserved (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and dispensable for Ire1 activity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib24\">Korennykh et al., 2009</a>).

These mutants were expressed at similar levels as the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

The [+]-box was shown previously to act as a nuclear import signal when inserted into heterologous proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Goffin et al., 2006</a>). For Ire1, however, such a role is unlikely, since tampering with the [+]-box had no effect on the distribution throughout the ER on either of non-clustered Ire1 in the absence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) or of Ire1 foci in the presence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) of ER-stress.

Replacement of all non-basic residues (including the three conserved glycines) in the [+]-box with arginines or lysines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, \u2018all [+] mutant\u2019) disrupted splicing and survival upon ER-stress almost to the level of the mutants of the conserved arginines. This observation suggests that a positively charged cluster alone is not sufficient but that the glycines afford proper display (spacing or three-dimensional positioning) of the crucial arginine side chains."

Since the [+]-box is unlikely to contribute to the core enzymatic function of Ire1, as it is not conserved in all eukaryotes, we reasoned that the docking mechanism itself is important to initiate splicing activity. To test this idea, we created a synthetic bypass for [+]-box mediated docking by inserting the U1A RNA binding module into the \u03b1F\u2013\u03b1EF loop of the <i>ire1(\u0394[+]-box)</i> mutant. We reasoned that the insertion of the U1A module would allow direct interaction of the Ire1\u2013U1A fusion protein with <i>HAC1</i><sup>U1A</sup> mRNA via the U1A-binding hairpins that we had introduced into the 3\u2032 UTR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), which we thus far employed in the mRNAs for visualization purposes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Strikingly, the U1A module considerably restored splicing and growth under ER-stress conditions of <i>ire1(\u0394[+]-box)</i> mutant complemented with <i>HAC1</i><sup>U1A</sup> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, docking of the mRNA per se to a site distinct from the kinase/RNase domain is key for the mRNA to be processed by Ire1.

This finding confirms that 3\u2032 BE-mediated mRNA targeting is an event separate from mRNA docking (whether mediated by the [+]-box or the U1A \u2018bypass\u2019). Taken together, these results indicate that the engagement of <i>HAC1</i> mRNA with Ire1 is a step-wise process. The 3\u2032 BE directs translationally repressed <i>HAC1</i> mRNA to sites where Ire1 clusters, which is driven solely by oligomeric assembly of its LD.

A key contribution of arginine residues is common to RNA binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lazinski et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tan and Frankel, 1995</a>), suggesting that mRNA binding to the [+]-box is direct. In particular, the [+]-box encompasses a conserved arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) motif, which in the form of repeats adorns several RNA binding protein families, including snRNPs, hnRNPs, and snoRNPs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Godin and Varani, 2007</a>). Via combined low-affinity interactions, RGG boxes synergize in the assembly of RNA\u2013protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Godin and Varani, 2007</a>). Along these lines it is plausible that when Ire1 is monomeric, the [+]-boxes of individual Ire1 molecules may not sustain RNA binding, which can explain the lack of mRNA recruitment under non-ER-stress conditions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Clustering of [+]-boxes, resulting from Ire1 LD-driven oligomerization, would generate the required synergistic avidity, such that only clustered [+]-boxes form a docking platform for the mRNA."

Moreover, even when mRNA docking was facilitated by the U1A-mediated \u2018bypass\u2019, the 3\u2032 BE still contributed to <i>HAC1</i> mRNA splicing efficiency. These data indicate that 3\u2032 BE-mediated <i>HAC1</i> mRNA targeting operates independently from [+]-box-mediated mRNA docking. In the well-studied example of <i>ASH1</i> mRNA targeting to the bud tip in yeast, three steps can be distinguished: mRNA particle formation (which requires the She2 and She4 proteins), mRNA transport into the bud (which requires the She1, Myo4, and She3 proteins), and finally mRNA anchoring at the bud tip (which requires the She5, Bni1, Bud6, and Aip3 proteins) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beach and Bloom, 2001</a>). By analogy, Ire1 clusters may contain additional \u2018anchoring\u2019 factors for <i>HAC1</i> mRNA. The putative <i>trans</i>-acting factors postulated to bind the 3\u2032 BE <i>cis</i>-acting element and guide <i>HAC1</i> mRNA to Ire1 clusters and those to mark the clusters and receive the incoming traffic remain unknown, as is the mechanism by which they would respond to ER-stress."

Rather, <i>XBP1</i> mRNA (the metazoan ortholog of <i>HAC1</i> mRNA) is targeted to the ER membrane via a hydrophobic signal encoded in the unspliced mRNA (<a href=\"#bib43\">Yanagitani et al., 2009</a>). This mechanism limits diffusion of the mRNA substrate to the two-dimensional plane of the membrane and thus may present an evolutionary bypass for docking via the [+]-box, functionally equivalent to the synthetic U1A bypass we describe here. Alternatively, membrane targeting in metazoans may represent the first targeting step that precedes a more specific docking event. Intriguingly, plants may employ both strategies: the unspliced substrate mRNA encodes a protein containing a hydrophobic membrane anchor (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deng et al., 2011</a>), allowing pre-recruitment to the ER-membrane, while the conserved basic linker motif in plant Ire1 homologs may serve as a dedicated mRNA docking site for further selectivity in the recruitment process."

Both in <i>Drosophila</i> and human cells, IRE1 processing of mRNA targets other than <i>XBP1</i> mRNA under prolonged ER-stress has been reported as part of an RNA-degradative pathway presumed to reduce the load of proteins entering the ER, called regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Han et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hollien et al., 2009</a>). In <i>S. pombe</i>, which lacks <i>HAC1,</i> ER-stress is mitigated by Ire1 exclusively through RIDD and targets primarily mRNAs that encode proteins destined to enter the ER (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kimmig et al., 2012</a>). In view of our data, RIDD may be invoked through modulating the stringency of mRNA delivery to and/or docking onto Ire1 clusters and may be precluded in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> due to the stringency of the step-wise process. The organization of the engagement between Ire1 and its mRNA substrate(s) into multiple steps, that is targeting, docking, priming, and cleavage, thus emerges as integral to upholding selectivity and efficiency of Ire1-mediated mRNA processing and, hence, of UPR signaling."
