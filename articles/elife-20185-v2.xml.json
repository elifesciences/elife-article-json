Such limitations are prominent in the context of groups where the relevant information at the individual level may not coincide with collective requirements. Here, we study the navigational decisions exhibited by <i>Paratrechina longicornis</i> ants as they cooperatively transport a large food item. These decisions hinge on the perception of individuals which often restricts them from providing the group with reliable directional information. We find that, to achieve efficient navigation despite partial and even misleading information, these ants employ a locally-blazed trail. This trail significantly deviates from the classical notion of an ant trail: First, instead of systematically marking the full path, ants mark short segments originating at the load. Second, the carrying team constantly loses the guiding trail. We experimentally and theoretically show that the locally-blazed trail optimally and robustly exploits useful knowledge while avoiding the pitfalls of misleading information."

Such limitations are prominent in the context of groups where the relevant information at the individual level may not coincide with collective requirements. Here, we study the navigational decisions exhibited by <i>Paratrechina longicornis</i> ants as they cooperatively transport a large food item. These decisions hinge on the perception of individuals which often restricts them from providing the group with reliable directional information. We find that, to achieve efficient navigation despite partial and even misleading information, these ants employ a locally-blazed trail. This trail significantly deviates from the classical notion of an ant trail: First, instead of systematically marking the full path, ants mark short segments originating at the load. Second, the carrying team constantly loses the guiding trail. We experimentally and theoretically show that the locally-blazed trail optimally and robustly exploits useful knowledge while avoiding the pitfalls of misleading information."

This shows that when cooperating to move large objects, the ants use scent marks to form a new type of trail that is highly dynamic. Unlike other ant trails that mark the whole path between the food and the nest, these new trails only direct the next step of the movement. Furthermore, the team of ants carrying the item only follows these local directions in a loose manner and often ignores them."

This allows the group to benefit from the useful information available to individuals while avoiding local traps that may occur when these individuals wrongly direct them towards dead ends."

However, even in the absence of noise, cognitive or sensory limitations filter those aspects of the environment that are perceived by an organism (<a href=\"#bib83\">Von Uexkull, 1957</a>). Relying on partial knowledge may result in maladaptive decisions (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schlaepfer et al., 2002</a>), where even a single bad decision somewhere among a long sequence of good ones has the potential to lead along an undesirable path (<a href=\"#bib82\">von Herrath et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Davies, 2000</a>).

The inherent scale differences that characterize this behavior hold the potential of introducing conflicts between the knowledge available to individual ants to that required for the load\u2019s navigation. This system provides a unique opportunity for studying the consequences and possible resolution of such conflicts due to two main reasons. The first is experimental tangibility: In the context of cooperative transport, abstract decision making processes are manifested as collective motions; Sequences of decisions are evident as the load\u2019s direction changes wherein bad turns eventually lead toward dead-ends. Second, cooperative transport is highly efficient as a general transportation solution. Ants manage to maneuver a wide range of loads while quickly navigating through complex terrains and back to their nest (<a href=\"#bib25\">Czaczkes and Ratnieks, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Gelblum et al., 2015</a>)."

Similar to other ant species, <i>P. longircornis</i> employ a pheromonal recruitment mechanism (<a href=\"#bib27\">Czaczkes et al., 2013b</a>). Here, we demonstrate, for the first time in any ant species, the use of scent marks that assist navigation during the retrieval stage of cooperative transport.

This is because individual ants appear to be ignorant of the accessible paths from the perspective of the much larger load. When grouped together, the scent marks collectively left by the ants form a <i>locally-blazed</i> trail that is characterized by short range markings and highly stochastic following. We discuss the traits of this trail in the context of previously described trails and suggest that it should be considered as a new kind of ant trail. We further use an algorithmic approach to show how the unique characteristics of the locally-blazed trail are suited to the distinct navigational challenges of cooperative transport. To support our theoretical and numerical findings, we present experimental evidence for efficiency in the ants' collective motion along with experimental verification of some of the\u00a0model's predictions."

In fact, the high volatility of undecane makes it a prevalent ant alarm pheromone (<a href=\"#bib39\">Fujiwara-Tsujii et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Blum, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lenz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Regnier and Wilson, 1968</a>).

This behavior significantly deviates from classical trail following behavior as exhibited by numerous ant species as well as <i>P. longicornis</i> itself in other scenarios (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, ants wander off both the classical trail (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beekman and Dussutour, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Deneubourg et al., 1983</a>) and the locally-blazed trail. However, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> demonstrates the stark difference between these two cases: Of the <i>P. longicornis</i> ants walking along a 'classical trail', at most 10% of them lose the trail which remains stable over time (up to several days) and over long distances. Conversely, in the locally-blazed trail the probability that the moving load approaches a scent mark continuously diminishes with distance so that segments of the trail marked even slightly away of the object become practically irrelevant to subsequent movement. We note that this observation is in agreement with the fast evaporation of undecane (<a href=\"#bib88\">Witte et al., 2007b</a>). At first glance, abandoning the trail, especially the initial well-trodden recruitment trail which marks the direct path to the nest, after such short distances, seems to be counter intuitive and even mal-adaptive."

To test this hypothesis, we simulated the presence of natural obstacles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>) by constructing a barrier which has a slit at its center that easily allows for passage of ants but is too narrow for the load. This configuration results in markings that guide the load towards the dead-end (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, green marks). We find that rather than being caught in a deadlock, the transported load leaves the misleading scent marks and commences a perpendicular motion along, and eventually around, the obstacle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This effect of stochasticity is, in some sense, reminiscent of the positive role held by individual ants that wander off classical ant trails (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beekman and Dussutour, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Deneubourg et al., 1983</a>) (more about this point in the Discussion below)."

In light of this unpredictable motion, investing in the construction of a long trail that connects the moving load to the nest appears to be wasteful. Indeed, we find that the vast majority of individual ants deposit markings in bouts which originate near the load (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), are directed towards the nest (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and terminate a short distance away (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) much before they get anywhere near the nest (which is several meters away).

First, rather than designating the whole route between the food and the nest (<a href=\"#bib47\">H\u00f6lldobler et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cammaerts and Cammaerts, 1980</a>) (or any other two stable points that are, in no sense, required to be proximal [<a href=\"#bib53\">Latty et al., 2011</a>]); the locally-blazed trail is segmented and continuously formed in the vicinity of the object such that it implies only the next step to be taken. This locality holds on the collective level that takes into account all marking ants and is very different from the classical long-range punctuated or intermittent trail marking by individual ants as previously described (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beckers et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aron et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cammaerts and Cammaerts, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Hangartner, 1969</a>). Second, as the load occasionally deviates from the trail another trail dynamically forms in front of it. This happens in open space (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) as well as near an obstacle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Interestingly, the length scales of the deviation from the scent trail and the marking bout length both match and are on the order of 10 cm, possibly reflecting an evolutionary dependency between the two."

To model the unreliability of scent marks resulting from complex and unpredictable topologies, we assume that, although advice pointers typically point to the correct neighboring node, they sometimes point at an arbitrary direction."

We used simulations to calculate the stretch of path generated by <i>Probabilistic-Following</i> on the 2D grid. These simulations include two parameters: the fraction of correct advice (advice reliability) and the following probability of the navigational algorithm. We find that the stretch is very low (under 3) over a large fraction of the parameter space which spans following probabilities between 0.5 and 0.9 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This implies that for a given environment, there is a large range of following probabilities that\u00a0perform almost equally as well as the best possible following probability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, fixing the following probability to a single value within this range yields near optimal performance for almost every value of the advice reliability (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). To summarize, <i>Probabilistic-Following</i> is highly robust in the sense that it achieves near-optimal performance with hardly any requirement to fine-tune its parameters to the statistics of the environment.

To test this prediction, we challenged the carrying team with an 80 cm obstacle similar to that depicted in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> but modified such that the only path free for ant passage is through the slit and any bypass from the left or the right is blocked (see <i>enclosed-configuration</i> <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Such interactions are inevitable and include, at the least, the physical interaction between the load and the obstacle wall. While these interactions may induce some perpendicular motion (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) our result shows that, in general, this is insufficient to efficiently guide the group around the obstacle.

We can then use this rate to estimate the power of the exponential in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>. These two values are related since, in the enclosed-configuration\u00a0experiment, all scent marks lead towards the slit and any movement away from it must result from instances in which the group moves against pheromonal markings.

A first difference is a direct consequence of the presence or absence of scale discrepancies between individual ants and the load they carry. During the transport of small items marking ants and carrying ants can, to a large extent, traverse the same paths (it is often the case that laden ants concurrently mark the path). In this case, the information communicated by trail laying ants is directly valuable to those that retrieve the food. This is not the case when large food items are involved. Simply put, in the context of cooperative transport, a passage that is open for a marking ant may be inaccessible for the larger load. Accordingly, we find that while scent marks typically point the group in the correct direction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>) they may, at certain topological circumstances, be systematically misleading (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5A\u2013B</a>). A second difference between the two contexts involves the degree of dynamics that characterizes the navigational challenge. Scent marks deposited during the transport of small food items assist traffic between two stationary locations (e.g. the pile of seeds and the nest) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Franks et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bruce and Burd, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Plowes\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bottinelli et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Buhl et al., 2009</a>).

First, this trail is locally-blazed, <i>i.e.</i> it is composed of short broken segments that are dynamically laid in the near vicinity of the moving load. Unlike classical ant trails where individual ants lay scent marks over long distances that are on the length scale of the distance to the nest (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cammaerts and Cammaerts, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beckers et al., 1992b</a>), here, marking ants indicate only the next step to be taken (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This highly transient role of the scent marks is reflected in their chemical makeup where the major component is the highly volatile pheromone undecane. Second, classical ant trails are typically clearly bounded and narrow. This is a result of the relatively strict manner in which ants follow the scent marks (<a href=\"#bib16\">Bruce and Burd, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Eidmann, 1927</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Carthy,\u00a01951</a>) which dominates over a secondary stochastic process where some ants distributively and individually wander off the trail (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beekman and Dussutour, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Deneubourg et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Perna et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Gordon, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Goss et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Reid et al., 2011</a>). The situation is very different for the locally-blazed trail which does not have well defined boundaries. This is a result of repeated occasions in which the entire group of carrying ants collectively and simultaneously loses the trail (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In turn, the trail is then reassembled from another location (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>)."

A first challenge is the highly dynamic nature of the cooperative transport process wherein the constant motion of one of the trail\u2019s end-points (i.e. the food load) leads to low predictability. Above, we have discussed how the local nature of marking behavior is compatible with these circumstances. A second main challenge that must be overcome during cooperative transport is the high propensity for deadlocks. Here, the challenge faced by the ants is not only to overcome isolated deadlocks but, rather, to successfully go through a long sequence of decisions while avoiding the accumulations of errors that may rise due to maladaptive choices. Below, we discuss the efficiency of stochastic following in this context."

Specifically, we studied an ant-inspired algorithm which includes imperfect (stochastic) responsiveness to local, occasionally misleading, advice. An intuitive version of this problem involves driving a car in an unknown country that is in the aftermath of a major hurricane which has randomly flipped a certain small fraction of the road-signs. A driver's goal is to reach her destination as quickly as possible. If the driver chooses to follow all signs, she can be trapped in an infinite loop. Altogether ignoring signs is also inefficient since this fails to utilize the useful information that is contained in unflipped signs. We analyze the algorithm in which the driver follows any road-sign she encounters with some fixed probability and takes a random direction otherwise. Adapting results from the mathematical field of Random Walks in Random Environments (<a href=\"#bib34\">Drewitz et\u00a0al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Sznitman, 2002</a>), we have shown that this ant-inspired algorithm yields near-optimal navigation in topologies that are relevant to ant cooperative transport. Furthermore, the driver need not know exactly what fraction of the road-signs have been flipped. The robustness of the algorithm (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) implies that the time it takes to reach the destination does not strongly depend on the probability at which the\u00a0driver chooses to ignore the road-signs. The lack of a\u00a0requirement for fine-tuning is a favorable trait when modeling biological systems which are inherently noisy and must function in contexts of unforeseen external challenges."

We note, however, that a rigorous proof would highly depend on the particular given model and may become extremely hard mathematically. In fact, even proving that this strategy holds with respect to navigation in general graph structures seems to be beyond the scope of currently known techniques (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary\u00a0file\u00a01-4</a>), and remains a challenging mathematical question for future theoretical investigations."

It is further interesting to discuss this form of collective navigation in the context of collective decision making in other animal groups. To remain as a cohesive group, social animals have to take decisions collectively (<a href=\"#bib22\">Conradt et al., 2007</a>). A common strategy for reaching quality decisions is to follow the majority (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ame et al., 2006</a>). Majority based averaging mechanisms have been shown to help the group reach accurate decisions even when its members' individual perception is inaccurate and noisy (<a href=\"#bib32\">Dell'Ariccia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Simons, 2004</a>). Majority based decision making has also been demonstrated to be helpful even in the context of conflict (<a href=\"#bib23\">Couzin et al., 2011</a>): It is often the case that information perceived by each individual group member encompasses only a small fragment of the complete environmental state. This may result in a case wherein different group members drive the group towards different, often disjoint, collective choices (<a href=\"#bib38\">Franks et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Seeley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Biro et al., 2006</a>). However, if individuals sense their environment in a reliable manner then favorable choices will be supported by a larger number of individuals than less favorable ones. In this case majority boosting techniques such as opinion polling (<a href=\"#bib38\">Franks et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Seeley et al., 2012</a>), quorum sensing (<a href=\"#bib38\">Franks et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Seeley et al., 2012</a>), and collective motion patterns (<a href=\"#bib24\">Couzin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Strandburg-Peshkin et al., 2015</a>) can assure that the group as a whole followed the best alternative."

The noisy component of the locally blazed ant trail falls within this group of collective phenomenon. An interesting distinction is that while previous observations often focused on noise and exploration in the context of a single choice we demonstrate its usefulness in a more complex situation involving a string of strongly dependent decisions. We show both theoretically and experimentally (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) how the locally blazed trail suffices to efficiently navigate the group over long distances. Our work suggests that the usefulness of noise and local exploration in animal groups extends beyond short time scales and single decisions and may actually be efficient for the long time scales and multiple decisions that characterize any biological system."

In this work, we focused on the scale of the team (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson, 2001</a>) of carrying ants and studied the relations between its collective motion and the pheromone marking. It is, of course, interesting to understand how these relate to the single ant level. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper, below, we provide some hypotheses and directions for future research. One aspect of this concerns the mechanism by which individuals decide to lay scent marks. Such decisions may involve the ant's general knowledge of the environment (<a href=\"#bib21\">Collett and Collett, 2002</a>), her recent history (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wystrach et al., 2013</a>), and her interaction with obstacles or passageways. The differences in scent mark laying behavior according to the large-scale structure of an obstacle, as presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, suggest an experimental scheme for testing the interplay between these factors. The decision when and where to lay scent marks may further be influenced by the presence of previously laid pheromones. Note however, that a positive feedback between marking and further marking is not required for the cohesiveness of the trail itself; Marks may be in close proximity simply because they all originate at the load and point in roughly the same direction (towards the nest). This may break down in the presence of obstacles where several alternative routes to the nest are available. Indeed, in this case, we observe that not all scent marks agree in their direction (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) such that no strict consensus is enforced. Importantly, such lack of consensus does not hold significant implications to our theoretical analysis (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary\u00a0file\u00a01-1</a>)."

Under this hypothesis, the response of the carrying group to the scent marks is not direct but, rather, mediated by these newly attached ants. Verifying this hypothesis is the subject of future work."

We observed that marking bout distances can vary between several meters (<i>e.g.</i> for the recruiting ant) and several centimeters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To measure the distribution of bout lengths, we used a Disto-D3 distance meter (Leica Geosystems;\u00a0Heerbrugg,\u00a0Switzerland). Ants were induced to carry an object at distances of 5\u20137 m from the nest during which we identified ants that commence marking near the object (this is justified by our measurement indicating that marking bouts commence in the close proximity of the carried load\u00a0<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>,). A person holding the distance meter marked the location of the object at the beginning of the bout using a small marker while a second person tracked the marking ant. Once the ant marks the furthest mark from the load, a distance measurement was taken. Note that using video techniques to track fast moving 3 mm ants over many meters in the field is impractical."

While it is always difficult to relate complex biological parameters to abstract model parameters, this would at least provide some feedback from the model back to learning new biology. Moreover, the model assumes parameters values are fixed, but the data seem to suggests that ants likely change their behavior when an obstacle is reached, preferring to explore more.

Intriguingly, the trail is characterized by traits that at first glance appear to be counterproductive to the ants\u2019 navigational effort. These include the repeated instances in which the group completely loses what may be a perfectly good trail and the very short local and segmented pheromonal marking. The purpose of the model we present is not to accurately describe the ants' navigational mechanisms but, rather, to capture the governing principles of the locally-blazed trail and highlight the computational advantages of its counter-intuitive traits. As such, the model makes some general qualitative predictions regarding the locally blazed trail which we have experimentally tested, these are predictions A-B listed below. We further use new measurements to quantitatively test a new model prediction (see prediction C below).

The single most important prediction of our model is that the locally-blazed trail will enable the ants linear scaling of travel times even in the presence of misleading information. This qualitative prediction of the abstract and therefore general probabilistic following model provides intuition to the counterintuitive aspects of the ants\u2019 trail laying as outlined above. The linear time prediction sets a clear, qualitative and therefore major difference between this model and other possible navigational schemes: while a random walk model would yield an inferior, quadratic relation between distance and time and a model of perfect following would yield divergent time, our model predicts that the ants exhibit linear, near-optimal scaling (see also the new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

First, the markings bouts performed by different ants all start from the object itself (see, for example, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This, together with the locality of the markings, provide a mechanism which guarantees that most scent marks are laid in close proximity of each other. Second, ants that are unattached from the carried object are well informed of the direction to the nest. This can be seen, for example, by the recruitment trail of the first ant that finds the food bait whose trajectory back towards the nest is very well aimed. It can also be inferred from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> which exhibits a tight spread of angle of marks around the direction to the nest. This is despite the fact that markings were collected from different distant points along the trail (and are hence inherently independent). Therefore, in the case in which a single shortest path (from the perspective of individual ants) leads from the carried load to the nest, the marks will typically point to it. This, along with the shared bout starting point near the carried load, keeps cohesiveness between marking ants."

When there are multiple pointers at a location the right way to model the fact that ants are typically correct but not always, would be to require that the probability that the strongest advice pointer points to a shortest path is at least some p. This provides a direct translation from this model to the Noisy-Advice model as the strongest directional mark is taken to be the advice at the location, and when running PF, the load only takes into account these pointers. Although it could be the case that all pointers at a given point are taken into consideration, we view the model that considers only the strongest pointer, as a first order approximation, which already demonstrates the basic properties of the navigation mechanism. Constructing a theoretical model that takes into account all pointers and balances between their strengths would be possible, but would complicate the presentation considerably, and we further do not believe that it will reveal a new insight that PF doesn't already have.

As seen in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> near the obstacle marking ants tend to mark in a direction that is perpendicular to the original which will not happen as frequently in an open space (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

Moreover, the interactions of the individual ants with the obstacle are not local: <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a> show that whether an ant marks in a particular direction or not has to do with the structure of the obstacle far away from this point. We now explain and mention this in paragraph 12 of the Discussion where studying individual ant marking behavior is presented as a possible extension of this work (with experiments similar to that presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a> serving as a good starting point)."

This supports the claim that the efficiency of the ants\u2019 motion can be attributed to the locally blazed trail. Therefore, without the scent marks, the interaction of the obstacle does not have a major biological significance.
