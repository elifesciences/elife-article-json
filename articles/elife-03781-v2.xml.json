In this study, we show that mice lacking the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R KO mice) manifest greatly reduced FAA, whereas mice lacking the dopamine D2 receptor have normal FAA. To determine where dopamine exerts its effect, we limited expression of dopamine signaling to the dorsal striatum of dopamine-deficient mice; these mice developed FAA. Within the dorsal striatum, the daily rhythm of clock gene <i>period2</i> expression was markedly suppressed in D1R KO mice. Pharmacological activation of D1R at the same time daily was sufficient to establish anticipatory activity in wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that dopamine signaling to D1R-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum plays an important role in manifestation of FAA, possibly by synchronizing circadian oscillators that modulate motivational processes and behavioral output."

In this study, we show that mice lacking the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R KO mice) manifest greatly reduced FAA, whereas mice lacking the dopamine D2 receptor have normal FAA. To determine where dopamine exerts its effect, we limited expression of dopamine signaling to the dorsal striatum of dopamine-deficient mice; these mice developed FAA. Within the dorsal striatum, the daily rhythm of clock gene <i>period2</i> expression was markedly suppressed in D1R KO mice. Pharmacological activation of D1R at the same time daily was sufficient to establish anticipatory activity in wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that dopamine signaling to D1R-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum plays an important role in manifestation of FAA, possibly by synchronizing circadian oscillators that modulate motivational processes and behavioral output."

This disorientating sensation occurs because our brains have \u2018internal clocks\u2019 that keep track of the day\u2013night cycle and control when we feel most tired or most alert. Flying rapidly from one time zone to another causes this clock to fall out of sync with the local time. It then takes time for the brain's clock to slowly adjust by responding to the levels of light and dark in the new environment."

Also, for a few hours before their new feeding time the mice will tend to jump and move around more; this is known as \u2018food anticipatory activity\u2019. Researchers have been studying this activity for around 40 years, but the specific regions of the brain and the processes that support these rhythms of feeding behavior remained unknown."

Neurotransmitters are chemicals that carry signals between neurons; one neuron releases the chemical, and another detects it using proteins on the neuron's surface called receptors. Two main types of receptors\u2014called D1 receptors and D2 receptors\u2014detect dopamine. Gallardo et al. found that D1 receptors are important for maintaining feeding-related daily rhythms, but that D2 receptors are not. Additionally, dopamine only needs to be produced in a region of the brain called the dorsal striatum for food anticipatory activity to occur. This suggests that only D1 receptors in this region influence this activity, though there are many other regions of the brain that contain these receptors."

Which of the D1 receptor expressing neurons relay the information about the timing of food anticipatory behavior and to where? Also, if a similar clock operates in humans, testing to see if it is misregulated in people with eating disorders could help us to better understand these conditions."

Circadian clocks in many tissues, including multiple brain regions outside of the SCN, can also be entrained by daily cycles of food availability, independently of the SCN pacemaker (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stokkan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mistlberger, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Verwey and Amir, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mohawk et al., 2012</a>). In rat and mouse, this is readily demonstrated by restricting food access to the middle of the light period, when nocturnal rodents normally eat little and are inactive. This induces a marked shifting of circadian oscillators and organ functions to align with the new daily feeding time, while the SCN remains coupled to the light-dark (LD) cycle. In many species, this is also associated with the emergence of a daily bout of locomotor activity that anticipates meal time by 1\u20133 hr (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boulos and Terman, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Stephan, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mistlberger, 2011</a>). Remarkably, this so-called food anticipatory activity (FAA) exhibits formal properties of circadian clock control, yet persists robustly after removal of the SCN (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stephan et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boulos and Terman, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Marchant and Mistlberger, 1997</a>). Anticipatory rhythms can also be induced by scheduled daily access to water, salt, palatable foods, an opportunity to mate, and psychostimulant drugs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mistlberger and Rusak, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mistlberger, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kosobud et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Iijima et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mendoza et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Honma and Honma, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Webb et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hsu et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gallardo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jansen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Landry et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mohawk et al., 2013</a>). The ability of animals to coordinate activity and physiology with access to critical resources is obviously adaptive. Similar circadian processes in humans could create daily windows of vulnerability to drug seeking, overeating, and other addictive behaviors."

                        "text": "A major knowledge gap in circadian neurobiology is the location of circadian oscillators that generate food (and other reward) anticipatory circadian rhythms. The stimuli and neural pathways that entrain these oscillators also remain unspecified. Conventional lesion experiments have ruled out a number of brain regions as the site of circadian oscillators necessary for FAA (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mistlberger, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Davidson, 2009</a>). This includes the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, an area that may nonetheless participate in the expression of daytime FAA by inhibiting output from the SCN pacemaker that normally opposes activity and promotes rest during the day in nocturnal rodents (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acosta-Galvan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Landry et al., 2011</a>). Induction of anticipatory rhythms by a range of ingestive and non-ingestive reward stimuli suggest that activation of reward circuits in the brain may play a role, perhaps as a final common entrainment pathway. This is supported by evidence that circadian clock genes exhibit daily rhythms of expression in components of the reward system, including the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wakamatsu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Angeles-Castellanos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Verwey and Amir, 2011</a>). These rhythms are inverted by daytime feeding, and, in the dorsal striatum, can be induced or reset by dopaminergic stimuli (<a href=\"#bib24\">Iijima et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hood et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Natsubori et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2014</a>). Importantly, FAA rhythms can be shifted by a single injection of a dopamine D2 receptor agonist (<a href=\"#bib52\">Smit et al., 2013</a>) and can be attenuated by dopamine D1 and D2 antagonists (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). In addition, genetic deletion of factors that activate dopamine transmission (e.g., ghrelin receptors) can attenuate FAA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">LeSauter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lamont et al., 2012</a>), but see (<a href=\"#bib59\">Szentirmai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gunapala et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Patton et al., 2013</a>) while deletion of factors that suppress DA transmission (e.g., leptin and 5HT1c receptors) can increase FAA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mistlberger and Marchant, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hsu et al., 2010c</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ribeiro et al., 2011</a>). Lesion experiments rule out the nucleus accumbens as the site of dopamine receptors that might be necessary for FAA (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mistlberger and Mumby, 1992</a>), but comparable experiments of the dorsal striatum have not been reported."

We further show that a D1 receptor agonist administered once daily in the light period can induce an anticipatory rhythm. Analyses of total daily activity, FAA as a proportion of daily activity, body temperature, and striatal clock gene expression suggest that the FAA phenotype of D1R KO mice may involve impaired synchronization of food-entrainable oscillators combined with an alteration in the strategy for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, favoring reduced total daily activity over nocturnal hypothermia."

First, we investigated whether mice lacking D2R (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kelly et al., 1997</a>) showed impairments in FAA. We measured the baseline home-cage behavior using automated video-based behavior analysis (<a href=\"#bib53\">Steele et al., 2007</a>) of D2R KO mice and wild-type (WT) littermates in their home-cage environment. Prior to any dietary intervention (\u2018day -7\u2019), both groups of mice demonstrated normal nocturnal activity waveforms with no significant differences in any 1-hr bin and no increase in activity in the hours before Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 8 (on a 13:11 LD cycle, ZT 12 is lights-off by convention) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Next, we tested their ability to time a daily 60% CR meal fed at ZT 8 every day for 28 days, recording their behavior weekly. Data were normalized by dividing the amount of high activity behavior in each hour by the total seconds of activity over the 24 hr video recording to express a fraction of high activity per hour. Measurements taken at 14, 21, and 28 days of CR revealed that both WT and D2R KO mice had a large increase in high activity (hanging, jumping, walking, and rearing) behaviors during the 3 hr preceding feeding time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). In both D2R KO and WT mice fed 60% CR daily, we observed similar acquisition and maintenance of FAA defined as normalized high activity in the 3 hr before feeding (ZT 5\u20138) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). As expected, mice of either genotype with ad libitum (AL) access to food showed very little high activity behavior in the hours preceding scheduled feeding when they were given an additional food pellet as a control for handling and disturbance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These results suggest that D2R is not necessary for mediating FAA on a 60% CR meal."

Based on our prior work demonstrating that fatty foods are more potent inducers of FAA in mice than sugary foods (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hsu et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gallardo et al., 2012</a>), we tested whether D1R KO mice would show FAA for a 60% CR diet consisting of a more palatable, fat-rich diet. We fed D1R KO and WT controls a 60% CR diet of \u2018breeder\u2019 chow (5015 mouse diet; LabDiet), which has 25.3% calories from fat (5001 rodent chow has 13.5% calories from fat) at ZT 8 daily. D1R KO mice failed to show FAA for breeder chow, exerting only 4\u20138% of their total daily high activity behaviors in the 3 hr preceding scheduled meal time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>). Interestingly, although WT mice showed FAA for breeder chow, it was attenuated compared to that observed with standard chow, as WT mice redistributed only \u223c20% of high activity behaviors to the 3 hr preceding feeding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>) compared to 30\u201340% on standard chow (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We also tested an even higher fat content chow, rodent \u2018high fat diet\u2019 (HFD), in which 60% of the calories come from fat. A 60% CR diet of HFD fed once daily at ZT 8 failed to induce FAA in D1R KO mice and induced a very modest FAA in WT controls, which allocated only about 10% of total high activity behaviors to the 3 hr preceding meal time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>).

To address this issue, we employed an alternative assay for relating hunger status to activity levels by acutely fasting D1R KO and control mice. In previous studies of the home-cage behavioral response to acute fasting in WT C57BL/6J mice, mice increased their high-activity behaviors two-fold upon acute fasting as compared to AL food access (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gallardo et al., 2014</a>). We measured the total high-activity behavior of D1R KO and WT controls over a 3-day period. During days 1 and 2, all mice had AL access to standard chow. As expected, D1R WT and D1R KO mice showed similar median levels of high activity behaviors over 3 days of AL diet (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). On the third day, mice were either maintained on an AL diet or had their food removed entirely (\u2018fasted\u2019). D1R KO mice showed a strong increase in high-activity behaviors upon acute food deprivation, increasing their activity to a greater extent than fasted WT mice, with mean values of 270.5 min and 376.9 min of high activity, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To normalize these data, we plotted the ratio of activity on fasting day 3 over that of AL day 2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This ratio is expected to be around one for mice that were not food deprived, in that the activity of an individual mouse should not vary much from day-to-day. Indeed, the amount of high activity on day 2 vs day 3 was close to one for both D1R WT (0.96) and D1R KO mice (0.92) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, when food deprived, WT mice had an activity ratio of 1.9 and D1R KO mice had a ratio of 2.5 (both of which were statistically significant when compared within genotype to AL, p &lt; 0.01 Mann\u2013Whitney). Importantly, this assay does not measure food timing, as these mice were naive to any feeding schedule. These results suggest that the D1R KO mice are capable of up-regulating activity in response to acute food deprivation (i.e., hunger), demonstrating an intact circuitry of detecting and responding to fasting and thus ruling out gross metabolic defects."

We expected that this \u2018cue\u2019 would alert D1R KO mice and perhaps facilitate FAA. We cued D1R WT and KO mice on an AL diet to assay the amount of activity that occurs as the result of a disturbance independent of FAA. We observed a small increase in high activity behaviors lasting only 10 min post-cue in both D1R WT and D1R KO mice; there were no significant differences in the amount of activity induced in D1R WT and KO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). D1R KO mice on a CR diet did not show a sustained increase in activity after being cued to feeding time; their activity lasted only \u223c10 min subsequent to the cue (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). WT control mice on a CR diet showed a large increase in activity induced by the cue, or were already demonstrating FAA at the time of the cue, and sustained their increased activity for the following 2 hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Summation of the time of high-activity behavior 2 hr prior to feeding demonstrated a significant increase in activity in WT mice when CR compared to AL feeding, but not in D1R KO mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These results suggest that even cuing the D1R KO mice to the subsequent availability of food did not trigger FAA behaviors."

To gain further insight into the role of the dopaminergic system in FAA, we next studied FAA in response to scheduled palatable meals.

Given how poorly D1R KO mice expressed FAA for 60% CR meals, it is surprising that daily HFD meals elicited even modest FAA, leading us to retest FAA for 60% CR meals in the same cohort of mice."

Then, we changed their diet to a daily scheduled 60% CR meal consisting of standard chow at ZT 9 on day 22. On the first day of 60% CR, we did not observe any differences in behavior between D1R KO and control mice as neither group showed FAA, as expected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). However, after just 1 week (\u2018day 28\u2019) of 60% CR, the D1R KO mice that had previously been treated with HFD showed marked FAA for their daily feeding, with a notable FAA peak that was as high as the night time activity peak (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). There was no significant difference between the amount of FAA exhibited between D1R KO and WT mice on day 28 (p = 0.734, Mann\u2013Whitney). Remarkably, by the 14th day of 60% CR (\u2018day 35\u2019 of the experiment), the D1R KO mice no longer showed FAA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,G</a>) and the difference with control mice was highly significant (p = 0.0003, Mann\u2013Whitney). This lack of FAA in D1R KO mice persisted through days 42 and 49, whereas control mice maintained on a CR diet continued to express robust FAA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>). We performed a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test to determine whether there were significant within-genotype variations in this experiment and found that WT mice showed significant differences between FAA observed at day 22 and days 28, 35, 42, and 49, whereas D1R KO mice only showed significant differences in FAA between day 22 and day 28 but not any other day, indicating that the D1R KO mice transiently up-regulate FAA whereas control mice sustain this increase.

The 24-hr body temperature profiles showed identical waveforms for WT and KO groups before CR schedules were started (\u2018day -3\u2019) with temperatures remaining close to 34.5\u00b0C during the daytime and increasing to up to \u223c36\u00b0C at night-time (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). By day 14 of CR, there was a similar redistribution of mean temperature waveforms in both D1R KO and WT mice, starting with a slightly elevated postprandial temperatures and steady temperature declines in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 19) that continues until about 6 hr before expected meal time (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Despite similar profiles in temperature waveforms, we did note that D1R KO mice tended to show a slightly higher temperature during the entirety of the dark cycle compared to WT controls during CR (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We tested for an effect of genotype and day of measurement on nocturnal temperature, finding that there were no statistically significant differences between D1R WT and KO (genotype accounts for 5.63% of the total variance; F = 1.15; p = 0.3044) but there was a significant effect of day of experiment (interaction accounts for 4.43% of the total variance; F = 4.53; p = 0.0001; 2-way repeated measures ANOVA). However, there was no significant difference in average temperatures between D1R KO and controls during the 3 hr preceding feeding at any point during the experiment (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). We also examined the fluctuation in temperature, \u2018the \u0394T\u2019, in the 3 hr preceding meal time by subtracting the maximum and minimum temperature values within the FAA window (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). By this metric, D1R KO and WT mice show increasing \u0394T following the start of CR feeding schedules with values peaking by day 7 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). The D1R KO mice had a similar \u0394T to control at all times except for days 14 and 17, where this difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05, day 17). Given that the \u0394T is similar again by day 21, we conclude that overall there are subtle differences in temperature entrainment in D1R KO mice but that overall their metabolism is effectively modulated by CR feeding; importantly, they do not fail to show FAA due to entering a torpor state."

In this system, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), has a \u2018lox-stop-lox\u2019 cassette within the first intron of the <i>Th</i> gene and does not make any dopamine (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhou and Palmiter, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 1995</a>). This lox-stop-lox cassette can be removed by the action of Cre-recombinase, allowing for region specific re-activation of this allele (<a href=\"#bib57\">Szczypka et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hnasko et al., 2006</a>). Cre-recombinase was encoded in canine adenovirus (CAV), which infects neuronal terminals and undergoes retrograde transport. CAV-inoculated mice showed expression of dopamine restricted to neurons that innervate the dorsolateral striatum (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). Quantitative analysis of the TH straining revealed a significant difference in restoration when comparing dorsal vs ventral striatum or anterior commissure (aca), which is always devoid of TH staining (p = 0.018, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test; p = 0.0486 comparing dorsal vs ventral, p = 0.0112 for dorsal vs aca, and p = 0.999 for ventral vs aca, Dunn's post-test for multiple comparisons). To these virally rescued DD mice (DD-VR), or controls (WT mice injected with virus), we presented a 60% CR meal at ZT 9 for 21 days. Initially the activity waveforms of the DD-VR mice showed a trend toward increased activity at night (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>), and they did not show appreciable FAA at the 7-day-time point (p &lt; 0.05) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). However, by day 14 and onwards they showed a strong FAA response, eventually having almost all of their daily activity preceding meal time as did sham surgery controls (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). From this experiment we conclude that dopamine signaling in the dorsal striatum is sufficient for acquisition of FAA."

A core loop is comprised of the clock genes <i>Per1, Per2, Cry1,</i> and <i>Cry2</i>, which are positively regulated by heterodimers of BMAL1 and CLOCK and negatively regulated by hetero- and homodimers of PER and CRY proteins. Circadian clock genes exhibit 24-hr rhythms of expression in the dorsal striatum (<a href=\"#bib16\">Harbour et al., 2013</a>), and these rhythms can be shifted by daytime feeding schedules (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wakamatsu et al., 2001</a>) and dopamine agonists (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hood et al., 2010</a>). If attenuation of FAA rhythms in D1R KO mice is due to impaired entrainment of circadian oscillators in the dorsal striatum, then daily rhythms of clock gene expression in food-restricted D1R KO mice should be significantly attenuated or differently phased relative to WT mice. WT and KO mice were fed regular chow once daily in the light period (ZT 6\u201310) for at least 30 days and were then euthanized at 1 of 4 time points (ZT 0, 6, 12, 18) for quantification of <i>Per2</i> expression by quantitative, reverse-transcriptase PCR. A 2-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of time of day (F<sub>(4,30)</sub> = 5.07, p = 0.0031), genotype (F<sub>(1,30)</sub> = 10.08, p = 0035), and interaction (F<sub>(4,30)</sub> = 22.02, p &lt; 0.0001) in <i>Per2</i> expression. WT mice exhibited a 24-hr rhythm with peak expression at ZT 12 (lights-off), which is advanced by comparison with the daily rhythm previously reported in AL fed rodents (e.g., <a href=\"#bib16\">Harbour et al., 2013</a>). KO mice exhibited a markedly attenuated daily rhythm of striatal <i>Per2</i> expression, due primarily to reduced expression at ZT 12 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). These results permit a substantive conclusion that the daily rhythm of <i>Per2</i> expression evident in the dorsal striatum of WT mice anticipating a daily meal is dependent on dopamine signaling at D1 receptors."

We injected WT C57BL/6J male mice daily intraperitoneally with D1R agonist SKF-81297 for 12 days (see top panel in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). As controls, we injected additional mice daily with either water as a negative control for IP injection or caffeine as a negative control for activation of the locomotor system, since caffeine induces hyperactivity even in dopamine-deficient mice it is a dopamine-independent pathway (<a href=\"#bib26\">Joyce and Koob, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim and Palmiter, 2003</a>). The immediate response to injection was observed as an increase in activity in caffeine and SKF-81297 mice that was more prolonged than that of water-injected controls (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>). This trend continued through day 12, where water-injected mice showed a habituation to injection but caffeine-injected mice showed increased activity (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). On day 13, when no injection was performed, leaving all mice undisturbed (no cage changes), the SKF-injected mice showed increased activity compared to both water and caffeine-injected controls during the 3 hr after scheduled injection (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>). We examined mice at days 0, 7, 12, and 13 for evidence of behavioral entrainment to injection. On day 0, there was no increase in activity preceding daily injection, as expected (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12D</a>).

By days 12 and 13, the fraction of high activity of SKF-injected mice was significantly greater than either that of water- or caffeine-injected mice (day 12, SKF-81297 vs water, SKF 81297 vs caffeine [p &lt; 0.01]; day 13, SKF 81297 vs water [p &lt; 0.01], SKF-81297 vs caffeine [p &lt; 0.01]) (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12F\u2013H</a>)."

Localization of these oscillators and their entrainment pathways has been an enduring challenge (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davidson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mistlberger, 2011</a>). Recent studies suggest a role for dopamine signaling in the expression and timing of food anticipatory rhythms in mice and rats (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Smit et al., 2013</a>). In this study, we provide comprehensive evidence supporting an important role for dopamine signaling via D1R in the expression of FAA in CR mice fed in the light period. Using video-based automated behavior analysis, motion sensors, and running discs, we demonstrated that anticipation of a daily meal is markedly attenuated in mice lacking D1R. By contrast, it is normal in mice lacking D2R and in dopamine-deficient mice with local production of dopamine in the dorsal striatum. The reduction in FAA in D1R KO mice is evident both in total counts and when normalized for total daily activity. We propose that attenuated FAA in D1R KO mice may involve three distinct processes; circadian oscillator entrainment, incentive motivation, and metabolic homeostasis."

Mammalian circadian clocks are comprised of populations of coupled circadian oscillators (clock cells) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Colwell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mohawk and Takahashi, 2011</a>). Disruption of coupling within a population of circadian oscillators can flatten aggregate clock output and attenuate rhythm peaks. A circadian oscillator entrainment interpretation of attenuated FAA in D1R KO mice is suggested by two observations. First, in parallel with attenuated FAA rhythms, D1R KO mice also exhibited a marked attenuation of a daily rhythm of clock gene (<i>Per2</i>) expression in the dorsal striatum. Second, a daily injection of the D1 agonist SKF-81257 was sufficient to induce a rhythm of anticipatory activity that was synchronized to the injection time and that persisted during a withdrawal day. These results converge on a hypothesis that dopamine signaling via D1R in the dorsal striatum entrains circadian oscillators that regulate the timing and amplitude of FAA. We speculate that a daily rhythm of dopamine release associated with food acquisition serves to coordinate the phase of circadian clock cells in the dorsal striatum, and that genetic deletion of D1R impairs this function, thereby reducing the amplitude of the population rhythm and the magnitude of the activity rhythm driven by these oscillators. In this respect, D1R signaling in food-entrainable oscillators of the dorsal striatum may be analogous to VPAC receptor signaling in the SCN, which is critical for coupling the population of circadian oscillators that constitute this light entrained circadian pacemaker (<a href=\"#bib17\">Harmar et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aton et al., 2005</a>)."

Circadian clocks also generate internal time cues that animals can use to discriminate time of day; for example, to permit daily time-place learning, or time-compensated-sun-compass orientation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mistlberger, 1994</a>). A representation of circadian clock phase, by repeated association with a fixed daily meal time, could acquire salience as an incentive stimulus and generate a daily rhythm of incentive motivation manifest as FAA. Such a model could account for the ability of some animals to anticipate two or more meal times per day (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biebach et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Van der Zee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Luby et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mistlberger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mulder et al., 2013</a>). It is therefore possible that attenuated FAA in D1R KO mice, which did not express FAA even when aroused 2 hr prior to meal time (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), reflects impaired incentive motivation, due to a failure to attribute incentive salience to representations of circadian phase, due to degradation of the clock signals by striatal oscillator damping, or both."

Furthermore, upon transfer to the CR schedule, the KO mice showed a transient FAA that dissipated over the course of the first week. These observations suggest that enhanced palatability can compensate for deficits in oscillator entrainment or incentive motivation, but that this effect is masked by CR. We speculate that the activity phenotype in D1R KO mice reflects an additional metabolic factor. Although D1R KO mice, like WT mice, exhibited hyperactivity during acute food deprivation they were significantly less active throughout the day and night during the chronic CR schedules. This was not due to metabolic collapse, given that during chronic restriction, D1R KO mice maintained nocturnal body temperatures relative to WT mice, which were hypothermic at night and early in the light period. These results suggest a different strategy used by WT and KO mice to maintain metabolic homeostasis during CR. The WT mice may conserve energy by reducing metabolism at night and expend energy by raising body temperature and locomotor activity in anticipation of a regular daily meal time. The KO mice, by contrast, switch from an initial hyperactivity to a long-term hypoactivity of sufficient magnitude to support a more normal body temperature despite restricted calorie intake. This strategy results in low levels of activity both at night and prior to meal time. Nonetheless, the reduction in FAA is significant even when normalized against total daily activity. Thus, the food anticipation phenotype in CR D1R KO mice may be explained by an alteration in the strategy to maintain metabolic homeostasis, which damps activity non-specifically throughout the 24-hr cycle and an impairment in circadian entrainment and/or incentive motivation processes that results in a disproportionate reduction of activity in anticipation of meal time."

Feeding schedules entrain circadian oscillators in many body tissues and brain regions. There is at present no direct evidence for a master food-entrainable pacemaker analogous to the retinorecipient light-entrainable pacemaker in the SCN, which in mammals is indispensible for entrainment to light:dark cycles. Indeed hypophysectomy eliminates preprandial temperature increases but not FAA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Davidson and Stephan, 1999</a>), a dissociation that we have also observed with mice showing temperature entrainment without FAA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gallardo et al., 2012</a>) and mice showing FAA without showing preprandial temperature increases (<a href=\"#bib35\">Luby et al., 2012</a>). Food entrainment may involve multiple parallel entrainment pathways, acting on a fully distributed, non-hierarchical system of circadian oscillators in local circuits, each responsible for generating food-entrained rhythms in tissue specific functions. The differential effect of the D1R KO on behavior and body temperature is consistent with this model."

Total injection volumes were approximately 250 \u00b5l per mouse. For the mice in <a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, we decreased the dose of SKF-81297 to 3 mg/kg due to seizures induced by the drug. c-Fos staining was done as described previously (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gallardo et al., 2014</a>)."

Tissue was rapidly extracted, frozen on dry ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA extraction. Tissue samples were later mechanically homogenized and RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's specifications. RNA concentrations were obtained using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and concentrations were adjusted to 50 ng/\u00b5l. cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng RNA using High Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). Real-time PCR was performed using 2 \u00b5l cDNA with SYBR Green FastMix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) in a Step-One real time PCR system (Life Technologies). Gene expression was normalized to total RNA input. Primers used for PCR were as follows: <i>Per2 forward: ACCTCCCTGCAGACAAGAA, Per2 reverse: CTCATTAGCCTTCACCTGCTT</i>."

This phenomenon has been investigated for many years and has been a very difficult to understand mechanistically due to the fact that there are many extrinsic and intrinsic variables that animals integrate in making behavioral decisions. The authors do an excellent job of investigating what are probably the most important variables and come up with a very convincing story about DA in the striatum being the driver of the relevant peripheral oscillator. I think that this paper, because it answers a very long-standing question in a rigorous manner is an important contribution."

In this study, the authors show that D1R KO mice do not show much FAA while the D2R KO mice have normal FAA. In an important advance, the authors report that use of a viral construct to express DA in the dorsal striatum of dopamine-deficient mice allows these mice to develop FAA. Finally, the administration of D1 agonist itself is sufficient to establish anticipatory activity in wild-type mice."

ZT5-7 is, by definition, 2h-ZT5:00-ZT7:00.

We apologize for this error and have made the appropriate corrections in the revised manuscript. 2) The other reason for differences in feeding times was a result of the experiments being conducted over a 4+ year period in 5 separate laboratory settings (Caltech, Simon Fraser, Keck Science Department, UWash, and Cal Poly Pomona). For example, at some institutions the light:dark cycle was 13:11 and at others 12:12. For FAA studies mice were fed consistently during the middle-to-late portion of the light cycle and the range was different by only 3 hours; all mice were fed between ZT6 and ZT8 for our study. A great many restricted daytime feeding experiments have been done over the past \u223c40 years, and these studies show that the parameters of food anticipatory activity (most importantly, its duration and amplitude) vary little or not at all with the time within the light period when the mealtime is initiated. In our experiments the mealtimes are consistent within experiments, which is the only methodological factor that is critical for interpreting differences between WT and KO mice. In fact, the variability of mealtimes across experiments can be viewed as a strength of the study, because we consistently observed the deficit in food anticipatory activity in caloric restriction experiments regardless of when the daily meal started in a particular experiment."
