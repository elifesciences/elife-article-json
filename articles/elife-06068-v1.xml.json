                    "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a highly prevalent pathogen that induces life-long infections notably through the establishment of latency in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Bouts of reactivation are normally controlled by the immune system, but can be fatal in immuno-compromised individuals such as organ transplant recipients. Here, we reveal that HCMV latency in human CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC reflects the recruitment on the viral genome of KAP1, a master co-repressor, together with HP1 and the SETDB1 histone methyltransferase, which results in transcriptional silencing. During lytic infection, KAP1 is still associated with the viral genome, but its heterochromatin-inducing activity is suppressed by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation. Correspondingly, HCMV can be forced out of latency by KAP1 knockdown or pharmacological induction of KAP1 phosphorylation, and this process can be potentiated by activating NFkB with TNF-\u03b1. These results suggest new approaches both to curtail CMV infection and to purge the virus from organ transplants."

Bouts of reactivation are normally controlled by the immune system, but can be fatal in immuno-compromised individuals such as organ transplant recipients. Here, we reveal that HCMV latency in human CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC reflects the recruitment on the viral genome of KAP1, a master co-repressor, together with HP1 and the SETDB1 histone methyltransferase, which results in transcriptional silencing. During lytic infection, KAP1 is still associated with the viral genome, but its heterochromatin-inducing activity is suppressed by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation. Correspondingly, HCMV can be forced out of latency by KAP1 knockdown or pharmacological induction of KAP1 phosphorylation, and this process can be potentiated by activating NFkB with TNF-\u03b1. These results suggest new approaches both to curtail CMV infection and to purge the virus from organ transplants."

These yield the effectors of viral genome replication, before proteins encoded by the viral late (L) genes finally trigger the formation of new particles. In contrast, when HCMV infects a HSC, the expression of lytic genes is rapidly suppressed and only a few latency-associated transcripts are detected (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goodrum et al., 2012</a>). The viral genome is then maintained as a stable episome, without replicating or producing new virions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goodrum et al., 2004</a>).

KAP1 binds to the Kr\u00fcppel-associated box (KRAB) domain present at the N-terminus of KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Friedman et al., 1996</a>). These constitute the single largest family of transcriptional repressors encoded by the genomes of higher organisms, with close to four-hundred members in either human or mouse, and are endowed with sequence-specific DNA binding ability via a C-terminal array of zinc fingers (<a href=\"#bib58\">Urrutia, 2003</a>). KAP1 harbors from its N- to its C-terminus a RING finger, B-boxes, a coiled-coil region, a HP1-binding motif, a PHD finger and a bromodomain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Iyengar and Farnham, 2011</a>). The first three of these motifs define the so-called RBCC or TRIM (tripartite motif) region, which is both necessary and sufficient for homo-oligomerization and direct binding to KRAB. The C-terminal effector end of the protein recognizes the backbone of histone tails, and interacts with two histone-modifying enzymes: Mi2\u03b1, an isoform of the Mi2 protein found in the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation) complex (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schultz et al., 2001</a>), and SETDB1 (SET domain, bifurcated 1), an H3K9me3-specific histone methyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schultz et al., 2002</a>). The H3K9me3 mark in turn creates high affinity genomic binding sites for HP1, bringing more KAP1 complex, which likely explains that KAP1-induced heterochromatin formation can spread several tens of kilobases away from an initial KAP1 docking site (<a href=\"#bib20\">Groner et al., 2010</a>). SETDB1 recruitment is stimulated by sumoylation of the KAP1 bromodomain, the last step of which is mediated intra-molecularly by an E3 ligase activity contained in the PHD domain (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ivanov et al., 2007</a>). Within the context of DNA damage, the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase phosphorylates KAP1 at position 824, resulting in decreased KAP1 sumoylation and SETDB1 recruitment, with secondary loss of KAP1 repressor activity (<a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Noon et al., 2010</a>)."

Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that KRAB/KAP-mediated repression is functional within the context of episomal DNA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barde et al., 2009</a>). Finally, the KRAB/KAP pathway has been found to influence the replication of two members of the herpes virus family, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liao et al., 2005</a>) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cai et al., 2013</a>). Based on these premises, we investigated a possible role for KAP1 in the control of HCMV latency. We found that KAP1 is a key mediator of this process, and that it is targeted by an mTOR-mediated phosphorylation switch that can be exploited to force the virus out of latency. Our results suggest new avenues not only for controlling HCMV infection but also for purging the virus from organ transplants."

Monitoring the levels of viral DNA and various RNA transcripts during the following days confirmed that lytic replication occurred in MRC5 cells, known to be fully permissive, whereas latency was established in HSC after an initial outburst of viral gene expression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goodrum et al., 2007</a>). To examine the possible impact of KAP1 on this process, we depleted the corepressor by lentivector-mediated RNA interference, complementing <i>Kap1</i> knockdown cells by transduction with a vector expressing an shRNA-resistant <i>Kap1</i> allele when relevant. We then infected these cells with TB40-E HCMV. In MRC5 cells, where KAP1 depletion was around 98% (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), levels of viral transcripts indicative of a lytic cycle (the IE genes UL123, UL122, the E gene UL54 and the L gene UL94) were comparable in control and KAP1-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and production of viral proteins IE1 and IE2 was unchanged (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), indicating that the regulator is not essential for productive HCMV replication. In unsorted population of HSC exposed to the knockdown lentivector, KAP1 reduction was only 85% but in sorted CD34<sup>+</sup> GFP-positive, that is, transduced cells, it reached 95% (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). In this KAP1-depleted subpopulation, expression of immediate early, early and late viral genes at 7 days post-infection was increased between 10- and 35-fold compared with control cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and massive amounts of infectious HCMV particles were released in the supernatant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Furthermore, complementation of KAP1-depleted cells with an shRNA-resistant <i>Kap1</i> allele restored HCMV latency (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013I</a>). These results thus indicated that KAP1 is necessary for the establishment of HCMV latency in HSC. We then inverted the sequence of our manipulations to induce <i>Kap1</i> knockdown in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells that had been infected 7 days earlier with the TB40-E virus (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2J</a>). 7 days after transduction, we measured the expression of the UL122, UL123, UL54 and UL94 mRNAs, which are found only during a lytic cycle (<a href=\"#bib39\">Reeves and Sinclair, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). All transcripts were significantly upregulated in knockdown cells, which accordingly released infectious viral particles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Furthermore, the NF-\u03baB activator TNF\u03b1 increased viral gene expression and virion production from <i>Kap1</i> knockdown but not from control TB40-E-infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). These data indicate that (i) KAP1 is necessary both for the establishment and for the maintenance of HCMV latency in human HSC, and (ii) the relief of KAP1-mediated repression is not in itself sufficient for full HCMV reactivation in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, but provides the ground for stimulation of viral gene expression by HCMV activators such as NF-\u03baB."

Still, as KAP1 exerts pleomorphic effect on hematopoiesis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barde et al., 2013</a>), we could not exclude that its depletion induced HCMV lytic genes expression through indirect effects. We thus asked whether the co-repressor associates with the HCMV genome by performing KAP1-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation-deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses on material isolated from human CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC at 7 days post-TB40-E infection. Using a stringent peak-calling algorithm and validating its results by ChIP-PCR, we identified 28 major KAP1-enriched regions on the HCMV genome (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Supporting the functional significance of KAP1 recruitment to latent HCMV genomes, ChIP-PCR analyses also detected SETDB1, H3K9me3 and HP1\u03b1 at these KAP1-enriched regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, in line with our former demonstration that heterochromatin formation can spread several tens of kilobases away from primary KAP1 docking sites (<a href=\"#bib20\">Groner et al., 2010</a>), H3K9me3 and HP1\u03b1 were found at significant distances from these major KAP1 peaks, and particularly covered the major immediate early promoter (MIEP), the viral origin of lytic replication (OriLyt) and the UL112 gene. In contrast, the repressive mark was not found at genes known to be expressed during latency such as UL138 or LUNA (<a href=\"#bib39\">Reeves and Sinclair, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Importantly, SETDB1 and HP1\u03b1 recruitment as well as H3K9 trimethylation were lost when KAP1 was depleted by RNA interference prior to HSC infection, supporting a model whereby the corepressor recruits these heterochromatin-inducing factors (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>)."

As expected, the TB40-E DNA was no longer associated with SETDB1 or HP1\u03b1 and did not bear the H3K9me3 repressive mark in the CD34-derived mDCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, KAP1 was surprisingly still associated with the viral genome in these targets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The same pattern was recorded in TB40-E infected MRC-5 cells, where the virus achieves a complete lytic cycle (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). It suggested that HCMV reactivation and replication could occur in spite of corepressor binding. To probe this issue further, we infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood and MRC5 cells with the HCMV AD169 laboratory strain, which is incapable of inducing latency (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goodrum et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Saffert et al., 2010</a>). At day 7 post-infection, while the productively transcribed AD169 genome carried as expected neither SETDB1 nor H3K9Me3, it was still bound by KAP1 in both cell types as robustly as the latent TB40-E strain in HSC (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Therefore, it is not KAP1 recognition but rather the secondary recruitment of its SETDB1 effector and other KAP1-associated heterochromatin inducers such as HP1, which is responsible for HCMV latency."

                                "text": "These results suggested that HCMV silencing might be amenable to suppression by pharmacologically induced KAP1 phosphorylation. In the absence of strictly specific mTOR activator, we turned to ATM, a kinase previously demonstrated as capable of phosphorylating KAP1 on S<sup>824</sup> (<a href=\"#bib61\">White et al., 2012</a>). When HSC infected 5 days earlier with TB40-E were incubated with the ATM activator chloroquine (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</a>), intracellular levels of viral RNAs and DNA increased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), and infectious viral particles were released in the supernatant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Supporting the specificity of the observed phenomenon, Torin-1 did not block chloroquine-induced HCMV RNA, DNA and viral particle production, whereas the ATM inhibitor Ku55933 prevented this process (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). These results obtained in a first set of HSC obtained from three donors were confirmed in another group of three donors, where it was further observed that levels of viral transcripts increased in drug-treated cells only transiently after a single dose of drug but steadily if three doses were administered over 5 days (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and that single doses of the ATM activator prevented the progressive drop in viral DNA that was observed in control cells, while repeated doses triggered an augmentation in viral DNA copies, indicative of genome replication (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Correlating these quantitative virological data, chloroquine treatment allowed the detection by immunofluorescence of pS<sup>824</sup>KAP1-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These were also systematically positive for IE antigens (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), confirming that the virus harbored by these cells had exited latency. Finally, when the supernatant of TB40-E-infected HSC exposed to chloroquine was used to inoculate MRC5 fibroblasts, it induced the accumulation of viral DNA in these targets (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), demonstrating that the production of replication-competent virus had been induced by ATM-activating treatment of the latently infected HSC. Noteworthy, pS<sup>824</sup>KAP1 was detected only in HCMV IE-positive cells, which strongly suggests that KAP1 became phosphorylated in these cells through the combined action of ATM and some HCMV-encoded factor. Importantly, these effects were induced without drop in KAP1 levels or loss of surface expression of the CD34 stem cell marker (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Additional evidence strongly suggested that chloroquine stimulated HCMV via KAP1 phosphorylation. First, the drug did not further boost TB40-E in MRC-5 cells, where viral replication is KAP1-insensitive (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). Second, it did not further stimulate HCMV gene expression and virion release in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells depleted for KAP1, whether or not these were complemented with a phosphorylation resistant S<sup>824</sup>A KAP1 mutant (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4AB</a>). Third, and by contrast, chloroquine did reactivate HCMV when these knockdown cells were complemented with wild-type KAP1 (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>)."

Nevertheless, levels of viral gene expression achieved in this setting remain lower than observed when HCMV-harboring precursors are differentiated into macrophages or mature dendritic cells, where NF-\u03baB has been demonstrated to drive viral transcription. We thus exposed latently infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cells to chloroquine and TNF- \u03b1 (5 ng/ml), either alone or in combination (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). With TNF alone, HCMV transcription was not induced, indicating that the virus remained latent. With chloroquine alone, significant induction of cell-associated viral transcripts (approx. 100-fold) and DNA (approx. fivefold) was measured, and viral particles were released in the supernatant (10,000 PFU/ml in the experiment depicted in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). With the further addition of TNF, levels of CMV-specific RNAs increased by another 10-fold, the amounts of cell-associated viral DNA doubled, and virion production was boosted by a factor 10. Importantly, this dual treatment did not trigger the differentiation of the HSC (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, these results suggest a model whereby chloroquine treatment renders the HCMV chromatin permissive for transcription through KAP1 S<sup>824</sup> phosphorylation, which then allows TNF to induce full viral gene expression via NF-kB activation."

Our results correlate with the observation that, in latently infected CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC or circulating monocytes isolated from seropositive individuals, chromatin at the HCMV MIEP bears H3K9me3 and HP1 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sinclair, 2010</a>). Our finding that KAP1 partakes in both the establishment and the maintenance of HCMV latency also corroborates the previously noted absence of more permanent silencing marks, such as DNA methylation, on latent HCMV genomes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hummel et al., 2007</a>). We provide another important clue to the understanding of HCMV biology by revealing that the virus exits latency when KAP1 becomes phosphorylated on serine 824, which blocks its ability to recruit SETDB1 hence abrogates its co-repressor potential. We further identify mTOR as responsible for this KAP1 phosphorylation switch, and capitalizing on these findings we finally demonstrate that HCMV can be forced out of latency by pharmacological activation of ATM, another KAP1 kinase, and that this effect can be potentiated by adding TNF, an inducer of NF-kB. Whether KAP1 phosphorylation relieves HCMV from latency only by dislodging SETDB1 and HP1 from the viral chromatin or through more active mechanisms remains to be determined. Interestingly, a small molecule inhibitor of LSD1/KDM1A was recently found to decrease HCMV immediate early gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liang et al., 2013</a>). It could be that pS<sup>824</sup>KAP1 plays a role in attracting this H3K9 demethylase to the viral genome."

                        "text": "There are remarkable analogies but also interesting differences between our results and recent data implicating KAP1 in the control of KSHV latency (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cai et al., 2013</a>). In cells harboring latent KSHV genomes, KAP1, HP1 and H3K9me3 were enriched at more than two thirds of viral promoters, and KAP1 knockdown reduced these repressive marks and stimulated virus production. Furthermore, upon induction of a lytic cycle by overexpression of the Rta viral transactivator, KAP1 dissociated from the viral genome, resulting in loss of HP1 and H3K9me3. This correlated with phosphorylation of KAP1 on S<sup>824</sup>, apparently mediated by the viral kinase vPK, with reciprocal decrease in the level of KAP1 sumoylation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2009</a>). Here, while we find that a KAP1 phosphorylation switch can also force HCMV out of latency, we demonstrate that, with this virus, the phosphorylated form of the master repressor remains associated with actively transcribed viral genomes. Furthermore, we implicate the cellular kinase mTOR in KAP1 phosphorylation. It was previously noted that both the mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) arms of the mTOR pathway are activated during lytic HCMV replication (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kudchodkar et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2007</a>). This results in phosphorylating notably the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein (4E-BP1) and the p70S6 kinase (S6K), which enhances viral protein translation and more generally minimizes cellular stress responses (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clippinger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Poglitsch et al., 2012</a>). Here, we identify KAP1 as another substrate of this cascade, by observing that (i) the co-repressor is phosphorylated on serine 824 in cells productively infected with HCMV; (ii) this process is inhibited by the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and Torin1; and (iii) mTOR targets the viral chromatin at KAP1-bearing genomic sites during a lytic cycle. Conversely, we could force HCMV out of transcriptional dormancy by inducing the activation of ATM, another kinase targeting KAP1 on serine 824, in latently infected HSC and circulating monocytes. Nevertheless, our data also point to the role of viral factors in targeting this process. First, S<sup>824</sup> phosphoKAP1 was detected only in HCMV IE antigen-positive cells. Second, KAP1 conserved its ability to repress a chromosomal target in cells where its HCMV silencing activity was abrogated by phosphorylation. This strongly suggests that mTOR is targeted to the HCMV genome, where the viral DNA-associated KAP1 molecules are then exposed to its action, a model supported by the results of our mTOR-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation. Such spatial compartmentalization would not be unprecedented, as site-specific KAP1 phosphorylation is also observed in case of DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 2006</a>), and as mTOR has itself been observed to be directed to sites of HCMV assembly (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clippinger and Alwine, 2012</a>). More generally, it will be interesting to ask whether the KRAB/KAP1 pathway contributes to the latency of other herpes viruses, even though in the case of EBV the only evidence available so far is that it instead promotes viral DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liao et al., 2005</a>)."

Our findings thus suggest that, in HSC, a latency-specific gene product counters HCMV-induced mTOR-mediated KAP1 phosphorylation, for instance by either blocking the kinase or by acting as or inducing a KAP1-specific phosphatase. This warrants investigations aimed at elucidating this aspect, and at determining whether, when and, if so, downstream of what pathway mTOR becomes activated and KAP1 phosphorylated during the differentiation of HSC towards macrophages or activated DCs, the cells in which HCMV transcription becomes fully productive."

By analogy, it is tempting to hypothesize that members of the KRAB-ZFP family are also involved in recognizing the HCMV DNA. In support of this model, KAP1 recruitment to the HCMV genome was lost when the KRAB-binding RBCC domain was deleted (not illustrated). Since we detected close to thirty major KAP1 peaks on the HCMV DNA and failed to identify a common motif amongst all these sequences, more than one DNA-binding protein, whether or not KRAB-ZFP, is likely involved in docking the corepressor at these sites. In the case of KSHV, the latency protein LANA is responsible for tethering sumoylated KAP1 and the KAP1-bound Sin3A repressor to the Rta promoter, through its ability to interact with SUMO-2-bearing proteins. Upon hypoxia, KAP1 is de-sumoylated and together with Sin3A is released from the KSHV genome, leading to the activation of the LANA-associated HIF-1\u03b1, the inducible subunit of the hererodimeric HIF-1 (hypoxia-induced factor 1), thus activating viral gene expression (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cai et al., 2013</a>).

The present work indicates that this beneficial effect might stem at least in part from a prevention of viral reactivation. This warrants further studies to assess the positive impact of this and other mTOR inhibitors on the control of HCMV infection, whether after transplantation or in other settings. Of note, a recent study demonstrated that rapamycin did not prevent HCMV reactivation from latently infected dendritic cells in vitro (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glover et al., 2014</a>). However, it could be that KAP1 phosphorylation was already established in this system, and that maturation of the DCs only resulted in activating transcription factors that are strong stimulators of HCMV gene expression, such as NF-\u03baB."

However, the ex vivo treatment of HCMV-positive transplants, for instance bone marrow or HSC purified therefrom, could be readily envisioned to purge latently infected cells prior to engraftment, notably in the high-risk setting of HCMV-negative recipients."

TB40-E infected CD34<sup>+</sup> KAP1-ChIPed DNA was sent to sequencing. The 50 bp reads for KAP1 IP and Total Input were mapped to the HCMV genome (TB40-BAC4 GenBank accession EF999921.1) using the bowtie short read aligner version 0.12.7 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Langmead et al., 2009</a>) and allowing up to three mismatches over the whole length of the read. The signal of the total input was then subtracted from the KAP1 IP signal using a custom made PERL program (see <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Source code 1</a>) and regions with similar signal were merged together. The resulting regions were ranked according to their signal. The signal follows a normal distribution (tested with Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test) thus we considered as enriched regions the extreme right part of the distribution. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE53271 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53271). SYBR green qPCR was performed to quantify enrichment at specific loci. Total Input Fold enrichment was quantified by the classical following calculation: 100 \u00d7 2^\u2212(CT of ChIPed DNA \u2212 CT of Total Input). Cellular promoters regions were used as negative (EVX-1; GAPDH) or positive (ZNF-180; RP11-517P14.7) controls for PCR enrichment. 28 highly enriched peaks were found for the HCMV TB40-E strain, and two negative regions were designed for qPCR controls."

Yet the authors then go on in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1AB</a> to study AD169, 'as a model virus that does not establish latency', and see that KAP1 binds this viral genome just as efficiently as TB40-E in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. The argument is that KAP1 exerts functions via recruitment of secondary modulators (HP1 etc.). This, to me, needs to be explored. For instance, a recent report from the Pari laboratory suggests HCMV encodes a viral RNA that recruits Polycomb repressor complex and H3K27meth marks at the MIEP. Why aren't HP1 etc. recruited? How does KAP1 effect these functions? This seems pivotal for understanding the role of KAP1. Ultimately, what is it about AD169 that negates any activity of KAP1? An alternative explanation could be that the data from analysing TB40-E and AD169 suggests that KAP1 binding to the viral genome is irrelevant and that any KAP1 effects observed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> are indirect due to the multitude effects KAP1 KO would have on other cellular function which then impact on HCMV gene expression."

Some means to block KAP1 recruitment to the viral genome (via sequence mutagenesis) would provide more compelling evidence that KAP1 binding to the viral DNA drives heterochromatic formation at the MIEP. However, this would require identification of the KAP1 binding partner tethering it to the viral DNA. I appreciate the siRNA KO of KAP1 blocks heterochromatic formation at the MIEP but the AD169 observation requires explanation and again suggests that any KAP1 effects could be highly indirect and due to major changes in the cellular biology when knocking out such a key regulator. Again the AD169 data really argues against KAP1 binding being important for controlling latency since KAP1 is recruited to this genome perfectly well but does not provide the same level of control as it apparently does in TB40-E."

The chloroquinone expt (thought to be via KAP1) has only a minor effect on HCMV reactivation and you need subsequent NF-kB stimulation to make it more robust. But they never compare it to DCs directly they just make inference (even DCs given these additional treatments). This would be very interesting and provide a more complete set of data. That aside, is the prediction that if you were to KO KAP1 and see the effect observed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> then the addition of chloroquinone (thought to be active via modulation of KAP1) to KAP1 KO cells should have no incremental impact on HCMV reactivation if the authors predictions are true i.e. if KAP1 mediated repression is deleted by siRNA then any effects of chloroquinone should be abrogated."

I think there has, at least, to be some appreciation that whilst pharmacological modulators of KAP1 could trigger reactivation the data does not state it is the activity of those inhibitors towards KAP1 which is mediating the effect. One would presume ATM promotes phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins but that does not mean they are all involved in HCMV reactivation. The paper sets out to show that KAP1 is the regulator of HCMV latency and reactivation and becomes less and less convincing. If the premise of the paper was chloroquinone and ATM trigger HCMV reactivation and we aim to identify a mechanism it would be more compelling."

ChIP with KAP pS824-specific antibody suggests that phosphorylated KAP is enriched in MRC-5 cells, but not CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. They show that chloroquine treatment induces HCMV reactivation from CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and that this is attenuated by treatment with an ATM inhibitor, but not an inhibitor of mTOR.

How does KAP1 effect these functions? This seems pivotal for understanding the role of KAP1. Ultimately, what is it about AD169 that negates any activity of KAP1?

Some means to block KAP1 recruitment to the viral genome (via sequence mutagenesis) would provide more compelling evidence that KAP1 binding to the viral DNA drives heterochromatic formation at the MIEP. However, this would require identification of the KAP1 binding partner tethering it to the viral DNA. I appreciate the siRNA KO of KAP1 blocks heterochromatic formation at the MIEP but the AD169 observation requires explanation and again suggests that any KAP1 effects could be highly indirect and due to major changes in the cellular biology when knocking out such a key regulator. Again the AD169 data really argues against KAP1 binding being important for controlling latency since KAP1 is recruited to this genome perfectly well but does not provide the same level of control as it apparently does in TB40-E</i>."

We do not have evidence that mTOR is stably associated with KAP1, and we do not expect it to be the case: instead, we think that the kinase is only recruited to HCMV-bound KAP1 molecules, as suggested by the finding that the kinase is still able to repress a genomic target in HCMV-infected cells.

Fine monitoring of the timing of mTOR recruitment in a system where HCMV naturally exits from latency to induce productive infection would be worthwhile, but it is not straightforward, hence beyond the scope of the present study."
