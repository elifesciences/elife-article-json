The RNA molecules in these so-called small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (or snRNPs) are rich in uridine bases, so they are often known as \u2018U snRNPs\u2019. Five of these particles are required for a process called pre-messenger RNA splicing: this involves the removal of introns\u2014regions of RNA that do not code for proteins\u2014from the pre-messenger RNA. Because the vast majority of genes in higher eukaryotes contain introns, this process must take place for almost all messenger RNAs."

When viewed in two dimensions, most of the RNA molecule resembles a cloverleaf (because it folds back on itself to form three loops). The first loop is the binding site for the U1-70k protein, the second is the binding site for the U1-A protein, and the third makes extensive contacts with the Sm ring. The U1 RNA molecule also contains a fourth stem loop, but this is far removed from the business end of the snRNP."

Attempts to obtain a more detailed picture of the structure were unsuccessful, largely because the complex was too flexible to form the highly ordered crystals needed for higher resolution. However, guided by the existing structure, Nagai, Kondo, Oubridge and colleagues were able to cleverly split the snRNP into two smaller substructures, each of which produced more ordered crystals that diffracted to high resolution. One substructure contained the Sm ring, the U1-C protein, a fragment of the U1-70K protein, and a shortened version of the U1 RNA molecule. The fragment of U1-70K was included because it was known to make multiple protein\u2013protein interactions with the Sm ring and the U1-C protein (which also makes many contacts with the Sm ring)."

Of more interest were contacts made between this double-stranded RNA structure (or duplex) and the U1-C protein. It had previously been reported that U1 snRNP lacking its starting sequence, and thus unable to base pair with the 5\u2032 splice site, still selected 5\u2032 splice site sequences from a pool of RNA molecules of random sequence (<a href=\"#bib3\">Du and Rosbash, 2002</a>). This result was interpreted to mean that the U1-C was a sequence specific RNA-binding protein."

Instead, it makes multiple contacts with the sugar phosphate backbones of both RNA strands (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). These observations simultaneously rule out the notion that the U1-C protein is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein and reveal the true role of U1-C in splice site recognition. That is to say that, via backbone interactions, U1-C stabilizes the duplex between the U1 RNA molecule and 5\u2032 splice sties. This stabilization function explains why many 5\u2032 splice site sequences, some of which are not completely complementary to the sequence in the U1 RNA, can still interact in a functionally significant way with the U1 snRNP."

First, it prevents the poly(A) tail\u2014which marks the end of a mature messenger RNA\u2014from being added too early or at the wrong sites in a new pre-messenger RNA (<a href=\"#bib5\">Kaida et al., 2010</a>). This activity likely results from the U1-70K protein antagonizing the enzyme that builds the poly(A) tail onto the messenger RNA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Gunderson et al., 1998</a>). The second function, which may well be related to the first, is that U1 snRNP regulates precisely where a poly(A) tail is added to pre-messenger RNAs with more than one useable site (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berg et al., 2012</a>). As such, this latter function determines how long the mature messenger RNA will be. Third, it is now known that most promoters in higher cells initiate RNA synthesis in both directions. U1 snRNP has a central role in ensuring that only RNA synthesis in the right direction is productive (<a href=\"#bib1\">Almada et al., 2013</a>). As the mechanisms behind these activities are analyzed, the crystal structure of U1 snRNP will undoubtedly aid in the design and interpretation of future biochemical experiments."
