                    "text": "Protein output from synonymous codons is thought to be equivalent if appropriate tRNAs are sufficiently abundant. Here we show that mRNAs encoding iterated lysine codons, AAA or AAG, differentially impact protein synthesis: insertion of iterated AAA codons into an ORF diminishes protein expression more than insertion of synonymous AAG codons. Kinetic studies in <i>E. coli</i> reveal that differential protein production results from pausing on consecutive AAA-lysines followed by ribosome sliding on homopolymeric A sequence. Translation in a cell-free expression system demonstrates that diminished output from AAA-codon-containing reporters results from premature translation termination on out of frame stop codons following ribosome sliding. In eukaryotes, these premature termination events target the mRNAs for Nonsense-Mediated-Decay (NMD). The finding that ribosomes slide on homopolymeric A sequences explains bioinformatic analyses indicating that consecutive AAA codons are under-represented in gene-coding sequences. Ribosome \u2018sliding\u2019 represents an unexpected type of ribosome movement possible during translation."

Here we show that mRNAs encoding iterated lysine codons, AAA or AAG, differentially impact protein synthesis: insertion of iterated AAA codons into an ORF diminishes protein expression more than insertion of synonymous AAG codons. Kinetic studies in <i>E. coli</i> reveal that differential protein production results from pausing on consecutive AAA-lysines followed by ribosome sliding on homopolymeric A sequence. Translation in a cell-free expression system demonstrates that diminished output from AAA-codon-containing reporters results from premature translation termination on out of frame stop codons following ribosome sliding. In eukaryotes, these premature termination events target the mRNAs for Nonsense-Mediated-Decay (NMD). The finding that ribosomes slide on homopolymeric A sequences explains bioinformatic analyses indicating that consecutive AAA codons are under-represented in gene-coding sequences. Ribosome \u2018sliding\u2019 represents an unexpected type of ribosome movement possible during translation."

Both bacterial and eukaryotic cells have evolved mechanisms to deal with such errors which involve (1) proteolytic degradation of the aberrant protein product, (2) mRNA decay and (3) ribosome rescue (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</a>). One such mRNA surveillance pathway in eukaryotes targets mRNAs that lack stop codons (Non-Stop-Decay or NSD). In these cases, actively translating ribosomes are thought to read into the 3\u2032 terminal poly(A) sequence of the mRNA triggering ribosome pausing as poly(lysine) is translated, followed by the recruitment of ubiquitin ligases, mRNA decay and ribosome recycling factors (review <a href=\"#bib31\">Klauer and van Hoof, 2012</a>). Given the substantial amount of premature (or alternative) polyadenylation that has been documented in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ozsolak et al., 2010</a>), it seems that such an mRNA surveillance pathway might have considerable biological significance. Similarly, in bacteria, while no \u2018NSD-like\u2019 response has been characterized, it is known that poly(A) sequences are added to mRNAs in the process of being degraded (review <a href=\"#bib20\">Dreyfus and R\u00e9gnier, 2002</a>), and so ribosomes on these mRNAs may encounter similar challenges. The utilization in bacteria and eukaryotes of 3\u2032 poly(A) tails as non-coding elements may reflect a common solution to the challenges for the ribosome in translating such sequences."

Other factors involved in NSD have since been discovered; these include Dom34 and Hbs1 which facilitate ribosome rescue during NSD (<a href=\"#bib28\">Izawa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tsuboi et al., 2012</a>), Ltn1 and Not4 which ubiquitinate the protein products on non-stop mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dimitrova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>), and a number of other factors genetically identified as critical for poly(basic)-mediated stalling (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kuroha et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chiabudini et al., 2014</a>).

NSD is widely thought to be triggered by unfavorable electrostatic interactions that occur in the ribosomal exit tunnel when ribosomes translate the poly(lysine) sequences encoded by poly(A). Indeed, biochemical studies in rabbit reticulocyte lysate with proteins interrupted by iterated poly(lysine) and poly(arginine) sequences indicate that positively charged residues do slow translation and produce transiently arrested species (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</a>). Other examples of peptide-mediated stalling have also been documented in bacterial and eukaryotic systems. In some cases, such as the <i>tnaC</i> gene, <i>secM</i>, or <i>ermCL</i> in bacteria, the peptide stalling motif is several amino acids in length and appears to specifically engage the contours of the exit tunnel to elicit stalling (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gong and Yanofsky, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Vazquez-Laslop et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Seidelt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bhushan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ito and Chiba, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arenz et al., 2014</a>). Poly(proline) sequences have recently been shown to cause stalling during translation in bacteria and eukaryotes in the absence of specialized bypass factors, EFP and eIF5A, respectively (<a href=\"#bib18\">Doerfel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gutierrez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ude et al., 2013</a>).

We find that insertion of consecutive AAA lysine codons into reporters has a stronger negative impact on protein expression than insertion of an equivalent number of AAG lysine codons in both eukaryotes and bacteria. Kinetic and toeprinting studies in an in vitro reconstituted <i>Escherichia coli</i> translation system reveal that differential protein output is the downstream consequence of ribosome pausing followed by an unanticipated ribosome movement on successive AAA codons that we refer to as \u2018sliding\u2019. When sliding occurs in the middle of genuine ORFs in a cell, frame is lost and ribosomes encounter out of frame stop codons that result in canonical (stop-codon mediated) termination. In eukaryotes, such premature termination events target the mRNA for non-sense mediated decay (NMD). The finding that the ribosome can robustly slide on poly(A) sequences explains bioinformatic analyses revealing that consecutive AAA codons are under-represented in ORFs in all genomes (unpublished data) and helps to rationalize the widespread usage of poly(A) sequence as a regulatory rather than a coding feature."

These reporters were introduced into <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>E. coli</i> cells and the protein products visualized by either luminescence or fluorescence, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The insertion of twelve consecutive negatively charged glutamic acid residues (GAA) had no negative impact on production of the reporter protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). By contrast, the addition of consecutive lysine residues generally resulted in overall less protein production (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), consistent with previous studies of poly(lysine)-containing reporters (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chiabudini et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, we find that protein output from the poly(lysine)-containing reporters is codon dependent in both bacteria and yeast; reporters containing iterated AAG lysine codons generate more protein than those with an equivalent number of synonymous AAA codons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The relative differences in expression of AAG- vs AAA-encoded poly(lysine)-containing reporters in <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are comparable (4 \u00b1 0.3-fold more in <i>E. coli</i> and 3 \u00b1 1-fold more in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> from reporters with AAG<sub>12</sub> vs AAA<sub>12</sub>)."

                                "text": "One potential explanation for the codon-dependent expression of poly(lysine)-containing proteins could be that the ribosome more rapidly incorporates lysine on AAG than AAA codons. In <i>E. coli</i> a single tRNA with a UUU anti-codon decodes both lysine codons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chan and Lowe, 2009</a>), making <i>E. coli</i> an excellent system for studying differences in the production of poly(lysine) peptides. We measured the rate of lysine incorporation using a previously described reconstituted <i>E. coli</i> translation system (<a href=\"#bib51\">Youngman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gromadski et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zaher and Green, 2009</a>) on a series of lysine-encoding simple mRNAs including: AUG-AAA-UUC-AAG-UAA (MKFK-Stop), AUG-UUC-AAA (MFK), AUG-(AAA or AAG)<sub>5</sub>-UAA (MK<sub>(A or G)5</sub>-Stop). Only Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> was included during the translation of MKFK-Stop and MK<sub>5</sub>-Stop mRNAs while both Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> and Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> were present when MFK was translated. Electrophoretic TLC (eTLC) readily resolved the reaction products allowing for analysis of intermediate and complete peptide products (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The quantitated data were modeled in Mathematica using the kinetic scheme displayed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> (see \u2018Material and methods\u2019). These experiments reveal that addition of a single lysine in a heteropolymeric sequence is rapid and independent of whether lysine is the first or second amino acid incorporated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, rate constants for formation of MK and MFK peptides are 12 s<sup>\u22121</sup> and 7 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively); these rates are similar to those typically measured for peptide bond formation in this in vitro system (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gromadski et al., 2006</a>). For messages containing iterated lysine codons, the rate constant for translating the first lysine codon is similarly fast (<i>k</i><sub>1,obs</sub> from 2\u201319 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) for AAA and AAG codons. However, subsequent lysines in an iterated sequence are added with considerably slower kinetics on both AAA (<i>k</i><sub>2,obs</sub> = 0.0005 and <i>k</i><sub>3,obs</sub> = 0.0003 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) and AAG codons (<i>k</i><sub>2,obs</sub> = 0.009 and <i>k</i><sub>3,obs</sub> = 0.015 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We note that the rate of second lysine addition during the translation of MK<sub>5</sub>-STOP messages are somewhat slower on AAA relative to AAG codons, potentially partially explaining the decreased overall protein output on these mRNAs. More importantly, however, these data show that the reactivity of the second Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> on iterated lysine containing messages (such as MK<sub>5</sub>-Stop) is substantially reduced (at least 130-fold) on both lysine codon-containing mRNAs relative to normal elongation rates. Interestingly, the addition of a second lysine to messages with fewer sequential lysine codons (such as MK<sub>2</sub>F-STOP) does not exhibit such a striking kinetic defect (<i>k</i><sub>2,obs</sub> is not largely affected, data not shown). These data suggest that the identity of the message (i.e. a long poly(A) sequence) plays a critical role in the observed slowing of elongation. Toeprinting assays performed using the <i>E. coli</i> PURE cell-free translation system are consistent with these observations; <i>E. coli</i> ribosomes stall when the second lysine codon in iterated (AAA)- and (AAG)-codon containing sequences is positioned in the A site (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these results reveal that translating consecutive lysines in a poly(lysine) peptide sequence, either on iterated AAA or AAG codons, can lead to substantial kinetic delays in vitro."

We speculate that these extended peptides result from the ribosome repeatedly moving backwards by at least three nucleotides to position an AAA Lys codon in the A site, and then subsequent standard peptide bond formation. Toeprinting assays performed on iterated AAA- and AAG-containing mRNAs provide further support for such irregular movement of ribosomes specifically on iterated AAA codons (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); the toeprint on the iterated AAA sequence is diffuse relative to the discrete toeprint seen on iterated AAG sequence. In the course of performing our experiments we carefully considered reports suggesting that T7 RNA polymerase could promiscuously add extra adenosines to poly(A) messages (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tsuchihashi and Brown, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ratinier et al., 2008</a>); no experiment that we performed revealed any evidence for such heterogeneity in our mRNA products (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Unlike better studied \u22121 and +1 frameshifting events, these data suggest that ribosomes on iterated AAA sequences are making unexpected and large excursions from their initial frame; we refer to this process as \u2018ribosome sliding\u2019."

While three or more AAA codons in a row are selected against in gene coding sequences, there are thousands of examples of two consecutive AAA codons in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>E. coli</i> genes (see further details in bioinformatic analysis below, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In the experiments described in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, ribosome initiation complexes formed on the specified MK<sub>A2</sub>-Stop and MK<sub>A2</sub>F-Stop messages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) were only supplied with Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> and essential elongation factors; the subsequent substrates normally present in vivo after the formation of MKK peptide were left out. To determine if ribosome sliding occurs in more typical circumstances, we performed elongation reactions on the same mRNAs, but where both Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> and the relevant other downstream substrates (release factor 1 (RF1) or Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>) were added to the ribosome initiation complexes. The result is clear; in this latter case, the anticipated MKKF or MKK peptide products are predominantly generated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data suggest that ribosome sliding on iterated AAA sequences occurs more slowly than the normal rate of peptidyl transfer with Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> or RF1-catalyzed peptide release, respectively. Moreover, these results readily explain how the ribosome can normally translate (at least two) sequential AAA codons in vivo without sliding. When there are more than two AAA codons in a row, each lysine after the first is added slowly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), raising the possibility that sliding may become relevant on such messages."

As a positive control, we observed that peptidyl-tRNA product generated from a non-stop mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, lanes 9\u201310) does indeed change in mobility when treated with RNase A (see uppermost band resolve into smaller peptide products from this inefficiently translated mRNA). By contrast, the truncated band generated from the (AAA)<sub>12</sub>-containing reporter does not shift in mobility on a gel following RNase A treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, lanes 5\u20136). We closely examined our reporter sequence and found that there are several out of frame stop-codons following the (AAA)<sub>12</sub> insert (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We next showed that the truncated band is generated by RF-mediated peptide release, likely on a canonical stop codon reached following ribosome sliding on poly(A) sequence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, lanes 7\u20138). Further experiments indicate that both RF1 and RF2 can promote release of this product and that the release reaction is independent of RF3 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The formation of truncated product from our (AAA)<sub>12</sub> reporters is a signature that reports on ribosome sliding on iterated AAA sequences. We note that the truncated band is also observed when the mCherry reporter is expressed in <i>E. coli</i> (and a western is performed with an \u03b1-HA antibody) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Truncated product (which we have determined to be a signature of ribosome sliding) was generated with as few as three consecutive lysines.

Upf1 is a key protein in NMD and <i>upf1</i>\u0394 cells stabilize PTC-containing transcripts. Previous studies established that when ribosomes frameshift during translation, these mRNAs are typically targeted for decay by NMD because the ribosomes generally encounter an out of frame premature termination codon (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belew et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2014</a>). We proposed that if the ribosome slides on iterated AAA-containing mRNAs in yeast, as it does in the bacterial system, then iterated AAA-containing mRNAs should be targeted by NMD. We addressed this possibility by measuring the levels of (AAA)<sub>12</sub>, (AAG)<sub>12</sub>, and (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>-containing mRNAs in two different yeast-expressed reporter systems (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) in wild-type and <i>upf1</i>\u0394 cells."

We find that the levels of mRNA for PTC and stem-loop containing reporters are lowered (PTC = 2 fold, stem-loop = 21 fold) relative to reporters with no insert in wild-type yeast cells. Moreover, as expected, the level of PTC, but not stem-loop-containing, mRNA is recovered when the reporters are expressed in <i>upf1</i>\u0394 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). When this same experiment was performed with a luciferase reporter containing an (AAA)<sub>12</sub> sequence, we find that reporter mRNA levels are substantially reduced in wild-type cells (&gt;50-fold down), and that these levels are partially recovered in a <i>upf1</i>\u0394 strain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

In addition to measuring the absolute levels of reporter mRNAs in wild-type and <i>upf1</i>\u0394 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we asked whether the rates of mRNA decay for these reporters are impacted in the <i>upf1</i>\u0394 knock-out background (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We chose to include a mixed AAA/AAG reporter in addition to the simpler AAA and AAG repeat reporters because this sequence is commonly used to report on the NSD phenomenon (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dimitrova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chiabudini et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2014</a>). Indeed, a recent study with an (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>-containing reporter argued that a truncated product generated by such a construct resulted from an unusual release factor-dependent termination event on a sense (lysine) codon (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chiabudini et al., 2014</a>). In an attempt to recapitulate these results, we directly looked for evidence of eRF1:eRF3-mediated termination activity on iterated lysine mRNAs in vitro using a yeast reconstituted translation system (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shoemaker et al., 2010</a>); we see no evidence that such an event can occur (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We propose that an alternative explanation for the published data could be that the ribosome slides out of frame on the (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub> sequence, resulting in premature termination on a previously out-of-frame stop codon, akin to what we observe in the PURE <i>E. coli</i> cell-free translation system (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

In contrast, the levels of (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub> and (AAA)<sub>12</sub> reporter mRNAs are significantly reduced compared to the control (no insert) reporter (15-fold and 30-fold, respectively). These observations are consistent with the low levels of protein expressed in vivo from these reporters relative to sequences containing no insert or (AAG)<sub>12</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As with the luciferase reporters, the level of mCherry mRNA containing an (AAA)<sub>12</sub> insert is partially recovered by the deletion of <i>UPF1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Strikingly, when the (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>-containing reporters are expressed in <i>upf1</i>\u0394 cells, the mRNA levels are nearly fully recovered. The mRNA half-lives for these reporters are similarly recovered in the <i>upf1</i>\u0394 cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus both the (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub> and (AAA)<sub>12</sub> reporter mRNAs are targeted by NMD in yeast cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

This is highlighted by the observation that the longer the stretch of lysines, the lower the likelihood of the motif being comprised solely of AAA codons (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Such an underrepresentation of AAA codons becomes pronounced in runs of 3 or 4 lysine codons in both organisms. In <i>E. coli</i>, only a single AAA-AAA-AAA sequence is present, which is 50-fold less common than expected based on the frequency of AAA codons; in contrast, (AAG)<sub>3</sub> sequences are found 3.3-fold more often than expected.

Here, we provide mechanistic insight into what initially happens when the ribosome encounters poly(A) sequence. First, we find that the expression of proteins containing poly(lysine) stretches is codon-dependent in both bacteria and eukaryotes, with reporters containing iterated AAA codons consistently producing less protein than those with equivalent AAG codons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 4</a>). This differential protein output is not the result of imprecise RNA polymerase action (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) nor likely of disparities in the rate of adding lysine codons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>); lysines are slowly incorporated on iterated AAA and AAG codons. Instead, the codon-dependent disparity primarily stems from an unusual sliding event that occurs when ribosomes encounter consecutive AAA codons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 4</a>). Our observation that ribosomes can slide in multiple frames on iterated AAA sequences provides a rationale for consecutive AAA codons being substantially under-represented in open reading frames in most genomes (see Bioinformatic discussion below, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and (unpublished data)."

On these messages, the first lysine is added quickly (<i>k</i><sub>1,obs</sub>) while subsequent lysines are added more slowly, causing the ribosome to pause. We note that the rate constants measured in the in vitro assay reflect all of the processes that can occur each time a new lysine moiety is added to the growing polypeptide chain (Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> binding, peptidyl-transfer, translocation, peptidyl-tRNA drop-off, 70S complex instability, etc). We suspect it to be unlikely that ribosome pausing is caused solely by dramatically large defects in peptidyl-transfer, but instead may result from ribosomes that become effectively inactivated (e.g. as a result of complex instability on homopolymeric A messages, etc). Whatever the cause for an initial ribosome pausing event on iterated AAA sequences, the ribosome can either slide or perform another round of peptide bond formation. If the ribosome slides such that another AAA codon is positioned in the A site, the next step will also be slow, while if sliding somehow positions a non-lysine codon in the A site, recovery from slow elongation may occur. In our in vitro system translating di-lysine messages, we are able to observe sliding when consecutive AAA-codons are present because we force a strong pause after MKK formation by leaving out downstream factors required for translation to proceed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Our data suggest that ribosome sliding on iterated AAA sequences is the major difference between the translation of poly(AAA)- and poly(AAG)-containing messages that results in substantially different protein outputs. While each sequential addition of lysine in an iterated AAG sequence may be slow, the ribosome maintains frame and ultimately is able to produce full-length protein. By contrast, with repeated AAA sequences, the ribosome can eventually escape the homopolymeric A sequence through repeated sliding events, often emerging out-of-frame from the A stretch, and thus unable to produce full-length protein."

During a programmed frame-shifting (PRF) event, specific signals direct elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by one base in the 5\u2032 (\u22121) or 3\u2032 (+1) direction (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dinman, 2012</a>). \u22121 PRFs signals are typically characterized by a \u2018slippery\u2019 sequence (X XXY YYZ) that is modulated by the presence of a downstream secondary structure, most commonly a pseudoknot (<a href=\"#bib36\">Plant et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jacobs et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Caliskan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). The secondary structure impairs the normal movement of the ribosome during translocation, and promotes the frame-shift event in an EF-G dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caliskan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). +1 PRFs signals are more diverse than \u22121 PRFs, but still generally depend on a slippery sequence and a downstream element (e.g., secondary structure or rare codon) that causes the ribosome to pause (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dinman, 2012</a>). Iterated A stretches are inherently slippery and contain a built-in translation pause (adding consecutive lysines is slow\u2014<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), however the poly(A) sequences that we have studied lack significant secondary structure downstream that might contribute to limiting unregulated ribosome sliding. As such, when ribosomes slide on iterated AAA codons, forward and backward movements may be permitted. The scale of the movements undergone during a ribosome sliding event may be more similar to those documented in translational bypassing on the gene product 60 of bacteriophage T4 which is synthesized from a discontinuous reading frame (<a href=\"#bib38\">Samatova et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, however, in contrast to this specific concerted large-scale movement (50 nucleotides) which results in the production of a single peptide product, ribosome sliding is different in that no single outcome appears to be encoded by the event. The inability of the ribosome to translate a discrete product on homopolymeric A sequences likely explains the bioinformatic analyses demonstrating that poly(A) sequences are strongly selected against in coding sequences containing iterated lysines (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Consistent with this idea, in <i>E. coli</i> we find that the minimum length (11) of a homopolymeric A sequence needed to trigger ribosome sliding in the PURE cell-free translation system (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) correlates with the length of lysine stretch at which homopolymeric sequences are selected against in mRNA coding regions (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

We find that mRNA levels for reporters containing (AAA)<sub>12</sub> or (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>, but not (AAG)<sub>12</sub> sequences, are reduced in a Upf1-dependent manner. These data are consistent with the idea that sliding on homopolymeric A stretches can eventually lead to ribosomes reaching out-of-frame premature termination codons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). A recent report in the literature argued that translation of poly(lysine) stretches led to an unusual termination event on a sense codon (AAA or AAG) mediated by eRF3 (presumably in concert with its binding partner eRF1) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chiabudini et al., 2014</a>). These observations bring to mind premature termination events on sense codons documented in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zaher and Green, 2009</a>); this quality control system was proposed to increase the fidelity of translation by minimizing frame-shifting and eliminating errors made during tRNA selection. We note that the premature termination event that we previously documented in <i>E. coli</i> was highly dependent on RF3, while the termination event documented in <i>E. coli</i> in this manuscript at homopolymeric A sequences is RF3-independent (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given the clear evidence that we provide for ribosome sliding in the <i>E. coli</i> system and the inability to observe eRF1:eRF3-mediated peptide release on homopolymeric A programmed yeast ribosome complexes in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we suggest that the most likely explanation for the eRF3-dependent truncated product generated in yeast cells on (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>\u2013encoding reporters in Chiabudini et al. is the result of ribosome sliding and canonical recognition of downstream premature stop codons. We note that there are multiple out-of-frame stop codons following the (AAGAAGAAA)<sub>4</sub>-repeat that could account for the observed products in Chiabudini et al. (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chiabudini et al., 2014</a>)."

We speculate that the more modest sliding within the (AAGAAGAAA)-repeats might be distinguished from the sliding on (AAA)-repeats in an important way. Sliding within homopolymeric AAA sequence most typically results in another nearby AAA codon being poised in the A site, and another inefficient elongation event with Lys-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>. Ribosomes that eventually exit the poly(A) sequence to reach heteropolymeric sequence and an out-of-frame downstream premature stop codon will trigger NMD; ribosomes that struggle to get past the very long stretch of iterated lysine codons will instead trigger NSD. As such, the mRNA levels for the (AAA)<sub>12</sub> reporter are partially recovered by a <i>UPF1</i> deletion and partially recovered by a <i>DOM34</i> deletion (data not shown). By contrast, on the (AAGAAGAAA)-repeat reporters, sliding has the potential to quickly place the ribosomes in a more productive frame for efficient elongation (one frame will result in Arg-Arg-Lys (RRK) repeats while the other frame will result in Glu-Glu-Lys (EEK) repeats). While we might predict that the poly(basic) RRKRRKRRKRR peptide will also be slowly translated, a ribosome that slides into the frame encoding the EEKEEKEEKEE peptide should be able to resume efficient elongation. As such, fewer ribosomes may trigger NSD and, instead, a majority of ribosomes will reach downstream premature stop codons that trigger NMD. These ideas can easily be understood in the context of the model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> where differences in the elongation rates (e.g. slow for iterated lysine residues but fast for incorporation of other amino acids) will impact the relative contribution of ribosome sliding to overall outcome."

These studies led to the idea that NSD is triggered when the ribosome stalls while translating a poly(basic) lysine sequence. NSD is commonly studied using reporters in yeast that contain poly(basic) inserts; common lysine and arginine inserts that have been investigated include (AAA)<sub>12</sub>, (AAG)<sub>12</sub>, (AAG-AAG-AAA)<sub>4</sub>, and (CGG-(CGA)<sub>2</sub>-CGG-(CGC)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dimitrova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chiabudini et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2014</a>).

Despite these differences, because the mRNA and protein levels for all of these are broadly sensitive to known NSD factors (Ltn1, Dom34, Ski7), poly(basic) sequences have been treated equally. Our results demonstrating that ribosomes can slide on consecutive AAA codons suggest that there may be important distinctions to be made in considering these reporters and that there may be substantial mechanistic overlaps in these systems."

                        "text": "Even though cells rarely maintain homopolymeric A sequences in ORFs, there are some situations where the ribosome likely must deal with homopolymeric A stretches in both bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, mRNAs are typically polyadenylated as part of the normal decay process (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dreyfus and R\u00e9gnier, 2002</a>). For example, ribosome sliding might provide an escape for ribosomes already engaged on these mRNAs (a form of ribosome rescue). In eukaryotes, virtually all mRNAs in the cell are polyadenylated, but usually a stop codon is found at the end of the encoded ORF. However, there is abundant recent evidence indicating that a significant portion of yeast (14%) and human (9%) genes contain at least one alternative polyadenylation site within their coding sequence (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ozsolak et al., 2010</a>). It has even been suggested that premature polyadenylation may become up-regulated in cancerous cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berg et al., 2012</a>). In cases where premature polyadenylation takes place within the ORF, the ribosome will surely encounter a homopolymeric A sequence, likely triggering so called Non-Stop-Decay (NSD). In light of the results presented here, we would suggest that the triggering of NSD (and associated mRNA decay, proteolysis and ribosome recycling) occurs following the slow translation of iterated lysines and ribosome sliding events. The ubiquity of premature polyadenylation suggests that NSD broadly serves as an important pathway for regulating gene expression. The observation of synonymous AAG to AAA changes in iterated lysine stretches in genes upregulated in cancer provides support for the significance of this mechanism of gene regulation (unpublished data). The widespread use of polyadenylation for non-coding purposes in mRNA transcripts may find its origins in the inability of the decoding machine, the ribosome, to carefully control the behavior of these sequences."

The only direct reporter that is employed by is the toe-print assay that is in the supplementary. This assay should be in the main text. It could be presented in a more appropriate manner showing the nucleotide sequence (together with the amino acid sequence) so that the reader can understand why the data supports ribosome slippage, and exactly which frame the ribosomes are in with the different constructs. You should perhaps indicate this using an accompanying schematic. You might also consider using an mRNA with a unique codon downstream of the polylysine sequence in different frames so that you can monitor read-through and change of frame by omitting the unique amino acid from the translation reaction to stall ribosomes on this codon if they make it through the polylysine stretch."

It could be presented in a more appropriate manner showing the nucleotide sequence (together with the amino acid sequence) so that the reader can understand why the data supports ribosome slippage, and exactly which frame the ribosomes are in with the different constructs. You should perhaps indicate this using an accompanying schematic. You might also consider using an mRNA with a unique codon downstream of the polylysine sequence in different frames so that you can monitor read-through and change of frame by omitting the unique amino acid from the translation reaction to stall ribosomes on this codon if they make it through the polylysine stretch</i>."

For example, the toe-prints indicate that ribosomes pause while adding sequential lysines, but our kinetic data more directly address this (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Furthermore, while the toe-prints suggest that the ribosomes get out of frame on poly(A) messages, our PURE reactions in the presence and absence of release factors demonstrate quite clearly that ribosomes can get out of frame on homopolymeric A messages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C and 5</a>)."
