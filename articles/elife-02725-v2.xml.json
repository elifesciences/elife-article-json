Using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, we here confirm an MMR-deficient mutation signature that is distinct from other tumor genomes, but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, indicating that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations escaping MMR. Moreover, we identify a large set of recurrent indels that may serve to detect microsatellite instability (MSI). Indeed, using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, we optimize a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI and show it to have greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Additionally, we show that recurrent indels are enriched for the \u2018DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination\u2019 pathway. Consequently, DSB repair is reduced in MMR-deficient tumors, triggering a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor cultures to DSB inducers."

Using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, we here confirm an MMR-deficient mutation signature that is distinct from other tumor genomes, but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, indicating that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations escaping MMR. Moreover, we identify a large set of recurrent indels that may serve to detect microsatellite instability (MSI). Indeed, using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, we optimize a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI and show it to have greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Additionally, we show that recurrent indels are enriched for the \u2018DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination\u2019 pathway. Consequently, DSB repair is reduced in MMR-deficient tumors, triggering a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor cultures to DSB inducers."

This revealed that MMR-deficient tumors have similar patterns of mutations to those seen in egg and sperm cells. This was unexpected and suggests that mutations that are not corrected by mismatch repair are an important source of the genetic differences found between different humans, and between humans and their ancestors."

However, current clinical methods to identify MMR-deficient tumors often fail or produce results that are difficult to interpret. MMR-deficient tumors commonly contain mutations called indels, where short fragments of DNA are inserted or deleted into longer DNA sequences. Zhao et al. have found 59 indels that can be used to detect MMR-deficient tumors, where each indel had been identified in several tumors taken from different tissues. This new approach allowed MMR-deficiency to be identified in several types of tumor, including colon and ovarian cancers, with greater sensitivity and accuracy than the existing methods."

As this kind of damage is very harmful to a cell, making more double-strand breaks could therefore form part of a more effective treatment against MMR-deficient tumors; further research is needed to investigate this possibility."

Lynch syndrome is responsible for 2\u20135% of endometrial (EM) or colorectal (CRC) tumors. Additionally, epigenetic silencing of <i>MLH1</i> contributes to another 15\u201328% of these tumors (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parsons et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Peltomaki, 2014</a>). Deficiency of the MMR machinery leads to DNA replication errors in the tumor tissue, but not the normal surrounding tissue. In particular, errors often accumulate as indel mutations in mono- and di-nucleotide repeats\u2014a phenomenon referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pinol et al., 2005</a>)."

Untreated CRC patients with MMR-deficient tumors have a modestly better prognosis, but do not seem to benefit from 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, which is the first-choice chemotherapy for CRC. In particular, in MMR-deficient tumors, mismatches induced by 5-fluorouracil are tolerated, leading to failure to induce cell death (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fischer et al., 2007</a>). MMR-deficient tumors are also resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin, which are frequently used chemotherapies in EM cancer (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hewish et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, MMR-deficient tumors can be resistant to targeted therapies, because they acquire secondary mutations in genes that activate alternative or downstream signaling pathways (e.g., <i>PIK3CA</i>). Another possibility is that epigenetic silencing of <i>MLH1</i> coincides with particular mutations, such as the <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Donehower et al., 2013</a>), which represents an established negative predictor of response to targeted anti-EGFR therapies in advanced CRC (<a href=\"#bib52\">Richman et al., 2009</a>)."

Until now, these findings failed, however, to translate into clinically effective treatment options. Alternatively, as highlighted above, secondary mutations occurring because of MMR-deficiency may also critically determine therapeutic efficacy (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dorard et al., 2011</a>). These secondary mutation spectra have, however, been poorly characterized, mainly because studies often focused at one or a few reporter loci, or exclusively on mutations at known hotspot sequences. More recently, the first whole-exome sequencing of MMR-deficient tumors was performed, highlighting the clearly distinct mutational landscape of these tumors (<a href=\"#bib60\">TCGA, 2012</a>), whereas at the whole-genome level, <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al.

Three chemo-naive EM tumors, either deficient for MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 and thus covering the full spectrum of MMR-deficiency, as well as two MMR-proficient EM tumors were selected (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Different sequencing technologies were leveraged to avoid potential technology biases in assessing mutation patterns in MMR-deficient tumor genomes, that is, Complete Genomics (CG) and Illumina short-read sequencing. We obtained high coverage sequencing data (30\u2013120x) for tumor and matched normal samples (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Application of a standard annotation and filtering pipeline, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib51\">Reumers et al., 2011</a>), revealed that each MMR-deficient tumor exhibited a clear hypermutator phenotype, containing on average 50 times more novel somatic mutations than MMR-proficient tumors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>). Orthogonal technologies validated 98% of substitutions and 88% of indels in the three MMR-deficient tumors, while only 62% of substitutions and 11% of indels were validated in the two MMR-proficient tumors (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 3</a>). This difference in validation rates between MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient tumors is probably due to the fact that in normal genomes, as well as MMR-proficient tumor genomes, the number of true-positive indels is low in comparison to the number of false-positive indels. However, in MMR-deficient tumors, due to their specific hypermutator phenotype, the number of true-positive indels is vastly increased, thereby rendering the false positive fraction proportionally much smaller. Notably, all tumors were negative for <i>POLE</i> mutations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kandoth et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Palles et al., 2013</a>)."

In homopolymer regions, there was a 16% decrease in indel frequency in exonic regions. In non-homopolymer regions, a clear decrease was also observed for exonic regions, confirming that the decrease in exonic indels is not only due to differences in homopolymer characteristics between exonic regions and the rest of the genome. This reveals apparent negative selection in exonic regions, independent of homopolmer content, composition or length of the homopolymers."

                                "text": "Studies in model organisms and cell lines have shown that somatic mutations arising due to MMR-deficiency mostly involve indels affecting microsatellite sequences (di- to hexa-nucleotide repeats with a minimal length of six bases and at least two repeat units) and homopolymers (mononucleotide repeats with a minimal length of six bases) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ellegren, 2004</a>). We observed that indels were indeed more frequent than single basepair substitutions in all three MMR-deficient tumors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Indels predominantly affected homopolymers (40-fold enrichment over expected by chance) and to a lesser extent also microsatellites (2.3-fold enrichment; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Substitutions were only slightly enriched in homopolymers and microsatellites (3- and 1.5-fold enrichment, respectively; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Mutations occurred as frequently in introns as in the rest of the genome, but were clearly less frequent in exons (excluding 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions [UTRs]). This decrease was caused by indels that were 91% less frequent in exons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Correction for the number of homopolymers, the length of homopolymers or their basepair composition in exons versus other regions weakened this effect, but failed to completely alleviate it (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Since 92% of exonic indels resulted in frameshift mutations, which have a greater functional impact than substitutions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Montgomery et al., 2013</a>), this suggests that exonic indels are prone to negative clonal selection during tumorigenesis."

When assessing somatic substitutions in MMR-deficient tumors, we observed that 74% of all substitutions represent transitions (i.e., purine-to-purine or pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine substitutions), which is similar to the patterns observed in the matched germ-line of these tumors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This is surprising, since tumor genomes generally display patterns distinct from those found in the germ-line. Indeed, when extending these analyses to other hypermutators, that is, UV-light-induced melanoma (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pleasance et al., 2010</a>), tobacco smoke-induced small cell lung adenocarcinoma (SCLC) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pleasance et al., 2010</a>), as well as breast tumors deficient for BRCA1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</a>) or EM tumors proficient for MMR, patterns were clearly dissimilar from the matched germ-line (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). On the other hand, de novo germ-line substitutions identified through whole-genome sequencing of parent\u2013offspring trios (<a href=\"#bib5\">Campbell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kong et al., 2012</a>), common genetic variation as catalogued by the 1000 Genomes Project (1 KG) (<a href=\"#bib1\">1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012</a>), and substitutions that occurred in the human lineage during the divergence of humans and chimpanzees correlated strongly to the MMR-deficient tumor genome (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Given these remarkable parallels, we hypothesized that MMR-deficient genomes hypermutate in a way that mirrors the processes driving genetic variation on a population level, albeit somatically and on a shorter time scale."

At the small-scale level, when assessing the effect of flanking nucleotides on substitution frequencies, the patterns of all four sets of germ-line genetic variants were highly correlated to MMR-deficient tumors (average <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.77), but less to the four other cancer genomes (average <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.45; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), providing further support for our hypothesis. On a large-scale context, the number of intergenic substitutions per 1 Mb in germ-line genetic variability databases was similarly highly correlated to those in MMR-deficient genomes (average <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.67), but not to those in other cancer genomes (average <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.42; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This suggests that also on a large scale, substitutions are comparably distributed in MMR-deficient tumor genomes as in germ-line genomes. At the large-scale level, nine genomic features are linked with genetic variability (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hodgkinson and Eyre-Walker, 2011</a>). Each of these features correlated significantly with substitution frequencies in MMR-deficient tumors and germ-line genomes. Linear modeling revealed that six of these independently correlated with substitution rates in MMR-deficient tumors as well as with germ-line substitutions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Overall, the types as well as the narrow and broad context-dependencies of substitutions thus appear to be largely shared between germ-line and MMR-deficient genomes, suggesting that a considerable fraction of human genetic diversity arises through mismatches escaping MMR."

                                "text": "Since MMR-proficient tumors carried 50 times fewer substitutions and displayed more disparate substitution patterns than MMR-proficient tumors, the observed correlations can almost exclusively be attributed to the MMR-deficient phenotype of these tumors. As such, these correlations also provide novel insights into the functioning of the MMR system. First, replication timing correlated with transitions but not transversions in all three MMR-deficient tumors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This contrasts with the increase in late S phase transversions observed in all other genomes studied here (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), as well as in lymphoblastoid cell lines (<a href=\"#bib29\">Koren et al., 2012</a>). The increase in MMR-proficient but not MMR-deficient cells suggests a reduced fidelity of DNA repair in late S phase, leading to an increase in transversions. Potential causes include a decreased MMR-activity in late S phase, or a longer window of time available for the repair of early vs late transversions in MMR-proficient cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hombauer et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, DNA repair fidelity in MMR-deficient cells is invariably low and therefore not affected by replication time. Secondly, a positive association with simple repeat content was noted. Indeed, a 1.6-fold increase in substitutions at bases immediately flanking simple repeats was noted, with a threefold increase next to homopolymers and a 1.3-fold increase next to microsatellites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). These substitutions for the vast majority converted the base flanking the repeat, to the base constituting the repeat (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). They are thus probably the result of polymerase slippage events, following a mechanism akin to the previously described bacterial dislocation mutagenesis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kunkel and Soni, 1988</a>). Thirdly, G:C&gt;A:T transitions in CpG sites strongly depend on CpG content, but are inversely correlated with the fraction of CpG islands (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Spontaneous, replication-independent deaminations of methyl-C to T underlie such transitions. Here, the much larger increase in CG&gt;TG transitions observed in MMR-deficient compared to MMR-proficient tumors (3449 vs 145) demonstrates that replication-independent MMR, recently described at the molecular level (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shell et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pena-Diaz et al., 2012</a>), is also involved in deamination repair in vivo (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Finally, overall substitution frequencies correlated inversely with CpG islands. Indeed, irrespective of dinucleotide context, bases outside CpG islands were nearly two times more likely to undergo mutation than those inside CpG islands (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). As CpG islands are generally unmethylated, DNA methylation thus appears to contribute to the mutagenic process. Explanations for this observation include the polymerase stalling that DNA methylation may induce (<a href=\"#bib56\">Song et al., 2012</a>), and the repair of spontaneously deaminated methyl-Cs, which is error-prone and thus mutagenic on its own (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014</a>)."

Furthermore, 34 and 10 homopolymers were affected in \u22656 or \u22658 tumors (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 3</a>). In contrast, only 55 substitutions were recurrent, three of which were found in \u22652 tumors (i.e., two substitutions affecting <i>KRAS</i> codon 12 and 13 were found in three and four tumors [<a href=\"#bib61\">Tie et al., 2011</a>], whereas a substitution in <i>ZNF648</i> affected three tumors). When comparing homopolymer content of coding regions vs UTRs, long homopolymers (&gt;10 bps) were more frequent in UTRs than in coding regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Because these long homopolymers were also more frequently affected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), the overall indel rate in coding regions was lower than in UTRs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). As a consequence of this difference, recurrent indels also occurred more frequently in UTRs than coding regions (31,438 vs 1337; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 3</a>). Remarkably, however, recurrent indels were more frequently observed than expected based on indel frequency in short, but not in long homopolymers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This suggests that features other than homopolymer length underlie indel recurrence rates. Positive clonal selection of indels affecting short homopolymers, which are predominant in coding regions, represents a possible explanation. Very similar results were obtained when the analysis was repeated only on the 13 whole-exomes, indicating that exonic mutations identified from whole-genome sequences did not introduce any bias."

                                "text": "The extended Bethesda panel, which consists of eight microsatellite and two homopolymer markers, is currently used to diagnostically assess MSI (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pinol et al., 2005</a>). This panel was historically compiled from a limited set of markers known to be variable. Due to their length and variability, these markers are notoriously difficult to analyze and interpret. As a consequence, the Bethesda panel has reduced sensitivity to detect MSI. In an effort to improve MSI testing, we randomly selected 59 recurrent indels affecting \u22656 out of 16 tumors; 50 markers were in 5\u2032 or 3\u2032UTRs and 9 were in coding regions (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Furthermore, each of the markers was detected in both MMR-deficient EM and CRC. To facilitate high-throughput genotyping, the maximal length of affected homopolymers was restricted to 12 bps. First, we applied these 59 markers to a discovery set of 236 EM tumors for which MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) data were available. This allowed us to determine three positive markers as the threshold with the best Matthew correlation coefficient to detect MMR-deficiency based on IHC and thus to define MSI (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). At this threshold, our markers detected 40 out of 41 tumors MMR-deficient on IHC (sensitivity \u223c98%), while only 1 out of 184 MMR-normal tumors on IHC were identified as MSI (specificity &gt; 99%). Notably, the latter patient had a familial history of cancer within the Lynch spectrum, suggesting that the tumor indeed exhibited MSI. Secondly, after having optimized the marker threshold, a head-to-head comparison against Bethesda panel was performed in 114 independent EM tumors as a validation. When observing discordances, we assessed MMR-deficiency using IHC to address which of both MSI panels was correct. Briefly, each MSI tumor on Bethesda (&gt;2 markers positive) was also MSI with the 59-marker panel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, 12 tumors were positive in the 59-marker panel, but negative in Bethesda. IHC on the nine discordant tumors for which a paraffin block was available confirmed that each of them was MMR-deficient either for MLH1 or MSH2, indicating that the 59-marker panel has a higher sensitivity compared to Bethesda."

For endometrial tumors, 71 tumors (62%) were defined as MSS/MSI-L and 43 tumors (38%) as MSI-H by the 59-marker panel. Out of these 43 MSI-H tumors, Bethesda identified 32 tumors as MSI-H (&gt;2 markers positive), 7 tumors as MSI-L, and 5 tumors as MSS. Vice versa, Bethesda did not identify any MSI-H tumor that was not identified by our panel. For colorectal tumors, there were 97 MSS tumors in our 59-marker panel that were concordantly called MSS or MSI-L by the Bethesda panel.

We focused on frameshift indels in exons and exon/intron boundaries as they represent loss-of-function mutations (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ham et al., 2006</a>), and thus have a less ambiguous functional impact than indels in UTRs. On average, each MMR-deficient tumor contained 472 such indels, 59 of which were recurrent indels. Pathway analyses using IPA of all genes affected by a somatic indel, excluding the core MMR genes, ranked the \u2018<i>Role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response\u2019</i> as the top enriched pathway. IPA analysis of genes affected by recurrent indels moreover revealed that the \u2018<i>Double-strand break repair by homologous recombination</i>\u2019 pathway (<i>DSBR by HR</i>) ranked top (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We also performed pathway analyses using the more advanced GenomeMuSiC, which takes background mutation rates into account and assigns weights depending on the number of tumors and genes affected in a given pathway. GenomeMuSiC analyses based on either the independently assembled Reactome or BioCarta pathway databases, ranked respectively the \u2018<i>ATR/BRCA pathway</i> and the <i>DNA repair\u2019</i> pathway first, with the more specific \u2018<i>Homologous recombination repair\u2019</i> pathway ranking third in the latter (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Based on an expert curated DNA repair database (DNARepairDB), \u2018<i>Homologous recombination\u2019</i> represented the only DNA repair pathway that was significantly enriched in indels. Since each pathway database differed with respect to the genes included, we finally compiled a literature-based set of genes with proven involvement in <i>DSBR by HR</i>, allowing us to more accurately estimate that each MMR-deficient tumor on average contained 3.3 \u00b1 0.4 indels in the \u2018<i>DSBR by HR\u2019</i> pathway (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Table 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Notably, none of the top-ranking pathways for any of the databases contained significantly more homopolymers in their genes than expected."

Having established that MMR-deficient tumors are enriched in heterozygous frameshift mutations in the <i>DSBR by HR</i> pathway, we investigated the functional impact of these events. First, we confirmed that indels affecting the <i>DSBR by HR</i> pathway were located in the major tumor subclone (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Table 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Then, we analyzed HR in seven MMR-deficient and four MMR-proficient patient-derived primary tumor cultures. We exposed these cultures to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, which induces DSBs upon DNA replication through single-strand break repair inhibition, and to mitomycin C, which induces DSBs through DNA cross-links and replication fork collapse (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bunting et al., 2012</a>). We then quantified the relative number of cells with \u03b3H2AX- and RAD51-positive foci, respectively, as a measure of induced DSBs and ongoing HR. Exposure to olaparib or mitomycin C triggered an increase in \u03b3H2AX-foci in all tumor cultures, regardless of MMR status. In contrast, although RAD51 foci formation was evident in MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient cultures, the increase was far less pronounced in MMR-deficient cultures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), and this for both olaparib (p = 0.021) and mitomycin C (p = 0.006) exposure. The reduction in RAD51 foci could not be ascribed to differences in RAD51 protein expression or differences in cell cycle between MMR-deficient and -proficient cells, as these were similar between both sets of cultures, under both treated and untreated conditions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>). Since RAD51 foci are completely absent upon PARP inhibition in cells with homozygous loss of <i>BRCA1</i>, but not affected in heterozygous mutation carriers (<a href=\"#bib15\">Farmer et al., 2005</a>), these ex vivo data suggest that the accumulation of indels in MMR-deficient tumors gradually impairs the <i>DSBR by HR</i> pathway to a level that is intermediate to that of cells heterozygous- and homozygous-deficient for BRCA1."

First, since PARP inhibitors are already used in clinical practice, all seven MMR-deficient and four MMR-proficient cultures were dose-dependently exposed to olaparib. This revealed that MMR-deficient cultures exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation upon exposure to olaparib, whereas MMR-proficient cultures were only affected at higher concentrations. Likewise, cell cytotoxicity assays revealed a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient cells to olaparib that was more pronounced than in MMR-proficient cells (50% growth inhibition [GI50]) was reached at 26 \u00b5M vs 129 \u00b5M, respectively, p = 0.0064 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATR expression was dose-dependently reduced using siRNAs in the MMR- and HR-proficient cell line, MCF7.

With respect to somatic substitutions, we observed that the majority represented transitions and not transversions, and that adjacent nucleotides and various genomic features had an important context-dependent effect on determining which nucleotides were affected. Remarkably, the observed substitution pattern, in particular how it was impacted by small and large-scale contexts, was very similar to that in the germ-line at different time scales: for germ-line substitutions as they currently arise (de novo), as they have accumulated in the human population or as they served as a substrate for human-chimpanzee divergence (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hodgkinson and Eyre-Walker, 2011</a>). Our observations thus suggest that, similar to bacterial populations and other lower organisms (<a href=\"#bib53\">Saint-Ruf and Matic, 2006</a>), incomplete mismatch repair in humans contributes significantly to genetic variability and probably also to natural selection through genetic adaptation. Additionally, our data provide fundamental insights into the function of the MMR machinery. We observed, for instance, a higher number of substitutions in methylated CpG sequences, implicating MMR in the repair of methylated cytosine deamination and demonstrating that MMR disconnected from the replication fork is also critical to maintain genomic integrity."

Although indel detection using high-throughput sequencing is burdened with high false-positive rates, 88.0% of the indels identified here validated favorably using orthogonal technologies. When focusing on the clinical relevance of indel mutation patterns to diagnose MSI, we observed that indels specifically affected homopolymer stretches, which is relevant as the extended Bethesda panel consists of eight microsatellite and only two homopolymer markers and possibly therefore has only limited sensitivity relative to IHC (\u223c75% for both EM and CRC tumors [<a href=\"#bib18\">Hampel et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2008</a>]). Our 59-marker panel consisting only of markers in homopolymers was clearly more sensitive than Bethesda, yielding sensitivity rates of 87% relative to IHC. This was not due to the fact that we genotyped more markers than Bethesda, as restricting our panel to 10 markers still resulted in a sensitivity rate of 85% (data not shown). Furthermore, since our panel was based on recurrent mutations present in both CRC and EM, and since 50 out of 59 markers were located in UTRs, which are less likely to drive clonal selection and thus to represent tissue-specific events, it could be used to detect MSI in cancers affecting various tissues. Finally, since all markers were located in homopolymers \u226412 bps in length, they are, in contrast to the 25 or 26 bps markers from Bethesda, compatible with various low- to high-throughput genotyping technologies, thereby greatly facilitating their clinical adoption. For instance, we were able to multiplex all 59 markers in just five PCR amplification reactions compatible with Sequenom MassArray genotyping."

Although mutations in genes involved in this pathway, such as <i>MRE11A</i> or <i>RAD50</i>, have previously been reported in MMR-deficient tumors, these studies focused on specific mutations in individual genes rather than on pathways, and for this reason could establish that only a fraction of MMR-deficient tumors was affected by mutations in these genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Miquel et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, our study identified that every MMR-deficient tumors was affected by on average 3.3 somatic indels in the <i>DSBR by HR</i> pathway. Furthermore, although it is well established that cells deficient in BRCA1, BRCA2, Fanconi anemia, or other HR-related genes are hypersensitive to DSB inducers (<a href=\"#bib39\">Murai et al., 2012</a>), as for instance, synthetic lethality in BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient tumors through PARP inhibition is already approved as therapy in breast and ovarian cancer (<a href=\"#bib36\">Metzger-Filho et al., 2012</a>), data demonstrating sensitivity of MMR-deficient cells to DSB inducers have not been conclusive (<a href=\"#bib58\">Takahashi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vilar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Park et al., 2013</a>). For instance, although there are some reports highlighting the sensitivity of MSH3-deficient cell lines to DSB inducers, this appeared to occur through a non-canonical MMR pathway, as MLH1 was not involved in this process (<a href=\"#bib58\">Takahashi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Park et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, the only clinical study set-up so far to explore efficacy of PARP inhibitors as a single-agent therapy in previously treated patients with metastatic CRC stratified by MSI status, was unfortunately delayed due to patient accrual issues."

As a result of this double-hit, our ex vivo culture experiments are, however, difficult to compare to experiments relying on genotype-matched cells that have a single hit in the MMR or HR pathway. In addition, since <i>MMR</i> and <i>DSB by HR</i> pathway activities are not characterized in a clinical setting, it is difficult to relate our data to clinical studies assessing the outcome of therapeutics such as cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil, which have potential opposing activities on MMR- and HR-deficient tumors."

In particular, since on average 3.3 heterozygous loss-of-function mutations only partially inactivate the DSB repair by HR pathway (\u223c80% inactivation), it remains to be seen whether, compared to BRCA1 or BRCA2-deficient tumors, in which the HR pathway is completely inactivated, clinically relevant benefits are also achievable in MSI tumors. Possibly, only those MMR-deficient tumors containing large numbers of indels (\u22655) in the <i>DSBR by HR</i> pathway will show a significant response. Nevertheless, there is a great clinical need for novel treatment options in MSI tumors. Indeed, although stage II or III CRC tumors with MSI are characterized by a modestly improved prognosis, MSI tumors in the advanced setting are generally associated with a more peritoneal metastasis and a worse overall survival independent of the chemotherapy regimen (<a href=\"#bib55\">Smith et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yoon et al., 2013</a>). Our observations thus clearly warrant novel clinical studies assessing the therapeutic efficacy of DSB inducers in MMR-deficient tumors."

Random selection and validation of 24 indels occurring in 6 or more samples revealed a validation rate of 100%. Given the high validation rate for somatic indels per se, and the even higher rate for recurrent indels, we considered all recurrent indels as true-positives. Subsequent analyses were limited to indels recurrently affecting homopolymer regions, that is, 29,663 Illumina TruSeq-captured exonic homopolymers. Details of recurrent mutations in these homopolymers are available in <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 3</a>.

IHC analyses of these tumors were independently performed at the Molecular Cancer Epidemiology Laboratory in Brisbane, Australia as described (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tan et al., 2013</a>). 11 out of 236 tumors were excluded for the 59-marker panel due to their low tumor percentage (\u226410%). By varying the marker threshold, we calculated the number of true-positives and false-positives identified by our MSI panel relative to the IHC data. A ROC curve was constructed based on these values. The Matthew Correlation Coefficient of the ROC curve was calculated for each threshold. Tumors were considered MSI when they had three markers positive. We did not distinguish between MSI-low and microsatellite stable (MSS), as this is currently not clinically relevant. All tumors with less than three positive markers were thus considered MSS/MSI-L. For the Bethesda panel, we defined three categories as follows: microsatellite stable (MSS, 0 out of 10 markers), low microsatellite instability (MSI-L, 1\u20132 out of 10 markers), and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H, 3 or more out of 10 markers). Two sets of data (114 EM tumors and 97 CRC tumors) were used for the comparison. Details of these sample sets are given in <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>."

Indeed, different sequencing platforms are each characterized by their specific false-positive and false-negative variant detection rates. For example, 10.5% of indels was false-positive in Complete Genomics (CG) datasets, whereas 27.7% of indels was missed (false-negatives), as discussed by Zook et al (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jiricny, 2006</a>). For Illumina genomes, 6.9% of indels were false-positive and 0.5% of indels were false-negative."

                    "text": "First, to address the issue of false-positives (type 1 error), we expanded the number of randomly selected indels from the CG-sequenced MMR-deficient tumor (MMR-1) and Illumina-sequenced MMR-deficient tumor (MMR-2), respectively. We chose an orthogonal validation technology, i.e., Sequenom MassARRAY, to validate a total number of 391 indels. The overall validation rate that we obtained for indels was 90.3% in CG genomes and 85.9% in Illumina -sequenced genomes (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">table 1</a> below and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 3</a>). These validation rates are thus very similar between both platforms. The validation rates are also much higher than those that we observed for indels in MMR-proficient tumors and those the reviewer is correctly referring to in the literature (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parsons et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Peltomaki, 2014</a>). The low validation rates for indels in the MMR-proficient whole-genome tumors most probably reflect the fact that in germ-line genomes, as well as MMR -proficient tumor genomes, the number of true-positive indels is low in comparison to the number of false-positive indels that are detected. However, in MMR-deficient tumors, due to their specific hypermutator phenotype, the number of true-positive indels is vastly increased, thereby rendering the false positive fraction proportionally much smaller. In the revised manuscript, we have therefore highlighted the possibility of having false-positive and false-negative findings in the whole-genomes and indicate that this may affect observed indel rates. We also discuss that validation rates in MMR-deficient tumors are much higher than in the MMR-proficient tumors and explain the reasons for this. As highlighted by the reviewer, sequence reads containing both indels and substitutions (i.e., reads with a relatively high percentage of mismatches) are more prone to mismapping than sequence reads containing only substitutions or indels. We acknowledge this issue, and have in response deleted the paragraph describing that somatic indels and substitutions are often located close to each other in the 3 MMR-deficient tumors that were whole-genome sequenced. Indeed, such observations are prone to contamination by false-positives."

In particular, we repeated all analyses with only the 13 genomes subjected to Illumina exome-sequencing. We observed that in coding regions, 1.4% of homopolymers were affected at least once (i.e. in 2073 homopolymers out of a total of 29,663), whereas 414 were affected at least twice. Furthermore, 47 homopolymers were affected in \u22655 samples. In 3\u2019UTR and 5\u2019UTRs, 2296 and 105 homopolymers were affected in \u22655 samples respectively. When randomly selecting recurrent indels to design a panel of recurrent markers capable of assessing MSI, 54 out of the 59 originally selected markers were still selected, as they affected \u22655 out of 13 tumors (compared to 59 recurrent indels affecting \u22656 out of 16 tumors). Of these 54 markers, 45 markers were in UTRs and 9 were in coding regions.

For the EM tumors, 73 tumors (64%) were defined as MSS/MSI-L and 41 tumors (36%) as MSI-H. Out of these 41 MSI-H tumors, Bethesda identified 29 tumors as MSI-H (&gt;2 markers positive), 7 tumors as MSI-L and 5 tumors as MSS. Vice versa, Bethesda did not identify any MSI-H tumor that was not identified by our novel MSI panel (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1C</a>). IHC on 9 out of 12 discordant samples confirmed that each of these samples was deficient either for MLH1 or MSH2, and thus MMR-deficient. No tumor slides were available for the remaining 3 samples. The 9 discordant samples, we had access to, were confirmed as true positives by IHC. For CRC tumors, there were 97 MSS tumors in our 54-marker panel that were concordantly called MSS or MSI-L by the Bethesda panel. The remaining 29 samples were detected as MSI in the 54-marker panel (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1D</a>). 28 of these were also called MSI-H by the Bethesda panel, whereas one was called MSS by the Bethesda panel.
