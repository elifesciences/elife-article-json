Despite our knowledge that the brainstem-cerebellum plays an important role in motor error detection and motor learning, the involvement of neocortex remains largely unclear. Here, we report the neuronal computation and representation of saccadic error in macaque posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Neurons with persistent pre- and post-saccadic response (PPS) represent the intended end-position of saccade; neurons with late post-saccadic response (LPS) represent the actual end-position of saccade. Remarkably, after the arrival of the LPS signal, the PPS neurons\u2019 activity becomes highly correlated with the discrepancy between intended and actual end-position, and with the probability of making secondary (corrective) saccades. Thus, this neuronal computation might underlie the formation of saccadic error signals in PPC for speeding up saccadic learning and leading the occurrence of secondary saccade."

Despite our knowledge that the brainstem-cerebellum plays an important role in motor error detection and motor learning, the involvement of neocortex remains largely unclear. Here, we report the neuronal computation and representation of saccadic error in macaque posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Neurons with persistent pre- and post-saccadic response (PPS) represent the intended end-position of saccade; neurons with late post-saccadic response (LPS) represent the actual end-position of saccade. Remarkably, after the arrival of the LPS signal, the PPS neurons\u2019 activity becomes highly correlated with the discrepancy between intended and actual end-position, and with the probability of making secondary (corrective) saccades. Thus, this neuronal computation might underlie the formation of saccadic error signals in PPC for speeding up saccadic learning and leading the occurrence of secondary saccade."

This is true even for very well trained actions (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shadmehr et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, the brain must evolve efficient mechanisms to detect the motor errors between the intended and the executed actions for motor control, motor learning, spatial perception, and other motor-related cognitive functions."

In self-originated movements, the internal signals predict the displacement of motor effector (<a href=\"#bib6\">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Duhamel et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Helmholtz, 1925</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sommer and Wurtz, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sperry, 1950</a>), whereas the external sensory signals inform its actual position (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fuchs and Kornhuber, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sherrington, 1918</a>). Because the emergence of the sensory information lags the execution of the movement, it is believed that the motor errors in high velocity movements, such as saccades, are calculated by relying heavily on the internal signals (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kawato, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Robinson, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shadmehr et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wolpert et al., 1995</a>). Over the past three decades, the online control of saccades as well as saccadic learning can, in principle, be fully explained by the well-established models that reflect the properties of the brainstem-cerebellum machinery for saccades (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barash et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Catz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dash and Thier, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ito, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kawato et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nowak et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pasalar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Robinson, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shadmehr et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stein, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wolpert et al., 1998</a>).

Unexpectedly, we found the neuronal computation and representation of the saccadic error. One group of PPC neurons discharged persistently before and after saccades (PPS neurons). Another group of PPC neurons discharged purely post-saccadically (LPS neurons), starting to discharge ~70 ms after the completion of the saccade. A correlation analysis between the neuronal discharge and the end-position of the saccades suggested that the PPS neurons represented the intended end-position of the saccade (i.e., the location of the visual target) whereas the LPS neurons represented the actual end-position of the saccade. The PPS neurons started to decay their activities shortly after the increase of LPS neurons\u2019 activities, fitting the temporal request for comparing the motor intention and sensory input (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Furthermore, the activity of the PPS neurons shortly after the arrival of the LPS signal was highly correlated with the magnitude of saccadic error and the probability of making a secondary saccade. Interestingly, the activity level of PPS neurons during this period resembled the subtraction between the intended and the actual end-position signals."

In this task, monkeys chose one from two identical visual stimuli (left versus right visual field) as the saccadic target, based on the position of an additional visual cue either appearing to the left or right of the visual field. The memory-guided saccade task (MGS, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) was used to find the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) based on its physiological signature: neurons discharged persistently throughout the memory interval (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersen and Buneo, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Snyder et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang and Barash, 2004</a>). In total, we recorded 753 neurons, in which 377 out of 753 neurons showed significant pre-saccadic activity (pre-saccadic neurons) whereas 107 neurons showed significant pure post-saccadic activity (post-saccadic neurons). The neuronal data shown here were recorded from the same holes (0.5\u2009mm in diameter for each hole and 0.5\u2009mm between two holes) of a recording grid in which we recorded persistent response neurons in the MGS task. The reconstructed recording sites show that all neurons, but one, were recorded within a small area of 3x4 mm<sup>2</sup> in monkey B and 3x3 mm<sup>2</sup> in monkey D. Therefore, the neurons shown in this study were probably recorded mostly from the LIP. We identified a group of pre-saccadic response neurons (89 out of 377) that discharged persistently in both pre- and post-saccadic intervals (PPS) when saccades were directed to the response fields (preferred direction). We also identified another 27 neurons with late post-saccadic responses (LPS)."

All but seven neurons had significantly higher activity (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon test) in the preferred direction than in the non-preferred one. We further analyzed the correlation between the early post-saccadic activity (0\u2013100 ms after saccade end) and the pre-saccadic activity of PPS neurons. The distribution of correlation coefficient values based on single trial analysis of 89 PPS neurons is shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The results show that the pre-saccadic and the early post-saccadic activities were significantly and positively correlated in 34 of 89 neurons (p&lt;0.05, t-test), and this correlation was also observed in the population data (mean r = 0.2151, p&lt;0.001, paired t-test). Such results imply that the early post-saccadic activity of PPS neurons might encode similar information as the pre-saccadic activity did.

Overall, the correlation coefficient values of these 55 PPS neurons were symmetrically distributed around zero (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, mean r = 0.0132, p=0.5242, paired t-test), suggesting that their responses are not directly encoding the actual end-position of saccades. On a single neuron level, most PPS neurons (45 out of 55) were uncorrelated with the end-position of saccades, with the remaining 10 neurons reaching statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) but having inconsistent mixed positive and negative correlation: 4 were negatively correlated and 6 positively. Similar results were observed in 24 out of 27 PPS neurons that had enough trials for correlation analysis in the oblique SCS task (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). There was no significant correlation between the perisaccadic activity and the end-position of saccade either in the horizontal (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, mean r = \u22120.0209, p=0.4240, paired t-test) or in the vertical (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, mean r=0.0170, p=0.5245, paired t-test) direction of saccade end-positions.

However, we found that during the MGS task, the same PPS neurons were not visually responsive during the visual feedback after finishing saccades (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

The activity of an example LPS neuron in the SCS task is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, and the population activity of 27 such neurons is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. The activity of LPS neurons was spatially tuned. Comparing the post-saccadic activities (25~225 ms after saccade end) of individual LPS neurons between trials in which saccades were directed to the opposite directions, all but two LPS neurons showed stronger activities in one direction than in the other (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon test). We then assessed the possibility that the activity of LPS neurons could consistently encode the actual end-position of saccades. If single LPS neurons code (at least partly) linearly for the end-position, one would expect a significant correlation of their activity with the random jitter in the actual saccadic end-position. If the code were consistent across single LPS neurons, we would expect a consistent bias of the correlation in one direction (negative or positive). Thus, we analyzed the correlation between the activities of LPS neurons and the end-position of saccades on a single-trial basis. 22 of 24 LPS neurons were recorded with enough trials (&gt;30 trials in the preferred direction) when the monkeys performed the horizontal saccades. Indeed, we found that the distribution of the correlation coefficient values of these 22 LPS neurons was significantly biased to the positive direction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, mean r = 0.1237, p=0.0074, paired t-test). On a single neuron basis, we found that 18 out of 22 LPS neurons tended to be positively correlated with the end-position of saccades, with 5 reaching statistical significance (p&lt;0.05). Taken together, although subject to noise on a single neuron basis, our results show that, in contrast to the PPS neurons, the activity of LPS neurons was positively correlated with the actual end-position of saccades."

The correlation analysis between single PPS neuron activity and the magnitude of saccadic error (difference between the saccadic end-position and the target position) further confirmed this result.

Then, for trials with saccades ending at other locations, their activities were normalized by subtracting the activity in the reference condition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, blue and red lines). Consistent with the subtraction model, the absolute difference between the two regression fittings of normalized activities of PPS and LPS neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, purple dashed lines) clearly overlapped with the activity of PPS neurons in the late post-saccadic interval (150\u2013350 ms after saccade end) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, black lines). Moreover, the correlation between population activities of PPS neurons in the late post-saccadic interval and the magnitude of saccadic errors was significantly higher (p=0.0314, paired t-test) than the correlation with the end-position of saccade (mean r = 0.1134). It was also significantly higher (p=0.0023, paired t-test) than the correlation with the saccade amplitude (mean r = 0.0898). Thus, the level of the post-subtraction activity of PPS neurons was correlated positively with the discrepancy (error) between the intended (target location) and the actual end-position of saccade.

The sliding window started at 0 ms and stopped at 450 ms after saccade end.

The saccadic target remained visible in the SCS and CCS tasks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, D</a>) while the monkeys made saccades. More importantly, the end-positions of saccades for rewarded trials were distributed closely around the target as a Gaussian-like distribution with STD = 0.49\u00b0. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that monkeys did intend to make saccades to the target location. Here, we found a group of PPC neurons that discharged persistently in both pre- and post-saccadic epochs (PPS neurons). Although this perisaccadic activity exhibited significant difference between left and right saccades (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>), it was not correlated with the actual end-position of saccade (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, black). Therefore, we propose that the perisaccadic activity of PPS neurons represented the intended end-position of saccade (i.e., the location of the saccadic target) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Steenrod et al., 2013</a>)."

Such late post-saccadic activity unlikely represents the efference copy that emerges before the initiation of saccade (<a href=\"#bib20\">Helmholtz, 1925</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sherrington, 1918</a>). In contrast, the temporal profile of this LPS activity is very similar to the extraocular proprioceptive response reported previously (<a href=\"#bib38\">Prevosto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, for the following reasons, we believe that the activity of LPS neurons represents more likely the extraocular proprioceptive signal rather than the visual signal. Firstly, the LPS neurons did not have visual responses in all three oculomotor tasks. Secondly, when aligning the activity of LPS neurons at \u2018feedback on\u2019 in the MGS task (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), the activity increased even before the time of feedback stimulus onset. Thirdly, we previously reported that the extraocular proprioceptive signal rose up in the primary somatosensory cortex ~30 ms after the end of saccade (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2007</a>). In our case, the LPS neurons started to discharge ~70 ms after saccade (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>), indicating that the LPS neurons might encode an extraocular proprioceptive signal (<a href=\"#bib15\">Genovesio et al., 2007</a>)."

The post-subtraction activity of PPS neurons was correlated highly with the magnitude of saccadic error and with the probability of making a secondary saccade. Considering the fact that PPC is not directly involved in the control of saccadic eye movement (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Thier and Andersen, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wardak et al., 2002</a>), the saccadic error signal in PPC might function differently from the error signal that drives the premotor circuitry for saccade in the brainstem. One possible function may be the programming of a secondary saccade in case of the primary saccade missing the target. Our data show that the comparison between the intended and the actual end-position of saccade starts in PPC ~70 ms after the end of the primary saccade (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>), which is too late to influence the primary saccade but is early enough to control the secondary saccade (the latter has a latency of ~154 ms in average). Therefore, this parietal error signal may reflect the next of programming a secondary saccade, a possibility that is suggested by the correlation between secondary saccade probability and the post-subtraction activity of PPS neurons. In contrast, the brainstem-cerebellum models do not explain how a secondary saccade is planned."

The start of a saccade was defined as the time when the velocity exceeded 30\u00b0/s, and the end of a saccade was defined as the point at which the velocity became less than 10% of the peak velocity. Furthermore, trials were only included for further analysis if they fitted the following criteria: (1) the saccade duration was 10 to 100 ms; (2) the saccadic endpoint was within a 5\u00b0 window that was centered at the saccade target; (3) the saccadic amplitude was larger than 4\u00b0; and (4) the saccadic latency was shorter than 500 ms. Furthermore, we set different criteria for secondary saccade analysis: (1) the saccade duration was longer than 5 ms; (2) the minimum velocity for saccade onset was 8\u00b0/s; (3) the saccadic amplitude was larger than 0.2\u00b0; and (4) the secondary saccade occurred at least 100 ms after the end of the first large saccade. It has been reported that in human subjects, up to 20% of secondary saccades were not directed to the saccade target. These secondary saccades were also considered as secondary saccades (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morel et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we included all secondary saccades for further analysis.

This period ran from the peak activity point to a point after which the activity was lower than the peak activity by 2 STE, or 80% of peak activity; (5) Using an exponential function (y = A(1)*e(x/A(2))+A(3)) to fit the spike density function starting from each time point within the fluctuation period to the end point. The start point of the best fit, which had the minimum mean square residual error, was the activity decay time."

For instance, the actual saccade end-position signal (proprioceptive input) usually reaches the cortex with a delay of ~30 ms after a saccade completion (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). Since the monkeys might make secondary saccades at ~250 ms after the primary saccades, we chose a window, 25\u2013125 ms after saccade completion, to study the actual saccade end-position signal. The intended saccade end-position signal should appear before saccade initiation and last until the arrival of the actual eye position signal. Thus we chose a time window from 150 ms before to 100 ms after the saccade end to study the intentional signal. Finally, the error signal should be generated after the comparison of internal and external signals, we chose a window (150\u2013350ms after the saccade completion) for error signal analysis. Although varying the time interval may quantitatively change the results slightly, it will not change the major conclusions qualitatively."

The study uses three types of delayed saccade paradigms, spatial-cue delayed (SCS), memory-guided saccades (MGS) and color-cue delayed saccades (CCS), focusing on the relation between neurons firing both before and after the saccade and neurons that fire after the saccade."

The result leaves a reviewer confused and uncertain exactly what was done, the results and their implications. First is the paradigm. The critical arguments need to be based on the undershooting or overshooting of the target. However, the paradigm was not designed to produce these events, instead the study attempts to obtain that information based on the natural variation in saccade end point position. The analysis assumes that the monkey is always striving for the exact center of the target and, therefore the presaccadic firing does not vary with position but this is a big assumption and needs evidence to support. Without this implicit assumption, the critical analyses in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> break down. The study would be more convincing if position errors were explicitly controlled."

The major result is that the late activity of perisaccadic neurons seems to correspond to the difference between their early (presaccadic) response and the discharge of the postsaccadic neurons. Moreover, this difference measure and the late perisaccadic responses thought to represent the difference show an intriguing dependence on the final eye position. The dependence shows a minimum for the ideal position (i.e., for an eye position corresponding to target position) and increases with increasing deviation from this ideal in both directions. This result is intriguing! The dependence found is the one of an error representation suitable to drive corrections and eventually learning. Actually, it seems too specific to be an adventitious consequence of the many assumptions the authors have to make on their way to this particular result, assumptions whose biological significance one may question.

The major difference between the two is the fact that in the SCS, but not in the MGS paradigm, the saccade target was available all the time. In other words, I would assume that the peripheral visual cue (based on the target) must have contributed significantly to the response in the SCS task. Independent of this specific interpretation: why should a response component, which \u2013 according to the authors \u2013 reflects the prediction of the saccade-based change in eye position should differentiate between paradigms? Further: why should an efference copy related discharge show the conspicuous build up plus peak associated with the saccade? And why should it begin such a long time before the saccade?

I would guess that probably any oculomotor physiologist believes in the one or the other variant of Robinson saccade model in which the predicted momentary eye position is compared with the desired endpoint position and the difference is driving the saccade. Furthermore, the prediction is continuously updated based on error information, probably by cerebellar signals. This is a brainstem model with the superior colliculus representing the highest level. The neurons representing the prediction (i.e., the efference copy) in this model are the PPRF short-lead burst neurons whose discharge is precisely correlated with saccade kinematics, with a precision of msec. This model works perfectly without involving cortex, which would only disturb because of the unpleasant delays it would contribute. What I am trying to say is that in order to drive saccades, there is no need for the comparison of efference copy and actual eye position at the level of LIP. Such a comparison may take place, yet, the raison d\u00b4etre (e.g. perceptual purposes?) the authors have in mind should be presented much more clearly.

My concern had been that the two groups of neurons might actually be extreme fractions drawn from a continuous distribution. The fact that the two groups can be separated convincingly by a cluster analysis resolves this doubt. Yet, the result does not mean that these two groups of neurons are in positions allowing them to entertain the subtractive interaction the authors try to advocate. Where are the LPS and the PPS neurons located \u2013 are they intermingled, are they found in non-overlapping regions of posterior parietal cortex, perhaps even in different layers, is there any evidence for the kind of connection between them needed to support the suggested subtractive interaction between LPS and PPS neurons? All we learn is that these neurons were recorded from posterior parietal cortex. This is a large regions consisting of a number of well-defined areas. In other words, when I concluded \u2013 after having read the previous version of the manuscript \u2013 that the authors had studied one of these areas, area LIP, I was obviously wrong. I think what is missing is experimental data addressing the exact anatomical position and the question of the existence of true physiological interactions between LPS and PPS \u2013 e.g. based on multielectrode recordings that would allow the authors to look for functional interactions between simultaneously recorded PPS and LPS. Hence, my concern remains that the seeming representation of the error by the subtraction of the two may be an artifact of the many assumptions made like the pretty arbitrary choices of time windows, the choice of saccade amplitude classes etc. For instance, I do not see any a priori reason why the assumed subtractive comparison should be confined to the two time windows chosen by the authors. If the assumed subtractive interaction between PPS and LPS were more than wishful thinking it would be in any case continuous\u2026 Moreover, if the population difference really reflected the saccade error, it should represent the error independent of the amplitude of the primary saccade (at least to some extent\u2026). However, unfortunately, also this is not shown. Hence, I would say that the suggested subtractive interaction is a possibility but as yet far from being grounded on a solid experimental footing."

Actually, I feel a bit guilty having drawn the author's attention to work on the cerebellum in processing motor errors and adjusting motor behavior. The reason is that considerations of the cerebellum now take a lot of space in both the Introduction and the Discussion, yet without really contributing to the question why \u2013 in the first place \u2013 there may be need for a parietal representation of saccadic errors. My original point had been that the Robinson saccade model and any of the many alternatives we have seen over the years work successfully with an internal feedback circuit controlling saccades, circuitry that is purely subcortical. The desired saccade amplitude is represented by the SC \u2013 and perhaps LIP etc. Yet, I do not see why the desired saccade amplitude representation in cortex requires error feedback. The authors are mixing up the need to adapt the efference copy in a forward model based on sensory feedback and the question if there are any consequences for the original saccade plan. I am not saying that there cannot be a reason why cortex may want to be informed about the execution of the saccade plan. But all the evidence argues against a role in the online control of saccades. The authors need a clear concept \u2013 e.g. related to differences between short term and long-term learning, metalearning etc. Convincing considerations in this direction are completely lacking. I do not think that lengthy \u2013 and partially fallacious \u2013 considerations of motor error representations in cerebellar cortex can compensate this deficiency."

Only if they had varied target eccentricity (which they did not do) they might have been able to clarify if LPS neurons indeed encode amplitude as claimed. In any case, the next step in the argument is again confusing: in the population they find negative as well as positive correlations with a bias for the latter. This is the basis of the conclusion that the population encodes eye position. The implication of this conclusion is that negative correlations would not be compatible with position encoding, which is not correct.

Yet, the data does not allow one to decide whether this eye position signal is based on efference copy or proprioceptive feedback. However, already the Abstract talks about the latter. This is simply not correct. I agree that a proprioceptive signal may be possible or even likely in view of its demonstration elsewhere in parietal cortex. Yet, others have provided clear evidence for efference copy signals in posterior parietal cortex (e.g. the Andersen lab for reaching). From my point of view the authors should not make claims that are not justified and discuss the pros and cons honestly in the Discussion. In the Abstract and Introduction though they should be more neutral and use phrases such as eye position related etc. Actually dwelling on the nature of this signal in the Discussion would be much more valuable than the endless pages on motor errors and the role of the cerebellum in the Discussion and already earlier in the Introduction, sentences that do not contribute anything to an understanding of their findings and rather have the flavor of a poor \u2013 and occasionally simply wrong \u2013 review of a literature that they may not have fully understood. For instance, now we read in the Introduction that error encoding in parietal cortex may be needed in order to deal with the\u201ddifferent state of the extraocular muscles\". Well, this is exactly one of the well-established functions of a cerebellar forward model that is able to adjust the cerebellum-dependent efference copy in models of saccade control. And the adjustment is based on the climbing fibre system providing information on the error drawn from the SC as shown convincingly for instance by work coming from the Fuchs lab in Seattle.

No need to go into any details here. Then the authors might say that they studied parietal cortex and unexpectedly found an encoding of eye position and the saccade error. In the Discussion \u2013 after a short summary of the major finding and a discussion of the question of the nature of their eye position signal (efference copy vs. proprioception) they could then offer as an explanation of this unexpected finding that parietal cortex may be needed to encode the metrics of the secondary saccade, i.e. the correction saccade. After all, they show that the probability of corrective saccade is predicted by their parietal error signal\u2026 The brainstem models I alluded to do not explain how the secondary saccade is planned which is why a cortical contribution might indeed help. However, the authors should carefully check if the timing would be appropriate to encode a secondary saccade whose latency is very short. A second (not exclusive) idea may be that parietal error information might be used to speed up saccadic learning. We know that an understanding of the task and the resulting saccadic errors may help to update the internal image of the target allowing the subject to generate a more appropriate saccade next time. The consequence is that saccadic behavior may change from one trial to the next, rather than requiring many hundred trials if this knowledge is not available."

As reviewer 1 mentioned, the study was carried out under natural saccadic eye movements, rather than adaptive saccades (undershooting or overshooting to target). We think that there are at least two advantages comparing natural saccades to adaptive saccades. (1) In natural saccades, the intended eye position is matched with the location of saccadic target because the target is a static goal for an impending saccade. In contrast, the location of saccadic target is displaced after the initiation of a saccade in the adaptive saccades. Therefore, it is not clear whether the intended saccade directs to the pre-saccadic target or the post-saccadic target. (2) In the real life, we make much more nature saccades than adaptive saccades. Thus, studying the neuronal representation of saccadic error computation under nature saccade condition will shed light on understanding the neuronal computation of motor errors."

In the present study, saccadic target remained visible in SCS and CCS tasks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, C</a>) while monkeys made saccades. Monkeys were intensively trained for years to make saccade to a small target (0.2\u00b0) within a 3\u00b0 checking window. In fact, our behavioral data showed that the post-saccadic eye position of rewarded trials distributed around the target position similar as a Gaussian distribution (insert histogram in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B, C</a>). Thus, we believe that, under SCS and CCS task conditions, monkeys intended to make saccades to the location of target. Consistently, we recorded a group of PPC neurons that persistently discharged in both pre- and post-saccadic epochs (PPS neurons), and this perisaccadic activity was not correlated with the real post-saccadic eye position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

It is then claimed in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> that the same is true for individual cell firing (subsection \u201cThe pre- and postsaccadic response neurons behave like a subtraction operator that measure the discrepancy between predicted and actual eye position signals\u201d, second paragraph). However, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> shows that the p-value for the vast majority of the cells is &gt; 0.05. At best, 2 or 3 cells had a correlation coefficient that reached statistical significance. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients are equally distributed between positive and negative for the included cells in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, yet there is an overall positive relationship between post-saccadic activity and position in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>. These discrepancies seem very hard to reconcile. While assessing the possibility of the late post-saccadic activity encoding the real post-saccadic eye position, we analyzed the correlation between the post-saccadic activity and the end point of saccade for each later postsaccadic response neurons (LPS) on single trial basis. 22 of 24 LPS neurons were recorded with enough trials (&gt;= 30 trials in the preferred direction) in horizontal saccades. Although only 3 out of 22 individual neurons had a correlation coefficient that reached statistical significance (p&lt;0.05), in population the distribution of the correlation coefficient values was significantly biased to the positive direction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, mean r = 0.1028, p=0.0087, paired t-test).

They also propose that larger error signal correlates with greater probability of corrective saccades.

It is often not clear what question is being addressed.

The major difference between the two is the fact that in the SCS, but not in the MGS paradigm, the saccade target was available all the time.

I would guess that probably any oculomotor physiologist believes in the one or the other variant of Robinson saccade model in which the predicted momentary eye position is compared with the desired endpoint position and the difference is driving the saccade. Furthermore, the prediction is continuously updated based on error information, probably by cerebellar signals. This is a brainstem model with the superior colliculus representing the highest level. The neurons representing the prediction (i.e., the efference copy) in this model are the PPRF short-lead burst neurons whose discharge is precisely correlated with saccade kinematics, with a precision of msec. This model works perfectly without involving cortex, which would only disturb because of the unpleasant delays it would contribute. What I am trying to say is that in order to drive saccades, there is no need for the comparison of efference copy and actual eye position at the level of LIP. Such a comparison may take place, yet, the raison d\u00b4etre (e.g. perceptual purposes?) the authors have in mind should be presented much more clearly. As yet, I do not see a compelling concept and I do not see a need for control purposes."

Another example is in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> in which the correlation between post-saccadic activity of single LPS neurons and eye position is 0.10, or 0.01% of the variability. However, that is an issue best decided by the wider scientific community. We reduced the minimum saccade amplitude of primary saccade from 6 degrees to 4 degrees, in order to include trials with large saccadic error. In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, 43 out of 56 PPS neurons showed positive correlation between post-subtraction activity and saccadic error, and 19 of these neurons reached statistical significance.

We do realize that, in our data, the CC value of single PPS neuron\u2019s activity and postsaccadic eye position was relatively low.

If the assumed subtractive interaction between PPS and LPS were more than wishful thinking it would be in any case continuous\u2026 Moreover, if the population difference really reflected the saccade error, it should represent the error independent of the amplitude of the primary saccade (at least to some extent\u2026). However, unfortunately, also this is not shown. Hence, I would say that the suggested subtractive interaction is a possibility but as yet far from being grounded on a solid experimental footing.</i> Theoretically, to render the comparison between saccadic plan and sensory feedback possible, the saccadic plan signal should rise up before the initiation of saccade and last until the arrival of the sensory signals after the completion of saccade (External error detector in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Based on this assumption, if PPS neurons represent the intended eye position signal, the most important timing is the perisaccadic interval. Therefore, we chose a perisaccadic window (150 ms before to 100 ms after saccade end) to analyze the correlation between the activity of PPS neurons and saccadic errors. On the other hand, the generation of sensory feedback (actual eye position signal) is after the initiation of saccade. To make the comparison between intended and actual eye position signals possible, the comparison should be made before the fully declination of the activity of PPS neurons. Therefore, we selected a time window (25-125ms after saccade end) to analyze the correlation between actual eye position signal and saccadic errors.

Nevertheless, we also recorded the behavioral and neuronal data when monkeys made saccades to the visual targets in the oblique direction at 13\u00b0 eccentricity in the SCS task.

In order to show that this is not the case, they resort to a comparison with the memory saccade paradigm in which no peripheral saccade target is fovealized. However, rather than considering the saccade-related activity (which is non-visual) they look at the earlier visual response evoked in this paradigm. Why? I do not see that this addresses the aforementioned question.

In the figure the memory-guided saccade activity is synchronized on the reappearance of the target (i.e., \u201cfeedback on\u201d in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), now at the fovea. There is no response at this time, although there was a presaccadic burst that ended before the reappearance of the foveal target.

Only if they had varied target eccentricity (which they did not do) they might have been able to clarify if LPS neurons indeed encode amplitude as claimed. In any case, the next step in the argument is again confusing: in the population they find negative as well as positive correlations with a bias for the latter.
