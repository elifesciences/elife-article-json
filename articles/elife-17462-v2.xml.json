We show that Klf5 is also an essential mediator of skeletal muscle regeneration and myogenic differentiation. During muscle regeneration after injury (cardiotoxin injection), Klf5 was induced in the nuclei of differentiating myoblasts and newly formed myofibers expressing myogenin <i>in vivo</i>. Satellite cell-specific <i>Klf5</i> deletion severely impaired muscle regeneration, and myotube formation was suppressed in <i>Klf5</i>-deleted cultured C2C12 myoblasts and satellite cells. <i>Klf5</i> knockdown suppressed induction of muscle differentiation-related genes, including myogenin. Klf5 ChIP-seq revealed that Klf5 binding overlaps that of MyoD and Mef2, and Klf5 physically associates with both MyoD and Mef2. In addition, MyoD recruitment was greatly reduced in the absence of Klf5. These results indicate that Klf5 is an essential regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation, acting in concert with myogenic transcription factors such as MyoD and Mef2."

We show that Klf5 is also an essential mediator of skeletal muscle regeneration and myogenic differentiation. During muscle regeneration after injury (cardiotoxin injection), Klf5 was induced in the nuclei of differentiating myoblasts and newly formed myofibers expressing myogenin <i>in vivo</i>. Satellite cell-specific <i>Klf5</i> deletion severely impaired muscle regeneration, and myotube formation was suppressed in <i>Klf5</i>-deleted cultured C2C12 myoblasts and satellite cells. <i>Klf5</i> knockdown suppressed induction of muscle differentiation-related genes, including myogenin. Klf5 ChIP-seq revealed that Klf5 binding overlaps that of MyoD and Mef2, and Klf5 physically associates with both MyoD and Mef2. In addition, MyoD recruitment was greatly reduced in the absence of Klf5. These results indicate that Klf5 is an essential regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation, acting in concert with myogenic transcription factors such as MyoD and Mef2."

Regeneration of adult skeletal muscle following injury occurs through the mobilization of satellite cells (SCs), a population of injury-sensitive quiescent muscle stem cells that activate, proliferate, differentiate, and fuse with injured myofibers. (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buckingham and Rigby, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</a>). In an adult skeletal muscle, SCs, characterized by expression of the paired box transcription factor Pax7 are mitotically quiescent and reside in a niche between the basal lamina and sarcolemma of associated muscle fibers. In response to muscle damage, SCs are activated and assume a myoblast identity, thereby initiating muscle repair. After massive proliferation, SC-derived myoblasts undergo differentiation and fusion to form myotubes that replace the damaged myofibers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Comai and Tajbakhsh, 2014</a>), while a subset of activated satellite cells downregulate MyoD, exit the cell cycle to replenish the muscle stem cell pool."

These MRFs include the myogenic basic-helix-loop-helix type transcription factors MyoD and Myf5, which are recruited to skeletal muscle-specific genes regulatory regions, where they determine myogenic fate and initiate the differentiation cascade. Thereafter, MyoD increases the expression of late target genes in cooperation with myogenin and MRF4 through a feed-forward regulatory mechanism that regulates terminal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Penn et al., 2004</a>). MRFs also enhance myogenic activity by interacting with other transcription factors, including Mef2 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fong and Tapscott, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Molkentin and Olson, 1996</a>)."

It is highly likely, for example, that the myogenic program driven by MRFs requires input from other transcription factors. More specifically, MRFs, including MyoD, may associate with other transcription factors that respond to microenvironmental cues and restrict the binding of MRFs to particular subsets of target enhancers. This would enable MRF complexes to context dependently regulate muscle genes governing the processes of myocyte differentiation and regeneration. Identification of these MRF partners is therefore important to clarify the mechanism by which MRF-containing transcriptional regulatory complexes achieve precise spatiotemporal regulation of their target genes."

All Klf proteins contain a DNA-binding domain consisting of three zinc fingers positioned at their carboxyl-terminal end, which enables their specific binding to 'GT-box' or 'CACCC' sites (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bieker, 2001</a>). Several Klf members are involved in the control of skeletal muscle differentiation and function (<a href=\"#bib37\">Prosdocimo et al., 2015</a>). For instance, Klf3 is upregulated during skeletal muscle differentiation and transactivates the muscle creatin kinase (<i>Mck</i>) promoter (<a href=\"#bib22\">Himeda et al., 2010</a>). Klf2 and Klf4 are also upregulated in differentiating muscle cells and promote muscle cell fusion (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sunadome et al., 2011</a>). Klf6 promotes and Klf10 inhibits myoblast proliferation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dionyssiou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Parakati and DiMario, 2013</a>). Klf15 critically regulates skeletal muscle nutrient catabolism, contributing to the regulation of exercise capacity and muscle wasting (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gray et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haldar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shimizu et al., 2011</a>). These studies demonstrate the pivotal involvement of Klfs in muscle biology. However, their role in the global transcriptional program of muscle differentiation remains unclear. Interestingly, Cao et al. previously showed that binding sites for Sp1, which is structurally related to Klfs and binds to similar GC-rich sequences, are highly enriched in MyoD-binding regions, which suggests there may be interaction between these two transcription factors."

Klf5 is expressed in many cell types, including gut epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chanchevalap et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sun et al., 2001</a>), vascular smooth muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fujiu et al., 2005</a>), adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Oishi et al., 2005</a>), neuronal cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yanagi et al., 2008</a>) and leukocytes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yang et al., 2003</a>).

Klf5 is also required for adipocyte differentiation. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, Klf5 is induced at an early stage of differentiation by C/EBP\u03b2 and \u03b4, which is followed by expression of PPAR\u03b3<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Oishi et al., 2005</a>). We previously reported that Klf5 acts as a regulator of lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib33\">Oishi et al., 2008</a>).

This effect occurred concomitantly with decreased expression of myogenin and MyHC on day 4 of differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). To determine whether forced expression of Klf5 could rescue the compromised differentiation of <i>Klf5</i>-null clones, Klf5 was exogenously introduced using a retrovirus harboring murine Klf5 (RV-Klf5). <i>Klf5</i>-null C2C12 cells transfected with RV-Klf5 successfully formed myotubes when stimulated to differentiate, whereas <i>Klf5</i>-null cells infected with an empty retrovirus failed to do so (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In addition, immunohistochemistry and western blotting demonstrated that expression of MyHC and myogenin was partially rescued by the forced expression of Klf5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>).

Analysis of MyoD binding sites using previously reported MyoD ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) of C2C12 myotubes differentiated for 2 days (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 2010</a>) revealed that among the Refseq genes, 753 that contained nearby sites bound by MyoD were upregulated by &gt;two-fold on day 3 as compared with day 0. These genes are most likely direct MyoD targets and are highly enriched with myogenesis-related genes. The effect of <i>Klf5</i> knockdown on the expression of MyoD-regulated genes became more pronounced as the course of differentiation proceeded (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), and expression of those MyoD-regulated genes on day 3 was significantly decreased by <i>Klf5</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>). This distinct pattern of gene expression is exemplified by <i>Myog</i> and <i>Myl4</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that expression of MyoD-regulated genes, as exemplified by <i>Myog, Mybph, Myl4</i> and <i>Myom2</i>, was significantly decreased by <i>Klf5</i> knockdown in C2C12 cells on day 3 post-differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). This indicates that Klf5 is required for expression of these MyoD-regulated genes. Remarkably, <i>de novo</i> motif analysis revealed that the top motifs in the MyoD-bound cistrome included ones closely matched with known consensus myogenin (E-box), Mef2 and Klf5 binding motifs, which suggests potential co-localization of MyoD, Mef2 and Klf5 at MyoD-regulated enhancers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Cao et al. previously showed that the motif for Sp1 is enriched in regions bound by MyoD (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al, 2010</a>). The previously identified Sp1 motif contains a core 5\u2019-CCGCCC-3\u2019 sequence, which matches a subset of the Klf motif ranked as 4th in our de novo motif analysis. This suggests the Sp1 motif may also be enriched. Indeed, enrichment analysis of a known Sp1 motif showed that the Sp1 motif is enriched in the MyoD binding regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>)."

In addition, we used published ChIP-seq data to analyzed the binding sites of Mef2D in C2C12 myotube on day 5, the major Mef2 isoform involved in expression of late muscle-specific genes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sebastian et al., 2013</a>).

In addition, the compromised myogenic phenotype observed in <i>Klf5</i> knockout SCs and C2C12 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>), and the reduction in the fraction of MyoD-regulated gene expression induced by <i>Klf5</i> knockdown in differentiating C2C12 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), also suggest Klf5 affects MyoD-dependent gene regulation. To test whether Klf5 is required for recruitment of MyoD to target sites, we performed ChIP-seq of MyoD in <i>Klf5-</i>null and GFP-targeted control C2C12 myotubes to determine the effects of the <i>Klf5</i> deletion on the MyoD cistrome.

In particular, many of the transcription factors that control embryonic myogenesis also contribute to adult regenerative myogenesis. When a muscle is injured, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), released from the basal lamina of the injured muscle triggers SC activation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tatsumi et al., 1998</a>). The activated SCs migrate and rapidly proliferate to give rise to Pax7<sup>+</sup>Myf5<sup>+</sup> cells, which activate the MRF cascade (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cooper et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kuang et al., 2007</a>). Our present results indicate that Klf5 is induced in myoblast-committed, non-dividing Pax7<sup>low</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup> SCs after they are triggered to differentiate into myocytes. Likewise, <i>Klf5</i> mRNA remained low in C2C12 myoblasts and SCs cultured in growth media. <i>Klf5</i> is greatly upregulated only after switching to differentiation media (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). In differentiating myoblasts Klf5 is required for expression of <i>Myog</i> and muscle-specific genes. Given that Klf5 enhances binding of MyoD to its target sites, these findings collectively suggest that Klf5 is an important regulator that links the early specification program driven by MyoD and Myf5 to the late myotube formation and maturation program driven by myogenin and Mrf4."

                        "text": "To further elucidate the regulatory function of Klf5 in myogenesis, it will be important to determine how Klf5 expression is induced during myocyte differentiation and regeneration. Klf5 is reportedly induced in response to external/endogenous stimuli through various signaling cascades, including p38MAPK (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nandan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Oishi et al., 2010</a>), ERK1/2 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kawai-Kowase et al., 1999</a>) and IL-1\u03b2/HIF-1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mori et al., 2009</a>). We previously showed that the p38MAPK pathway controls upregulation of Klf5 in response to angiotensin II in smooth muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oishi et al., 2010</a>). The p38MAPK pathway is activated immediately after the onset of myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2007</a>), and is essential for myoblast differentiation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gonzalez et al., 2004</a>). Moreover, genome-wide transcriptome analysis of SCs with muscle-specific p38\u03b1 deletion or C2C12 cells treated with a p38 MAPK inhibitor revealed that p38\u03b1 is responsible for induction of Klf5 during myoblast differentiation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Segales et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, that study also showed that inhibiting p38 signaling does not affect expression of MyoD. It therefore seems likely that Klf5 is an essential component of the transcriptional machinery activated by p38 MAPK during myogenic differentiation. A previous study showed that Klf2 and Klf4 are induced by ERK5 signaling and contribute to muscle cell fusion (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sunadome et al., 2011</a>). Microarray analyses in that study indicate that Klf5 expression is not affected by inhibition of ERK5 signaling (GSE25827). This is in agreement with our previous observations that Klf5 expression was unaffected by a MEK inhibitor in smooth muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oishi et al., 2010</a>). These findings indicate that members of Kr\u00fcppel-like factor family differentially contribute to different processes during muscle differentiation and maturation. That said, it is possible that the loss of Klf5 is compensated by other Klf members, as we observed modest changes in the expression of other Klfs in Klf5-deficient C2C12 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Future studies of possible cooperation and competition among Klf members will be important for elucidating their functional roles in muscle biology. In addition, we found that exogenous Klf5 increased the level of eMyHC in Klf5-deleted C2C12 myotubes, but did not fully recapitulate the normal level of eMyHC expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This insufficient rescue may reflect differences between endogenous and exogenous Klf5, including the levels and timing of Klf5 expression. In the control cells, for example, Klf5 was transiently upregulated early during differentiation, but this temporal regulation of Klf5 was lost in cells in which exogenous Klf5 was stably expressed. Future studies will also need to address the temporal regulation of Klf members during muscle differentiation and regeneration."

This demonstrates that Klf5 is required for formation of MyoD-containing transcriptional regulatory complexes in at least a subset of the MyoD cistrome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Recent studies have identified several transcription factors that interact with MyoD. For instance, Runx1 is induced in response to muscle injury and acts cooperatively with MyoD and c-Jun to regulate muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib49\">Umansky et al., 2015</a>). TEAD4 is another factor reportedly recruited and bound to the locus also occupied by MyoD during the course of myogenic differentiation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Benhaddou et al., 2012</a>). Inhibition of Runx1 or TEAD4 suppresses myogenic differentiation and regeneration, suggesting those two transcription factors, together with MyoD, are necessary to drive muscle regeneration. Of interest, we observed the sequence motif bound by Runx to rank 4th and the MCAT motif bound by TEAD4 to rank 6th among the de novo motifs identified in regions bound by Klf5 in myotubes differentiated for 5 days (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and data not shown). These data suggest that Klf5 promotes myogenic differentiation by interacting with multiple transcription factors, including MyoD, Mef2, Runx1 and TEAD4. It is likely these transcription factors are differentially regulated in response to different environmental cues and/or endogenous signaling. Accordingly, the interplay between these multiple factors would enable spatiotemporal regulation and fine tuning of muscle-related gene expression. It would be important to further clarify the logic of transcriptional regulation by these multiple transcription factors. It would also be worth noting that there appears to be a complex cross-regulation of the expression of these factors. For instance, in addition to myogenin, Klf5 appears to regulate TEAD4 because there were Klf5 binding peaks in the vicinity of the genes in our ChIP-seq, and <i>Klf5</i> knockdown reduced TEAD4 levels (data not shown). In addition, based on a published microarray analysis of effects of an individual Mef2 isoform (GSE63798) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Estrella et al., 2015</a>) and our results from smooth muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oishi et al., 2010</a>), it appears Klf5 is regulated by Mef2A. This reciprocal regulation of Klf5 and other myogenic transcription factors support the notion that Klf5 is a component of an intricate transcription factor network that regulates muscle differentiation and regeneration."

                        "text": "In addition to MyoD and Mef2 identified in the present study, Klf5 has been shown to interact with various other transcription factors and cofactors. For instance we showed that Klf5 interacts with C/EB\u0392\u03b2 and \u03b4 to regulate adipocyte differentiation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Oishi et al., 2005</a>), interacts with PPAR\u03b4 to regulate lipid metabolic genes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Oishi et al., 2008</a>), and interacts with C/EBP\u03b1 to control the response to renal injury (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fujiu et al., 2011</a>). Klf5 also interacts with unliganded RAR/RXR to induce phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fujiu et al., 2005</a>). By taking advantage of this mechanism, we showed that an RAR agonist can inhibit induction of Klf5 target genes, thereby suppressing smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointima formation. We may therefore be able to manipulate the muscle regeneration program by altering the activity of Klf5 through its interacting partners. In sum, our results provide evidence that during skeletal muscle regeneration and myoblast differentiation, Klf5 regulates the expression of late muscle-specific genes in concert with MyoD and Mef2. This finding suggests that it will be of interest to investigate this pathway further with respect to the control of muscle regeneration. It would also be interesting to know whether Klf5-mediated pathways are involved in such pathological conditions as sarcopenia."

For MyoD ChIP in CRISPR-engineered cells, cells differentiated for 3 days were used. Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10\u2009min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125\u2009M and incubating for 10\u2009min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cell pellet was lysed in ice-cold Cell Lysis Buffer, incubated on ice for 10\u201320\u2009min and centrifuged at 3000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was further lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer and incubated on ice for 10\u2009min. The resultant cell lysate was sonicated using an ultrasonicator (output 50, 30-s pulses then 1-min pause \u00d7 13 times; UD-100: TOMY Seiko, Tokyo, Japan). The chromatin was then pre-cleared by incubating with Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma- Aldrich) for 2\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C with constant rotation. After centrifugation, anti-MyoD or anti-Klf5 antibody was added and rotated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Protein A-Sepharose 4B fast flow (BD) was then added and incubated for 1\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C with constant rotation. Thereafter, the beads were washed 4 times with RIPA buffer, 6 times with LiCl buffer and 3 times with TE buffer, then eluted with 2% SDS solution. After reverse cross-linking at 65\u00b0C overnight, the chromatin immunoprecipitate and Input were treated with RNase (37\u00b0C, 1\u2009hr) and Proteinase K (42\u00b0C, 1\u2009hr). The recovered chromatin was purified using a MiniElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) and used for real-time PCR analysis."

Reads were mapped to the mm9 genome using STAR (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dobin et al., 2013</a>). Peak calling and annotation was performed using HOMER version 4 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heinz et al., 2010</a>) for MyoD and Klf5, and using MACS2 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>) for Mef2D. Peaks that overlapped blacklisted regions (<a href=\"#bib9\">ENCODE\u00a0Project\u00a0Consortium, 2012</a>) or simple repeat regions were removed. Homer-identified MyoD and Klf5 peaks with scores \u226520 were considered high confidence binding sites and used for further analyses, except for detection of MyoD peaks in the vicinity of Klf5 peaks in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. To make a set of potential MyoD-regulated genes, RefSeq genes that contained MyoD peaks within a region \u22121500 bp from TSS to +1500 bp from TTS were first chosen. Then genes whose normalized counts were increased \u22652-fold in C2C12 myotubes relative to those in myoblasts were selected. The resultant MyoD target gene set contained 753 RefSeq genes. This gene set was highly enriched in GO terms related to muscle differentiation. All RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data are available in the GEO under the accession number GSE80812. To identify enriched motifs in ChIP-seq peaks, we used Homer\u2019s findMotifsGenome.pl software (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heinz et al., 2010</a>)."

Accordingly, we further analyzed the relationship between Klf5 and MyoD binding regardless the distance to genes. A new heatmap for Klf5, MyoD and Mef2D binding around the center of the top 1000 Klf5 binding peaks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) show that at the Klf5 peaks in myotubes (day 5) that had significant nearby MyoD peaks, Klf5 binding were increased during differentiation (day 0 to 5), which is evident in histograms of Klf5 binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This co-association of MyoD and Klf5 is also shown by the histogram of Klf5 binding around the center of the MyoD peaks, in which Klf5 binding was increased as differentiation progressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) In sharp contrast, a smaller fraction of top 1000 Klf5 peaks in myoblasts (day 0) had nearby MyoD peaks, and Klf5 binding was unchanged or decreased during differentiation (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results suggest there are two subsets of Klf5 binding sites: those with increasing Klf5 binding during differentiation and those with decreasing Klf5 binding. The former is more strongly related to adjacent MyoD binding, while the latter is less associated with MyoD binding. Because of cooperation between Klf5 and MyoD during differentiation, <i>Klf5</i> deletion might have a stronger impact on the MyoD binding sites associated with increasing Klf5 binding. Indeed, <i>Klf5</i> deletion markedly reduced MyoD binding at the MyoD binding sites with increased Klf5 binding on day 5 as compared with that on day 0 (&gt;4-fold increased Klf5 counts within 400 bp around the center of MyoD binding peak), whereas <i>Klf5</i> deletion did not affect MyoD binding at the MyoD sites with decreased Klf5 binding (&gt;4-fold decreased Klf5 counts) (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1C</a>). These results demonstrate that <i>Klf5</i> deletion has a strong impact on the sites with increasing association with Klf5 and MyoD, and support the notion that Klf5 and MyoD cooperatively proceed during the muscle differentiation program. Though these analyses support our conclusions, extensive ChIP-seq and chromosome conformation capture analyses will be needed to further clarify relationships between enhancer activity and Klf5/MyoD binding, and enhancer activity and gene transcription. Moreover, the present study focuses on the Klf5\u2019s function in myogenesis and regeneration. Accordingly, while we have added heatmaps of Klf5, MyoD and Mef2D and briefly discussed the increasing co-association of Klf5 and MyoD in differentiation, we decided not to add the analyses shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>."

By contrast, Cao et al. used three antibodies developed in their lab that recognized amino acids 160-307, 60-219 and 3-318 of mouse MyoD (Cao Y et al. Dev Cell18: 662, Tapscott, SJ et al.

The observation that the lack of <i>Klf5</i> reduces MyoD binding was reproduced in the independent experiment, verifying that impaired MyoD recruitment reflects biological differences, but not a difference in the quality of MyoD ChIPs in control and <i>Klf5</i> knockout cells.

Still, as pointed out, expression of many genes was unchanged or increased. The precise reason why MyoD binding was globally decreased while expression of many MyoD target genes was not decreased is not immediately clear. One possible explanation is that other MRFs, such as Myf5, compensate for the functional defect of MyoD, as recently published by Conerly M et al. (Dev Cell36:375, 2016). It is also possible that MyoD is dispensable for enhancer activity. Among the 753 MyoD-target genes depicted as red points in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, expression of 55 genes was increased by &gt;1.5-fold, and 246 genes were decreased by &gt;1.5-fold. MyoD binding to regions proximal (+/- 1.5 kb of gene) to those upregulated and downregulated genes was similarly decreased in <i>Klf5</i> knockout cells (please see <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2A</a>). Interestingly, however, Klf5 binding to MyoD sites near MyoD-target genes upregulated by <i>Klf5</i> deletion was much lower than to sites near downregulated genes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2B</a>). This lesser association of Klf5 with MyoD-containing enhancers is also illustrated by the heatmap for Klf5 and MyoD binding around the center of the MyoD-binding sites (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2C</a>). These results suggest that the enhancers near the upregulated MyoD-target genes are likely to be indirectly affected by the loss of <i>Klf5</i>, though the precise regulatory mechanisms affecting the enhancer activity are not immediately clear. Given our current findings demonstrating the mechanistic importance of Klf5 on MyoD recruitment, we feel exploring this further is beyond the scope of the present paper, and that these issues should be addressed in our future studies. We thank the reviewers for these constructive comments."
