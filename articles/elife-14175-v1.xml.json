This symptom results from accumulation of porphyrins, tetrapyrrole intermediates in heme biosynthesis that generate reactive oxygen species when exposed to light, in the skin of affected individuals. Here we report that in addition to producing an ommochrome body pigment, the planarian flatworm <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> generates porphyrins in its subepithelial pigment cells under physiological conditions, and that this leads to pigment cell loss when animals are exposed to intense visible light. Remarkably, porphyrin biosynthesis and light-induced depigmentation are enhanced by starvation, recapitulating a common feature of some porphyrias \u2013 decreased nutrient intake precipitates an acute manifestation of the disease. Our results establish planarians as an experimentally tractable animal model for research into the pathophysiology of acute porphyrias, and potentially for the identification of novel pharmacological interventions capable of alleviating porphyrin-mediated photosensitivity or decoupling dieting and fasting from disease pathogenesis."

This symptom results from accumulation of porphyrins, tetrapyrrole intermediates in heme biosynthesis that generate reactive oxygen species when exposed to light, in the skin of affected individuals. Here we report that in addition to producing an ommochrome body pigment, the planarian flatworm <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> generates porphyrins in its subepithelial pigment cells under physiological conditions, and that this leads to pigment cell loss when animals are exposed to intense visible light. Remarkably, porphyrin biosynthesis and light-induced depigmentation are enhanced by starvation, recapitulating a common feature of some porphyrias \u2013 decreased nutrient intake precipitates an acute manifestation of the disease. Our results establish planarians as an experimentally tractable animal model for research into the pathophysiology of acute porphyrias, and potentially for the identification of novel pharmacological interventions capable of alleviating porphyrin-mediated photosensitivity or decoupling dieting and fasting from disease pathogenesis."

For example, porphyrins deposited in the skin can cause swelling and blistering when the skin is exposed to bright light. Other disease symptoms include neurological issues ranging from anxiety and confusion to seizures or paralysis.

Stubenhaus et al. found that <i>S. mediterranea</i> makes porphyrins in the pigment cells of its skin using the same genes that make porphyrins in humans. Together with other molecules called ommochromes, the porphyrins give rise to the normal color of this flatworm. However, when the animals are exposed to intense light for extended periods of time, which is unlikely to occur in the wild, porphyrin production leads to loss of the pigment cells."

Further research is required to determine the exact chemical structure of the porphyrin and ommochrome molecules produced in different flatworm species.

Although naturally occurring auxotrophs have been reported (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rao et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gruss et al., 2012</a>), heme is usually synthesized from the precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, ALA is produced in the mitochondria via condensation of glycine and succinyl CoA by ALA synthase (ALAS). This is the first and typically rate-limiting step in the heme biosynthesis pathway, which proceeds in the cytoplasm before returning to the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib35\">Layer et al., 2010</a>). Like ALAS, the enzymes catalyzing the 7 remaining reactions in the pathway are tightly regulated by ubiquitous and tissue-specific mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ponka, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Balwani and Desnick, 2012</a>)."

These conditions are marked by characteristic clinical features \u2013 neurovisceral symptoms, skin lesions, or both (<a href=\"#bib26\">Karim et al., 2015</a>). While potentially attributable at least in part to heme deficiency, the primary etiology of these symptoms entails a buildup of pathway intermediates due to the bottleneck effect created by underlying mutations. ALA, and possibly also its pyrrole derivative porphobilinogen (PBG), is neurotoxic (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pierach and Edwards, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adhikari et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Felitsyn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bissell et al., 2015</a>). Porphyrins cause cutaneous abnormalities by virtue of their photosensitizing properties. Though generated primarily in the liver or bone marrow, the major sites of heme biosynthesis, they are eventually deposited in other tissues including the dermis. There, they readily absorb light to enter an excited triplet state that reacts with oxygen to produce singlet oxygen. This in turn results in oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, that can ultimately lead to cell death (<a href=\"#bib58\">Poh-Fitzpatrick, 1986</a>). Thus, sunlight, or even bright indoor light, quickly damages exposed skin in many porphyria patients. Clinically, porphyrin-mediated phototoxicity manifests as edema, blistering skin lesions, and in extreme cases, disfiguring scarring and/or tissue loss (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balwani and Desnick, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Karim et al., 2015</a>)."

These episodes, which can last for weeks, are triggered by drugs (e.g., barbiturates), hormonal changes, dieting/fasting, and other factors that induce hepatic ALAS expression or activity. Accordingly, they are treated with therapies that effect ALAS downregulation. Carbohydrate loading reduces ALAS levels via insulin signaling and an antagonistic effect on its transcriptional coactivator PGC-1\u03b1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Scassa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Handschin et al., 2005</a>). This is sometimes effective in ameliorating mild attacks. More severe cases are treated with intravenous heme, which downregulates ALAS expression through a feedback inhibition mechanism (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bonkowsky et al., 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ponka, 1997</a>). A small interfering RNA therapy targeting ALAS decreased plasma ALA and PBG levels in a mouse model of acute porphyria (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yasuda et al., 2014</a>), and entered clinical trials in 2015 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, 2016</a>, NCT02452372)."

                        "text": "Given their toxic effects in porphyrias, it is interesting to note that porphyrins accumulate under physiological circumstances in some organisms. Porphyrins or their derivatives are pigments in the wing feathers of owls (<a href=\"#bib81\">With, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Weidensaul, 2011</a>), the brilliant crimson flight feathers of turacos (<a href=\"#bib80\">With, 1957</a>), and numerous invertebrate lineages including earthworms, molluscs, and deep-sea medusae (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kennedy, 1975</a>). It has been known for close to a century that high levels of porphyrins are present in the rodent Harderian gland (<a href=\"#bib12\">Derrien and Turchini, 1924</a>), as well as in multiple tissues of the fox squirrel <i>Sciurus niger</i> (<a href=\"#bib74\">Turner, 1937</a>), though the significance of these observations remains mysterious. Porphyrins are also produced by bacteria such as <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i>, a commensal skin microbe that contributes to the pathogenesis of acne (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 1978</a>). In summary, porphyrins appear to have important, but often uncharacterized functions independent of their more well-known roles as precursors to their metal-coordinated counterparts (e.g., heme and the magnesium porphyrin chlorophyll)."

We further demonstrate that porphyrins sensitize <i>S. mediterranea</i> to intense visible light, causing pigment cell loss in animals subjected to prolonged light exposure. This response is accelerated with starvation, echoing the connection between dieting or fasting and the symptomatic attacks experienced by acute porphyria patients. In addition to serving as a popular model organism for regeneration research (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gentile et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Reddien, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Adler and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2015</a>), our observations establish planarians as an invertebrate model for in vivo studies of porphyrin photosensitization, as well as metabolic inputs into the pathophysiology of acute porphyrias."

Infrared (IR) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation were neither necessary nor sufficient to induce depigmentation under conditions we tested in follow-up experiments (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

This trait is used to age owls on the basis of the porphyrin content of their flight feathers (<a href=\"#bib78\">Weidensaul et al., 2011</a>), and to detect excreted porphyrins in the urine of porphyria patients (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balwani and Desnick, 2012</a>). We reproduced previous results showing intense red fluorescence in fixed <i>G. dorotocephala</i> at 400\u2013440 nm excitation (<a href=\"#bib43\">MacRae, 1961</a>), and found the related species <i>Dugesia japonica</i> was also highly fluorescent under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). <i>S. mediterranea</i> exhibited minimal fluorescence by comparison; however, <i>KMO-1(RNAi)</i> animals showed a dramatic increase in fluorescence relative to negative controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To confirm this was due to porphyrins, we acid extracted whole-animal homogenates (Materials and methods) and determined their absorption spectra. Like G. <i>dorotocephala</i> and <i>D. japonica</i> extracts, <i>KMO-1(RNAi)</i> extracts demonstrated bright red fluorescence under black light (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), as well as a characteristic porphyrin absorption spectrum (<a href=\"#bib22\">Huang et al., 2000</a>) with a sharp peak (the 'Soret' band) around 400 nm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Smaller peaks ('Q' bands) were evident within the visible region of the <i>G. dorotocephala</i> and D. <i>japonica</i> spectra, but could not be resolved for <i>KMO-1(RNAi)</i> extracts. Importantly, faint fluorescence and a very small, yet reproducible Soret peak were apparent for <i>S. mediterranea</i> controls. We conclude that <i>S. mediterranea</i> makes porphyrins like <i>G. dorotocephala</i>, but at substantially lower levels, or primarily in a non-fluorescent (e.g., reduced or metal-chelate) form. The effects of <i>KMO-1</i> knockdown further suggest that porphyrin biosynthesis occurs in pigment cells and may be suppressed by ommochromes (Discussion)."

Porphyrin-mediated photosensitization is observed to varying degrees in other porphyrias as well and has been clinically exploited in photodynamic therapy (PDT). This technique entails administration of one or more photosensitizing compounds followed by irradiation with a wavelength of light absorbed by the sensitizer(s). Red light is used in porphyrin-based PDT because it is transmitted by epithelial tissues but absorbed by porphyrins. The end result is production of singlet oxygen in targeted (e.g., tumor) cells, leading to cell death (<a href=\"#bib3\">Agostinis et al., 2011</a>)."

Because calf liver, the food source used in these experiments, is rich in heme, and heme exerts feedback inhibition of <i>ALAS</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bonkowsky et al., 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ponka, 1997</a>), we sought to determine whether this might account for the photoprotective effects of feeding. Egg yolk (another laboratory food source) was slightly less effective than liver in reversing starvation-induced photosensitivity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), consistent with this possibility. However, addition of exogenous heme had no impact. While our results do not exclude a role for dietary heme in regulation of porphyrin biosynthesis in planarians, they do suggest porphyrin levels are at least partly influenced by metabolic regulation of <i>ALAS</i> expression, as in acute porphyrias."

Uroporphyrinogen I is a reduced porphyrin that can undergo spontaneous oxidation to form the potent photosensitizer uroporphyrin I. Intense light exposure causes porphyrin molecules to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). This has the potential to initiate a positive feedback loop in which ROS drive further uroporphyrinogen I oxidation, leading to oxidative stress and pigment cell death.

Thus, the growing evidence for production of these pigments in brown freshwater planarians also makes them logical candidates for contributing to the bright hues seen in many terrestrial flatworms and marine polyclads (e.g., <a href=\"#bib8\">Breugelmans et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lapraz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nore\u00f1a et al., 2014</a>).

One possible explanation for these results is that ommochromes and porphyrins are jointly used as precursors in a downstream biosynthetic step to generate a single, brown body pigment, or that these molecules physically interact in a manner that quenches porphyrin fluorescence and is required for ommochrome maintenance. We are unaware of documented ommochrome-porphyrin interactions, but porphyrins can form complexes with melanins and this quenches their fluorescence in vitro (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ito et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Losi et al., 1993</a>). An alternative explanation for the effects of <i>KMO-1</i> knockdown is that ommochromes maintain porphyrins in their non-fluorescent, reduced (porphyrinogen) state. This could account for the minimal porphyrin fluorescence observed in <i>S. mediterranea</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Ommochromes are known to have antioxidant activity in other species (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ostrovsky et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Insausti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Romero and Mart\u00ednez, 2015</a>). Finally, our results are consistent with a negative feedback loop in which porphyrins induce ommochrome biosynthesis, with ommochromes in turn repressing porphyrin biosynthesis. In this regard, it is interesting to speculate that kynurenine or other tryptophan metabolites, rather than ommochromes themselves, might have signaling activities that impact porphyrin levels."

Thus, we can only speculate as to possible body pigment function(s) in planarians. One possibility is photoreception. <i>S. mediterranea</i> displays strong negative phototaxis. This is partly dependent on the melanin-producing pigment cups of the photoreceptors, yet animals lacking eye pigment retain photophobic behavior (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lambrus et al., 2015</a>), and developing embryos display light avoidance prior to eye differentiation (<a href=\"#bib67\">S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2003</a>).

UROS deficiency, the blockage in heme biosynthesis underlying CEP, is also the apparent determinant of physiological porphyrin biosynthesis in <i>S. mediterranea.</i> In the absence of this enzyme, its linear tetrapyrrole substrate hydroxymethylbilane undergoes spontaneous cyclization to form uroporphyrinogen I, a pathogenic isomer of uroporphyrinogen III that can in turn undergo spontaneous oxidation to form porphyrins.

In mice, fasting-induced <i>ALAS</i> upregulation is dependent on PGC- 1\u03b1, and inhibited by insulin signaling (<a href=\"#bib68\">Scassa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Handschin et al., 2005</a>).

The planarian model reported here complements these systems in several respects. First, off-target effects of porphyrogenic compounds can be avoided. Second, induction of photosensitization via starvation has the potential to reveal novel metabolic inputs into heme biosynthesis, as well as the toxic effects of pathway intermediates. Third, the fluorescence of fixed animals and easily inducible depigmentation response provide a convenient means of assessing porphyrin levels and their photosensitizing activity in vivo. This could prove especially useful in screening for drugs capable of reducing porphyrin biosynthesis (constitutive or induced) or alleviating porphyrin-based photosensitivity. The protective effect of DMTU against light exposure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) constitutes proof of principle for such an approach. Although porphyrias are usually manageable diseases, reliance on intravenous heme or liver transplantation to treat severe cases can result in significant complications (<a href=\"#bib70\">Seth et al., 2007</a>). There is no approved prophylactic treatment for patients who suffer recurrent attacks. We suggest planarians represent an experimentally tractable animal model in which to explore both physiological and pathological roles of porphyrins, and to seek new avenues for modulating their biosynthesis toward therapeutic benefit."

Continuous red light exposure typically resulted in full depigmentation of 1 week-starved <i>S. mediterranea</i> within 3\u20135 days (smaller animals required less time on average). Continuous white light exposure resulted in 100% lethality prior to full depigmentation with a lamp height corresponding to 5,000 lux; lower intensities were less effective in inducing depigmentation. We empirically determined that exposure periods of 24, 48, 48, and 48\u2009hr, interspersed with 24-hr recovery periods in a dark, 20\u02daC incubator (standard laboratory conditions), almost completely eliminated lethality while achieving full depigmentation. This 10-day, intermittent exposure regimen was used in all white light experiments, unless otherwise indicated. UV-blocking glass (Tru Vue) was placed between animals and the light source to guard against any possible cell damage from sustained exposure to trace amounts of near-visible UVA radiation.

The authors discovered a striking photosensitivity of planarian body pigmentation, namely that prolonged light exposure results in depigmentation in planarians. Equally remarkable is the fact that this discovery was made by undergraduates during the course of a general biology class. Following up on this observation, the authors show that this process is not simple photobleaching, but rather is caused by active elimination of pigment cells. Through the systematic analysis of ommochrome and porphyrin biosynthetic pathways, the authors identified several genes required for producing planarian pigment. RNAi knockdown of <i>KMO-1</i>, an enzyme involved in ommochrome synthesis that is expressed in pigment cells, leads to alterations in body color and increased porphyrin levels. The authors report that genes encoding heme synthetic enzymes (that generate porphyrin intermediates) are expressed in pigment cells, and the first three enzymes in the heme synthetic pathway are also required for proper pigmentation. To explore the potential role of porphyrins in light-induced depigmentation, they knock down genes involved in the heme/porphyrin biosynthesis pathway and show that knockdown of one gene, <i>PBGD-1</i>, eliminates light-induced depigmentation, and suppresses the heightened photosensitivity of <i>KMO-1(RNAi)</i> animals. The authors also report that the light-induced depigmentation is observed in starved, but not recently fed, animals. This work is carefully performed and thoughtfully presented. It lays the foundation for subsequent studies to investigate the biology of pigment cell differentiation and chemical identification of the pigments themselves (both of which I believe are beyond the scope of this study). The development of methods to remove pigmentation from planarians could have significant impacts on tool development in that field, and the connection to human porphyrias makes a compelling case for additional studies of this system. Altogether, we anticipate that the work will be of interest to the broad readership of this journal."

Our revised manuscript shows that egg yolk is slightly less effective than calf liver in reversing starvation-induced photosensitivity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), as might be expected if liver suppresses porphyrin biosynthesis merely because of its relatively high heme content. However, addition of exogenous heme to egg yolk had no discernable effect. We also show that both <i>ALAS</i> expression and porphyrin content increase with starvation (using qRT-PCR and measurements of porphyrin fluorescence in tissue homogenates \u2013 see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7C and 7D</a>, respectively), as occurs in mouse models of acute porphyrias (e.g., Handschin et al., 2005). While these new results do not exclude a role for dietary heme in regulating porphyrin biosynthesis in planarians, they do provide further support for the existence of other metabolic control mechanisms, underscoring planarians\u2019 value as an acute porphyria disease model. Further experiments (e.g., developing a defined diet) will be necessary to characterize the molecular mechanisms linking nutrient intake to <i>ALAS</i> induction, but we respectfully suggest that work is beyond the scope of the present manuscript.
