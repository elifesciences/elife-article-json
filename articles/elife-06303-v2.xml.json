Up to now, the smallest unit expressing PCP has been considered to be an entire single cell. We report that, in the larval epidermis of <i>Drosophila</i>, different subdomains of one cell can have opposite polarities. In larvae, PCP is driven by the Dachsous/Fat system; we show that the polarity of a subdomain within one cell is its response to levels of Dachsous/Fat in the membranes of contacting cells. During larval development, cells rearrange (<a href=\"#bib25\">Saavedra et al., 2014</a>) and when two subdomains of a single cell have different types of neighbouring cells, then these subdomains can become polarised in opposite directions. We conclude that polarisation depends on a local comparison of the amounts of Dachsous and Fat within opposing regions of a cell's membrane."

                        "text": "Epithelial cells are polarised within the plane of the epithelium and can display consistent orientation across extensive tracts of cells. This property, known as planar cell polarity (PCP) is revealed by polarised structures such as hairs on insect wings or in the skin of mammals. At least two genetic systems are involved in PCP and these are conserved between <i>Drosophila</i> and the mouse (<a href=\"#bib3\">Casal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lawrence et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</a>). PCP is envisaged as a cellular property, the smallest unit of manifest polarity being an entire single cell. However, we now show in <i>Drosophila</i> that different domains within a single cell can have mutually opposing polarities. These multipolar cells occur in the normal larval epidermis and are detectable because the cells are large and some are decorated with several pointed denticles. The Dachsous/Fat (Ds/Ft) system acts at intercellular contacts (<a href=\"#bib31\">Strutt and Strutt, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ma et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Casal et al., 2006</a>); we provide evidence that the polarity of a domain within one cell is its response to the levels of Ds/Ft in neighbouring cells. When another domain of that same responding cell has different neighbours, it can acquire the opposite polarity. We conclude that polarisation of a domain results from a <i>comparison</i> of the amounts of Ds and Ft in different regions of the cell membrane. This comparison is made between limited regions of membranes on opposite sides of the same cell that face each other along the anterior to posterior axis. We conjecture that \u2018conduits\u2019 span across the cell and mediate this comparison. In each region of the cell, the orientation of the conduits, a consequence of the comparison, cues the polarity of denticles."

The development of single individuals can be followed and genetic mosaics can be made and studied in vivo (<a href=\"#bib25\">Saavedra et al., 2014</a>). The epidermal cells are large (ca 30 \u00b5m across in the third stage) and show their polarity by forming, first, actin-rich predenticles near the cell membrane and then, oriented denticles in the cuticle that they secrete. There are about seven rows of denticulate cells in each segment; denticle rows 0, 1, and 4 point forwards and rows 2, 3, 5, and 6 point backwards (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). There are two rows of muscle attachments called tendon cells, T1 and T2, that lie between rows 1 and 2, and 4 and 5, respectively (<a href=\"#bib25\">Saavedra et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). As the first stage develops into the second, there are neither cell divisions nor cell deaths; nevertheless, the epidermal cells rearrange and some change their identities (<a href=\"#bib25\">Saavedra et al., 2014</a>)\u2014for example, the tendon cells form denticles in the embryo and early larva (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dilks and DiNardo, 2010</a>) but not in the second and third stages; some cells even change their polarities (<a href=\"#bib25\">Saavedra et al., 2014</a>)."

In all the figures, one individual is imaged first at mid second stage and later after moulting to third stage. Note almost exact correspondence between predenticles and denticles in all cases. Cell boundaries (Ecad) are shown in red and actin highlighted in green (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

In one of these systems, the protocadherins Ds and Ft form heterodimeric bridges between cells (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib17\">Lawrence et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Thomas and Strutt, 2012</a>). The deployment and orientation of Ds-Ft bridges within different parts of a cell membrane depend on the amounts of Ds and Ft activity in neighbouring cells. For example, a cell with a low level of Ds presents more Ft (than Ds) on its membrane and this draws more Ds (than Ft) to the abutting membrane of the neighbour; thereby affecting the distribution of dimers within the next cell. In this way, the relative numbers and orientations of heterodimers allow a comparison between a cell's anterior and posterior neighbours so that it orients its denticles towards the neighbour with the higher Ds, and/or lower Ft, activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ma et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Casal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2006</a>)."

This model derives from mutant phenotypes of the third stage larvae (<a href=\"#bib3\">Casal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Donoughe and DiNardo, 2011</a>) and experiments in which the distribution of Ds was manipulated, also at later stages (<a href=\"#bib24\">Repiso et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Donoughe and DiNardo, 2011</a>). The model also depends on the pattern of expression of <i>f</i><i>our-jointed</i> (Fj), a kinase that activates Ft and deactivates Ds (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brittle et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Simon et al., 2010</a>). <i>fj</i> is much more strongly expressed in the tendon cells than elsewhere\u2014it should lower the activity of Ds in these cells\u2014and graded in cells from rows 2 (high) to 4 (low) (Saavedra et al., in preparation).

But in reality, the arrangement of the cells is less orderly. Consider the cells of row 4. A few of these cells are tilted from the mediolateral axis; they take up \u2018atypical\u2019 positions, contributing to two different rows of cells in the normal stack (one is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, shaded magenta and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In such a cell, one portion occupies territory between a row 3 cell (in which Ds activity is medium) and a T2 cell (in which Ds activity is low).

However, the other portion of the same atypical cell intervenes between a row 3 and a normal row 4 cell and the denticles in that portion point backwards; again towards the neighbouring cell with higher Ds activity (in this case, a row 4 cell). Note that the backwards-pointing polarity adopted by this domain of the atypical cell does not, and is not expected to, affect the polarity of neighbouring cells. Its anterior neighbour, a row 3 cell, lies between a row 2 and a row 4, as does any normal row 3 cell, whereas its posterior neighbour, a row 4 cell, abuts a T2 cell that has a low Ds activity (a lower Ds activity than this portion of the atypical cell finds at its anterior interface). Therefore, under our hypothesis, cells touching this domain of the atypical row 4 cell do not differ, with respect to the Ds/Ft activities of their neighbours, from normal row 3 and 4 cells and consequently show normal polarity: thus, the row 3 cell points its denticles posteriorly, and the row 4 cell points its denticles anteriorly."

We explain below that these multipolar cells tell us that a portion of the membrane of one cell can compare itself with that in a facing portion of the same cell and this comparison polarises that particular domain of the cell. By this means a cell reads the Ds activities of its anterior and posterior neighbours and responds accordingly. In the case of the atypical row 4 cells, even though all their anterior neighbours are of the same type (row 3 cells), the neighbours at the posterior membrane are of two different types (T2 and row 4); accordingly, the two different regions of the cell manifest opposing polarities."

The situation is the same for a cell or part of a cell that inserts itself between another row 2 cell and a row 3 cell (because, according to the model of the segmental landscape of Ds activity, row 3 has a higher Ds activity than row 2 [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>; Saavedra et al., in preparation]) and they therefore make backwardly oriented denticles.

To test this hypothesis, we first looked at larvae in which the Ds/Ft system is broken. That system depends on heterodimeric bridges made up of Ds and Ft molecules; these bridges cannot form without either or both of these proteins. Using <i>ds</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup><i>ft</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> larvae, we found that atypical cells do occur both in rows 2 and 4 and are anatomically similar to those in wild type. However, the orientation of denticles in these cells is equally indeterminate in both rows and is independent of neighbours (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This is presumably and simply because, without the Ds-Ft intercellular bridges, a cell cannot compare neighbours to ascertain where to point its denticles.

These clones were initiated early in embryogenesis, around the blastoderm stage and are small, ranging in size from 1 to 5 cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Saavedra et al., 2014</a>). They probably begin to make excess Ds in the embryo following the first one or two divisions that occur in the postblastoderm epidermis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Foe and Alberts, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hartenstein and Campos-Ortega, 1985</a>) Consistent with observations on the adult of clones expressing high levels of <i>ds</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Casal et al., 2002</a>), or on larvae when groups of cells over-express <i>ds</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Repiso et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Donoughe and DiNardo, 2011</a>), neighbouring wild type cells become repolarised so that their denticles point towards cells with excess Ds. In larvae, we now find that portions of cells are affected and the orientation of denticles in that part of the cell in contact with the <i>ds</i>-expressing cell can point inwards whilst other parts of the same cell, whose neighbours are not over-expressing <i>ds</i>, point in various directions. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013H</a> illustrates a nice example, several multipolar cells are induced by the clone and one entire cell is reoriented. In this and other examples, multipolar cells also appear occasionally to affect the polarity of their neighbouring cells (see legend, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). However, such a propagation of polarity seems to be limited to those portions of neighbouring cells that contact regions of the multipolar cells that show an abnormal polarity. Again, this finding supports our conclusion that polarity is the result of a local and independent comparison between facing membranes of cell domains. Note however that this local propagation of polarity does not affect row 4 cells. We believe that this observation can be explained if the low Ds activity of the T2 cells were to strongly influence the polarity of row 4 cells, strongly enough to counteract any effect that might originate from any multipolar or repolarised row 3 neighbours. Note that the marked <i>ds</i>-expressing cells themselves show no preferred polarity, their denticles pointing in diverse directions. This might be explained by the amount of Ds activity in such cells being much higher than all their neighbours, giving insufficient directional bias to fix their own polarities."

Such gaps often affect the orientation and pattern of denticles, as well as forming some multipolar cells. Examples of these are shown (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and they find the same general explanation. Consider first a cell that is located next to a gap in the T1 tendon row and thus adjacent to a row 1 and a row 3 cell. The rows 1 and 3 have similar amounts of Ds activity and so the cell in question develops no defined polarity (magenta in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). In another case, we see the T2 row of tendon cells is interrupted and in the breach there is a denticulate cell that comes to lie between a row 4 and a row 6 cell (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>). This creates an ambiguous situation as both these neighbours have similar amounts of Ds and give no directional cue. Consequently, the cell in question has predenticles and denticles that are placed in the middle of the cell (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), giving rise to denticles that are spread over the apical surface of the cell and point in mixed directions (shown in magenta in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H</a>).

The multipolar cells provide new evidence for this hypothesis. First, note that the level of Ds in a row 3 cell should be higher than the level of Ds in a T2 cell but lower than the level of Ds in a row 4 cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Then, consider the following arguments: one that there is a comparison between the anterior and posterior membranes of the row 4 multipolar cell filled in magenta in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>. Two, that this comparison is local to different regions of that cell. Across the whole stretch of its anterior membrane this row 4 multipolar cell contacts two cells of row 3, each presenting equal amounts of Ds. However, within the posterior membrane of this same multipolar cell there are two separate regions, each abutting cells with different levels of Ds: a region abutting the T2 neighbour, and a region abutting the normal row 4 cell. The region abutting the T2 has a lower amount of Ft (as a result of the low amount of Ds in the T2 cell), and a higher amount of Ds (as a result of the high amount of Ft in the T2 cell) than the facing anterior membrane of the same cell, so its denticles point forwards.

Therefore, the comparison cannot be a signal that pervades the whole cell, and instead multipolarity suggests the existence of oriented \u2018conduits\u2019 that link facing regions within the anterior and posterior membranes of a single cell. If such oriented conduits exist they could allow the directional transport and/or unequal stabilisation of components of the polarity machinery (such as Ds and Ft themselves). Our conception of these conduits is yet incomplete; but if their orientation were determined by the distribution of Ds and Ft, and if they also helped convey Ds and Ft across the cell, then together both these properties could constitute a feedback mechanism. Such a mechanism would make the polarity of cells more robust and also would affect the propagation of polarity from cell to cell. Understanding propagation is important because experiments suggest that the distribution of Ds and Ft within the membrane of one cell is partly determined by the distribution of these molecules in that cell's neighbours and also in cells beyond (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib32\">Thomas and Strutt, 2012</a>)."

All membranes contain both kinds of dimers: these are Ds in the cell <i>x</i> (Ds<sup>x</sup>), linked to Ft in the neighbouring cell <i>y</i> (Ft<sup>y</sup>), or Ft in the cell <i>x</i> (Ft<sup>x</sup>) linked to Ds in the neighbouring cell <i>y</i> (Ds<sup>y</sup>). We proposed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Casal et al., 2006</a>) that intercellular bridges consisting of heterodimers of Ds and Ft are asymmetrically distributed in a polarised cell and determine the polarity of that cell. In the diagram, we indicate a majority of Ds by yellow, and a majority of Ft by rufous. Some membranes contain similar numbers of Ds and Ft and these are shown with alternating blotches of the two colours. Arrows indicate the sign and the paths of the oriented conduits that span between facing and limited areas of membrane. Such conduits can give small parts of cells an individual polarity, as in the atypical cell in row 4 (red arrows). The tendon cells, T1 and T2, largely drive the segmental pattern of Ds activity\u2014they have low Ds activity and therefore the majority of heterodimers formed between a T2 and a row 4 cell are Ds<sup>4</sup>\u2013Ft<sup>T2</sup>. Similarly at the boundary between a row 2 and a row 3 cell, the majority of the heterodimers are Ft<sup>2</sup>\u2013Ds<sup>3</sup>; partly because at the opposite boundary between a T1 and a row 2 cell, the heterodimers are largely Ft<sup>T1</sup>\u2013Ds<sup>2</sup>. Where row 3 and row 4 cells meet in the wild type, they are imagined to have similar levels of Ds<sup>3</sup>\u2013Ft<sup>4</sup> and Ft<sup>3</sup>\u2013Ds<sup>4</sup> because, at that cell junction similar, but opposite, effects from very low Ds levels in both T1 and T2 tendon cells converge. However, in the red-arrowed region, at the anterior limit of the atypical cell, the heterodimers are mostly Ft<sup>3</sup>\u2013Ds<sup>4</sup>. We propose that in this red-arrowed region, the deployment of heterodimers is the outcome of a different comparison made between facing subregions of the anterior and posterior limits of this atypical cell. What is different about this comparison? In this red-arrowed region, the cell's anterior neighbours (row 3) have less Ds than the posterior neighbour (a normal row 4). As a result, at the boundary between row 3 and atypical row 4, the heterodimers will be mostly Ft<sup>3</sup>\u2013Ds<sup>4</sup>. However, at the facing boundary, between atypical and normal row 4, there are balancing influences from anterior and posterior directions, as in a boundary between a normal row 3 and a normal row 4, and as a consequence the amounts of Ds<sup>4</sup>\u2013Ft<sup>4</sup> and Ft<sup>4</sup>\u2013Ds<sup>4</sup> heterodimers should be similar."

In a particular part of the wing, and for a relatively short time, these authors noted that there are microtubules that are oriented proximodistally. In this part of the wing, they showed a slight preponderance (ca 5%) of oriented microtubules with the minus ends proximal and their plus ends distal and proposed that Ds and Ft are instrumental in this net orientation. Changing the distribution of Ds in a test part of the wing changed the net orientation of the microtubules (<a href=\"#bib15\">Harumoto et al., 2010</a>). Our hypothesis of conduits could relate to these findings; microtubules could form all, part or none of these conduits. But, if they do it is not clear why, in most parts of the wing and for most of the time, the microtubules and the hairs are not co-oriented. In any case, a net orientation of microtubules might be read out as a net transport of vesicles from proximal to distal (<a href=\"#bib27\">Shimada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Harumoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gault et al., 2012</a>). A similar process in the larval epidermal cells could lead to the subsequent orientation of predenticles in the membrane, but how they would do this is unknown. Microtubules have been observed in cells of the embryonic epidermis at the time that the denticles of the first larval stage are formed, although their actual polarity is not known (<a href=\"#bib23\">Price et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Marcinkevicius and Zallen, 2013</a>)."

It is not clear if this kind of multipolarity relates to PCP: a defining feature of PCP is that the orientation of a cell is fixed by cell interaction and this is not usually the case with isolated motile cells. However, in plants, pavement cells are genuinely multipolar. They show that even between two identical neighbours, local interactions can be of different sign and can organise the cytoskeleton in different ways to build cells that, at least near the periphery, have regions of opposing polarities (<a href=\"#bib35\">Xu et al., 2010</a>)."

Multipolarity in the larval cells of <i>Drosophila</i> that we report makes it clear that PCP is, or can be, subcellular; consequently, some current models of PCP may need to be adapted. For instance, our observations raise the possibility that all cells are fundamentally \u2018multipolar\u2019 but, usually, all subregions of a cell are subject to consistent polarising influences and are co-oriented."

In addition, in late stages (L3), there are two rows of tendon cells that lack denticles and serve as borders of Ds activity (as they apparently express high levels of Fj repressing Ds activity based on a paper under preparation and not available to the reviewer). Here, Rovira et al. propose a model that each cell compares Ds activity levels of its anterior and posterior neighbours and grows the denticle towards the neighbour with higher Ds activity. To test, they make use of the fact that the larval epithelium is not a perfect wall of bricks, but that some of the very large cells contact 2 cells of different rows on one of their sides (with anticipated distinct activities of Ds)."

The figure legend states that \u201cthis deployment of heterodimers is the result of a local comparison made between facing subregions of the anterior and posterior limits of this atypical cell\u201d. There is some (apparent?) circularity between cause and effect here. Our understanding is that the local comparison is between Ft and Ds distribution in the facing subregions, not that the comparison determines the distribution of Ft and Ds. Do clarify this in the revised manuscript."
