Recent studies have revealed significant downregulation of TFIID subunits in terminally differentiated myocytes, hepatocytes and adipocytes. Here, we report that TBP protein levels are tightly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay coupled with biochemical fractionation, we identified Huwe1 as an E3 ligase targeting TBP for K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Upregulation of Huwe1 expression during myogenesis induces TBP degradation and myotube differentiation. We found that Huwe1 activity on TBP is antagonized by the deubiquitinase USP10, which protects TBP from degradation. Thus, modulating the levels of both Huwe1 and USP10 appears to fine-tune the requisite degradation of TBP during myogenesis. Together, our study unmasks a previously unknown interplay between an E3 ligase and a deubiquitinating enzyme regulating TBP levels during cellular differentiation."

We found that Huwe1 activity on TBP is antagonized by the deubiquitinase USP10, which protects TBP from degradation. Thus, modulating the levels of both Huwe1 and USP10 appears to fine-tune the requisite degradation of TBP during myogenesis. Together, our study unmasks a previously unknown interplay between an E3 ligase and a deubiquitinating enzyme regulating TBP levels during cellular differentiation."

TBP serves as a key subunit to facilitate transcription initiation by all three RNA polymerases in eukaryotic cells. As a part of the SL1 complex, TBP plays a role in recognizing Pol I-transcribed promoters (<a href=\"#bib5\">Comai et al., 1994</a>). Similarly, TBP and its associated factors (TAFs) that make up the TFIID complex are specific for Pol II-mediated mRNA transcription (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dynlacht et al., 1991</a>). Likewise, the TBP/B/BRF complex TFIIIB drives the transcription of small nuclear RNAs by Pol III (<a href=\"#bib30\">Taggart et al., 1992</a>). Given this pivotal role in transcription, TBP-mediated transcriptional regulation has been extensively studied by biochemical and genetic approaches in past decades(<a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez, 1993</a>). However, only limited studies have interrogated the regulation of TBP during cell-type specification. The main reason is that cell-type specific transcription programs have generally been considered to be dictated by classic sequence-specific transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib12\">Farnham, 2009</a>), while the components of the core promoter recognition machinery such as TBP were thought to be largely invariant across different cell types (<a href=\"#bib31\">Thomas and Chiang, 2006</a>)."

Specifically, in terminally differentiated myocytes, hepatocytes and adipocytes, normally high concentrations of TBP protein as well as the canonical components of the TFIID complex become severely reduced while other core pre-initiation complex components such as RNA Pol II remain largely unaffected (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">D'Alessio et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). In conjunction with TBP downregulation, various cell-type specific \u2018orphan\u2019 TAFs are switched on to help direct developmental gene expression and terminal differentiation program (<a href=\"#bib7\">D'Alessio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</a>). Interestingly, it was found that reductions in TBP protein levels are much more pronounced than decreases in its mRNA levels, suggesting that an important level of TBP regulation occurs post-transcriptionally (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">D'Alessio et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Herrera et al., 2014</a>). We therefore set out to decipher the mechanisms by which TBP protein levels are regulated during differentiation."

By using a combination of in vitro assays and biochemical fractionation, we identified the 480 kDa Huwe1 protein as a major E3 ligase targeting TBP. We confirmed in vitro that purified recombinant Huwe1 targets TBP for ubiquitination, while loss-of-function experiments allowed us to probe TBP regulation by the E3 ligase in vivo. We also identified USP10 as a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) that modulates Huwe1-mediated TBP ubiquitination and protects TBP from proteasome-mediated degradation. Importantly, we were able to show that the E3 ligase becomes significantly upregulated during myotube differentiation, while its paired USP becomes dramatically downregulated. Together, our results support a model in which coordinated ubiquitination and deubiquitination activities finely balance TBP protein levels during terminal differentiation."

Since the major protein degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells is mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hochstrasser, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</a>), we treated post-mitotic myotubes with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and checked whether TBP downregulation was affected. Strikingly, TBP protein levels were partially restored within 4 hr after MG132 treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), suggesting that the UPS likely plays a dominant role in regulating TBP levels during terminal differentiation."

As expected, the TBP ubiquitination activity of the purified recombinant Huwe1 protein was much more robust than that of partially purified fractions, presumably due to higher Huwe1 concentrations and/or the absence of potential inhibitors of ubiquitin polymerization. When using a methyl ubiquitin that only supports monoubiquitination together with purified recombinant Huwe1 in our assay (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hershko and Heller, 1985</a>), we detected a ladder of shifted bands separated by around 8 kDa similar to the TBP ubiquitination patterns generated by the partially purified Mono Q fractions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Since these shifted bands likely correspond to different ubiquitination sites, the use of methyl ubiquitin also allowed us to estimate the number of distinct ubiquitination sites on TBP to be more than 10 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

To confirm that the HECT domain of Huwe1 is required for its TBP ubiquitination activity, we generated two mutants of Huwe1: one with the HECT domain truncated (\u03944341\u20134374), the other with the active site cysteine residue mutated to serine. Both mutant proteins were purified through the same procedures as the wild type protein (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Neither of the mutants was able to mediate TBP ubiquitination in vitro (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

To map the topology, we performed in vitro TBP ubiquitination assays using ubiquitin mutants with individual lysines mutated to arginines. Strikingly, when K48R ubiquitin was used, poly-ubiquitinated TBP species were significantly diminished (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, lane 4), suggesting that Huwe1 likely mediates K48-linked ubiquitin chain formation on TBP.

Knocking-down Huwe1 in 293T cells with two different shRNAs resulted in increased levels of endogenous TBP protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To determine relative TBP protein stability more quantitatively in cells, we developed an in vivo TBP half-life measurement system based on a fluorescence timer assay (<a href=\"#bib21\">Khmelinskii et al., 2012</a>). In this assay, TBP is fused to both a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mCherry), which takes hours to complete its maturation, and a monomeric superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), which becomes fluorescent within minutes after synthesis. Due to the slow maturation rate of mCherry relative to sfGFP, the mCherry/sfGFP intensity ratio at steady state correlates with the half-life of the fusion protein, independent of the protein synthesis rate (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We co-transfected 293T cells with plasmids expressing Huwe1 shRNAs and TBP-mCherry-sfGFP fusion protein. Knockdown of Huwe1 by 2 independent shRNAs led to significant increases in mCherry/GFP intensity ratios, evident in both imaging and flow cytometry analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similarly, lentivirus-mediated Huwe1 shRNA knockdown in C2C12 myoblasts leads to elevated endogenous TBP protein levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We further tested how Huwe1 affects TBP protein half-life by cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments. Consistent with results from fluorescent timer experiments, Huwe1 knockdown by two independent shRNAs both increased TBP protein half-life in myoblasts (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that Huwe1 modulates TBP protein levels in living cells."

One possibility is that Huwe1 E3 ligase activities are upregulated during muscle differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we examined Huwe1 protein levels in myoblasts and myotubes. Strikingly, in contrast to dramatic decreases in TBP protein levels, Huwe1 protein levels are significantly upregulated in myotubes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This observation is consistent with previously published results showing that Huwe1 transcripts are enriched in muscle tissues (<a href=\"#bib29\">Schwarz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Chen et al., 2005</a>). To confirm that Huwe1 is indeed responsible for active TBP degradation in myotubes, we treated myotubes with high titer viruses expressing shRNAs against Huwe1 on differentiation Day 4. This treatment resulted in abnormal morphologies of the polynucleated myotubes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), accompanied by increased TBP protein levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These results support a model wherein the upregulation of Huwe1 protein levels during myogenesis likely leads to enhanced TBP ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of TBP protein."

When cultured in proliferation medium, the Huwe1 knockdown cells are morphologically similar to control cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Consistent with this observation, genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed no significant gene expression changes for cell-cycle and house-keeping genes upon Huwe1 knockdown in C2C12 cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 3</a>). However, it is worth noting that two important myogenic regulator genes, <i>Myod1</i> and <i>Mef2c</i>, showed a \u223ctwofold decrease in expression levels in Huwe1 knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We next performed myogenic differentiation experiments to evaluate the lineage commitment potential of Huwe1 depleted myoblasts. Interestingly, Huwe1 knockdown cells failed to differentiate into polynucleated myotubes efficiently even after 6 days of differentiation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Consistent with this phenotypic observation, the induction of several master myogenic regulators (<i>Myod1</i>, <i>Myog</i> and <i>Mef2c</i>) was inhibited in the Huwe1 knockdown cells during differentiation (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To gain more information about potential changes in transcription between control and Huwe1 knockdown cell populations, we compared gene expression profiles of these two cell types by RNA-seq analysis. Differential gene expression followed by gene ontology analysis revealed that many genes critical for muscle development have lower expression levels in Huwe1 knockdown cells (<i>e.g., Myod1</i>, <i>Myog</i>, <i>Mef2a</i>, <i>Mef2c</i>, <i>Ckm</i> and <i>Myh3</i>) on differentiation Day 6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>), suggesting the functional importance of Huwe1 during in vitro muscle differentiation. We further tested this notion by directly knocking down Huwe1 in differentiated myotubes. Loss of Huwe1 induced abnormal morphological changes of myotubes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Consistent with these morphological changes, differential gene expression followed by gene ontology analysis revealed that many genes (<i>e.g., Myog</i>, <i>Mef2a</i>, <i>Mef2c, Ckm</i> and <i>Myh3</i>) important for muscle development are downregulated in Huwe1 depleted myotubes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 2</a>)."

                                "text": "In C2C12 myoblasts, TBP protein is present at substantial levels despite the presence of Huwe1 E3 ligase. We therefore reasoned that there must be activities in these cells that may be antagonizing the ubiquitination of TBP by Huwe1 and thereby protect it from degradation. Interestingly, a previous study reported that in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Ubp3 deubiquitinates Tbp1 both in vivo and in vitro and prevents Tbp1 from proteasome-mediated degradation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chew et al., 2010</a>). A protein sequence homology comparison suggests that ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) is the likely mammalian homolog of Ubp3 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cohen et al., 2003</a>). To test whether USP10 deubiquitinates and stabilizes TBP in mammalian cells, we overexpressed USP10 in 293T cells and monitored TBP ubiquitination levels in these cells. Strikingly, overexpression of USP10 significantly inhibited TBP ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). To test whether USP10 deubiquitinates TBP through direct protein\u2013protein interactions, we used HA-TBP to co-IP with Flag-USP10 co-expressed in 293T cells. Our experiment revealed that TBP can co-immunoprecipitate with USP10 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Importantly, both western blot and flow cytometry analysis confirmed modestly increased TBP protein levels in a C2C12 stable cell line overexpressing USP10 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, cycloheximide chase experiments (CHX) revealed that USP10 overexpression increased TBP protein half-life in C2C12 myoblasts(<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) . These results suggest that USP10-mediated TBP deubiquitination might also contribute to regulating TBP levels during myogenesis. To further test this possibility, we compared the protein levels of USP10 before and after myotube differentiation. Interestingly, similar to TBP, the protein levels of USP10 decrease during in vitro muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). We then examined whether increasing USP10 protein levels in post mitotic myotubes can rescue TBP protein levels. To do this, we generated a stable cell line with an inducible USP10 transgene. Upon addition of the inducer (cumate), USP10 can be induced to higher levels in both myoblasts and myotubes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). USP10 overexpression in myotubes resulted in higher levels of TBP protein (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). To probe whether UPS10 downregulation during myogenesis is of functional significance, we evaluated the differentiation potential of the C2C12 cell line overexpressing USP10. These cells failed to differentiate into polynucleated myotubes in differentiation medium (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Consistent with this observation, transcriptome analysis revealed that several important myogenic markers (e.g., <i>Myod1</i>, <i>Myog</i>, <i>Myh3</i> and <i>Ckm</i>) failed to be induced in cells overexpressing USP10 even on differentiation Day 6 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Taken together, our results suggest that a combination of Huwe1 upregulation and USP10 downregulation may be important for modulating TBP degradation during myogenesis."

However, recent studies have shown that the protein levels of TBP as well as other canonical components of the TFIID complex can become significantly down-regulated in terminally differentiated myocytes, hepatocytes and adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">D'Alessio et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Herrera et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, decreases in TBP protein levels are much more pronounced than changes in its mRNA levels. However, the mechanism for regulating cellular TBP protein levels remained largely unknown. Here, we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a dominant role in mediating TBP protein levels in terminally differentiated myotubes. Interestingly, we found that an E3 ligase activity responsible for ubiquitinating TBP is also present in proliferating cell types such as myoblasts and Hela cells, where TBP is highly expressed. These results suggest that cellular TBP protein levels are under active surveillance by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that TBP protein levels may be tightly regulated in a cell-type specific manner."

In addition to TBP, Huwe1 has also been suggested to target several other proteins involved in cell-cycle check point and apoptosis, including p53, MCL-1, N-MYC, C-MYC and CDC6. Interestingly, although Huwe1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, it is particularly enriched in skeletal muscle, which is the tissue where a dramatic decrease in TBP protein levels during terminal differentiation was first reported (<a href=\"#bib29\">Schwarz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>).

The exact role of USP10 during development remains unclear due to the absence of mouse models. However, we found that a stable cell line (C2C12) overexpressing USP10 is impaired in myotube formation, suggesting that down-regulation of USP10 may also be a prerequisite for efficient differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes in culture. Deubiquitinases achieve their target specificities through either direct recognition of their substrates or targeting specific ubiquitin chain topologies. Our immune-precipitation experiments suggest that USP10 can recognize ubiquitinated TBP through direct protein\u2013protein interactions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

However, given the seminal role of TFIID/TBP in promoting the transcription of cell cycle and DNA replication genes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Um et al., 2001</a>), it is reasonable to speculate that down-regulation of TBP should at least influence cell cycle exit of myoblasts, a key step during myotube differentiation. In the future, it may be interesting to study the functional role of Huwe1 and UPS10 during muscle development in vivo and how these two enzymes may regulate TBP protein levels in mouse models. Since TBP protein levels also become dramatically reduced in terminally differentiated hepatocytes and adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib6\">D'Alessio et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>), it will also be interesting to test whether Huwe1 and UPS10 contribute to TBP downregulation in these other cell types. It also remains unclear whether there are other E3s that would work together with Huwe1 to facilitate TBP protein degradation in terminally differentiated muscle cells. In addition to TBP, other components of the TFIID complex also become down-regulated during terminal differentiation, and in the future it will be worth investigating whether they are targeted by the same or different E3/deubiquitinase pairs."

                                "text": "In several previous studies, we observed that in addition to the loss or depletion of TBP during terminal differentiation of cell-types including myotubes and adipocytes, one of the so-called \u2018orphan TAFs\u2019 such as TAF3 and TAF7l, respectively, becomes up-regulated or remains highly expressed while the other prototypic TFIID subunits become down-regulated (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Yao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). In the case of myoblast to myotube formation, we also detected the presence of a TBP related factor, TRF3, that appeared to play some role in possibly either substituting for TBP, as seen by in vitro reactions, or otherwise remaining detectable during terminal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deato and Tjian, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Deato et al., 2008</a>). This led us, initially, to propose that the loss of TBP might be accompanied by the assembly of different initiation complexes lacking TBP but containing TRFs and orphan TAFs. However, in several subsequent studies including ESC's, adipocytes and motor neurons, although we consistently observed the emergence and up-regulation of orphan TAFs (i.e. TAF3, TAF7l and TAF9b), we did not detect any up-regulation of TRFs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Herrera et al., 2014</a>). Instead, in each of these cases, ChIP-seq experiments suggested that these orphan TAFs were associated both with core promoters (i.e. TSS) as well as either distal or proximal enhancers of target genes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Herrera et al., 2014</a>). It was also reported that KO mice lacking TRF3 showed no obvious muscle development phenotypes casting doubt on the importance of TRF3 in muscle development in vivo (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gazdag et al., 2009</a>). It is therefore possible that both the loss of TBP and TFIID components in certain cell-types is not necessarily accompanied by a change in the core promoter recognition complex as initially postulated (i.e. substituting various TBP/TAFs/TRFs) but a more elaborate and as yet unclear mechanism may come into play potentially involving new interactions between certain TAFs and cell-type specific transcription factors bound to enhancers. In any case, in all our studies of terminal differentiating cell types, we observed a significant, sometimes dramatic loss of TBP and TFIID components that is often accompanied by persistent or differential up-regulation of an orphan TAF."

                                "text": "An interesting possibility is that down-regulation of TBP protein levels could differentially affect genes with distinct TBP-promoter binding affinities. Recent single molecule studies suggest that transcription factor temporal occupancies at high affinity sites are less sensitive to changes in concentration than those at low-affinity sites (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it is possible that, by fine-tuning TBP protein levels, genes with weak TBP/TFIID binding promoters become selectively turned down while genes with strong TBP/TFIID binding promoters remain largely unaffected thereby executing another mechanism for differential gene regulation."

RNA-seq library was prepared using ScriptSeq v2 RNA-seq Library Preparation Kit (SSV21106, illumina, San Diego, CA), and then sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing platform. Reads were mapped to the genome using Tophat, and differentiation expression analysis was done using Cuffdiff (<a href=\"#bib32\">Trapnell et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2012</a>). Results were plotted out using R package Plotrix, and gene ontology analysis was done using R package Goseq (<a href=\"#bib37\">Young et al., 2010</a>)."

They also identified UbC5Hb/c as the E2s involved in Hewe1-mediated ubiquitylation. Interestingly, based on homology from yeast they identified USP10 as the iso-peptidase for TBP, and suggested that USP10 disassemble poly-ubiquitylated-TBP preventing the degradation of TBP. Thus, supporting but not directly testing the idea that a balance between the expression of Hewe1 and USP10 determines the level of TBP. Furthermore, loss of Huwe1 or to a lesser extent expression of USP10 resulted in a failure of C2C12 differentiation, and inability to express muscle specific genes as evident by RNA-seq and GO analysis."

Based on this result, it will be quite challenging to address whether TBP mutants that fail to bind Huwe1 are not degraded during differentiation. Previous crystallographic studies have shown that the conserved C-terminal DNA binding domain is a highly structured region of TBP (Nikolov et al., 1996). TBP mutants with truncated C-termini are most likely misfolded and will be degraded by Huwe1-independent pathways (Goldberg, 2003). Indeed, previous studies in yeast have shown that even point mutants in the TBP DNA binding domain can alter its protein stability (Jackson-Fisher et al., 1999; Kou et al., 2003).
