                    "text": "Bacterial phototaxis was first recognized over a century ago, but the method by                     which such small cells can sense the direction of illumination has remained                     puzzling. The unicellular cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC                     6803 moves with Type IV pili and measures light intensity and color with a range                     of photoreceptors. Here, we show that individual <i>Synechocystis</i>                     cells do not respond to a spatiotemporal gradient in light intensity, but rather                     they directly and accurately sense the position of a light source. We show that                     directional light sensing is possible because <i>Synechocystis</i>                     cells act as spherical microlenses, allowing the cell to see a light source and                     move towards it. A high-resolution image of the light source is focused on the                     edge of the cell opposite to the source, triggering movement away from the                     focused spot. Spherical cyanobacteria are probably the world\u2019s smallest                     and oldest example of a camera eye."

                    "text": "Bacterial phototaxis was first recognized over a century ago, but the method by                     which such small cells can sense the direction of illumination has remained                     puzzling. The unicellular cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC                     6803 moves with Type IV pili and measures light intensity and color with a range                     of photoreceptors. Here, we show that individual <i>Synechocystis</i>                     cells do not respond to a spatiotemporal gradient in light intensity, but rather                     they directly and accurately sense the position of a light source. We show that                     directional light sensing is possible because <i>Synechocystis</i>                     cells act as spherical microlenses, allowing the cell to see a light source and                     move towards it. A high-resolution image of the light source is focused on the                     edge of the cell opposite to the source, triggering movement away from the                     focused spot. Spherical cyanobacteria are probably the world\u2019s smallest                     and oldest example of a camera eye."

Cyanobacteria in the oceans are among the world\u2019s most important oxygen                     producers and carbon dioxide consumers. <i>Synechocystis</i> is a                     spherical single-celled cyanobacterium that measures about three thousandths of                     a millimetre across.

Unlike some bacteria, <i>Synechocystis</i>                     can\u2019t swim, but it can crawl across surfaces.

When a                     light is shone at the cell, an image of the light source is focused at the                     opposite edge of the cell. Light-detecting molecules called photoreceptors                     respond to the focused image of the light source, and this provides the                     information needed to steer the cell towards the light.

However, it is generally assumed that bacteria are too small for direct sensing of a                 concentration gradient across the cell: instead they probe changes in stimulus                 concentration over time, as in the classic paradigm of flagella-mediated chemotaxis                 in <i>Escherichia coli</i> (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib50\">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</a>). When moving through a spatial concentration                 gradient of an attractant, <i>E. coli</i> cells experience temporal                 concentration changes, which they sense by employing a biochemical memory that                 directs a \u201cbiased random walk\u201d. Swimming along a straight path (run)                 alternates with random changes of direction (tumble). Tumbles become less frequent                 when cells sense a temporal increase in attractant concentration, introducing a bias                 to movement up a concentration gradient (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berg and                     Brown, 1972</a>)."

Unsurprisingly, many phototrophs can                 alter their movement in response to the light environment (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib22\">H\u00e4der, 1987</a>). Bacterial phototaxis was                 first noted in 1883 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Engelmann, 1883</a>) and                 has been characterized in free-swimming phototrophs including purple bacteria and                     <i>Halobacterium</i> spp. (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hildebrand and Dencher, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alam and                     Oesterhelt, 1984</a>). Cyanobacteria, which are oxygenic phototrophs, do not                 swim with flagella. Instead, various species exhibit \u201ctwitching\u201d or                 \u201cgliding\u201d motility over moist surfaces (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pringsheim, 1968</a>). This movement can be directed towards a                 light source, thus constituting true phototaxis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bhaya, 2004</a>;                     <a href=\"#bib56\">Yoshihara and Ikeuchi, 2004</a>)."

PCC 6803                 (hereafter <i>Synechocystis</i>) has spherical cells about 3 \u00b5m in                 diameter and moves using Type IV pili (T4P) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bhaya                     et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yoshihara et al.,                     2001</a>). The location of the T4P extension motor PilB1 implies that pili                 are extended at the leading edge of the cell, and therefore that movement is                 generated by pilus retraction (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schuergers et al.,                     2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wilde and Mullineaux,                 2015</a>), as has been shown in other bacteria (<a href=\"#bib31\">Merz et al., 2000</a>). It has recently been established that the motility                 of a filamentous cyanobacterium is also T4P-dependent, suggesting that this form of                 motility is widespread in cyanobacteria (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khayatan                     et al., 2015</a>). One likely exception is marine <i>Synechococcus                     spp.,</i> which swims and exhibits chemotaxis without obvious surface                 appendages (<a href=\"#bib52\">Willey and Waterbury, 1989</a>;                     <a href=\"#bib12\">Ehlers and Oster, 2012</a>) apart from                 short spicules found in one of the motile <i>Synechococcus</i> strains                     (<a href=\"#bib39\">Samuel et al., 2001</a>)."

Genetic studies have identified a number of                 photoreceptors that influence phototactic behavior under different light regimes                     (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhaya, 2004</a>).

Here, we establish that individual <i>Synechocystis</i>                 cells can directly and accurately perceive the position of a unidirectional light                 source, and control their motility so as to move towards it. We then show that                     <i>Synechocystis</i> cells act as microlenses, and that the light                 intensity gradient across the cell due to this lensing effect is far greater than                 the effects of shading due to light absorption or reflection. Finally, we use                 highly-localized laser excitation to show that specific excitation of one side of                 the cell triggers movement away from the light, indicating that positive phototaxis                 results from movement away from an image of the light source focused on the opposite                 side of the cell. Essentially, the cell acts as a microscopic eyeball."

First, we tested the response of                     cells to a light intensity gradient projected onto the surface from the                     microscope condenser (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), using a                     gradient of white light from 0\u201320 \u00b5mol photons                         m<sup>\u20132</sup> s<sup>\u20131</sup>, an intensity range that is                     relevant for positive phototaxis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choi et al.,                         1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bhaya, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chau et al., 2015</a>). However, the cells                     moved randomly without any significant directional bias (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video                         1</a>). If <i>Synechocystis</i> phototaxis were based on a                     biochemical memory like <i>E. coli</i> chemotaxis, cells would                     perceive temporal changes in light intensity as they move across the surface                     through the light gradient and would then accumulate in regions of optimal light                     intensity. This did not occur (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>,                         <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). By contrast, when cells                     were illuminated by a unidirectional light source (RGB illumination at 10                     \u00b5mol photons m<sup>\u20132</sup> s<sup>\u20131</sup>) at an angle                     oblique to the surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), the                     majority of motile cells switched direction within about 1 min, and then moved                     directly towards the light source (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure                         1c,d,f</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Under                     illumination from two equal-intensity orthogonal light sources, the majority of                     cells moved towards a point midway between the two light sources (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These behaviors are not consistent with a                     run-and-tumble mechanism or any kind of biased random walk. In accord with                     previous studies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choi et al., 1999</a>;                         <a href=\"#bib9\">Chau et al., 2015</a>), we conclude that                     individual cells can directly and accurately perceive the position of a light                     source and control their motility accordingly."

To assess the plausibility of this                     idea, we estimated the transmission spectrum of a single motile cell, scaling                     the absorption spectrum for a cell suspension according to the mean cellular                     pigment content. To ensure that pigment content was appropriate for phototactic                     cells, we used cells taken from moving colonies on motility plates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The transmission spectrum shows                     that even at peak absorption wavelengths, a single cell can absorb only about                     20% of the photons that pass through it (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure                         2</a>). Although local pigment concentrations within the cell are quite                     high (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), the very short optical                     path\u00a0length means that light\u00a0absorption by the cell is low. Note                     that our estimate assumes a homogeneous distribution of pigments within the                     thylakoid region of the cell: in reality, pigment clustering will tend to                     decrease the cell absorbance due to enhanced self-shading of pigments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duysens, 1956</a>). Thus, 20% represents a                     maximum estimate of the proportion of photons that can be absorbed, and the                     light intensity gradient across the cell due to shading must be almost                     negligible. The direct measurement of single\u00a0cell absorption spectra is                     technically challenging, and we are aware of only one such measurement in the                     literature for a cyanobacterium. <a href=\"#bib47\">Sugiura and                         Itoh (2012)</a> show that the peak absorbance for a single cell of                         <i>Nostoc</i> sp. is about 0.04. This corresponds to a peak                     absorption of about 10% of the photons that pass through the cell, which is even                     lower than our estimate for <i>Synechocystis</i>."

Therefore,                     to quantify the lensing effect, we first employed a                         <i>Synechocystis</i> mutant that accumulates green fluorescent                     protein (GFP) evenly distributed in the periplasm (<a href=\"#bib45\">Spence et al., 2003</a>). Thus, GFP can be used as local                     reporter of light intensity at the cell periphery (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>) since GFP fluorescence will be proportional to                     the local excitation light intensity.

Profiles of GFP fluorescence around the cell perimeter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>) indicate that the mean ratio of                     the light intensity at the center of this focused spot to the intensity at the                     front of the cell facing the light source was 4.1 \u00b1 1.5 (mean and                     standard\u00a0deviation, <i>n</i> = 13 cells from one representative                     experiment) and the observed mean full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the                     focused spot was 609 \u00b1 30 nm (mean and standard\u00a0deviation,                         <i>n</i> = 11 cells). Since the measured FWHM for the point-spread                     function of the microscope was 270 nm, the true FWHM for the focused spot of 488                     nm light at the cell periphery can be estimated to be about 550 nm. This                     experiment shows that for 488 nm light, lensing effects leading to concentration                     of light at the opposite side of the cell from the light source are                     overwhelmingly greater than shading effects, which would lead to higher light                     intensity on the illuminated side of the cell. Shading effects at other                     wavelengths in the range from 400\u00a0to\u00a0750 nm could be only                     marginally greater than at 488 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure                         2</a>)."

Therefore, for higher-resolution measurement of near-field                     light perturbation by <i>Synechocystis</i> cells, we used a                     photolithographic method that gives a very high resolution image of the light                     pattern adjacent to the cell, although it does not provide such a direct and                     quantitative measurement of relative light intensity as the fluorescence imaging                     in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>.                         <i>Synechocystis</i> cells were adsorbed onto the surface of a                     photopolymer and collimated UV light (365 nm) was projected vertically down onto                     them (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). The UV light induces                     cross-linking of the photopolymer. After development, the surface relief of the                     photopolymer gives a high-resolution replica of the light\u00a0field around                     and beneath each cell, which we examined by atomic\u00a0force microscopy                         (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).                         <i>Synechocystis</i> cells produced distinctive near-field optical                     scattering patterns on the polymer surface with a remarkably sharp and intense                     peak beneath the center of each cell. We measured an FWHM of 281 \u00b1 33 nm                     (mean and standard\u00a0deviation, <i>n =</i> 6 from profiles at                     different angles across the representative image shown) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). This experiment indicates that near-UV light                     is focused to a spot with diameter less than the wavelength. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a> also confirms that near-UV light                     is concentrated at the side of the cell opposite to the light source in a                     similar manner to light in the visible range. As with visible light (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a>), the lensing effect                     predominates over any shading effects with near-UV light (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>)."

This                     electromagnetic description traces all observed effects back to the interference                     of incoming waves with waves scattered by their encounter with the object, which                     in this case was a simplified model of the cell as a microsphere with uniform                     refractive index. The method predicts a combination of effects that, on larger                     scales, are described as interference, refraction and internal reflection. We                     found that the observed near-field light pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>) could be accurately reproduced by an FDTD                     simulation approximating the cell as a dielectric sphere with a diameter of 3                     \u00b5m and a refractive index of 1.4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure                         3f</a>).

This suggests that the basis for directional light perception by                         <i>Synechocystis</i> should depend on the lensing properties of                     the cells, with positive phototaxis based on the cell moving away from the light                     spot focused at its periphery. We tested this idea by using a                     highly\u00a0focused laser light spot (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lowe                         et al., 2015</a>) as an alternative way to selectively illuminate one                     edge of the cell. <i>Synechocystis</i> cells moving directionally on                     an agarose surface towards a red (625 nm) light emitting diode (LED) light                     source were visualized by fluorescence from the photosynthetic pigments excited                     by the LED light. Focused spots of light at the rear periphery of the cell were                     again observed under this illumination regime (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>),                     showing that the focused light spots extend into the thylakoid membrane region.                     The moving cells were allowed to encounter a spot of 640 nm laser light focused                     on the agarose surface (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The intensity gradient at the                     edge of the laser spot was steep enough to ensure specific exposure of one side                     of the cell to the light (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>).                     Whenever one edge of a cell encountered the edge of the laser spot, the cell                     changed direction to move away from the laser illumination (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video                         2</a>). Cells did not cross the center of the intense laser spot, but                     instead changed direction when the laser light intensity at the front edge of                     the cell exceeded the intensity of the light spot focused by the cell at its                     rear periphery by a factor of about 2\u201310, as assessed from the brightness                     of fluorescence from the photosynthetic pigments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). In accord with our hypothesis, this shows that                         <i>Synechocystis</i> phototaxis is essentially a photophobic                     response to selective excitation of one side of the cell. The data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a> indicate that this photophobic response is                     increasingly strong with stronger localized excitation: thus, when the cells                     encounter laser light that is stronger than the focused light spot at the rear                     edge of the cell, they change direction to move away from the laser light."

Two air-cooled electron-multiplying                                     charge-coupled device (EMCCD) cameras were coupled to the camera                                     port of the microscope via a magnifying relay. The cameras were                                     simultaneously triggered using a TTL                                     (transistor-transistor\u00a0logic)\u00a0pulse from an                                     external digital-to-analog converter, with an exposure time of                                     50 ms and a frequency of 0.25 Hz. A dichroic mirror in the                                     Fourier plane of the camera relay split the emission into red                                     (fluorescence) and green (transmission bright-field imaging)                                     channels. Each channel had a separate band\u00a0pass filter.                                     The focused laser spot was generated by expanding a collimated                                     beam from a fiber-coupled continuous wave\u00a0(CW) diode                                     laser, injected via the epifluorescence port of the microscope                                     and directed to the objective lens via a dichroic filter. The                                     beam was expanded to overfill the back aperture of the objective                                     lens to achieve a diffraction-limited spot at the focal plane. A                                     combination of neutral density\u00a0filters and a half-wave                                     plate and polarizing beam splitter were used to adjust the power                                     of the laser to approximately 0.01 \u03bcW. A 1:1 lens pair                                     with one lens mounted on a Z-translation stage was used to                                     adjust the axial position of the focus at the sample plane. A                                     quarter-wave plate was used to circularly polarize the beam                                     before it was injected into the microscope. The laser intensity                                     profile is shown in (<b>b</b>). Bright-field                                     trans-illumination was performed by fiber-coupling a 530 nm LED                                     into a multimode fiber and imaging the magnified end of the                                     fiber at the sample plane using a condenser lens. The LED was                                     TTL triggered from via the camera acquisition to reduce light                                     exposure to the cells, resulting in a synchronized 50 ms pulse                                     during acquisition. A third LED (625 nm, 3 mW) was mounted close                                     to the sample at an oblique angle to provide directional                                     illumination for the motility assay.\u00a0LED, light emitting                                     diode."

This implies that positive phototaxis (i.e.                     movement towards a light source) is actually triggered as a negative response to                     the focused spot of light at rear periphery of the cell.

As predicted by our hypothesis, cells moved                     away from localized laser excitation that was only slightly brighter than the                     focused image of the light source (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure                         4</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

We previously examined the localization of one                     of these motor ATPases in <i>Synechocystis</i> with GFP-tagging (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schuergers et al., 2015</a>). We were unable                     to generate a strain with functional GFP-tagged PilT, but a strain expressing                     PilB1-GFP in a \u2206<i>pilB1</i> null background was motile and                     capable of phototaxis, albeit with lower efficiency than the wild type (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schuergers et al., 2015</a>). Imaging of                     PilB1-GFP in <i>Synechocystis</i> shows that it is localized in a                     crescent-like zone of the plasma membrane at one side of the cell, and that                     these patches can dynamically relocate to other areas of the membrane (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schuergers et al., 2015</a>). For cells                     without directional illumination, random relocation of the PilB1-GFP patch                     frequently occurs within a 5 min window. The direction of motility in                         <i>Synechocystis</i> strongly correlates with the position of the                     PilB1 patch, indicating that direction is determined by the localization of                     PilB1, probably in concert with other T4P components such as PilT (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schuergers et al., 2015</a>). In                         <i>Myxococcus xanthus,</i> both PilB and PilT show dynamic                     relocalization between the two cell poles, on comparable timescales (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bulyha et al., 2009</a>)."

In addition, motility                     is modulated by the second messengers cyclic diguanylate monophosphate                     (c-di-GMP) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Savakis et al., 2012</a>) and                     cyclic adenosine\u00a0monophosphate\u00a0(cAMP) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Terauchi and Ohmori, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bhaya et al., 2006</a>). However, the best-characterized                     candidate for a directional photoreceptor for positive phototaxis is PixJ1 (also                     known as TaxD1). Mutants in which the <i>pixJ1</i> gene is inactivated                     show only negative phototaxis (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yoshihara et                         al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhaya et al.,                     2001</a>).

Proteomic studies with cell                     fractionation indicate that PixJ1 is located in the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pisareva et al., 2007</a>) and this is an                     important consideration for our model."

The bright focused image of the                     light source is perceived by PixJ1 in the plasma membrane, resulting in local                     changes in the phosphorylation status of the response regulators PixG and/or                     PixH, which leads to local inactivation of the T4P motility apparatus and                     dispersal of the motor proteins (PilB1 and likely also PilT). The motility                     apparatus therefore assembles at the side of the cell facing the light,                     resulting in movement towards the source (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure                         5</a>). The 1 min timescale for direction switching in                         <i>Synechocystis</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure                         1f</a>) is consistent with the rapid kinetics of relocalization of PilB1                     patches (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schuergers et al., 2015</a>).                     Responses to multiple light sources (as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) can                     be explained if it is assumed that the dispersal signal is graded with light                     intensity. Thus when a cell is exposed to a stronger light source at one edge                     (as with cells encountering the focused laser spot in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video                         2</a>), the motility apparatus is always most strongly inactivated in the                     region of strongest local illumination."

Among the unicellular cyanobacteria, a number of species of the                     genera <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Gloeocapsa</i> are                     described as motile and phototactic, and these species do indeed have spherical                     or near-spherical cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rippka et al.,                         1979</a>).

Phototaxis in the                     larger cells of some unicellular eukaryotic green algae is mediated by clusters                     of photoreceptors known as eyespots, coupled with complex shading and reflecting                     devices (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kreimer, 2009</a>).

It is based on a detection-association tracking approach that relies on                     the Laplacian of Gaussian filter (LoG) for the task of bacteria detection (<a href=\"#bib14\">Esteves et al., 2013a</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib15\">Esteves et al., 2013b</a>). The LoG filter is                     based on the image scale-space representation to enhance the blob-like structure                     as introduced by Lindeberg (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lindeberg,                         1994</a>). The scale of the LoG filter is set to the expected range of                     the bacterial radius. The bacteria detection is performed by finding local                     maxima of LoG response in the input image (number of patches for local maxima                     detection controlled manually by a parameter). The detected maxima enable the                     estimation of bacteria location. We performed bacteria tracking based on the                     spatial distance between detections in consecutive frames (<a href=\"#bib15\">Esteves et al., 2013b</a>). Data analysis of the raw tracks                     was done using R software (R\u00a0Core<a href=\"#bib36\">Team,                         2013</a>) implementing the CIRCULAR package (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agostinelli and Lund, 2013</a>). To eliminate artifacts due to                     wrong mapping of dividing cells or cells in densely populated areas, only cells                     that could be tracked for at least 25 consecutive frames with an average                     velocity below 0.4 \u00b5m s<sup>\u20131</sup> and a maximum displacement of                     less than 8 \u00b5m between two frames (3 s) were considered. Cells with an                     average velocity lower than 0.05 \u00b5m s<sup>\u20131</sup> were regarded                     as immotile and discarded. Displacement and orientation were calculated for all                     cells that could be continuously tracked for 60 frames, during 5 min after the                     onset of the directional light. All the data shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> are from a single continuous experiment to ensure                     the reliability of quantitative comparisons. The experiment is representative of                     &gt;10 such experiments carried out under comparable conditions."

An absorption spectrum for                     the culture was recorded in an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer (Olis Inc,                     Bogart, GA), which is equipped with a wide detection window to minimize                     distortion due to light scattering. After subtraction of the optical density due                     to light scattering at 750 nm, the absorption spectrum was deconvoluted into                     chlorophyll and phycobilin components and chlorophyll and phycocyanobilin                     concentrations were estimated according to the formulae of <a href=\"#bib32\">Myers et al. (1980)</a>. Cell density in the suspension was                     estimated by counting in a hemocytometer, leading to estimates of 2.94 \u00d7                         10<sup>7</sup> chlorophyll molecules and 3.70 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup>                     phycocyanin-coupled phycocyanobilin molecules per cell. These numbers are                     slightly higher than previously estimated\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Mann et al., 2000</a>); however, this study used different                     growth conditions. Effective pigment concentrations in the thylakoid membranes                     were then estimated by approximating the multiple thylakoid lamellae around the                     periphery of the cytoplasm as a hollow sphere with inner diameter 1 \u00b5m                     and outer diameter 2 \u00b5m, corresponding to the dimensions estimated from                     fluorescence micrographs. Pigments were assumed to be evenly distributed within                     the hollow sphere. A narrow light\u00a0beam passing straight through the                     center of the cell would then have a total path-length of 1 \u00b5m through an                     effective chlorophyll concentration of 6.7 mM and an effective phycocyanobilin                     concentration of 8.4 mM. This would give a peak single\u00a0cell absorbance of                     0.106 at 620 nm from the published extinction coefficients (<a href=\"#bib32\">Myers et al., 1980</a>). To estimate the full                     single\u00a0cell absorption spectrum, the absorption spectrum for the culture                     was scaled appropriately. The scaled spectrum was converted into the                     transmission spectrum shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>.                     Note that the calculation considers only light passing straight through the                     center of the cell and ignores any effects due to refraction and interference.                     In reality, the photosynthetic pigments will not be evenly distributed in the                     thylakoid region as we had to assume for the calculation, but rather clustered                     into membrane layers, reaction centers and light-harvesting complexes.                     Furthermore, the membranes themselves are usually not as regular and symmetrical                     as assumed in our model. A homogeneous distribution of pigments will maximize                     the absorption, since inhomogeneous clustering is liable to decrease absorption                     due to enhanced mutual shading of pigments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duysens, 1956</a>). Therefore, the spectrum shown represents a minimum                     estimate of light transmission through a single cell."

Cells were                     grown in liquid culture to OD<sub>750nm</sub> ~1.0 in BG11 medium                     supplemented with 50 \u00b5g ml<sup>\u20131</sup> spectinomycin. 100                     \u00b5l of culture was added to a chamber in an ibiTreat-coated 8-well                     \u00b5-slide from ibidi and cells were\u00a0left for 10 min to settle at the                     bottom. Suspended cells and excess medium were removed from the chamber, leaving                     adhered cells and a thin film of liquid, with some areas of the chamber bottom                     appearing dry. The samples were imaged immediately. Microscopy was performed                     using a modified version of the laser-spot time-lapse microscope (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).                     Fluorescence excitation was achieved by near-TIRF (\u201chighly                     inclined\u201d/\u201doblique\u201d) illumination of the samples. Briefly,                     a fiber-coupled continuous wave\u00a0(CW)\u00a0diode laser (Toptica iChrome                     HP, 488 nm, Toptica, Germany) was injected into the epifluorescence port of the                     microscope via the dichroic mirror. The fiber, collimator, quarter-wave plate                     and TIR-lens (Thorlabs AC254-200-A-ML, Thorlabs, UK) were mounted on a                     translation stage and positioned such that the focused beam was centered at the                     back focal plane (BFP) of the Olympus 100\u00d7 objective lens (UPON TIRF 1.49                     NA oil) (Olympus, Japan). By adjusting the translation stage, the position of                     the beam could be translated across the BFP to adjust the inclination angle of                     the beam through the sample. Images were captured using the green channel using                     a GFP filter set (Semrock FF01-520/35-25, Semrock, Rochester, NY) and an                     exposure time of 100 ms. Average images were generated by frame averaging over                     1\u20132 s. Measurements were taken from a single experimental run,                     representative of images recorded for three separate cultures of                         <i>Synechocystis torA-gfp</i>. Fluorescent profiles for spot                     intensity and FWHM measurements were obtained from the intensity profile of                     hand-fitted spline curves to the circumference of the cell image starting at the                     edge opposite to the focus spot (proximal to illumination source) and tracing in                     an anti-clockwise direction back to the origin. The line width was 3 pixels and                     the analysis was done in ImageJ."

SU-8 3005 was coated at a final                     rotation speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s, after which the photosensitive film was                     subjected to a soft bake at 95\u00b0C for 5 hr. Droplets (4 \u03bcl) of an                     exponentially growing <i>Synechocystis</i> culture in BG11 medium were                     dispensed on top of the 5 \u00b5m thick photoresist.

Flood exposure of                     the photopolymer was performed at a center wavelength of 365 nm (MA6 exposure                     system, Karl Suess, S\u00dcSS MicroTec AG, Germany). The exposure dose of 85                     mJ cm<sup>\u20132</sup> was found by a lithographic series, in order to                     achieve sharp rendering of scattering patterns on the SU-8 film. However, the                     SU-8 layer was not exposed entirely and rendered a height-dependent cross-linked                     structure similar to grayscale lithography (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gal, 1994</a>). Height profiles of the scattering pattern were obtained                     by atomic force microscopy (tapping-mode, Dimension Icon, Bruker Nano Surfaces                     Division, Santa Barbara, CA). Completely exposed SU-8 patterns had a median                     roughness of R<sub>a</sub> = 3.2 nm. From the scattering patterns, a mean of six                     axially symmetric profiles was computed in order to average out the influence of                     surface roughness."

Fingers of cells projecting                     0.3\u20130.5 cm were seen after ~16 hrs. The leading edges of the                     fingers were collected and resuspended in 20\u201350 \u00b5l of BG11 medium                     and spotted onto freshly made motility plates and left to adsorb. Blocks of the                     motility agarose containing the spots were excised from the plate and inverted                     onto 35 mm glass-bottomed tissue-culture dishes for imaging in a custom-built                     inverted microscope. The time\u00a0lapse microscope (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was constructed on                     the base of an Olympus IX81 microscope, using an Olympus 40\u00d7 (UPLANFLUOR                     0.75 NA Air) objective lens. Two air-cooled EMCCD cameras (Andor iXon Ultra                     DU-897U-CS0-#BV, Andor, UK) were coupled to the camera port of the microscope                     via a magnifying relay. The cameras were simultaneously triggered using a TTL                     pulse from an external\u00a0digital-to-analog\u00a0(D/A) converter (Data                     Translation DT9834, Data Translation, Germany), with an exposure time of 50 ms                     and a frequency of 0.25 Hz. A dichroic mirror (Semrock FF560-FDi01-25x36) in the                     Fourier plane of the camera relay split the emission into red (fluorescence) and                     green (transmission bright-field imaging) channels. Each channel had a separate                     band\u00a0pass filter (Semrock BLP01-647R-25\u200b and Semrock                     FF01-520/35-25). The focused laser spot was generated by expanding a collimated                     beam from a fiber-coupled CW diode laser (Toptica iChrome HP, 640 nm), injected                     via the epifluorescence port of the microscope and directed to the objective                     lens via a dichroic filter (Semrock Di01-R405/488/561/635-25x36). The beam was                     expanded to overfill the back aperture of the objective lens to achieve a                     diffraction-limited spot at the focal plane. A combination of neutral density                     filters and a half-wave plate and polarizing beam splitter were used to adjust                     the power of the laser to approximately 0.01 \u03bcW as measured using a power                     meter. A 1:1 lens pair (Thorlabs AC254-100-A-ML) with one lens mounted on a                     Z-translation stage was used to adjust the axial position of the focus at the                     sample plane. A quarter-wave plate was used to circularly polarize the beam                     before it was injected into the microscope. Bright-field trans-illumination was                     performed by fiber-coupling a 530 nm LED (Thorlabs M530F1) into a multimode                     fiber and imaging the magnified end of the fiber at the sample plane using a                     condenser lens. The LED was TTL triggered via the camera acquisition to reduce                     light exposure to the cells, resulting in a synchronized 50 ms pulse during                     acquisition. A third LED (625 nm, 3 mW) was mounted close to the sample at an                     oblique angle to provide directional illumination for the motility assay. Light                     intensities were measured with a silicon photodiode-based power meter (Thorlabs                     S120C and PM100D). Acquisition was performed over 30 min.

Though I endorse including the details in the Methods and legends                     to satisfy photoreception, phototaxis, and optical biology experts, I would                     encourage the authors to envision presenting the work to a much larger audience                     with rudimentary optics knowledge, but interest in many aspects of biology.                     Reviewers most often ask for manuscripts to be condensed, but in this case, I                     ask that the text be expanded with the goal of making the study more                     accessible.</i>"

                    "text": "We feel that the conclusion from this figure, that a single                     <i>Synechocystis</i> cell absorbs only a relatively small proportion                 of the light passing through it, is important when considering how light intensity                 will vary within and around the cell, which is a theme central to our paper.                 Therefore we would prefer to present this figure prominently so that we can be                 up-front about our arguments. The reviewer does not raise any specific technical                 problems with the estimate of a single-cell transmission spectrum but is clearly not                 comfortable with the discussion. In the revised paper we have tried to explain more                 clearly how we derived the transmission spectrum (legend to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The reviewer\u2019s comment about the                 \u201cvery dark green cells\u201d actually illustrates a common misconception                 about cyanobacteria, which perhaps reinforces the need to include the figure.                 Individual cells are not actually very dark green, although of course dense cultures                 are. Within an individual cell the local pigment concentration is quite high (as                 indicated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) but the optical                 path-length is exceedingly short and therefore the overall light absorption is                 small. The direct measurement of single-cell absorption spectra is technically very                 challenging, and actually we are aware of only one good example in the literature                 for cyanobacteria. This is the pioneering work of Sugiura and Itoh (Plant &amp; Cell                 Physiology, 2012) which we cite and discuss in the revised paper (lines 125-129).                 These authors present single-cell absorption spectra for a species of Nostoc with                 cell diameter a little larger than <i>Synechocystis</i>. The peak                 single-cell absorption is about 0.04, corresponding to a minimum transmittance of                 over 0.9 (ie over 90% of photons go straight through the cell). Therefore our                 estimate of a minimum transmittance for a <i>Synechocystis</i> cell of                 about 0.8 is not at all out of line."
