                    "text": "Bacterial phototaxis was first recognized over a century ago, but the method by\n                    which such small cells can sense the direction of illumination has remained\n                    puzzling. The unicellular cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC\n                    6803 moves with Type IV pili and measures light intensity and color with a range\n                    of photoreceptors. Here, we show that individual <i>Synechocystis</i>\n                    cells do not respond to a spatiotemporal gradient in light intensity, but rather\n                    they directly and accurately sense the position of a light source. We show that\n                    directional light sensing is possible because <i>Synechocystis</i>\n                    cells act as spherical microlenses, allowing the cell to see a light source and\n                    move towards it. A high-resolution image of the light source is focused on the\n                    edge of the cell opposite to the source, triggering movement away from the\n                    focused spot. Spherical cyanobacteria are probably the world\u2019s smallest\n                    and oldest example of a camera eye."

                    "text": "Bacterial phototaxis was first recognized over a century ago, but the method by\n                    which such small cells can sense the direction of illumination has remained\n                    puzzling. The unicellular cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC\n                    6803 moves with Type IV pili and measures light intensity and color with a range\n                    of photoreceptors. Here, we show that individual <i>Synechocystis</i>\n                    cells do not respond to a spatiotemporal gradient in light intensity, but rather\n                    they directly and accurately sense the position of a light source. We show that\n                    directional light sensing is possible because <i>Synechocystis</i>\n                    cells act as spherical microlenses, allowing the cell to see a light source and\n                    move towards it. A high-resolution image of the light source is focused on the\n                    edge of the cell opposite to the source, triggering movement away from the\n                    focused spot. Spherical cyanobacteria are probably the world\u2019s smallest\n                    and oldest example of a camera eye."

When moving through a spatial concentration\n                gradient of an attractant, <i>E. coli</i> cells experience temporal\n                concentration changes, which they sense by employing a biochemical memory that\n                directs a \u201cbiased random walk\u201d. Swimming along a straight path (run)\n                alternates with random changes of direction (tumble). Tumbles become less frequent\n                when cells sense a temporal increase in attractant concentration, introducing a bias\n                to movement up a concentration gradient (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berg and\n                    Brown, 1972</a>)."

Bacterial phototaxis was\n                first noted in 1883 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Engelmann, 1883</a>) and\n                has been characterized in free-swimming phototrophs including purple bacteria and\n                    <i>Halobacterium</i> spp. (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hildebrand and Dencher, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alam and\n                    Oesterhelt, 1984</a>).

Here, we establish that individual <i>Synechocystis</i>\n                cells can directly and accurately perceive the position of a unidirectional light\n                source, and control their motility so as to move towards it. We then show that\n                    <i>Synechocystis</i> cells act as microlenses, and that the light\n                intensity gradient across the cell due to this lensing effect is far greater than\n                the effects of shading due to light absorption or reflection. Finally, we use\n                highly-localized laser excitation to show that specific excitation of one side of\n                the cell triggers movement away from the light, indicating that positive phototaxis\n                results from movement away from an image of the light source focused on the opposite\n                side of the cell. Essentially, the cell acts as a microscopic eyeball."

First, we tested the response of\n                    cells to a light intensity gradient projected onto the surface from the\n                    microscope condenser (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), using a\n                    gradient of white light from 0\u201320 \u00b5mol photons\n                        m<sup>\u20132</sup> s<sup>\u20131</sup>, an intensity range that is\n                    relevant for positive phototaxis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choi et al.,\n                        1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bhaya, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chau et al., 2015</a>). However, the cells\n                    moved randomly without any significant directional bias (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video\n                        1</a>). If <i>Synechocystis</i> phototaxis were based on a\n                    biochemical memory like <i>E. coli</i> chemotaxis, cells would\n                    perceive temporal changes in light intensity as they move across the surface\n                    through the light gradient and would then accumulate in regions of optimal light\n                    intensity. This did not occur (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>,\n                        <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). By contrast, when cells\n                    were illuminated by a unidirectional light source (RGB illumination at 10\n                    \u00b5mol photons m<sup>\u20132</sup> s<sup>\u20131</sup>) at an angle\n                    oblique to the surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), the\n                    majority of motile cells switched direction within about 1 min, and then moved\n                    directly towards the light source (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure\n                        1c,d,f</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Under\n                    illumination from two equal-intensity orthogonal light sources, the majority of\n                    cells moved towards a point midway between the two light sources (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These behaviors are not consistent with a\n                    run-and-tumble mechanism or any kind of biased random walk. In accord with\n                    previous studies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choi et al., 1999</a>;\n                        <a href=\"#bib9\">Chau et al., 2015</a>), we conclude that\n                    individual cells can directly and accurately perceive the position of a light\n                    source and control their motility accordingly."

To assess the plausibility of this\n                    idea, we estimated the transmission spectrum of a single motile cell, scaling\n                    the absorption spectrum for a cell suspension according to the mean cellular\n                    pigment content. To ensure that pigment content was appropriate for phototactic\n                    cells, we used cells taken from moving colonies on motility plates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The transmission spectrum shows\n                    that even at peak absorption wavelengths, a single cell can absorb only about\n                    20% of the photons that pass through it (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure\n                        2</a>). Although local pigment concentrations within the cell are quite\n                    high (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), the very short optical\n                    path\u00a0length means that light\u00a0absorption by the cell is low. Note\n                    that our estimate assumes a homogeneous distribution of pigments within the\n                    thylakoid region of the cell: in reality, pigment clustering will tend to\n                    decrease the cell absorbance due to enhanced self-shading of pigments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duysens, 1956</a>). Thus, 20% represents a\n                    maximum estimate of the proportion of photons that can be absorbed, and the\n                    light intensity gradient across the cell due to shading must be almost\n                    negligible. The direct measurement of single\u00a0cell absorption spectra is\n                    technically challenging, and we are aware of only one such measurement in the\n                    literature for a cyanobacterium. <a href=\"#bib47\">Sugiura and\n                        Itoh (2012)</a> show that the peak absorbance for a single cell of\n                        <i>Nostoc</i> sp. is about 0.04. This corresponds to a peak\n                    absorption of about 10% of the photons that pass through the cell, which is even\n                    lower than our estimate for <i>Synechocystis</i>."

Therefore,\n                    to quantify the lensing effect, we first employed a\n                        <i>Synechocystis</i> mutant that accumulates green fluorescent\n                    protein (GFP) evenly distributed in the periplasm (<a href=\"#bib45\">Spence et al., 2003</a>). Thus, GFP can be used as local\n                    reporter of light intensity at the cell periphery (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>) since GFP fluorescence will be proportional to\n                    the local excitation light intensity. GFP fluorescence images with oblique laser\n                    excitation show a spot of light sharply focused at the opposite edge of the\n                    cell. Profiles of GFP fluorescence around the cell perimeter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>) indicate that the mean ratio of\n                    the light intensity at the center of this focused spot to the intensity at the\n                    front of the cell facing the light source was 4.1 \u00b1 1.5 (mean and\n                    standard\u00a0deviation, <i>n</i> = 13 cells from one representative\n                    experiment) and the observed mean full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the\n                    focused spot was 609 \u00b1 30 nm (mean and standard\u00a0deviation,\n                        <i>n</i> = 11 cells). Since the measured FWHM for the point-spread\n                    function of the microscope was 270 nm, the true FWHM for the focused spot of 488\n                    nm light at the cell periphery can be estimated to be about 550 nm. This\n                    experiment shows that for 488 nm light, lensing effects leading to concentration\n                    of light at the opposite side of the cell from the light source are\n                    overwhelmingly greater than shading effects, which would lead to higher light\n                    intensity on the illuminated side of the cell.

This\n                    electromagnetic description traces all observed effects back to the interference\n                    of incoming waves with waves scattered by their encounter with the object, which\n                    in this case was a simplified model of the cell as a microsphere with uniform\n                    refractive index. The method predicts a combination of effects that, on larger\n                    scales, are described as interference, refraction and internal reflection. We\n                    found that the observed near-field light pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>) could be accurately reproduced by an FDTD\n                    simulation approximating the cell as a dielectric sphere with a diameter of 3\n                    \u00b5m and a refractive index of 1.4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure\n                        3f</a>). Microspheres with similar dimensions to\n                        <i>Synechocystis</i> have been experimentally shown to produce\n                    similar sharply\u00a0focused light beams at the edge of the object opposite to\n                    the light source: these are termed \u201cphotonic nanojets\u201d (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ferrand et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Heifetz et al., 2009</a>)."

We tested this idea by using a\n                    highly\u00a0focused laser light spot (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lowe\n                        et al., 2015</a>) as an alternative way to selectively illuminate one\n                    edge of the cell. <i>Synechocystis</i> cells moving directionally on\n                    an agarose surface towards a red (625 nm) light emitting diode (LED) light\n                    source were visualized by fluorescence from the photosynthetic pigments excited\n                    by the LED light. Focused spots of light at the rear periphery of the cell were\n                    again observed under this illumination regime (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>),\n                    showing that the focused light spots extend into the thylakoid membrane region.\n                    The moving cells were allowed to encounter a spot of 640 nm laser light focused\n                    on the agarose surface (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The intensity gradient at the\n                    edge of the laser spot was steep enough to ensure specific exposure of one side\n                    of the cell to the light (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>).\n                    Whenever one edge of a cell encountered the edge of the laser spot, the cell\n                    changed direction to move away from the laser illumination (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video\n                        2</a>). Cells did not cross the center of the intense laser spot, but\n                    instead changed direction when the laser light intensity at the front edge of\n                    the cell exceeded the intensity of the light spot focused by the cell at its\n                    rear periphery by a factor of about 2\u201310, as assessed from the brightness\n                    of fluorescence from the photosynthetic pigments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). In accord with our hypothesis, this shows that\n                        <i>Synechocystis</i> phototaxis is essentially a photophobic\n                    response to selective excitation of one side of the cell. The data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a> indicate that this photophobic response is\n                    increasingly strong with stronger localized excitation: thus, when the cells\n                    encounter laser light that is stronger than the focused light spot at the rear\n                    edge of the cell, they change direction to move away from the laser light."

A dichroic mirror in the\n                                    Fourier plane of the camera relay split the emission into red\n                                    (fluorescence) and green (transmission bright-field imaging)\n                                    channels. Each channel had a separate band\u00a0pass filter.\n                                    The focused laser spot was generated by expanding a collimated\n                                    beam from a fiber-coupled continuous wave\u00a0(CW) diode\n                                    laser, injected via the epifluorescence port of the microscope\n                                    and directed to the objective lens via a dichroic filter. The\n                                    beam was expanded to overfill the back aperture of the objective\n                                    lens to achieve a diffraction-limited spot at the focal plane. A\n                                    combination of neutral density\u00a0filters and a half-wave\n                                    plate and polarizing beam splitter were used to adjust the power\n                                    of the laser to approximately 0.01 \u03bcW. A 1:1 lens pair\n                                    with one lens mounted on a Z-translation stage was used to\n                                    adjust the axial position of the focus at the sample plane. A\n                                    quarter-wave plate was used to circularly polarize the beam\n                                    before it was injected into the microscope. The laser intensity\n                                    profile is shown in (<b>b</b>). Bright-field\n                                    trans-illumination was performed by fiber-coupling a 530 nm LED\n                                    into a multimode fiber and imaging the magnified end of the\n                                    fiber at the sample plane using a condenser lens. The LED was\n                                    TTL triggered from via the camera acquisition to reduce light\n                                    exposure to the cells, resulting in a synchronized 50 ms pulse\n                                    during acquisition. A third LED (625 nm, 3 mW) was mounted close\n                                    to the sample at an oblique angle to provide directional\n                                    illumination for the motility assay.\u00a0LED, light emitting\n                                    diode."

We previously examined the localization of one\n                    of these motor ATPases in <i>Synechocystis</i> with GFP-tagging (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schuergers et al., 2015</a>).

Imaging of\n                    PilB1-GFP in <i>Synechocystis</i> shows that it is localized in a\n                    crescent-like zone of the plasma membrane at one side of the cell, and that\n                    these patches can dynamically relocate to other areas of the membrane (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schuergers et al., 2015</a>). For cells\n                    without directional illumination, random relocation of the PilB1-GFP patch\n                    frequently occurs within a 5 min window.

The LoG filter is\n                    based on the image scale-space representation to enhance the blob-like structure\n                    as introduced by Lindeberg (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lindeberg,\n                        1994</a>). The scale of the LoG filter is set to the expected range of\n                    the bacterial radius.

Effective pigment concentrations in the thylakoid membranes\n                    were then estimated by approximating the multiple thylakoid lamellae around the\n                    periphery of the cytoplasm as a hollow sphere with inner diameter 1 \u00b5m\n                    and outer diameter 2 \u00b5m, corresponding to the dimensions estimated from\n                    fluorescence micrographs. Pigments were assumed to be evenly distributed within\n                    the hollow sphere. A narrow light\u00a0beam passing straight through the\n                    center of the cell would then have a total path-length of 1 \u00b5m through an\n                    effective chlorophyll concentration of 6.7 mM and an effective phycocyanobilin\n                    concentration of 8.4 mM. This would give a peak single\u00a0cell absorbance of\n                    0.106 at 620 nm from the published extinction coefficients (<a href=\"#bib32\">Myers et al., 1980</a>). To estimate the full\n                    single\u00a0cell absorption spectrum, the absorption spectrum for the culture\n                    was scaled appropriately. The scaled spectrum was converted into the\n                    transmission spectrum shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>.\n                    Note that the calculation considers only light passing straight through the\n                    center of the cell and ignores any effects due to refraction and interference.\n                    In reality, the photosynthetic pigments will not be evenly distributed in the\n                    thylakoid region as we had to assume for the calculation, but rather clustered\n                    into membrane layers, reaction centers and light-harvesting complexes.\n                    Furthermore, the membranes themselves are usually not as regular and symmetrical\n                    as assumed in our model. A homogeneous distribution of pigments will maximize\n                    the absorption, since inhomogeneous clustering is liable to decrease absorption\n                    due to enhanced mutual shading of pigments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duysens, 1956</a>). Therefore, the spectrum shown represents a minimum\n                    estimate of light transmission through a single cell."

The time\u00a0lapse microscope (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was constructed on\n                    the base of an Olympus IX81 microscope, using an Olympus 40\u00d7 (UPLANFLUOR\n                    0.75 NA Air) objective lens. Two air-cooled EMCCD cameras (Andor iXon Ultra\n                    DU-897U-CS0-#BV, Andor, UK) were coupled to the camera port of the microscope\n                    via a magnifying relay.

A dichroic mirror (Semrock FF560-FDi01-25x36) in the\n                    Fourier plane of the camera relay split the emission into red (fluorescence) and\n                    green (transmission bright-field imaging) channels.

The beam was\n                    expanded to overfill the back aperture of the objective lens to achieve a\n                    diffraction-limited spot at the focal plane. A combination of neutral density\n                    filters and a half-wave plate and polarizing beam splitter were used to adjust\n                    the power of the laser to approximately 0.01 \u03bcW as measured using a power\n                    meter. A 1:1 lens pair (Thorlabs AC254-100-A-ML) with one lens mounted on a\n                    Z-translation stage was used to adjust the axial position of the focus at the\n                    sample plane. A quarter-wave plate was used to circularly polarize the beam\n                    before it was injected into the microscope. Bright-field trans-illumination was\n                    performed by fiber-coupling a 530 nm LED (Thorlabs M530F1) into a multimode\n                    fiber and imaging the magnified end of the fiber at the sample plane using a\n                    condenser lens. The LED was TTL triggered via the camera acquisition to reduce\n                    light exposure to the cells, resulting in a synchronized 50 ms pulse during\n                    acquisition. A third LED (625 nm, 3 mW) was mounted close to the sample at an\n                    oblique angle to provide directional illumination for the motility assay.

                    "text": "We feel that the conclusion from this figure, that a single\n                    <i>Synechocystis</i> cell absorbs only a relatively small proportion\n                of the light passing through it, is important when considering how light intensity\n                will vary within and around the cell, which is a theme central to our paper.\n                Therefore we would prefer to present this figure prominently so that we can be\n                up-front about our arguments. The reviewer does not raise any specific technical\n                problems with the estimate of a single-cell transmission spectrum but is clearly not\n                comfortable with the discussion. In the revised paper we have tried to explain more\n                clearly how we derived the transmission spectrum (legend to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The reviewer\u2019s comment about the\n                \u201cvery dark green cells\u201d actually illustrates a common misconception\n                about cyanobacteria, which perhaps reinforces the need to include the figure.\n                Individual cells are not actually very dark green, although of course dense cultures\n                are. Within an individual cell the local pigment concentration is quite high (as\n                indicated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) but the optical\n                path-length is exceedingly short and therefore the overall light absorption is\n                small. The direct measurement of single-cell absorption spectra is technically very\n                challenging, and actually we are aware of only one good example in the literature\n                for cyanobacteria. This is the pioneering work of Sugiura and Itoh (Plant &amp; Cell\n                Physiology, 2012) which we cite and discuss in the revised paper (lines 125-129).\n                These authors present single-cell absorption spectra for a species of Nostoc with\n                cell diameter a little larger than <i>Synechocystis</i>. The peak\n                single-cell absorption is about 0.04, corresponding to a minimum transmittance of\n                over 0.9 (ie over 90% of photons go straight through the cell). Therefore our\n                estimate of a minimum transmittance for a <i>Synechocystis</i> cell of\n                about 0.8 is not at all out of line."

I understand that it was included to show that the lensing was not\n                    confined to Synechocystis, but the introduction and presentation were a\n                    distraction rather than an enhancement.
