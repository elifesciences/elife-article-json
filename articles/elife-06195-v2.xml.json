                    "text": "Bradykinin (Bk) is a potent inflammatory mediator that causes hyperalgesia. The action of Bk on the sensory system is well documented but its effects on motoneurons, the final pathway of the motor system, are unknown. By a combination of patch-clamp recordings and two-photon calcium imaging, we found that Bk strongly sensitizes spinal motoneurons. Sensitization was characterized by an increased ability to generate self-sustained spiking in response to excitatory inputs. Our pharmacological study described a dual ionic mechanism to sensitize motoneurons, including inhibition of a barium-sensitive resting K<sup>+</sup> conductance and activation of a nonselective cationic conductance primarily mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>. Examination of the upstream signaling pathways provided evidence for postsynaptic activation of B<sub>2</sub> receptors, G protein activation of phospholipase C, InsP3 synthesis, and calmodulin activation. This study questions the influence of motoneurons in the assessment of hyperalgesia since the withdrawal motor reflex is commonly used as a surrogate pain model."

The action of Bk on the sensory system is well documented but its effects on motoneurons, the final pathway of the motor system, are unknown. By a combination of patch-clamp recordings and two-photon calcium imaging, we found that Bk strongly sensitizes spinal motoneurons. Sensitization was characterized by an increased ability to generate self-sustained spiking in response to excitatory inputs. Our pharmacological study described a dual ionic mechanism to sensitize motoneurons, including inhibition of a barium-sensitive resting K<sup>+</sup> conductance and activation of a nonselective cationic conductance primarily mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>. Examination of the upstream signaling pathways provided evidence for postsynaptic activation of B<sub>2</sub> receptors, G protein activation of phospholipase C, InsP3 synthesis, and calmodulin activation. This study questions the influence of motoneurons in the assessment of hyperalgesia since the withdrawal motor reflex is commonly used as a surrogate pain model."

Earlier and indirect evidence suggested that Bk may transynaptically activate motoneurons through activation of transmitter release from primary nociceptive afferents (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dunn and Rang, 1990</a>). However, kinin, cleaved to Bk by kallikrein in inflammatory responses, is extensively distributed throughout the motor areas of the CNS (<a href=\"#bib93\">Walker et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Raidoo and Bhoola, 1998</a>) and in particular in the ventral horn of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib59\">Lopes and Couture, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Li et al., 1999</a>). Furthermore, Bk receptors have been detected in the membrane of spinal motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib60\">Lopes et al., 1995</a>) suggesting that pain-related behaviors such as the withdrawal reflex may also arise from a direct Bk-evoked sensitization of motoneurons. The purpose of our study was to determine whether direct activation of Bk receptors sensitizes lumbar motoneurons of neonatal rats and, if so, to characterize the ionic mechanisms involved."

This motor output was not exclusively caused by local reverberating circuits, because it persisted in the presence of the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate at a concentration that blocked the monosynaptic reflex (1.5 mM, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <i>right</i> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We tested whether a change in the motoneuronal processing of sensory inputs by Bk might contribute to an increase in the motor output. To avoid sustained ventral root discharge, subthreshold concentrations of Bk (0.5\u20131 \u00b5M) were used. With these low concentrations of Bk, the motoneuron spiking probability in response to supramaximal dorsal root stimulation was increased (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). Specifically, Bk had no effect on the transient short latency reflexes (number of events: 144 \u00b1 16 for control vs 143 \u00b1 14 during Bk; p = 0.68, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7) but recruited a long-lasting reflex (number of events: 537 \u00b1 104 for control vs 2493 \u00b1 1207 during Bk; p = 0.015, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7) such that the distribution of peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) shifted from unimodal to bimodal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). This long-lasting reflex has been previously shown to result from sustained firing of motoneurons involved in muscle spasms (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Li et al., 2004</a>)."

From a resting potential adjusted to \u221270 mV with bias current, an incrementing series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing pulses was delivered before and after bath application of Bk (4\u20138 \u00b5M). A few minutes (2\u20133 min) after the application of Bk, the major effect was an increase in motoneuron excitability, as reflected by a lower rheobase (528 \u00b1 118 pA for control vs 299 \u00b1 156 pA during Bk; p = 0.028, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). As a consequence, Bk evoked a leftward shift of the <i>f</i>-<i>I</i> curve to lower current values and a slight increase in the slope of the <i>f</i>-<i>I</i> curve (0.05 \u00b1 0.004 Hz/pA for control vs 0.06 \u00b1 0.006 Hz/pA during Bk; p = 0.027, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, current steps that elicited only a single spike prior to Bk typically induced repetitive spiking during Bk application (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The higher motoneuron excitability was associated with an apparent increase in input resistance (55.6 \u00b1 5.4 M\u03a9 for control vs 62.9 \u00b1 7.2 M\u03a9 during Bk; p = 0.004, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) as seen by the increased slope of the voltage responses to hyperpolarizing pulses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). Bk lowered the threshold for action potential generation (\u221250.0 \u00b1 2.1 mV for the control vs \u221252.8 \u00b1 2.5 mV during Bk; p = 0.009, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) which, although not wider (0.51 \u00b1 0.02 ms for control vs 0.51 \u00b1 0.02 ms during Bk; p = 0.77, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), was smaller in amplitude (67.0 \u00b1 2.3 mV for control vs 63.6 \u00b1 2.2 mV during Bk; p = 0.049, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Hyperpolarizing current steps evoked a marked depolarizing sag (inward rectification) which is often associated with activation of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current I<sub>h</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>); the amplitude of the sag was not affected by Bk (12 \u00b1 2.6% for control vs 12.3 \u00b1 2.5% during Bk; p = 0.95, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). However, the medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) was enhanced both in amplitude and duration (amplitude: \u22129.1 \u00b1 0.9 mV for the control vs \u221211.2 \u00b1 1.5 mV for Bk, p = 0.02; duration: 41.1 \u00b1 2.5 ms for control vs 48.6 \u00b1 3.4 ms for Bk, p = 0.014; Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In a recent publication, we demonstrated that at temperatures above 30\u00b0C, neonatal rat lumbar motoneurons show marked bistability, characterized by their ability to generate a slow afterdepolarization (sADP) that outlasted a brief high amplitude depolarizing pulse (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouhadfane et al., 2013</a>). Bk increased the amplitude of the post-stimulus sADP (11.2 \u00b1 1.4 mV for control vs 18 \u00b1 2.6 mV for Bk; p = 0.008, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and triggered self-sustained spiking in all motoneurons tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). These results show that Bk sensitizes motoneurons by increasing their excitability and promoting bistability."

                                "text": "To test whether Bk directly excites motoneurons, we recorded activity from 200 lumbar motoneurons in response to a brief (\u22642 min) bath application of Bk (8 \u00b5M). Among them, 154 (77%) displayed a reversible membrane depolarization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) while the remaining 46 had no responses. The onset of the depolarization was slow, taking close to 1 min to peak, and subsided slowly over 3\u20135 min during washout. During the peak of the depolarizing response, spikelets, indicative of electrical coupling to other neurons, were sometimes seen (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <i>inset</i>). The amplitude of the depolarization was not changed after blockade of glutamatergic input with kynurenate (1.5 mM) or by CNQX (10 \u00b5M) and AP-5 (20 \u00b5M) (92.9 \u00b1 17.8% of the control; p = 0.62, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 4 cells; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <i>right</i>). These effects were thus not exclusively caused by a feed-forward network of excitatory synaptic input to motoneurons, but rather probably involved a direct postsynaptic action. Supporting this idea, the Bk-induced depolarization persisted in the presence of 0.5\u20131 \u03bcM TTX (12.9 \u00b1 0.6 mV; n = 154; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The effects of Bk were fully reversible without tachyphylaxis; when Bk was repetitively applied at intervals of 20 min, the amplitude of the second response was not significantly reduced from the first response (95.6 \u00b1 13.9% of the first response; p = 0.22, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Previous indirect evidence suggested that Bk's actions on lumbar motoneurons were secondary to the activation of NK1 receptors by substance P released from primary afferent C-fibers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dunn and Rang, 1990</a>). To test this hypothesis, we added Bk in the presence of spantide (2\u20135 \u00b5M), a selective NK1 receptor antagonist (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.5 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#bib67\">Merali et al., 1988</a>), that has been shown to depress the responses of neonatal rat motoneurons to substance P (<a href=\"#bib100\">Yanagisawa and Otsuka, 1990</a>). Spantide did not attenuate Bk-induced responses (response in spantide 92.1 \u00b1 18% of control response; p = 0.62, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 4 cells; see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Note that the long-lasting reflex induced by Bk from an in vitro hemicord preparation was not occluded by spantide (2 \u00b5M) (number of events: 580 \u00b1 58 for control vs 1859 \u00b1 549 during Bk; p = 0.03, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 6; see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these results argue for a likely direct effect of Bk on lumbar motoneurons."

Under TTX, the selective B<sub>1</sub> agonist, Lys-[Des-Arg<sup>9</sup>]-Bk (Ki = 1.7 nM; <a href=\"#bib63\">Marceau et al., 1998</a>), at concentrations as high as 3 \u00b5M, failed to induce a significant depolarization (2.2 \u00b1 0.6 mV, n = 10 cells; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

                                "text": "To determine the ionic mechanisms involved, motoneurons were held by voltage-clamp at \u221270 mV, a potential close to the normal resting membrane potential (<a href=\"#bib90\">Tazerart et al., 2007</a>). To investigate the current in relative isolation, TTX (0.5 \u00b5M) was added in the aCSF. Under these conditions, Bk reversibly generated an inward current whose time course was similar to that seen in current-clamp recordings (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Part of the Bk response seems thus independent of voltage-gated channels. The inward current amplitude was steeply dependent on Bk concentration, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 680 nM and maximal amplitude (322 \u00b1 26 pA, n = 14) at 4\u20138 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The peak current density was 1.5 \u00b1 0.15 pA/pF (n = 14). In the following experiments, the Bk-sensitive current was investigated by means of slow voltage ramp to minimize inactivating voltage-gated currents. To ensure a maximum response and to avoid potential fluctuation of the effective peptide concentration, Bk was applied at 8 \u00b5M. A significant Bk-induced decrease in the slope conductance was observed in <i>I/V</i> curves (18.7 \u00b1 2.4 pA/mV before Bk vs 15.6 \u00b1 2.2 pA/mV during Bk; p = 0.016, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), an effect often interpreted as a consequence of the inhibition of a K<sup>+</sup> conductance. Consistent with this interpretation, the linear <i>I/V</i> relationship of the Bk-sensitive-current (obtained by subtracting the control from the Bk currents: <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <i>orange line with open circles</i>) reversed at an extrapolated value close to the predicted equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (E<sub>k</sub>: \u2212100 mV). The combination of traditional voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers [TEA (10 mM), 4-aminopyridine (2 mM), the HCN-channel blocker ZD7288 (20 \u00b5M)] and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker apamin (100 nM), did not change either the Bk-induced decrease in slope conductance (33.2 \u00b1 3.2 pA/mV before Bk vs 21.1 \u00b1 2.3 pA/mV during Bk; p = 0.02, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 15 cells; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D1</a>) or the peak depolarization magnitude measured in current clamp from \u221270 mV (94.5 \u00b1 15.8% of the control; p = 0.54, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D2</a>). The contribution of K<sup>+</sup> ions was further examined by raising the extracellular K<sup>+</sup> ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) to 9 mM, a manipulation that almost eliminates the driving force for K<sup>+</sup> at resting membrane potential by setting E<sub>k</sub> at \u223c \u221270 mV according the Nernst equation. Under high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, Bk still induced a depolarization from \u221270 mV without a measurable change in input resistance (45.3 \u00b1 13.9 M\u2126 before Bk vs 46.5 \u00b1 13.2 M\u2126 during Bk; p = 0.81, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells). However, the depolarization was significantly smaller than that seen in normal aCSF (64.2 \u00b1 17.7% of the control value measured in normal aCSF; p = 0.047, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). These data suggest that a second ionic component contributes to the Bk depolarization in addition to a reduction in K<sup>+</sup> conductances. The residual Bk-induced depolarization observed in high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> appears to be sodium-mediated because it disappeared after reducing [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> from 152 to 26 mM with equimolar choline-chloride (4.1 \u00b1 2.8% of the control value measured in high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>; p = 0.016, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 7 cells; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). In sum, our data indicate that there are at least two ionic components in the response to Bk: a K<sup>+</sup> component that produces an input resistance increase and likely involves a reduction of a resting K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and a Na<sup>+</sup> component that produces depolarization without measurable change in input resistance."

This apparent I<sub>CaN</sub> was also thermosensitive because lowering the temperature from 34 to 24\u00b0C induced a significant decrease in the Bk-induced depolarization at \u221270 mV in high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (26.2 \u00b1 9.8% of control values; p = 0.03, Wilcoxon paired test; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In sum, it appears that a current with properties of a thermosensitive I<sub>CaN</sub> might account for part of the Bk-induced depolarization."

We therefore examined whether an increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) was required for the Bk-induced depolarization. To demonstrate a Bk-induced rise of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in motoneurons, we first loaded the ventral horn with the calcium indicator Oregon Green-BAPTA 1 AM (OGB1-AM) along with the glial cell marker Sulforhodamine-101 (SR-101) using the extracellular bolus loading technique (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Since the astroglial cells were labeled by both dyes, they appeared as yellow cells, while neurons were labeled by green OGB1-AM only. This allowed the clear separation of neurons from astroglial cells. After a brief equilibration period, we imaged calcium changes from somata of lumbar motoneurons using a three-dimensional random-access two-photon microscope (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Bk induced a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (13.4 \u00b1 0.7% \u0394F/F) in 65% of motoneuron somata (n = 177 out of 272 cells; n = 5 slices), with very slow decay times (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>); there was no change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the remaining motoneurons. In the next step, we explored the relationship between spatio-temporal changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in motoneuron somata and dendrites along with the Bk-induced membrane depolarization. Here, the patch pipette was filled with the cell-impermeable calcium indicator OGB1 (120 \u00b5M) and a morphometric dye, Alexa 594 (20 \u00b5M) to allow simultaneous two-photon imaging and anatomical tracing of the cellular processes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). After Bk application, the proximal dendrites up to 50 \u00b5m away from the soma showed a clear rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (49.8 \u00b1 8.7% \u0394F/F; n = 5 cells; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>; <i>red trace</i>), which was followed with a delay by the somatic response (44.5e \u00b1 8.9% \u0394F/F; n = 5 cells; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>; <i>blue trace</i>). All of the above results were obtained with blocked voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels (0.5 \u00b5M TTX and 10 mM TEA, respectively), showing the Bk-induced response alone, without spiking activity of the motoneurons. To obtain a physiologically relevant comparison to the Bk-induced responses, we imaged [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes induced by action potentials evoked by depolarizing pulses in the absence of TTX and TEA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Our results show that a single action potential induced a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise significantly higher in the proximal dendrites than in the soma (Ca<sub>soma</sub> = 6.1 \u00b1 1.5% \u0394F/F; Ca<sub>dendrite</sub> = 16.9 \u00b1 3.6% \u0394F/F; n = 5 cells; p = 0.02, Student's paired <i>t</i>-test). The Bk-induced rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was significantly higher than that evoked by a single action potential in both the soma and the dendrites (p = 0.003 and p = 0.008, Student's unpaired <i>t</i>-test). In conclusion, the data obtained with calcium imaging show that Bk induces a significant increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>."

Blockade of NMDA-receptor channels with kynurenate (1.5 mM) or CNQX (10 \u00b5M) and AP-5 (20 \u00b5M) did not prevent the depolarization induced by Bk (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Similarly, the effects of Bk on motoneurons were not significantly reduced by cadmium blockade of voltage-gated calcium channels (100 \u00b5M; 83 \u00b1 9.7%, of control depolarization; p = 0.46, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 8 cells; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). The dependence of the depolarization on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was then studied by recording motoneurons after intracellular perfusion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelating agent BAPTA (10 mM) from the pipette solution. In these experiments, we applied Bk as soon as possible after establishing whole-cell access, so that we could record a control response before full diffusion of BAPTA into the cell. The first application caused a robust depolarization similar to that in the control cells (12.7 \u00b1 2.4 mV, n = 8 cells vs 12.9 \u00b1 0.6 mV for control, n = 154 cells, p = 0.94, Mann\u2013Whitney test). 20 minutes after establishing the whole cell recording, the depolarization induced by Bk declined to 28.8 \u00b1 6.4% of its original value (p = 0.008, Wilcoxon paired test, n = 8 cells; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>).

The actions of Bk in generating motor outputs have long been viewed as secondary to release of substance P from capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bynke et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Geppetti, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Jeftinija, 1994</a>). This indirect mechanism for exciting motoneurons is not used since the substance P receptor antagonist spantide did not antagonize responses to Bk in our study. Our results suggest a direct postsynaptic action of Bk on motoneurons that is still seen when sensory inputs are blocked by TTX or cadmium. Further supporting this, Bk receptors have been mapped to the membranes of motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib60\">Lopes et al., 1995</a>), Bk induces direct elevation of free calcium in motoneurons, and the depolarization in motoneurons is greatly reduced by calcium chelators infused into the motoneurons themselves. On the other hand, microglial cells express functional Bk receptors (<a href=\"#bib70\">Noda et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ifuku et al., 2007</a>) and Bk can act as a neuron-glia signaling molecule (<a href=\"#bib71\">Parpura et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Heblich et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, we cannot be rule out the possibility that bath-applied Bk activates glial cells resulting in the release of an unidentified chemical substance which may mediate some of Bk's effects on motoneurons."

                                "text": "Bk has long been shown to depolarize sensory neurons by inhibiting K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib95\">Weinreich, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Higashida, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jones et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Villarroel, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cruzblanca et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). We have found that inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> channels seems also to occur in motoneurons, as seen by a decrease of the slope conductance which reverses near E<sub>k</sub> and is influenced by changes in [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and addition of the K<sup>+</sup> blocker Ba<sup>2+</sup>. The Bk-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> current might be derived from a member(s) of the two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels that are substrates for resting K<sup>+</sup> currents in neurons (<a href=\"#bib28\">Enyedi and Czirjak, 2010</a>). This structurally distinct group of K<sup>+</sup> channels includes over 15 members classified into six functional subgroups: (1) TWIK-1 and -2; (2) TASK-1, -3 and -5; (3) TREK-1, and -2 and TRAAK; (4) TASK-2, TALK-1 and -2; (5) THIK-1; (6) TRESK. Functional distinction between K<sub>2P</sub> channel subtypes is still a delicate issue because of a lack of selective pharmacological reagents (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lesage, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Lotshaw, 2007</a>). However, several features help to separate them (<a href=\"#bib73\">Patel and Honore, 2001</a>). In addition to quinidine sensitivity, we show that the response to Bk is reduced by a low concentration of Ba<sup>2+</sup> but not by acidosis. The relatively weak pH sensitivity of the response is not consistent with the properties of TASK, TALK, and TRESK channels that are downregulated by acidosis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Duprat et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Sano et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kang and Kim, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dobler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Mathie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Callejo et al., 2013</a>). Likewise, the contribution of TREK/TRAAK channels is unlikely because they are weakly inhibited by or resistant to Ba<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lesage et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Patel and Honore, 2001</a>). Thus the most likely candidates for the Ba<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> current are TWIK and THIK channels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chavez et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Patel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Rajan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Lloyd et al., 2009</a>) though TWIK channels are much more sensitive to Ba<sup>2+</sup> (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.1 mM) than THIK (IC<sub>50</sub>: \u223c1 mM) (<a href=\"#bib73\">Patel and Honore, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Rajan et al., 2001</a>). The contribution of these channels in generating the Bk effects remains to be established."

This conductance shares features of I<sub>CaN</sub> (<a href=\"#bib72\">Partridge and Swandulla, 1988</a>), as it appears to be: (1) voltage-independent, (2) calcium-activated, (3) blocked by the cationic channel blocker ruthenium red, and (4) eliminated by lowering extracellular Na<sup>+</sup>. The fact that the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent conductance mediates a significant current without affecting the input resistance suggests that it may have a dendritic location and help regulate the flow of distal synaptic inputs to the soma. The initial rise of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> at the dendritic level supports this hypothesis and is consistent with the location of B<sub>2</sub> receptors in the peripheral processes of motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib60\">Lopes et al., 1995</a>). Channels capable of mediating a Na<sup>+</sup> response similar to that reported in this study are mammalian homologues of <i>Drosophilia</i> transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (<a href=\"#bib97\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with this, Bk has been shown to activate different classes of TRP channels (<a href=\"#bib77\">Premkumar and Ahern, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Delmas et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Sugiura et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bandell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>) and to induce a Na<sup>+</sup>-mediated I<sub>CaN</sub> in cultured spinal sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burgess et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dray et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">McGehee et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Seabrook et al., 1997</a>). The cationic current could be produced by gating of more than a single class of channels. Given the sensitivity of Bk-induced responses to temperature, thermo-TRP channels (including TRPV and TRPM) might be activated by Bk in motoneurons. Still, it should be stressed that additional studies will be necessary to precisely define the channel type(s) that mediate Bk responses."

The leftward shift in the <i>f</i>\u2013<i>I</i> relation can be explained as an increase in responsiveness due to an increase in input resistance. The depolarizing effect of the Na<sup>+</sup> current would also be enhanced by the simultaneous increase in input resistance due to reduction of a resting K<sup>+</sup> conductance. This synergistic mechanism might promote the burst-evoked sADP, which helps to generate self-sustained spiking (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouhadfane et al., 2013</a>). Following traumatic injury, increases in the concentration of kinins in the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib98\">Xu et al., 1991</a>) might thus predispose motoneurons to express self-sustained plateau potentials, thereby contributing to muscle spasms (<a href=\"#bib69\">Nickolls et al., 2004</a>). In keeping with this hypothesis, chronic spinal rats show the emergence of long-lasting reflexes in vivo (<a href=\"#bib68\">Murray et al., 2010</a>), similar to those we recorded in response to Bk in vitro (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

The flexor withdrawal motor reflex has commonly been used as a surrogate pain model (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barrot, 2012</a>); however, the contribution of motoneuron hyperexcitability has never been questioned. A role for Bk in hyperalgesic assessment methods at the level of motoneurons remains to be substantiated. It would be expected that excitation of sensory interneurons by Bk works in concert with direct sensitization of motoneurons to augment the withdrawal flexor reflex. It is also important to emphasize that the neonatal response to nociception differs from that found in adults (<a href=\"#bib32\">Fitzgerald, 2005</a>).

Astrocytes were identified through additional staining with the astrocytic marker Sulforhodamine-101 (300 \u00b5M SR-101), which permitted a clear separation of the astroglial (yellow) and neuronal (green) networks. According to the criteria stated above, motoneuron somata were manually selected in a three-dimensional space after acquiring a reference z-stack of the volume on a custom-built three dimensional fast acousto-optical trajectory scanning microscope (Femtonics Ltd, Budapest, Hungary) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Katona et al., 2012</a>) with a femtosecond pulsed laser tuned to 830 nm (Mai Tai HP, Spectra Physics, Mountain View, California). For each motoneuron selected, acquisition points were placed in the soma in the cytoplasmic area avoiding the nucleus. The selected neurons were imaged at 33 kHz/point. Imaging was controlled using the MES software package (Femtonics Ltd) based on Matlab (Mathworks). Fluorescence was measured as the average pixel value over selected somatic and proximal dendritic regions. Calcium changes were calculated as the relative change in fluorescence [\u0394F/F = (F \u2212 F<sub>0</sub>)/(F<sub>0</sub> \u2212 F<sub>b</sub>)], where F<sub>0</sub> is baseline fluorescence and F<sub>b</sub> is background fluorescence measured from a region lacking labeled cells away from the recorded area."

In these experiments, the recording electrodes (2\u20135 M\u03a9) contained 120 \u00b5M OGB-1 and 20 \u00b5M Alexa-594 (Life Technologies) dissolved in the same intracellular solution as stated above. To ensure equilibration between the pipette solution and cytosol, the acquisition was started at least 15 min after establishment of the whole-cell configuration. For each subcellular region of interest (soma and dendrites) five to ten acquisition points were manually defined, outside the region of the nucleus, and averaged during analysis. For simultaneous calcium imaging and whole cell recordings, detection of calcium transients was triggered by the onset of spikes or the onset of the Bk response measured in the electrophysiological recording. All imaging sessions were conducted at 34\u00b0C."

Only cells exhibiting a stable holding membrane potential, access resistance (no more than 20% variation) and an action potential amplitude larger than 45 mV were considered. All reported membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potentials. Passive membranes properties of cells were measured by determining from the holding potential the largest voltage deflections induced by small current pulses that avoided activation of voltage-sensitive currents. The input resistance and input conductance were measured by the slope of the linear portion of the I/V relationship. There was evidence of inward rectification (\u2018sag\u2019) during strong hyperpolarization. The size of the sag was measured from the voltage response of the cell to the hyperpolarizing current pulse adjusted to elicit peak voltage deflections to \u2212120 mV, and was defined as 100 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 Vss/Vpeak), where Vpeak was the peak voltage deflection from the holding potential (\u221270 mV) and Vss was the steady-state voltage deflection from the holding potential. Firing properties were investigated with 1-s-long depolarizing current pulses of varying amplitudes. Firing frequency was calculated as the average action potential frequency over the entire duration of the pulse. The rheobase was defined as the minimum current intensity necessary to induce an action potential. To investigate the action potentials and afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs), single spikes were evoked by brief intracellular pulses from a holding potential of \u221260 mV. Peak spike amplitude was measured from the threshold potential, and spike duration was defined as the width of the action potential at 50% of the peak. The peak amplitude and duration (to half of the peak height) of AHPs were measured from the holding potential. To investigate the sADP, a train of spikes was evoked by a 2-s current pulse at holding potential of \u221260 mV. The peak amplitude of the sADP was measured from the holding potential. The peak amplitude of the depolarization induced by bath application of Bk was measured from the holding potential. When the Bk-induced depolarization reached a steady-state level, the membrane potential was manually moved back to its original holding level for direct comparison of membrane properties before and during the application of the nanopeptide. A standard sigmoidal curve was fit to the relation between log of agonist dose and the Bk-induced depolarization. The dose that produced 50% of the maximal effect (EC<sub>50</sub>) was measured from the curve. To characterize the ionic mechanism(s) underlying the Bk-evoked depolarization, the membrane potential was initially held in voltage clamp at \u221270 mV, which approximates the resting membrane potential of motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib90\">Tazerart et al., 2007</a>), and then ramped to 0 mV over 3 s. To show the reversal potential, the <i>I\u2013V</i> relationship of the current was constructed by subtracting the <i>I\u2013V</i> relationship obtained before Bk application (control) from that performed in the presence of the nanopeptide. The current generated was fitted by a linear regression which was used to extrapolate the reversal potential at which the currents intersect."

As defined previously (<a href=\"#bib68\">Murray et al., 2010</a>), we computed the transient short latency and long-lasting reflexes over a window of 10\u201340 ms and 500\u20134000 ms post stimulus, respectively.

In most experiments, drugs were delivered via superfusion using a syringe pump. In some experiments, cells were loaded with BAPTA, GDP\u00dfS, or xestospongin C by passive diffusion from the patch pipette. In some experiments performed using the in vitro hemicord preparation, a pipette with a wide drip tip containing Bk was placed \u223c25\u201350 \u00b5M upstream of the ventral horn. Leakage of the solution from the pipette was monitored by including neutral red in the intrapipette solution. This configuration restricts the application of drug to the ventral horn (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and avoids mechanical artifacts."

The data set presented is extensive and the experiments are carefully done. The writing is clear and the figures well designed. Most of the conclusions depend on pharmacological analysis and although the specificity of the drugs is in several cases not high the preponderance of the evidence and the multiple drugs used produce a substantive story. The major conclusion is that Bk acts directly on motor neurons to increase their excitability by activating B2 receptors. The evidence is further interpreted that Bk acts via the single PLC/InsP3/calcium signaling pathway to inhibit leak K<sup>+</sup> current (likely TWIK channels) and activate ICaN (likely thermo-TRP channels). These results have important implications for enhanced withdrawal reflexes seen in injury-induced hypernociception."

In addition, all experiments were conducted with the highest concentration of Bk (rather than the EC50). Are these Bk concentrations relevant to in vivo levels?

The referee is correct that there is no direct evidence demonstrating that the Bk-dependent sensitization of motoneurons influences the withdrawal reflex.

First, the greater increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in dendrites compared to the soma suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated channels will be more affected in dendrites and thus may act to modify the integration of synaptic inputs of motoneurons.
