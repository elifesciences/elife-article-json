We report here the results of exhaustively sampling the conformational space in protein\u2013protein association using a physics-based energy function. The agreement between experimental intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) data and the PRE profiles calculated from the docked structures shows that the method captures both specific and non-specific encounter complexes. To explore the energy landscape in the vicinity of the native structure, the nonlinear manifold describing the relative orientation of two solid bodies is projected onto a Euclidean space in which the shape of low energy regions is studied by principal component analysis. Results show that the energy surface is canyon-like, with a smooth funnel within a two dimensional subspace capturing over 75% of the total motion. Thus, proteins tend to associate along preferred pathways, similar to sliding of a protein along DNA in the process of protein-DNA recognition."

We report here the results of exhaustively sampling the conformational space in protein\u2013protein association using a physics-based energy function. The agreement between experimental intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) data and the PRE profiles calculated from the docked structures shows that the method captures both specific and non-specific encounter complexes. To explore the energy landscape in the vicinity of the native structure, the nonlinear manifold describing the relative orientation of two solid bodies is projected onto a Euclidean space in which the shape of low energy regions is studied by principal component analysis. Results show that the energy surface is canyon-like, with a smooth funnel within a two dimensional subspace capturing over 75% of the total motion. Thus, proteins tend to associate along preferred pathways, similar to sliding of a protein along DNA in the process of protein-DNA recognition."

To recognize its partner, a protein must align its binding interface, usually a small fraction of the total surface, with a similarly small binding interface on the other protein (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berg and von Hippel, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ubbink, 2009</a>). Since all interactions are of relatively short range, the process must start with a diffusive search governed by Brownian motion, which brings the proteins to a \u2018macrocollision\u2019 to yield a transition state also known as the encounter complex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berg and von Hippel, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">von Hippel and Berg, 1989</a>). The encounter complex can be thought of as an ensemble of conformations in which the two molecules can rotationally diffuse along each other, or participate in a series of \u2018microcollisions\u2019 that properly align the reactive groups. The second step of association consists of conformational rearrangements to the native complex. While it has been generally recognized that association proceeds through a transition state, little was known of the encounter complex structures and configurations as their populations are low, their lifetimes are short, and they are difficult to trap, rendering them essentially invisible to conventional structural and biophysical methods (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iwahara and Clore, 2006</a>)."

On the experimental side, the major progress is due to the application of NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), a technique that is exquisitely sensitive to the presence of lowly populated states in the fast exchange regime (<a href=\"#bib9\">Clore, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clore and Iwahara, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fawzi et al., 2010</a>). The detection of such intermediates requires introducing paramagnetic labels, one at a time, at a few sites on one of the interacting proteins, and measuring the transverse paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) rates, <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub>, of the backbone amide protons (<sup>1</sup>H<sub>N</sub>) of the partner protein (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tang et al., 2006</a>). In a fast exchanging system, the observed value of <i>\u0393</i><sub><i>2</i></sub> is the weighted average of the values for the various states present in solution (<a href=\"#bib20\">Iwahara et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Iwahara and Clore, 2006</a>). Because <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> is dependent on the inverse sixth power of the distance (&lt;<i>r</i><sup>\u22126</sup>&gt;) between the unpaired electron on the paramagnetic center and the observed proton, and because the <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> rates at short distances are very large owing to the large magnetic moment of the unpaired electrons, low-population intermediates can be detected. In particular, the observed intermolecular <sup>1</sup>H<sub>N</sub>\u2212<i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> rates and those back-calculated from the structure of the native complex generally differ for a number of residues, revealing regions that participate in transitional interactions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tang et al., 2006</a>)."

A semi-quantitative depiction of the minor species can be obtained by using restrained rigid-body simulated annealing refinement to minimize the difference between observed and calculated <sup>1</sup>H<sub>N</sub>\u2212<i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> rates (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2008</a>). However, with the development of docking methods it is possible to globally sample the entire conformational space of two interacting proteins, generating all low energy states. Although in some cases binding is inherently coupled with folding (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shoemaker et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>), a large class of protein complexes can be adequately described by a model that assumes essentially rigid association, possibly followed by refinement that allows for local changes in side chains and interacting loops (<a href=\"#bib39\">Smith and Sternberg, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kozakov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vajda and Kozakov, 2009</a>). As demonstrated by the results of CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Prediction of Interactions) communitywide protein docking experiment, for such cases modern computational docking methods, including automated servers, are capable of generating docked conformations that agree well with the X-ray structure of the complex (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lensink and Wodak, 2013</a>). In particular, our program PIPER, based on the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation approach, globally and systematically samples the conformational space of two interacting proteins on a dense grid using a physics based energy function (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kozakov et al., 2006</a>). The program is implemented in the heavily used server ClusPro (<a href=\"#bib11\">Comeau et al., 2007</a>), which yields good results when docking X-ray structures of two proteins with at most moderate backbone conformational changes upon binding (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kozakov et al., 2010</a>). Based on the results of CAPRI, Cluspro has been the best protein\u2013protein docking server for the last 5 years (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kozakov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lensink and Wodak, 2013</a>)."

Since such \u2018false positive\u2019 models do not predict the final bound complex, they are usually regarded as artifacts. However, using molecular mechanics energy functions without \u2018built-in\u2019 information on the native state it is reasonable to assume that the alternative low energy models represent encounter complexes that, in view of their favorable interactions, may occur along association pathways. Accordingly, we show here that using the large ensemble of low energy structures generated by docking provides better approximation of experimental PRE profiles than the one calculated only from the coordinates of the final complex. Since in docking calculations we start from unbound protein structures and systematically sample the entire conformational space, based on this result we can easily generate ensembles of encounter complexes for any pair of associating proteins."

Since rigid body association occurs in a low dimensional space, the shape of the binding energy landscape can be studied in detail, in contrast to protein folding, which occurs in a very high dimensional space (<a href=\"#bib12a\">Dill and Chan, 1997</a>). In spite of the low dimensionality, the analysis is far from simple in this highly curved space due to the interdependence of the coordinates (<a href=\"#bib32\">Park, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Park and Ravani, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mirzaei et al., 2012</a>). However, one can transform the rotational space into a product of axis-angle representations using complex exponentials (<a href=\"#bib33\">Park and Ravani, 1997</a>). These so-called exponential parameters create a local one-to-one mapping between the nonlinear manifold of potential conformations and an Euclidean space (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mirzaei et al., 2012</a>), and thus the shape of low energy regions in the conformational space can be studied by classical principal component analysis (PCA) in the Euclidean space. Using PCA we will be able to determine whether any subspace can accommodate a large fraction of the structures, and whether there are energy barriers that restrict the distribution of encounter complexes in the vicinity of the native state."

Orthogonal to the restrictive subspace is a permissive subspace, in which the energy is relatively flat. Based on these results one can visualize the energy landscape as resembling a canyon-like terrain where the low energy areas (at the bottom of the canyon) lie in a lower dimensional subspace. Thus, within the range of physical interactions, two proteins sample only relatively small fractions of the conformational space, and converge toward the native state along preferred pathways. This result represents information that, in principle, could have been obtained by running molecular dynamics or Brownian dynamics simulations. However, a sufficiently dense sampling of conformational space by molecular dynamics is computationally very demanding, even when restricting considerations to a neighborhood of the native state (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang and Wade, 2003</a>), whereas Brownian dynamics simulations usually rely on highly simplified protein models (<a href=\"#bib4\">Camacho et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Spaar and Helms, 2005</a>). In contrast, we use detailed all-atom models and map the energy surface using two different physics-based energy functions. As will be shown, these differences do not significantly affect the results of the principal component analysis, suggesting that the reduction of dimensionality is an inherent property of the free energy landscape in protein\u2013protein association."

Specific association between the two proteins occurs in the first step of the bacterial phosphotransfer system, resulting in phosphoryl transfer between EIN and HPr upon proper alignment of active site histidines of the two sides of the interface (<a href=\"#bib15\">Garrett et al., 1999</a>). The binding has an equilibrium dissociation constant of 4.3 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#bib41\">Suh et al., 2008</a>). For the computational study of encounter complexes we have placed the center of EIN at the origin of a coordinate system, and systematically sampled the entire rotational/translational space of HPr. Unbound structures were used both for the receptor, EIN (chain A from PDB entry 1ZYM) and for the ligand, HPr (chain P from PDB entry 2JEL). Sampling was performed using the docking program PIPER, which performs exhaustive evaluation of a physics-based energy function in discretized 6D space of mutual orientations of two proteins using the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation approach (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kozakov et al., 2006</a>). We sample 70,000 rotations, which approximately correspond to sampling at every 5\u00b0 in the space of Euler angles. In the translational space, the sampling is defined by the 1.0 \u00c5 grid cell size. PIPER is used with a \u2018smooth\u2019 energy function that includes terms describing attractive and repulsive van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions calculated by a simplified generalized Born-type expression, and a desolvation terms, the latter represented by a pairwise interaction potential (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chuang et al., 2008</a>).

Each C-EDTA-Mn<sup>2+</sup> label has three potential rotameric states, and hence Mn<sup>2+</sup> can occupy three different positions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A separate docking was performed for each rotameric state of each EDTA-Mn<sup>2+</sup> probe. We retained the 10,000 lowest energy structures from each docking simulation, thus a total of 30,000 low energy structures for each of the two probes.

For the calculation of IRMD we first select the interface residues of HPr that are within 10 \u00c5 of any EIN atom in the native complex. For each docked structure we than superimpose EIN onto EIN in the X-ray structure of the complex, and calculate the RMSD between the C\u03b1 atoms of the HPr interface residues in docked and native structures. The structures in the largest cluster (shown in blue in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) overlap with the native state, with the lowest energy conformations being within 5 \u00c5 IRMSD from the native (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The structures in this cluster, termed Class I, are the results of rigid body rotations and small translations around the native binding mode. Two representative Class I structures are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>. Some Class I structures have less than 1 \u00c5 IRMSD, but the cluster extends as far as 15 \u00c5 IRMSD from the native. The two other clusters, termed Class II patch 1 and Class II patch 2, consist of structures that can coexist with the native complex. We note that while the three clusters clearly separate in the 3D representation shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, they substantially overlap when projected into one dimension as a function of their IRMSD values. Nevertheless, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows at least three distinguishable energy minima. Class II patch 1 (magenta in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) centers around a local energy minimum at around 17 \u00c5 IRMSD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> shows two representative conformations for this patch. The third large cluster, Class II patch 2 (red in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), is located on the opposite side of the Class I cluster, and is better seen after rotating the complex by 180\u00b0 around its vertical axis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The local energy minimum in this cluster is located at about 30 \u00c5 IRMSD from the native state. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a> shows two representative conformations for the Class II patch 2. In addition to the complexes that belong to Class I and the two patches of Class II, there are a number of smaller patches, shown in pink in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>."

We consider the mutations E5C and E32C that are both located outside the specific interaction surface with EIN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and thus the labels do not interfere with the formation of the native complex. Intermolecular <sup>1</sup>H<sub>N</sub>\u2212\u0393<sub>2</sub> rates for the backbone amide protons of U-[<sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]-labeled EIN were measured in the presence of 150 mM NaCl to eliminate potential spurious nonspecific interactions not relevant at physiological ionic strength.

As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, the theoretical profile calculated from the coordinates in the X-ray structure of the native complex (black curve) substantially deviates from the experimental values for a number of residues. For HPr-E5C the largest differences occur at positions 59\u201397 and 160\u2013167 of EIN, with smaller deviations at 23\u201337 and 183\u2013189 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). For HPr-E32C the large differences are at positions 22\u201351, 56\u201374, 96\u2013106, and 160\u2013167 of EIN, with smaller differences at 184\u2013189 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These deviations show that the observed PRE rates cannot be explained well on the basis of the native binding mode of HPr alone, and provide at least qualitative evidence for the existence of lowly populated encounter states in rapid exchange with the final native complex (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tang et al., 2008</a>)."

Therefore we calculate the theoretical PRE profiles based on all 30,000 low energy structures obtained by the docking for each position of the paramagnetic label (blue lines in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The details of the calculation are given in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. We emphasize that these curves are based only on the docked structures, and the native binding mode in the X-ray structure of the complex is not used. The results show that the hypothesis is certainly true for EIN/HPr-E5C, because the full encounter ensemble provides much better approximation than the native complex, particularly for residues 59\u201397 and 160\u2013167 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The correlation coefficient between the experimental PRE rates and the ones based on the encounter complexes is 0.705. In contrast, the correlation coefficients between the experimental PRE rates and the ones back-calculated from the native structure (black line in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) is only 0.47. We note that the agreement improves even for the interface residues in the 67\u201385 region of EIN (indicated by red ticks in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The explanation is that the E5C-EDTA-Mn<sup>2+</sup> label is on the far side of HPr from the interface, and in some encounter complexes this label is much closer to interface residues than in the native complex. For HPr with the E32C-EDTA-Mn<sup>2+</sup> label, accounting for the encounter complexes generated by docking (blue curve in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) improves the correlation coefficient more moderately, from 0.709 to 0.77. This is due to the fact that E32C is close to the edge of the interface in the native complex, already providing a strong PRE signal for residues 67\u201385, resulting in a high correlation coefficient with the experimental PRE values. As will be discussed, since the PRE data are sensitive to small conformational changes and thus are inherently noisy, it is difficult to further improve an already high correlation coefficient. However, even for HPr-E32C, the PRE profile back-calculated from the low energy models still yields better prediction than considering only the native binding mode. Since it is well known that the PRE profiles heavily depend on the location of the paramagnetic tag relative to the native interface (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fawzi et al., 2010</a>), this result does not contradict to our hypothesis that accounting for all structures generated by the docking improves the prediction of PRE rates."

This simplified energy function yields docked structures that have good shape complementarity, but have no favorable electrostatic or chemical interactions. The 30,000 structures with the lowest van der Waals energy from this \u2018shape-complementarity only\u2019 docking were then used for back-calculating theoretical PRE profiles. The results of these calculations, shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, make it absolutely clear that the back-calculated PRE profiles based on the ensemble of structures generated without a proper energy function do not show any resemblance to the observed PRE data. In fact, both correlation coefficients between theoretical and experimental PRE rates are negative, \u22120.36 and \u22120.58, respectively, for the probes at positions E5C and E32C."

The correlation coefficient between the experimental PRE rates and the ones back-calculated from the native structure is 0.58, whereas using the docked structures for the PRE calculation increases the correlation coefficient to 0.78, demonstrating substantially improved prediction. Although some of the improvements occur at the interface residues, it is clearly helpful that the HPr-E5C-EDTA-Mn<sup>2+</sup> label is far from the interface. The distance between the label and a number of IIA<sup>Mannitol</sup> residues is substantially reduced in some of the encounter complexes, which makes the presence of minor species more pronounced.

As in the previous section, we focused on the rigid-body motions of the ligand protein in the space fixed on the receptor protein, although local structural adjustments of the proteins were allowed for more accurate energy calculation. Geometrically the 6D translational/rotational space is the so-called Special Euclidean Group <i>SE(3)</i>, which is the semidirect product of <i>R</i><sup>3</sup> of the translations and <i>SO(3)</i> of the rotations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Park, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Park and Ravani, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mirzaei et al., 2012</a>). Restricting considerations to encounter complexes in which the surfaces of the two proteins touch each other removes the distance of the two proteins as a variable, and the space can be parameterized in terms of 5 angular coordinates. Two angles are needed to define the direction from the center of the receptor to the center of the ligand interface, and the other three angles specify the rotation of the ligand. Although the resulting space is nonlinear and thus the 5 angular coordinates are interdependent, a 5D Euclidean space can be mapped onto this nonlinear space using exponential maps (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shen et al., 2008</a>), and hence we will be able to use analysis tools such as PCA, developed for application in Euclidean space. Further details justifying the need for the use of exponential maps will be given in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. Once an appropriate coordinate system was defined, we selected and densely sampled a region in the neighborhood of the native state to obtain information on the shape of the binding funnel (<a href=\"#bib5\">Camacho et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Selzer and Schreiber, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang and Wade, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Miyashita et al., 2004</a>). Since the apparent properties of the landscape depend both on the energy evaluation model and the method of sampling, to assess the generality of the results we used both PIPER (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kozakov et al., 2006</a>) and the very different docking program RosettaDock (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2003</a>), which is based on Monte Carlo minimization and rebuilds side chain conformations during the search. From each sampling calculation, performed either by PIPER or by RosettaDock, we selected the conformations below a certain energy threshold to delineate the floor of the energy funnel."

For each of these complexes, selected from the protein docking benchmark (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2003</a>), both PIPER and RosettaDock found an energy funnel near the native state. Since this is generally not the case for complexes involving multiple subunits or large conformational changes upon binding, such complexes in the benchmark set were not considered. Structures were retained within 10 \u00c5 IRMSD from the native state. After sampling, the exponential coordinates were normalized to ensure that the variances in the sample set are the same along each coordinate axis, and the shape of the energy landscape over the selected region was studied by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to 5% of conformations with the lowest energy values. As will be emphasized in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, the use of exponential maps, resulting in independent coordinates, is crucial for the success of our study, as only in this case can PCA separate the essential hyperspaces that bound the low energy ensemble."

Each eigenvalue <i>\u03bb</i> <sub>i</sub> can be then interpreted as the percentage of the total variance that is accounted for by the variance along the corresponding eigenvector <b><i>v</i></b><sub>i</sub>. The smallest eigenvalue, <i>\u03bb</i><sub>5</sub>, is less than 5% for almost all complexes (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In many cases both <i>\u03bb</i><sub>5</sub> and <i>\u03bb</i><sub>4</sub> are small (their sum is less than 10%), indicating that the eigenvectors <b><i>v</i></b><sub>4</sub> and <b><i>v</i></b><sub>5</sub> span a \u2018restrictive\u2019 subspace where the low energy structures barely deviate from the native complex. In contrast, <i>\u03bb</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>\u03bb</i><sub>2</sub> typically sum up to more than 75% of variance.

The PDB entry of the complex is 1K74, but we docked the unbound (separately crystallized) RXR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 structures rather than the components from the complex. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> shows the distributions of the same quantities, but based on the low energy structures generated by RosettaDock. The largest eigenvalue, <i>\u03bb</i><sub>1</sub>, is close to 50% for both energy functions. The corresponding movements along <b><i>v</i></b><sub>1</sub> are rotations of helix H12 of PPAR\u03b3 around a hydrophobic patch, formed by the side chains of F432, A433, and L436, which binds to a large hydrophobic pocket of RXR\u03b1 and remains almost at the same position in all low energy encounter complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). As helix H12 rotates, the entire PPAR\u03b3 moves with it until a loop formed by PPAR\u03b3 residues 394 to 403 reaches a favorable position on the surface of RXR\u03b1. We note that hydrophobic patch on helix H12 and the residues connecting it to the rest of the protein (residues 413\u2013433) are known to be essential for forming the heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chan and Wells, 2009</a>). Along the eigenvector <b><i>v</i></b><sub>2</sub> that correspond to the second largest eigenvalue <i>\u03bb</i><sub>2</sub> we can observe how the amino end of helix H12 with the hydrophobic patch on it moves into its binding pocket (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Based on the eigenvalues <i>\u03bb</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>\u03bb</i><sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), over 75% of all movement of PPAR\u03b3 approaching RXR\u03b1 occurs in the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors <b><i>v</i></b><sub>1</sub> and <b><i>v</i></b><sub>2</sub>. Thus, this subspace can be regarded as the essential consensus of a very large number of association trajectories. In contrast to the permissive subspace, changes are very small along <b><i>v</i></b><sub>5</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Since the higher energy structures (not included in the data considered for PCA) can be substantially further from the native state than the ones with low energy, we conclude that the valley based on energy is much narrower than the valley based on geometry."

The PDB entry of the complex is 1R0R. For this pair of proteins, the low energy encounter complexes along the eigenvectors <b><i>v</i></b><sub>4</sub> and <b><i>v</i></b><sub>5</sub> show even narrower distributions than in the previous example, both for PIPER and RosettaDock (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Since the essentially planar inhibitor loop (residues 13 to 19 of OMTKY3) is locked into the crevice at the enzyme\u2019s active site, we expected that the motion along the most permissive direction would be the rigid body rotation of the entire inhibitor, possibly with slight readjustments of the loop. However, we have found that the motion along <b><i>v</i></b><sub>1</sub> is the move of the loop, and particularly the primary specificity residue L18, deeper into the binding pocket of the enzyme (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The rotation along the loop is also present, but along the eigenvector <b><i>v</i></b><sub>2</sub> rather than <b><i>v</i></b><sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Based on the eigenvectors <i>\u03bb</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>\u03bb</i><sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), 81.8% of the movements of OMTKY3 upon binding occurs in the subspace spanned by eigenvectors <b><i>v</i></b><sub>1</sub> and <b><i>v</i></b><sub>2</sub> for this complex. In contrast, the motion along the most restrictive direction <b><i>v</i></b><sub>5</sub> is a very small translation along the bottom of the active site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). It is important to note that, in principle, small eigenvalues identified by PCA could have also occur by chance due to undersampling a subspace. We performed simple Monte Carlo analyses to exclude this possibility (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

This is not surprising, because we specifically selected two docking programs that are very different both in terms of their sampling algorithms and scoring functions (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). PIPER performs systematic rigid body sampling on a dense grid using a \u2018smooth\u2019 potential that allows for some overlaps (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kozakov et al., 2006</a>). In contrast, RosettaDock samples the region of interest using a Monte Carlo minimization algorithm, which biases the search toward low energy regions, and thus the sampling is less exhaustive than the systematic sampling by PIPER. The method periodically rebuilds the complete set of interface side chains, followed by the optimization of the rigid body displacement. The energy is locally minimized in every iteration cycle of a Monte Carlo search algorithm (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2003</a>), and since the clashes are continuously removed, RosettaDock can use an energy function that is more sensitive to small changes in the coordinates than the energy function used in PIPER. Accordingly, Panels A and B of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3 and 4</a> display somewhat different shapes of the energy distributions around the native state placed at the center of the coordinate system. Using rigid structures without local minimization, the minimum of the PIPER energy may be somewhat shifted from the native state, resulting in a more skewed energy landscape than the one obtained with RosettaDock, which generally places the energy minimum closer to the native structure and hence has a more symmetric energy landscape. In view of the differences between the two energy functions we consider it important that the PCA analyses of low energy structures generated by either PIPER or RosettaDock yield similar distributions of the eigenvalues for all 42 complexes. For each complex, both programs result in two small eigenvalues <i>\u03bb</i><sub>5</sub> and <i>\u03bb</i><sub>4</sub>. Although these eigenvalues are generally somewhat smaller for PIPER, because the rigid body approximation leads to a steeper increase in energy as we move away from the minimum along the most restrictive direction, both programs clearly indicate the existence of a restrictive subspace. In addition, Monte Carlo studies, described in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, show that the restrictive subspaces predicted PIPER and RosettaDock are fairly similar. The similarity of these subspaces obtained by two very different energy functions for all 42 complexes indicates that the reduction of dimensionality is an inherent property of protein\u2013protein association. Both programs predict that, on the other end of the spectrum, the two largest eigenvalues, <i>\u03bb</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>\u03bb</i><sub>2</sub>, together exceed 75% of the total variance for most complexes. Thus, in a neighborhood of the native state the encounter complexes are essentially restricted to a two dimensional permissive subspace in the rotational/translational space, and this conclusion is independent of the docking program used."

According to the CAPRI community-wide protein\u2013protein docking experiment, this type of approximation gives good results for a large fraction of complexes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lensink and Wodak, 2013</a>). However, it has been well known that, for most protein pairs, such global search yields low energy structures in several regions of the conformational space, some of which are far from the structure of the native complex. Physics-based energy functions are expected to be globally valid for modeling interactions between proteins, including the non-native states. Thus, one can assume the energy values that are low relative to the average energy but still exceed the energy at the global minimum may lead to the formation of relatively short-lived encounter complexes along the association pathways. As shown in this paper, the agreement between experimental PRE data and theoretical PRE profiles calculated from the ensemble of structures generated by docking confirms this hypothesis, and thus structures of encounter complexes can be obtained simply as byproducts of docking without any further computational expense. While this result is not unexpected, in view of the limited structural information available on encounter complexes it is potentially significant."

                                "text": "To detect intermediate structures in the association of proteins EIN and HPr, paramagnetic labels were introduced at two sites on HPr, one at a time, and the transverse paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) rates, <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub>, of the backbone amide protons (<sup>1</sup>H<sub>N</sub>) of EIN were measured. Since the population of the intermediate structures is generally much lower than the population of the native complex, it is important to discuss why PRE can detect the presence of encounter complexes. The major factor is that the magnitude of the PREs is proportional to &lt; r<sup>\u22126</sup>&gt;, where r is the distance between the nucleus of interest and the paramagnetic center, and &lt;&gt; denotes averaging over the ensemble of structures. Due to the large magnetic moment of an unpaired electron, the effect is detectable for sizeable separations (up to \u223c34 \u00c5 for Mn<sup>2+</sup>). A hypothetical example can be used to explain why the method can detect states with very low populations. We consider an ensemble that includes a major species A with the population, <i>p</i><sub><i>A</i></sub>, of 99%, and with a paramagnetic center to proton distance of 30 \u00c5, and a minor species B with the population, p<sub>B</sub>, of 1%, and with a paramagnetic center to proton distance of 8 \u00c5. We calculate <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> for this proton in a two-site exchange system between A and B, where <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> is defined as the difference in the transverse relaxation rates of the paramagnetic and diamagnetic states (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iwahara and Clore, 2006</a>). For a \u223c30-kDa complex, for species A the <sup>1</sup>H-<i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> arising from Mn<sup>2+</sup> is \u223c2 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<i>\u0393</i><sub>2,A</sub>), and for species B it is \u223c5.6 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<i>\u0393</i><sub>2,B</sub>). Considering B as a short-lived encounter complex and A as the native state, and assuming that the system is in the fast exchange regime, the apparent PRE rate, <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub>, is the population weighted average of the <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> rates of the two species, that is, <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>p</i><sub><i>A</i></sub> <i>\u0393</i><sub>2,A</sub> + <i>p</i><sub><i>B</i></sub> <i>\u0393</i><sub>2,B</sub> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iwahara and Clore, 2006</a>). Based on this expression <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> is \u223c30-fold larger than <i>\u0393</i><sub>2,A</sub>, thereby permitting one to both infer the presence of, and obtain some structural information on, the minor species, because the PRE is a highly distance-dependent quantity. Thus, according to this simple explanation, the PREs can clearly capture the footprint of minor species that exchange rapidly with the native complex, in spite of their much lower concentration."

The strong distance dependence of <i>\u0393</i><sub>2</sub> implies that the observed values are sensitive even to small conformational changes that may occur, for example, due to changes in the rotameric state of the EDTA-Mn<sup>2+</sup> paramagnetic probe. Thus, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, the PRE data, while sensitive to the presence of minor species, are also fairly noisy (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In spite of their substantial variance, the data are informative, since PREs generally also occur at residues that are far from the paramagnetic label in the native complex but are getting closer to it in some members of the encounter ensemble, clearly indicating the presence of non-native transition states. As the examples studied in this paper show, the minor species can be better detected if the label is far from the interface. In fact, a label placed close to interface generates a strong PRE signal, and thus the PRE profile back-calculated from the native structure already correlates well with the data. However, accounting for the encounter complex ensemble most likely improves the prediction even in such cases, but the improvement is generally smaller than the one with the paramagnetic label placed far from the interface."

Dimensionality reduction is caused by interaction forces that are non-specific and thus do not lead to binding at a specific site, but keep the macromolecules in proximity for a prolonged time, allowing an extensive search of the surface along certain directions while restraining the search along others (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ubbink, 2009</a>). This is clearly the case for DNA, whose negative charge attracts positively charged proteins without providing a specific interaction site (<a href=\"#bib21\">Iwahara et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gorman and Greene, 2008</a>). It is well known that long-range electrostatic interactions can also increase the rates of association of two proteins with net opposite charges or with strong charge dipoles, as the search for the reactive patches is facilitated by dipolar pre-orientation of the proteins upon their approach (<a href=\"#bib35\">Schreiber et al., 2009</a>). Such charge interactions prolong the lifetime of the transition state and increase the fraction of productive complexes, and thus can reduce dimensionality. However, it is frequently assumed that, due to specific charge\u2013charge interactions and their irregular surface, proteins do not have ensembles of orientations having similar energies and thus allowing for search along the surface. We have shown here that this is definitely not the case because the energy landscape of interacting proteins, at least within the 10 \u00c5 IRMSD neighborhood of the native state, always includes a permissive subspace along which the conformation of the complex can substantially change without crossing significant energy barriers. Thus, there is no reason to assume that the interactions are nonspecific in protein-DNA association but are specific when two proteins associate. In fact, for all 42 protein pairs, some of which have strong electrostatic interactions, the energy landscape is smooth funnel in a two dimensional permissive subspace. In all cases this subspace captures at least 75% of the total motion as the two molecules approach the native state. For each of the 42 complexes we also detect a high energy subspace, which reduces the dimensionality of the space available to encounter complexes along the association pathways. Thus, there is much less difference between protein-DNA and protein\u2013protein association than it was previously believed."

First, it is well known that any type of optimization is more efficient along the principal components, as large steps can be taken along the permissive directions. This is particularly the case for second-order methods such as the Newton\u2013Raphson optimization that uses a local quadratic approximation of the energy function to find the next minimum in each iteration (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fletcher, 1981</a>). It is also important that such methods require the inversion of the Hessian matrix of the energy function, and in the case of reduced dimensionality the matrix is nearly singular, leading to numerical difficulties and loss of accuracy. Once such directions are known, the problem can be avoided by regularization methods (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fletcher, 1981</a>). In fact, after developing and testing a medium-range optimization method SDU, which employs quadratic semi-definite underestimation in the 5D angular space with the exponential parameters also used in this work (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shen et al., 2008</a>), we understood that the approach can be made more efficient by accounting for the reduced dimensionality of the search space and adding regularization based on PCA. Another potential use is optimally selecting perturbation vectors using the relative magnitudes of the eigenvalues in biased Monte Carlo methods (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 1996</a>)."

In each MCM cycle, RosettaDock perturbs the position of the ligand by random translations and rotations, followed by adjusting the distance between the ligand and receptor to create a contact. Next, a fast MCM at low resolution optimizes the complex orientation with respect to features that do not depend on the explicit conformations of the side chains. Finally, the side chains are added, and an all-atom optimization locates the local minimum energy conformation. The complete set of interface side chains is repacked every eight cycles, followed by the optimization the rigid body displacement.

Any attempt to parameterize the entire set of three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) rotations by an open subset of Euclidean space (as do Euler angles) will suffer from gimbal lock, the loss of rotational degrees of freedom, due to singularities in the parameter space (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grassia, 1998</a>). Parameterizations that are themselves defined over non-Euclidean spaces (such as the set of unit quaternions embedded in R<sup>4</sup>) may remain singularity-free, and thus avoid gimbal lock. Employing such parameterizations is complicated, however, since the numerical tools such as optimization and PCA assume Euclidean parameterizations; therefore we must either develop new tools whose domains are non-Euclidean, or complicate our systems by imposing explicit constraints, for example, to assure that the quaternions stay on the unit sphere (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grassia, 1998</a>). In this paper we use <i>exponential maps</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Park, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Park and Ravani, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shen et al., 2008</a>) to project an Euclidean space onto the nonlinear rotational space. As an example, the simplest exponential map defines a local one-to-one correspondence between the unit circle, which is a nonlinear space (called the circle group), centered at 0 in the complex plane, and the tangent space at 1, which can be identified with the imaginary line in the complex plane. The exponential map for the circle group is given by <i>it \u2192 e</i><sup><i>it</i></sup>, where <i>i</i> = \u221a(\u22121)<i>, it</i> specifies a point on the tangent line, and the exponential function projects it into the corresponding point of the circle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

Since we all five coordinates are angles, the radius of the sphere is also defined as an angle, and we used 22.5\u00b0 as the radius, which roughly translates into a radius of 10 \u00c5 IRMSD neighborhood for relatively small proteins. After the FFT based sampling using the PIPER program (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kozakov et al., 2006</a>) we selected 5000 structures, uniformly distributed within this sphere. Conformations with more than 10 \u00c5 IRMSD from the native structure were discarded, resulting in about 4000 structures. RosettaDock (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2003</a>) was used to generate 2000 structures within the 10 \u00c5 IRMSD radius. After sampling we normalized the 5D coordinates to ensure that the variances in the sample set are the same along each coordinate axis, replacing each vector (<i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>1</i></sub><i>, \u03c3</i><sub><i>2</i></sub><i>, \u03c9</i><sub><i>1</i></sub><i>, \u03c9</i><sub><i>2</i></sub><i>, \u03c9</i><sub><i>3</i></sub>) with its normalized version (<i>x</i><sub><i>1</i></sub><i>, x</i><sub><i>2</i></sub><i>, x</i><sub><i>3</i></sub><i>, x</i><sub><i>4</i></sub><i>, x</i><sub><i>5</i></sub>).

To perform a rigorous comparison of the results from the two methods we introduce the notations <i>\u03bb</i><sub>1P</sub>, . . . , <i>\u03bb</i><sub>5P</sub> and <i>\u03bb</i><sub>1R</sub>, . . . , <i>\u03bb</i><sub>5R</sub> for the eigenvalues based on the low energy structures generated by, respectively, PIPER and RosettaDock. Both sets of eigenvalues are ordered in descending magnitude, and <b><i>v</i></b><sub>1P</sub>,...,<b><i>v</i></b><sub>5P</sub> and <b><i>v</i></b><sub>1R</sub>,...,<b><i>v</i></b><sub>5R</sub> denote the corresponding eigenvectors. Since our main goal is to show that the restrictive subspace is largely independent of the method used, as a measure of discrepancy we will determine the angle between the restrictive subspace spanned by eigenvectors <b><i>v</i></b><sub>4P</sub> and <b><i>v</i></b><sub>5P</sub> based on PIPER, and the subspace spanned by <b><i>v</i></b><sub>4R</sub> and <b><i>v</i></b><sub>5R</sub> based on RosettaDock.

Accepting that the restrictive subspaces match if they differ by less than 30\u00b0 seems to be a somewhat relaxed condition. However, it is easy to show by Monte Carlo simulations that the probability of such agreement by chance for 37 of the 42 structures is negligibly small. We applied PCA to two sets of 100 random vectors in 5D, calculated the covariance matrix and its eigenvalues, for each set we selected the subspace spanned by eigenvectors corresponding to the two smallest eigenvalues, and finally determined the angle between these two \u2018restrictive\u2019 subspaces. By repeating this calculation 1000 times we could show that the probability of obtaining an angle below 30\u00b0 is p=0.131. Although this is not a very small number, the probability that this occurs for 37 of the 42 complexes is less than 10<sup>\u221222</sup>. Thus, the results overwhelmingly support the claim that the restrictive directions found by two very different methods are similar, and thus the reduction in dimensionality is an inherent property of protein\u2013protein association. Due to the orthogonality of eigenvectors, the same similarity between PIPER and RosettaDock results also applies to the permissive subspaces spanned by the first 3 eigenvectors."

These ensembles were then used to back calculate paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) profiles, which were then compared to those derived from experimental PRE measures by NMR. The results presented show that sampling by docking is consistent with the encounters measured experimentally by PRE. The novelty of this study lies with comparing the docking ensembles with ensembles derived from PRE experiments, and using the agreement with experimentally measured PRE as a means to establish the legitimacy of the docking ensembles as representing encounter complexes. Yet little attention is devoted to the PRE data themselves and how they can be related to docking poses and their energetics. How noisy are these data? How much slack is there in associating a given binding mode with a PRE signal. While this study may be the first time the funnel-like shape for the docking reaction coordinate has (some) experimental support, one should be cautious as the funnel shape is deduced from the docking calculations only. Until we understand the limitations of the PRE data it is hard to tell if they support the funnel shape. If indeed the main conclusion of the paper is that the funnel shape is supported by PRE experiments, then more must be provided about the experimental method, the uncertainty in the experimental data, and the sensitivity of the comparison between the docking results and the experiments."

We have followed the advice, and to demonstrate the importance of the energy function when generating the encounter complexes performed docking calculations using a scoring function without long-range energy terms, i.e., considering only the attractive and repulsive components of the van der Waals energy. This simplified energy function yields docked structures that have good shape complementarity, but have no favorable electrostatic or chemical interactions (fourth paragraph of the Results section entitled \u201cPRE experiments and theoretical PRE profiles based on structure\u201d). The 30,000 structures with the lowest van der Waals energy from this \u201cshape-complementarity only\u201d docking were then used for back-calculating theoretical PRE profiles. The results of these calculations, shown in the new <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, make absolutely clear the PRE rates based on the ensemble of structures generated without a proper energy function do not show any resemblance to the observed PRE data. We also show that the correlation coefficients between the experimental PRE rates and the theoretical PRE profiles based on these docked structures are negative. We think that these control calculations convincingly show the need for using a meaningful physics based energy function in order to predict the observed PRE data."
