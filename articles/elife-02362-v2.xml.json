Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antagonizes BST2 through viral protein u (Vpu), which downregulates BST2 from the cell surface. We report the crystal structure of a protein complex containing Vpu and BST2 cytoplasmic domains and the core of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1). This, together with our biochemical and functional validations, reveals how Vpu hijacks the AP1-dependent membrane trafficking pathways to mistraffick BST2. Vpu mimics a canonical acidic dileucine-sorting motif to bind AP1 in the cytosol, while simultaneously interacting with BST2 in the membrane. These interactions enable Vpu to build on an intrinsic interaction between BST2 and AP1, presumably causing the observed retention of BST2 in juxtanuclear endosomes and stimulating its degradation in lysosomes. The ability of Vpu to hijack AP-dependent trafficking pathways suggests a potential common theme for Vpu-mediated downregulation of host proteins."

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antagonizes BST2 through viral protein u (Vpu), which downregulates BST2 from the cell surface. We report the crystal structure of a protein complex containing Vpu and BST2 cytoplasmic domains and the core of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1). This, together with our biochemical and functional validations, reveals how Vpu hijacks the AP1-dependent membrane trafficking pathways to mistraffick BST2. Vpu mimics a canonical acidic dileucine-sorting motif to bind AP1 in the cytosol, while simultaneously interacting with BST2 in the membrane. These interactions enable Vpu to build on an intrinsic interaction between BST2 and AP1, presumably causing the observed retention of BST2 in juxtanuclear endosomes and stimulating its degradation in lysosomes. The ability of Vpu to hijack AP-dependent trafficking pathways suggests a potential common theme for Vpu-mediated downregulation of host proteins."

Like other \u2018complex\u2019 retroviruses, the HIV-1 genome contains genes that encode various proteins that allow the virus to disrupt the immune response of the host it is attacking. Viral protein u is a protein encoded by HIV-1 (but not HIV-2) that counteracts an antiviral protein called BST2 in the host. BST2, which is part of the host's innate immune response, prevents newly formed viruses from leaving the surface of infected cells. By counteracting BST2, viral protein u allows the virus to spread in the host more efficiently."

Complexes formed by various proteins make sure that the vesicles take their cargo to their correct destinations within the cell. Two adaptor protein complexes\u2014known as AP1 and AP2\u2014are thought to be involved the transport of BST2. However, it is not known how viral protein u stops BST2 from reaching the cell surface, or how it decreases the amount of BST2 in the cell as a whole. Jia et al. show how viral protein u and BST2 jointly interact with AP1. This interaction leads to the mistrafficking and degradation of BST2 and the counteraction of its antiviral activity."

BST2 has a short cytoplasmic tail at the N-terminus followed by a single transmembrane (TM) helix, a long coiled-coil extracellular domain, and a C-terminal glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kupzig et al., 2003</a>). The availability of two membrane anchors connected by a long coiled-coil allows BST2 to efficiently inhibit viral transmission by tethering newly formed virions at the infected cell surface and preventing their release to the surrounding environment (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hinz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Schubert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Yang et al., 2010</a>).

The mechanism by which Vpu antagonizes BST2 appears to be multifaceted, involving both degradation and mistrafficking within the endosomal system. Vpu (about 81 amino acids in most viral isolates) is a transmembrane protein consisting of an N-terminal transmembrane \u03b1-helix, followed by a cytoplasmic domain that is likely to be flexible (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Strebel et al., 1988</a>). Vpu associates with BST2 through an anti-parallel interaction between the transmembrane domains of each protein (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mangeat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Skasko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">McNatt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Vigan and Neil, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kobayashi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Vigan and Neil, 2010</a>). This interaction is species-specific and essential for the antagonism of BST2 by Vpu (<a href=\"#bib52\">McNatt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Skasko et al., 2012</a>). Part of Vpu's activity against BST2 can be explained by the viral hijacking of the \u03b2-TrCP-associated ubiquitin\u2013proteasome degradation pathway (<a href=\"#bib84\">Van Damme et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Douglas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Goffinet et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Iwabu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mangeat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Mitchell et al., 2009</a>). A component of the ESCRT-0 machinery, HRS, has also been suggested to recognize ubiquitinated BST2 and target it for lysosomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Janvier et al., 2011</a>). However, these degradation pathways are only partially responsible for the antagonism of BST2 by Vpu (<a href=\"#bib84\">Van Damme et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Douglas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Iwabu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mangeat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Mitchell et al., 2009</a>). Efficient BST2 downregulation from the cell surface can occur in the absence of BST2 degradation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dube et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Goffinet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Tervo et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, Vpu induces the mistrafficking of BST2 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Douglas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dube et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hauser et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lau et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schmidt et al., 2011</a>), causing the accumulation of BST2 at the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN). Both recycled and newly synthesized BST2 are retained at the TGN, blocking the resupply of BST2 to the plasma membrane and eventually leading to its depletion at the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dube et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lau et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schmidt et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, mutations in the juxta-membrane hinge region of Vpu that interfere with the localization of Vpu to the TGN impair the antagonism of BST2 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dube et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Vigan and Neil, 2011</a>)."

Such pathways regulate the trafficking of cellular membrane proteins by selectively packaging these membrane cargos into clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Canagarajah et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Traub, 2009</a>). The clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes mediate this cargo selection. Two canonical sorting motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of the membrane cargo proteins are recognized by the AP complexes: a tyrosine-based Yxx\u03d5 motif (\u03d5 represents a large hydrophobic residue; x for any amino acid) and an acidic dileucine motif, [E/D]xxxL[L/I]. Five AP complexes exist in the cell and each is responsible for trafficking by distinct routes. For example, AP1 traffics cargo between the TGN and sorting endosomes, while AP2 selects cargo for transport between the plasma membrane and early endosomes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Canagarajah et al., 2013</a>). In the absence of Vpu, the natural trafficking of endogenous BST2 depends on the clathrin-associated pathways, and the involvement of both AP1 and AP2 has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rollason et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Masuyama et al., 2009</a>). An unusual double-tyrosine motif, YxY, in the BST2 cytoplasmic domain (BST2<sub>CD</sub>) is critical for this natural trafficking (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rollason et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Masuyama et al., 2009</a>). In Vpu, a putative clathrin-sorting motif, ExxxLV (ELV), located in the membrane-distal half of the protein's cytoplasmic domain (Vpu<sub>CD</sub>) was shown to be important for BST2 antagonism (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kueck and Neil, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">McNatt et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, Vpu-induced virion release and removal of BST2 from the cell surface are inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of AP180, a protein required for the assembly of the CCV at the lipid membrane (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kueck and Neil, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lau et al., 2011</a>). However, the critical question remains as to whether any AP complexes, and if so which, are hijacked by Vpu for the downregulation of BST2."

Moreover, we determined the crystal structure of a three-component complex containing AP1, the cytoplasmic domain of BST2 (BST2<sub>CD</sub>) and the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu (Vpu<sub>CD</sub>). The structure shows that Vpu mimics a membrane cargo by occupying the acidic dileucine-binding site of AP1, while BST2 is bound at the tyrosine-binding site of AP1. This, together with biochemical and functional evidence, suggests that HIV-1 Vpu is a virally encoded modulator of clathrin-dependent trafficking pathways and supports the involvement of AP1 in the Vpu-mediated mistrafficking of BST2."

BST2<sub>CD</sub> contains a putative tyrosine motif that is believed to bind to the \u03bc subunits of AP complexes, and intracellular interactions between BST2 and the \u03bc subunits of either AP1 or AP2 have been reported (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rollason et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Masuyama et al., 2009</a>). We tested interactions between BST2<sub>CD</sub> and the C-terminal domains (CTD) of the \u03bc subunits of three AP complexes (AP1, AP2, and AP3). The purified \u03bc1-CTD of AP1 bound BST2<sub>CD</sub> as the two co-migrated as a higher molecular weight complex on a size exclusion column (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In contrast, no such binding was observed for either the \u03bc2-CTD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) or \u03bc3-CTD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These observations were further confirmed by a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Consistent with the in vitro binding assay, BST2<sub>CD</sub> exhibited binding to \u03bc1, but not \u03bc2 or \u03bc3, in the Y2H assay. As controls, the TGN38 peptide containing a canonical Yxx\u03a6 motif displayed binding to all three \u03bc subunits, and a mutant \u03bc1 subunit (\u03bc1 D174A) with a disrupted binding pocket for tyrosine-based motifs bound neither TGN38 nor the BST2<sub>CD</sub>. Furthermore, this binding was abolished by the double alanine mutation of the YxY motif (Y6/8A) in BST2<sub>CD</sub>. These results indicate that BST2<sub>CD</sub> not only contains a tyrosine-based motif to allow for AP binding, but also a specificity determinant to select specifically for \u03bc1."

As the functionally active ELV motif in Vpu<sub>CD</sub> is a putative acidic dileucine sorting signal, we hypothesized that Vpu binds AP1 at the acidic dileucine-binding site located at the \u03b3 and \u03c31 subunits. To test this, we created a truncated AP1 core with the \u03bc1-CTD removed. Such a truncation construct (AP1t) mimics the open conformation of AP1, exposing the dileucine binding site on AP1 for interaction with cargo (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). We co-expressed Vpu<sub>CD</sub> with casein kinase II (CKII) to phosphorylate Vpu<sub>CD</sub> at S52 and S56 to mimic its cellular state (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Unless mentioned otherwise, doubly phosphorylated Vpu constructs were used in all in vitro studies. Indeed, MBP-Vpu<sub>CD</sub> co-migrated with the \u03bc1-truncated AP1 as a complex on a size exclusion column (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Importantly, the binding was abolished by the alanine-mutation of the ELV motif, signifying the crucial role of the ELV motif in the interaction between Vpu and AP1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We further tested the binding between Vpu<sub>CD</sub> and \u03bc1-CTD and observed complex formation using size exclusion chromatography (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

Furthermore, binding between Vpu<sub>CD</sub> and the \u03bc2-CTD of AP2 was also observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), while no such binding was observed between Vpu<sub>CD</sub> and the \u03bc3-CTD of AP3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

We used a fusion of BST2<sub>CD</sub> and Vpu<sub>CD</sub> to mimic in vitro the membrane-assisted binding that occurs in cells. BST2 and Vpu each have a transmembrane (TM) helix through which the two proteins associate. The C-terminus of BST2<sub>CD</sub> and the N-terminus of Vpu<sub>CD</sub> are placed close to each other by the interacting TM helices (<a href=\"#bib78\">Skasko et al., 2012</a>). This facilitates the convenient design of a 10-amino acid fusion linker that mimics the restraints exerted by the TM helices and links the cytoplasmic domains in an appropriate spatial arrangement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The fusion protein exhibited strong binding to the GST-tagged AP1 in the pulldown assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In contrast, although both Vpu<sub>CD</sub> and BST2<sub>CD</sub> interact with AP1 subunits in our size exclusion chromatography assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), their individual interactions with the full AP1 core complex were not observed under stringent pulldown conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

To validate the in vitro observations made with the TM-free BST2<sub>CD</sub>-Vpu<sub>CD</sub> fusion, we designed a TM-containing chimera and performed immunoprecipitation experiments using human cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>).

However, the observed interface differs from the canonical tyrosine peptide (Yxx\u03a6) binding in that the interaction is achieved with an unusual double-tyrosine motif (YxYxx\u03a6) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). Y8 of BST2<sub>CD</sub> forms the canonical interactions with \u03bc1 residues and inserts into the conserved tyrosine-binding pocket on \u03bc1. Unlike the canonical cases in which a leucine or isoleucine residue is found at the Y+3 position, V11 in BST2 only partly fills the corresponding hydrophobic pocket on \u03bc1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This pocket would be better satisfied by a larger hydrophobic residue. This observation is consistent with results from a previous combinatorial screen of tyrosine-based \u00b5-binding sequences: for \u00b51, valine was disfavored at the Y+3 position, whereas leucine was favored (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ohno et al., 1998</a>). The relatively modest interaction mediated by V11 is presumably compensated by Y6, which stabilizes the binding through hydrogen-bonding interactions with N308 and E381 of \u03bc1 and through stacking interactions with \u03bc1 P383 and Y384. Consistent with the notion that Y6, Y8, and V11 each contribute to the overall binding, substitution of any of these single residues with alanine was sufficient to disrupt the interaction between BST2<sub>CD</sub> and \u00b51 as detected using the Y2H assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

An overlay of the BST2<sub>CD</sub>-bound \u03bc1 structure to the \u03bc2 structure shows that \u03bc2 lacks a tyrosine residue, corresponding to \u03bc1 Y384, which provides a stabilizing stacking interaction with BST2 Y6 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In addition, the presence of \u03bc2 Q318, in place of the smaller N308 of \u03bc1, disrupts a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the side chain of BST2 Y6 and potentially causes steric hindrance. In the case of \u03bc3, the structural difference is much more pronounced: severe steric clashes appear to prevent the binding of BST2 Y6 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Overall, these results not only explain a critical feature of Vpu-mediated hijacking of the AP1-dependent CCV pathway for BST2 antagonism, but also serve as the first structural example of a cellular YxY-based sorting signal bound to the \u03bc1 subunit of AP1."

E62 forms a salt bridge with R15 of AP1 \u03b3 subunit, fulfilling the role of the \u2018acidic residue\u2019 within the sorting motif, while L66 and V67 embed into the hydrophobic pocket on AP1 \u03c31 that accommodates the canonical dileucine residues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>).

When the BST2/Vpu-activated AP1 structure was overlaid with the Arf1-activated AP1 structure using the \u03b21 subunits, a twisting of the \u03b3 and \u03c31 subunits was observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), which further exposes the dileucine-binding pocket at the \u03b3/\u03c31 interface in AP1. The conformational change involves a \u223c20\u00b0 rotation of \u03b3/\u03c31 around an axis at the base of \u03b3 where it contacts \u03b21, with the largest C\u03b1 movement of \u223c35 \u00c5 at the tip of \u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Of note, however, the relative positions either between \u03b21 and \u03bc1 or between \u03b3 and \u03c31 are well maintained. As a result of the \u03b3/\u03c31 movement, new interactions occur between the \u03bc1-CTD and the N-terminal portion of \u03b3. This new \u03b3\u2013\u03bc1 interface has a buried surface area of 685 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, and consists of extensive, hydrogen-bonding and salt bridge interactions between the two subunits (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). We further created a double mutation, \u03b3 Q28R and \u03bc1 D319R, to disrupt this new interface and tested its role in the binding of AP1 to BST2/Vpu in the GST pulldown assay. The binding was decreased, indicating that this newly observed \u03b3\u2013\u03bc1 interface is important for the Vpu-mediated manipulation of AP1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This new AP1 conformation supports the recent hypothesis that the AP complexes might be able to access a wider conformational space beyond what has been previously observed in the locked, unlatched, and open states (<a href=\"#bib8\">Canagarajah et al., 2013</a>)."

It also greatly impaired the ability of Vpu to enhance virion release (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Interestingly, the effect of the R44A:L45A mutation on virion release was additive with the S52/56N mutation, which ablates the binding of Vpu to \u03b2-TrCP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,G</a>), despite that both mutations impair the apparent degradation of BST2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). These data are consistent with the proposed role of R44 and I45 in the binding of Vpu to AP1 rather than to \u03b2-TrCP. Indeed, the R44A:L45A mutation did not affect the interaction with \u03b2-TrCP as measured by immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Together, the impaired abilities of Vpu R44A:L45A to bind AP1 and to decrease the steady-state expression of BST2 suggest that AP1 is important for the Vpu-mediated endo-lysosomal degradation of BST2."

The mutation Y6/8A in BST2<sub>CD</sub> markedly impaired the ability of Vpu to promote virion release, supporting a critical role for this trafficking motif in antagonism of BST2 by Vpu. Since the BST2 YxY motif is not likely required for the \u03b2-TrCP-dependent degradation pathway, which functions via ubiquitination, its importance likely comes from its affinity to AP1 and clathrin-dependent pathways. Of note, the Y6/8A mutant was better expressed than wild-type BST2 and restricted virion release more effectively both in the presence and absence of Vpu. Alanine mutation of Vpu ELV also impaired virion release, to a degree similar to that of the S52/56N mutation of the \u03b2-TrCP binding site. Notably, mutation of the ELV sequence in Vpu and the YxY sequence in BST2 increased the steady-state expression of BST2, presumably by inhibiting endo-lysosomal degradation either as it occurs natively or as stimulated by Vpu. This scenario is consistent with our structural and biochemical observations that both BST2 YxY and Vpu ELV motifs interact with AP1, and it further supports the hypothesis that this interaction is part of the endo-lysosomal degradation mechanism that supports Vpu-activity."

This is conceptually similar to the HIV-1 Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation but occurs through different interaction mechanisms with AP1 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In each case, the HIV-1 protein, Nef or Vpu, causes the retention of its cellular target, MHC-I or BST2, at the TGN and eventually leads to lysosomal degradation through late endosomal pathways. Nef builds upon an incomplete tyrosine-based sorting motif in the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain (CD) and promotes a cooperative three-protein interaction involving MHC-I CD, Nef and \u03bc1 of AP1 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Noviello et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Wonderlich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Singh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jia et al., 2012</a>). The binding mode for the three-component complex involving BST2, Vpu and AP1, is different, with no three-protein interface. The complex is instead stabilized by pair-wise binary interactions: BST2 and Vpu bind through the transmembrane regions, BST2<sub>CD</sub> binds the AP1 \u03bc1 subunit, and Vpu<sub>CD</sub> binds the AP1 \u03c31/\u03b3/\u03bc1 subunits (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). This model is consistent with the previous findings that the transmembrane interaction between BST2 and Vpu is of pivotal importance in determining the activity of Vpu against BST2. The BST2/Vpu/AP1 interaction also causes an open conformation of AP1 that has not been observed before. This new AP1 conformation might only be induced by Vpu or alternatively it might exist as a physiologically functional state that Vpu selectively uses to its advantage."

Despite the evidence supporting the involvement of clathrin-associated pathways, neither AP1, 2 or 3 knockdown in 293T cells and HeLa cells nor AP1 \u03b3 knockout in mouse fibroblasts had any apparent effects on the ability of Vpu to antagonize restriction by BST2 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kueck and Neil, 2012</a>), although we previously reported a role for AP2 in the Vpu-mediated surface-downregulation of BST2 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mitchell et al., 2009</a>). Conceivably, the individual roles of a given pathway are obscured by compensation from overlapping parallel pathways, such as the involvement of multiple AP complexes or the monomeric clathrin adaptor HRS. Another possibility is redundancy in the composition of an individual AP complex. A specific subunit of AP could be knocked down or out only to be replaced by a different isoform (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boehm and Bonifacino, 2001</a>). Substitution might also happen between two related subunits from different AP complexes as they have highly conserved structures (<a href=\"#bib37\">Keyel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2010</a>). Another level of complexity might come from the potential for the mechanism of Vpu activity to be at least partly cell-type dependent. For example, BST2 in some cell types appears to be equally vulnerable to \u03b2-TrCP-dependent degradation and to mistrafficking, whereas in others the role of \u03b2-TrCP-dependent degradation is less important, possibly due to lower levels of BST2 expression (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schindler et al., 2010</a>)."

A shared feature of retroviral accessory proteins including Vpu, Nef, Vif, Vpr and Vpx is the presence of long and flexible loops that provide the structural basis for their multifunctional nature (<a href=\"#bib91\">Xue et al., 2012</a>). These unstructured regions can adopt different conformations to facilitate binding to different host target proteins. These regions often harbor motifs mimicking functional host sequences, enabling the virus to hijack the desired host machineries (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kadaveru et al., 2008</a>). The binding of the Vpu ELV motif to AP1 revealed in our structure, as well as that of the di-phosphoserine motif of Vpu to \u03b2-TrCP shown before, serve as two excellent examples of this viral strategy."

However, in the Vpu sequence from the subtype C of the group M HIV-1, the motif is replaced by the consensus sequence ExxxMV, which might or might not be functionally equivalent to the ExxxLV sequence. Interestingly, while subtype B Vpu localizes predominantly within internal membrane compartments, subtype C Vpu is substantially expressed at the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib62\">Pacyniak et al., 2005</a>). In addition to the sequence variation in the ELV region, subtype C Vpu contains another putative acidic dileucine motif in the membrane-proximal region of its CD, mutation of which affected the trafficking of Vpu (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ruiz et al., 2008</a>).

Besides BST2 and CD4, HIV-1 Vpu also modulates the surface expression of two other important immune factors, NTB-A and CD1d (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sandberg et al., 2012</a>). NTB-A is a co-activator for natural killer (NK) cells, and the Vpu induced downregulation of NTB-A enables infected cells to evade lysis by NK cells (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shah et al., 2010</a>). This involves the mistrafficking of NTB-A, which phenotypically resembles Vpu-mediated BST2 mistrafficking (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bolduan et al., 2013</a>). Although degradation is not induced, Vpu causes retention of NTB-A in a perinuclear compartment. Like BST2, the downregulation depends on an interaction between the transmembrane domains of Vpu and NTB-A (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shah et al., 2010</a>). In addition, residues other than the conserved phosphorylated serines in Vpu<sub>CD</sub> are critical (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bolduan et al., 2013</a>). In the case of CD1d, an antigen-presenting molecule in dendritic cells, downregulation by Vpu occurs through interference with the recycling of CD1d in the endosomal compartments (<a href=\"#bib56\">Moll et al., 2010</a>). A critical residue of CD1d, Tyr331 in a canonical sorting motif, is key for both the natural trafficking and the Vpu-mediated CD1d downregulation. Whether CD1d also interacts with Vpu in the transmembrane or other regions remains to be determined. Given the similarities between these systems, we speculate that the modulation of NTB-A and/or CD1d by Vpu may also involve clathrin-dependent trafficking pathways."

One possibility is that the interaction with AP1 allows BST2 that is internalized from the cell surface to recycle to the plasma membrane, where it acts to trap nascent virions. Another possibility derives from the ability of BST2 to induce the activity of the NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cocka and Bates, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Galao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Tokarev et al., 2013</a>); this signaling function could occur from an endosomal compartment that BST2 reaches via AP1-dependent trafficking. Yet another possibility is that BST2 uses AP1 to divert tethered virions to late endosomal compartments in antigen presenting cells, thus facilitating the presentation of viral antigens in the context of class II or class I MHC (<a href=\"#bib57\">Neil et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Miyakawa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Moffat et al., 2013</a>).

These results not only help unravel the perplexing mechanism of Vpu-mediated antagonism of BST2 but also suggest a potentially evolutionarily conserved function of Vpu in antagonizing other host immune targets. This function might be critical in understanding the full capacity of Vpu in promoting the infectivity and pathogenesis of the primate lentiviruses."

The structure reveals that both Vpu and BST2 bind AP1. BST1 binds the tyrosine binding site on the \u03bc1 site of AP1 via an unusual YxYxxV interaction that seems to explain the observed preference for \u03bc1 (vs. \u03bc2 or \u03bc3). Vpu uses an \u201cELV\u201d motif to bind the \u03b3 and \u03c31 subunits of AP1 through a canonical acidic dileucine-type interaction. The R44 and L/I45 residues of Vpu also appear to make an additional contact adjacent to a novel AP1 interface formed between the \u03bc1 and \u03b3 subunits, although this interaction is not well defined by the electron density. The new \u03bc1-\u03b3 interface can form because the AP1 core adopts a more open conformation that has been seen in previous structures. Thus, Vpu provides additional interactions that enable the viral protein to augment an intrinsic interaction between BST2 and AP1, and the interactions apparently function together to help retain BST2 in juxtanuclear endosomes and to stimulate lysosomal degradation. Qualitative in vitro binding and mutational analyses support the importance of the observed interactions for Vpu-BST2-AP1 complex formation in vitro. Presented experiments also support the relevance of these interactions for formation of functional BST2-Vpu-AP1 complexes in cells, although the effects are not dramatic in all cases (e.g., <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A-C</a>), and the analyses are complicated by the fact that Vpu appears to downregulate BST2 through multiple different mechanisms."

The studies presented here support and extend previous observations that: 1) the acidic-dileucine motif in Vpu is essential for trafficking of BST2 for endosomal degradation, 2) this signal works additively with an endocytic recycling motif in BST2 itself, and 3) a role for AP1 is likely, but is difficult to prove definitively owing to potential redundancy/compensation in clathrin transport pathways and to other mechanisms of Vpu action. The studies presented here (and previously), however, fall short of unequivocally demonstrating the role of AP1 in Vpu function. Quantitative analyses of the different Vpu-BST2-AP1 interactions are also lacking, as are experiments that establish a definitive role for the novel interaction between the Vpu(R44/I45) motif and AP1. The current studies are already very strong and informative and the missing experiments may be technically challenging so we have divided them into issues that must be addressed prior to publication vs. issues that would significantly enhance the impact of the paper if they can be addressed."

We have now included such data in the results section (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D-G</a>). We indeed observed that the RL/AA mutation impaired the abilities of Vpu to downregulate the surface level of BST2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) and to promote virion release (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). The RL/AA mutation has an additive effect on top of the S52/56N mutation on virion release (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), supporting the hypothesis that the motifs affect separate pathways for antagonizing BST2. We also thank the reviewers for directing us to the work by Pickering et al, where the phenotypes from naturally occurring mutations on L/I45 support our findings. We have now included this reference in the manuscript."
