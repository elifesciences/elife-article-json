Ensemble measurements and electrophysiological sieving experiments show that the open-diameter of the channel pore is &gt;25 \u00c5, but the exact size and whether the conformational change follows a helix-tilt or barrel-stave model are unclear. Here we report measurements of the distance changes on liposome-reconstituted MscL transmembrane \u03b1-helices, using a \u2018virtual sorting\u2019 single-molecule fluorescence energy transfer. We observed directly that the channel opens via the helix-tilt model and the open pore reaches 2.8 nm in diameter. In addition, based on the measurements, we developed a molecular dynamics model of the channel structure in the open state which confirms our direct observations."

Ensemble measurements and electrophysiological sieving experiments show that the open-diameter of the channel pore is &gt;25 \u00c5, but the exact size and whether the conformational change follows a helix-tilt or barrel-stave model are unclear. Here we report measurements of the distance changes on liposome-reconstituted MscL transmembrane \u03b1-helices, using a \u2018virtual sorting\u2019 single-molecule fluorescence energy transfer. We observed directly that the channel opens via the helix-tilt model and the open pore reaches 2.8 nm in diameter. In addition, based on the measurements, we developed a molecular dynamics model of the channel structure in the open state which confirms our direct observations."

Currently, there exist two predominant models for the opening of MscL: the barrel-stave model and the helix-tilt model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Perozo, 2006</a>). The barrel-stave model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>) involves motion of the transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) with the transmembrane helix 2 (TM2) remaining stationary; the open pore is lined by both TM1 and TM2 and the helices are fairly vertical (where the membrane is horizontal). This model derives primarily from the number of transmembrane helices and the large size of the open pore.

MscL channels were reconstituted in liposomes during smFRET measurements and thus the channels were in their quasi-native environment. In addition, although MscL is a pentamer, we utilized photobleaching to virtually sort out the population of molecules with a single donor and a single acceptor, allowing us to make accurate smFRET measurements. It is the first time that smFRET has been applied to liposome-reconstituted membrane proteins with more than three monomers. We measured movement of three residues on TM1 (M42C, A27C, and I25C; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and three residues on TM2 (Y75C, Q80C and V82C; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), from which we determined not only the translational movements but also the tilting of each helix. We observed the tilting of the helices in a model-free fashion, arguing strongly in favor of the helix-tilt model. In addition, from the movement of the residue (I25C) right at the gating region, we determined directly that the open pore reaches 2.8 nm in diameter. Lastly, we developed a molecular dynamics model of the channel structure in the open state based on the smFRET results, while using the crystal structure of the protein in the closed state as a reference. The model of the open structure satisfies all the distance constraints measured from smFRET experiments. The developed open structure confirmed that the pore size of the fully open channel is 2.8 nm in diameter, achieved via the helix-tilt opening model."

We emphasize that, although smFRET has been applied to study the conformational changes of channels and transporters (<a href=\"#bib14\">Choi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhao et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akyuz et al., 2013</a>), to our knowledge, it is the first time that smFRET has been used with channels reconstituted to liposomes."

This is the expected result because MscL is a homo-pentamer and the labeling of fluorophores is stochastic. The number of photobleaching steps tells the number of fluorophores attached to a channel. Only the traces showing a single photobleaching step in both the donor and acceptor channels, ensuring that only a single donor and/or acceptor fluorophore, were included in the analysis (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Donors were, in most cases, photobleached first, resulting in simultaneous dropping of the fluorescence intensities in both donor and acceptor channels (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Subtraction of the intensities before and after photobleaching gives the intensities of donor (I<sub>D</sub>) and acceptor (I<sub>A</sub>), which are used for the calculation of FRET efficiency. Note that the intensities, I<sub>D</sub> and I<sub>A</sub>, automatically remove the direct excitation of acceptor (i.e., the leakage of acceptor emission in the donor channel). However, the leakage of donor emission in the acceptor channel is still present. To measure this leakage, MscL channels were labeled with donors-only and the leakage coefficient (\u2113) was measured experimentally: \u2113 = I<sub>D</sub><sup>A</sup>/I<sub>D</sub><sup>D</sup> \u2248 0.09, where I<sub>D</sub><sup>A</sup> is the intensity of donor emission in the acceptor channel and I<sub>D</sub><sup>D</sup> is the intensity of donor emission in the donor channel. Furthermore, to determine the actual FRET efficiency, another instrumental correction was made through the correction factor \u03b3, which accounts for the differences in quantum yield and detection efficiency between the donor and the acceptor. It was calculated as the ratio of change in the acceptor intensity, \u0394I<sub>A</sub>, to the change in the donor intensity, \u0394I<sub>D</sub>, upon acceptor photobleaching: from the traces where the acceptor photobleached first (<a href=\"#bib51\">Roy et al., 2008</a>), we estimated the value \u03b3 = \u0394I<sub>A</sub>/\u0394I<sub>D</sub> \u2248 0.89 \u00b1 0.06 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

Here we focus on the mutant M42C for the sake of illustration. For the single photobleaching steps of M42C, 428 and 577 traces, in the absence and presence of LPC, respectively, were analyzed. The corrected FRET efficiencies were calculated and their distribution was then plotted and fitted with Gaussians via maximum likelihood estimates, shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, while the number of Gaussians was determined according to the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akaike, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schwarz, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sugiura, 1978</a>).

However, this assumption is not necessarily true, especially in our situation where liposomes are immobilized and the proteins are responsive to membrane tension. It had been predicted by theories and observed in experiments that immobilization of liposomes (or vesicles) results in significant membrane tension and possibly rupture (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhdanov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chung et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Serro et al., 2012</a>).

With such strong interaction, giant unilamellar vesicles ruptured spontaneously, as has been observed experimentally (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chung et al., 2009</a>). The consequence is that some of the MscL channels switch to the open conformation upon the immobilization of the liposomes. (However, the fraction of open channels might be different for different mutants even if the membrane tension is similar). Therefore, the FRET histogram for the no-LPC sample includes a mixture of closed and open MscL channels. To test this hypothesis, control experiments were performed by increasing the fraction of BPE in the liposomes, guided by a theoretical prediction (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhdanov et al., 2006</a>): if the hypothesis was true, the membrane tension in the liposomes due to immobilization would be higher, more channels would open in the absence of LPC, and therefore the difference between the FRET histograms with and without LPC would be smaller. We varied the fractions of BPE in the liposomes from 2% to 16% and, indeed, observed that the difference between the samples with and without LPC decreases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We quantified the difference by the (unscaled) variance, <math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><mtext>\u0394</mtext><msup><mi>P</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><munderover><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mo>\u2211</mo></mstyle><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></munderover><msup><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>P</mi><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2212</mo><msubsup><mi>P</mi><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2212</mo></msubsup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math>, where <math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>P</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>X</mi></msubsup></mrow></math> is the probability distribution of FRET efficiency, <math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><munderover><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mo>\u2211</mo></mstyle><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></munderover><msubsup><mi>P</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>X</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>. We observed that the variance \u0394P<sup>2</sup> decreased by 98%, from 0.084 to 0.002, when the fraction of BPE in the liposomes increased from 2% to 16%, supporting the hypothesis that the sample without LPC is a mixture of closed and open channels."

In the simple calculation above, the positions of C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atoms for the estimations were used. However, the side chains of the residues and the attached fluorescent probes will add an additional length on the order of 2 nm, resulting in that the chance for R<sub>fc</sub> and R<sub>no</sub> to overlap is even higher. Furthermore, it has been observed that \u226430% of MscL are hexamers, instead of pentamers, in detergents such as n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) used in the current study (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gandhi et al., 2011</a>). This would tend to \u2018smear\u2019 the middle peaks of FRET in the absence of LPC. Therefore, to be consistent and accurate, we always use the highest FRET efficiency (E<sub>nc</sub> and E<sub>no</sub>) for the calculation of distance changes (\u0394R<sub>n</sub>).

To decrease the likelihood of its happening, and to effectively solve the problem, we applied two strategies. First, we used 5% labeled channels together with 95% unlabeled ones for reconstitution in liposomes. As a result, we had 16x lower molar ratio of labeled proteins (pentamers) to lipids than that in the ensemble FRET experiments: 1:4000 vs 1:250 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Corry et al., 2005b</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2010</a>), greatly reducing the likelihood of inter-molecular FRET. We found that adding a mixture of labeled and unlabeled protein helps to obtain no more than one fluorescent channel per liposome while ensuring efficient incorporation of channels into liposomes. In addition, only traces showing a single photobleaching step in both donor and acceptor channels were included in analysis, which helps further removing the FRET between neighboring MscL channels in the analysis. These strategies reduce significantly the likelihood that energy transfer happens between two adjacent channels even in the presence of MscL clustering, simplifying the interpretation of FRET results."

The pentameric MscL channel (light blue), centered at point O, is labeled with two probes (dark blue) on two cysteine residues (specified by residue #), while the other three residues (with the same residue # but on different subunits) remain empty/unlabeled (dashed green). (Here the breaking of symmetry is taken into account in this general case). To emphasize the size and length of the probes, filled green and red circles are used to indicate the actual chromophores. Then the actual chromophores of the labeled probes (green and red circles) and the center of the protein (O) define a pentagon (dotted orange pentagon, with a side length of R) and a circumcircle (black circle, with a diameter of D, or a radius of r = D/2). We call R, D and r apparent distance/diameter/radius because they could be measured/calculated from FRET experiments (with corrections) and they gave the apparent size of the protein (i.e., the protein appears to have a radius of r based on FRET experiments). There is another set of distances, which are more relevant to the protein and to the MD simulations for the structural model. We call this set of distances true values. For example, the true radius of the protein (r<sub>t</sub>) (referring to a specific residue) is defined as the distance between the Ca atom of the residue and the center of protein (O). We note that the exact atom chosen for the definition of the true radius (r<sub>t</sub>) does not matter."

As a result, converting the FRET measurements into a structural model is not straightforward. However, if the size of the probes does not change (i.e., \u0394r<sub>p</sub> = 0) upon channel activation, we then have \u0394r = \u0394r<sub>p</sub> + \u0394r<sub>t</sub> = \u0394r<sub>t</sub> (similarly \u0394D = \u0394D<sub>t</sub>). We believe \u0394r<sub>p</sub> = 0 is a reasonable assumption for the following reasons: (1) no chemical reactions are happening for the probes and thus the structures of the probes do not change before and after channel opening; (2) anisotropy measurements show that the orientation of probes are not constrained significantly. As a result, the change in the apparent distances is the same as the change in the true distances. In other words, the movement of residues (in the radical direction, \u0394r<sub>t</sub>) can be obtained from the FRET measurements, even if the sizes and lengths of probes are nonzero."

We also note that, although the fivefold symmetry is broken due to the binding of one donor and one acceptor per pentamer, the geometric construction will not be affected.

Because of the fivefold symmetry of the MscL channel, \u0394D and \u0394r can be calculated readily according to \u0394D = \u0394R<sub>n</sub>/sin( \u03c0 /5 ) \u2248 2.8 nm, which yields \u0394r = \u0394D/2 \u2248 1.4 nm (for M42C). The \u0394r values of the residues are summarized in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. This value is above 2.5 nm, a lower bound predicted by EPR experiments (<a href=\"#bib44\">Perozo et al., 2002a</a>), but larger than \u0394D obtained from the previous ensemble FRET measurement: \u0394D<sub>M42C</sub> = 2.8 nm (smFRET) vs \u0394D<sub>M42C</sub> = 1.6 nm (ensemble FRET) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Corry et al., 2005b</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2010</a>). We emphasize that the measurements of two more residues (I25C and A27C) in the current study were also reported previously (<a href=\"#bib17\">Corry et al., 2010</a>). Our results are close to the values in their simulations (\u0394D<sub>I25C</sub> = 2.4 vs 2.5 nm; \u0394D<sub>A27C</sub> = 2.5 vs 2.6 nm) but differ significantly from the values measured directly from ensemble FRET experiments (\u0394D<sub>I25C</sub> = 2.4 vs 0.2 nm). It should be noted that ensemble experiments gave inconsistent measurements for \u0394D<sub>I25C</sub> = 0.2 nm and \u0394D<sub>A27C</sub> = 2.9 nm, although the two residues are close. In contrast, smFRET results show that \u0394D<sub>I25C</sub> = 2.4 nm is similar to \u0394D<sub>A27C</sub> = 2.5 nm. This clearly demonstrates the advantage of smFRET."

However, it is noted that a mixture of hexamers and pentamers were observed in certain detergents for EcoMscL (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gandhi et al., 2011</a>) (\u226430% hexamers in DDM). In our experiments, we ran FPLC (Superdex 200 10/300 GL column) for our MscL proteins and used the proteins from a single peak and checked with SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, in the smFRET experiments, we reconstituted the channels into liposomes, different from proteins in detergents where a mixture of hexameric channels and pentameric channels were observed (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gandhi et al., 2011</a>). Third, as the conductance of the mutants (from electrophysiological recordings) used in this study agrees with that of MscL pentamers (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), it is likely that we are reconstituting MscL pentamers into liposomes. Nonetheless, the possibility of having a (small) portion of hexamers in the sample in smFRET experiments could not be excluded completely. To estimate the introduced uncertainties, we investigated quantitatively the effect of the presence of hexamers via numerical simulations and found that the main effect of the presence of hexamers is not the shift of the peak center but the broadening of peak width (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A-B</a>). If the sample was 100% hexamers, the diameters of the protein, as well as the pore size, will be greater by a factor of sin(\u03c0/5)/sin(\u03c0/6)\u22121 \u2248 17.6%. In the presence of 30% hexamers, as observed in (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gandhi et al., 2011</a>), the calculations would be off by about 7.5%."

For example, the presence of the fluorophores might sterically hinder the conformational change of the proteins and prevent them from opening or closing. On the other hand, the steric hindrance might constrain the orientation of fluorophores, affect the relative orientation between the fluorophores and therefore add more errors on the distances converted from FRET efficiencies. In addition, the insertion of fluorophores to the protein might force the channel to be in a state different from the fully closed state, resulting in the distance change measurement is underestimated. However, we would like to emphasize that the expected effect is insignificant for the following reasons. First, if the insertion of fluorophore would result in significant steric hindrance on the protein, it is expected that the labeling is difficult (i.e., it takes much more effort for the fluorophores to be attached due to the steric hindrance). In other words, it is expected that steric hindrance is not significant on the mutants that are labeled well. More importantly, the channels after being labeled with AF488 and AF568 were confirmed to be functional by both ensemble FRET experiments (by observing the shift in the FRET peak) and patch-clamp measurements (by observing the opening of the channels upon application of negative pressure to the patch pipette) as shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and previous publications with the same fluorophores (<a href=\"#bib17\">Corry et al., 2010</a>)."

For this purpose, we performed MD simulation with distance constraints (<a href=\"#bib9\">Br\u00fcnger et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Trabuco et al., 2009</a>) (i.e., a virtual spring, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) using NAMD 2.9 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>). Although similar modeling attempts have been made by <a href=\"#bib17\">Corry et al. (2010)</a> and <a href=\"#bib22\">Deplazes et al. (2012)</a> by using distance changes measured from ensemble FRET, we would like to emphasize that all smFRET measurements were used for the simulation while previously only a selected subset of ensemble data were used (as other data were not consistent with the resultant model) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Corry et al., 2010</a>). For each measured residue, ten virtual springs were placed, five springs between the central carbon atom C<sub>\u03b1</sub> of identical residues (highlighted green in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) from adjacent monomers (red springs in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and five springs between the C<sub>\u03b1</sub> of identical residues from non-adjacent monomers (yellow springs in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The virtual springs were not applied to side chains because the flexibility of side chains likely introduces errors under large forces in the modeling process. The equilibrium lengths of the springs were chosen by adding the distance changes measured from smFRET to the equilibrium distances seen in the closed state, thereby, opening the crystal structure of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> MscL (PDB: 2OAR) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Perozo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Steinbacher et al., 2007</a>). In the simulation, the virtual springs pushed corresponding residues from the distance in the closed state to the equilibrium length in the open state. We note that the uncertainty due to the size of the FRET probes was minimized by focusing on the change of the distances between the closed and open state, rather than absolute distances as discussed in previous section."

The secondary structure restraints prevents some subtle changes in the structure, such as kinks observed previously in the upper part of TM1 in the open model of MscL (<a href=\"#bib22\">Deplazes et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, we limit our discussion of the open model to pore size and helix tilting. The membrane tension, which causes membrane thinning, plays an important role in the MscL opening process (<a href=\"#bib17\">Corry et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Louhivuori et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Deplazes et al., 2012</a>).

We did observe that the membrane near the MscL becomes thinner during the channel opening process to match with the flattening MscL (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), confirming that a thinning membrane, likely caused by tension, matches the open channel better."

                                "text": "We used two independent methods to measure the pore size of MscL in the open state. The first method is to measure the movements of the residues forming the narrowest pore constriction of the channel, that is residues around I25 for <i>E. coli</i> MscL (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Perozo et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2002a</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Corry et al., 2010</a>). However, this method, although straightforward, has its limitations. It is likely that the function of the channel is affected by mutation and labeling of (some of) the residues at the pore region. For example, the activation thresholds (P<sub>a</sub>, defined as the pressure at which the first channel opening was observed [<a href=\"#bib42\">Nomura et al., 2012</a>]) of mutants G22C and I24C are more than double the wild-type thresholds (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and both ensemble and single molecule FRET measurements of these mutants showed no change in the FRET efficiency after adding 25% LPC. The effect of the point mutations near the pore on the electro-physiological properties of the channel can be quantitatively explained by the closed and open structure of MscL as shown in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the residue G22 (A20 in <i>M. tuberculosis</i> MscL) is very close to the pore and is facing the pore. The residue V22 (V22 in <i>M. tuberculosis</i> MscL) is also close to the pore and sandwiched between helix 1 and neighboring helix 1. Mutating these two residues is likely to perturb the channel function. On the other hand, the residue I25 is further from the pore than G22 and I24. The mutation I25C is less likely effect the channel properties. Indeed the I25C mutation does not affect the channel\u2019s gating parameters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). I25 is still close enough to the pore, making it a perfect candidate for measuring pore size. Furthermore, among the three mutated residues shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a>, I25 (green) is the only one facing outward from the channel axis and accessible from the periphery of the protein (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B,D</a>). We were able to determine the movement of residue I25C (<a href=\"#bib17\">Corry et al., 2010</a>); and measured that the residue I25 moves away from the pore center by \u0394r = 1.2 nm, indicating that the pore opens up by \u0394D = 2.4 nm in diameter. Taking into account that the pore diameter in the closed state (\u03a6<sub>close</sub>) is 0.4 nm (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chang et al., 1998</a>), we conclude that the pore size in the open state (\u03a6<sub>open</sub>) is \u03a6<sub>open</sub> = \u03a6<sub>close</sub> + \u0394D = 2.8 nm, which agrees with previously reported values (<a href=\"#bib44\">Perozo et al., 2002a</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Corry et al., 2010</a>)."

This estimate accounts for all residues of the transmembrane domain and therefore is expected to be more accurate than the estimate of the first method. Using this method we estimate that the pore size of the MscL channel in the fully open state is 2.7\u20132.8 nm, which is consistent with the value from the first method, 2.8 nm."

It is the first time that single molecule FRET has been applied to liposome-reconstituted membrane proteins with more than three monomers. We measured the distance changes of multiple residues from the MscL transmembrane \u03b1-helices (TM1 and TM2) during gating of the channel. For the first time, it is observed <i>directly</i> that both transmembrane helices swing away from the pore center, with rotational tilting involved. The results argue clearly in favor of the helix-tilt model. In addition, we developed by means of computational modeling a model of the channel structure in the open state based on the smFRET results and the crystal structure of the protein in the closed state as a reference. This model also confirms the helix-tilt model and yields a pore diameter of 2.8 nm. The smFRET experiments carried out in the present study observe MscL channels dynamics in lipid bilayers (liposomes) and not in detergents, which is a great advantage over crystallography that can result in different oligomeric states like those seen in the tetrameric structure of <i>S. aureus</i> MscL (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). It is possible that the detergent used in purification caused some portion (\u226430%) of the MscL as hexamers, instead of the assumed pentamers. Nevertheless, our conclusion of the helix-tilt opening model is independent of the percentage of hexameric structure. However, the exact value of the open pore diameter would be slightly greater, 3.0 nm (30% hexamers), up to 3.3 nm (100% hexamers), still agreeing with previously reported values (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sukharev et al., 2001b</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Perozo et al., 2002a</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Corry et al., 2010</a>)."

Right before labeling, proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min, followed by purification using PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare). We titrated the pentameric protein-to-fluorophore molar ratio from 1:1 to 1:5 and used the molar ratio of 1:5 for labeling in all the experiments.

The lipids used in all the measurements were a mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc, Alabaster, AL) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-biotinyl (BPE, Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) dissolved in chloroform at a molar ratio of POPC:BPE = 1000:20. BPE was used for immobilization. To incorporate MscL channels into the liposomes, a mixture of unlabeled and labeled MscL proteins (5% labeled) was then reconstituted into the liposomes, at a final volume of 1 ml, with a protein/lipid (molar) ratio of 1:200, resulting in a molar ratio of 1:4000 for the labeled proteins to lipids. The liposomes were immobilized onto a glass coverslip. This immobilization was achieved by biotin-avidin linkages between biotinylated-PEG molecules on the surface to a neutravidin molecule, and then biotinylated lipids (BPE) in the liposomes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Roy et al., 2008</a>)."

The smFRET measurements permitted the authors to estimate the change in the distance between donors and acceptors from the closed to open states. To quantitatively investigate in detail how the MscL channel opens, the authors developed a computational model for the open state, starting from the crystal structure of MscL in the closed state (PDB: 2OAR) employing the measured residue movements. For this purpose, MD simulations with distance constraints were performed. This is an impressive piece of work because it analyzes the channel in a lipid bilayer environment rather than in detergent micelles, and because the authors use photobleaching to ensure that they are studying channels with one donor and one acceptor, thus avoiding complications that might otherwise undermine the analysis. The importance of the work arises because there is no crystal structure for an open form of these channels, and so the paper potentially fills in major gaps in understanding."

As a result, converting the FRET measurements into a structural model is not straightforward.

We believe \u0394<i>r</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> = 0 is a reasonable assumption for the following reasons: (1) no chemical reactions are happening for the probes and thus the structures of the probes do not change before and after channel opening; (2) anisotropy measurements show that the orientation of probes are not constrained significantly. As a result, the change in the apparent distances is the same as the change in the true distances. In other words, the movement of residues in the radical direction (\u0394<i>r</i><sub><i>t</i></sub>) can be obtained from the FRET measurements, even if the sizes and lengths of probes are nonzero."

Also, the steric hindrance might constrain the orientation of fluorophores, affect the relative orientation between the fluorophores and therefore add more errors on the distances converted from FRET efficiencies. In addition, the insertion of fluorophores to the protein might force the channel to be in a state different from the fully closed state, resulting in the measured distance change being underestimated."

In other words, it is expected that steric hindrance is not significant on the mutants that are labeled well.

I23 is still relatively close to the pore compared to the rest of the residues in MscL, making it a perfect candidate for measuring pore size.
