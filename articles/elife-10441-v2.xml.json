Amines are also potent odors, with some activating olfactory trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Here, we report that teleost TAARs evolved a new way to recognize amines in a non-classical orientation. Chemical screens de-orphaned eleven zebrafish TAARs, with agonists including serotonin, histamine, tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, putrescine, and agmatine. Receptors from different clades contact ligands through aspartates on transmembrane \u03b1-helices III (canonical Asp<sup>3.32</sup>) or V (non-canonical Asp<sup>5.42</sup>), and diamine receptors contain both aspartates. Non-classical monoamine recognition evolved in two steps: an ancestral TAAR acquired Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, gaining diamine sensitivity, and subsequently lost Asp<sup>3.32</sup>. Through this transformation, the fish olfactory system dramatically expanded its capacity to detect amines, ecologically significant aquatic odors. The evolution of a second, alternative solution for amine detection by olfactory receptors highlights the tremendous structural versatility intrinsic to GPCRs."

Amines are also potent odors, with some activating olfactory trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Here, we report that teleost TAARs evolved a new way to recognize amines in a non-classical orientation. Chemical screens de-orphaned eleven zebrafish TAARs, with agonists including serotonin, histamine, tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, putrescine, and agmatine. Receptors from different clades contact ligands through aspartates on transmembrane \u03b1-helices III (canonical Asp<sup>3.32</sup>) or V (non-canonical Asp<sup>5.42</sup>), and diamine receptors contain both aspartates. Non-classical monoamine recognition evolved in two steps: an ancestral TAAR acquired Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, gaining diamine sensitivity, and subsequently lost Asp<sup>3.32</sup>. Through this transformation, the fish olfactory system dramatically expanded its capacity to detect amines, ecologically significant aquatic odors. The evolution of a second, alternative solution for amine detection by olfactory receptors highlights the tremendous structural versatility intrinsic to GPCRs."

These molecules, which include the human hormones adrenaline and histamine, have important roles in regulating the biology and behaviour of many animals. Some biogenic amines bind to receptor proteins called GPCRs on the surface of cells. Many drugs can affect the activity of GPCRs, so understanding how different GPCRs work is an important goal of the pharmaceutical industry. Like all proteins, GPCRs are made of chains of molecules called amino acids. The GPCRs that can detect biogenic amines use a particular amino acid named Asp<sup>3.32</sup>, and when this amino acid is mutated, these GPCRs become unable to bind to their target amine."

The \u03b2<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor is the closest homolog (33% amino acid identity) of TAAR13c for which an active-state structure is currently available. The homology model of TAAR13c indicated a canonical fold of seven transmembrane \u03b1-helices with ligand bound at the core. Using the homology model, we performed computational docking of cadaverine to the orthosteric binding site. One cadaverine amino group of the docked ligand was located near Asp112<sup>3.32</sup>, which corresponds to the highly conserved amine-contact site in biogenic amine receptors. The other cadaverine amino group was positioned at the opposing end of the ligand-binding pocket, 3\u2009\u00c5 away from another aspartate, Asp202<sup>5.42</sup>. The second amino group was also within 5\u2009\u00c5 of side chains from Thr203<sup>5.43</sup> and Ser276<sup>6.55</sup>, Leu192 and Phe194 on extracellular loop 2, and the backbone of Ser199<sup>5.39</sup> (additional nearby residues are depicted in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Zebrafish generally use the same families of olfactory receptors as other vertebrates, including odorant receptors, vomeronasal receptors, and TAARs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kermen et al., 2013</a>). The TAAR repertoire in mice and humans is relatively small, representing 1\u20132% of all main olfactory receptors. However, zebrafish have comparable numbers of TAARs (112) and odorant receptors (143), and expansion of the teleost TAAR family suggests a relatively expanded role for TAARs in fish chemosensation. However, prior to this study, ligands were known for only one fish TAAR\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hussain, et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the vast majority of zebrafish TAARs lack the canonical amine recognition motif, and the classes of ligands they might detect were unknown. Here, we show that almost all zebrafish TAARs (111/112) contain either a canonical amine-detection site on transmembrane \u03b1-helix III (Asp<sup>3.32</sup>), a non-canonical amine-detection site on transmembrane \u03b1-helix V (Asp<sup>5.42</sup>), or both. Thus, teleost TAARs likely represent a very large family of diverse amine receptors."

It seems likely that the massive expansion of this olfactory receptor clade increased the capacity of the fish olfactory system to detect amines, which are water-soluble and ecologically important stimuli for aquatic animals."

The sequence alignment for homology modeling was verified by inspection to confirm proper alignment of sequence landmarks including conserved sequence motifs (DRY/DRH and NPxxY) and transmembrane proline residues. Homology models for TAAR10a (37% amino acid identity) and TAAR16c (30% amino acid identity) were prepared similarly using the same template. Models of receptor point mutants were prepared by side chain substitution in previously prepared homology models and then subjected to energy minimization prior to ligand docking. Docking of ligands into homology models was conducted with the Schr\u00f6dinger suite\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Schrodinger, 2015</a>) using LigPrep version 3.4 and Glide version 6.7. First, the receptor model was prepared for docking by adding protons and assigning charges to ionizable side chains. Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and Asp<sup>5.42</sup> were modeled in the deprotonated state expected at physiological pH. The resulting model was then subjected to energy minimization using the Schr\u00f6dinger <i>impref</i> utility prior to docking. Ligands were docked to the orthosteric binding pocket using Glide Extra Precision (<a href=\"#bib8\">Friesner et al., 2006</a>), and figures were prepared in PyMol (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schrodinger, 2010</a>)."

They cloned 63 TAARs, about half of the TAARs in the species, and tested against a panel of odorants almost exclusively focusing on amines.

The interaction of the positively charged amino group with the aspartate in TM5 differentiates this diamine receptor from most other biogenic amine receptors, whose ligands typically contain a single amino group that is coordinated by the aspartate in TM3. The authors then go through a very nice series of experiments to demonstrate the necessity of D202 for activation by cadaverine (D202A mutant), presumably via coordination of one of the positively-charged amino groups since 3-methoxytyramine can activate D202A at high concentrations. These results support the hypothesis that the canonical Asp<sup>3.32</sup> coordinates the amino groups of monoamine ligands, whereas diamines such as cadaverine can only be accommodated by a second aspartate residue in TM5 (5.42)."

We find that three different clade III TAARs recognize amines (we added new data for a third TAAR in the revision). Importantly, the amine is an essential moiety recognized by TAAR16c and TAAR16f (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Removal of the amine group abolishes responses, indicating that amine recognition is absolutely required for agonism of these TAARs. Moreover, we identified a key amine contact site (Asp<sup>5.42</sup>) that based on modeling and mutagenesis studies is critical for ligand recognition in TAAR13c, TAAR16c, and TAAR16f, and in new data, is sufficient to confer amine recognition upon a mutant HTR6 receptor. This amine contact site is preserved in the vast majority of fish TAARs, and based on all of the data presented; we consider it reasonable to propose that these Asp<sup>5.42</sup>-containing TAARs also detect amines."

The in vivo relevance for ligand-receptor interactions with this level of affinity is highlighted by studies of TAAR4 and TAAR5 knockout mice, which lose behavioral responses to these odors. The EC<sub>50s</sub> for several receptor-ligand interactions reported here are comparable to TAAR4 and TAAR5, including TAAR10a (~500 nM serotonin), TAAR12h (~300 nM 2-phenylethylamine), TAAR13d (1 \u03bcM putrescine), and TAAR13e (1 \u03bcM agmatine).
