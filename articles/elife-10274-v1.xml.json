In social situations, these signals are often ambiguous and can imply different levels of threat for the observer, thereby making their recognition susceptible to contextual cues \u2013 such as gaze direction when judging facial displays of emotion. However, the mechanisms underlying such contextual effects remain poorly understood. By computational modeling of human behavior and electrical brain activity, we demonstrate that gaze direction enhances the perceptual sensitivity to threat-signaling emotions \u2013 anger paired with direct gaze, and fear paired with averted gaze. This effect arises simultaneously in ventral face-selective and dorsal motor cortices at 200 ms following face presentation, dissociates across individuals as a function of anxiety, and does not reflect increased attention to threat-signaling emotions. These findings reveal that threat tunes neural processing in fast, selective, yet attention-independent fashion in sensory and motor systems, for different adaptive purposes."

In social situations, these signals are often ambiguous and can imply different levels of threat for the observer, thereby making their recognition susceptible to contextual cues \u2013 such as gaze direction when judging facial displays of emotion. However, the mechanisms underlying such contextual effects remain poorly understood. By computational modeling of human behavior and electrical brain activity, we demonstrate that gaze direction enhances the perceptual sensitivity to threat-signaling emotions \u2013 anger paired with direct gaze, and fear paired with averted gaze. This effect arises simultaneously in ventral face-selective and dorsal motor cortices at 200 ms following face presentation, dissociates across individuals as a function of anxiety, and does not reflect increased attention to threat-signaling emotions. These findings reveal that threat tunes neural processing in fast, selective, yet attention-independent fashion in sensory and motor systems, for different adaptive purposes."

The accuracy of this decision process is particularly important for the interpretation of negative signals, which require rapid and adaptive responses. In the social domain, identifying the emotional state of a conspecific \u2013 e.g., is he/she angry or afraid? \u2013 rarely depends solely on facial features, which are usually ambiguous and can imply different levels of threat for the observer. Surrounding cues, such as gaze direction and body posture, are known to act as contextual information during emotion recognition (<a href=\"#bib57\">Righart and de Gelder, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barrett and Kensinger, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Aviezer et al., 2011</a>). Specifically, the detection of anger represents an immediate threat for the observer when paired with a direct gaze; by contrast, it is when paired with an averted gaze that fear marks the presence (and possibly the localization) of a threat in the environment (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sander et al., 2007</a>). These threat-signaling combinations of gaze direction and emotion have been shown to be better recognized and rated as more intense than other combinations (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams and Kleck, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Graham and LaBar, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sander et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bindemann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">N\u2019Diaye et al., 2009</a>), and this as a function of anxiety level of the individuals (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ewbank et al., 2010</a>).

In signal detection theoretical terms (<a href=\"#bib30\">Green and Swets, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Macmillan and Creelman, 2004</a>), this effect would correspond to an additive shift of the decision criterion as a function of gaze direction. However, gaze direction could also increase the perceptual <i>sensitivity</i> to the facial features diagnostic of the emotion signaling higher threat. In contrast to the first account, this effect would correspond to a multiplicative boost of threat-signaling cues in the decision process. While the two accounts predict similar effects of gaze direction on the recognition of threat-signaling emotions, a bias effect would be maximal for neutral (emotionless) expressions, whereas a sensitivity effect would be maximal at low emotion strengths (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

The parametric control over emotion strength afforded fitting decision theoretical models to the behavioral and neural data to arbitrate between bias and sensitivity accounts of threat-dependent effects on emotion recognition. At the neural level, previous studies have reported interactions between emotion and gaze direction from 200 ms following face presentation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sato et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">N\u2019Diaye et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Conty et al., 2012</a>), but failed to characterize the computational mechanism responsible for these effects.

Crucially, direction of gaze (direct or averted) was manipulated independently of the displayed emotion in a completely implicit fashion, as it was never mentioned to the subjects nor relevant to the emotion categorization task. Nevertheless, in addition to an expected increase in categorization performance with emotion strength (F <sub>6,138</sub> = 187.3, p&lt;0.001), gaze direction strongly interacted with the displayed emotion on performance (F<sub>1,23</sub> = 21.2, p&lt;0.001). Facial displays of anger were better categorized when paired with a direct gaze (<i>t</i><sub>23</sub> = 4.3, p&lt;0.001), whereas expressions of fear were better categorized when paired with an averted gaze (<i>t</i><sub>23</sub> = -3.4, p&lt;0.01;\u00a0 <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). These combinations of gaze and emotion, anger paired with a direct gaze and fear paired with an averted gaze, are associated with higher threat for the observer (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sander et al., 2007</a>), albeit of different natures. In the case of anger, gaze direction indicates the target of the threat, while in the case of fear gaze direction signals its source. Nevertheless, just as the combination of anger with a direct gaze is more threatening/relevant than with an averted gaze, fear is more threatening when paired with an averted gaze than with a direct gaze. These two combinations, anger direct and fear averted, will thus be labeled as THREAT+ combinations as opposed to THREAT\u2212 combinations (i.e., anger paired with averted gaze, and fear paired with direct gaze)."

To test this possibility, we explored whether residual fluctuations in single-trial EEG signals unexplained by variations in emotion strength (measured by the previous regressions) modulated the accuracy of the subsequent categorical decision \u2013 i.e., the perceptual sensitivity to the displayed emotion. This approach is reminiscent of \u2018choice probability\u2019 measures applied in electrophysiology to measure correlations between neural activity and choice behavior (<a href=\"#bib14\">Britten et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Parker and Newsome, 1998</a>) \u2013 by estimating how much fluctuations in recorded neural signals are \u2018read out\u2019 by the subsequent decision (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wyart et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2015</a>).

Here, we assessed whether the enhanced neural processing of threat-signaling emotions in temporal and motor regions co-varied with the level of anxiety in our participants. For this purpose, we measured anxiety at the beginning of the experimental session, before data collection, using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Spielberger et al. 1983</a>).

Although typical social interactions do not require an explicit categorization of the emotion expressed by others, a precise understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in emotion recognition provides important information regarding how the human brain processes socially meaningful signals. And while past work has uncovered the neural correlates of perceptual decisions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Heekeren et al., 2008</a>), only few studies have addressed the issue of how such decisions are formed on the basis of socially relevant stimuli such as facial displays of emotion. As in most perceptual categorization tasks, we manipulated the ambiguity of sensory evidence \u2013 here, using controlled morphs between angry or fearful expressions and neutral ones. But owing to the social nature of our stimuli, we could simultaneously and implicitly manipulate the contextual significance of the displayed emotion in terms of implied threat for the observer, using gaze direction, and apply a model-guided approach to characterize the neural prioritization of threat-signaling information in electrical brain signals."

However, the mechanisms which instantiate the proposed contextual evaluation of emotions as a function of their implied threat for the observer have remained unclear. Gaze direction could either bias the perceived emotion towards its most relevant (threat-signaling) interpretation \u2013 i.e., anger when paired with direct gaze, or fear when paired with averted gaze, or increase the sensitivity to the most relevant emotion. The present study answers directly this issue by showing, both behaviorally (by comparing quantitative fits of the two effects to the behavioral data) and neurally (by regressing brain signals against emotion strength), that the improved recognition accuracy for threat-signaling emotions corresponds to a selective neural enhancement of perceptual sensitivity to these combinations of gaze and emotion."

This centro-parietal positivity has been proposed to encode a \u2018domain-general\u2019 decision variable, as it varies with the strength of sensory evidence for both visual and auditory decisions, independently from the associated response (<a href=\"#bib1\">O\u2019Connell et al., 2012</a>). Here, the same centro-parietal positivity was found to increase with the emotion strength of facial expressions \u2013 which indexes the decision variable in our emotion categorization task. Importantly, the strength of this relationship was enhanced for threat-signaling emotions. This improved neural representation of threatening combinations of gaze and emotion cannot be explained by increased attentional or surprise responses, since the centro-parietal \u2018P3\u2019 potential, previously reported to vary as a function of attentional resources (<a href=\"#bib35\">Johnson, 1988</a>) and surprise (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mars et al., 2008</a>), was not increased in response to threat-signaling emotions.

Disrupting this motor representation using TMS impairs the facial recognition of negative (i.e., potentially threatening) emotions, not positive ones (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balconi and Bortolotti, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2013</a>). Moreover, the perception of natural scenes engages the motor cortex at very early latencies only when the emotional valence of the scene is negative (<a href=\"#bib12\">Borgomaneri et al., 2014</a>). Taken together, these findings support a strong connection between emotion and motor circuits (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gr\u00e8zes et al., 2014</a>) enabling the brain to react swiftly and efficiently to threat signals (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ohman and Mineka, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Frijda, 2009</a>).

The enhanced sensitivity to threat-signaling emotions in face-selective temporal cortex is driven by low-anxious observers, whereas the early enhancement measured in motor cortex is only found in high-anxious observers. The observation that high-anxious individuals encode all negative emotions as equally (and strongly) salient in face-selective regions is consistent with earlier reports of a \u2018hyper-vigilance\u2019 to potentially threatening signals in these individuals (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bishop, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cisler and Koster, 2010</a>), and with their tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as threatening (<a href=\"#bib9\">Beck et al., 1985</a>) \u2013 both associated with amygdala hyperactivity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bishop, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Etkin and Wager, 2007</a>). Nevertheless, our findings reveal that high-anxious individuals are capable of encoding threat signals in a selective fashion in motor cortex. Consistent with the idea of a compensatory mechanism, the distinct neural enhancements of temporal and motor activity found in low- and high-anxious individuals lead to similar behavioral improvements in terms of perceptual sensitivity to threat signals. Together, this pattern of findings suggests that anxiety increases the relative contribution of the motor pathway during the processing of negative social signals, in accordance with the adaptive function of anxiety in detecting efficiently and reacting swiftly to threats in the environment (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bateson et al., 2011</a>). It is worth noting that the present study only involved participants with anxiety scores within the range of the healthy adult population (<a href=\"#bib61\">Spielberger, 1983</a>), leaving open the question as to whether clinically anxious individuals would similarly recruit their motor cortex in response to threatening social stimuli.

We applied both fixed-effects and random-effects statistics previously described in the literature. The fixed-effects comparison assumes all participants to have used the same underlying model to generate their behavior, such that the overall model evidence for a given model is proportional to the product of model evidence for the model for all participants.

The random-effects comparison is more conservative in allowing different participants to use different models to generate their behavior, and aims at inferring the distribution over models that participants draw from (<a href=\"#bib53\">Penny et al., 2010</a>). For this comparison, we computed support for the winning model by the exceedance probability (<i>p</i><sub>exc</sub>), which is the probability that participants were more likely to choose this model to generate behavior over any alternative model."

The pairing between experimental conditions and EEG signals was shuffled pseudo-randomly 1,000 times, and the maximal cluster-level statistics (the sum of t-values across contiguously significant time points at a threshold level of 0.05) were extracted for each shuffle to compute a \u2018null\u2019 distribution of effect size across a time window of [-200,+1000] ms around stimulus presentation, or [-1000,+200] around response onset. For each significant cluster in the original (non-shuffled) data, we computed the proportion of clusters in the null distribution whose statistics exceeded the one obtained for the cluster in question, corresponding to its \u2018cluster-corrected\u2019 p-value. We applied a second bootstrapping method to test for significant shifts in neural encoding latencies between conditions, using the \u2018jackknifing\u2019 procedure described in (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kiesel et al., 2008</a>)."

We computed the maximum log-likelihood of the model in favor of the \u201cnull\u201d hypothesis, which assumes that \u00b5=0 and the model in favor of the \u201ceffect\u201d hypothesis, for which both \u00b5 and \u03c3 can be adjusted freely to the observed data.

This procedure was repeated for the 24 participants for the anxiety-threat correlation in motor areas and showed that the neural effects of two participants fell slightly (&lt; 20%) outside of the cross-validated 95% prediction intervals.

We did not perform such contrasts because the corresponding effects can be mediated indirectly (and trivially) by changes in the stimulus itself \u2013 not in the decision process. For example, both EEG signals and the accuracy of behavioral responses grow with the strength of the emotion displayed by the face stimulus, such that classifying EEG signals with respect to response accuracy could show a significant difference which is merely due to the fact that correct responses were on average associated with stronger emotions \u2013 i.e., by external differences in stimulation. Performing a response classification analysis not confounded with changes in stimulation would have required a \u2018constant stimulus\u2019 condition, e.g., considering emotionless/neutral stimuli in isolation (only 1/15 of all trials in our experimental design). The other approach, which we have followed throughout the manuscript and which allows to analyze all trials, is the regression-based method consisting in studying how trial-by-trial <i>residuals</i> from the regression of stimulus features (here, emotion strength) against EEG signals co-vary with response accuracy. The other advantage of model-based regression analyses, which do take participants\u2019 responses into account and which we underline more explicitly in the revised manuscript, is that they allow not only to assess whether EEG signals co-vary with behavioral responses, but also how they do so: through modulations of perceptual sensitivity and/or bias."
