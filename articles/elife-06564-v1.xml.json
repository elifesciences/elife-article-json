This function is well illustrated in vision, the dominant sensory modality in humans: visual categorization in natural scenes occurs extremely rapidly (<a href=\"#bib47\">Thorpe et al., 1996</a>) and in the near absence of attention (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2002</a>). Yet, visual categorization is extremely challenging. For instance, categorizing a visual stimulus as a face\u2014arguably the most significant visual stimulus for human social ecology\u2014requires to isolate the face from its natural background scene (\u2018figure-ground segregation\u2019, <a href=\"#bib1\">Appelbaum et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Peterson, 2014</a>) and distinguish the face from the wide range of non-face stimuli in the environment which share visual properties with faces. Moreover, a common response (i.e., generalization) should be given to faces appearing under various viewing conditions (i.e., changes of head orientation, size, illumination, etc) and varying greatly in terms of gender, age, expression, ethnic origin, so on. Despite this challenge, human performance at face categorization is impressive (<a href=\"#bib6\">Crouzet et al., 2010</a>), surpassing even the most sophisticated automatic systems (<a href=\"#bib43\">Scheirer et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "Up to now, the ontogeny of face categorization remains largely unknown. Classical studies have reported preference for facelike over non-facelike patterns at birth (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goren et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Johnson and Morton, 1991</a>). At a few months of age, differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) have been found between face stimuli and meaningless patterns (<a href=\"#bib19\">Halit et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kouider et al., 2013</a>) as well as between faces and exemplars of a single object category segmented from its natural background (e.g., toys, <a href=\"#bib7\">de Haan and Nelson, 1999</a>; cars, <a href=\"#bib34\">Peykarjou and Hoehl, 2013</a>; houses or cars, Gliga and Dehaene, 2007). However, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of infant vision in segmenting faces in natural images and representing them as a distinct, generalized category, or on the developing neural systems that may achieve this process. Clarifying this issue is also important for understanding the origin of hemispheric lateralization for face-selective processes in the human brain. In human adults, areas of the ventral and lateral occipito-temporal cortex are more active when viewing faces vs a variety of non-face objects (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sergent et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Puce et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kanwisher et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haxby et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40a\">Rossion et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2013</a>). This face-selective activation is typically larger in the right than the left hemisphere and, in right handed individuals at least, right unilateral brain lesions can lead to selective impairment in face recognition (prosopagnosia: e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Barton et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Busigny et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hecaen and Angelergues, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sergent and Signoret, 1992</a>). According to a recent hypothesis, this right hemispheric dominance for face perception, which seems specific to humans (e.g., <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsao et al., 2008</a>), is driven by the left hemispheric lateralization for words emerging during reading acquisition (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dundas et al., 2013</a>). Thus, according to this view, right hemispheric lateralization for faces should not be present in infancy. Up to now, infant ERP studies have not been able to provide evidence for right hemispheric lateralization of face-selective processes (<a href=\"#bib7\">de Haan and Nelson, 1999</a>; Gliga et al., 2007; <a href=\"#bib34\">Peykarjou and Hoehl, 2013</a>) and right hemispheric lateralization has only been observed when comparing faces to meaningless stimuli that differ in terms of low-level visual cues (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kouider et al., 2013</a>)."

This approach is ideal to study the infant brain because it is relatively immune from artifacts and provides high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) responses in a few minutes only. Moreover, compared to other approaches such as ERPs to transient stimulation, the FPVS approach is objective and predictive because the response appears exactly at the periodic frequency of stimulation defined by the experimenter. So far, infants have been tested with this approach only in response to low-level visual stimuli (i.e., acuity, contrast sensitivity, spatial phase, orientation, or motion; e.g., <a href=\"#bib3\">Braddick et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Norcia et al., 1990</a>). A recent EEG study tested infants with segmented faces and objects in different stimulation streams, but without testing face vs object discrimination or generalization across diverse face views, and without providing evidence of hemispheric lateralization (<a href=\"#bib14\">Farzin et al., 2012</a>). Here, to achieve these goals, we isolated face-selective responses by means of a fast periodic oddball paradigm (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heinrich et al., 2009</a>) recently adapted to characterize adults' individual face discrimination (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</a>) and face-selective responses in adults (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rossion et al., 2015</a>)."

On grand-averaged data, this high SNR response at 6 Hz (averaged SNR = 8.87 at channel Oz) focused over the medial occipital cortex, reflecting infants' visual system synchronization to the stimulus presentation rate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

To ensure that this effect was not driven by the data of a few infants, a t-test against 1 (i.e., signal above noise level) was also performed using the individual SNR values at Oz (range: 0.19\u201317.07; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This response was highly significant (t(14) = 7.075, p &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, the high frequency resolution of the approach provides many frequency bins to estimate the noise so that the Z-score procedure could be applied to each individual infant's data. At electrode Oz, a significant response was observed in every infant tested but one (Z-score range of 14 infants: 6.10\u201335.46; not significant for 1 infant only).

Moreover, although the faces and objects are relatively well centered, the color images are embedded in their natural and diverse backgrounds. Hence, to be identified as distinct shapes, both the face and object stimuli have to be segmented from their background, a nontrivial accomplishment for the visual system (<a href=\"#bib1\">Appelbaum et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Peterson, 2014</a>). Moreover, both the objects and faces substantially vary in size, color, lighting, and viewpoint, and the faces also vary in gender, age, ethnical origin, and expression. Thus, to generate a periodic discriminative 1.2 Hz response in the EEG, the infant brain has to categorize the face stimuli, namely to produce a response that is specific to face images and invariant to their differences (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rossion et al., 2015</a>)."

In both experiments, faces are temporally embedded in a rapid stimulation sequence of non-face objects, so that there is an inherent comparison, or contrast, without the need to perform a subtraction between conditions recorded at different times. That is, there is an oddball response only because the face is discriminated from all other object categories, activating a (face-)specific population of neurons at a rate of 1.2 Hz. Although this is unlikely, we cannot formally exclude at this stage that another visual category than faces would be represented by a distinct population of neurons and would therefore also elicit an oddball response of this amplitude at 4\u20136 months of age. However, to our knowledge, there is no other visual category that elicits such a large specific response, with a right hemisphere advantage, in the human adult brain. Moreover, the face is arguably the most frequent and socially relevant stimulus in the human (infant) visual environment, making it the best candidate for the early development of category-selective responses."

Despite the great interest of these studies, it is fair to say that it is difficult to define sensitive (i.e., high SNR) and objective face-selective responses in infants with a conventional stimulation mode as used in these studies, so that there is a lack of consistency across studies. Moreover, given time constraints, these studies used segmented stimuli rather than natural images, and could only compare faces to a limited number of categories. Hence, the face-selective responses obtained in previous studies could be due to systematic differences between categories in terms of a homogenous stimulus, such as contour for instance (e.g., all round faces vs rectangular pictures of cars). Finally, a significant contribution of low-level visual cues to faces vs objects responses could not be excluded from these studies, or precisely evaluated."

In other words, the 1.2 Hz face-selective response identified here for natural face images cannot be attributed to low-level visual confounds, such as differences in power spectrum between faces and other object categories. Moreover, the face stimuli were always embedded within distinct natural backgrounds, suggesting that the infant's brain is able to perform complex figure-ground segregation. This is even more impressive considering the brief presentation duration of each face stimulus (i.e., 167 ms SOA, about 100 ms for stimulus duration above 20% contrast, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and the rapid mode of stimulation where each stimulus interrupts the processing of the previous one. Considering the enormous amount of resources devoted to develop face segmentation algorithms in computer vision (<a href=\"#bib43\">Scheirer et al., 2014</a>), this is not a trivial accomplishment."

This observation refutes the view that the right hemispheric lateralization for faces arises only after a few years of age, following and being driven by the left hemispheric lateralization for words that emerges during reading acquisition (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dundas et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2014</a>). Rather, even if literacy can refine cortical organization for vision and language (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dehaene et al., 2010</a>), the right hemispheric face-selective response identified here in young infants indicates that the right lateralization for face perception is present well before reading acquisition (see also <a href=\"#bib10\">Dehaene et al., 2010</a> for right hemisphere lateralization in illiterate adults, and <a href=\"#bib5\">Cantlon et al., 2011</a> for right lateralization in 4 years old children). Instead, our findings are in agreement with an early emergence of right lateralization for faces during development (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Schonen and Mathivet, 1990</a>), a view so far based on evidence collected with face stimuli only (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Schonen and Mathivet, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Le Grand et al., 2003</a>) or by comparing faces to meaningless stimuli that also differ in terms of low-level visual cues (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kouider et al., 2013</a>)."

Some authors have suggested a face-processing module pre-specified in the genome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Farah et al., 2000</a>), compatible with newborns' preferential looking behavior for face patterns at birth (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goren et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Johnson and Morton, 1991</a>; but see; <a href=\"#bib49\">Turati et al., 2002</a>). However, infants are already extensively exposed to faces after a few months of life. Hence, face-selective responses observed here in 4\u20136 month-old infants may originate from a combination of initial biological constraints and of accumulation of visual experience with faces during early development. Neuroimaging studies in children show that the magnitude of face-selective neural responses is not adult-like at 7 years of age and keeps increasing until adolescence (<a href=\"#bib16\">Golarai et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Scherf et al., 2007</a>), suggesting that face-selectivity continues to increase during development. Given its advantages in terms of sensitivity, implicit recording and objectivity (i.e., measuring brain responses at a known, exact rate of periodic stimulation), the FPVS approach used here with electroencephalography is well positioned to test this hypothesis and characterize the full human developmental course of face processing and natural visual scene categorization."

Three infants paid fully attention only to one sequence and were therefore excluded from the study. Thus, the final sample consisted of 15 healthy full-term 4- to 6-month-old infants (10 males, mean age = 155 days, SE = 6 days). Note that a rejection rate of 4 datasets out of 19 is extremely low compared to typical EEG studies run with infants of that age, requiring much longer testing durations and a data rejection rate of at least 50% (e.g., <a href=\"#bib7\">de Haan and Nelson, 1999</a>)."

This base stimulation frequency rate was selected because it elicits large periodic brain responses to faces in adults (<a href=\"#bib35\">Alonso-Prieto et al., 2013</a>). The stimulation cycle of each image presentation therefore lasted 166.66 ms (1000 ms/6) and started with a uniform grey background. A sinusoidal contrast modulation was used because it generates fewer harmonics (i.e., responses at exact multiple of the stimulation frequency, reflecting the nonlinearity of the brain response; <a href=\"#bib37\">Regan, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Norcia et al., 2015</a>) and because it is a smoother visual stimulation than a squarewave stimulation mode. Full contrast was reached midway through each cycle, that is, at 83.33 ms from cycle onset. Each sequence was composed of 4 objects (O) followed, every fifth stimulus, by a face (F), all randomly selected from their respective category (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Given this design, the face (F) stimulus was presented at the oddball frequency of 6 Hz/5 = 1.2 Hz and could be directly identified in the EEG spectrum as the signature of infants' face categorization response. Each trial lasted 20 s and was flanked by a 2-s fade-in and a 2-s fade-out, at the beginning and at the end of the sequence, respectively. This linear increase/decrease of contrast modulation depth at the beginning and end of each stimulation sequence was used to avoid abrupt onset and offset of the stimuli, which could elicit eye movements."

Electrode offset was reduced to between \u00b125 microvolts for each individual electrode by injecting the electrode with saline gel. Eye movements were monitored with a webcam fixed on the computer screen. The experimenter manually launched each sequence when the infant looked at the back-lit screen. If the infant did not look at the screen, the experimenter would attract his/her gaze towards it in between the stimulation sequences by means of her voice or of a ringing colored toy. During the experiment, triggers were sent from the stimulation computer through a parallel port to the recording computer at the start of each trial and at the minima of each stimulation cycle (grey background, 0% contrast) for the object (O) stimulus and the oddball face (F) stimulus."

EEG sequences could be removed because of (1) a technical problem during recording; (2) an electrode went off during recording; or (3) because the infant did not fixate for the majority of the 20 s. Additionally, the sequence was removed if the SNR was below 2 for the base rate frequency at all medial occipital electrodes Oz, O1, and O2. These criteria led to 1 to 5 sequences excluded per infant. As long as an infant performed one stimulation sequence satisfying these criteria, his/her data was considered into the analyses. EEG data were first filtered with a low cut-off value of 0.1 Hz and high cut-off value of 100 Hz using a FFT band-pass filter. They were then downsampled to 250 Hz to reduce file size and data processing time, and segmented in order to include 2 s of recording before and after each trial. The 28-s long sequences (i.e., 2-s baseline + 2-s fade-in + 20-s sequence + 2-s fade-out + 2-s baseline) were further examined in the time domain for possible channel artifacts. Only one electrode interpolation per infant had to be applied on the sequences of 3 infants only. A common average reference computation was applied to all channels."

Sequences were then averaged in the time-domain for each infant separately and examined for their amplitude spectra at all channels, which led to the exclusion of 8 noisy sequences over the whole group of infants. This preprocessed dataset is available in the public domain (<a href=\"#bib8\">de Heering and Rossion, 2013</a>). A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was then applied to the data for examination in the EEG frequency-domain at the high frequency resolution of 0.05 Hz (=1/20 s). Grand-averaged spectra were computed by averaging the EEG spectra of all individual infants tested. SNR was computed for each individual spectrum as the ratio between the amplitude at each frequency and the average of the 20 surrounding bins (10 on each side, excluding the immediate adjacent bin) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</a>). On grand-averaged data, Z-Scores were computed at 6 Hz and 1.2 Hz as the difference between amplitude at the frequency of interest and the mean amplitude of 20 surrounding bins divided by the standard deviation of the 20 surrounding bins (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</a>). Given that the hypothesis is that the signal is above the noise, the threshold of significance was placed at a one-tailed Z-score of 1.64 (p &lt; 0.05). In Experiment 1, a test at all 32 electrodes on grand-averaged data was performed and a bonferroni corrected p-value of p &lt; 0.00156 (0.05/32) was considered to isolate the significant channels. Five channels reached significance (Table in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). To ensure that an effect was not due to a small subset of infants, <i>t</i>-tests against noise level (i.e., SNR = 1) were performed using individual infants' SNR values at the frequencies of interest."

However, the current organization of the Results section causes the reader to constantly switch back and forth between statistics for grand-averaged data and for individual infant data.

In addition, we are in a position to run a statistical test in each individual infant using an estimation of the noise across 20 bins surrounding the frequency bin of interest. We have modified the Results section to make this clear, describing results on grand-averaged data in a different paragraph than the analysis based on individual infants.
