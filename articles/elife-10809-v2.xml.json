Here, we identify a novel host cell effector export pathway that requires the Golgi-resident aspartyl protease 5 (ASP5). We demonstrate that ASP5 cleaves a highly constrained amino acid motif that has similarity to the PEXEL-motif of <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites. We show that ASP5 matures substrates at both the N- and C-terminal ends of proteins and also controls trafficking of effectors without this motif. Furthermore, ASP5 controls establishment of the nanotubular network and is required for the efficient recruitment of host mitochondria to the vacuole. Assessment of host gene expression reveals that the ASP5-dependent pathway influences thousands of the transcriptional changes that <i>Toxoplasma</i> imparts on its host cell. All these changes result in attenuation of virulence of \u0394<i>asp5</i> tachyzoites in vivo. This work characterizes the first identified machinery required for export of <i>Toxoplasma</i> effectors into the infected host cell."

Here, we identify a novel host cell effector export pathway that requires the Golgi-resident aspartyl protease 5 (ASP5). We demonstrate that ASP5 cleaves a highly constrained amino acid motif that has similarity to the PEXEL-motif of <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites. We show that ASP5 matures substrates at both the N- and C-terminal ends of proteins and also controls trafficking of effectors without this motif. Furthermore, ASP5 controls establishment of the nanotubular network and is required for the efficient recruitment of host mitochondria to the vacuole. Assessment of host gene expression reveals that the ASP5-dependent pathway influences thousands of the transcriptional changes that <i>Toxoplasma</i> imparts on its host cell. All these changes result in attenuation of virulence of \u0394<i>asp5</i> tachyzoites in vivo. This work characterizes the first identified machinery required for export of <i>Toxoplasma</i> effectors into the infected host cell."

Other parasite processes and host pathways now known to be impacted by the GRA proteins include: a skewing of the immune response through the effector GRA24 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Braun et al., 2013</a>), influencing nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells nuclear translocation in some strains via GRA15 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rosowski et al., 2011</a>), transport of small molecules across the PVM via GRA17 and GRA23 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gold et al., 2015</a>), generation of the nanotubular network (NTN, thought to aid nutrient acquisition [<a href=\"#bib43\">Mercier, 2002</a>]) via GRA2 (and others) as well as recruitment of the host mitochondria to the PVM through the dense granule protein mitochondrial association factor 1 (MAF1) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pernas et al., 2014</a>).

In the related malaria-causing parasites, <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., some of the mechanisms of protein export into the host erythrocyte have been revealed. Protein export by <i>P. falciparum</i> occurs almost immediately after invasion (<a href=\"#bib50\">Riglar et al., 2013</a>), and cargo proteins traffic via the parasite\u2019s secretory pathway through the ER to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and across the PVM into the host cell (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wickham, 2001</a>). In the majority of cases, a conserved pentameric motif, RxLxE/Q/D, referred to as the <i>Plasmodium</i> export element (PEXEL) or vacuolar transport signal (VTS), is required for export to the host cell (<a href=\"#bib41\">Marti, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">Hiller, 2004</a>). In all published cases involving <i>Plasmodium</i> proteins, the PEXEL resides ~15\u201330 amino acids after the signal peptide (SP), where it acts as a proteolytic cleavage site (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boddey et al., 2009</a>) for the ER-resident aspartyl protease plasmepsin V (PMV) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boddey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Russo et al., 2010</a>). PEXEL processing occurs after the leucine (RxL<sup>\u2193</sup>xE/Q/D), which reveals a new N-terminus that is acetylated in the ER (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boddey et al., 2009</a>). The current hypothesis is that the exposed new N-terminus (<sup>Ac-</sup>xE/Q/D) permits cargo selection for targeting to a parasite translocon located at the PVM, known as PTEX (for <i>Plasmodium</i> translocon of exported proteins) (<a href=\"#bib14\">de Koning-Ward et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Elsworth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Beck et al., 2014</a>).

Within the N-terminus of GRA16 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bougdour et al., 2013</a>), we observed a PEXEL-like motif (RRLAE) after the SP, at amino acid positions 63 to 67 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To determine whether the PEXEL-like motif was involved in protein trafficking in <i>Toxoplasma</i>, we undertook a mutational analysis of GRA16 at the endogenous locus. This was achieved through double-homologous recombination whereby the endogenous <i>GRA16</i> gene was replaced with either wild-type\u00a0(WT)\u00a0<i>gra16</i> encoding the native PEXEL-like motif RRLAE and fused to a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag (GRA16<sub>WT</sub>-HA), or a version of <i>gra16</i> with its PEXEL-like motif mutated from RRLAE to AAAAE (GRA16<sub>AAAAE</sub>-HA). The resulting lines were analyzed for proteolytic processing and trafficking. Immunoblot analysis showed that GRA16<sub>WT</sub>-HA is represented by a strong signal at ~57\u2009kDa and two minor species at approximately 60\u2009kDa and 54\u2009kDa,\u00a0respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Following mutation of the PEXEL-like motif (GRA16<sub>AAAAE</sub>-HA), the two lower molecular weight species were not observed, demonstrating that the mutated protein was no longer processed in the same way. The result is consistent with the slowest migrating species representing signal peptidase-cleaved GRA16, while the size shift of the dominant ~57\u2009kDa species is consistent with cleavage of the PEXEL-like motif located ~45 residues beyond the SP. Interestingly, while both proteins were expressed from the endogenous locus, the amount of GRA16<sub>AAAAE</sub>-HA protein was dramatically reduced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggesting the mutant protein was degraded in the absence of appropriate N-terminal processing. These results are consistent with the PEXEL-like motif being a proteolytic cleavage site similar to that observed in <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boddey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Russo et al., 2010</a>)."

Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with parasites expressing GRA16<sub>WT</sub>-HA and GRA16<sub>AAAAE</sub>-HA for 24\u2009hr and the localization of the proteins was determined by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-HA antibodies. GRA16<sub>WT</sub>-HA was observed within the host cell nucleus, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bougdour et al., 2013</a>), as well as at the PV and within parasites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C-i</a>). In contrast, GRA16<sub>AAAAE</sub>-HA was observed either within parasites, in small punctate structures reminiscent of the Golgi or in the PV space between parasites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C-ii</a>). In a minority of cells, a small amount of exported GRA16<sub>AAAAE</sub>-HA could be observed within the host nuclei (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C-ii</a>, panel 2); however, there was a large and clear defect in export in the mutant line. Taken together, this demonstrates that the PEXEL-like motif is required for correct proteolytic processing of GRA16 and efficient export to the host cell. We therefore termed this motif the <i>Toxoplasma</i> export element (TEXEL)."

PfPMV-HA behaved as expected (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boddey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">2013</a>), cleaving peptides containing the WT KAHRP PEXEL but not P<sub>3</sub> (R&gt;K) or P<sub>1</sub> (L&gt;I) point mutations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-i</a>). This <i>Plasmodium</i> enzyme also cleaved the peptide containing the WT GRA16 TEXEL, with notably higher efficiency than it cleaved the peptide KAHRP; however, it did not cleave GRA16 peptides containing TEXEL mutations at P<sub>3</sub> (R&gt;A) or P<sub>1</sub> (L&gt;A), as expected based on the known specificity of this protease (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-i</a>). Similarly, ASP5 cleaved the GRA16 TEXEL peptide but did not cleave peptides containing mutations of the TEXEL, P<sub>3</sub> (R&gt;A) or P<sub>1</sub> (L&gt;A), demonstrating that the P<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>1</sub> positions of the substrate (i.e. arginine and leucine, respectively) are important for ASP5 activity, as is the case for PMV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-ii</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boddey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Russo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sleebs et al., 2014b</a>). In contrast to PMV, ASP5 did not cleave KAHRP peptides above background levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-ii</a>). Replacement of the P<sub>2</sub> residue in the KAHRP PEXEL (threonine) with the corresponding residue in GRA16 (arginine) (i.e. P<sub>2</sub>\u2009T&gt;R) resulted in a 3-fold increase in cleavage, demonstrating the importance of the P<sub>2</sub> position for ASP5 activity, although cleavage of this peptide was still well below that seen for the native GRA16 TEXEL peptide (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-ii</a>). This demonstrates that while ASP5 and PMV both cleave peptides containing RxL sequences, they do not share identical substrate specificity. To further investigate the specificity of ASP5, point mutations were introduced at different positions of the GRA16 TEXEL substrate. This demonstrated that ASP5 does not well tolerate conservative and non-conservative changes at the P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub> or P<sub>3</sub> positions. It appeared that ASP5 could cleave RKL at ~35\u201340% of WT, yet the physiological relevance of this is not known (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

The model shows that the guanidyl side-chain of arginine at P<sub>3</sub> (the first position in the TEXEL sequence) forms interactions with the side-chains of E506 and Q549 in a manner completely analogous to that observed in the structure of PMV in complex with the statine inhibitor, WEHI-842 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hodder et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-i</a>). Furthermore, the leucine at P<sub>1</sub> of the TEXEL is surrounded by hydrophobic residues I429, Y503, F546 and I554 of ASP5; the isoleucine at position 554 in ASP5 is a valine in PMV, while the other residues, I, Y, F are identical between ASP5 and PMV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-i</a>). Our TEXEL cleavage data described above revealed that, unlike PMV, arginine is strongly preferred at the P<sub>2</sub> position for ASP5 activity and that this <i>Toxoplasma</i> enzyme could not efficiently process the PEXEL motif from KAHRP, which contains threonine at P<sub>2</sub>. This was supported using our model, as the AutoDock potential predicted that ASP5 binds the GRA16 peptide (SRRLAEE) 5 kJ/mol more tightly than an SR<b>T</b>LAEE mutant form of GRA16 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-ii</a>). In this mutant substrate, the side-chain guanidine of arginine at P<sub>3</sub> is still clamped by the side-chain carboxylate and amide of ASP5 residues E506 and Q549, respectively, and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the arginine residue also forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of T677 of ASP5. The backbone carbonyl of leucine at P<sub>1</sub> in the GRA16 TEXEL forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl and the backbone amide of S505. The guanidine side-chain of arginine at P<sub>2</sub> of native GRA16 forms hydrogen bonds with the side-chain hydroxyl of S505 and the backbone carbonyl of A776\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-i</a>), whereas the mutated GRA16 substrate containing threonine at P<sub>2</sub> forms only a single hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl of S505 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-ii</a>). Taken together, these differences in binding interactions accounts for ~50% of the total difference in the calculated binding affinity between the two substrates, providing a clear structural explanation for the substrate specificity (i.e. RRL) observed for ASP5."

Mutation of leucine at P<sub>1</sub> of the GRA16 TEXEL to valine reduces the calculated binding energy by 6 kJ/mol, which is in line with our observations that mutations at this position significantly reduce ASP5 activity. The major source of the reduction in binding energy in the L&gt;V mutation arises from a reduction in electrostatic interaction, similar to that seen for the R&gt;T mutation above. Mutation of alanine at P<sub>1</sub>\u2019 (position 4 of the GRA16 TEXEL, RRLAE) to valine is predicted to slightly increase the binding energy, but by less than 1 kJ/mol. The small change in calculated binding energy is consistent with a lack of sensitivity at this position in the TEXEL sequence recognized by ASP5. Interestingly, mutation of glutamine at P<sub>2</sub>\u2019 (position 5 of the GRA16 TEXEL) to alanine causes an 11 kJ/mol reduction in calculated binding affinity in the model, in contrast to the increase in ASP5 activity observed in vitro (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

It has recently been shown that <i>Toxoplasma</i> tachyzoites, but not the related <i>Neospora</i> species, actively induce expression of host c-Myc following infection (<a href=\"#bib22\">Franco et al., 2014</a>). This activation of c-Myc was not induced in response to parasite invasion or injection of rhoptry proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Franco et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that one or more dense granule proteins may be responsible. To determine whether ASP5 is involved in up-regulation of host c-Myc, HFFs were infected with WT, <i>\u0394asp5</i> or <i>\u0394asp5<sub>CRISPR</sub></i>:ASP5<sub>WT</sub>-HA<sub>3</sub> parasites, and c-Myc expression was measured by IFA and immunoblot. While uninfected HFFs showed little c-Myc expression by IFA, cells infected with WT <i>Toxoplasma</i>, or parasites with complemented ASP5 expression, had almost universal induction of c-Myc in their nuclei, as previously reported (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Franco et al., 2014</a>). Upon infection with <i>\u0394asp5</i> parasites, a sharp reduction in c-Myc expression within the nuclei was observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Quantification by IFA showed that HFFs infected with parasites lacking ASP5 expressed approximately 6.4-fold less c-Myc than those infected with WT parasites (normalized ratio of c-Myc to 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI]) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To confirm this, c-Myc induction was measured by immunoblot of whole cell protein fractions. While c-Myc expression was induced in host cells infected with WT parasites, the signal was dramatically reduced in HFFs infected with the same number of <i>\u0394asp5</i> parasites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), confirming that ASP5 is required for <i>Toxoplasma</i> to induce c-Myc in infected cells. Together, this work suggests that the up-regulation of c-Myc induced by tachyzoites is controlled by one or more ASP5-dependent proteins."

Further analysis of the ~80\u2009kDa bands in the left panel using a 3\u20138% Tris-Acetate gel (right panel) revealed that this is a doublet, where the lower molecular weight species (*) is likely a cross-reactive protein often observed, even in knockout lines of this gene, by Franco et al.\u00a0when using MYR1 antisera, but never when detecting this protein by C-terminal epitope tagging. This strongly suggests that ASP5 is required for cleavage of MYR1.

Given that we determined there is little to no change in replication rates between WT and \u0394<i>asp5</i> parasites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), we harvested all samples 20\u2009hr after\u00a0infection and used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile gene expression in HFFs that were either uninfected (UI), infected with WT (RH<i>\u2206ku80</i>) parasites, or infected with <i>\u0394asp5</i> parasites. To make sure that all the\u00a0changes that we observed were due to loss of ASP5 and not differences in tachyzoites numbers, we first compared the proportion of reads (rpkm) from parasite versus host cell origin as a readout of relative parasite numbers per sample. We saw equal amounts of reads mapping to human genes between all samples (24\u201327 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> reads), while infection with WT saw parasite RNA proportions of 27% (replicate 1), 24% (replicate 2) and 23% (replicate 3). Infection with our ASP5 deficient line saw parasite RNA to be 18% (replicate 1), 35% (replicate 2) and 36% (replicate 3) of the total reads, therefore suggesting that, in 2 out of the 3 samples, we have slightly more ASP5-deficient parasites per sample. Therefore, any loss of gene expression in ASP5-deficient cells must be due to loss of this protease and not lower amounts of overall parasites per sample. The expression changes due to infection by the <i>\u0394asp5</i> parasites were generally smaller than those for the WT parasites. The log-fold change during infection with <i>\u0394asp5</i> parasites was, on average, only 60% of the log-fold change during infection with WT parasites (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A-i</a>). This suggests that most genes responding to parasite infection do so, at least partly, due to an ASP5-dependent pathway. At a false discovery rate of 5%, 3402 genes were significantly up-regulated and 3369 genes were significantly down-regulated in response to the WT infection, whereas only 1033 genes were significantly up- and 817 were significantly down-regulated in response to <i>\u0394asp5</i> parasites. Of the 3402 genes up-regulated during WT infection, only 862 (25% ) remained significantly up-regulated upon deletion of <i>ASP5</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A-ii</a>). Of the 3269 genes down-regulated during WT infection, only 742 (22%) remained significantly down-regulated upon deletion of <i>ASP</i>5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A-ii</a>). This identifies genes (color-coded red and blue in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) that are potentially unaffected by ASP5-dependent pathways."

The dashed line shows x=y. The solid line shows the least squares regression line through the origin. The regression has slope 0.6, showing that log fold changes for the <i>\u0394asp5</i> parasites are only 60% of those for the wild-type parasites. Differentially expressed genes are color coded in the plot according to whether they change in both the WT and <i>\u0394asp5</i> infections or only in the WT (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05).

As expected, the three biological replicates cluster together well for each condition. The plot shows that expression in HFFS infected with <i>\u0394asp5</i> parasites tends to be intermediate between uninfected cells and the WT infection (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>).

We observed that ASP5 controlled the up-regulation of gene sets implicated in cell cycle, nucleic acid metabolism and binding, nucleopore association and chromatin binding. Furthermore, ASP5 played a key role in the down-regulation of genes implicated in autophagy, peroxisome fission, vacuole organization, protein trafficking (i.e. syntaxin binding) and intracellular signaling processes (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This outlines that ASP5-dependent pathways play an important role in controlling specific cellular processes that may facilitate parasite persistence within the cell."

Central to this is the ability to manipulate host cellular pathways using exported effector proteins to circumvent the host response to allow for intracellular parasite growth and survival. Previous work has demonstrated that <i>Toxoplasma</i> effectors can be delivered to the host cell by secretion from the rhoptry organelles (<a href=\"#bib34\">Koshy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Saeij et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boothroyd and Dubremetz, 2008</a>). These effectors largely consist of a family of kinases and appear to be exclusively delivered to the host cell during the short time frame of host cell invasion, potentially limiting their efficacy later during the infection process (<a href=\"#bib60\">Saeij et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Peixoto et al., 2010</a>). While injection of these polymorphic kinases explained some strain variances in virulence, it did not clarify how <i>Toxoplasma</i> induces changes that are more general across isolates. More recently, several new host cell effectors have been identified that appear to be delivered into the host cell via the dense granules\u2014organelles constitutively secreted after\u00a0invasion during intracellular replication (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bougdour et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Braun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pernas et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rosowski et al., 2011</a>).

Our work described here shows that this TEXEL motif is involved in the export of GRA16 into the host cell and is processed by the Golgi-resident ASP5, consistent with a recent publication characterizing ASP5 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Curt-Varesano et al., 2015</a>). While we identified this system based on its similarity to the <i>Plasmodium</i> export pathway, and indeed it has now come to light that several other Apicomplexan species utilize this \u2018PEXEL-like motif\u2019 for protein export (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pell\u00e9 et al., 2015</a>), our work has uncovered important differences between the <i>Toxoplasma</i> and <i>Plasmodium</i> systems and therefore sheds new light on protein export by Apicomplexan parasites."

A small molecule compound that mimics RRL and contains the non-cleavable amino acid statine (WEHI-586), thus a likely competitive inhibitor, inhibited ASP5 activity, whereas WEHI-916, a potent PEXEL-mimetic inhibitor of PMV that contains valine at P<sub>2</sub> (RVL<sub>statine</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sleebs et al., 2014b</a>) was a very poor ASP5 inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt;20 \u03bcM; data not shown). Our structural model of ASP5 in complex with the TEXEL of GRA16 provides a clear explanation for the requirement of RRL within the substrate. Interestingly, we observed that mutation of the P<sub>2\u2019</sub> residue increased ASP5 activity. This likely reflects a reduced entropic penalty associated with forming the salt bridge between the otherwise flexible side-chains. The ASP5 model also revealed differences between it and PMV, including the absence of a helix-turn-helix motif in PMV that is thought to participate in protein\u2013protein interactions in the ER, consistent with ASP5\u2019s location in the Golgi."

We demonstrate that MYR1, a novel protein essential secreted into the PV, has an ASP5-cleaved TEXEL motif approximately 558 amino acids from the predicated signal peptidase cleavage site. Plasmepsin V of <i>Plasmodium spp.</i> is an ER-resident enzyme that cleaves the PEXEL co-translationally (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sleebs et al., 2014b</a>), potentially residing in complex with signal peptidase, thus immediately licensing proteins for export upon ER entry. This cannot occur for ASP5, as it is located in the Golgi, which would require TEXEL-cargo proteins to be trafficked via vesicles to this compartment prior to its activity. It is interesting to note that this localization for ASP5 is not unique as other aspartyl proteases involved in protein trafficking, such as furin and the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE), are located in the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib71\">Thomas, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Evin et al., 2010</a>). It is therefore possible that the positional constraint of the <i>Plasmodium</i> PEXEL within cargo proteins is the consequence of PMV\u2019s ER localization, whereas ASP5\u2019s location in the Golgi may permit cleavage of a TEXEL motif at any position within a substrate protein. It is possible, however, that PMV may also cleave PEXEL motifs found anywhere within <i>Plasmodium</i> proteins containing a signal peptide, as this is yet to be investigated. An important difference between the <i>Plasmodium</i> and <i>Toxoplasma</i> export pathways is that, while PEXEL cleavage appears to be solely involved in export, the apparent lack of export of cleaved MYR1 suggests that TEXEL processing may also be necessary for correct localization and/or function in the PV. We also found that <i>\u0394asp5</i> parasites displayed a profound defect in the biogenesis of the NTN within the PV, which is known to require several PV proteins of dense granule origin. The NTN resides between replicating parasites and the PVM, where it potentially functions in the exchange of solutes by increasing surface area (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mercier, 2002</a>). It is presently unknown whether the genesis of the NTN requires proteins that are exported into the host cell but it is interesting to note that GRA14, a protein known to be involved in NTN formation, has a putative RRLxx motif (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rome et al., 2008</a>)."

Some <i>Plasmodium</i> exported proteins do not have a PEXEL motif and instead rely on a transmembrane domain and other unknown factors for translocation through the PTEX translocon.

By interrogating the biological processes and molecular functions of genes that are influenced by ASP5, it is evident that this protease plays an important role in influencing the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, nucleic acid metabolism, autophagy, peroxisome fusion, vacuole organization, cell differentiation, signaling processes and proteins that bind DNA and chromatin (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). While GRA16 has been implicated in cell cycle progression and GRA24 influences transcription factor expression, there are as yet no known effectors that influence the other characterized biological processes.

Furthermore, profiling the transcriptional changes that occur in other cell types that <i>Toxoplasma</i> is known to infect, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, myocytes and neurons, and the ability to determine the influence of ASP5-dependent pathways on these changes is now imminently achievable."

Our data show that ASP5 is important for many cellular and transcriptional changes to the infected host cell and, therefore, this strongly suggests that collectively these changes, even in the highly virulent RH background, are important for <i>Toxoplasma</i> virulence in vivo."

An evaluation of the binding free energy was carried out using the AutoDock potential (<a href=\"#bib44\">Morris et al., 1998</a>). In its original formulation, the AutoDock potential includes terms that represent the entropic penalty for restriction of conformational freedom and desolvation of the ligand only. Here, we have included these two components for both ligand (wild-type GRA16 and mutations) and receptor (ASP5) and consequently reduced the contribution to the total free energy of interaction of each by half. AMBER all-atom partial atomic charges were used to calculate the electrostatic interaction energy.

HFFs were washed with PBS to remove uninvaded parasites and dislodged with trypsin. Total host and parasite RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Three independent biological replicates of each condition were obtained. DNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq v2 protocol and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF), Melbourne. On average, 25.5 million 100\u00a0bp single-end reads were obtained for each sample. The reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the Rsubread aligner (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liao et al., 2013</a>). The number of fragments overlapping each Entrez gene were counted using featureCounts (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liao et al., 2014</a>) and NCBI RefSeq annotation, build 38.1. Differential expression analyses were performed using the Bioconductor packages edgeR (<a href=\"#bib53\">Robinson et al., 2010</a>) and limma (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ritchie et al., 2015</a>). All genes that did not achieve a count per million of 0.4 in at least 3 samples were deemed to be unexpressed and subsequently filtered from the analysis. Additionally, genes with no official symbol in the NCBI gene information file were removed. Following filtering, 15,018 genes remained for the downstream analysis. Compositional differences between samples were normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values method (<a href=\"#bib53\">Robinson et al., 2010</a>). All counts were then transformed to log2-counts per million (logCPM) with associated precision weights using voom (<a href=\"#bib36\">Law et al., 2014</a>). Differential expression for the three comparisons, WT infected versus uninfected, <i>\u0394asp5</i> infected versus uninfected, and <i>\u0394asp5</i> infected versus WT infected, was assessed using empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics (<a href=\"#bib68\">Smyth, 2004</a>). Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if they attained a false discovery rate of 0.05. Gene ontology analysis used the goana function. Shrunk log2-fold-changes for plotting were computed using edgeR\u2019s predFC function with prior count set to 3. The barcode plot was drawn with limma\u2019s barcodeplot function and the correlation of the <i>\u0394gra16</i> gene sets with the RNA-seq data was evaluated using a directional roast gene set test with 10,000 rotations (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wu et al., 2010</a>).

Overall, your study is well performed, timely, and important.

If ASP5 is required for the secretion of multiple effectors and/or a large number of changes in gene expression in the host, one might expect a dramatic difference in vivo (and the plaque growth phenotype, if confirmed in multiple ASP5 mutants and reverted after complementation, would also predict a significant deficiency in vivo). While RH is not the best system in which to study this, slight alterations in pathogenesis can be detected in the form of reduced time to death and/or reduced morbidity (weight loss, parasite burden). Given that the strains are in hand, it should not be difficult to carry out these experiments."

If ASP5 is required for the secretion of multiple effectors and/or a large number of changes in gene expression in the host, one might expect a dramatic difference in vivo (and the plaque growth phenotype, if confirmed in multiple ASP5 mutants and reverted after complementation, would also predict a significant deficiency in vivo). While RH is not the best system in which to study this, slight alterations in pathogenesis can be detected in the form of reduced time to death and/or reduced morbidity (weight loss, parasite burden). Given that the strains are in hand, it should not be difficult to carry out these experiments.</i> "

Surviving animals were monitored for sero-conversion to <i>T. gondii</i> by Western blot (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In addition to mutating the RR residues in the TEXEL, of GRA16, we have now explored the consequence of mutating the remaining residues, LAE, on binding to ASP5 in the dynamic model. Mutation of leucine to valine (L&gt;V) reduces the calculated binding energy by 6 kJ/mol, in line with this residue playing an important role in processing. However mutation of the fourth TEXEL residue, alanine to valine (A&gt;V) had almost no effect on binding energy in agreement with a lack of sensitivity at this position. Finally, mutation of glutamine at position five of the TEXEL to alanine (E&gt;A) had caused an 11 kJ/mol reduction in binding affinity, in contrast to the increase in ASP5 activity observed in vitro (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). It is possible that the glutamine reside at position 6 (i.e. RRLAEE) can act as a surrogate for the loss of glutamine at position 5 in this interaction. These data have now been discussed in the text (paragraph three, subheading \u201cASP5 modeling reveals key interactions with the TEXEL of GRA16\u201d) and are included in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>.

We furthermore show that we see c-myc induction is lost upon deletion of ASP5.
