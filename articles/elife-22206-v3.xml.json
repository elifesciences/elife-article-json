We now identify novel natural killer (NK) cell evasion functions for four members: US12, US14, US18 and US20. Using a systematic multiplexed proteomics approach to quantify ~1300 cell surface and ~7200 whole cell proteins, we demonstrate that the US12 family selectively targets plasma membrane proteins and plays key roles in regulating NK ligands, adhesion molecules and cytokine receptors. US18 and US20 work in concert to suppress cell surface expression of the critical NKp30 ligand B7-H6 thus inhibiting NK cell activation. The US12 family is therefore identified as a major new hub of immune regulation."

We now identify novel natural killer (NK) cell evasion functions for four members: US12, US14, US18 and US20. Using a systematic multiplexed proteomics approach to quantify ~1300 cell surface and ~7200 whole cell proteins, we demonstrate that the US12 family selectively targets plasma membrane proteins and plays key roles in regulating NK ligands, adhesion molecules and cytokine receptors. US18 and US20 work in concert to suppress cell surface expression of the critical NKp30 ligand B7-H6 thus inhibiting NK cell activation. The US12 family is therefore identified as a major new hub of immune regulation."

Most people will at some point become infected with CMV, yet the virus tends only to cause serious disease in people whose immune system is not working properly. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS and organ transplant recipients (who have to take drugs that suppress their immune system to prevent the organ being rejected) are particularly vulnerable to CMV infections. Critically, the virus can cross the placenta to infect of the foetus. CMV infection in the womb can cause miscarriage, lead to severe developmental problems in babies and is a major cause of deafness."

Natural killer cells are known to play a critical role in detecting and destroying cells infected with CMV. The virus, in turn, has nine genes that help to protect it against natural killer cells. This includes two genes that belong to a group of similar genes called the US12 family, but it is not clear whether other members of this gene family also provide protection against natural killer cells."

For example, two members work together to target a human protein called B7-H6 that acts a sensor to alert natural killer cells if a particular cell is infected. However, the impact of the US12 family goes even wider. The whole family works together to control proteins that are found on the surface of human cells, and many of these proteins appear to be involved in regulating the immune response."

HCMV codes for around of 170 canonical protein-coding genes with 39 herpesvirus \u2018core\u2019 genes concentrated in the center of the U<sub>L</sub> region (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dolan et al., 2004</a>). The core genes mainly encode structural components of the virion and proteins required for virus DNA replication and have orthologues in the other human herpesviruses. The vast majority of the remaining HCMV genes are not essential for virus replication <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dunn et al., 2003</a>) yet are replete with accessory functions, many of which have been implicated in suppressing host immune responses. Unusually, HCMV encodes 15 gene families of variable size that are often clustered on the genome (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davison et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Holzerlandt et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chee et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dolan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Davison et al., 2003</a>). Many of these gene families exhibit homology with cellular genes and are conserved to various extents in other primate CMVs. Consequently, these primate CMV gene families are likely to have arisen through gene capture and amplification driven by differential selective pressures in their various primate hosts over millennia (<a href=\"#bib14\">Davison et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2003</a>)."

The genetic arrangement of the US12 family is reminiscent of \u2018accordion\u2019 gene expansions, which are generated when a cellular or virus resistance function is placed under strong selective pressure (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fil\u00e9e, 2013</a>). Such an expansion was recently exemplified experimentally using a poxvirus interferon resistance function (<a href=\"#bib18\">Elde et al., 2012</a>). The US12 family encodes a series of 7-transmembrane spanning proteins with low-level homology to the cellular transmembrane bax-inhibitor one motif-containing proteins (TMBIM). While not essential for virus replication, the US12 family has been implicated in HCMV tropism, virion maturation and immune evasion (<a href=\"#bib11\">Das and Pellett, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cavaletto et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bronzini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hai et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gurczynski et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fielding et al., 2014</a>)."

We previously observed that US18 and US20 suppress cell surface expression of the NK cell-activating ligand MICA (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fielding et al., 2014</a>) and posited that the synergistic action of US18 and US20 may be the vestige of an immune selective pressure that drove the original expansion of the US12 family. These data show that multiple US12 family members can co-operate to target the same cellular protein. Therefore individual functions, as identified with single gene viral mutants, may not be readily replicated by expressing these same viral genes in isolation, i.e. these viral genes may work more efficiently in the context of HCMV productive infection."

Conventional biochemical investigations on US12 family proteins are rendered problematic due to their extreme hydrophobicity. We therefore undertook multiplexed Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based proteomic analyses to systematically evaluate the capacity of all US12 family genes to modulate the cellular proteome, both individually and in concert. Such an approach has been enabled by our recent development of Plasma Membrane Profiling (PMP) to identify novel cell surface targets for the HCMV latency protein UL138 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Weekes et al., 2013</a>) and individual viral immunevasins UL141 and US2 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hsu et al., 2015</a>).\u00a0Quantitative Temporal Viromics (QTV) allowed\u00a0&gt;8000 cellular and 153 viral proteins to be tracked throughout the course of productive HCMV infection, thus\u00a0building a comprehensive picture of cellular control by the virus (<a href=\"#bib56\">Weekes et al., 2014</a>).\u00a0Through comparative analysis of ~1300 cell surface and\u00a0~7200 cellular proteins during infection with HCMV US12 family deletion mutants, we now describe in detail\u00a0how this family has a profound influence not only on NK cell recognition but other key functions that impact on immunity including cellular adhesion and cytokine signalling."

Significantly increased levels of NK activation were detected in assays using deletion mutants of 5 different US12 family members: US12 (3 of 4 donors), US14 (1 of 4 donors, with a trend towards increased NK activation in the other three donors), US18 (3 of 4 donors), US20 (4 of 4 donors), US21 (4 of 4 donors) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), while three US12 family deletion mutants (US15, US16, US19) reduced the level of NK cell activation in some donors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Although members of the US12 family are capable individually of either activating or suppressing NK cell function, the net effect of the complete US12 gene family is clearly to inhibit NK cell recognition."

The proteomic analyses were performed in two parts to permit inclusion of appropriate controls. Samples analyzed in Proteomic Series 1 included mock-infected controls, the parental HCMV strain, the US12-21 block deletion and defined mutants in US18, US19 and US20 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Mass spectrometry quantified 7215 WCL and 1281 PM proteins. The extremely dynamic modulation of the host cell proteome observed during productive HCMV infection was consistent with previous findings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)(<a href=\"#bib56\">Weekes et al., 2014</a>). The role of the entire US12 gene family was assessed by comparison of the HCMV US12-21 block deletion mutant with its parental virus. The impact was most noticeably focused on the PM, in that the majority of WCL proteins affected were also PM \u2018hits\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The heat map illustrating changes in protein abundance correspondingly appears more dynamic i.e. a higher proportion of proteins detected were regulated in response to the deletion of individual US12 family genes for the PM proteome than for the much larger set of proteins quantified in WCL samples (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For a given PM protein modulated by the US12 gene family (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), comparable results were observed in WCL samples (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), suggesting that the US12 family regulates protein expression or stability of cell surface proteins."

To gain an overview of pathways targeted, the online bioinformatics resource DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualisation and Intergrated Discovery; <a href=\"https://david.ncifcrf.gov/\">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</a>) was used to perform a KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment analysis on proteins rescued\u00a0&gt;3 fold by the deletion of the US12-21 block (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dennis et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2009</a>). Multiple KEGG pathways were significantly enriched (data not shown), including natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (MICA, MICB, ULBP2, IFNGR1), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (IL6ST, KIT, KITLG, ACVRL1, ACVR1, IFNGR1) and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs; JAM3, ICOSLG, PTPRM, MPZL1, CXADR, ALCAM, SDC4, CD99, SDC1). The modulation of cell adhesion molecules and chemokines/cytokines may additionally impact NK cell recognition. A further NK ligand, B7-H6, was not identified by DAVID analysis, but was also regulated by the US12-21 mutant. While MICA is a recognized target of US18 and US20 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fielding et al., 2014</a>), the regulation of the NK cell activating ligands B7H6, MICB and ULBP2 by the US12 family are novel."

To determine the contribution of each individual US12 family member to the overall effects observed with the \u2018block\u2019 deletion mutant, Proteomic Series two compared infection with all the single gene deletion mutants (except the US19 deletion) to the parent HCMV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Mass spectrometry quantified 7156 whole cell and 1312 PM proteins. We re-examined key candidate molecules identified by bioinformatic analysis of the US12-21 block deletion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>). A striking feature of this data was that the majority of these target proteins were regulated by both US18 and US20, with a subset additionally regulated to a lesser degree by US14 and/or US16 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>). Other US12 family members also had important effects, with US12 and US13 mutants regulating the NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) ULBP2 and MICB respectively, US14 mutant regulating PTPRM, and the US15 mutant regulating IL6ST (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Overall, the contribution made by a given family member varied dramatically ranging from the highly focused impact of US13 and US19 (one cellular target each) to the exceptionally promiscuous US20 (54 cellular targets) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Where a given protein was quantified both in PM and WCL samples, generally similar changes were observed in both samples (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). Interestingly, MICA was regulated by the deletion of US12-21 block to a much greater extent than any of the single deletion mutants, implying that multiple US12 family members may need to act in concert to optimize control over certain cellular targets (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

Ectopic expression of US20, and to a lesser extent US18, from adenovirus vectors reduced levels of exogenously expressed B7-H6 detected by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a>). Both PM and WCL expression of B7-H6 was induced by the HCMV US18, US20 and US12-21 deletion mutants but not by the parental virus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), which was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunoblot (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figures 10</a> and <a href=\"#fig12\">12A</a>).

Clusters of US12-related genes can be detected in cytomegaloviruses of New World primates, i.e. Green Monkey and Owl Monkey CMVs, thus the capture and expansion of an ancestral precursor presumably took place over 41 million years ago (<a href=\"#bib14\">Davison et al., 2013</a>). Within Cynomolgus and Rhesus macaques (Old World primates), chimpanzee and human CMVs, the US12 family is maintained as a well conserved contiguous tandem array of 10\u201311 genes located in the same relative position on each genome. Amongst circulating HCMV clinical strains, the US12 family exhibits relatively high levels of sequence conservation and genetic integrity (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sijmons et al., 2015</a>)."

However, the advent of high-resolution multiplexed proteomics is revolutionizing our understanding of how HCMV orchestrates host cell gene expression and evades host defenses (<a href=\"#bib56\">Weekes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hsu et al., 2015</a>). By systematically analyzing a bespoke panel of HCMV deletion mutants, we have discovered that the US12 family selectively targets a broad range of plasma membrane proteins that include, not only NK cell activating ligands, but also T-cell co-stimulatory molecules, cell adhesion molecules, and cytokine/cytokine receptors. The diversity of proteins targeted by many of the US12 family implies a broad strategy of redirecting cell surface receptors. A sizeable proportion of targeted plasma membrane proteins do not accumulate internally, but are degraded in lysosomes, as indicated by rescue with the inhibitor leupeptin. The overlap that exists between US12 gene family targets with those of the KSHV K5 viral E3 ubiquitin ligase (MICA, MICB, B7 family, ALCAM, IFNGR1, PTPRM, EPHA2, CD99, MPZL1/2) could represent convergent evolution and/or targeting of similar cellular pathways (<a href=\"#bib49\">Timms et al., 2013</a>)."

Although the HCMV US21 deletion mutant also scored in functional assays, this could be due to enhanced expression of pUS20 associated with this construct. The NKG2DL MICB and ULBP2 are strongly upregulated during HCMV infection, but fail to reach the cell surface as they are retained in the ER by the NK evasion function gpUL16 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rolle et al., 2003</a>). Our proteomic data reveal that deletion of US12, US13 and US20 leads to increased cell surface and intracellular expression of MICB, ULBP2 and UL16 itself (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). These observations are consistent with US12 family members acting in concert to direct UL16, MICB and ULBP2 towards proteolytic degradation, with leupeptin treatment clearly able to rescue MICB, and this may contribute to the NK evasion properties of US12 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). They also imply that some of the effects of the US12 family could be the result of co-operation with other HCMV genes. There is some precedent for this situation, although not previously on such a wide scale, as co-operation between US2 and UL141 was observed in the proteasomal degradation of some protein targets e.g. CD112 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hsu et al., 2015</a>). None of the US14 targets are recognized NK cell ligands, suggesting that this gene product utilizes a novel NK evasion mechanism."

Previously, B7-H6 expression was shown to be induced by inflammatory stimuli, for example pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial-derived toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (<a href=\"#bib33\">Matta et al., 2013</a>). We show here that B7-H6 expression is induced as a stress protein by HCMV infection (and potentially other virus infections) and that US18 and US20 act together to suppress cell surface expression of B7-H6 in the context of HCMV, thereby inhibiting NK cell activation. US18 and US20 were also able to regulate exogenously expressed B7-H6 when expressed individually. Therefore, they appear to target B7-H6 directly and not cellular pathways leading to the expression of B7-H6. The control of B7-H6 is likely to be of major significance as NKp30 is expressed on \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells (V\u03b42<sup>-</sup>) that are induced during HCMV infection post-transplantation and correlate with control of disease (<a href=\"#bib36\">Merville et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lafarge et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Correia et al., 2011</a>)."

The targeting of multiple proteins by a HCMV immunevasin or co-operation between HCMV gene products is not unprecedented, but was not previously observed on this scale or with this diversity of target proteins (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tomasec et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Prod'homme et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Smith et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hsu et al., 2015</a>).

Briefly, we performed mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap Fusion, and quantified TMT reporter ions from the MS3 scan (<a href=\"#bib34\">McAlister et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ting et al., 2011</a>). Peptides were identified and quantified using a Sequest-based in-house software pipeline. A combined database was searched, consisting of: (a) human Uniprot, (b) Merlin strain HCMV Uniprot and (c) all additional novel HCMV ORFs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</a>). Peptides spectral matches (PSM) were filtered to a 1% peptide false discovery rate (FDR) using linear discriminant analysis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Huttlin et al., 2010</a>). The resulting dataset was further collapsed to a final protein-level FDR of 1%. Protein assembly was guided by principles of parsimony. Where all PSM from a given HCMV protein could be explained either by a canonical gene or novel ORF, the canonical gene was picked in preference. Proteins were quantified by summing TMT reporter ion counts across all matching PSM after filtering based on isolation specificity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pease et al., 2013</a>). Reverse and contaminant proteins were removed, and protein quantitation values were exported for normalization and further analysis in Excel. Where all PSMs from a given HCMV protein could be explained either by a canonical gene or novel ORF, the canonical gene was picked in preference. For five viral proteins that had related novel ORFs (N-terminal extensions of the viral protein), some peptides could either have originated either from the canonical protein or the novel ORF. In these cases, each of the novel ORFs were quantified based only on unique peptides that could only have originated from that ORF. Peptides that could either have originated from the canonical protein or the novel ORF were assigned to the canonical protein. We estimated p values for the ratios of each mutant compared to HCMV Merlin or leupeptin-treated cells infected with HCMV Merlin to HCMV Merlin-infected cells, using Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Significance B values (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cox and Mann, 2008</a>). Hierarchical clustering was performed using centroid linkage with Pearson correlation. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001881\">SCR_001881</a>) was used to determine protein family enrichment amongst KEGG pathways (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2009</a>).

Here Fielding et al. focus on a region of the HCMV genome, termed US21 family (US12-US21). They took a comprehensive mass spectrometry approach to determine which molecules are affected by deleting these viral genes, using single and complete US21 family knockout viruses. The data strongly support the overall conclusion that these molecules affect NK cell activation against virus-infected cells. That the US21 family affects NKG2D ligands is not surprising but they also demonstrate nicely that US18 and US20 affect expression of B7-H6, that is induced upon viral infection with mutants lacking either one of these ORFs. Overall, the manuscript was favorably viewed but the reviewers felt that a number of issues need to be addressed."

Furthermore, a B7-H6 dependent reporter cell line is activated by US18 and US20, as well as US12-21 deletions and this activation can be blocked by B7-H6 antibodies or siRNA. However, given the concerns above, it is quite possible that neither US18 or US20 directly impact B7-H6.

The possibility that the effects seen are indirect consequences of US12 proteins regulating other viral proteins should be acknowledged more explicitly in the text and it should be clearly stated that this is one of the caveats of the current study.</i>"

We do not agree that the US12 family members promote expression/stabilize UL16, since the levels of UL16 actually increase (rather than decrease) during infection with the specific US12 deletion mutants (current <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). These data support a role for the US12 family in promoting lysosomal degradation of UL16. We recently reported a similar co-operation between US2 and UL141 (Hsu et al., 2015 PLoS Pathogens11(<a href=\"#bib4\">4</a>):e1004811) where UL141 retains CD155 in the ER and selectively feeds CD112 to US2 for proteasomal degradation."

We have inserted the following text into the Discussion, \u2018They also imply that some of the effects of the US12 family could be the result of co-operation with other HCMV genes. There is some precedent for this situation as co-operation between US2 and UL141 was observed in the proteasomal degradation of some protein targets e.g. CD112 (Hsu et al., 2015).\u2019"

Using adenoviral expression they demonstrate that B7-H6 activates NK cells. Furthermore, a B7-H6 dependent reporter cell line is activated by US18 and US20, as well as US12-21 deletions and this activation can be blocked by B7-H6 antibodies or siRNA. However, given the concerns above, it is quite possible that neither US18 or US20 directly impact B7-H6. This would be easy to test using the rAd-US18 and rAd-US20 previously described by the same group (Fielding 2014). Therefore, I suggest that an experiment is included that examines whether US18 and US20 affect B7-H6 expression directly upon ectopic expression.</i>"
