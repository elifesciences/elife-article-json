They link homologous DNA strands and have to be faithfully removed for proper DNA segregation and genome integrity. Here, we present the crystal structure of human HJ resolvase GEN1 complexed with DNA at 3.0 \u00c5 resolution. The GEN1 core is similar to other Rad2/XPG nucleases. However, unlike other members of the superfamily, GEN1 contains a chromodomain as an additional DNA interaction site. Chromodomains are known for their chromatin-targeting function in chromatin remodelers and histone(de)acetylases but they have not previously been found in nucleases. The GEN1 chromodomain directly contacts DNA and its truncation severely hampers GEN1\u2019s catalytic activity. Structure-guided mutations in vitro and in vivo in yeast validated our mechanistic findings. Our study provides the missing structure in the Rad2/XPG family and insights how a well-conserved nuclease core acquires versatility in recognizing diverse substrates for DNA repair and maintenance."

They link homologous DNA strands and have to be faithfully removed for proper DNA segregation and genome integrity. Here, we present the crystal structure of human HJ resolvase GEN1 complexed with DNA at 3.0 \u00c5 resolution. The GEN1 core is similar to other Rad2/XPG nucleases. However, unlike other members of the superfamily, GEN1 contains a chromodomain as an additional DNA interaction site. Chromodomains are known for their chromatin-targeting function in chromatin remodelers and histone(de)acetylases but they have not previously been found in nucleases. The GEN1 chromodomain directly contacts DNA and its truncation severely hampers GEN1\u2019s catalytic activity. Structure-guided mutations in vitro and in vivo in yeast validated our mechanistic findings. Our study provides the missing structure in the Rad2/XPG family and insights how a well-conserved nuclease core acquires versatility in recognizing diverse substrates for DNA repair and maintenance."

In mitotic cells, double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by HR using the sister chromatid as a template to restore the information in the complementary double strand. In meiosis, the repair of programmed DSBs by HR and the formation of crossovers are crucial to provide physical linkages between homologs and to segregate homologous chromosomes. Furthermore, HR during meiosis creates sequence diversity in the offspring through the exchange between homologs (<a href=\"#bib62\">Petronczki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sarbajna and West, 2014</a>)."

Faithful removal of HJs is critical to avoid chromosome aberrations (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wechsler et al., 2011</a>) and cells have evolved sophisticated measures to disentangle joint molecules. One basic mechanism is resolution mediated by HJ resolvases that introduce precise symmetrical nicks into the DNA at the branch point. Nicked DNA strands are then rejoined by endogenous ligases leading to fully restored or recombined DNA strands. This mechanism is well studied for bacterial and bacteriophage resolvases such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> RuvC, T7 endonuclease I, T4 endonuclease VII (<a href=\"#bib8\">Benson and West, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lilley and White, 2001</a>). These resolvases operate as dimers and show a large degree of conformational flexibility in substrate recognition and in aligning both active sites for coordinated cleavage. Interestingly, T4 endonuclease VII and RuvC reach into and widen the DNA junction point whereas T7 endonuclease I binds DNA by embracing HJs at the branch point (<a href=\"#bib9\">Biert\u00fcmpfel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">G\u00f3recka et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hadden et al., 2007</a>)."

In contrast, HJ resolution generates crossover and non-crossover arrangements depending on cleavage direction. Several endonucleases such as GEN1, MUS81-EME1, and SLX1-SLX4 have been implicated as HJ resolvases in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Castor et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fekairi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Garner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ip et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Svendsen and Harper, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Svendsen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wyatt et al., 2013</a>).

The Rad2/XPG family has four members with different substrate preferences that function in DNA maintenance (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nishino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Tsutakawa et al., 2014</a>).

C-terminal to the nuclease core is a regulatory region that is diverse in sequence and predicted to be largely unstructured. Although the catalytic cores are well conserved in the superfamily, substrate recognition is highly diverse: XPG/Rad2/ERCC5 recognizes bubble/loop structures during nucleotide-excision repair (NER), FEN1 cleaves flap substrates during Okazaki fragment processing in DNA replication, EXO1 is a 5'-&gt;3' exonuclease that is involved in HR and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and GEN1 recognizes Holliday junctions (<a href=\"#bib34\">Grasby et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ip et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Nishino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Tomlinson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Tsutakawa et al., 2014</a>).

We found that GEN1 does not only have the classical DNA recognition features of Rad2/XPG nucleases, but also contains an additional DNA interaction site mediated by a chromodomain. In the absence of the chromodomain, GEN1\u2019s catalytic activity was severely impaired. This is the first example showing the direct involvement of a chromodomain in a nuclease.

The structure was determined experimentally and refined up to 3.0\u2009\u00c5 resolution with an R<sub>free</sub> of 0.25 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The HJ crystallized bridging between two protein monomers in the asymmetric unit (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The overall structure of GEN1 resembles the shape of a downwards-pointing right hand with a 'thumb' extending out from the 'palm' and the DNA is packed against the ball of the thumb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The palm contains the catalytic core, which is formed by intertwined XPG-N and XPG-I domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A/B</a>, green). They consist of a seven-stranded \u03b2-sheet in the center surrounded by nine helices harboring the conserved active site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B/D</a>, orange). The catalytic residues form a cluster of negatively charged residues (D30, E75, E134, E136, D155, D157, D208) that were originally identified by mutational analysis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ip et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wakasugi et al., 1997</a>) and are conserved in other Rad2/XPG family members (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B/C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The XPG-I domain is followed by a 5'-&gt;3' exonuclease C-terminal domain (EXO; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B/D</a>, blue). The EXO domain consists of a helix-two-turn-helix (H2TH) motif (helices \u03b110-\u03b111) accompanied by several \u03b1-hairpins (\u03b112-\u03b113 and \u03b114-\u03b115). A similar arrangement is also found in other proteins, which use a H2TH motif for non-sequence specific DNA recognition (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tomlinson et al., 2010</a>). The EXO domain in GEN1 has a 78 amino acid insertion (residues 245\u2013322), of which only helix \u03b112b (residues 308\u2013322) is ordered in the structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, gray and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Helix \u03b112b packs loosely with the H2TH helices (\u03b110-\u03b111) and helix \u03b112 at the 'finger' part of GEN1. Yeast Rad2, a homolog of human XPG, also contains helix \u03b112b, and it shows a similar arrangement as in GEN1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The EXO domain sandwiches the XPG-N/I domains with a long linker reaching from the bottom 'fingers' (\u03b110-\u03b113) along the backside of GEN1 to the top of the XPG-N/I domains at the 'wrist' (\u03b114-\u03b115). A structure-based sequence alignment of the nuclease core of human GEN1, FEN1, EXO1 and yeast Rad2 proteins with functional annotations relates sequence conservation to features in the Rad2/XPG family (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The comparison with members in the Rad2/XPG identified two DNA binding interfaces and a hydrophobic wedge (ball of the thumb) that separates the upstream and the downstream interface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C/D</a> and compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). GEN1 has two prominent grooves close to the hydrophobic wedge, which we termed upper and lower gate or gateway for comparison (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, orange and blue ellipses, respectively)."

A superposition of the aromatic cage of the five structurally most similar proteins with GEN1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) showed that residues W418, T438, and E440 are well conserved, whereas two residues at the rim of the canonical binding cleft are changed from phenylalanine/tyrosine to a leucine (L397) in one case and a proline (P421) in another (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Instead, Y424 occupies the space proximal to P421, which is about 1.5\u2009\u00c5 outwards of the canonical cage and widens the GEN1 cage slightly. The substitution of phenylalanine/tyrosine to leucine is also found in CBX chromo-shadow domains (see below); however, the rest of the GEN1 aromatic cage resembles rather chromodomains."

The analysis showed a tree branching into known subfamilies: chromobox proteins (CBX, red), chromodomain Y-linked proteins (CDY, yellow), chromodomain-helicase DNA-binding proteins (blue) and chromo-barrel domain proteins (green). The GEN1 chromodomain was found to be distantly related to the CDY chromodomains and chromobox proteins, particularly to the chromo-shadow domains of CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5. This agrees with the result from the DALI search, in which CBX chromo-shadow domains and homologs thereof were among the closest structural matches. Together with the observed differences in residues forming the aromatic cage, it indicates that the GEN1 chromodomain forms a new subgroup with features from chromo- and chromo-shadow domains that emerged from a common ancestor within CBX/CDY proteins."

The DNA is bound at the upstream interface and the hydrophobic wedge but does not extend into the active site or to the downstream interface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B/C/D</a>). Comparison of the structure of GEN1 to related structures of FEN1, Rad2 and EXO1 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Mi\u0119tus et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Orans et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>) suggests that a DNA substrate has to extend to the downstream interface to position a DNA strand for cleavage by the active site of GEN1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B/C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In the GEN1 structure, the end of the DNA arm attaches to the hydrophobic wedge provided by parts of helices \u03b12-\u03b13 and their connecting loop (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A/B</a>), forming van-der-Waals contacts with the first base pair, which docks perfectly onto the protruding curb of residues 41\u201351 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The uncleaved DNA strand is further stabilized and its geometrical arrangement is fixed by the upstream DNA-binding interface. Particularly, the DNA is contacted by a \u03b2-pin (strands \u03b26-\u03b27; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A/C</a>) from one side and by R54 and F58 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A/D</a>) from helix \u03b13 together with Y370 and K374 (helix \u03b115) from the opposite side (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A/C</a>). The key residues in the \u03b2-pin are T171 that forms a hydrogen bridge to the phosphate of the first base (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, 'G1') and M172 that makes a van-der-Waals contact to the DNA backbone at the second base (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, 'A2').

This indicates that also GEN1 undergoes such a disorder-to-order transition to form an arch with helices \u03b14 and \u03b16 upon substrate binding (<a href=\"#bib61\">Patel et al., 2012</a>) and similar to the arrangement in T5 FEN (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ceska et al., 1996</a>)."

To understand the functional relevance of the GEN1 structure for DNA recognition we performed a series of mutagenesis studies with single point mutations and truncated protein variants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1/2</a>) to investigate the effect on the active site (D30N), upstream DNA binding (R54E), downstream DNA binding (C36E), arch at the downstream interface (R89E, R93E, H109E, F110E), and chromodomain (\u0394chromo, K404E, R406E). We performed nuclease assays by titrating different amounts of GEN1 to a fixed DNA concentration of 40 nM for 15\u2009min and DNA cleavage products were analyzed by native electrophoresis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1/2</a>). We used an immobile HJ and a 5\u2019 flap substrate side-by-side to facilitate the comparison of the effects on separate GEN1 functions. Notably, stoichiometric amounts of GEN1 were required to cleave HJ substrates whereas 5\u2019 flaps were readily processed with catalytic amounts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

The arch was shown to facilitate cleavage by clamping flap substrates in FEN1 and the modification R100A showed a strong decrease in the cleavage activity (<a href=\"#bib61\">Patel et al., 2012</a>). The GEN1 R89E mutation, corresponding to residue R100 in FEN1, showed that the activity of GEN1 with a HJ substrate was not altered. In the case of a 5\u2019 flap substrate, cleavage was slightly reduced and it reached to the full level at enzyme concentrations higher than 10 nM. The effect of the R93E modification was even less pronounced compared to R89E. In contrast, the cleavage of both 5\u2019 flap and HJ substrates depended strongly on F110 at helix \u03b16 (thumb), which points towards the active site. An F110E modification showed a reduction in cleavage by 25% for HJ substrates, and the effect was even stronger for 5\u2019 flap substrates, where the activity is reduced by 65%. The equivalent position in FEN1 is V133 showing a critical involvement in stabilizing 5\u2019 flap DNA by orienting the -1 nucleotide for catalysis (<a href=\"#bib79\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>). We have also tested the effect of modifying H109, which neighbors the critical F110. Even though it points away from the active site, a glutamate at this position reduced 5\u2019 flap cleavage to 83% and HJ cleavage recovered only at high substrate concentrations of 256 nM. Overall, the results suggest that F110 has a key position for DNA recognition and processing."

Mutation of R486E and Y487A in Yen1, both of which are located near the base of the cage, corresponding to the W418 position in GEN1 (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), showed a strong effect on MMS sensitivity (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), similar to the one observed for the catalytic mutant, presumably due to a dysfunctional chromodomain. In contrast, mutations located further outside of the core (F478A and K484E) led to a less pronounced MMS sensitivity. The same was true for the K469E variant, which corresponds to position R406 at the chromodomain-DNA interface in GEN1 (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5F</a>), and for residues at the rim of the chromodomain (<i>yen1-N526A, yen1-L528D</i> and <i>yen1-W529A</i>), consistent with our in vitro\u00a0observation for GEN1<sup>T438E</sup> (slightly reduced activity, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). No effect on MMS sensitivity was detected for <i>yen1-L530A</i>, which corresponds to a conserved glutamate in chromodomains (E440 in GEN1).

The Yen1 variant lacking the chromodomain was expressed to levels similar to the full-length protein and we therefore conclude that the chromodomain is crucial for the function of Yen1.

                                "text": "The structure of the human GEN1 catalytic core provides the missing structural information in the Rad2/XPG family. The GEN1 structure complements recent reports on the structures of Rad2, EXO1 and FEN1, (<a href=\"#bib55\">Mi\u0119tus et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Orans et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>). Thereby, it gives insights how relatively conserved nuclease domains recognize diverse substrates in a structure-selective manner and act in different DNA maintenance pathways. In comparison with other Rad2/XPG nucleases, GEN1 shows many modifications on common structural themes that give the ability to recognize a diverse set of substrates including replication fork intermediates and HJs. The upstream DNA interface of GEN1 lacks the 'acid block' found in FEN1, instead it has a prominent groove at the same position (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, 'upper gate') with a strategically positioned R54 nearby. Furthermore, the helical arch in GEN1 misses helix \u03b15, which forms a cap structure in FEN1 and EXO1 that stabilizes 5\u2019 overhangs for cleavage. These features have implications for the recognition and cleavage of HJ substrates (see below). The most striking difference to other Rad2/XPG family members is that the GEN1 nuclease core is extended by a chromodomain, which provides an additional DNA anchoring point for the upstream DNA-binding interface. The evolutionarily conserved chromodomain is important for efficient substrate cleavage as we showed using truncation and mutation analyses. This finding opens new perspectives for the regulation of GEN1 and for its interactions with other proteins. Chromodomains serve as chromatin-targeting modules (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Blus et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Eissenberg, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yap and Zhou, 2011</a>), general protein interaction elements (<a href=\"#bib72\">Smothers and Henikoff, 2000</a>) as well as dimerization sites (<a href=\"#bib14\">Canzio et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Cowieson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Li et al., 2011</a>). These possibilities are particularly interesting, as chromatin targeting of proteins via chromodomains has been implicated in the DNA damage response. The chromatin remodeler CHD4 is recruited in response to DNA damage to decondense chromatin (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib59\">O\u2019Shaughnessy and Hendrich, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Stanley et al., 2013</a>). The chromodomains in CHD4 distinguish the histone modifications H3K9me3 and H3K9ac and determine the way how downstream DSB repair takes place (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ayrapetov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Price and D\u2019Andrea, 2013</a>). It is plausible that GEN1 uses its chromodomain not only as a structural module to securely bind DNA but also for targeting or regulatory purposes. Even though it was not possible to find any binding partner with a series of tested histone tail peptides, we cannot exclude that the chromodomain is used as an interaction motif or chromatin reader. It will therefore be interesting to extend our interaction analysis to a larger number of peptides and proteins. Interestingly, the modifications GEN1<sup>L397E</sup> and GEN1<sup>Y424A</sup> at the rim of the chromodomain did not alter DNA cleavage activity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), however, mutations of residues at the rim of Yen1\u2019s chromodomain show a phenotype, suggesting an additional role like binding to an endogenous factor."

                                "text": "Another intriguing aspect of the chromodomain is that the conserved T438 at the rim of the aromatic cage and T380 at the closing helix \u03b115 are both part of a casein kinase II consensus sequence for phosphorylation (Ser/Thr-X-X-Asp/Glu). <a href=\"#bib3\">Ayoub et al., 2008</a> showed that the analogous threonine in the chromodomain of CBX1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and phosphorylation disrupts the binding to H3K9me. We observed a reduction in DNA cleavage activity for the phosphorylation mimicking mutations T380E and T438E, which may suggest a regulatory role. They might function together and in combination with other modifications to provide a way of functional switching at the chromodomain. Furthermore, <a href=\"#bib11\">Blanco et al., 2014</a> and <a href=\"#bib25\">Eissler et al., 2014</a> recently identified several CDK phosphorylation sites in an insertion in the Yen1 chromodomain which affects HJ cleavage and together with phosphorylation of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the regulatory domain restricts Yen1\u2019s activity to anaphase. The insertion is not found in other chromodomains and it is extended in Yen1 compared to GEN1, which is lacking these phosphorylation sites (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A/B</a>). Notably, the activity of Yen1 is negatively regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Blanco et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chan and West, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Eissler et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Matos et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that the chromodomain is targeted by cell cycle kinases. It also provides a likely explanation for the different regulatory mechanisms found in GEN1 and Yen1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blanco and Matos, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chan and West, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Matos and West, 2014</a>). Exploration of the regulatory function of the GEN1 chromodomain will be an important topic to follow up, and this may lead to the understanding of the precise regulation mechanism of GEN1 as well as its substrate recognition under physiological conditions."

We extended the GEN1 structure by homology modeling of the disordered residues 79-92 (helix \u03b14) in GEN1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In addition to the similarity of this part to FEN1, the model readily showed the arrangement forming an arch structure. This would explain why GEN1 recognizes 5\u2019 flap substrates efficiently, analogous to FEN1, as the arch can clamp a single-stranded DNA overhang for productive cleavage. This also explains why the F110E modification in the arch at helix \u03b16 hampered 5\u2019 flap cleavage severely. The side chain points directly towards the active site and likely disturbs the stabilization of a 5\u2019 overhang for catalysis by charge repulsion. However, there are two features in GEN1 that vary from the arrangement in FEN1 and EXO1 considerably. Helix \u03b16 is longer (24 instead of 15 residues) and helix \u03b15 is missing in GEN1. As a result the arch points away from the DNA rather than forming a 'cap' structure as it is observed in FEN1 and EXO1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Orans et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the modified arch in GEN1 provides an opening, marked as 'lower gate' in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>. These differences are likely the basis for GEN1\u2019s versatile DNA recognition features."

By pointing away from the active site the arch provides an opening to accommodate unpaired, single-stranded DNA to pass along the arch at the lower gate (groove between \u03b12 and \u03b14) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> 'lower gate') from one GEN1 monomer to the upper gate (groove between \u03b12-\u03b13 and \u03b114) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> 'upper gate') of the other within a GEN1 dimer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B/C</a>). R54 is perfectly positioned at the minor groove to guide the second cleavage strand to pass through the upper gate (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B/C</a>, marked with a asterisk). In FEN1, this position is occupied by the 'acid block', which stabilizes a single 3\u2019 flap of the unpaired substrate (<a href=\"#bib79\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>) and it would not accommodate longer 3\u2019 DNA overhangs. In our model, two GEN1 monomers come together crosswise upon HJ binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The helical arches of both proteins likely provide additional protein-protein interactions as well as protein-DNA contacts by packing against the backbone of opposite DNA arms (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). As a result, the GEN1 dimer orients both active sites symmetrically across the junction point resembling the situation in bacterial RuvC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bennett and West, 1995a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">G\u00f3recka et al., 2013</a>).

                                "text": "The distance between both gates is bridged by unpaired bases in our GEN1-HJ model. This view is supported by the observation that FEN1 unpairs two bases near the active site through interactions with the hydrophobic wedge leading to strongly bent DNA arms between the upstream and downstream DNA interfaces. This mechanism seems to be a common feature of Rad2/XPG nucleases (<a href=\"#bib28\">Finger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Grasby et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with this view, the bacterial RuvC resolvase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) has also been shown to unfold HJ junctions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bennett and West, 1995b</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">G\u00f3recka et al., 2013</a>). In the case of GEN1, the critical step would be the assembly of the dimer around the junction point in a highly restraint way and the introduction of the first nick. This releases the tension on the complex like a spring leading to an immediate second cut and subsequent disassembly of the GEN1-HJ complex. Furthermore, a HJ does not provide free DNA ends and adopts a structure that intrinsically restrains its degrees of freedom, thus inhibiting cleavage by a single GEN1 monomer. Altogether we speculate that the arch (helix \u03b14-\u03b16) acts like a lever or hatch switching between flap and HJ recognition modes. When a free 5\u2019 end is available it closes and clamps the flap, thus positions the DNA for cleavage. For the case of a HJ substrate, the arch adopts an open conformation, allowing unpaired, single-stranded DNA to pass, while preventing the correct positioning of the DNA for catalysis at first. HJ cleavage is inhibited until a second GEN1 monomer binds. This mechanism differs from the one used by bacterial or bacteriophage HJ resolvases, which act as obligate dimers binding to DNA substrates in a concerted way (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). Our model for DNA cleavage by GEN1 describes a conformational switch provided by a flexible arch that can discriminate between substrates containing free 5\u2019 ends or those with a restraint structure like HJs. This aspect may explain our observation that GEN1 cleaves 5\u2019 flap DNA catalytically while stoichiometric amounts are required for HJ substrates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). Using a switchable hatch in a spring-loaded mechanism would be an efficient way of preventing a single cut at a HJ junction while allowing GEN1 to adapt to recognize various DNA substrates and perform different functional roles. Thus, GEN1 may have an intrinsic safety mechanism that ensures symmetrical dual incision across a branch point. Further studies have to address the exact engagement mechanism."

GEN1 may have to assemble in an accurate way before it can cleave a HJ. Likewise, it increases GEN1\u2019s persistence time on HJs and opens a window for branch migration for extending the length of recombined stretches of DNA. Moreover, GEN1 recognizes various DNA substrates, which may point towards a general role in processing substrates in different DNA maintenance pathways. GEN1 has been shown to cleave replication fork intermediates, and it is implicated in the resolution of replication-induced HJs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Garner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sarbajna et al., 2014</a>). Like MUS81-EME1, it might also be important for the processing of fragile sites to ensure proper chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib90\">Ying et al., 2013</a>). These functions have to be tested systematically to understand GEN1\u2019s biological role. In this context, the regulation of GEN1 is an important factor and needs to be explored. Our study identified a chromodomain extending the GEN1 nuclease core that might have a role in regulating the enzyme. An open question is the function and architecture of the remaining 444 amino acids at the C-terminus of GEN1. They are thought to regulate the nuclease activity and control subcellular localization (<a href=\"#bib11\">Blanco et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chan and West, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Garc\u00eda-Luis et al., 2014</a>).

The presented structure together with additional studies will help to unravel these questions and to obtain a comprehensive view of the functions of the Rad2/XPG nucleases."

The latter construct corresponds to the GEN1 fragment used for structural studies. The truncations showed a severe MMS hypersensitivity (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). This suggests that the C-terminal regulatory domain of Yen1 is critical for its function, in line with the reviewer\u2019s prediction. We are currently following up on this point."
