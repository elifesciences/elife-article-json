A complex of NuMA and dynein/dynactin is required for robust spindle orientation in a number of cell types. Previous research proposed that dynein/dynactin was sufficient to generate forces on microtubules (MTs) to orient spindles, with NuMA acting as a passive tether. In this study, we demonstrate that dynein/dynactin is insufficient for spindle orientation and that NuMA's MT-binding domain, which targets MT tips, is also required. Loss of NuMA-MT interactions caused defects in spindle orientation and epidermal differentiation, leading to neonatal lethality. We also show that loss of NuMA-MT interactions disrupts spindle orientation in the hair follicle matrix, resulting in defective differentiation of matrix-derived lineages. Our results reveal an additional and direct function of NuMA during mitotic spindle positioning, as well as a reiterative use of spindle orientation in the skin to build diverse structures."
