Previous studies have indicated that kinesin-14 motors are non-processive enzymes, working in the context of multi-motor ensembles that collectively organize microtubule networks. In this study, we show that the yeast kinesin-14 Kar3 generates processive movement as a heterodimer with the non-motor proteins Cik1 or Vik1. By analyzing the single-molecule properties of engineered motors, we demonstrate that the non-catalytic domain has a key role in the motility mechanism by acting as a \u2018foothold\u2019 that allows Kar3 to bias translocation towards the minus end. This mechanism rivals the speed and run length of conventional motors, can support transport of the Ndc80 complex in vitro and is critical for Kar3 function in vivo. Our findings provide an example for a non-conventional translocation mechanism and can explain how Kar3 substitutes for key functions of Dynein in the yeast nucleus."

Previous studies have indicated that kinesin-14 motors are non-processive enzymes, working in the context of multi-motor ensembles that collectively organize microtubule networks. In this study, we show that the yeast kinesin-14 Kar3 generates processive movement as a heterodimer with the non-motor proteins Cik1 or Vik1. By analyzing the single-molecule properties of engineered motors, we demonstrate that the non-catalytic domain has a key role in the motility mechanism by acting as a \u2018foothold\u2019 that allows Kar3 to bias translocation towards the minus end. This mechanism rivals the speed and run length of conventional motors, can support transport of the Ndc80 complex in vitro and is critical for Kar3 function in vivo. Our findings provide an example for a non-conventional translocation mechanism and can explain how Kar3 substitutes for key functions of Dynein in the yeast nucleus."

Processive motors can walk continuously along a microtubule for several hundred steps, whereas non-processive motors fall off after just a few steps. A motor protein called Kar3 belongs to a group of non-processive kinesins. Kar3 is unusual; unlike most of the motors in this group (which work together in pairs), Kar3 motor protein subunits each bind to and work with non-motor protein subunits, including one called Cik1. The head of the non-motor protein cannot bind to ATP, although it can bind to microtubules. This means that the non-motor protein subunits are not provided with the energy to make a stepping motion; this raises questions about how the Kar3 motor protein moves along the microtubule, and whether this affects the roles the motor performs."

Further investigation showed that Cik1 provides a \u2018foothold\u2019 for the motor, binding it to the microtubule in such a way that allows it to move along the microtubule in the opposite direction to most kinesins. In addition, Mieck et al. found that the Kar3\u2013Cik1 motor binds to and transports a protein complex that is crucial for separating chromosomes during cell division."

The mechanism by which kinesin motor proteins convert the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into coordinated, long-range directional movement has fascinated cell biologists, biochemists, and engineers for many decades. Biophysical studies of kinesins have focused on conventional Kinesin-1 and established the \u2018hand-over-hand\u2019 model for the processive walking behavior of this type of motor (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asbury et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yildiz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kaseda et al., 2003</a>).

They generate motility through the minus-end-directed rotational movement of a coiled-coil mechanical element that occurs upon ATP binding (<a href=\"#bib15\">Endres et al., 2006</a>). After each catalytic cycle, Ncd motors release from the microtubule lattice, meaning that to support microtubule sliding and crosslinking in the spindle, many Ncd motors must work together cooperatively in an ensemble (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braun et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fink et al., 2009</a>). Budding yeast kinesin-14 Kar3 is distinct from other family members in its heterodimeric composition with either Cik1 or Vik1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Manning et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). High-resolution structural analysis has shown that these accessory proteins contain a motor homology domain that harbors a microtubule binding site but lacks the structural elements required to bind and hydrolyze ATP (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allingham et al., 2007</a>). Biochemical experiments have indicated that Cik1 and Vik1 modulate the interaction of Kar3 with microtubules (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allingham et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rank et al., 2012</a>). In vivo Kar3's heterodimeric composition governs its subcellular localization and function: Kar3 in complex with Vik1 crosslinks parallel microtubules in proximity to spindle pole bodies during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Manning et al., 1999</a>), whereas antiparallel microtubule sliding is powered by Cik1\u2013Kar3 complexes that associate with the microtubule lattice and plus-ends during mitotic and meiotic events (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maddox et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gardner et al., 2008</a>). In addition, Kar3 has been implicated in kinetochore capture and transport (<a href=\"#bib33\">Middleton and Carbon, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tanaka et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2007</a>). The unusual composition of the Kar3 motor with the combination of a catalytic and a non-catalytic domain, as well as its key roles for diverse cellular processes in yeast, has made it a particularly interesting object of study both from a biophysical and cell biological point of view. The understanding of the mechanistic basis of Kar3 function, however, has remained incomplete, as biochemical experiments have been limited to ensemble assays using truncated or artificially dimerized proteins. On the basis of such experiments and the interpretation of in vivo phenotypes, it has been proposed that Cik1\u2013Kar3 acts as a microtubule depolymerase (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sproul et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allingham et al., 2007</a>). We hypothesized that the presence of a non-catalytic domain may allow functionalities fundamentally different from conventional kinesin-14 homodimers. As the activity of individual full-length Kar3 motors had not been observed directly, we developed assays to investigate motors at the single molecule level and analyze the contribution of the non-catalytic domain."

Purification and labeling yielded a homogenous preparation containing a heterodimer of Cik1 and TMR-labeled Kar3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). During size exclusion chromatography, Cik1\u2013Kar3 motors eluted as a single major peak with a Stokes radius of \u223c9.1 nm, well separated from the void volume of the column (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Sucrose-gradient centrifugation revealed the presence of a single major species with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of \u223c5.6S (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Combining these hydrodynamic values yielded a native molecular weight of 214 kDa, close to the calculated molecular weight of a Halo-tagged Cik1\u2013Kar3 heterodimer of 190 kDa. We further characterized the oligomeric state of full-length Cik1\u2013Kar3 motors by performing low-angle Pt/C rotary shadowing electron microscopy on peak fractions from the gel filtration experiments. This analysis revealed individual well-defined, highly elongated molecules that were characterized by globular domains separated by a 61 \u00b1 8 nm (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 100) long coiled-coil (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Typically, two closely spaced globular domains likely corresponding to catalytic and non-catalytic head domains were discernible at one end, while a single globular domain decorated the other (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The highly elongated shape of the Cik1\u2013Kar3 molecules can explain their early elution from the gel filtration column. Overall, the hydrodynamic analysis and the direct visualization of motor molecules by EM support the presence of heterodimeric Cik1\u2013Kar3 molecules."

Automated tracking of motors revealed a Gaussian velocity distribution of Cik1\u2013Kar3 with a mean speed of 77 \u00b1 23 nm/s (mean \u00b1 SD; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) in range with reported microtubule gliding velocities for truncated Cik1\u2013Kar3 molecules (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allingham et al., 2007</a>). The motor is therefore approximately 10-fold slower than conventional Kinesin-1, but similar in speed to yeast cytoplasmic Dynein, the major minus-end directed-motor in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>). The run-length histogram followed an exponential distribution and revealed that individual Cik1\u2013Kar3 motors advanced processively for an average of 5.2 \u03bcm before detaching from the microtubule track (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The motile parameters were highly sensitive to the ionic strength of the imaging buffer: at the same ATP concentration higher salt concentration increased the mean squared displacement of the motors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), but decreased the on-rate, run length and minus-end dwell time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We additionally noticed that Cik1\u2013Kar3 oscillated back-and-forth when entering microtubule overlap zones. Because Cik1\u2013Kar3 is exclusively moving towards the minus-end on single MT filaments, we concluded that reversing motors encountered an antiparallel-oriented MT bundle. Individual motors were able to switch the track microtubule multiple times leading to a prolonged association with antiparallel bundles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

Photobleaching experiments in the absence of nucleotide, in which the motor is persistently bound to the microtubule, revealed that 43 out of 50 molecules lost fluorescence in a single step consistent with the presence of a single Cik1\u2013Kar3 heterodimer (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Mixing experiments combining TMR- with Alexa488 labeled Cik1\u2013Kar3 molecules prior to imaging showed that the majority of moving complexes displayed exclusively either red or green fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). To discriminate between processive and non-processive motility modes by an alternative approach, we varied the motor concentration in a standard microtubule gliding assay. Titration of Cik1\u2013Kar3 over a 50-fold concentration range revealed no decrease in velocity for microtubule gliding, a characteristic feature of processive motility (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hancock and Howard, 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Contrary to previous reports, we did not observe substantial depolymerization of taxol-stabilized microtubules in the presence of Cik1\u2013Kar3. On dynamic microtubules motors moved towards the minus-ends, overall microtubule dynamics appeared unchanged in the presence of Cik1\u2013Kar3 and catastrophes did not coincide with plus-end localization of the motor (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>)."

To distinguish between these possibilities, truncation constructs were designed, systematically eliminating parts of the tail, coiled-coil, or globular domains of either the motor or the partner protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Truncation of the amino-terminal tail domain, either in Kar3 (up to aa 174) or in Cik1 (up to aa 250) allowed robust processive movement in the single molecule assay and also had little effect on multi-motor gliding velocity. This distinguishes Cik1\u2013Kar3 from the homodimeric <i>Drosophila</i> kinesin-14, Ncd, which has been shown to be capable of a weakly processive motion at very low ionic strength depending on its tail region that acts as an electrostatic tether to microtubules (<a href=\"#bib19\">Furuta and Toyoshima, 2008</a>). Further truncations of the coiled-coil interfered with heterodimer formation (not shown). In contrast, carboxyterminal truncations that either completely eliminated the predicted globular Cik1 motor homology domain (Cik1<sup>1\u2013360</sup>) or removed a portion of the carboxyterminus (Cik1<sup>1\u2013521</sup>) had severe effects and prevented directional movement. The specific nature of the defect was most apparent for the shorter truncation Cik1<sup>1\u2013521</sup>\u2013Kar3, which was able to bind microtubules under our standard conditions, but instead of smooth translocation it displayed erratic forward and backward displacements that did not lead to directional movement as revealed by kymographs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4 and 5</a>). The defect imposed by the Cik1<sup>1\u2013521</sup> mutation was also readily apparent in multi-motor gliding assays, where microtubules frequently switched their direction of movement and displayed little net transport (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The pronounced defect of the Cik1<sup>1\u2013521</sup> mutant points to an essential role for the non-catalytic head in the motility mechanism. To corroborate this point, we also co-overexpressed Flag-tagged Kar3 with Kar3-Halo and purified fluorescently labeled Kar3 homodimers that can form in the absence of Cik1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chu et al., 2005</a>). We failed to observe processive movement of Kar3-Kar3 combining two catalytic domains or of Kar3-Kar3<sup>rigor</sup> complexes combining catalytically active and inactive Kar3 heads (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These results point to a specific role of the non-catalytic Cik1 head that cannot be simply replaced by a second catalytically active or inactive Kar3 head."

To gain insights into this question, we quantitatively compared the microtubule-binding properties of single wild-type Cik1\u2013Kar3 molecules with a mutant that lacks the globular Cik1 motor homology domain (Cik1<sup>1\u2013360</sup>\u2013Kar3) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In contrast to wild-type motors, the Cik1<sup>1\u2013360</sup>\u2013Kar3 mutant displayed short-lived diffusive interactions with microtubules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). MSD data obtained in ATP for wild-type and mutant were fitted to the equation <x<sup>2</x<sup>&gt; = a\u00b7t<sup>n</sup>. n = 1 suggests standard diffusion and in this case, a = 2D, where D is the one-dimensional diffusion coefficient. For the mutant, an optimal fit was obtained with n = 1.01 \u00b1 0.04, indicating unconstrained diffusion with no directional component. By contrast, n = 1.96 \u00b1 0.03 was obtained for the wild-type motor, consistent with directional processive movement (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Further MSD analysis indicated that the mutant is about 20-fold more diffusive than the wild-type motor in the no nucleotide state (D = 0.01 \u00b1 0.0006 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s vs 0.00045 \u00b1 0.00011 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s) and about 30-fold more diffusive in the AMPPNP state (D = 0.0036 \u00b1 0.00011 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s vs 0.00011 \u00b1 0.00001 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Further analysis indicated that the Cik1<sup>1\u2013360</sup> mutation also increased diffusion in the ADP state, but the difference was less pronounced in comparison to the other states (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). We additionally constructed and purified a monomeric Kar3 head encompassing residues 353\u2013729 with an N-terminal Halo-Tag. Under standard imaging conditions in the presence of ATP only very short-lived microtubule interactions without directional movement could be observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Taken together, these results indicate only a heterodimer containing a non-catalytic Cik1 head is able to move processively and a key contribution of the non-catalytic domain is to promote tight, non-diffusive binding of the motor in no nucleotide and AMPPNP states."

The non-catalytic proteins Cik1 and Vik1 are paralogs that display about 45% sequence similarity between each other. We purified Vik1\u2013Kar3 complexes from yeast extracts and imaged their interaction with microtubules under the same conditions as previously employed for Cik1\u2013Kar3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Interestingly, Vik1\u2013Kar3 also displayed highly processive movement, but with faster velocity compared to Cik1\u2013Kar3. Under standard assay conditions, Vik1\u2013Kar3 complexes moved at 234 \u00b1 29 nm/s towards microtubule minus-ends where they strongly accumulated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). To ask how these differences might be determined by the non-catalytic partner, we constructed a chimeric protein in which the globular motor homology domain and the neck of Vik1 (aa 351\u2013647) were fused to the tail domain of Cik1 (aa 1\u2013353) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The Vik1\u2013Cik1 chimera formed a stable heterodimer with Kar3-HALO and supported movement with 188 nm/s to the minus-end, significantly faster than Cik1\u2013Kar3 and approaching the velocity of Vik1\u2013Kar3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Thus, the globular non-catalytic domain is a key determinant for setting the velocity of the motor. The engineered chimeric protein was able to functionally replace Cik1 in cells as demonstrated by its ability to rescue the phenotypes of a Cik1 deletion and to support growth at wild type level under all tested conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

To identify such interactors, we performed affinity purifications of Cik1\u2013FLAG at different cell cycle stages and analyzed associated proteins by mass spectrometry. In addition to Kar3, we reproducibly mapped two plus-end tracking proteins Bim1 and Bik1, the EB1 and CLIP-170 homologues of budding yeast, as well as the microtubule-binding Ndc80 kinetochore complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). By performing pull-down assays with recombinant proteins, we established that Cik1\u2013Kar3, but not Vik1\u2013Kar3, directly interacted with Bim1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The binding interface involved the C-terminal EB homology domain of Bim1 and the aminoterminal tail domain of Cik1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). A physical interaction with Bim1 may account for the previously observed microtubule plus-end localization of Cik1\u2013Kar3 in vivo (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sproul et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gardner et al., 2008</a>). Live cell imaging showed that the localization of Kar3 to distinct foci along the yeast spindle, as well as to the tips of shmoo-tip-directed microtubules in alpha-factor-arrested cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), was abolished in a <i>bim1\u0394</i> strain, pheno-copying a <i>cik1</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib32\">Manning et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D,E</a>). Consistent with our biochemical experiments, spindle localization was maintained in the Cik1<sup>1\u2013360</sup> and Cik1<sup>1\u2013521</sup> mutants. Thus, the Cik1 tail domain specifies the differential localization of Kar3 in vivo by allowing a direct interaction with Bim1."

                                "text": "The insights into the localization determinants of the Kar3 motor allowed us to evaluate the key roles of Kar3 in the cell: yeast strains expressing Cik1<sup>1\u2013360</sup> or Cik1<sup>1\u2013521</sup> from the endogenous chromosomal locus displayed slow growth at 25\u00b0C and were inviable at 37\u00b0C, similar to a <i>cik1</i> deletion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). By contrast neither a <i>bim1</i> deletion, which eliminates spindle localization, nor a <i>vik1</i> deletion, removing spindle pole localization, displayed a pronounced growth phenotype (data not shown). Together with our finding that the Vik1<sup>head</sup>\u2013Cik1<sup>tail</sup> chimera fully supports viability, this implies that the key function of Kar3 in vegetatively growing yeast cells requires motility\u2014supported by any of the two non-catalytic heads\u2014and the Cik1 tail domain, but does not involve spindle localization via Bim1. Based on previously characterized mutants and on our finding that the Ndc80 complex co-purifies with Cik1, this supports a key role for Kar3 at the kinetochore. Consistent with this notion, we found that 80% of Cik1<sup>1\u2013521</sup> cells arrested as large budded cells upon shift to the restrictive temperature, indicative of mitotic checkpoint activation. Analysis of chromosome segregation at the semi-permissive temperature of 25\u00b0C by fluorescent labeling of chromosome V showed that 50% of large budded Cik1 mutant cells attempted nuclear division without proper bi-orientation of sister chromatids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). We conclude that the key contribution of the non-conventional Cik1 motility mechanism for cell proliferation lies in the promotion of sister chromatid bi-orientation in mitosis."

In the absence of motor, the Ndc80 complex only weakly associated with taxol-stabilized microtubules under standard conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Vik1\u2013Kar3 motors strongly decorated microtubules in the absence of ATP, but had no effect on the Ndc80 complex. By contrast, combining Cik1\u2013Kar3 and the Ndc80 complex resulted in decoration of microtubules with both molecules. Upon lowering protein concentrations, Cik1\u2013Kar3 and the Ndc80 complex co-localized to distinct spots on the microtubule where their intensities were correlated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Inclusion of ATP initiated co-transport of the Ndc80 complex and Cik1\u2013Kar3 towards the minus end (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). While transporting the Ndc80 complex, the average speed of the motor was 76 \u00b1 15 nm/s (mean \u00b1 SD), indicating that cargo binding did not significantly impede movement. The value is also in range with the reported velocity for kinetochore transport in vivo (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tanaka et al., 2005</a>). Microtubule binding by the Ndc80 complex was not required for efficient transport, as shown by effective recruitment and translocation of the microtubule-binding defective calponin-homology domain mutant K122E K204E (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lampert et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result is in agreement with the observation that Kar3 localizes to unattached kinetochores prior to microtubule binding. We conclude that the Ndc80 complex can be transported by the Kar3 motor in vitro and that in addition to promoting processive motility a key function of Cik1 may lie in the differential binding of this complex."

So far this point has been most clearly demonstrated for the Dynein motor, as recent studies have shown that cytoplasmic dynein is capable of processive movement in vitro despite inactivating mutations in one of the two force-generating AAA ring domains (<a href=\"#bib13\">DeWitt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Qiu et al., 2012</a>), or even as a combination of one active head with a second passive microtubule-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cleary et al., 2014</a>)."

We could not detect evidence for processive movement of monomeric Kar3, making it unlikely that it works via a KIF1A-type mechanism. Among the kinesin-14 family, Ncd can exhibit processive motility but requires at least two homodimers coupled together (<a href=\"#bib18\">Furuta et al., 2013</a>). A number of studies have shown that inactivating mutations in one of the two heads of conventional kinesin can still allow residual processivity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Subramanian and Gelles, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thoresen and Gelles, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kaseda et al., 2003</a>). We note, however, that in these examples processive movement of the mutant heterodimeric kinesins was compromised compared to wild-type homodimers. By contrast, Kar3 does not simply tolerate the loss of a second active head but instead it has evolved a specific requirement for the non-catalytic domain in order to move processively. In other words, Kar3 can only walk with a combination of an active and an inactive \u2018leg\u2019."

Based on the results obtained in this and in previous studies, we propose a working model that describes the non-catalytic head as a \u2018foothold\u2019 for Kar3. Based on recent structural data Kar3 and its partner non-catalytic head may be located on adjacent protofilaments (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rank et al., 2012</a>), where the non-catalytic domain could contribute to hold the motor complex in place and prevent diffusion. During its ATP cycle, the motor goes through rounds of tightly and weakly bound states. When ADP is bound, the motor is in its weakly bound state which allows for one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule lattice. On its own, movement in this state would lack directionality and an additional mechanism providing minus-end directed bias is required. We speculate that the presence of Cik1 in combination with the kinesin-14 typical stalk rotation upon ATP binding by Kar3 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Endres et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gonzalez et al., 2013</a>) might provide such a mechanism either by shifting the overall position of the molecule or by allowing subsequent directed binding/unbinding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Because of the combination of one foot on the track and a diffusive movement to the next binding site, we refer to this possible mechanism as the \u2018skateboard\u2019 model. This model can explain a number of our experimental observations: the effect of raising the ionic strength is that initially motor movement occurs with faster velocity, probably by increasing the diffusion term. At some point however, stable binding of the non-catalytic domain is prevented and directional displacement is disrupted, similar to the situation in which the motor lacks the motor homology domain. In addition, diffusive movement in the ADP state and the observed large variation in movement rates are compatible with the model. The biochemical properties of the non-catalytic head binding to the microtubule will have profound effects on the motile characteristics as evidenced by the different properties of Cik1\u2013Kar3 and Vik1\u2013Kar3 motors."

In agreement with previous work, this suggests that similar to conventional kinesins, a form of head-to-head communication must occur in Kar3 motors such that the catalytic head influences the microtubule affinity of the motor homology domain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allingham et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Duan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rank et al., 2012</a>).

                                "text": "What are the implications of Kar3's processivity? The ability to move processively may be used in the cell to enrich Kar3 motors at minus-ends. In addition, Kar3 could work more effectively in small teams if it can undergo multiple catalytic cycles before releasing from the microtubule. This may be especially important during kinetochore transport, where Ndc80 complexes can provide only a limited number of binding sites for the motor. Kar3 heterodimers have probably evolved from conventional Kinesin14-homodimers that performed Ncd-like roles in spindle organization. We speculate that with the exclusion of dynein from the budding yeast nucleus additional functional requirements for minus-end directed motility in spindle assembly and kinetochore function arose that could be fulfilled with the \u2018invention\u2019 of the Cik1 and Vik1 non-catalytic domains. While commonly perceived as conferring a loss of functionality, the pseudo-motor domains have the ability to convert a kinesin-14 into a processive motor and additionally create functional diversity through allowing differential interactions with partners. Together this allows Kar3 to function as a processsive sliding and transport motor that substitutes for key roles of dynein in the yeast nucleus. Other examples for heterodimeric motors exist in the Kinesin-2 family with different subunits conferring distinct activities (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brunnbauer et al., 2010</a>). Kar3 motors may therefore constitute an extreme example for such diversification strategies that could be more widely used in other motor families. More generally, we note that pseudoenzymes have emerging roles in other cellular contexts, for example in the form pseudo-GTPases during human kinetochore assembly (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basilico et al., 2014</a>), or as pseudo-kinases and pseudo-phosphatases in cell signaling (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boudeau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tonks, 2009</a>). This may suggest that the use of catalytically inactive enzyme derivatives could be a more widespread strategy employed by the cell. The establishment of an in vitro assay for Ndc80 transport serves as a starting point for a detailed analysis of the function and regulation of kinetochore motility. Furthermore, the unique design principle of the Kar3 motor, which allows the same catalytic domain to be paired with different non-catalytic heads, generates functional diversity that may also be exploited in nanotechnological applications."

The non-catalytic motor subunit was tagged C-terminally with 1xFLAG and the motor itself was fused to a HaloTag (DHA, Promega) at the 5\u2032 end of the coding sequence, separated by a 13 amino acid linker. Mutated and truncated versions of Cik1 and Kar3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis PCR (Phusion, Thermo Scientific). To determine the TMR-labeling efficiency, Halo-Kar3 was fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), creating Halo-eGFP-Kar3. All motor proteins were overexpressed in budding yeast using the pESC vectors (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, yeast cells harboring the respective pESC plasmid were induced with 2% Galactose at OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.0 for 7\u20139 hr, harvested by centrifugation, washed, and frozen as droplets in liquid nitrogen. Lysis was conducted in liquid nitrogen using a freezer mill (Biospec Inc.).

The agarose resin was washed five times with lysis buffer (adjusted to 150 mM NaCl, 0.09% Tween-20, omitting the PhosSTOP reagent). Elution of the kinesin heterodimeric constructs from M2 agarose was achieved by applying one resin volume of 3xFLAG peptide at final 2 mg/ml in lysis buffer (adjusted to 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.09% Tween-20, omitting ATP and PhosSTOP). If needed, the elution was loaded onto a cation exchange chromatography (MonoS 5/50 GL, GE Healthcare) in running buffer (10 mM Hepes [pH 7.2], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA) to remove the FLAG peptide. Afterwards a linear salt gradient eluted a single peak, pure motor fraction at 250 mM salt. Elution fractions were supplemented with glycerol (final concentration: 5%), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The protein concentration was measured using the DC Assay kit (Bio-Rad).

Porcine-derived HiLyte-647-labeled, biotinylated and taxol-stabilized microtubules (MTs) were immobilized (labeled and biotinylated tubulin source: Cytoskeleton Inc., unlabeled tubulin was purified from pig brains as described previously [<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashford and Hyman, 2006</a>]) and excess of MTs was washed out with BRB80 buffer supplemented with 5 \u03bcM taxol, 0.5% (vol/vol) \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 4.5 \u03bcg/ml glucose, 200 \u03bcg/ml glucose-oxidase, and 35 \u03bcg/ml catalase. Single molecule imaging was performed by introducing the TMR- or Alexa488-labeled kinesins at low nanomolar range in assay buffer (BRB80, 0.33 mg/ml casein, 16.6 \u03bcM taxol, 0.13% [vol/vol] methylcellulose, 0.5% [vol/vol] \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 4.5 \u03bcg/ml glucose, 200 \u03bcg/ml glucose-oxidase and 35 \u03bcg/ml catalase, 0.06% [vol/vol] Tween-20, the indicated amount of KCl and the respective amount of nucleotide) into the flow cell. Time-lapse videos were recorded at 28\u00b0C in 3 s intervals between frames (if not annotated differently) using a TIRF microscopy setup described previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lampert et al., 2010</a>). Multi-color imaging was achieved by the use of an external filterwheel (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd.). Each channel (excitation: 488 nm, 561 nm, 639 nm) was exposed for 100 ms at every time-interval, recorded by a Cascade II EMCCD camera and projected to two-dimensional images (software: Metamorph [Molecular Devices], ImageJ). For photobleaching analysis, the oxygen-scavenger mix was omitted (\u03b2-mercaptoethanol, glucose, glucose-oxidase, catalase), and images were recorded at maximum laser power. Videos are represented as kymographs (time-space plot) or as example single frame (software: MetaMorph [Molecular Devices])."
