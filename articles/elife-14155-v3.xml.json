Rodent models of DYT1 dystonia, a motor disorder caused by a single gene mutation, demonstrate increased long-term potentiation and decreased long-term depression in corticostriatal synapses. Computationally, such asymmetric learning predicts risk taking in probabilistic tasks. Here we demonstrate abnormal risk taking in DYT1 dystonia patients, which is correlated with disease severity, thereby supporting striatal plasticity in shaping choice behavior in humans."

Rodent models of DYT1 dystonia, a motor disorder caused by a single gene mutation, demonstrate increased long-term potentiation and decreased long-term depression in corticostriatal synapses. Computationally, such asymmetric learning predicts risk taking in probabilistic tasks. Here we demonstrate abnormal risk taking in DYT1 dystonia patients, which is correlated with disease severity, thereby supporting striatal plasticity in shaping choice behavior in humans."

Likewise, if we get less reward than expected, the chosen option\u2019s value decreases."

In this model, the activity of the neurons in the cortex represents the options, and the value of these options is represented by the activity of neurons in the striatum. Strengthening the connections is thought to increase the value of the stimulus, but this theory has been difficult to test."

Picking the sure option guaranteed the player would receive a small amount of money, whereas the risky option gave either double this amount or nothing. The theory predicts that the double rewards should cause the patients to learn abnormally high values, which would lure them into making risky choices.

Clinically, DYT1 dystonia is characterized by variable severity of sustained or intermittent muscle contractions that produce abnormal movements. DYT1 dystonia patients have normal intelligence, and post-mortem examination of their brains does not reveal obvious abnormalities or evidence of neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib27\">Paudel et al., 2012</a>). Nevertheless, research in two different rodent models of DYT1 dystonia points to the existence of a fundamental deficit in synaptic plasticity. Specifically, brain slices of transgenic rodents expressing the human mutant <i>TOR1A</i> gene show abnormally strong long-term potentiation (LTP; <a href=\"#bib21\">Martella et al., 2009</a>) and weak, or even absent, long-term depression (LTD; <a href=\"#bib17\">Grundmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Martella et al., 2009</a>) in corticostriatal synapses, as compared to wild-type controls."

The core assumptions of this theory are that (1) dopamine release in the striatum signals errors in the prediction of reward, with dopamine levels increasing following successful actions (to signal a positive prediction error) and decreasing when actions fail to achieve the expected outcome (a negative prediction error), (2) fluctuations in dopamine modulate downstream plasticity in recently active corticostriatal synapses such that synapses responsible for positive prediction errors are strengthened through long-term potentiation (LTP), and those that led to disappointment are weakened through long-term depression (LTD) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Reynolds et al., 2001</a>), and (3) the efficacy of corticostriatal transmission affects voluntary action selection."

However, the contribution of (dopamine modulated) corticostriatal plasticity to shaping action has remained unconfirmed in the behaving organism, as it is not clear that the behavioral effects of altered dopamine signaling in Parkinson\u2019s disease (and other conditions in which dopamine transmission is compromised) indeed stem from the role of dopamine in modulating plasticity. Towards this end, here we test whether DYT1 dystonia, where corticostriatal plasticity is suggested to be altered despite preserved dopaminergic signaling, leads to the behavioral effects predicted by reinforcement learning with imbalanced plasticity. In particular, our predictions stem from considering the effects of intact prediction errors on an altered plasticity mechanism that amplifies the effect of positive prediction errors (i.e., responds to positive prediction errors with more LTP than would otherwise occur in controls) and mutes the effects of negative prediction errors (that is, responds with weakened LTD as compared to controls)."

Based on the findings in rodents with the DYT1 mutation, we predicted that dystonia patients would learn preferentially from positive prediction errors (putatively due to abnormally strong LTP) and to a much lesser extent from negative prediction errors (due to weak LTD) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>).

Top: trials in which the risky cue is chosen and the obtained outcome is larger than expected (trials with a 10\u00a2 outcome) should result in strengthening of corticostriatal connections (LTP), thereby increasing the expected value of the cue and the tendency to choose it in the future. Conversely, outcomes that are smaller than expected (0\u00a2) should cause synaptic weakening (LTD) and a resulting decrease in choice probability. Middle: In DYT1 dystonia patients (red solid), increased LTP combined with decreased LTD are expected to result in an overall higher learned value for the risky cue, as compared to controls (blue dashed). In the model, this is reflected in higher probability of choosing the risky cue when presented together with sure 5\u00a2 cue (Bottom).

These results verify that both groups understood the task instructions and could perform the task similarly well (in terms of choosing and executing their responses fast enough, etc.). Participants evidenced learning of values for deterministically-rewarded cues even in the first choice trials despite the fact that they were never informed verbally or otherwise of the monetary outcomes associated with each of the cues, and\u00a0thus could only learn these from experience. However, for cues leading to deterministic outcomes, a little experience can go a long way (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shteingart et al., 2013</a>), and participants received 16 training trials prior to the test phase. Our data suggest that learning in this phase did not differ between the groups: in the first 5 choice trials in the test phase that involved a pair of sure cues, the probability of a correct response was 0.78 \u00b1 0.18 in the DYT group and 0.81 \u00b1 0.07 in the CTL group (Mann-Whitney U test, df\u00a0=\u00a024, P\u00a0=\u00a00.59).

As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, participants\u2019 tendency to choose the risky 0/10 cue over the same-mean 5\u00a2 cue was dynamically adjusted according to experience: if the previous choice of the risky cue was rewarded with 10\u00a2, participants were significantly more likely to choose the risky cue again on the next time it was available, as compared to the case in which the previous choice of the risky cue resulted in 0\u00a2. To verify that the value of the risky cue was continuously updated, we calculated the proportion of choices of the risky cue over the sure 5\u00a2 cue after different outcomes of the previous instance in which the risky cue was selected, for different time bins throughout the task (15 risky trials in each). A three way ANOVA (group X outcome X time-bin) revealed a significant effect for group (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001), outcome (win or loss; P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) and no effect of time-bin or interactions. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that the differences between win and loss conditions were significant in all bins for the DYT group only (all Ps\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05, two tailed). The first two bins for the CTL group approached significance (P\u00a0=\u00a00.054, two-tailed). This analysis showed that DYT patients changed their behavior based on outcomes of the risky cue throughout training. Control participants, on the other hand, evidenced somewhat less learning as the task continued, with their behavior in the last quarter of training settling on a risk-averse policy that was not sensitive to local outcomes. In reinforcement learning, this could result from a gradual decrease of learning rates, which is optimal in a stationary environment. Indeed, the final risk-averse policy was predicted by our model, based on the ratio of positive and negative learning rates. In any case, these results suggest that participants learned to evaluate the risky cue based on experienced rewards, and that the locally fluctuating value of the risky cue affected choice behavior, at least in the first half of the experiment, and for the DYT group, throughout the experiment. (<b>b</b>) Recent work on similar reinforcement learning tasks has shown that choice trials and forced trials may exert different effects on learning (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cockburn et al., 2014</a>). To test for this effect in our data, we examined separately the probability of choosing the risky cue over the sure cue following wins or losses, after either forced or choice trials. Our analysis revealed that choices were significantly dependent upon the previous outcome of the risky cue (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01, F\u00a0=\u00a07.45, <i>df\u00a0</i>=\u00a01 for main effect of win versus loss; 3-way ANOVA with factors outcome, choice and group) but not upon its context (P\u00a0=\u00a00.38, F\u00a0=\u00a00.93, <i>df\u00a0</i>=\u00a01 for main effect of forced vs. choice trials). Similar to <a href=\"#bib10\">Cockburn et al. (2014)</a>, we did observe a numerically smaller effect of the outcome of forced trials (as compared to choice trials) on future choices, however this was not significant (interaction between outcome and choice P\u00a0=\u00a00.46, F\u00a0=\u00a00.56, <i>df\u00a0</i>=\u00a01). <i>P</i> values in the figure reflect paired t-tests."

Moreover, the impetus for our experiment was an <i>a priori</i> hypothesis regarding risk sensitivity as a consequence of asymmetric learning, based on findings from the mouse model of DYT1 dystonia, which has no straightforward equivalent interpretation in terms of nonlinear utilities. We note also that strongly nonlinear utilities in the domain of small payoffs such as those we used here are generally unlikely (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rabin and Thaler, 2001</a>), again suggesting that risk sensitivity is more likely to arise in our experiment from asymmetric learning. Another alternative explanation for behavior in our task, is a win-stay lose-shift strategy that is perhaps utilized to different extent by DYT1 patients and controls.

Indeed, the DYT1 mouse model has also been linked to impaired plasticity in the indirect pathway due to D2 receptor dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beeler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Napolitano et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wiecki et al., 2009</a>), which can\u00a0lead to abnormal reinforcement (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kravitz et al., 2012</a>)."

In particular, current evidence suggests that\u00a0corticostriatal LTP following positive prediction errors and LTD following negative prediction errors occur in D1 striatal neurons (direct pathway), whereas plasticity in D2-expressing neurons (indirect pathway) is in the opposite direction (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kravitz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shen et al., 2008</a>). As the direct pathway supports choice (\u2018Go\u2019) while the indirect pathway supports avoidance (\u2018NoGo\u2019), under this implementation of reinforcement learning both types of learning eventually lead to the same behavioral outcome: a positive prediction error increases the probability that the action/choice that led to the prediction error would be repeated in the future, and vice versa for negative prediction errors. As such, at the algorithmic level in which our asymmetric learning model was cast, the differences we have shown between dystonia patients and controls would still be expected to manifest behaviorally through diminished risk-aversion in dystonia patients."

(b) Abnormally strong LTP/weak LTD in D1-expressing striatal neurons and the opposite pattern, abnormally strong LTD and/or weak LTP in D2-expressing striatal neurons of the indirect pathway in DYT1 dystonia. As a result, a positive prediction error would generate extra strong positive learning in the Go pathway, and a similarly large decrease in the propensity to avoid this stimulus due to activity in the 'NoGo' pathway. Conversely, learning from negative prediction errors would generate relatively little decrease in the propensity to 'Go' to the stimulus and little increase in the propensity to 'NoGo'. In both cases, the effect on both pathways would be in the same direction as is seen in the behavioral asymmetry. (c) Finally, abnormalities may exist in both pathways in the same direction (stronger LTP and weaker LTD), but with a larger effect on LTP as compared to LTD. In this case, a positive prediction error would increase 'Go' activity considerably, but not decrease 'NoGo' activity to the same extent. Negative prediction errors, on the other hand, would increase 'NoGo' propensities while decreasing 'Go' propensities to a lesser extent. This type of asymmetry can explain why the rodent studies suggested almost absent (not only weaker) LTD, but nevertheless, patients did not behave as if they did not learn at all from negative prediction errors. Unfortunately, our model and behavioral results cannot differentiate between these three options. We hope that future data, especially from transgenic DYT1 rodents, will clarify this issue."

Humans with preserved function of the basal ganglia have been shown to be risk-averse in such tasks. We showed that patients with DYT1 dystonia are more risk-neutral, a rational pattern of behavior given our reward statistics, and in such tasks in general. While this type of behavior may offer advantages under certain conditions, it may also contribute to impaired reinforcement learning of motor repertoire and fixation on actions that were once rewarded. In any case, these reinforcement-learning manifestations of what has been considered predominantly a motor disease provide support for linking corticostriatal synaptic plasticity and overt trial-and-error learning behavior in humans."

To replicate those results in our sample population, we compared the asymmetric learning model to three other alternative models. The first was a classical reinforcement\u00a0learning model with no learning asymmetry <math id=\"inf13\"><mrow><msup><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>w</mi></mrow></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>\u03b7</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>\u2212</mo><msup><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></math>. The second alternative model was based on the classical nonlinear (diminishing) subjective utility of monetary rewards. The idea is that the 10\u00a2 reward may not be subjectively equal to twice the 5\u00a2 reward, therefore engendering risk-sensitive choices in our task. We thus defined learning in a nonlinear utility model as <math id=\"inf14\"><mrow><msup><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>w</mi></mrow></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>\u03b7</mi><mrow><mo>[</mo> <mrow><mi>U</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2212</mo><msup><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow> <mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo><mo>\u00a0</mo></mrow></math>\u00a0where <i>U(R)</i> is the subjective utility of reward <i>R</i>. Without loss of generality, we parameterized the utility function over the three possible outcomes (0\u00a2, 5\u00a2 or 10\u00a2) by setting U(0) = 0, U(5) = 5 and U(10) = <i>a</i>\u00d710, where the parameter <i>a</i> could be larger, equal to or smaller than 1, and was fit to the data of each participant separately. If the effect of a loss is larger than that of a gain of the same magnitude, <i>a</i> should be smaller than 1. Finally, we tested a win-stay-lose-shift strategy model that is equivalent to the classic reinforcement\u00a0learning model with a learning rate of 1. All models used the softmax choice function with an inverse temperature parameter <math id=\"inf15\"><mi>\u03b2</mi></math>. The parameters of each of the models were fit to each participant\u2019s data as was done for the asymmetric learning model."

For example, given the current claims it is important to verify that the risk-taking effect is demonstrably a learning effect rather than a choice-like effect or a WSLS type effect that would not implicate striatal plasticity.

Neurosci., 2009) but the novelty of this report is that it examines the impact of a dopaminergic/striatal change occurring in a type of dystonia, DYT1 dystonia, that is, in a sense, the opposite way round (in the sense that there is an increase in LTP/decrease in LTD in transgenic animals). Perhaps the only other way to conduct a test of this sort is by examining the impact of dopamine increases by L-DOPA treatment (e.g. Pessiglione et al., Nature, 2006)."

Although I agree that the results are interesting I was not always quite sure precisely how the authors intended to frame them. Perhaps changing or adding a few words in the Introduction or Discussion might help provide the final clarification needed. The current version emphasizes that the dystonic condition is associated with a change in LTP/LTD balance and emphasizes that this might lead to a change in learning from positive prediction errors. By contrast when discussing studies in Parkinson's patients they seem to emphasize dopaminergic changes. Is it not the case that changes in dopamine (or its balance with other neurotransmitters) occur both in Parkinson's patients and dystonic patients and that as a consequence both will be expected to lead to changes in LTP /LTD ratios. Or is there no evidence of a change in LTP/LDT in Parkinson's disease?"

Subjects learned to select between pairs of cues (or are forced to pick one). Three cues lead deterministically to 0, 5 or 10c, and the last one to 0 or 10c with equal probability. Risk was assessed by the choice between the 5c and the probabilistic cues, which have same expected value. The authors show that controls are significantly more risk-averse in this task than patients, who appear to be risk neutral. They show evidence that this is not due to patients choosing randomly, but that they are sensitive to previous reward and thus presumably learning the value over time. They argue that the behavioral difference can be accounted for by assuming variable learning rates for positive vs. negative prediction errors, with a greater asymmetry for patients than controls. The authors hypothesize, based on a rodent model showing abnormally high LTP and low LTD, that the observed behavioral effects thus reflect differences in synaptic plasticity."

Furthermore, the behavioral evidence tying risk taking to learning here is also weak (see next point).

The application of genetically linked animal models and human disease states in concert with an algorithmic description of a learning mechanism offers an exciting and constructive path forward. However, this depends critically on a shared mechanism between the animal model and the human brain. I cannot speak to the quality of the animal models or the nature of DYT1 dystonia; however, the text leaves some question as to the shared commonality. The authors point to atypical LPT/LTD in animal models, but abnormal dopamine/acetylcholine transmission in humans. Given the manuscript's emphasis on lessening the gap between synapse and behavior, I feel that the manuscript could benefit from more support linking animal and human disorders (perhaps via behavioral patterns in the animal models, mechanisms through which medications operate etc.)."

But, this response pattern does not necessitate a reinforcement learning strategy. These data also appear to be consistent with a win-stay/lose-shift strategy (WS/LS). Given the 50% chance of reward on the risky stimulus, a WS/LS strategy is consistent with the reported lack of risk aversion. Furthermore, the model generated response pattern illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> (bottom panel), suggests that a reinforcement learning strategy becomes increasingly risk averse. There does appear to be some trend of increasing risk aversion in controls, but not so for the patient group. Given that there are no clear response patterns that demonstrate a reinforcement learning strategy (i.e. there are no learning curves etc.), I feel that the results would be more interpretable if a WS/LS model was also included in the analysis and Discussion."

Although I agree that the results are interesting I was not always quite sure precisely how the authors intended to frame them. Perhaps changing or adding a few words in the Introduction or Discussion might help provide the final clarification needed. The current version emphasizes that the dystonic condition is associated with a change in LTP/LTD balance and emphasizes that this might lead to a change in learning from positive prediction errors. By contrast when discussing studies in Parkinson's patients they seem to emphasize dopaminergic changes. Is it not the case that changes in dopamine (or its balance with other neurotransmitters) occur both in Parkinson's patients and dystonic patients and that as a consequence both will be expected to lead to changes in LTP /LTD ratios. Or is there no evidence of a change in LTP/LDT in Parkinson's disease?</i>"

Lack of response of patients with DYT1 dystonia to either dopaminergic agonists or antagonists furthermore supports the assumption that striatal levels of dopamine do not play a role in DYT1 dystonia. The physiological importance of certain impairments such as reduced dopamine release triggered by amphetamine (Balcioglu et al., 2007) and increase dopamine turnover (Zhao et al., 2008) is still unknown."

Given the 50% chance of reward on the risky stimulus, a WS/LS strategy is consistent with the reported lack of risk aversion. Furthermore, the model generated response pattern illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> (bottom panel), suggests that a reinforcement learning strategy becomes increasingly risk averse.

Intuitively, if the risky option at some point has a lower value than the sure option, the risky option will be chosen less often and thus its value will not be updated, leaving it lower than the sure option (whose value does not change) for a disproportionately long period of time. Therefore, the results of the model simulation and the control group indeed conform to what would be expected from a reinforcement learner. This finding, on its own, however, cannot fully explain the risk sensitivity of even control participants, as they are not always risk averse. Indeed, in Niv et al. (2012), we compared this account for risk sensitivity to the alternative RSTD model, and showed that the latter model better explains choice behavior. The asymmetric learning in the RSTD model allows one to \u201ccorrect\u201d the imbalance inherent in reinforcement learning, and to achieve risk neutrality or even risk seeking behavior by learning more from positive prediction errors than from negative prediction errors. This is exactly what we show here for the DYT group, and it indeed is mirrored in the fit parameters of the model.
