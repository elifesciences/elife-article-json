The biology explaining highly variable shedding patterns, in an infected person over time, is poorly understood. We sampled the genital tract for HSV DNA at several time intervals and concurrently at multiple sites, and derived a spatial mathematical model to characterize dynamics of HSV-2 reactivation. The model reproduced heterogeneity in shedding episode duration and viral production, and predicted rapid early viral expansion, rapid late decay, and wide spatial dispersion of HSV replication during episodes. In simulations, HSV-2 spread locally within single ulcers to thousands of epithelial cells in &lt;12 hr, but host immune responses eliminated infected cells in &lt;24 hr; secondary ulcers formed following spatial propagation of cell-free HSV-2, allowing for episode prolongation. We conclude that HSV-2 infection is characterized by extremely rapid virological growth and containment at multiple contemporaneous sites within genital epithelium."

The biology explaining highly variable shedding patterns, in an infected person over time, is poorly understood. We sampled the genital tract for HSV DNA at several time intervals and concurrently at multiple sites, and derived a spatial mathematical model to characterize dynamics of HSV-2 reactivation. The model reproduced heterogeneity in shedding episode duration and viral production, and predicted rapid early viral expansion, rapid late decay, and wide spatial dispersion of HSV replication during episodes. In simulations, HSV-2 spread locally within single ulcers to thousands of epithelial cells in &lt;12 hr, but host immune responses eliminated infected cells in &lt;24 hr; secondary ulcers formed following spatial propagation of cell-free HSV-2, allowing for episode prolongation. We conclude that HSV-2 infection is characterized by extremely rapid virological growth and containment at multiple contemporaneous sites within genital epithelium."

Two well-known human viral infections are herpes simplex virus 1, which is responsible for most cold sores, and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), which causes most cases of genital herpes. The first signs of HSV-2 infection are genital lesions, which usually heal relatively quickly. However, the virus can also enter nerve cells, where it hides from the immune system and survives for the lifetime of the infected host. In a process that is not fully understood, the dormant viruses inside nerve cells periodically reactivate and are transported back to the genital tract where they can cause recurrent genital sores. HSV-2 also commonly replicates in genital skin when lesions are not present, and is efficiently transmitted to other individuals at these times."

However, the true battle between HSV-2 and its host occurs within genital tissues. HSV-2 lesions are clearly visible and it is therefore possible to precisely follow the number of viruses and the intensity of the host immune response as a function of time and position. Schiffer et al. follow this approach by examining the levels of HSV-2 DNA in the genital tracts of over 600 individuals, who were sampled at different time intervals and at multiple sites. Dramatic differences in the viral load and the density of CD8+ T cells, which are critical for controlling HSV-2, are observed across several millimeters of the skin. Viral load also varies dramatically over a few hours. These data are used to develop a mathematical model that characterizes the spatial dynamics of HSV-2 reactivation and suggests how the host immune system responds to reactivation."

However, the model developed by Schiffer et al. indicates that although viral infection can spread from a single skin cell to thousands of cells in 12 hr or so, the host immune cells typically clear all infected skin cells in under 24 hr. Episodes of viral shedding lasting &gt;3 days are predicted to occur due to viral seeding of adjacent regions of genital skin."

The rapid onset and localized clearance pattern suggests that viral elimination by skin-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is actually highly effective within single genital ulcers. This hypothesis represents an area of intense current investigation for clinicians, virologists, mathematical modelers, and immunologists."

For disseminated infections, sampling from blood may reflect true host\u2013pathogen dynamics due to homogeneous mixing of viruses and PBMCs, which originate from thousands of infectious foci. However, many infections are confined to small anatomic regions; localized host\u2013pathogen interactions within specific organ tissue constitutes the predominant site of pathogenesis, and measurements of viral replication and immune response are not accurately reflected in the blood compartment. Moreover, sampling of infected tissue often reveals that the density of virus and host immune cells differ enormously across small distances. Spatial features of infection are a critical, and relatively unexplored, component of viral dynamics."

Some episodes are associated with lesions, and prolonged viral production, while others are asymptomatic and brief (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mark et al., 2008</a>). Markedly different episodes occur within 5\u201310 days of each other, and viral levels fluctuate dramatically even within a single episode (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mark et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Schiffer et al., 2011</a>). At least 20% of episodes are notable for complex erratic viral trajectories, including re-expansion phases that represent failure of the immune system to contain replication (<a href=\"#bib28\">Schiffer et al., 2011</a>). Past modeling suggests that nearly constant reactivation of HSV in a small percentage of infected ganglionic neurons might account for high frequency of shedding episodes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Schiffer et al., 2009</a>). Animal and mathematical models predict that varying T-cell responses account for episode heterogeneity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gebhardt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Schiffer et al., 2010</a>). However, the field lacks hypotheses to address the complex morphology of prolonged viral shedding episodes."

We then designed a mathematical model as a tool to develop hypotheses that explain virological data from these cohorts. Model simulations suggest very rapid rates of HSV-2 replication and epidermal cell-to-cell spread. Yet, host containment of virus within a single focus of infection occurs in &lt;24 hr, necessitating seeding of adjacent regions to promote increased shedding."

This study revealed that HSV-2 is present across the entire genital tract during many episodes, although viral loads are highly variable over space and time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next demonstrated that viral re-expansion more commonly follows a period of decay during episodes with higher peak viral loads (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#box5\">Box 5</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>): if each peak during a prolonged shedding episodes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) represents viral production from a single focus of infection, then this implies that multiple spatially dispersed foci of replication (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) may occur due to seeding from areas with high levels of HSV-2 replication. Concurrent viral expansion and clearance in spatially distinct microregions could account for saw-tooth episodes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and viral migration to new regions might prolong episodes."

This dataset included 14,685 swabs and 1020 episodes of symptomatic and asymptomatic shedding (<a href=\"#bib28\">Schiffer et al., 2011</a>). Each episode was classified according to six features: duration, first, peak and last positive HSV genomic copy number, and initiation to peak and peak to termination slopes. The heterogeneity of each feature was captured using frequency histograms. Shedding episodes had highly variable duration (median days: 3; IQR: 1\u20138) and peak HSV DNA copy number (median log<sub>10</sub> copy number: 4.8; range: 2\u20139.2). Episode rate was 15.3/year, and per swab shedding frequency was 18% (\u223c3% of swabs contained 10<sup>2</sup>\u201310<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>3</sup>\u201310<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>\u201310<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>\u201310<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>\u201310<sup>7</sup>, and &gt;10<sup>7</sup> HSV DNA copies, respectively).

In addition, we have previously demonstrated that host T-cell responses in the area of genital lesions are highly localized to foci of viral replication (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zhu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2009</a>). To better classify T-cell heterogeneity over short distances, we performed biopsies in two patients from Cohort B immediately after lesion healing, and enumerated T-cell counts at the edge of an ulcer and 1 cm away. CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell densities in the genital skin were maximal at ulcer edge (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), and considerably lower in regions 1 cm away (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Even within a 1-mm biopsy, CD8+ T cells formed cluster-like aggregates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), suggesting that dynamical interactions between acquired immune cells and infected cells occur within tightly spaced microenvironments on a micrometer scale. We infer that individual ulcers, both microscopic and visible to the naked eye, may occur across a wide region of the genital tract during large outbreaks. While each ulcer and microulcer represent a site of intense interface between the virus and T cells, genital skin and mucosa between ulcers may be relatively quiescent."

After several iterations of model development failed to reproduce key features of our empirical dataset (\u2018Methods\u2019), we designed a spatial model that accounted for observed multiple concurrent foci of viral replication and immune response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We hypothesized that secondary ulcer formation in separate genital tract regions might occur via two mechanisms: release of HSV-2 from neuron endings may simultaneously occur in spatially distinct genital regions, or dense aggregates of cell-free particles within an ulcer may be locally infectious. Evidence for the latter hypothesis is tight correlation between episode peak copy number and probability of re-expansion in (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In addition, ulcers tend to be closely arrayed in space rather than widely dispersed across vulnerable regions in the genital tract. \u2018Kissing lesions\u2019, in which two ulcers form at the site of skin-to-skin contact, are a well-documented phenomenon (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). On the other hand, ulcers do not isolate within genital tract dermatomes as occurs with zoster reactivation. These observations suggest that local seeding from epithelial lesions may be responsible for many secondary ulcers."

Median time interval from becoming infected to infecting a new cell during the expansion phase of the 100 simulated episodes was 6.8 hr; median time from becoming infected to infecting a first surrounding cell was 59 min. This finding was surprising because in culture, HSV replication occurs within newly infected cells 4\u20136 hr post-infection (<a href=\"#bib23\">Roizman, 2007</a>).

We previously described an inverse relationship between HSV-2 episode severity and CD8+ T-cell density at the site of reactivation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Schiffer et al., 2010</a>). Our models predict that CD8+ T-cell density is an inverse correlate of the reproductive number (the number of cells infected by the initially infected cell) in a region.

Quantities are displayed according to a heat map adjacent to each spatial map. CD8+ T-cells expand rapidly at sites of episodes and then decay slowly over time, correlating with decreases and increases in reproductive number respectively. CD8+ T-cell and reproductive number spatial patterns cycle intermittently between a patchwork of heterogeneous density, broad low density, broad high density, and stark division between regions of high and low density. However, CD8+ T-cell density is virtually always high in at least some regions of the genital tract."

Simulations in which release occurred continuously at 82 HSV DNA particles per day into 1, 5, or 20 randomly selected regions resulted in a poor fit, due to a higher percentage of rapidly contained episodes and lower shedding rate (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). HSV-2 release into 50 geographically clustered regions within a confined area led to lower episode rate, less shedding, and poorer overall fit (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Predictors of elevated shedding rate included high neuronal release rate of HSV-2 DNA, high CD8+ T-cell replication rate, high regional co-dependence of CD8+ T-cell density, low HSV-2 DNA replication rate in skin cells, and low free-viral decay rate (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The finding that parameter levels which would appear to favor immune control in the mucosa, in fact correlate with higher long-term shedding rates, highlight the complex nonlinear dynamics of the spatial model; parameters that favor lower amounts of viral replication in the short term promote a higher proportion of episodes that are contained rapidly by the immune system; CD8+ T-cell expansion is less substantial during these brief episodes. Therefore, episodes are more commonly initiated at lower CD8+ T-cell densities. As a result, conditions of high CD8+ T-cell replication rate and low HSV-2 DNA replication rate in keratinocytes tend to favor both a higher proportion of very brief episodes (&lt;1 day) and more severe episodes that spread to multiple regions. The overall impact is to increase the shedding rate."

While we previously identified that a majority of HSV-2 reactivations last less than a day (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mark et al., 2008</a>), our current findings demonstrate that the cardinal feature of HSV-2 shedding is extraordinary episode heterogeneity. Longer and higher copy number episodes, which often manifest with genital lesions, are notable for multiple erratic peaks and wide viral dispersion. Viral loads are stable over periods of minutes but can change dramatically over hours. HSV-2 expansion and decay phases in mucosa are considerably more rapid and complex than those of HIV and hepatitis B, which have been characterized by sampling plasma (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ciupe et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ribeiro et al., 2010</a>). To explain these findings, we developed a stochastic spatial model that accurately reproduces empirically derived episode rate, duration, early viral expansion, late viral decay rate, and viral re-expansion frequency, as well as serpiginous spatial distribution of viral ulcers during recurrences."

While common wisdom is that extended viral replication occurs due to delayed arrival of acquired immune cells to the site of viral pathogenesis, our observations suggest that the immune response in microregions of replication is extraordinarily rapid. Most shedding episodes are contained within hours, when &lt;10 cells are infected (<a href=\"#bib25\">Schiffer et al., 2009</a>).

Thus, the spatial dynamic between virus and host defines episode morphology, and explains variability in shedding severity in an individual over periods of hours to weeks. These results suggest that studies of neutralizing and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity responses in localized mucosal areas are needed, and may explain why antiviral therapies which only impact intracellular replication and do not eliminate prolonged episodes."

A heterogeneous spatial array of immune cell densities at episode onset may determine the complex trajectory of a shedding episode, but these starting conditions cannot be directly measured in humans. It is similarly not possible to know in which specific microregion an episode will initiate. When we simulated the model over 30-day intervals typically used in our clinical studies, there was heterogeneity in the shedding rate based solely on randomness of episode initiation and high variability of episode duration. As such, we did not employ well-validated methods to infer parameter values by fitting to an individual's nonlinear shedding data (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ionides et al., 2006</a>)."

Surprisingly, while enhanced immune function in the form of lower viral replication rate or viral infectivity has the predictable short-term effect of limiting episode duration, the model suggests that sustained higher T-cell CD8+ replication rate and lower viral replication rate might counterintuitively increase long-term shedding rates: these parameter conditions favor a higher proportion of rapidly contained episodes, which in turn lowers the degree of CD8+ expansion. Therefore, the CD8+ density at episode initiation is on average lower, which also allows for more frequent widely dispersed episodes. Because the overall stability of parameter values over time cannot be easily measured, and because it is unknown if the model's parameters behave independently or in a colinear fashion, these sensitivity analysis predictions are relevant for hypothesis generation only. An area of prospective research is to identify which virological and immune factors account for phenotypic variability between infected persons."

The stochastic model and spatial shedding data both suggest that there is diffuse dispersal of virus from neurons into genital epithelia, rather than focal reactivations only within certain microregions. Such a strategy allows HSV-2 to randomly seed regions where immune cell decay from previous reactivations may allow a high-titer episode to initiate. This does not imply that latency is constantly bypassed within all neurons. Rather, we favor the idea that the vast majority of HSV within ganglia is maintained in a low copy number latent state (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Verjans et al., 2007</a>), while a minority reactivates albeit on a frequent basis.

Secondary seeding starts to predictably occur in modeled episodes when viral loads in a single ulcer exceed 10<sup>6</sup> HSV DNA copies. At this viral load, there are roughly 1000 dead cells, which is not enough for a microulcer to become visible to the naked eye. Therefore, HSV-2 can efficiently seed new regions across the genital tract leading to prolonged high copy number episodes even when shedding is not associated with lesions."

Hence, one limitation is that the model underestimates immunologic complexity. CD8+ T-cell response is assumed to be a surrogate of the entire immune response. Other key cellular subsets such as CD4+ lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells are not included. Lack of inclusion of innate immunity is another shortcoming as interferon type 1 is present early during lesions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Spruance et al., 1982</a>), and contributes to episode containment. Our model generates the hypothesis that chronic HSV-2 infection leads to a dynamic and spatially heterogeneous state of immune readiness.

The high number of fitting points in Cohort E and limited number of unknown parameters in our model decreases but does not eliminate the possibility that the model has multiple solutions. If swabs only remove a fixed proportion of free-viral DNA, then it is possible that we are underestimating the genital tract viral load. Based on the complex nature of the observational data, the use of a stochastic simulation model, and the inability to manipulate experimental conditions in our longitudinal studies of human shedding, our parameter values are estimates rather than precise solutions. We believe that the most critical hypotheses generated from this study are qualitative, and are relevant even if certain parameter values were not precisely identified."

Our model raises the possibility that by rapidly spreading between epidermal cells, HSV-2 ensures high viral production within a single ulcer, despite an intense local immune response. Cell-free HSV-2 may prolong episodes via spread to contiguous sites where immune cell density is lower. Each episode is contained by the mucosal immune system, and HSV-2 is often asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts. Viral strategies that lead to repeated episodes, rapid episode expansion and frequent re-expansion, allow for high shedding frequency, thereby enhancing transmission and disease manifestations. Interventions that target spread of virus between epidermal cells in a single ulcer, and to new regions of the genital tract, will be of value in controlling HSV-2 infection."

For each model fitting simulation, we assigned each of the summary measures (1. episode rate, 2. episode duration, 3. median initiation to peak slope, 4. median peak to termination slope, 5. first positive copy number of episodes, 6. last positive copy number of episodes, 7. peak positive copy number of episodes, and 8. quantitative shedding) a weighting factor to ensure that each summary measure carried an equivalent weight.

We observed that summed criteria scores &gt;1 resulted in significant disparity between the empirical and modeled data, while scores between 0.5 and 1 signified only moderate differences. Finally, if sums of the scores within a histogram amounted to &lt;0.5, then there was close similarity between the modeled data.

The HSV-2 replication cycle in the genital tract and immunologic response to HSV-2\u2013infected cells can be referenced to each of the model's parameters. The model assumes chronic infection. During the \u2018latent phase\u2019 of chronic genital HSV infection, virus is maintained in a dormant state in the sacral ganglia. During \u2018reactivation\u2019, virions are released from neuronal endings at the dermal\u2013epidermal junction at a certain rate (\u03d5). Released HSV-2 survives in the genital tract for a defined duration (1/<i>c</i>), during which time it can transfer from neurons and infect local epithelial cells. Viral infectivity (1/[\u03b2<sub>i</sub> \u00d7 S]) is roughly defined as the number of viruses that are needed to infect one epithelial cell per day assuming the constant presence of viruses and a full complement of susceptible cells."

In one sense, target cells appear to be limitless in the genital tract: visualization of skin during lesions reveals a high ratio of uninfected to infected keratinocytes in genital skin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>); even in severely immunocompromised hosts with severe infections, ulcers never involve the entire genital tract and do not spread more than a few centimeters down the thigh or up the stomach or back. Yet, spread of virus from the cytosol of one cell to another is constrained by the number of cellular contacts of an infected cell: as an ulcer spreads in radius, an increasing proportion cells in contact with an infected cell are already infected. This effect may decrease average infectivity of an infected cell as ulcer radius expands. Therefore, the infectivity term does decrease with time in our model according to number of cells that remain susceptible."

Model 3 consisted of 300 possible regions of infection, linked by the ability of neurons to randomly release virus into any of the 300 regions. Moreover, we allowed formation of new plaques within other regions by cell-free particles. Cell-free particles in the model were assigned a new infectivity parameter (\u03b2<sub>e</sub>). In this model, there was no spatial constraint of virus, such that HSV from one region could initiate new sites of replication in the 299 other regions. We included parameter (\u03b5) to account for delay in viral production within secondary plaques after seeding. This parameter was estimated based on simple experiments that we conducted with a red fluorescent protein-VP26 HSV construct that turns cells red following viral replication and encapsidation of viral DNA (VP 26 is a late capsid protein). Individual cells turn red approximately 12\u201324 hr after very low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.001) of Vero cells, which are a cell line of monkey kidney epithelial cells that are permissive for HSV entry, replication, and spread. Therefore, \u03b5 was assigned an initial value range of 0.5\u20131. Model 3 produced longer episodes in general than Model 2, and successfully created episodes with re-expansion. Nevertheless, episodes were too short in duration to reproduce the frequency histogram for episode duration (<a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>)."

After a single cycle through all parameter sets, several more cycles were performed with parameter ranges re-expanded around revised best parameter values.

First, we explored the short-term effects of model parameter values on shedding episode characteristics. As in our past models, CD8+ T-cell density at the initial reactivation site was the critical driver of peak episode viral load and duration of the episode (Schiffer et al., 2011; Schiffer et al., 2011). However, the fact that this value was not completely predictive highlights the importance of stochastic effects on short-term viral trends in our spatial model. Increased viral replication rate in epidermal cells modestly enhanced episode duration and viral production, while increased viral infectivity modestly prolonged episode duration. These results are summarized in the Results section and Table 3, and their biologic significance is reviewed in an updated Discussion."

In the 500 10-year Monte Carlo simulations, no single model parameter pertaining to mucosal biology was completely predictive of shedding rate or episode rate. Surprisingly, higher CD8+ T-cell expansion rates correlated with higher shedding rate, while lower epidermal production rate of HSV-2, perhaps mediated by increased force of innate immunity, also correlated with higher shedding rate."

Under simulated conditions favoring lower capacity for short-term viral production in mucosa (lower viral replication rate in epidermal cells or higher CD8+ replication rate), a higher proportion of simulated episodes were rapidly contained in less than a day: these episodes typically involved &lt;10 infected cells and were cleared in &lt;24 hr, prior to the need for T-cell reconstitution. As a result of this general pattern, CD8+ T-cells replenished less frequently and the typical duration between episodes of &gt;24 hr increased. Due to more prolonged phases of CD8+ T-cell decay, the average CD8+ T-cell density at the onset of severe episodes was lower. Therefore, under conditions of sustained lower viral replication rate in epidermal cells and/or higher CD8+ replication rate, while simulated episodes of &lt;1 day were more common, episodes of &gt;10 days were also more common: parameter conditions that seemingly would promote less shedding in fact predicted slightly higher overall shedding rates. This more prolonged decay phase of CD8+ T-cells between episodes may be considered a form of T-cell exhaustion."

This finding may represent an artifact of overlapping shedding episode initiations within different spatial regions. In fact, neither of these parameters has any effect on the rate of shedding episode <i>initiation</i> within mucosa: shedding episode initiation rate is determined only by the rate of release of HSV-2 from neurons as well as viral infectivity. Rather, under these low replication conditions, episodes may be less likely to initiate when another episode is already ongoing. Therefore, a higher number of episode initiations are detected rather than being masked by an ongoing reactivation. These predictions highlight the incredible complexity of virus host interplay within mucosa when spatial features of pathogenesis are considered."

First, feasible probability density functions for many of the model's parameters can only be estimated. In addition, it is unknown whether our model's parameters are independent or collinear. For instance, some investigators believe that CD8+ T-cells are vital for controlling the kinetics of HSV-2 release within ganglia (Khanna, 2003). Therefore, viral release rate from neurons and CD8+ expansion rate in periphery may be co-dependent. There is no available data to support or refute this idea. We therefore emphasize that sensitivity analysis results are hypothesis generating and raise several fruitful avenues for future research."

If viral release from neurons was allowed in a higher percentage of micro-regions, but was limited to one geographic sector of the genital tract, then model fit was less robust as well. We conclude based on these analyses, as well as data in Figure 2a, which shows brief HSV-2 reactivations in spatially distinct regions, that HSV release from neurons is likely to consist of highly frequent and widely spatially dispersed release of small amounts of viral genomes. This viral strategy allows regions with low CD8+ densities and high viral growth potential to be periodically seeded, promoting larger outbreaks."

For each episode, the CD8+ T-cell density in the initiating region was evaluated as a possible exposure variable for episode duration and peak copy number. Moreover, parameter values of viral replication and immune response were chosen randomly from the probability density functions described above."

Coital transmission can occur when shedding is either symptomatic or asymptomatic. In model simulations, seeding of adjacent regions can occur when the viral load in a single region is \u223c10<sup>6</sup> HSV DNA copies, which corresponds with a number of killed cells that is too low to become visible to the human eye. This explains why episodes with reasonably high viral loads and prolonged duration, but no visible lesions, are quite common. We conclude that the phenomenon of secondary seeding is important for prolonging both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes, and is therefore likely to enhance transmission under both circumstances."
