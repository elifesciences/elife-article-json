Although trophallaxis is widely considered a food-sharing mechanism, we hypothesized that endogenous components of this fluid might underlie a novel means of chemical communication between colony members. Through protein and small-molecule mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, we found that trophallactic fluid in the ant <i>Camponotus floridanus</i> contains a set of specific digestion- and non-digestion related proteins, as well as hydrocarbons, microRNAs, and a key developmental regulator, juvenile hormone. When <i>C. floridanus</i> workers\u2019 food was supplemented with this hormone, the larvae they reared via trophallaxis were twice as likely to complete metamorphosis and became larger workers. Comparison of trophallactic fluid proteins across social insect species revealed that many are regulators of growth, development and behavioral maturation. These results suggest that trophallaxis plays previously unsuspected roles in communication and enables communal control of colony phenotypes."

Although trophallaxis is widely considered a food-sharing mechanism, we hypothesized that endogenous components of this fluid might underlie a novel means of chemical communication between colony members. Through protein and small-molecule mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, we found that trophallactic fluid in the ant <i>Camponotus floridanus</i> contains a set of specific digestion- and non-digestion related proteins, as well as hydrocarbons, microRNAs, and a key developmental regulator, juvenile hormone. When <i>C. floridanus</i> workers\u2019 food was supplemented with this hormone, the larvae they reared via trophallaxis were twice as likely to complete metamorphosis and became larger workers. Comparison of trophallactic fluid proteins across social insect species revealed that many are regulators of growth, development and behavioral maturation. These results suggest that trophallaxis plays previously unsuspected roles in communication and enables communal control of colony phenotypes."

Adding juvenile hormone to the food that adult ants pass to the larvae made it twice as likely that the larvae would survive to reach adulthood.

Colonies of ants, bees and termites are self-organized systems that rely on a set of simple signals to coordinate the development and behavior of individual members (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bonabeau et al., 1997</a>). While colony-level phenotypes may arise simply from the independent behavior of individuals with similar response thresholds, many group decisions require communication between members of a colony (<a href=\"#bib63\">LeBoeuf and Grozinger, 2014</a>). In ants, three principal means of communication have been described: pheromonal, acoustic, and tactile (<a href=\"#bib49\">H\u00f6lldobler and Wilson, 1990</a>). Pheromones, produced by a variety of glands, impart diverse information, including nestmate identity and environmental dangers. Acoustic communication, through substrate vibration or the rubbing of specific body parts against one another, often conveys alarm signals. Tactile communication encompasses many behaviors, from allo-grooming and antennation to the grabbing and pulling of another ant\u2019s mandibles for recruitment to a new nest site or resource."

The primary function of trophallaxis is considered to be the exchange of food, as exemplified by the transfer of nutrients from foragers to nurses and from nurses to larvae (<a href=\"#bib121\">Wilson and Eisner, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Buffin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cassill and Tschinkel, 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Wheeler, 1918</a>, Wheeler,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib117\">1986</a>).

Furthermore, adult ants have been suggested to use a combination of trophallaxis and allo-grooming to share cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) which are important in providing a specific \u2018colony odor\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Boulay et al., 2000a</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Soroker et al., 1995</a>), although the presence of CHCs in trophallactic fluid has not been directly demonstrated. Given these food-independent trophallaxis events, and the potential of this behavior to permit both \u2018private\u2019 inter-individual chemical exchange as well as rapid distribution of fluids over the social network of a colony, we tested the hypothesis that trophallaxis serves as an additional means of chemical communication and/or manipulation. To identify the endogenous molecules exchanged during this behavior, we used mass-spectrometry and RNA sequencing to characterize the contents of trophallactic fluid, and identified many growth-related proteins, CHCs, small RNAs, and the insect developmental regulator, juvenile hormone. We also obtained evidence that some components of trophallactic fluid can be modulated by social environment, and may influence larval development."

We focused on the Florida carpenter ant, <i>Camponotus floridanus</i>, which is a large species whose genome has been sequenced (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bonasio et al., 2010</a>). We first attempted to collect fluid from unmanipulated pairs of workers engaged in trophallaxis, but it was impossible to predict when trophallaxis would occur, and events were usually too brief to collect the fluid being exchanged. We found that after workers were starved and isolated from their colony, then fed a 25% sucrose solution and promptly reunited with a similarly conditioned nestmate, approximately half of such pairs displayed trophallaxis within the first minute of reunion (as observed previously [<a href=\"#bib12\">Boulay et al., 2000a</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Dahbi et al., 1999</a>]), and were more likely to remain engaged in this behavior for many seconds or even minutes. Under these conditions, it was sometimes possible to collect small quantities of fluid from the visible droplet between their mouthparts (referred to as \u2018voluntary\u2019 samples). However, even under these conditions, trophallaxis was easily interrupted, making this mode of collection extremely low-yield."

Social isolation affected the ratios of proteins in TF, with five of the top 40 proteins in TF becoming significantly less abundant and one more abundant when ants were socially isolated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> for names and IDs).

However, it remains unclear if CHCs are exchanged principally by trophallaxis, or through other mechanisms such as allo-grooming and contact with the nest substrate (<a href=\"#bib12\">Boulay et al., 2000a</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Soroker et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bos et al., 2011</a>). We therefore investigated whether CHCs are present in TF, and how they relate to those present on the cuticle.

All the highly abundant hydrocarbons in TF (marked in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) were also present on the cuticle of the workers analyzed, supporting the potential for trophallaxis to mediate inter-individual CHC exchange. Moreover, there was a significantly greater (t-test, p&lt;0.0003) similarity across colonies in the hydrocarbon profiles of TF than hydrocarbon profiles of the cuticle (similarity was measured by cross-correlation between GC-MS profiles, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013E</a>).

If an average worker has approximately 0.34 \u03bcL of TF in her crop at a given time (as measured in our initial experiments; see above), this corresponds to a dose of approximately 31 pg of JH. The analysis of 35 larvae collected midway through development (i.e., third instar out of four worker instars, mean \u00b1 SD: 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 mm long and 1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12 mm wide) revealed that they contained 100\u2013700 pg of JH (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, the amount of JH received during an average trophallaxis event amounts to 5\u201331% of the JH content of a third instar larva. While it is difficult to determine how much of the JH fed to larvae remains in the larval digestive tract, these results indicate that there is potentially sufficient JH in a single trophallaxis-mediated feeding to shift the titer of a recipient larva."

We created groups of 25\u201330 workers and allowed them to each rear 5\u201310 larvae to pupation, in the presence of food and sucrose solution that was supplemented with either JH or only a solvent. Larvae reared by JH-supplemented workers grew into larger adults than those reared by solvent-supplemented controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, GLMM, p&lt;9.01e<sup>\u221206</sup>). Moreover, larvae reared by JH-supplemented caretakers were twice as likely to successfully undergo metamorphosis relative to controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, binomial GLMM, p&lt;7.39e<sup>\u221206</sup>). These results are consistent with previous studies in other species of ants and bees using methoprene (a non-hydrolyzable JH analog), whose external provision to the colony can lead to larvae developing into larger workers and even queens (<a href=\"#bib81\">Nijhout and Wheeler, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Libbrecht et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib116\">Wheeler and Nijhout, 1981</a>)."

Most of these appear to have functions related to digestion, except for apolipophorin, which is involved in lipid/nutrient transport (<a href=\"#bib58\">Kutty et al., 1996</a>). For ortholog groups found in the TF of the three ant species, most were also digestion-related with the notable exception of CREG1, a secreted glycoprotein that has been implicated in cell growth control (<a href=\"#bib29\">Di Bacco et al., 2003</a>) and insect JH response (<a href=\"#bib65\">Li Y et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barchuk et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib124\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). Genus- and species-specific proteins were frequently associated with growth or developmental roles. For example, <i>A. mellifera</i> TF contained 12 distinct major royal jelly proteins (MRJP),\u00a0which\u00a0are thought to be involved in nutrient storage and developmental fate determination (<a href=\"#bib31\">Drapeau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kamakura, 2011</a>), while <i>S. invicta</i> TF contained a highly abundant JH-binding protein and a vitellogenin. The two <i>Camponotus</i> species shared many orthologous groups, consistent with their close phylogenetic relationship. Five of the seven JHE/Est-6 proteins found\u00a0by\u00a0Scaffold in <i>C. floridanus</i> TF also had orthologs present in <i>C. fellah</i> TF. Additionally, these two species shared a MRJP/Yellow homolog, and an NPC2-related protein, which, in <i>D. melanogaster</i>, is involved in sterol binding and ecdysteroid biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Huang et al., 2007</a>). Finally, 26 ortholog groups contained\u00a0representatives\u00a0from multiple species, but not the most closely related ones (<i>e.g., A. mellifera</i> and <i>S. invicta,</i> or <i>S. invicta</i> and only one of the two <i>Camponotus</i> species). One-third of these were associated with growth and developmental processes (e.g., three hexamerins, two MRJP/yellow proteins, imaginal disc growth factor 4, vitellogenin-like Vhdl and an additional NPC2). Together these analyses indicate that approximately half of all TF protein ortholog groups appear to be digestion-related, consistent with TF being composed of the contents of the foregut. However, many TF proteins have putative roles in growth, nutrient storage, or the metabolism and transport of JH, vitellogenin or ecdysone."

These findings suggest that trophallaxis underlies a private communication mechanism that can have multiple phenotypic consequences. More generally, our observations open the possibility that exchange of oral fluids (e.g., saliva) in other animals might also serve functions not previously suspected (<a href=\"#bib47\">Humphrey and Williamson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Ribeiro et al., 1995</a>)."

Without explicitly sampling the contents of the crop, it is not possible to differentiate between components passed by trophallaxis or by physical contact. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that TF contains endogenous long-chain hydrocarbons. Interestingly, we found differences in the hydrocarbon profiles of the TF and the cuticle of the same ants, suggesting the existence of other processes regulating the relative proportion of CHCs and/or additional sources of these compounds. Further work manipulating and comparing hydrocarbon profiles of TF and cuticle of multiple individual ants within the same colony is necessary to understand the impact of the observed variation in TF and cuticular hydrocarbons."

Their presence may simply reflect a few cells being sloughed from the lumen of the foregut, or could be indicative of a defense process termed ETosis, whereby chromatin is released from the nuclei of inflammatory cells to form extracellular traps that kill pathogenic microbes (<a href=\"#bib92\">Robb et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Brinkmann et al., 2004</a>)."

Previous work has shown that the developmental fate of larvae and the process of caste determination in various ant and bee species can be influenced by treating colony members with JH or JH analogs (<a href=\"#bib117\">Wheeler, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib116\">Wheeler and Nijhout, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Cnaani et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Cnaani et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Rajakumar et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, in some species, workers play an important role in regulating caste determination (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kamakura, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Linksvayer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Villalta et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Mutti et al., 2011</a>) but it is unknown how workers might influence the JH titers of larvae. Our finding that TF contains JH raises the possibility of trophallaxis as a direct means by which larval hormone levels and developmental trajectories can be manipulated. This type of mechanism has some precedent: honey bee workers bias larval development toward queens by feeding them\u00a0royal jelly, an effect that might be mediated by MRJPs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kamakura, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Buttstedt et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Kucharski et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Kamakura, 2016</a>). Across the TF of four species of social insect, we have found diverse molecules intimately involved in insect growth regulation: JH, JHE, JH-binding protein, vitellogenin, hexamerin, apolipophorin, and MRJPs. Several of the proteins and microRNAs identified in ant and bee TF are also found in royal and worker jelly (<a href=\"#bib42\">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib124\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). Notably, there are also some similarities between proteins in social insect TF and mammalian milk (<a href=\"#bib123\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>), such as the cell growth regulator CREG1. The between-genera variation in the most abundant growth-related proteins (e.g., MRJPs in honey bee, JH-binding protein and hexamerins in fire ant, and JHEs in <i>Camponotus</i>) indicates that there might be multiple evolutionary origins and/or rapid divergence in trophallaxis-based signals potentially influencing larval growth."

Many non-food-derived components in TF are likely to be either directly deposited into the alimentary canal: over two-thirds of the proteins present in TF had a predicted signal peptide suggesting that they are probably secreted by the cells lining the foregut or glands connected to the alimentary canal (e.g., postpharyngeal, labial, mandibular, salivary glands). Additionally, TF molecules are likely to be acquired by transfer among nestmates through licking, grooming, and trophallaxis. For example, CHCs are produced by oenocytes, transmitted to the cuticle, ingested, and sequestered in the postpharyngeal gland (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">van Zweden and d\u2019Ettorre, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Soroker and Hefetz, 2000</a>).

First, this might reflect a regulatory mechanism for JH levels at the individual and colony levels. Many biological systems use such negative feedback mechanisms to buffer signals and enable rapid responses to environmental change (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alon, 2007</a>). Alternatively, these enzymes may have evolved a different function along with their novel localization in TF. In other insects JHE-related enzymes are typically expressed in the fat body and circulate in the hemolymph (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hammock et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Ward et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Campbell et al., 1998</a>)., The expansion of JHE-like proteins in <i>C. floridanus</i> was accompanied by a high specificity in their localization, with two (E2AM67, E2AM68) being present exclusively in the hemolymph, and four (E2ANU0, E2AI90, E2AJM0, E2AJL9) exclusively in TF. This coexistence of JH and JHEs reveals a striking parallel with the constituents of a different socially\u00a0exchanged fluid in <i>D. melanogaster. Drosophila</i> Est-6 is highly abundant in seminal fluid, together with its presumed substrate, the male-specific pheromone 11<i>-cis</i>-vaccenyl acetate (cVA). cVA has multiple roles in influencing sexual and aggressive interactions and its transfer to females during copulation potently diminishes her attractiveness to future potential mates (<a href=\"#bib86\">Poiani, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Chertemps et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Costa, 1989</a>)."

Considering that most, if not all, individuals in a colony must share food through trophallaxis, it will also be of interest to understand if and how individual-, or caste-specific TF-based information signals emerge. Recent work on trophallaxis networks (<a href=\"#bib40\">Greenwald et al., 2015</a>) and interaction networks (<a href=\"#bib76\">Mersch et al., 2013</a>), indicate that ants preferentially interact with others of similar behavioral type (e.g., nurses with nurses, and foragers with foragers). This raises the possibility that different pools of TF with different qualities exist. A key challenge will be to develop specific genetic and/or pharmacological tools to test the biological relevance of molecules transmitted by trophallaxis."

Further purification of cDNA was by centrifugation through Spin-X 0.22 \u03bcm cellulose acetate filter columns (Corning Costar, Corning, NY) followed by ethanol precipitation. Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 Sequencer (Illumina). Small RNA sequencing data are available through SRA database at SRP082161."

A typical GC-MS chromatogram (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) reveals the complexity of the TF sample. The workflow described here was systematically used to characterize the linear and branched hydrocarbons present in TF samples summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. The parent ion was first determined for each peak after background subtraction. Ambiguities remained in some cases due to the low intensity or absence of the molecular ion. In order to determine the number of ramifications for alkanes and alkenes, we examined the distribution of intensities of all fragment ions in the spectrum. From the experimental mass spectrum (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>), the intensity of all fragment ions was extracted and fitted with an exponential decay function (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E</a>). <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> clearly shows two different resulting EI mass spectra profiles: on the left a linear alkane corresponding to n-hexacosane (Rt\u00a0=\u00a034.69 min and MF C<sub>26</sub>H<sub>54</sub>); on the right, a ramified structure most likely corresponding to 9,20-Dimethyl nonacosane (Rt\u00a0=\u00a043.29 min and MF C<sub>31</sub>H<sub>64</sub>) with fragment ions 141 (loss of 295) and 309 (loss of 127) from the molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 436. This demonstrates that extracting and fitting the fragment profile provides a reliable method, not only to discriminate between linear and branched hydrocarbons, but also to determine the number of ramifications.

Since most branched alkanes are not present in the main libraries of EI mass spectra, a predicted RI was determined depending on: (i) the number of carbons and (ii) the number of ramifications. Based on RI values (for similar GC stationary phase) given in the NIST Chemistry WebBook (<a href=\"#bib69\">Linstrom et al., 2000</a>) for known alkanes from C15 to C38, six different curves of RI vs. number of carbons were constructed for each class of alkane, from linear to pentamethylated alkanes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). For the same number of carbons and ramifications, an average value of RI was calculated. For example, the RI value given for C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>52</sub> and two ramifications (RI\u00a0=\u00a02409) is the average of 3,(7/9/11/13)-dimethyltricosane (RI\u00a0=\u00a02405), 3,(3/5)-dimethyltricosane (RI\u00a0=\u00a02444) and 5,(9/11)-dimethyltricosane (RI\u00a0=\u00a02380) values listed in the NIST Chemistry WebBook. The curve corresponding to linear alkanes was strictly superimposed with the one obtained in our conditions with a standard mixture of C8-C40 alkanes.

This biological sample was added to a 1:1 mixture of isooctane and methanol, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged for 7 min at maximum speed. Avoiding the boundary between phases, the majority of the isooctane layer and the methanol layer were removed separately, combined and stored at \u201380\u00b0C until analysis. Before analysis, 50% acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was added. Prior to purification, farnesol (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added to each sample to serve as an internal standard. Samples were extracted three times with hexane (HPLC grade). The hexane fractions were recombined in a clean borosilicate glass vial and dried by vacuum centrifugation. JH III was quantified using the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) method of (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bergot et al., 1981</a>) as modi\ufb01ed by (<a href=\"#bib99\">Shu et al., 1997</a>) and (<a href=\"#bib15\">Brent and Vargo, 2003</a>). The residue was washed out of the vials with three rinses of hexane and added to borosilicate glass columns filled with aluminum oxide. In order to filter out contaminants, samples were eluted through the columns successively with hexane, 10% ethyl ether\u2013hexane and 30% ethyl ether\u2013hexane. After drying, samples were derivatized by heating at 60\u00b0C for 20 min in a solution of methyl-d alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich) and trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Samples were dried down, resuspended in hexane, and again eluted through aluminum oxide columns. Non-derivatized components were removed with 30% ethyl ether. The JH derivative was collected into new vials by addition of 50% ethyl-acetate\u2013hexane. After drying, the sample was resuspended in hexane. Samples were then analyzed using an HP 7890A Series GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a 30 m x 0.25 mm Zebron ZB-WAX column (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) coupled to an HP 5975C inert mass selective detector. Helium was used as a carrier gas. JH form was confirmed by first running test samples in SCAN mode for known signatures of JH 0, JH I, JH II, JH III and JH III ethyl; JH III was confirmed as the primary endogenous form in this species. Subsequent samples were analyzed using the MS SIM mode, monitoring at m/z 76 and 225 to ensure specificity for the d<sub>3</sub>-methoxyhydrin derivative of JH III. Total abundance was quantified against a standard curve of derivatized JH III, and adjusted for the starting volume of TF. The detection limit of the assay is approximately one pg."

Heatmap visualization without clustering was done in MATLAB (2012b, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622\">SCR_001622</a>). For experiments in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, the number of colonies and number of replicates or ants per colony were determined by both preliminary trials to assess sample variation and the health/abundance of the <i>C. floridanus</i> ant colonies available in the lab. Hydrocarbon GC-MS traces were analyzed in MATLAB normalizing the abundance (area under the\u00a0curve) of each point by maximum and minimum value within the CHC retention time window. Peaks were found using \u2018findpeaks\u2019 with a lower threshold abundance of 7% of the total abundance for that sample. To compare across samples, peaks were filtering into 0.03 min bins by retention time. Cross-correlation was computed using the \u2018xcorr\u2019 function. For long-term development experiments, the number of same-staged larvae per colony was the limiting factor for the number of replicates per experiment. Because of this limitation, the long-term development experiment testing the effect of JH was fully repeated three times. Colonies were hibernated approximately 1 month prior to each of these experiments to maximize number of same-staged brood. General linear mixed models (GLMM) were used so that colony, replicate and experiment could be considered as random factors. Models were done in R using \u2018lmer\u2019 and \u2018glmer\u2019 functions of the lme4 package, and p values were calculated with the \u2018lmerTest\u2019 package in R.

This is not very permeable to large molecules such as proteins, which raises a dual question: How are these proteins sequestered (if at all) to the crop of the donor, and how they are transferred from the crop to the hemolymph of the recipient.

While the information is important I am not sure whether it fits the scope of <i>eLife</i> or its general readers. Except for a small experiment of feeding JH, there is little attempt to examine the possible role or effect of the plethora of chemicals found in the trophallactic fluid. Neither have they attempted to address this question in the Discussion, which is surprisingly short considering the large amount of data presented."

Again, there is no attempt to explain this phenomenon. I also doubt whether this JH may play a role in larval fate (size, length of the install etc.). Generally, due to its importance in many processes both in the larvae and adults, its titer is highly regulated. I cannot imagine that JH that reach the crop stays as is and transfer to the hemolymph. Generally it is bound to some kind of lipophorin that not only protects it from degradation but also facilitate its transport in the mostly hydrophilic milieu of the body fluids. Applying exogenous JH may have altered the developmental process of the larvae, but then it requires that workers control the level of JH in their crop if they wish to control larval size."

The authors furthermore show that (as suggested but never shown before) trophallaxis fluid contains cuticular hydrocarbons that are involved in forming the colony-specific olfactory/gustatory profile. This information is new and of high interest, as it brings us closer to the understanding on how e.g. the development of different castes or worker sizes is organised on the colony level. All results are discussed appropriately. The experiments are precisely designed and conducted carefully and it is admirable that the authors managed to milk fluid from freely trophalacting ants. Although the major part of the analysis was done with forced-milked fluids, the controls showing no difference between the two milking strategies are convincing. Being no chemist I appreciate how well the chemical results (regarding presence or absence, or specific amounts of numerous identified substances) are presented in the figures.

Generally, due to its importance in many processes both in the larvae and adults, its titer is highly regulated. I cannot imagine that JH that reach the crop stays as is and transfer to the hemolymph. Generally it is bound to some kind of lipophorin that not only protects it from degradation but also facilitate its transport in the mostly hydrophilic milieu of the body fluids. Applying exogenous JH may have altered the developmental process of the larvae, but then it requires that workers control the level of JH in their crop if they wish to control larval size.</i> "
