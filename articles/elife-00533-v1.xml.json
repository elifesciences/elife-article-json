And a planarian\u2014a type of flatworm\u2014can re-grow an entire head following decapitation. But how does such regeneration occur in these animals? And why are mammals and many other species, both vertebrates and invertebrates, found wanting in this regard? The problem is particularly vexing when one considers that regeneration is triggered by wounding; why is it that most, if not all, animals can heal their wounds, but only a few can regenerate body parts lost to such injuries? These questions have puzzled thinkers, naturalists and scientists for millennia. Over the past decade, however, it has become possible both to explore the influence of specific genes on the mechanisms that underpin regeneration, and to begin to answer these long-standing questions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">S\u00e1nchez Alvarado and Tsonis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</a>)."

Over the past 30 years, a number of highly conserved signalling pathways have been identified in embryonic development and, more recently, researchers have investigated whether these pathways also contribute to adult developmental processes, such as regeneration. The Wnt-signalling pathway, for example, has long been known for its multiple roles in embryogenesis. Moreover, this pathway is now also thought to be implicated in the regulation of wound responses and regenerative mechanisms across the animal kingdom, from simple animals such as Hydra (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hobmayer et al., 2000</a>) to more complex organisms such as planarians (<a href=\"#bib4\">Gurley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</a>), zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib11\">Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007</a>) and mammals (<a href=\"#bib1\">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</a>)."

To date, this pathway has been implicated primarily in patterning the dorsoventral axis during development (that is, establishing the \u2018front\u2019 and \u2018back\u2019 of animals) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Moustakas and Heldin, 2009</a>). Wounded planarians displayed increased expression of genes called <i>activin-2</i> and <i>follistatin.</i> Activin is a protein complex that binds to a receptor to activate the TGF-\u03b2 signalling cascade, whereas Follistatin is an inhibitor protein that prevents Activin from binding to its receptor."

In planarians that had experienced amputation, the inhibition of <i>follistatin</i>\u2014which leaves <i>activin</i> free to activate the TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathway\u2014blocked key cellular and tissue remodelling events associated with tissue loss, and prevented regeneration. Interestingly, this is the opposite of what has been reported for vertebrates, in which TGF-\u03b2 signalling promotes rather than suppresses regeneration."

Consistent with this hypothesis, Gavi\u00f1o and colleagues observed that <i>follistatin</i> is expressed for longer times at wounds with tissue loss than at those without, and that expression levels correlate with the amount of tissue that has been removed. These observations support a model in which injury induces both <i>follistatin</i> and <i>activin</i> expression, with <i>follistatin</i> expression regulated by the degree of tissue loss. In this model, <i>activin</i> inhibits the regenerative response; after a major injury, however, high levels of <i>follistatin</i> overcome the effects of Activin and promote regeneration. The behaviour of these genes provides an interesting paradigm in which to study the regulation of promoters in general and, in particular, to explore how the seemingly quantitative regulation of the <i>follistatin</i> promoter in planarians is related to their responses when they are wounded."

In fact, a recent article by Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark reports that <i>follistatin</i> acts in combination with <i>notum</i> (an antagonist of the Wnt pathway) to reestablish a signalling center that may direct cells towards specific fates (<a href=\"#bib8\">Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark, 2013</a>). Moreover, there are likely to be other as yet unidentified \u2018missing tissue\u2019 signals that are produced in response to amputation. The fact that stem cells still migrate to sites of injury in planarians in which <i>follistatin</i> has been targeted via RNAi clearly supports the existence of regenerative factors that are independent of the Follistatin-mediated inhibition of Activin. I suspect that the identification and characterization of these agents will keep biologists busy for the foreseeable future. Such factors, whatever their nature, will inform us about the processes unleashed by wounding that elicit healing and/or regeneration. Their identification will also shed light on why some organisms are much more adroit at regeneration than others. This, in turn, may help identify strategies to extend regenerative powers to tissues of medical importance that lacking in this property."
