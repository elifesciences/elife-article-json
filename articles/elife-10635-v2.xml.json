Munc13s are essential for SV docking and priming, and we systematically analyzed their role in LDCV exocytosis using chromaffin cells lacking individual isoforms. We show that particularly Munc13-2 plays a fundamental role in LDCV exocytosis, but in contrast to synapses lacking Munc13s, the corresponding chromaffin cells do not exhibit a vesicle docking defect. We further demonstrate that ubMunc13-2 and Munc13-1 confer Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent LDCV priming with similar affinities, but distinct kinetics. Using a mathematical model, we identify an early LDCV priming step that is strongly dependent upon Munc13s. Our data demonstrate that the molecular steps of SV and LDCV priming are very similar while SV and LDCV docking mechanisms are distinct."

Munc13s are essential for SV docking and priming, and we systematically analyzed their role in LDCV exocytosis using chromaffin cells lacking individual isoforms. We show that particularly Munc13-2 plays a fundamental role in LDCV exocytosis, but in contrast to synapses lacking Munc13s, the corresponding chromaffin cells do not exhibit a vesicle docking defect. We further demonstrate that ubMunc13-2 and Munc13-1 confer Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent LDCV priming with similar affinities, but distinct kinetics. Using a mathematical model, we identify an early LDCV priming step that is strongly dependent upon Munc13s. Our data demonstrate that the molecular steps of SV and LDCV priming are very similar while SV and LDCV docking mechanisms are distinct."

In synaptic vesicles, both of these processes \u2013 physical membrane attachment and priming \u2013 appear to occur in a single step that requires a family of proteins called the Munc13 proteins. Here, Man et al. investigate whether the Munc13 proteins are also essential for LDCV exocytosis in the chromaffin cells of mice. The experiments reveal that in contrast to synaptic vesicles, the initial binding of LDCVs to membranes does not require Munc13 proteins. However, the loss of one member of the family called Munc13-2 dramatically reduces the fusion of LDCVs with the membrane of chromaffin cells. Further experiments reveal that different Munc13 proteins differ in their ability to drive the exocytosis of LDCVs."

Fitting a sum of three exponentials to the exocytotic burst of each individual trace identifies the amplitudes and time constants of release, which are generally interpreted as two kinetically distinct vesicle pools, the fast burst as the Readily-Releasable Pool (RRP), and the slow burst as the Slowly-Releasable Pool (SRP) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sorensen et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Voets, 2000</a>). However, as will be discussed later, the slow burst component may in fact not be a releasable pool, but instead represent the conversion from a Non-Releasable Pool (NRP), to the RRP (<a href=\"#bib78\">Walter et al., 2013</a>). The rate of sustained release was measured as a linear component after the exocytotic burst, and reflects the ongoing recruitment of LDCVs into the NRP/SRP and RRP. Deletion of Munc13-1 (<i>Unc13a</i>), the major Munc13 isoform in SV exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Augustin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</a>), did not markedly alter LDCV exocytosis compared to WT littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>), nor did it affect the kinetics of the exocytotic burst (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

To this end, we overexpressed Munc13-1, ubMunc13-2, Baiap3, and its closest relative Munc13-4 using Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) in <i>Unc13a</i><sup>KO</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> cells. Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 were expressed as EGFP fusion constructs whose functions are identical to those of the respective WT proteins (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rosenmund et al., 2002</a>), whereas Baiap3 and Munc13-4 were expressed as internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-EGFP constructs, to avoid possible confounding effects of a fusion tag. <i>Unc13a</i><sup>KO</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> cells expressing only EGFP were used as control. For the purpose of comparison, the averaged traces obtained from the rescue experiments with the four isoforms were plotted in the same graph (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The exocytotic burst was measured as the \u25b3Cm within the first 0.5\u2009s after the flash stimulus, and the rate of sustained release was measured as the \u25b3Cm between 0.5\u2009s and 4\u2009s after the flash (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Interestingly, Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 were both able to rescue the LDCV release deficit of <i>Unc13a</i><sup>KO</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). However, rescue with ubMunc13-2 resulted in an enormous enhancement of LDCV exocytosis to levels that by far exceeded the amount of exocytosis typical of WT cells, for both the exocytotic burst and the rate of sustained release (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). The direct comparison of Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 expressing cells with matching EGFP fluorescence intensity confirmed that the stronger enhancement of burst size and rate of sustained release in ubMunc13-2 expressing cells was not due to higher expression levels of ubMunc13-2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

SV docking deficits of Munc13/Unc-13 deficient\u00a0synapses in mice and <i>C. elegans</i> were previously only detected when rapid cryo-fixation methods were employed instead of classical chemical fixation for ultrastructural analysis (<a href=\"#bib61\">Siksou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Weimer et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, it has been shown that 3D electron tomography (ET) allows a more accurate assessment of SV docking at the active zone (<a href=\"#bib27\">Imig et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Siksou et al., 2009</a>). To study LDCV recruitment and docking in chromaffin cells, we therefore combined high-pressure freezing (HPF) and freeze-substitution of acute adrenal gland slices with classical 2D-EM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013E</a>) and high-resolution 3D-ET analyses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013N</a>). Quantitative analysis of 2D-EM images of <i>Unc13a</i><sup>Het</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>Het</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and <i>Unc13a</i><sup>KO</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> chromaffin cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) did not reveal any differences in LDCV distribution within 2 \u03bcm of the plasma membrane (PM) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), in the number of membrane-proximal LDCVs within 40 nm of the PM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), or in the total number of LDCVs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). LDCV docking and recruitment into the vicinity of the PM were assessed using 3D-ET (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013N</a>). From all LDCVs analyzed within 100 nm of the PM, the percentage of membrane-proximal LDCVs (0\u201340 nm) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M</a>) and their distribution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>) was unaltered between both groups, indicating that LDCV recruitment to the PM is intact in Munc13-deficient chromaffin cells. The number of docked LDCVs, defined as LDCVs in physical contact with the PM and assigned to the 0\u20134 nm bin in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>, and the number of docked LDCVs normalized to the number of membrane-proximal LDCVs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6N</a>) were unchanged. Furthermore, the average LDCV diameter of docked or non-docked LDCVs, measured by 3D-ET, did not differ significantly between genotypes, although <i>Unc13a</i><sup>KO</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> LDCVs tended to be smaller (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, in spite of the dramatic release deficit seen in <i>Unc13a</i><sup>KO</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> chromaffin cells and the dramatic SV docking deficit seen in neurons of this genotype (<a href=\"#bib61\">Siksou et al., 2009</a>), we did not detect any changes in LDCV docking, nor a loss or accumulation of LDCVs in the vicinity of the PM. Thus, chromaffin cells can generate what appears to be a full-sized pool of morphologically docked LDCVs in the absence of Munc13-1 and Munc13-2, which implies that the molecular requirements of morphological LDCV and SV docking are distinct. Additionally, this could either indicate that the mechanism of functional docking, that\u00a0is, priming, differs between LDCV and SVs as well, or else, that the primed LDCVs (i.e., those that belong to the RRP) are in the minority among the docked vesicles and therefore cannot be detected."

To this end, we re-calculated the percentage of docked vesicles identified using 3D-ET, as the percentage of membrane proximal vesicles (0\u201340 nm) identified in the 2D-EM analysis and converted LDCVs/\u03bcm PM to LDCVs/cell as described (<a href=\"#bib50\">Parsons et al., 1995</a>). This conversion was necessary due to the limited volume sizes analyzed by 3D-ET and the uneven distribution of LDCVs within the cells. The estimated size of the morphologically docked pool was \u223c662 LDCVs per chromaffin cell in control cells. For <i>Unc13a</i><sup>KO</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> cells we calculated \u223c865 docked LDCVs per cell, which can be accounted for by two factors used in the calculation: <i>Unc13a</i><sup>KO</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> cells are slightly larger, and their LDCVs are slightly smaller (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Both values are lower than the previously reported \u223c1607 for embryonic day (E)18 murine chromaffin cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">de Wit, 2010</a>), presumably reflecting improved discrimination between docked and undocked vesicles by 3D-ET. With a diameter of a docked LDCV of \u223c170 nm (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) and assuming a specific membrane capacitance of 1 \u03bcF/cm<sup>2</sup>, this corresponds to a vesicular capacitance of 0.91 fF, in excellent agreement with recent electrophysiological measurements of 0.94 fF (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pinheiro et al., 2014</a>). Thereby, the size of the RRP, which is &lt;40 fF at resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<a href=\"#bib75\">Voets, 2000</a>), corresponds to &lt;44 vesicles from the total of \u223c662 in control cells, indicating that even with 3D-ET, the RRP will be very hard or even impossible to distinguish morphologically from other docked vesicles in adrenal chromaffin cells."

                                "text": "Thus far, our data indicate that although morphological docking of LDCVs does not require Munc13s, the priming of a functional RRP does. We therefore wanted to identify the Munc13-sensitive step in the LDCV priming process, and compare the intrinsic properties of Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2, the two most relevant isoforms in the adrenal medulla. In a recently published mathematical model for LDCV fusion, we showed that the fast and slow bursts of release originate from two serially arranged pools of vesicles, the RRP and the non-releasable NRP, respectively (<a href=\"#bib78\">Walter et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The NRP in turn is refilled from a larger depot pool. Thus, the model features two separate priming steps (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010</a>), but only one fusion pathway (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Since the deletion of <i>Unc13a</i> and <i>Unc13b</i> changed the fast and slow burst to nearly the same degree (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), within the framework of this model, Munc13s must act upstream of the NRP. Furthermore, since the sustained release rate is changed proportionally as well, Munc13s likely act to accelerate the forward priming rate, k<sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashery et al., 2000</a>). In most models, this rate constant k<sub>1</sub> is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (<a href=\"#bib75\">Voets, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Walter et al., 2013</a>), and confers overall Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence to the primed vesicle pool. We next investigated how the two relevant Munc13-isoforms in chromaffin cells (ubMunc13-2, Munc13-1) affect this priming step."

The release fraction at 30 ms (traces normalized to their amplitude after 3 s) after the stimulus was determined as the read-out for priming (vertical broken lines). Right panel: the fraction of release plotted as a function of pre-flash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].

(<b>B</b>) Fits of a secretion model (see panel <b>E</b>) to the capacitance responses observed experimentally in <i>Unc13a</i><sup>KO</sup><i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> cells expressing Munc13-1 at intermediate and low pre-flash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Top panel: measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> values were used to drive the secretion model. The chemical equation shows a priming sensor (PS), which is active in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound state (Ca<sub>n</sub>PS).

The best-fit values suggest a \u223c2.5-fold slower on-rate (activation rate), but a 4.5-fold higher maximal priming rate for ubMunc13-2 (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), resulting in a sigmoidal secretion response from low pre-flash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. (<b>D</b>) Fitting our secretion model to the experimental data of several genotypes suggests that Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 both primarily act by increasing the forward priming rate (k<sub>1</sub>, see also panel <b>E</b>), while loss of ubMunc13-2 \u2013 the dominant endogenous isoform \u2013 has the opposite effect.

(<b>E</b>) Secretion model: Munc13-1 (green) and ubMunc13-2 (blue) regulate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding rates (k<sub>on</sub>) to a PS, which controls the asymptotic forward priming rate k<sub>1</sub> (see text for details, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for fitted parameters, and <a href=\"#bib78\">Walter et al., 2013</a> for model development).

However, when applying Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uncaging flashes from a relatively low pre-flash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the two isoforms induce quite different secretion kinetics (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). For ubMunc13-2, secretion shows a clear sigmoid shape with acceleration after \u223c0.5\u2009s (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), which is absent when the pre-flash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is higher. This sigmoid shape of ubMunc13-2 driven secretion was noted before and was attributed to a slow association of ubMunc13-2 with Calmodulin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in a slow 'priming switch' (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zikich et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, Munc13-1 does not show this secondary acceleration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), regardless of the pre-flash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. To understand the origin of this behavior, we modeled the Ca<sup>2+</sup> association with the priming sensor (PS) explicitly \u2013 in our previous model (<a href=\"#bib78\">Walter et al., 2013</a>), this step had been assumed to be always in equilibrium. In accordance with the observed identical steady state Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependencies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), we used identical dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) values for both isoforms, and varied only the on-rate, k<sub>on</sub>, (the off-rate was changed simultaneously, k<sub>off</sub> = K<sub>D</sub>*k<sub>on</sub>, with constant K<sub>D</sub>). This led to a very satisfactory fit to both Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 data from both low and high pre-flash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Also, this model made it possible to fit both the control trace, and the <i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> trace (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Importantly, the fit was performed simultaneously to all traces, so that we could ensure consistency between fits, simplify the interpretation of parameter changes, and ensure that all conditions could be reproduced by one version of our model (for fitted parameters, refer to <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

We note that our conclusion that Munc13-1/ubMunc13-2 exert their main effects upstream of both pools (NRP/SRP and RRP), i.e. on k<sub>1</sub>, is consistent with both ideas (see also <a href=\"#bib2\">Ashery et al., 2000</a>). Therefore, our observations here do not necessarily distinguish between the parallel pool model (SRP and RRP are both releasable) and the sequential pool model (only the RRP is releasable); but see (<a href=\"#bib78\">Walter et al., 2013</a>) for data supporting the sequential pool model."

This is seen both by the increase in the fitted k<sub>1</sub> upon overexpression of either isoform, and by the decrease of k<sub>1</sub> in the <i>Unc13b</i><sup>KO</sup> cells. Second, ubMunc13-2 increases k<sub>1</sub> 4.5-fold more than Munc13-1, but it does so after a longer delay. In the model, this delay is due to slower kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the priming sensor (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zikich et al., 2008</a>). Note that this step might coincide with the translocation of Munc13-1 or ubMunc13-2 to the membrane as a prerequisite for the priming action of the protein. Thus, the different delays might reflect differences in the membrane translocation step. As a minor note, we also noticed that k<sub>2</sub>, the forward rate of downstream priming ('priming 2', <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) always changed in the opposite direction of k<sub>1</sub>. The reason for this is unclear, but one explanation could be that the protein(s) driving downstream priming compete with Munc13 for association with the fusion machinery."

However, as will be discussed below, morphological docking of LDCVs does not require Munc13s (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), yet the priming of a full-sized RRP does (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), indicating that LDCV docking and functional priming do not represent a one-step process in neuroendocrine cells."

Thus, in contrast to synapses, where most, if not all docked SVs are part of the RRP, the majority of docked LDCVs in chromaffin cells are not primed, and the functional RRP therefore cannot be distinguished from other docked LDCVs by current ultrastructural methods.

SV docking requires the SNARE proteins Stx-1, SNAP-25, and Syb-2, as well as Munc13s and CAPSs, but not necessarily the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor of fusion, Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Imig et al., 2014</a>). By contrast, current models imply that LDCV docking is mediated by Syt-1, possibly via interaction with the Stx-1/SNAP-25 acceptor complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Wit et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">de Wit et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Parisotto et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, Munc18-1 docks LDCVs via its interaction with the closed form of Stx-1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gandasi and Barg, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gerber et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gulyas-Kovacs et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Han et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Voets et al., 2001</a>) and is also involved in an additional tethering step (<a href=\"#bib68\">Toonen et al., 2006</a>). The vesicular SNAREs seem to be dispensable for docking in chromaffin cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borisovska et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gerber et al., 2008</a>), although they have been implicated in PC12 cells (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). Some of these discrepancies are most likely due to methodological and terminological differences as well as to limitations in assessing true membrane attachment. However, since we used the same experimental approach previously employed to detect SV docking deficits (<a href=\"#bib27\">Imig et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Siksou et al., 2009</a>), our data clearly show that the molecular requirements of SV and LDCV docking are distinct. More specifically, while the formation of the docked/primed RRP requires Munc13s in both cases, and thus appears to be mechanistically quite similar for SVs and LDCVs, the non-primed LDCVs in chromaffin cells appear to dock via a separate, Munc13-independent mechanism."

What this second configuration would look like in terms of molecular interactions is less clear. Docking via Syt-1/Stx-1/SNAP-25 complexes would be consistent with un-primed docking (<a href=\"#bib13\">de Wit et al., 2009</a>). This mode of docking would require the assumption that in chromaffin cells, Stx-1/SNAP-25 complexes can escape NSF/SNAP mediated disassembly.

This essentially allows us to describe what was previously interpreted as the release of two kinetically distinct LDCV pools (SRP and RRP), as two sequential priming processes, priming 1 and priming 2, resulting in only one releasable pool, the RRP (<a href=\"#bib78\">Walter et al., 2013</a>). According to previous data, the step most sensitive to Munc13s \u2013 priming 1 \u2013 is also the step affected by mutations designed to interfere with the initiation of N-terminal SNARE complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib78\">Walter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Walter et al., 2010</a>).

Our model therefore provides a theoretical framework for how the molecular properties of priming factors may be linked to the kinetics of exocytosis."

Remarkably, overexpression and deletion of Munc13s change the rate constants k<sub>1</sub> (priming 1) and k<sub>2</sub> (priming 2) in opposite directions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). One possible reason for this effect could be that the interaction of Munc13s with the SNARE fusion machinery may compete with that of another priming protein, which mainly catalyzes priming step 2. A likely candidate for this second catalyst appears to be CAPS, as deletion of CAPS1 and CAPS2 leads to a significant reduction of the RRP, but has little effect on the NRP/SRP, placing Munc13 upstream of CAPS (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2008</a>)."

We therefore propose an LDCV priming model, in which the Munc13-driven priming step 1 corresponds to the initiation of N-terminal SNARE-complex assembly, and the CAPS-driven priming step 2 represents a more C-terminal, and presumably more easily completed phase of zippering (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). Assuming that priming step 2 is not catalyzed by CAPS alone but also influenced by Munc13 and possibly Syt-1, such a model would also offer an explanation as to why in both SV and LDCV exocytosis, lack of CAPS can be compensated for by an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas lack of Munc13 cannot (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jockusch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kabachinski et al., 2014</a>)."

In LDCV priming, the step most sensitive to Munc13s is the initial phase (priming step 1), which most likely corresponds to the initiation of N-terminal SNARE-complex assembly. Individual Munc13 isoforms accelerate this step at distinct rates, thereby imparting distinct properties on the kinetics of LDCV release, which indicates that they may have specialized functions in the fine-tuning of catecholamine release in response to varying physiological stimuli."

Slices were allowed to recover in bicarbonate-buffered saline (125 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose and 0.2 mM (+)-tubocurarine) at 37\u00b0C for 15\u2009min and were subsequently kept in the same solution at RT before cryofixation. Slices were rapidly frozen in external cryoprotectant (20% BSA in bicarbonate-buffered saline) using a HPM100 HPF device (Leica). After freezing, samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until further processing. Freeze substitution was performed as previously published (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rostaing et al., 2006</a>). Briefly, samples were substituted in anhydrous acetone, fixed by 2% OsO<sub>4</sub> in acetone for 7\u00a0h at -90\u00b0C prior to a temperature ramp (5\u00b0C/h) to -20\u00b0C, an incubation for 16\u2009hr at -20\u00b0C, and a final ramp (10\u00b0C/h) to 4\u00b0C. Samples were washed in acetone and infiltrated with EPON resin at room temperature (acetone/EPON 1:1 for 3\u2009h, 90% EPON in acetone overnight, and pure EPON for 36\u2009h). Finally specimen carriers containing infiltrated samples were incubated for 24\u2009hr at 60\u00b0C to polymerize. Aluminum sample carriers were trimmed off the EPON block with a specimen trimming device (EM TRIM2, Leica) to expose the surface of the embedded tissue for ultramicrotomy."

Assembled montages had dimensions of approximately 21 \u00d7 21 \u00b5m and typically contained 1\u20133 randomly chosen chromaffin cells. Only chromaffin cells with a clearly visible plasma membrane were included in the analysis. iTEM software was used to measure chromaffin cell plasma membrane circumference and the cytoplasmic area (calculated by subtraction of the nuclear area from the total cell area). Additional parameters including the number of LDCVs and the shortest distance of each LDCV to the plasma membrane were quantified using ImageJ software. In regions where the plasma membrane did not appear as a clear cut, the shortest distance from the vesicle membrane to the middle of the membrane projection was measured. For this reason and due to the fact that LDCVs (mean diameter of CTRL LDCVs ~160 nm; ~170 nm for docked CTRL LDCVs) might have their centers outside of the imaged ultrathin (50 nm) section, we did not quantify LDCV docking as defined by physical membrane-attachment in these 2D projection images, but rather calculated the number of membrane-proximal LDCVs (within 0\u201340 nm of the plasma membrane). All vesicles with electron-dense cargo were included in the analysis. Secretory vesicles of both genotypes exhibited heterogeneity in size (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and appearance (e.g. compactness of the dense-core), possibly reflecting distinct LDCV types (e.g. adrenaline vs. noradrenaline) or different levels of maturity present in immature (E18) chromaffin cells. Data are presented as LDCV density (number of LDCVs per \u00b5m\u00b2 area cytoplasm), the number of LDCVs within 40 nm of the plasma membrane normalized to the cell perimeter, and the mean frequency distribution of LDCVs from the plasma membrane in 40 nm bins."

Single-axis tilt series were acquired from -60\u00b0 to +60\u00b0 with 1\u00b0 increments and binned by the factor two at 10,000-fold magnification using an Orius SC1000 camera (Gatan) and the SerialEM software for automated tilt series acquisition (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mastronarde, 2005</a>). Tomograms were reconstructed using the IMOD package (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kremer et al., 1996</a>), and exported as z-stacks for analysis with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). All analyses were performed blindly and manually. The smallest distance between the plasma membrane and the outer leaflet of each LDCV membrane was measured at its vesicular midline using the straight-line tool of ImageJ on individual virtual z-slices. Only vesicles observed in physical contact with the plasma membrane in tomographic volumes were considered \u2018docked\u2019. In distribution analyses docked LDCVs were assigned to the 0\u20134 nm bin to account for the voxel dimensions of reconstructed tomograms (isotropic voxel size = 2.86 nm). The number of membrane-attached (0\u20134 nm, \u2018docked\u2019) LDCVs identified in a tomographically reconstructed volume was normalized to the number of membrane-proximal (0\u201340 nm of plasma membrane) LDCVs. The number of membrane-proximal (0\u201340 nm) LDCVs was expressed as a percentage of all LDCVs within 100 nm of the plasma membrane and compared across genotypes to test for potential differences in the ability of recruiting LDCVs close to the plasma membrane. The frequency distribution displays the number of docked LDCVs (0\u20134 nm, first bin) and subsequently the distances of LDCVs from the plasma membrane in 2 nm bins. Statistical analyses were performed using Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test. The mean LDCV diameter was calculated from the area of the LDCV measured at its midline including the vesicular phospholipid bilayer in electron tomograms by using the elliptical selection tool in ImageJ. All LDCVs in the randomly chosen field of view that contained their midline within the tomographic volume were analyzed (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To account for the fact that more data points exist for slower components (due to the constant sampling rate) which would dominate the fit, deviations at shorter times after the uncaging flash were given larger weight: the weight was 100 for all datapoints upto 80 ms after the uncaging stimulus; the weight was 10 for all datapoints occurring later than 80 ms, but earlier than 1.2\u2009s after the stimulus; the weight was 1 for all datapoints thereafter. To ensure consistency, all conditions depicted in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> were fitted simultaneously and the cost values from all data were summed. Only the parameters labeled with \u201cbest fit\u201d in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> were allowed to vary. Because the lowest bin of the capacitance traces of the DKO overexpressing Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B and C</a> contained relatively few cells, the total number of vesicles was also a free parameter under these conditions (best fit values V<sub>tot</sub>(Munc13-1 low Ca<sup>2+</sup>)\u00a0=\u00a02120 fF, V<sub>tot</sub>(Munc13-1 low Ca<sup>2+</sup>)\u00a0=\u00a03340 fF). All parameters were optimized by minimizing the cost values using a Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm implemented in the Matlab function 'fminsearch' (version R2013a, Mathworks)."

This is a thorough study (using capacitance, amperometry, and EM on chromaffin cells from various mouse Munc13 KO lines) of the role of Munc13 in large dense core vesicle (LDCV) exocytosis in chromaffin cells. Previous studies had shown that Munc13s and CAPSs, proteins that like Munc13 contain a MUN domain, play important functions in synaptic vesicle exocytosis in mammals, and CAPSs had also been shown to mediate LDCV in chromaffin cells. However, studies in invertebrates showed that synaptic vesicle exocytosis requires the Munc13 homologue Unc13 while LDCV exocytosis requires the CAPS homologue unc31. The key question that arises is whether Munc13s are involved in LDCV exocytosis in chromaffin cells. The authors show that Munc13-2 plays a key role in priming, but not docking of LDCVs. This is at variance of the role of Munc13 in synaptic vesicle exocytosis where it also appears to also play a role in docking. The most striking result is that LDCV docking in chromaffin cells does not require Munc13 in marked contrast to synaptic vesicles (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> of Imig et al., Neuron, 2014)."

An additional complication is that various protocols involve a calcium-dependent activation step so that an RRP in resting cells is not really being measured. The location of Munc13s relative to sites of exocytosis is not indicated. Moreover, there are some concerns about the discussion and interpretation of the results."

However, while Munc18 interactions with membranes have been reported (e.g., Xu et al., PLOS One 6, e22012, 2011) such interactions appear to be rather non-specific. Another possibility is binding of Munc18 to Rab3, i.e., docking vial Rab3/Munc18-1/Stx-1. It is less likely that Syt1 were to facilitate docking via interaction with the syntaxin-SNAP-25 (binary) complex, since it would be inconsistent with the results by Ma et al., 2013 that suggests that NSF/SNAP disassembles the binary complex, allowing Munc18 to strongly bind to syntaxin and inducing the closed conformation of syntaxin. While these other models and experimental results do not necessarily rule out the models proposed by the authors, there appears to be some uncertainty in interpreting the observed results in terms of molecular interactions. A more complete discussion would be desirable, and perhaps offering some other explanations as well (e.g., the existence of a new tethering factor or tethering/docking mechanism for LDCV vesicles)."

They then reach the conclusion that Munc13 alters k<sub>1</sub> in \"priming 1\" step. However, it seems that the experimental fitting started with this assumption. Paradoxically k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> in the model changed in opposite directions, an outcome that is difficult to understand. It seems that other models would also fit the data but these are not discussed. Priming 1 and priming 2 might correspond to parallel pathways of priming and fusion. Several studies suggest two classes of chromaffin granules based on size or synaptotagmin composition. Another very possible model would be that k<sub>1</sub> corresponds to the translocation of Munc13 to the membrane and is enhanced by calcium-dependent pre-priming. Thus, it is difficult to be convinced that the formation of the NRP is a precursor to the RRP as part of a two-step priming mechanism or that Munc13 affects k<sub>1</sub> but not k<sub>2</sub>. Alternative hypotheses for the NRP and RRP need discussion."

Thus, we would need a separate set of almost identical parameters for each pool.

We (or better, some of us) have published data to support the idea that the slow pool fuses via the fast pool (Walter et al., 2013). We sense that the reviewers likely disagree, however for the present paper this issue does not matter much because we conclude that ubMunc13-2 and Munc13-1 exert their main effect (on k<sub>1</sub>) upstream of both pools.

This finding was the basis for the sequential arrangement of SRP and RRP in 1999. This was further substantiated by the fact that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming is similar for SRP and RRP, and therefore it is reasonable to assume a common upstream step feeding both pools (Voets, 2000). If it can be shown that the two types of vesicles are molecularly different \u2013 and if molecular differences between vesicles can be related directly to those two phases in capacitance traces, and if some other explanation for the effects in the Voets papers can be found \u2013 this would have to be changed.

We put forward a reasonable explanation: \u201cthat the interaction of Munc13s with the SNARE fusion machinery may compete with that of another priming protein, which mainly catalyzes priming step 2.\u201d Thus, it seems to be a general feature of most proteins involved in exocytosis that they exert both positive and negative effects.

Thus, as is common practice in the field, we made an informed guess about the correct model (and in the process, we have explored other options, but going through all of them would make the paper impossible to read). The elegance (we feel) of the model is that only a very small set of different parameters are necessary to describe the functional difference between ubMunc13-2 and Munc13-1. Please note that the major effect on priming is covered by only two different parameters between ubMunc13-2 and Munc13-1 (the energy barrier for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, and the different effects on k<sub>1</sub>), and that both ubMunc13-2 and Munc13-1 perform similar functions on the fusion machinery (increasing k<sub>1</sub>, most likely by stimulating SNARE-complex assembly). This is nicely consistent with the expectation that two so similar proteins should have similar effects. Yet, the model comes up with a useful prediction about why the kinetic outcomes can be different. This prediction can be tested.
