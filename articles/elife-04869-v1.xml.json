Quiescence is also crucial for maintaining tissues in a healthy condition in adults.

Importantly, once Prospero levels returned to normal background levels, the resulting quiescent neuroblasts started proliferating again, confirming that neuroblasts exposed to a short pulse of Prospero do indeed become quiescent."

The analysis of individuals who had one non-functional copy of the <i>Prox1</i> gene suggests that some of these functions may depend on how much Prox1 is present (<a href=\"#bib3\">Dyer, 2003</a>). Prox1 has been linked to a variety of cancer types in humans in the last few years (<a href=\"#bib4\">Elsir et al., 2012</a>)."

This is abundantly exploited in different contexts during development and, perhaps, might also be relevant for disease."
