ATF6\u03b1 target genes encode foldases, chaperones, and lipid biosynthesis enzymes that increase protein-folding capacity in response to demand. The off-state of ATF6\u03b1 is maintained by its spatial separation in the ER from Golgi-resident proteases that activate it. ER stress induces trafficking of ATF6\u03b1. We discovered Ceapins, a class of pyrazole amides, as selective inhibitors of ATF6\u03b1 signaling that do not inhibit the Golgi proteases or other UPR branches. We show that Ceapins block ATF6\u03b1 signaling by trapping it in ER-resident foci that are excluded from ER exit sites. Removing the requirement for trafficking by pharmacological elimination of the spatial separation of the ER and Golgi apparatus restored cleavage of ATF6\u03b1 in the presence of Ceapins. Washout of Ceapins resensitized ATF6\u03b1 to ER stress. These results suggest that trafficking of ATF6\u03b1 is regulated by its oligomeric state."

Many proteins are folded in a cell compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. The cell closely monitors the quality of the work done by this compartment. If the endoplasmic reticulum has more proteins to fold than it can handle, unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate and trigger a stress response called the unfolded protein response. This increases the capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum to fold proteins to match the demand. However, if the stress persists, then the unfolded protein response instructs the cell to die to protect the rest of the body."

When the enzymes that cut ATF6\u03b1 are sent to the endoplasmic reticulum, Ceapin treatment no longer prevents ATF6\u03b1 activation, which shows that these small molecules specifically inhibit the stress-induced movement of ATF6\u03b1. When Ceapins are washed out of cells, the ATF6\u03b1 clusters fall apart and ATF6\u03b1 can now move to the Golgi."

However, when cells experience stress, the ATF6\u03b1 clusters fall apart to allow the protein to move to the Golgi. The next steps following on from this work are to find out what these clusters are, how they are influenced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and exactly how the Ceapins stabilize these clusters."

ATF6\u03b1 target genes are exclusively cytoprotective, functioning to increase the folding capacity of the ER and restore ER homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adachi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Wu et al., 2007</a>). Cells or animals lacking ATF6\u03b1 show impaired survival upon ER stress (<a href=\"#bib4\">Wu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Yamamoto et al., 2007</a>). When demand exceeds the folding capacity of the ER, ATF6\u03b1 is transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where sequential cleavage by two Golgi-resident proteases \u2013 site-1 and site-2 proteases (S1P and S2P), respectively - releases its N-terminal domain (ATF6\u03b1-N) from the membrane as a functional b-Zip transcription factor. ATF6\u03b1-N is then imported into the nucleus (nuclear translocation) where it activates transcription of its target genes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ye et al., 2000</a>). The mechanism that retains ATF6\u03b1 in the ER and then releases it to allow transport to the Golgi apparatus is unknown. Deciphering the mechanism of ATF6\u03b1\u2019s regulated trafficking is essential to understanding how proteostasis is maintained in the ER."

The lumenal domain of ATF6\u03b1 (ATF6\u03b1-LD) dictates whether ATF6\u03b1 localizes to the ER or to the Golgi apparatus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</a>). In fact, the soluble ATF6\u03b1-LD alone is sufficient to sense ER stress (<a href=\"#bib10\">Sato et al., 2011</a>), and attaching the ATF6\u03b1-LD to the constitutively transported SNARE protein Sec22 is sufficient to retain Sec22 in the ER of unstressed cells, allowing its trafficking to the Golgi apparatus only upon ER stress (<a href=\"#bib9\">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</a>). Thus ATF6\u03b1-LD is ATF6\u03b1\u2018s stress-sensor and regulates its trafficking. It is unclear what aspect of the folding environment ATF6\u03b1-LD is sensing, or if ATF6\u03b1 senses misfolded proteins directly."

Activation of ATF6\u03b1 therefore requires transmitting the signal from the ER lumen to the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib9\">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Nadanaka et al., 2004</a>). It is unknown whether ATF6\u03b1 interacts with the COPII coat directly or requires a transmembrane adaptor or traffics by bulk-flow after release from a transport-incompetent state. SREBP, the membrane bound transcription factor that responds to low cholesterol, has an elegant trafficking mechanism involving binding of a retention factor, INSIG, to a transport factor, SCAP (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</a>). Indeed it is SCAP, not SREBP, that binds to and senses cholesterol and this binding regulates the interaction of SCAP both with its retention factor INSIG and with the COPII coat (<a href=\"#bib14\">Sun et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Motamed et al., 2011</a>). SREBP itself neither senses the signal nor interacts with the trafficking machinery. Similarly, a putative ACAP (ATF6\u03b1 cleavage activating protein) and/or a putative INSIG-like ATF6\u03b1 retention factor may remain to be discovered."

Using Ceapins to interrogate each step of ATF6\u03b1 activation, we show here that Ceapins prevent selection of ATF6\u03b1 into COPII vesicles by retaining it in foci in the ER membrane. Removing the requirement for trafficking by bringing together substrate and proteases restored cleavage in the presence of Ceapins. Ceapins induce rapid clustering of ATF6\u03b1, indicating that its oligomeric state plays a key role to regulate its trafficking and thereby activation in response to ER stress. Based on its mode of action corralling ATF6\u03b1 into ER-restricted foci, we named Ceapins after the Irish verb 'ceap,' meaning 'to trap' ."

To this end, we used a U2-OS cell line, which stably expresses a fluorescent GFP-ATF6\u03b1 fusion protein at low levels. We followed nuclear translocation of GFP-ATF6\u03b1-N, the proteolytic fragment resulting from GFP- ATF6\u03b1 cleavage in response to ER stress. In unstressed cells, GFP-ATF6\u03b1 localized to the ER (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and E</a>, <i>green</i>). As expected, after induction of ER stress by treatment with thapsigargin (Tg), which inhibits the ER calcium pump, or tunicamycin (Tm), which inhibits N-linked glycosylation, we observed a fraction of the GFP fluorescence in the nucleus, apparent by co-localization with DAPI-stained nuclear DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and F</a>, DNA in <i>purple</i>, co-localization indicated by <i>white color</i> in overlay). Induction of ER stress in the presence of active Ceapin-A7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and G</a>) but not of the inactive Ceapin analog A5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and H</a>) prevented nuclear translocation of GFP-ATF6\u03b1-N and led to an accumulation of GFP fluorescence in discrete foci (quantified in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We have previously shown [accompanying manuscript; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gallagher et al., 2016</a>] that under these conditions active Ceapin analogs block ATF6\u03b1 proteolysis, indicating that the foci correspond to a pool of uncleaved GFP-ATF6\u03b1."

Treatment with vehicle alone showed ER localization that did not change over time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). In contrast, after induction of ER stress GFP fluorescence first accumulated in a perinuclear region, consistent with movement of GFP-ATF6\u03b1 to the Golgi apparatus, and then accumulated in the nucleus, consistent with proteolytic processing and nuclear import of the resulting GFP-ATF6\u03b1-N (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). Addition of either active Ceapin-A7 or Ceapin-A1 induced rapid foci formation of GFP-ATF6\u03b1, while inhibiting nuclear accumulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K and L</a>). In contrast, the inactive Ceapin analog A5 failed to induce foci formation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Importantly, we observed that active but not inactive Ceapin analogs induce GFP-ATF6\u03b1 foci even in the absence of ER stress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M and N</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and these foci persist for up to twenty-four hours (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results suggest that Ceapins inhibit ATF6\u03b1 signaling by capturing it in foci. Interestingly we also see foci in cells subjected to ER stress alone at later time points corresponding to the time point at which attenuation of ATF6\u03b1 signaling would initiate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, 90 min time point and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haze et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Rutkowski et al., 2006</a>)."

Cells treated with active Ceapin analogs (Ceapin-A1 and Ceapin-A7; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>) showed rapid formation of GFP-ATF6\u03b1 foci. We allowed foci to form for 17 min, then washed the cells, and added media without inhibitors. Washout of both Ceapin analogs led to rapid dissolution of GFP-ATF6\u03b1 foci, indicating the foci formation was reversible (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). Cells treated with vehicle alone showed no change in GFP-ATF6\u03b1 localization throughout the washout experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We observed the same washout kinetics in cells pretreated for three hours with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis, a time point at which it is reasonable to expect any newly translated GFP-ATF6\u03b1 had folded and matured (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heim et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cormack et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Sacchetti, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Sacchetti et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">P\u00e9delacq et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ugrinov and Clark, 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">Videos 10</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media13\">13</a>).

Treatment of these cells with Ceapin-A1, either in the presence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>) or absence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) of ER stress, led to formation of 3xFLAG-ATF6\u03b1 foci that decorated ER tubules (arrowheads in zoomed views).

No such co-localization was observed upon co-treatment with Ceapin-A1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). Thus the Ceapin-induced formation of ATF6\u03b1 foci is independent of the nature of the tag and likely reflects an intrinsic property of ATF6\u03b1."

To our surprise, we found that, even in unstressed cells, endogenous ATF6\u03b1 was not evenly distributed but found in small foci that were finely distributed over the ER network (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). These observations contrasted with those described above made in cells over-expressing tagged versions of ATF6\u03b1 that were diffusely ER-localized. After two hours of ER stress, a portion of endogenous ATF6\u03b1 co-localized with the Golgi marker GM130 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u201d</a>, arrowheads in inserts), and we observed a significant portion of ATF6\u03b1 staining in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and B\u2019</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, bar 2, p&lt;0.0001). Ceapin-A7 reduced co-localization of ATF6\u03b1 with GM130 (GM130, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u201d</a>, arrowheads in inserts) and blocked nuclear accumulation of ATF6\u03b1, retaining it in ER foci (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2019</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, bar 3, p&lt;0.0001). After two hours of treatment with Ceapin-A7 in the absence or presence of ER stress, ATF6\u03b1 foci appeared larger and brighter than in unstressed cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). The data show that endogenous ATF6\u03b1 largely phenocopies the behavior of its tagged-variants characterized above and reveal that at physiological expression levels and in the absence of ER stress ATF6\u03b1 is already clustered in small foci in the ER membrane. Ceapins may further stabilize these foci, trapping ATF6\u03b1 in the ER and thus preventing its Golgi apparatus trafficking and nuclear translocation."

In unstressed cells, ATF6\u03b1 is in foci in the ER. Upon ER stress, ATF6a moves from the ER to the Golgi, where it is proteolyzed to release ATF6\u03b1-N that translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of ATF6\u03b1 target genes. After prolonged ER stress ATF6\u03b1 signaling attenuates and ATF6\u03b1 foci are seen in the ER.

Here we show that one of the earliest steps in ATF6\u03b1 activation \u2013 its selection as cargo to leave the ER \u2013 can be inhibited using Ceapins, a newly identified chemical scaffold. In cells treated with Ceapins, ATF6\u03b1 clusters in foci that do not leave the ER, because it no longer engages with ER exit sites upon ER stress. Consequently, ATF6\u03b1 is trapped in its uncleaved, inactive state. Importantly, Ceapins no longer inhibit proteolysis and activation of ATF6\u03b1 upon lifting the requirement for ATF6\u03b1 trafficking from the ER for proteolytic processing by relocalizing the Golgi-resident S1P and S2P proteases back to the ER. This is in contrast to the S1P inhibitor, which as expected, inhibits S1P independently of its subcellular localization. Thus Ceapins do not drive ATF6\u03b1 into an uncleavable form that would occlude the interaction with S1P."

This is the first evidence that there is a difference in the activation mechanisms employed by these two highly similar proteins. To date, ATF6\u03b1 and ATF6\u03b2 were thought to be equivalent in their mechanism of stress-sensing and trafficking. These data become even more surprising, because the lumenal domains of ATF6\u03b1 and ATF6\u03b2 are highly conserved and regulate ER stress-sensing and ER exit. Similarly, Ceapins do not interfere with SREBP signaling in response to cholesterol depletion, further underscoring that neither stress-sensing, cargo selection, nor ER-Golgi transport are generally affected by the drug. Ceapins could act on either side of the membrane to inhibit ATF6\u03b1 trafficking. Its high level of selectivity strongly suggests that Ceapins act by binding to ATF6\u03b1 or to an ATF6\u03b1\u2013dedicated accessory factor that remains to be identified."

Our data showing that Ceapins trap ATF6\u03b1 in the ER membrane in foci distinct from ER exit sites suggest a simple model of its action (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>): Ceapins bind to ATF6\u03b1 or some unknown accessory factor, stabilizing an oligomeric state that is not transport competent. In an oligomer, the interface required for interaction with the COPII coat could be buried, while in its monomeric form ATF6\u03b1 would be recognized as cargo. This model is attractive because of the speed with which ATF6\u03b1 foci form and dissolve after addition or removal of Ceapins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). It is further supported by data showing that all active Ceapin analogs tested induced foci formation of ATF6\u03b1. In contrast, inactive Ceapin analogs either did not induce ATF6\u03b1 foci or induced unstable foci that quickly disassembled during drug treatment. Moreover, dissolution of foci after washout of Ceapin analogs restored ER stress-induced transport to the Golgi apparatus."

We found that unlike over-expressed ATF6\u03b1 fusion proteins, endogenous ATF6\u03b1 in unstressed cells is found in foci, suggesting that the resting, ER-retained state of ATF6\u03b1 is an oligomer or higher order complex. In addition, ATF6\u03b1 signaling attenuates in the face of unmitigated ER stress: although ATF6\u03b1 is still plentiful in the ER, its proteolytic cleavage to produce ATF6\u03b1-N is only observed at early time points after induction of ER stress (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haze et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Rutkowski et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with this, we observed formation of ATF6\u03b1 foci in cells treated with ER stress alone at time points at which attenuation of ATF6\u03b1 signaling occurs. Our model poses that activation of ATF6\u03b1 is achieved by shifting the equilibrium from a higher-order complex to a smaller entity (most likely an ATF6\u03b1 monomer [<a href=\"#bib33\">Nadanaka et al., 2007</a>]) that can be productively recruited into transport vesicles and that attenuation is achieved by shifting the equilibrium back. Ceapins prevent the formation of the transport-competent form even in the presence of ER stress. In this view, Ceapins engage the mechanisms that control normal retention/attenuation of ATF6\u03b1."

Both stress-induced ER-Golgi trafficking and oligomerization of ATF6\u03b1 are regulated by its stress-sensing lumenal domain. Thus the ATF6\u03b1 ER-lumenal sensor domain would respond to stress in the ER by conversion from an oligomer to a monomer that would allow the information to be transmitted across the membrane to the cytosolic side initiating interactions with the COPII trafficking machinery. Among signaling transmembrane proteins there is precedence for conformational changes on one side of the bilayer leading to subsequent changes on the other side \u2013 notably for SCAP, the cholesterol sensor / trafficking adaptor of SREBP (<a href=\"#bib14\">Sun et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Motamed et al., 2011</a>), but also for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Endres et al., 2013</a>).

These two principles are not mutually exclusive, as previously reconciled for the activation principles of IRE1 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pincus et al., 2010</a>). Evidence for activation by ligand binding comes from models of physiological ER stress in cardiac cells. In this system, ER stress induces expression of thrombospondin (Thbs4), which then binds to the lumenal domain of ATF6\u03b1 and activates ATF6\u03b1 signaling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>). As with IRE1, ATF6\u03b1 may bind newly accumulating misfolded proteins directly as ligands to activate signaling (<a href=\"#bib41\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>). We envision that Ceapins act as antagonists to prevent such binding and stabilize ATF6\u03b1 in its inactive state."

First, the authors make clear that the direct molecular target of Ceapins remains unknown. Most of these data were obtained by GFP-ATF6\u03b1, which are convincing. Importantly, the authors analyze endogenous ATF6\u03b1 using specific antibodies. Here, the data are somewhat different than recombinant overexpressed GFP-ATF6\u03b1. Instead of the diffuse distribution of GFP-ATF6\u03b1 in resting cells, endogenous ATF6\u03b1 displayed a wide ER distribution as small puncta. In the presence of Ceapin-A7, the distribution did not change much from control except that there was no shift to the Golgi/nucleus following ER stress. The authors also performed the classic Brefeldin A treatment to retrieve S1P and S2P to the ER where they processed ATF6\u03b1 in the presence of Ceapins. The authors propose a model by which Ceapin molecules prevent the activation of ATF6\u03b1 by causing it maintain clusters/aggregates in the ER and that prevent their partitioning into COPII vesicle budding sites upon ER stress."
