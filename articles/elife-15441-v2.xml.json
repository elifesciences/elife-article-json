Where and how this capacity is implemented in the brain are unresolved questions. We show that auditory cortex stores information by persistent changes of neural activity. We separated activity related to working memory from activity related to other mental processes by having humans and monkeys perform different tasks with varying working memory demands on the same sound sequences. Working memory was reflected in the spiking activity of individual neurons in auditory cortex and in the activity of neuronal populations, that is, in local field potentials and magnetic fields. Our results provide direct support for the idea that temporary storage of information recruits the same brain areas that also process the information. Because similar activity was observed in the two species, the cellular bases of some auditory working memory processes in humans can be studied in monkeys."

Where and how this capacity is implemented in the brain are unresolved questions. We show that auditory cortex stores information by persistent changes of neural activity. We separated activity related to working memory from activity related to other mental processes by having humans and monkeys perform different tasks with varying working memory demands on the same sound sequences. Working memory was reflected in the spiking activity of individual neurons in auditory cortex and in the activity of neuronal populations, that is, in local field potentials and magnetic fields. Our results provide direct support for the idea that temporary storage of information recruits the same brain areas that also process the information. Because similar activity was observed in the two species, the cellular bases of some auditory working memory processes in humans can be studied in monkeys."

The information can be related to past sensory events (e.g., short-term sensory memory), or to future sensory events (e.g., sensory prediction) or actions. The two types of information have been termed the retrospective and prospective codes, respectively, and both can be stored in WM to bridge sensory events or their contingent behavioral actions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Curtis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">D\u2019Esposito, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Postle, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sreenivasan et al., 2014</a>). Research on WM has promoted the view that the storage is accomplished by sustained attention to internal representations of information (<a href=\"#bib1\">Awh and Jonides, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chun, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gazzaley and Nobre, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kiyonaga and Egner, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Postle, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zimmermann et al., 2016</a>). It is further assumed that WM arises through the coordinated recruitment, via attention, of brain areas in a broad network (<a href=\"#bib12\">Constantinidis and Procyk, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Postle, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ranganath and D'Esposito, 2005</a>) and that the task-relevant information is stored in some of the same brain areas that also process it, such as sensory cortex, whereas prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to aid storage of the information in sensory cortex (<a href=\"#bib17\">D\u2019Esposito, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Postle, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sreenivasan et al., 2014</a>)."

Although some of these studies have demonstrated neural activity in AC that is persistently elevated or suppressed during the period when information needs to be held in WM, we argue here that such persistent changes in activity do not unequivocally reflect WM. Many studies have not controlled for potential long-lasting neural activity evoked by a stimulus and for mental processes other than WM that are associated with performing a task, such as general attention, reward expectation or preparation for behavioral responses. These processes can also be associated with changes in AC activity that last for seconds (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brosch et al., 2011</a>). For example, in some of the imaging (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kumar et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Linke and Cusack, 2015</a>) and recording studies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bigelow et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gottlieb et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Scott et al., 2014</a>), persistent changes in activity were revealed by comparing activity during the WM period with that during a baseline period. However, these two periods differed not only in WM but also with respect to the expectation of upcoming stimuli and of rewards, and with respect to preparation for behavioral responses. Therefore, the persistent changes in activity revealed in these studies do not necessarily reflect WM. They could reflect expectation and preparation. In some other studies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Grimault et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nolden et al., 2013</a>), the persistent changes in activity were revealed by comparing activity in experimental conditions with different WM load. However, in these studies, the auditory stimuli always co-varied with the WM load across conditions. Therefore, differences in the persistent activity revealed in these studies could reflect differences in activity evoked by different stimuli rather than differences in WM load. Moreover, it is unclear whether persistent changes in neural activity in AC are stimulus specific (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gottlieb et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kumar et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lemus et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Linke and Cusack, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Linke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">R\u00e4m\u00e4 et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Scott et al., 2014</a>), even though stimulus specificity has been traditionally considered a hallmark of WM in sensory cortex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Curtis and Lee, 2010</a>). Furthermore, with few recent exceptions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Grimault et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nolden et al., 2013</a>), human studies have not attempted to localize neural activity related to the performance of auditory WM tasks (e.g., <a href=\"#bib26\">Guimond et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kaiser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lu et al., 1992</a>). Thus, it is still an open question whether AC exhibits persistent changes in neural activity related to auditory WM."

They were designed to separate neural activity in AC related to WM from potential late activity evoked by S1 or activity related to mental processes other than WM. They also allowed examination of the stimulus specificity of WM-related activity in AC. In humans, we assessed neural activity in AC by means of magnetoencephalography (MEG), through which we determined the strengths of regional sources (<a href=\"#bib59\">Scherg and Ebersole, 1993</a>). In monkeys, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and spike activity from core fields of AC. To track potential contributions from other brain structures, particularly from PFC, we not only compared LFPs and spike activity in core fields of AC but also recorded spike activity in PFC."

For tasks 1, 2, 3 and 6, four sequences (AA, AB, BA and BB) were used. A and B represent tones of different frequencies. For task 4, S1 and S2 were tones of three different frequencies, A, B or C. For task 5, S1 was also a tone (of frequency A, B or C), whereas S2 was a noise burst (D), a frequency-modulated tone (E) or a click train (F). (<b>a</b>) Tasks 1 and 2 required a go response for sequence AA and a nogo response for the other sequences. The WM load was higher when S1 was A (thick orange traces) than when it was B (thin blue traces). Tasks 1 and 2 differed with respect to the hand used for the responses. Putative WM-related activity was identified by a within-task comparison. (<b>b</b>) Task 6 required a go response for sequence BB and a nogo response for the other sequences. The partial changes of stimulus-response associations relative to those of task 1 enabled WM-related activity to be revealed also by between-task comparisons. (<b>c</b>) Task 3, a delayed-response task, required a go response when S1 was A and a nogo response when it was B, irrespective of the frequency of S2. Potential differences in activity related to preparation for go and nogo responses could be revealed by comparing activity during the delay of trials requiring go responses (thin orange traces) and nogo responses (thin blue traces).

(<b>e</b>) Task 5, a sound-discrimination task, required a go response when S2 was the noise burst and a nogo response when S2 was the click train or the frequency-modulated tone, irrespective of the frequency of S1. WM-related activity was revealed by comparing activity during the delay in tasks 4 and 5. Feedback of whether the response was correct or not was provided to the human subjects in tasks 4 and 5 and to the monkeys in tasks 1 and 6. The human subjects were shown a smiling face immediately after a correct response and a frowning face after an incorrect response. For the monkeys, a drop of water was provided immediately after correct go and nogo responses."

The two tasks differed with respect to the index finger used for the go response: the right for task 1 and the left for task 2. They also differed with respect to the ear stimulated: the left for task 1 and the right for task 2, contralateral to the finger used. The tasks thus controlled for potential differential effects of the side of auditory stimulation and execution of the behavioral response and allowed the investigation of whether both the left and right AC are involved in auditory WM. In order to solve tasks 1 and 2, subjects first had to identify the frequency of S1 because it determined how the remainder of the trial needed to be processed. When S1 was B, a nogo response was required, irrespective of S2, and nothing else needed to be held in WM. When S1 was A, however, subjects remained uncertain whether a go or a nogo response would be required after S2. To cope with this uncertainty, they could use different strategies involving WM. For example, they could hold in WM the two possible associations between S2 and the behavioral response (a go response when S2 was A and a nogo response when it was B), and then make the appropriate response after identifying S2. Or they could hold in WM the frequency of S1, compare it with that of S2, and then make a go or a nogo response depending on whether S2 was identical to or different from S1, respectively. Irrespective of the strategies subjects utilized, WM was involved during the delay between S1 and S2 in each trial. The random presentation of the four sequences, AA, AB, BA and BB, prevented the predictability of the sequence in the upcoming trial and, consequently, the information required for making a correct response needed to be stored and updated on a trial-by-trial basis, that is, in WM on a scale of seconds (<a href=\"#bib22\">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</a>). Because more information needed to be stored during the delay in trials when S1 was A than when it was B, the WM load during delay was higher in the former than in the latter trials. In the following, these trials are referred to as high- and low-WM-load trials, respectively."

They could also result from differences in WM-unrelated activity that is evoked by S1 but outlasts it (<i>late activity</i>) or from differences related to preparing for a possibly required go response within a limited time window after S2 in high-WM-load trials rather than for the nogo response in low-WM-load trials (<i>preparatory activity</i>). To distinguish between these possibilities, the same subjects also performed task 3 on the same stimuli and used the same finger as in task 1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Task 3 was a delayed-response task in which subjects had to hold in WM that, irrespective of the identity of S2, a go response after S2 was required when S1 was A and a nogo response was required when S1 was B. If differences in activity during the delay in task 1 were only due to differences in late activity or in preparatory activity, then the differences in activity between the high- and low-WM-load trials in task 1 should be very similar to the differences between the go and nogo trials in task 3. If, however, such a similarity is not observed, then the differences in activity during the delay in task 1 (and by inference task 2) are at least partly due to differences in WM load."

We contrasted a conventional delayed-match-to-sample task (task 4) with a sound-discrimination task (task 5). In task 4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>), tones of three different frequencies (A, B and C) were used as S1 and S2. A go response was required when the frequencies of S1 and S2 were identical and a nogo response otherwise. Subjects could solve this task by using similar strategies as in tasks 1 and 2 of study 1 for trials starting with A. All trials in task 4 constituted high-WM-load trials and a third of them required go responses. Task 5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>) required a go response when S2 had a specific identity and a nogo response otherwise, irrespective of the identity of S1. This specific S2 occurred on one third of the trials so that the proportions of go and nogo trials and, thus, the proportion of trials on which subject prepared for one or the other motor responses, were the same as in task 4. The WM load during the delay between S1 and S2 in task 5 was lower than that in task 4 and therefore all trials in task 5 were considered to be low-WM-load trials. For S1 in task 5, the same tones A, B and\u00a0C were used as in task 4. Unlike in task 4, acoustic stimuli different from pure tones were used as S2: a noise burst (D), a click train (E), and a frequency-modulated tone (F).

This suggests that levels of general attention in tasks 4 and 5 were similar during the presentation of S1 because the peak amplitude of the M100 component is strongly modulated by attention (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kauram\u00e4ki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Woldorff et al., 1993</a>). Because tasks 4 and 5 differed in WM load, but not in S1 or in the proportions of go and nogo trials, we conclude that the differences in source strengths during the delay between the two tasks were due to differences in WM load and that activity in both ACs can be related to WM."

Task 1 was equivalent to task 1 performed by the human subjects. It required a go response (a bar release) for the sequence AA and a nogo response (withholding a bar release) for the other three sequences AB, BA and BB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Our analyses of the behavioral data (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) indicated that the monkeys solved the task utilizing WM and not solely by means of other strategies. Therefore, the WM load during the delay was higher in trials when S1 was A than when it was B (for detailed reasoning, see the second paragraph in Section Experimental overview and rationale)."

Task 6 required a go response for the sequence BB and a nogo response for the other three sequences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). We contrasted task 1 with task 6, rather than with a delayed-response task (task 3), because the reversal of WM load also allowed addressing the stimulus-specificity of WM-related activity. To further examine potential sources of differences in activity during the delay of high- and low-WM-load trials, the same set of stimuli was also presented to the two monkeys while they did not perform the tasks (<i>passive trained condition</i>). The stimuli were also presented to a third, untrained, monkey (<i>passive untrained condition</i>)."

If, at a given recording site in core fields of AC, differences in activity during the delay between these trials were only due to late activity that was evoked by S1 but outlasted it, one would expect very similar differences in task 1, in task 6, and in the passive conditions. If the differences were only due to preparatory activity, one would expect opposite differences in tasks 1 and 6 and no differences in the passive conditions. Therefore, if the differences were observed in only one task but not in the other, they would be due to differences in WM load and thus indicate WM-related activity. As a second method of identifying WM-related activity, we compared trials starting with the same tone but taken from different tasks (<i>between-task comparison</i>). Results of this method (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) were consistent with those of the first method. As a third method of identifying WM-related activity, we compared high- and low-WM-load trials with regard to activity differences between the delay and the baseline within the same trial. In addition to WM-related activity, this method also revealed how the neuronal activity varied in an ongoing trial with WM load."

Significant high-/low-load spike-rate ratios occurred in only one of the two tasks in the majority of the units and in both tasks in the minority of the units (65% vs. 35% for multiunits and 92% vs. 8% for single units; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). These proportions were significantly different from those expected if the significant spike-rate ratios were only due to differences in late or preparatory activity (i.e., 0% vs. 100%; p&lt;0.001, chi-square test, one-tailed). The occurrence of significant spike-rate ratios in only one of the two tasks was related to the units\u2019 best frequencies (for details of the assessment of the best frequency, see Sections Behavioral paradigms and Electrophysiological recordings and data analysis). Significant spike-rate ratios only in task 1 occurred more frequently in units with a best frequency of \u223c3 kHz (2.67\u20133.37 kHz) than in other units (26.7% vs. 9.4%; p&lt;0.05, chi-square test, one-tailed). Significant spike-rate ratios only in task 6 occurred more frequently in units with a best frequency of \u223c1 kHz (0.89\u20131.12 kHz) than in other units (30.1% vs. 15.4%; p&lt;0.05). Tasks 1 and 6 had reversed WM loads for sequences starting with A and with B. Therefore, the task specificity of the occurrence of significant spike-rate ratios in most units is equivalent to a stimulus specificity, that is, the differences emerged only when either A or B (or the S2-response associations) had to be held in WM. We thus argue that in the majority of units, those displaying the task and stimulus specificity, the differences in the spike rate during the delay of high- and low-WM-load trials were due to differences in WM load. Thus, 30.0% (92/307) of the multiunits and 21.7% (33/152) of the single units in core fields of AC were considered to exhibit WM-related spike activity."

For this purpose, we analyzed LFPs in core fields of AC, which were simultaneously recorded along with the spike activity in core fields of AC, and spike activity in PFC, which was recorded in separate sessions in monkey C. LFPs in core fields of AC partly reflect synaptic inputs to core fields of AC, and PFC has been hypothesized to exert a top-down modulation of activity in sensory cortex to aid storage of information (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sreenivasan et al., 2014</a>)."

These differences emerged shortly after S1 and persisted until the end of the delay. LFP differences were computed by subtracting the amplitude in the low-WM-load trials from that in the high-WM-load trials (<i>high- \u2013 low-load LFP difference</i>). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a> shows the distributions of these differences during the final 500 ms of the 800-ms delay (green dots and traces) and during baseline (black dots and traces) for all 310 sites from both monkeys combined. Similar to the results obtained with spike activity, significant LFP differences occurred more frequently during the delay than during baseline (p&lt;0.001, chi-square test, one-tailed). The frequency of occurrence of significant LFP differences during the delay also depended on the behavioral context, being significantly higher (p&lt;0.001, chi-square test, one-tailed) when the monkeys performed the tasks correctly (25.5% and 27.1% in tasks 1 and 6, respectively) than when they made errors (13.5% and 7.9%) or than in the responses to the corresponding sequences when the monkeys did not perform the tasks in the passive condition (8.3% and 9.3%; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>). Significant LFP differences during the delay were also observed more often when the monkeys performed the tasks correctly than in the responses to the corresponding sequences in the untrained naive monkey (3.5% and 1.7%; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>). Also mirroring the spike activity, significant LFP differences occurred in only one of the two tasks at the majority of sites (107 of the 135 sites with a significant LFP difference in one or both tasks; 79%) and in both tasks at the minority of sites (28 of 135; 21%; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Based on these results, we conclude that at 107 of 310 sites (34.5%) the LFP differences between high- and low-WM-load trials were due to differences in WM load. Thus, task-relevant information is also stored in the synaptic potentials in core fields of AC. As with spike activity, we found that LFPs were persistently different during the delay, such that at some sites LFPs were more positive in high- than in low-WM-load trials (left panel in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>), and at other sites more negative (right panel in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>). Both effects were observed at many sites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,d</a>), unlike in the case of the spike activity where increases in spike rate with WM load were much more common than decreases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c,d</a>)."

This part of PFC has been shown to play an essential role in auditory WM tasks (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hwang and Romanski, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Plakke and Romanski, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Plakke et al., 2015</a>).

Like in core fields of AC, neurons in vlPFC could discharge significantly more spikes (p&lt;0.05, permutation test) during the delay of high- than of low-WM-load trials (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>) or vice versa (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). We observed that, compared to core fields of AC, a similar proportion of multiunits in vlPFC displayed high-/low-load spike-rate ratios during the delay differing significantly from 1. Also, there was a similar dependence of the occurrence of significant high-/low-load spike-rate ratios on the behavioral context (cf. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6c</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4c</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6e</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4e</a>), and a similar task or stimulus specificity (cf. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6d</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4d</a>). These results indicate WM-related activity also in vlPFC. Unlike in core fields of AC, where overall enhancement during the delay dominated and spike rates predominantly changed in high-WM-load trials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f,g</a>), in vlPFC suppression was as common as, or even more common than, enhancement during the delay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d,f,g</a>). Spike rates also frequently changed in low-WM-load trials, and sometimes even more strongly than in high-WM-load trials (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6f,g</a>). The conjecture in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> fits this finding."

Activity in AC is not only related to processing the sounds and the other context-relevant stimuli but also to mental processes associated with performing a task such as selection of and preparation for behavioral actions, and expectation of rewards (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brosch et al., 2011</a>).

In the second approach (study 3), we compared differences in activity between trials that differed in WM load in one task with differences in activity between trials that also differed in WM load, but in a reversed fashion, in another task. This further enabled the determination of the stimulus-specificity of the effect of WM load. In the third approach (study 2), we directly compared activity in trials which differed only in WM load. Our approaches have the potential to single out other types of WM-related activity including rhythmic activities and spatiotemporal activation patterns and could be used in other sensory modalities. They can also be adapted to tease out activity related to other cognitive and motivational processes. However, note that the second approach requires stimulus-specificity of the neural activity under consideration. It may be difficult to demonstrate such stimulus-specificity in gross measures of the electrical activity of large neural populations, such as EEG and MEG."

These ways of storing information in AC are similar to those considered for visual (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fuster and Jervey, 1982</a>), somatosensory (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhou and Fuster, 1996</a>), and prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Reinhart et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wilson et al., 1994</a>).

In the LFPs, effects of other mental processes seem larger, because at many sites LFPs changed during the delay even in low-WM-load trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5g</a>). This is consistent with the large increase of source strength during the delay relative to baseline in our MEG studies, which was only slightly smaller in low- than in high-WM-load trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). LFPs and magnetic fields have been considered to partially reflect inputs to a region of tissue, in contrast to spike activity, which has been considered to preferentially reflect output to connected areas (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buzs\u00e1ki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen et al., 1993</a>).

The storage in AC of information about sounds over several seconds may be an essential component of the analysis of temporal patterns of sounds including speech and communication sounds (<a href=\"#bib42\">May et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Petkov and Jarvis, 2012</a>). The WM-related persistent activity changes described here reflect active processes recruited when subjects are engaged in WM tasks. Because the change of the neural activity persisted throughout most of the period during which information needed to be stored, it is conceivable that the memory trace carried by this activity remains relatively unaltered throughout the memory period. Whether persistent activity changes in AC also support the storage of information for even longer periods and other WM processes, including spatial aspects and processes requiring modifications of stored information, is not clear and is under debate (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fritz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Scott and Mishkin, 2016</a>). Because very similar persistent WM-related activity was observed in our studies in the AC of humans and monkeys, the cellular bases of some auditory WM processes in humans can well be studied in monkeys."

The corrected signal was then segmented into 3-s epochs, ranging from 500 ms before the onset of S1 to 500 ms after the onset of S2. Epochs contaminated with other artifacts were discarded (for details, see <a href=\"#bib68\">Zacharias et al., 2011</a>). For each subject, task and sensor, the remaining artifact-free epochs were band-pass filtered (high-pass DC, low-pass 30\u2009Hz, zero phase, 24 dB/octave). Average waveforms were obtained by arithmetically averaging the signals from epochs of trials with correct responses, separately for each subject, task and sensor.

Separately for each subject and task, we modeled the neuronal sources underlying the magnetic field distribution around the peak of the M100 component evoked by S1 by two regional sources, one in the left and one in the right AC. These regional sources were seeded at the border of Heschl\u2019s gyrus and planum temporale (<a href=\"#bib47\">N\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen and Picton, 1987</a>). In addition, we seeded three pairs of regional sources roughly symmetrically in left and right central, frontal and occipital cortical areas (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) to model background activity, that is, to exclude potential confounds from other brain areas. These three pairs of sources were located close to the cortical surface such that their distances to the source in the AC of the same hemisphere were relatively large. We did so to minimize the mutual influence between the signals of these sources and of the sources in AC because the mutual influence decreases with increasing distance between the sources. In contrast to the positions of the sources, their orientations and amplitudes were fitted to best account for the magnetic field distribution of the average waveforms at all sensors using the spherical volume conductor model as head model (<a href=\"#bib60\">Scherg, 1990</a>).

By means of the built-in spike detection tools of the data acquisition systems (threshold crossings and spike duration), we discriminated the action potentials of a few neurons (multiunit) from each electrode and stored the time stamp and the waveform of each action potential. Single unit activity was extracted off-line from the multiunit recordings by means of principal component analysis. The position of A1 was estimated using the spatial distribution of the units\u2019 best frequencies and the penetration traces of the electrodes, i.e., electrodes passed through parietal cortex into the auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brosch et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kaas and Hackett, 2000</a>). The vlPFC was identified by its anatomical location (below the principal sulcus and anterior to the arcuate sulcus; <a href=\"#bib55\">Romanski and Goldman-Rakic, 2002</a>) and by the latency and selectivity of neuronal responses for complex auditory stimuli (animal and human vocalizations, natural sounds, man-made sounds, and white noise). This follows the observation of <a href=\"#bib55\">Romanski and Goldman-Rakic (2002)</a> that auditory neurons were tightly clustered in a small region of vlPFC outside of which no auditory neurons were found. We also found that neuronal activity in the vlPFC could be synchronized with that in auditory cortex, following the observation of <a href=\"#bib56\">Romanski et al., (1999)</a> that the vlPFC reciprocally connected with auditory cortex."

For each unit, the best frequency was assessed by analyzing the responses to the 40 pure tones as described by <a href=\"#bib4\">Brosch et al., (1999)</a>."

The authors go to great lengths to rule out a contribution of other factors, specifically persistent sound-driven activity and activity preparatory to making a motor response. Furthermore, the combination of recordings from human and non-human primates is a strength of the study. This manuscript therefore provides evidence of working memory encoding within sensory cortex, corroborating other recent findings and indicating that the temporary storage of information likely recruits the same brain areas that process this information."

Indeed, we referred to the same two strategies in our original manuscript but used different terminologies, namely, the strategy of storing stimulus-response associations of S2 and the strategy of storing the frequency of S1. We would like to emphasize again that also with the \u2018discrimination learning\u2019 strategy, subjects needed to utilize working memory after S1. This is so because they would have had to remember and update rules on a trial-by-trial basis or, using the reviewers\u2019 terms, \u2018remember to apply\u2019 specific rules after specific S1s. For example, in task 1, when S1 was A, the rule to be remembered was to make a go response if S2 was A and a nogo response if S2 was B, which comprised two stimulus-response associations. When S1 was B, the rule to be remembered was to make a nogo response, a single stimulus-response association independent of the identity of S2. Therefore, trials where S1 was A and trials where S1 was B differed in working memory load during the delay between S1 and S2. We thus respectfully disagree with the reviewers' concern that 'working memory load does not necessarily have to be higher during the delay if a learned rule is applied'.

However, a growing number of psychological and neuroscientific studies have revealed extensive overlap between these two concepts, inspiring numerous reviews and discussions about the relationship between working memory and attention as well as theories of working memory. One prevailing view is that working memory and attention share the same mechanism of prioritization of processing. Prioritization of processing is traditionally considered a hallmark of working memory when it is directed toward internal representations, and of selective attention when directed toward external stimuli (e.g., Kiyonaga and Egner, 2013; Gazzaley and Nobre, 2012). Recent influential theories of working memory directly consider working memory as internal attention sustained over time and assert that selective attention is the mechanism by which information is stored in working memory (e.g., Awh and Jonides, 2001; Chun, 2011; Postle, 2006). Although these theories have been based mainly on visual studies, evidence has also emerged from auditory studies (for example, see: Backer and Alain, J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 38: 1554-1566, 2012; Backer et al., J. Neurosci. 35: 1307-1318, 2015; Green and McKeown, Percept. Psychophys. 69: 942-951, 2007). A few studies have shown an interplay between attention and auditory memory in the way that attention can be directed to memory traces and that existing memory can guide attention (for an example review, see Zimmermann et al., 2016)."

The use of these probe sources is crucial, because otherwise AC sources could reflect activity not only in AC but also, to a certain extent, outside AC. All probe sources were placed very close to the cortical surface such that their distances to the AC source of the same hemisphere were relatively large.

Our point has been confirmed by BESA and has been in the company\u2019s issue tracking list (issue #370).

Fortunately, the corrected results are very similar to those presented in our original manuscript and provide an even more clear-cut support for our conclusions. In particular, there are no longer significant differences in neural activity during the delay between go and nogo trials in task 3. This means that the differences in activity between high- and low-WM-load trials in tasks 1 and 2 cannot be accounted for by differences in preparatory activity. Thus, there is no need to further investigate activity in motor or premotor cortex.
