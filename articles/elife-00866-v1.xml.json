Whenever we recognize and use an object, our brain automatically accesses a wealth of background knowledge about the object\u2019s structure, properties and functions, and about the movements associated with its use. We are also constantly observing our own actions as we engage with objects, as well as those of others. A key question is: how are these distinct types of information, which are distributed across different regions of the brain, integrated in the service of everyday behavior? Addressing this question involves specifying the internal organizational structure of the representations of each type of information, as well as the way in which information is exchanged or combined across different regions. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Jody Culham at the University of Western Ontario (UWO) and co-workers report a significant advance in our understanding of these \u2018big picture\u2019 issues by showing how a specific type of information about object-directed actions is coded across the brain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Gallivan et al., 2013b</a>)."

Visuomotor processing in support of object-directed action, such as reaching and grasping, is represented in dorsal occipital and posterior parietal regions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Culham et al., 2003</a>). Knowledge about how to manipulate objects according to their function is represented in inferior-lateral parietal cortex, and in premotor regions of the frontal lobe (<a href=\"#bib3\">Culham et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Johnson-Frey, 2004</a>)."

Some brain regions code for planned actions that involve the hands but not tools (red), and others for actions that involve tools but not the hands (blue). A third set of regions codes for actions involving either the hands or tools, but uses different neural representations for each (pink). A final set of areas code the type of action to be performed, distinguishing between reaching towards an object as opposed to grasping it, irrespective of whether a tool or the hands alone are used (purple). The red lines represent the frontoparietal network implicated in hand actions, with the short dashes showing the subnetwork involved in reaching, and the long dashes, the subnetwork involved in grasping. The blue solid lines show the network implicated in tool use, while the green line connects areas comprising a subset of the perception network."

They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brains of subjects performing a task in which they had to alternate between using their hands or a set of pliers to reach towards or grasp an object. Ingeniously, the pliers were reverse pliers\u2014constructed so that the business end opens when you close your fingers, and closes when your fingers open. This made it possible to dissociate the goal of each action (e.g., \u2018grasp\u2019) from the movements involved in its execution (since in the case of the pliers, \u2018grasping\u2019 is accomplished by opening the hand)."

In addition, they sought to identify three classes of brain regions: those that code grasping of objects with the hand (but not the pliers), those that code grasping of objects with the pliers (but not the hand), and those that have a common code for grasping with both the hand and the pliers (that is, a code for grasping that is independent of the specific movements involved)."

In other words, they examined where in the brain the \u2018intention\u2019 to move is represented. Specifically, they asked: which brain regions distinguish between intentions corresponding to different types of object-directed actions? They found that certain regions decode upcoming actions of the hand but not the pliers (superior-parietal/occipital cortex and lateral occipital cortex), whereas other regions decode upcoming actions involving the pliers but not the hand (supramarginal gyrus and left posterior middle temporal gyrus). A third set of regions uses a common code for upcoming actions of both the hands and the pliers (subregions of the intraparietal sulcus and premotor regions of the frontal lobe)."

Moreover, a previous paper from Gallivan and colleagues reported that upcoming hand actions (grasping versus reaching with the fingers) can be decoded in regions of ventral and lateral temporal-occipital cortex that were independently defined as showing differential BOLD responses for different categories of objects (e.g., objects, scenes, body parts; <a href=\"#bib4\">Gallivan et al., 2013a</a>). Furthermore, the regions of lateral occipital cortex that respond specifically to images of hands are directly adjacent to those that respond specifically to images of tools, and also exhibit strong functional connectivity with areas of somatomotor cortex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bracci et al., 2012</a>)."

An exciting issue raised by this study is the degree to which tools may have multiple levels of representation across different brain regions: some regions seem to represent tools as extensions of the human body (<a href=\"#bib7\">Iriki et al., 1996</a>), while other regions represent them as discrete objects to be acted upon by the body. The work of Gallivan et al. suggests a new way of understanding how these different representations of tools are combined in the service of everyday behavior."
