However, the role of alternative splicing (AS) in the temporal control of cell cycle is not well understood. By sequencing the human transcriptome through two continuous cell cycles, we identify ~1300 genes with cell cycle-dependent AS changes. These genes are significantly enriched in functions linked to cell cycle control, yet they do not significantly overlap genes subject to periodic changes in steady-state transcript levels. Many of the periodically spliced genes are controlled by the SR protein kinase CLK1, whose level undergoes cell cycle-dependent fluctuations via an auto-inhibitory circuit. Disruption of CLK1 causes pleiotropic cell cycle defects and loss of proliferation, whereas CLK1 over-expression is associated with various cancers. These results thus reveal a large program of CLK1-regulated periodic AS intimately associated with cell cycle control."

However, the role of alternative splicing (AS) in the temporal control of cell cycle is not well understood. By sequencing the human transcriptome through two continuous cell cycles, we identify ~1300 genes with cell cycle-dependent AS changes. These genes are significantly enriched in functions linked to cell cycle control, yet they do not significantly overlap genes subject to periodic changes in steady-state transcript levels. Many of the periodically spliced genes are controlled by the SR protein kinase CLK1, whose level undergoes cell cycle-dependent fluctuations via an auto-inhibitory circuit. Disruption of CLK1 causes pleiotropic cell cycle defects and loss of proliferation, whereas CLK1 over-expression is associated with various cancers. These results thus reveal a large program of CLK1-regulated periodic AS intimately associated with cell cycle control."

As a cell progresses through the cell cycle, it must carefully regulate its gene activity to switch particular genes on or off at specific moments. When a gene is activated its sequence is first copied into a temporary molecule called a transcript. These transcripts are then edited to form templates to build proteins. One way that a transcript can be edited is via a process called alternative splicing, in which different pieces of the transcript are cut and pasted together to form different versions of the final template. This allows different instructions to be obtained from a single gene, introducing an added layer of biological complexity. However, the role of alternative splicing in the timing of key events of the cell life cycle is not well understood."

The sequences of gene transcripts produced within human cells were collected while the cells went through two rounds of division. This approach revealed that around 1,300 genes are spliced in different ways at different stages of each cell cycle. Many of these genes were known to play roles in controlling the cell\u2019s life cycle, but few of the genes showed large changes in the amount of total transcript that is generated over time."

The production of CLK1 is itself carefully controlled throughout the cell cycle, and the enzyme\u2019s activity prevents its own overproduction. Further experiments showed that blocking CLK1\u2019s activity while a cell is replicating its DNA halts the cell cycle, but blocking this enzyme\u2019s activity after the cell had replicated its DNA did not. Given this pivotal role in the cell cycle, Dominguez et al. also examined the role of CLK1 in cancer cells and found that high levels of CLK1 in tumours were linked to lower survival rates. These findings indicate that CLK1 warrants further investigation, particularly in relation to its role in cancer."

AS is tightly controlled, and its mis-regulation is a common cause of human diseases (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wang and Cooper, 2007</a>). Generally, AS is regulated by <i>cis</i>-acting splicing regulatory elements that recruit <i>trans-</i>acting splicing factors to promote or inhibit splicing (<a href=\"#bib34\">Matera and Wang, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang and Burge, 2008</a>).

Consistent with these findings, several splicing factors function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Karni et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), and cancer-specific splicing alterations often affect genes that function in cell cycle control (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tsai et al., 2015</a>)."

These periodic AS events belong to a set of genes that is largely separate from the set of genes periodically regulated during the cell cycle at the transcript level, yet the AS regulated set is significantly enriched in cell cycle- associated functions. We further demonstrate that a significant fraction of the periodic AS events is regulated by the SR protein kinase, CLK1, and that CLK itself is also subject to cell cycle-dependent regulation. Moreover, inhibition or depletion of CLK1 causes pleiotropic defects in mitosis that lead to cell death or G1/S arrest, suggesting that the temporal regulation of splicing by CLK1 is critical for cell cycle progression. The discovery of periodic AS thus reveals a widespread yet previously underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of gene function during the cell cycle."

To maximize the detection of regulated AS events, we used the complementary analysis pipelines, MISO and VAST-TOOLS (<a href=\"#bib26\">Katz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Irimia et al., 2014</a>). These pipelines have different detection specificities and employ partially overlapping reference sets of annotated AS events, and therefore afford a more comprehensive analysis when employed together.

Further supporting this conclusion, we did not observe a significant correlation (positive or negative) between exon PSI values and mRNA expression levels for genes with both periodic expression and periodic exon skipping (data not shown). A gene ontology (GO) analysis reveals that genes with periodic AS, like those with periodic transcript level changes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bar-Joseph et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Whitfield et al., 2002</a>), are significantly enriched in cell cycle-related functional categories, including M-phase, nuclear division and DNA metabolic process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; adjusted p&lt;0.05 for all listed categories, FDR&lt;10%) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Similar GO enrichment results were observed when removing the relatively small fraction (10%) of periodically spliced genes that also display significant mRNA expression changes across the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

We computationally corrected levels of fully spliced, protein coding <i>AURKB</i> mRNA by taking into account the fraction of intron-retaining (i.e. non-productive) transcripts across the cell cycle stages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The expression curve for corrected <i>AURKB</i> mRNA levels is substantially different from total <i>AURKB</i> transcript levels, with a shifted peak coinciding with mitosis. Periodically-regulated IR events detected in other genes, including those with known cell cycle functions such as HMG20B and RAD52, are similarly expected to affect the cell cycle timing of mRNA expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D</a>). Collectively, these results provide evidence that the temporal control of retained intron AS provides an important mechanism for establishing the timing of expression of AURKB mRNA and protein, as well as of the timing of expression of additional genes during the cell cycle."

Consistently, analysis of our RNA-seq data revealed 96 RNA binding proteins (RBPs) with periodic mRNA expression, including RS domain-containing factors like <i>SRSF2, SRSF8, TRA2A</i> and <i>SRSF6</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These 96 RBPs were significantly enriched in the GO term 'splicing regulation' (adjusted p=10<sup>-4</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating that periodic AS is likely controlled by multiple RBPs. Correlations between these RBPs and periodic splicing events were also identified (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). For example, SRSF2 expression is significantly correlated with the splicing pattern of a retained intron in the <i>SRSF2</i> transcript. Further supporting a role for these RBPs in controlling periodic splicing was the identification of RNA motifs bound by a subset of periodically expressed RBPs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). To further examine periodic RBP regulation during cell cycle, we measured the abundance of known splicing regulatory proteins at different stages of the cell cycle by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Among the proteins analyzed, CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1), an important regulator of the Ser/Arg (SR) repeat family of splicing regulators, displayed the strongest cyclic expression peaking at the G2/M phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), consistent with the results of a recent mass-spectrometry-based screen for cycling proteins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ly et al., 2014</a>). CLK1 is one of four human CLK paralogs (CLK1-4) and is known to regulate AS via altering the phosphorylation status of multiple SR proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Duncan et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jiang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ninomiya et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Prasad et al., 1999</a>).

The levels of total CLK1 mRNA, as well as the levels of specific CLK1 splice variants, did not change significantly during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>) indicating that periodic expression of CLK1 is controlled at the level of protein translation and/or turnover. Consistent with this, an exogenously expressed CLK1 protein displayed cell cycle-dependent fluctuations similar to those observed for endogenous CLK1 protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Moreover, CLK1 was rapidly degraded upon inhibition of translation by cycloheximide, and this effect was reversed by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Additionally, polyubiquitination of Flag-tagged CLK1 was detected following immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody from cells treated with MG132 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>).

CLK1 has been reported to auto-phosphorylate on several residues (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ben-David et al., 1991</a>). To investigate whether auto-phosphorylation of CLK1 affects its periodic regulation, we tested whether blocking its kinase activity affects its stability. Inhibition of CLK1 kinase activity using a selective inhibitor, TG003 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Muraki et al., 2004</a>), markedly stabilizes both endogenous and exogenously expressed CLK1 proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Moreover, activity-dependent destabilization of CLK1 was observed with a wild type (WT) protein, but not with a catalytically inactive (KD) mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left panel). We further observe that WT CLK1 is rapidly degraded upon cycloheximide treatment, whereas the KD mutant is more stable (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). We next tested whether CLK1 activity is sufficient to trigger its own degradation by co-expressing KD CLK1 with increasing amounts of WT CLK1. As expected, increasing amounts of WT CLK1 reduces levels of KD CLK1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Consistent with these results, WT CLK1 is more highly polyubiquitinated compared to the KD mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, compare lanes 2 to 4), and treatment with TG003 reduces polyubiquitination levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, lane 2 <i>vs.</i> 3 and lane 4 <i>vs.</i> 5). Decreased polyubiquitination of WT CLK1 is more prevalent than is apparent upon TG003 treatment, as CLK1 is stabilized by TG003 inhibition and thus more total Flag-CLK1 is immunoprecipitated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). To further examine whether this auto-feedback loop is required for changes in CLK1 protein levels during the cell cycle, we treated synchronized cells with TG003 (or DMSO as a control) and measured CLK1 protein levels. We observed that CLK1 inhibition prevents its turnover after the G2/M phase for both endogenous and exogenously expressed kinases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that CLK1 protein levels are controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in a cell cycle stage-specific manner, and that an activity-dependent negative feedback loop is required for this periodic regulation. These results further suggest that changes in the levels of CLK1 could account for many of the periodically regulated AS transitions we have detected during the cell cycle."

It is worth noting that TG003 can also inhibit CLK4 (although to a lesser extent than inhibition of CLK1). However, RNAi of CLK1 is sufficient to recapitulate the phenotype of CLK1/4 inhibition (see below and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fedorov et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Muraki et al., 2004</a>). Intron retention and cassette exons are the most overrepresented types of AS affected by TG003 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Most (70%) of the CLK1-regulated exons display increased skipping upon CLK1 inhibition, whereas 87% of CLK1-regulated introns show increased retention (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>), consistent with a recently reported role for CLK1 in the regulation of retained introns (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boutz et al., 2015</a>). Of nine analyzed TG003-affected AS events detected by RNA-Seq analysis, all were validated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These observations indicate that CLK1 inhibition mainly suppresses splicing, consistent with a general requirement for phosphorylation of SR proteins to promote splicing activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Irimia et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Prasad et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tsai et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, there is a significant overlap between genes with cell cycle periodic AS events (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and those with CLK1-regulated AS events, involving 156 genes (p=8.5\u00d710<sup>-10</sup>, hyper-geometric test). In contrast, consistent with the results in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, we do not observe a significant overlap between genes containing CLK1-regulated AS events and periodically expressed genes. These results thus support a widespread and rapidly acting role for CLK1 in controlling cell cycle-regulated AS. Indeed, CLK1 inhibition induces rapid (within 3\u20136\u2009hr) changes in AS among several analyzed cases (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

We detected a TG003 dose-dependent increase in <i>CHEK2</i> exon 9 inclusion, whereas overexpression of WT CLK1 induced exon 9 skipping, an event that removes the CHEK2 kinase domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Expression of WT CLK1 in the presence of TG003, or a catalytically inactive CLK1, had little to no effect on the splicing of this exon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, bottom panels), indicating that the catalytic activity of CLK1 is essential for regulating CHEK2 AS. Over-expression of the SR protein splicing regulator SRSF1, a known target of CLK1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Prasad et al., 1999</a>), had a similar effect as over-expression of CLK1, resulting in CHEK2 exon 9 skipping, whereas knockdown of SRSF1 had the opposite effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, right panel). Furthermore, the activation of CHEK2 requires homodimerization (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shen et al., 2004</a>), and we observe that the CHEK2 isoform lacking exon 9 still interacts with full-length protein (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), suggesting that this CLK1-regulated isoform may function in a dominant-negative manner to attenuate CHEK2 activity."

Inhibition of CLK1 rapidly shifts <i>CENPE</i> splicing to produce predominantly the long isoform (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), and this is accompanied by a reduction in <i>CENPE</i> protein levels during G2/M phase, presumably due to the instability of the long isoform (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

Knockdown of CLK1 using shRNAs led to an accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content in multiple cell types, specifically HeLa, H157, and A549 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), and the extent of this accumulation correlated with the degree of knockdown (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also observed a significant increase in multi-nucleation, a common consequence of defective chromosome segregation or cytokinesis, following shRNA-knockdown or TG003 inhibition of CLK1 in the treated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To visualize the effect of CLK1 inhibition on mitosis at a single cell level, we performed time-lapse high-content microscopy on live cells stably expressing a GFP-histone 2B fusion protein, to track changes in chromatin. TG003-treated cells entered mitosis normally, as measured by nuclear envelope breakdown, but displayed delayed or aberrant cytokinesis, typically resulting in multi-polar divisions, increased time in metaphase, failure to undergo chromatin de-condensation and eventual cell death (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media5\">5</a>). To further determine at what cell cycle stage CLK1 activity is required, we inhibited CLK1 using TG003 at different time points after early S phase release. Consistent with the imaging data, both control and TG003-treated cells entered mitosis normally, as measured by 4N DNA content. However, inhibition of CLK1 before late S-phase impaired progression through mitosis, whereas cells treated 5\u2009hr after early S phase release underwent a round of normal mitotic division, although failed to enter the next cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). These results suggest that the primary defects caused by CLK1 inhibition occur in late S-phase and G2 phase, which is when CLK1 levels normally begin to rise (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This conclusion is further supported by the observation that CLK1-dependent AS targets, such as those detected in <i>HMMR</i> and <i>CENPE,</i> are periodically expressed during cell cycle and peak during G2 and M phase (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Taken together with the earlier results, these data support an important and multifaceted role for CLK1 in the control of cell cycle progression through its function in the global regulation of periodic AS."

Supporting this, shRNA knockdown or chemical inhibition of CLK1 with TG003 or KHCB-19 in HeLa cells results in a near complete block in cell proliferation, as measured by anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation assays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>).

Consistently, most CLK1-controlled AS events that are altered in tumors have expected splicing changes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Furthermore, patients with tumors that have elevated CLK1 expression (i.e. the upper quartile of all samples) have significantly lower survival rates relative to other patients in the comparison group (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, p<i>=</i>0.007). While there was also an increase in CLK2, CLK3 and CLK4 mRNA expression in these tumors, CLK1 displayed the highest relative mRNA expression levels compared to CLK2 and CLK3 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Levels of the CLK4, which is ~80% identical to CLK1, did not correlate with survival differences despite its increased levels in tumors (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Consistent with this, CLK1-regulated AS events, as defined by the RNA-Seq analysis in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, were also altered across multiple tumor types, including breast, colon, lung and liver (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). These data are further consistent with a multi-faceted role for CLK1 in regulating cell cycle progression, and also suggest that CLK1 contributes to increased cell proliferation in cancer, at least in part through its role in controlling periodic AS."

                        "text": "Previous studies have shown that splicing and the cell cycle are intimately connected processes. Indeed, cell cycle division (CDC) loci originally defined in <i>S. cerevisiae,</i> namely <i>cdc5</i> and <i>cdc40</i>, were subsequently shown to encode spliceosomal components (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ben-Yehuda et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McDonald et al., 1999</a>). Moreover, genome-wide RNAi screens for new AS regulators of apoptosis genes in human cells revealed that factors involved in cell-cycle control, in addition to RNA processing components, were among the most significantly enriched hits (<a href=\"#bib38\">Moore et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tejedor et al., 2015</a>). An RNAi screen performed in <i>Drosophila</i> cells for genes required for cell-cycle progression identified numerous splicing components\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 2006</a>) as well as a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of CLK kinases, <i>Darkener of apricot Doa</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2004</a>). In other studies, negative control of splicing during M phase was shown to be dependent on dephosphorylation of the SR family protein, SRSF10 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shin and Manley, 2002</a>), and the mitotic regulator aurora kinase A (AURKA) was shown to control the AS regulatory activity of SRSF1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib38\">Moore et al., 2010</a>). Our study shows for the first time that AS patterns are subject to extensive periodic regulation, in part via a global control mechanism involving cell cycle fluctuations of the SR protein kinase CLK1. At least one likely function of this periodic AS regulation is to control the timing of activation of AURKB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), as well as of numerous other key cell cycle factors shown here to be subject to periodic AS. The definition of an extensive, periodically-regulated AS program in the present study thus opens the door to understanding the functions of an additional layer of regulation associated with cell cycle control and cancer."

                        "text": "Since many RBPs are found to be periodically expressed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), it is likely that other aspects of mRNA metabolism are also coordinated with cell cycle stages. For example, differential degradation could potentially contribute to the observed periodic fluctuation of splice isoforms during cell cycle. The degradation of mRNA is closely linked with alternative polyadenylation, which has emerged as a critical mechanism that controls mRNA translation and stability. Generally, shortened 3\u2019 UTRs are found in rapidly dividing cells and more aggressive cancers (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</a>). This study identified 94 cases periodic alternative poly-A site usage (data not shown) in genes known to regulate cell cycle and/or proliferation, including <i>SON, CENPF and EPCAM</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bomont et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chaves-Perez et al., 2013</a>). In addition, many mRNAs have recently been found to be translated in a cell cycle dependent fashion (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aviner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Maslon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stumpf et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, a fraction of periodically translated genes are also periodically spliced, including key regulators of cell cycle (e.g., <i>AURKA, AURKB, TTBK1</i> and <i>DICER1</i>). This observation is consistent with recent findings that the regulation of AS and translation may be coupled (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sterne-Weiler et al., 2013</a>). In summary, we have demonstrated that AS is subject to extensive temporal regulation during the cell cycle in a manner that appears to be highly integrated with orthogonal layers of cell cycle control. These results thus provide a new perspective on cell cycle regulation that should be taken into consideration when studying this fundamental biological process, both in the context of normal physiology and diseases including cancers."

Significance of overlapping gene sets was assessed using the hyper-geometric test. For overlap and correlation analysis between VAST-TOOLS and MISO we used two MISO AS event annotations (HG18 and HG19), due to differences in the input annotation files for these two pipelines. To identify the 4,343 overlapping exons in the heatmap, we used MISO hg19v1 annotations and MISO hg18 annotations, and the VAST-TOOLS annotations.

Altogether, these data suggests that temporal regulation of splicing by CLK1 is critical for cell cycle progression. Finally, the authors conclusively show that CLK1 is indeed required for normal mitosis and cell proliferation. The authors put forward a model whereby CLK1 has an essential role in controlling cell cycle-dependent AS."

However <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> argues little overlap between splicing regulation and mRNA expression levels, save for 133 overlapping events. Are the events in the overlap of periodic AS and periodic gene expression overrepresented for IR like in their example for AURKB and/or other PTC-introducing AS? The same could be done with CLK1 regulated AS and gene expression that is mentioned in the text later (paragraph one, subheading \u201cCLK1 regulates AS events in genes with critical roles in cell cycle control\u201d)."

Although the overlap is small, we addressed this point and show a table with the overlapping event types (see our response to the other comment #3 of this same reviewer). As you can see here, there is no specific enrichment for any of the four AS types shown here. As suggested by the reviewer the same overlap analysis was carried out for CLK1-regulated events."

An obvious mechanism that likely contributes to the observed periodic splicing changes is altered SR protein phosphorylation, particularly since SRSF1 doesn't change protein expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Can the authors use a phospho-RS-specific antibody (1H4?) to see if the phosphorylation state of any SR proteins is altered through the cell cycle and, if so, if any of these phosphorylation changes are deadened upon CLK1 inhibition with TG003?"

Boutz et al. (2014) and others cited within have described regulated intron retention (or \"detained introns\") of the upstream and downstream introns flanking CLK1 exon 4 that affects the transcript's localization and stability. Since periodic IR is suggested to be a common point of AS regulation through the cell cycle in this paper, showing that these introns are or are not retained across the cell cycle using additional primer sets, as was done for exon 4 skipping in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1B</a>, could further rule out splicing regulation or add another interesting layer of regulation controlling CLK1 in the context of the cell cycle. Indeed, the MISO analysis in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> calls IR in this region as one of the 1747 periodic splicing events (event: chr2:201726189-201725961:-@chr2:201724469-201724403:-) so this may very well be an additional layer of regulation upstream of the kinase-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated turnover that the authors convincingly demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>. Similarly, the authors could test and report results for variations of CLK1's 3'UTR."
