Here, we use genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors to directly probe the role of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in modulating calcineurin activity dynamics in insulin-secreting MIN6 \u03b2-cells. We show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations induce distinct temporal patterns of calcineurin activity in the cytosol and plasma membrane versus at the ER and mitochondria in these cells. Furthermore, we found that these differential calcineurin activity patterns are determined by variations in the subcellular distribution of calmodulin (CaM), indicating that CaM plays an active role in shaping both the spatial and temporal aspects of calcineurin signaling. Together, our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which oscillatory signals are decoded to generate specific functional outputs within different cellular compartments."
