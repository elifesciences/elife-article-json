The cytokine profile of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is hard-wired already during thymic development. Yet, the molecular pathways underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Here we show that signaling via the NF\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK) is essential for the formation of a fully functional \u03b3\u03b4 T cell compartment. In the absence of NIK, development of V\u03b35<sup>+</sup> dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) was halted in the embryonic thymus, and impaired NIK function caused a selective loss of IL-17 expression by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Using a novel conditional mutant of NIK, we could show in vivo that NIK signaling in thymic epithelial cells is essential for the thymic hardwiring of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell cytokine production."

The cytokine profile of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is hard-wired already during thymic development. Yet, the molecular pathways underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Here we show that signaling via the NF\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK) is essential for the formation of a fully functional \u03b3\u03b4 T cell compartment. In the absence of NIK, development of V\u03b35<sup>+</sup> dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) was halted in the embryonic thymus, and impaired NIK function caused a selective loss of IL-17 expression by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Using a novel conditional mutant of NIK, we could show in vivo that NIK signaling in thymic epithelial cells is essential for the thymic hardwiring of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell cytokine production."

However, while the essential role of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells and B cells for the induction of long-lasting protective immune responses is undisputed, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells due to their low abundance in peripheral lymphoid organs have been often ignored by the scientific community (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allison and Havran, 1991</a>). This has changed in the past decade, as it became evident that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are important players not only during protective immune reactions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lockhart et al., 2006</a>), but also in various models of autoimmune disease (<a href=\"#bib31\">Petermann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pantelyushin et al., 2012</a>)."

Most notably, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells recognize qualitatively different antigens. The scope of the potential antigens has not been revealed entirely, but known targets include non-classical MHC molecules (<a href=\"#bib40\">Strid et al., 2008</a>), phosophoantigens (<a href=\"#bib9\">Constant et al., 1994</a>) as well as a discrete set of non-self proteins (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zeng et al., 2012</a>). The second main characteristic of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is their ability for rapid production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as INF-\u03b3 and IL-17 independent of TCR engagement (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sutton et al., 2009</a>). This feature has been suggested to be hardwired in developing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells already during thymic development, probably in dependency of self-antigen recognition (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jensen et al., 2008</a>). The surface molecule CD27, which belongs to the tumor necrosis (TNF) receptor superfamily has been shown to distinguish IFN-\u03b3-producing from IL-17-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ribot et al., 2009</a>), as does the differential expression of the transcription factors T-bet and ROR\u03b3t and certain chemokine receptors such as CCR6 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Haas et al., 2009</a>)."

The prime example of tissue homing-behavior is observed in dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs), which are found in the murine epidermis and almost exclusively express a clonotypic TCR consisting of the V\u03b35 and V\u03b41 chains (<a href=\"#bib3\">Asarnow et al., 1988</a>).

Expression of Skint-1 by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barbee et al., 2011</a>) leads to a signaling cascade in developing \u03b3\u03b4 thymocytes that induces the typical gene expression profile of DETCs, concomitant to their preferential homing to the skin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Turchinovich and Hayday, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Vantourout and Hayday, 2013</a>). On the other hand, the induction of the typical gene signature of IL-17-producing V\u03b34<sup>+\u00a0</sup>\u03b3\u03b4 T cells depends on the function of the transcription factor Sox13 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gray et al., 2013</a>), while the required receptors remain elusive."

The so-called classical pathway of NF\u03baB activation is induced mainly by molecular danger signals such as LPS or certain cytokines such as TNF or IL-1\u03b2. Non-canonical NF\u03baB signaling, which requires the NF\u03baB-inducing kinase (hereafter referred to as NIK, the encoding gene being <i>Map3k14</i>,) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Malinin et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yin, 2001</a>) is activated by a discrete subset of TNF family members, including CD40L, Lymphotoxin (LT), BAFF (B cell activating factor) and RANKL (Receptor activator of NF\u03baB ligand). Signaling via the non-canonical pathway has been shown to fulfill roles in B cell survival (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sen, 2006</a>), activation of T cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Matsumoto et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ribot et al., 2009</a>), maturation and function of dendritic cells (DCs) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hofmann et al., 2011</a>) as well as the induction of tolerance (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bonneville et al., 2010</a>), but it has not been studied in the context of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell biology in detail. Previous work has suggested that signaling via the CD70-CD27 axis (which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily) can activate NF\u03baB p52 processing (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ribot et al., 2010</a>). Also, LT\u03b2R signaling has been implicated in the differentiation program of bulk \u03b3\u03b4 thymocytes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Silva-Santos, 2005</a>), and the NF\u03baB family members RelA and RelB were shown to guide the development of IL-17-producing V\u03b34<sup>+\u00a0</sup>\u03b3\u03b4 T cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Powolny-Budnicka et al., 2011</a>).

Of note, in the absence of NIK most of the IL-17 production by splenic and lung-resident \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was lost, while their ability to express IFN-\u03b3 was not affected. Mechanistically, this was accompanied by a loss of <i>Rorc</i> and <i>Sox13</i> expression in NIK-deficient CD27<sup>-\u00a0</sup>\u03b3\u03b4 T cells, while in turn expression of <i>Tbet</i> and <i>Egr3</i> was increased.

This discrepancy might result from two mutually non-exclusive explanations: first, <i>aly/aly</i> mice as well as <i>Map3k14<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice due to their complex phenotype (including impairment of thymic negative selection) are prone to develop some degree of tissue inflammation over time, which is accompanied by an expansion of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tsubata et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ishimaru et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhu et al., 2006</a>) and could thereby induce a relative decrease in the proportion of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells.

In embryogenesis, these events occur at similar time points post conception, and it seems that in the embryonic thymus, developing DETC precursors signal via the RANKL-RANK axis to immature mTECs, inducing their full maturation to Aire<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>high</sup> mTECs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>). Hence, <i>Tnfrsf11a<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice have reduced numbers of DETCs. Given that NIK is downstream of RANK (<a href=\"#bib11\">Darnay et al., 1999</a>), one would expect a similar phenotype in <i>Map3k14<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals, but the DETC deficiency that we observed in newborn <i>Map3k14<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice was much more pronounced than in <i>Tnfrsf11a<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals, suggesting that during DETC development several upstream receptors converge in their signaling to NIK, making it a key pathway during thymic DETC development. Importantly, our data obtained using the conditional NIK-mutant strongly suggests that for normal function of the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell compartment, NIK signaling does not act \u03b3\u03b4 cell-intrinsically but in trans by its function in thymic epithelial cells. Conditional deletion of NIK solely in thymic epithelial cells was sufficient to copy the DETC phenotype seen in complete germ-line NIK-knockout animals. We believe this to be the first genetic <i>in vivo</i> demonstration that non-canonical NF\u03baB signaling is not required in DETCs in a cell-intrinsic manner, but through its activity in TECs."

Only the neonatal thymic microenvironment appears to have the capacity to imprint a stable cytokine profile to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, since the IL-17-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets cannot be reconstituted in adult animals by bone marrow transfer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haas et al., 2012</a>). Very recently, a hallmark paper has provided mechanistic insights into how this can be achieved: during embryonic development of certain \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets, the signaling threshold for activation of the TCR becomes markedly altered (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wencker et al., 2013</a>). Hence, mature \u03b3\u03b4 T cells do not necessarily rely on a TCR stimulation as \u201c\u2018signal one\u201d\u2019, although they can still respond to that (<a href=\"#bib41\">Strid et al., 2011</a>)."

Previous work suggested either LT\u03b2R-dependent trans-conditioning by double positive thymocytes or \u03b3\u03b4 T cell intrinsic RelB activation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Silva-Santos, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Powolny-Budnicka et al., 2011</a>). Further work by Silva-Santos and colleagues emphasized the role of TNF-receptor family members such as CD27 as well as NF\u03baBp52 activation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ribot et al., 2010</a>). However, the contribution of thymic stromal cells to these processes has not been experimentally addressed <i>in vivo</i>. Our data suggest that NF\u03baB signaling via NIK seems to be dispensable both within CD27<sup>-\u00a0</sup>\u03b3\u03b4 T cells as well as \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, at least for their ability for expression of pro-inflammatory IL-17. Of note, deletion of NIK in all thymic epithelial cells using <i>Foxn1-Cre</i> phenocopied the complete NIK-knockout in terms of IL-17 expression by CD27<sup>-</sup>\u03b3\u03b4 T cells, while this was not the case using <i>Ccl19-Cre</i>. The latter has been reported to target only maturing medullary thymic epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Onder et al., 2015</a>). This would suggest that the instruction of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is mediated by early or junctional TECs, or that the timing of <i>Ccl19-Cre</i>-mediated recombination sharply coincides with the expression of the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell instructing program in TECs. Based on our observation that NIK signaling in the early thymic stroma has a profound and long-lasting effect on the maturation and cytokine profile of developing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, further studies are required in order to precisely define the nature of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell instructing molecules, and which thymic epithelial cell type is required for delivery. While our data does not exclude a role for canonical-NF\u03baB signaling via RelA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Powolny-Budnicka et al., 2011</a>), the impact of non-canonical signaling via NIK on the development of DETC precursors and IL-17-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells stems from signaling within the thymic stroma, for which the conditional NIK mutant is a unique tool for further studies. Future work will reveal whether NIK-deficient thymic stroma influences only \u03b3\u03b4 T cell development, or also the functional profile of the subsequently emerging \u03b1\u03b2 T cell compartment."

One likely explanation is that innate lymphocytes also contribute to the delivery of IL-17 and IL-22 to the inflamed skin and are likely to compensate for the loss of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell derived IL-17 (Pantelyushin et al., JCI, 2012)."

This is in contrast to our observations with FoxN1-Cre NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup> animals, and in all likelihood a result of the different time points of Cre expression during development in these two strains: while FoxN1-Cre targets all TECs from an early embryonic stage onwards (Gordon et al., BMC Dev Biol., 2007), CCL19-Cre is active only in maturing mTECs (Onder et al., EJI, 2015). Since the \u201cwindow\u201d for the development of IL-17-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is tightly regulated within an early stage in the embryonic thymus (Haas et al., Immunity, 2012), this would explain our observations using these two different Cre lines.
