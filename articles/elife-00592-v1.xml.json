Physiologically, native \u03b1-synuclein promotes presynaptic SNARE-complex assembly, but its molecular mechanism of action remains unknown. Here, we found that native \u03b1-synuclein promotes clustering of synaptic-vesicle mimics, using a single-vesicle optical microscopy system. This vesicle-clustering activity was observed for both recombinant and native \u03b1-synuclein purified from mouse brain. Clustering was dependent on specific interactions of native \u03b1-synuclein with both synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 and anionic lipids. Out of the three familial Parkinson's disease-related point mutants of \u03b1-synuclein, only the lipid-binding deficient mutation A30P disrupted clustering, hinting at a possible loss of function phenotype for this mutant. \u03b1-Synuclein had little effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion in our reconstituted single-vesicle system, consistent with in vivo data. \u03b1-Synuclein may therefore lead to accumulation of synaptic vesicles at the active zone, providing a \u2018buffer\u2019 of synaptic vesicles, without affecting neurotransmitter release itself."

Physiologically, native \u03b1-synuclein promotes presynaptic SNARE-complex assembly, but its molecular mechanism of action remains unknown. Here, we found that native \u03b1-synuclein promotes clustering of synaptic-vesicle mimics, using a single-vesicle optical microscopy system. This vesicle-clustering activity was observed for both recombinant and native \u03b1-synuclein purified from mouse brain. Clustering was dependent on specific interactions of native \u03b1-synuclein with both synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 and anionic lipids. Out of the three familial Parkinson's disease-related point mutants of \u03b1-synuclein, only the lipid-binding deficient mutation A30P disrupted clustering, hinting at a possible loss of function phenotype for this mutant. \u03b1-Synuclein had little effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion in our reconstituted single-vesicle system, consistent with in vivo data. \u03b1-Synuclein may therefore lead to accumulation of synaptic vesicles at the active zone, providing a \u2018buffer\u2019 of synaptic vesicles, without affecting neurotransmitter release itself."

All these messages are carried by electrical pulses that travel along chains of neurons, with neurotransmitter molecules enclosed inside synaptic vesicles conveying the messages across the synapses between neurons. A protein called \u03b1-synuclein is thought to have a role in the transport of neurotransmitter molecules across synapses, but the details of its involvement are not fully understood."

They found that native \u03b1-synuclein (and another set of membrane proteins) increases the availability of synthetic vesicles at the synapse by causing them to cluster together. In a second experiment, Diao et al. showed that native \u03b1-synuclein does not decrease calcium-triggered fusion between membranes, the process that releases neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. In contrast, it is known that pathogenic \u03b1-synuclein aggregates directly interfere with the release of the neurotransmitter molecules. Moreover, when Diao et al. used a particular mutant form of \u03b1-synuclein that is associated with Parkinson's disease, the vesicles did not form clusters. If these results are confirmed in vivo, the role played by native \u03b1-synuclein in the central nervous system, and the connection between \u03b1-synuclein and Parkinson's disease, will be much clearer."

Recombinant, erythrocyte, and brain \u03b1-Syn is predominantly monomeric in solution with a smaller fraction of multimeric species, and is largely unstructured with a small (approximately 21\u201324%) helical contribution (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fauvet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burr\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>). At high concentrations (\u223c500 \u03bcM) and in the presence of \u03b2-octylglucoside, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed weak intramolecular NOEs in regions of \u03b1-helical propensity but no tertiary interactions, reminiscent of a molten globule (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). The interaction with anionic lipids induces \u03b1-helicity in \u03b1-Syn, as revealed by CD spectroscopy (<a href=\"#bib18\">Davidson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jo et al., 2000</a>). Moreover, solution NMR studies, EPR analyses, calorimetry, and single molecule fluorescence resonance transfer experiments in the presence of SDS micelles and small unilamellar vesicles revealed that the N-terminal 100 residues form a broken amphiphatic \u03b1-helix upon binding to anionic lipids (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bussell and Eliezer, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chandra et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ulmer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ferreon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lokappa and Ulmer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Maltsev et al., 2013</a>). Binding of \u03b1-Syn to the membrane is transient, and the C-terminal 40 residues of \u03b1-Syn are unstructured and not bound to the membrane (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bodner et al., 2009</a>). N-terminal acetylation of \u03b1-Syn does not induce significant structure in recombinant \u03b1-Syn in solution (i.e., absence of detergents or lipids), but further enhances its binding to anionic membranes and induced \u03b1-helicity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Maltsev et al., 2012</a>). Although initially largely monomeric, purified brain \u03b1-Syn associates into partially folded multimers and aggregates in a time-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burr\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>). It is likely that these different monomeric and oligomeric states exist in an equilibrium in vivo, which is modulated by a variety of factors and interactions, such as membrane binding. This labile mixture of conformations provides a potential explanation for why \u03b1-Syn is so susceptible to pathological aggregation and fibril formation as observed in multiple neurodegenerative disorders (<a href=\"#bib20\">Devine et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Martin et al., 2011</a>)."

We found that native \u03b1-Syn does not significantly affect the efficiency and kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synaptic protein-mediated fusion itself. Rather, \u03b1-Syn induces clustering of vesicles with reconstituted synaptobrevin-2 or with both reconstituted synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin-1. The clustering effect is dependent on specific binding to both anionic lipid membranes and synaptobrevin-2 as revealed by deletion and mutagenesis studies, including the Parkinson's disease mutant A30P that disrupts lipid binding. Furthermore, clustering is induced by both recombinant and brain-purified native \u03b1-Syn, both of which are initially in a largely monomeric state in the absence of membranes. This clustering or lack thereof may account for the increase in SNARE-complex levels observed upon overexpression of native \u03b1-Syn (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burr\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>), and, conversely, the decrease in SNARE-complex assembly in \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-Syn triple knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burr\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>)."

Both vesicle populations were labeled with spectrally distinct fluorescent lipid analogues allowing tracking of the location of the free-floating vesicles and assessment of the surface coverage of the immobilized vesicles, respectively. Interactions between both populations of v-vesicles were measured by counting the number of initially free-floating v-vesicles that bound to the immobilized v-vesicles. We refer to this quantity as \u2018clustering\u2019 between vesicles of the same type (v-/v-vesicle clustering).

Note, that the vesicle concentration used for the cryo-EM experiment was 100-fold higher and the effective \u03b1-Syn concentration was also higher than that used for the single-vesicle clustering experiments, explaining the formation of the fairly large clusters in the cryo-EM experiment at that concentration. V-vesicles clustering does not occur in the absence of \u03b1-Syn (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>) and is therefore specific to native \u03b1-Syn. It is also entirely dependent on the presence of synaptobrevin-2, as lack of synaptobrevin-2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), or truncation of C-terminal residues of \u03b1-Syn that bind to synaptobrevin-2 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burr\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>) but do not participate in lipid binding of \u03b1-Syn (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burr\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2012</a>) significantly reduced clustering of v-vesicles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>).

We propose the following model (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>): Under normal conditions, native \u03b1-Syn would contribute to clustering of synaptic vesicles at the active zone, and thereby assist with the formation of neuronal SNARE complexes by constraining additional synaptic vesicles to be close to the active zone.

We showed previously that our particular vesicle preparation and protein reconstitution protocols (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kyoung et al., 2012</a>) produce homogeneous populations of vesicles with an average diameter of approximately 80 nm, and physiological protein concentrations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>). The resulting t-vesicle solution was diluted 10\u00d7 and immobilized on an imaging surface via biotin/neutravidin interactions under saturating conditions. Specifically, 100 \u00b5l of the diluted t-vesicle solution was injected into the sample chamber and incubated for 30 min, followed by a 200 \u03bcl vesicle buffer exchange (vesicle buffer is defined as 90 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 20 \u03bcM EGTA, 1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). V-vesicles (with reconstituted synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin-1) containing self-quenched content dye (sulforhodamine B; Invitrogen) were prepared as previously described (<a href=\"#bib21\">Diao et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kyoung et al., 2012</a>). The v-vesicle solution was diluted 150\u00d7 and added to the immobilized t-vesicle surface with 2 \u03bcM complexin-1 in presence or absence of 2 \u03bcM \u03b1-Syn. The presence of 2 \u03bcM \u03b1-Syn corresponds to a v-vesicle-lipid to \u03b1-Syn-protein ratio of 11:1, with the actual lipid to protein ratio being larger due to the presence of the saturated t-vesicle surface; at this condition, we did not observe destabilization of the v-SNARE vesicles by \u03b1-Syn since no leaking of content dyes from docked v-vesicles was observed. The system was incubated for 30 min, followed by buffer exchange (1 \u00d7 200 \u03bcl vesicle buffer for 6 s), removing unbound or weakly bound complexin and \u03b1-Syn. Then, 500 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer was injected into the sample chamber, and the fluorescence intensity of the content dye for each docked v-vesicle (but excluding few large fluorescent spots, see arrow in the lower right image of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) was monitored with total internal reflection (TIR) wide-field microscopy (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) using an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (iXon+ DV 897E; Andor Technology USA, South Windsor, CT). The smCamera program (written in C++) from Taekjip Ha's laboratory was used for data acquisition and analysis as described previously (<a href=\"#bib21\">Diao et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kyoung et al., 2012</a>).

However, we would like to point out that the effective concentration in our single vesicle clustering experiments (new Figures 3 and 4) is lower than 2\u201320 \u03bcM. The reason is that \u03b1-Syn was added after surface immobilization of acceptor DiD-labeled v-vesicles at 2\u201320 \u03bcM; after the incubation, unbound \u03b1-Syn was washed away by buffer exchange. Moreover, it is likely that the buffer exchange also removed some of the v-vesicle-bound \u03b1-Syn molecules since kinetic studies by NMR spectroscopy revealed that \u03b1-Syn binding to membranes is transient with exchanges occurring in the range of 1\u201310 s (Bodner et al., 2009). Then, donor DiI-labeled v-vesicles were injected in the absence of free \u03b1-Syn. Indeed, as Figure 4A shows, v-vesicle clustering has not reached saturation at 2 \u03bcM \u03b1-Syn incubation concentration. We added a new illustration (Figure 3B), along with a discussion of this point in the Results section."

Indeed, we already did what the reviewers suggested by removing unbound \u03b1-Syn prior to adding free v-vesicles to the surface-mmobilized v-vesicles. Furthermore, we have measured \u03b1-Syn mediated liposome clustering with liposomes that either contain synaptobrevin-2, or lack synaptobrevin-2 (Figure 4A). Only in the former case did we observe significant v-vesicle clustering, whereas in the absence of synaptobrevin-2, no clustering was observed. Thus, v-vesicle clustering is not caused by homo-oligomerization of \u03b1-Syn, but requires specific binding of \u03b1-Syn to synaptobrevin-2, as well as binding to anionic lipids."

To better explain the observed reduction of fluorescent spots in the v-/t-vesicle fusion experiments, we performed an analysis of the distribution of the fluorescence intensities of the observed fluorescent spots (new Figure 2B). The major peak (&lt;1.5 a.u.) at low florescence intensity corresponds to single donor v-vesicles docked to the imaging surface, while the high intensity tail (&gt;2 a.u.) corresponds to small clusters (doubles, triples, \u2026) of v-vesicles docked to the surface. In the presence of \u03b1-Syn, we observed a reduction of the low intensity population and a concomitant increase of higher intensity spots (Figure 2B, insert), along with a few very large spots (arrow in lower right image in Figure 2A). This observation implies the formation of v-vesicle clusters, resulting in a decrease of particle number in the finite volume of our system since the initial concentration of individual v-vesicles is identical for both experiments. A new illustration (Figure 2C) has been added to better illustrate this point. Moreover, we would like to note that extensive studies performed in our and in Pablo Castillo's laboratory failed to observe an effect of the \u03b1/\u03b2-synuclein double KO and the \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3-synuclein triple KO mice on neurotransmitter release (see Chandra et al., PNAS 2004; Burre et al., Science 2010). Our model does not necessitate a role for \u03b1-Syn in regulating release, consistent with the actual physiological results."
