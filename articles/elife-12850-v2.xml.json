Animals cannot anticipate how a given injury will alter tissue composition, so regeneration likely depends critically on the re-establishment of missing tissue identity. Planarians use pluripotent stem cells to regenerate from nearly any amputation to restore a complete set of regionalized tissues, including cephalic ganglia in the anterior and a pharynx and mouth in the trunk, and are a model of positional restoration after amputation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reddien, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Adler and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2015</a>). Canonical Wnt signaling controls anterior-versus-posterior pole identity in planarian regeneration, with principal upstream determinants <i>wnt1</i> expressed at the posterior pole (<a href=\"#bib31\">Petersen and Reddien, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gurley et al., 2010</a>) and the secreted Wnt inhibitor <i>notum</i> expressed at the anterior pole (<a href=\"#bib33\">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</a>), both activated transcriptionally early after wounding. Inhibition of Wnt signaling components \u03b2<i>-catenin-1</i>, <i>wnt1, Evi/wntless, Dvl-1/2</i> and <i>teashirt</i> causes regeneration of ectopic heads (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gurley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Iglesias et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Petersen and Reddien, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Owen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Reuter et al., 2015</a>); conversely, inhibition of <i>APC</i> or <i>notum</i> can cause regeneration of ectopic tails (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gurley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</a>). Other pathways participate in head or tail regeneration, with Hedgehog signaling influencing injury-induced <i>wnt1</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rink et al., 2009</a>), several transcription factors required for head formation (<i>prep, foxD, zic-1/zicA, pbx, egr-4)</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Felix and Aboobaker, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blassberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fraguas et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Scimone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">V\u00e1squez-Doorman and Petersen, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Vogg et al., 2014</a>) and/or tail formation (<i>junli-1, pitx, pbx</i>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blassberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Currie and Pearson, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Marz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tejada-Romero et al., 2015</a>), and influenced by gap junction and calcium signaling (<a href=\"#bib26\">Oviedo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). However, comparatively little is known about the restoration of positional information along the head-to-tail body axis through regeneration. Expression profiling and homology searching have identified a cohort of factors related to Wnt, Hox, and FGF signaling expressed regionally in domains along the anteroposterior (A-P) axis in planarians (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cebri\u00e0 et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Reddien, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Owen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Reuter et al., 2015</a>). These factors could in principle form a molecular coordinate system that re-specifies axis identity in regeneration and have been termed 'positional control genes' (PCGs) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Witchley et al., 2013</a>). However, few phenotypes of positional displacement have been reported from perturbation of PCGs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cebri\u00e0 et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kobayashi et al., 2007</a>), so it remains unclear how the majority of these genes participate in regeneration."

Ptk7 proteins encode cell-surface Wnt co-receptors with a predicted intracellular pseudokinase domain that participate in noncanonical, \u03b2-catenin-independent Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2004</a>), and can either weakly suppress or activate canonical \u03b2-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling in a context-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib29\">Peradziryi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Puppo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hayes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bin-Nun et al., 2014</a>). Like other described PCGs, planarian <i>ptk7</i> was expressed in <i>collagen+</i> cells of the body-wall musculature (<a href=\"#bib48\">Witchley et al., 2013</a>) and aspects of its expression domain could become re-established after amputation even in irradiated animals lacking neoblasts and the ability to form new tissues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). In <i>ptk7(RNAi)</i> animals amputated to remove both head and tail, regeneration produced a normal head and tail (35/35) but caused formation of an ectopic posterior mouth at a high penetrance (83%, n=35) and, more rarely, formation of an ectopic posterior pharynx with broadly normal orientation with respect to the primary body axis (14%, n=35) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>).

Such <i>ptk7(RNAi);wntP-2(RNAi)</i> or <i>ptk7(RNAi);ndl-3(RNAi)</i> regenerating animals had normal anterior pole and brain regions (marked by <i>notum, ndk</i>) and a normal pre-pharyngeal region anterior to the original pharynx (marked by <i>wnt2</i> and novel gene <i>SMU15014980</i>), expansion of trunk-related peripharyngeal cells (expressing <i>mmp1, FoxA</i>, and SMU15007112), a reduced domain of PCGs expressed in the posterior (<i>wnt11-1, fzd-4-1</i> and <i>Abd-Ba</i>), and normal expression of <i>wnt1</i> at the posterior pole.

Visual inspection of colorimetric in situ hybridizations suggested that <i>ndl-3, ptk7,</i> and <i>wntP-</i>2 are expressed in overlapping domains along the anteroposterior axis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We verified this interpretation by quantifying the staining intensity of colorimetric in situ hybridizations along a lateral region running from head to tail (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). <i>ndl-3</i> staining intensity was maximal in the anterior in a region of graded <i>ptk7</i> staining. <i>ptk7</i> staining was maximal in the trunk region in which <i>wntP-2</i> and <i>ndl-3</i> staining form opposing gradients. <i>wntP-2</i> staining was maximal in the posterior tail in a region of relatively less <i>ptk7</i> expression. The graded expression detected in this manner could arise from regional differences in the abundance of cells that uniquely express each factor or in regulation of cells that express combinations of the three genes. To test these models, we performed triple FISH to simultaneously detect expression of all three genes in eight domains along the head-tail axis, which broadly confirmed the regionalized expression behavior of anterior/pre-pharyngeal maximal <i>ndl-3</i> expression, trunk maximal <i>ptk7</i> expression, and tail maximal <i>wntP-2</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We sought to verify this trend quantitatively and segmented the images to examine cells expressing any of the three genes (see Materials and Methods) then determined the mean FISH intensity for each gene per cell. This demonstrated that regions of maximal expression of <i>ndl-3, ptk7,</i> and <i>wntP-2</i> are comprised of cells with high expression of these genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We next examined pairwise comparisons of expression of each gene across the body axis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This approach identified cells that co-express <i>wntP-2</i> and <i>ndl-3</i> (in particular in head-to trunk proximal regions R3-R5, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), <i>ptk7</i> and <i>ndl-3</i> (head-to-trunk regions R2-R4), and <i>ptk7</i> and <i>wntP-2</i> (trunk-to-tail regions R5-R7). We explored whether this approach could identify the spatial distribution of discrete states of cells expressing all combinations of the three genes. We pooled the cell-based expression data across all regions to determine an approximate threshold to define higher versus lower expression for each gene, then assigned each measured cell into one of eight expression classes representing each combination of high versus low expression of each <i>ptk7, wntP-2</i>, and <i>ndl-3</i> and determined their distribution across the head-tail axis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement1A\u2013C</a>). This approach identified domains enriched for each expression state, finding a cohort with high <i>wntP-2</i> expression and low <i>ptk7</i> and <i>ndl-3</i> expression in the far posterior, a cohort co-expressing <i>ptk7</i> and <i>wntP-2</i> in the anterior tail and trunk regions, a cohort only expressing <i>ptk7</i> and not <i>wntP-2</i> or <i>ndl-3</i> centered in the trunk, cohorts of triple-positive cells and <i>ptk7+ndl-</i>3+ cells in the pre-pharyngeal region, and cohort of <i>ndl-3+</i> cells in the anterior. These results suggest that a complexity of PCG cell expression states populate regions of the body axis and that a region of high <i>wntP-2</i> and <i>ptk7</i> expression exists in the anterior tail at a location where these two genes act together to suppress trunk identity."

The results of our <i>ptk7</i> RNAi enhancement screen suggested a candidate molecular pathway in which <i>wntP-2</i> signals through <i>ptk7</i> and <i>fzd1/2/7</i> to suppress trunk identity. We verified that RNAi of <i>fzd1/2/7</i> alone resulted in ectopic mouth and pharynx formation similar to <i>ptk7</i> and/or <i>wntP-2</i> inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Similarly, we verified that <i>Dvl-2</i> but not <i>Dvl-1</i> could interact with <i>ptk7</i> genetically, suggesting the involvement of <i>Dvl-2</i> in trunk suppression (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Ptk7 proteins can act in planar cell polarization so we tested for possible functional interactions between <i>ptk7</i> and components of the Planar Cell Polarity pathway <i>vangl1, vangl2, DAAM1</i> and <i>ROCK</i> but inhibition of these genes did not increase or decrease the occurrence of ectopic mouth or pharynx phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We additionally tested whether a downstream step in trunk suppression could be promotion or inhibition of beta-catenin activity. However, co-inhibition of <i>ptk7</i> and <i>wntP-2</i> or <i>ptk7</i> and <i>ndl-3</i> had no detectable effect on expression of beta-catenin-dependent transcripts <i>axin-B</i> and <i>teashirt</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Owen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Reuter et al., 2015</a>). <i>\u03b2-catenin-1(RNAi)</i> animals lose trunk regional identity and their pharynx while becoming completely anteriorized (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iglesias et al., 2008</a>), so we tested for possible functional interactions between beta-catenin signaling and trunk control genes by inhibiting <i>ptk7/wntP-2</i> along with <i>APC</i>. We could not detect any enhancement or suppression of ectopic pharynx formation in that assay, further suggesting independence between <i>ptk7/wntP-2</i> and <i>APC/\u03b2-catenin-1</i> signaling (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). These observations are consistent with the clear distinction between the <i>\u03b2-catenin-1</i> RNAi phenotype of ectopic head production (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gurley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Iglesias et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</a>) as compared to the <i>ptk7(RNAi);wntP-2(RNAi)</i> and <i>ptk7(RNAi);ndl-3(</i>RNAi) phenotypes of ectopic trunk formation without affecting the identity of the anterior and posterior poles. Together, these results strongly suggest that trunk regionalization can be separable from pole identity and that <i>ptk7</i> and <i>wntP-2</i> likely do not operate exclusively through <i>\u03b2-catenin-1</i> to pattern the trunk and tail."

We tested for possible mutual expression requirements in tail fragments, reasoning this might provide a sensitized context in which the expression domains normally undergo regulation. <i>wntP-2</i> expression was reduced in <i>ndl-3(RNAi)</i> tail fragments, particularly along the lateral edges (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), and posteriorly restricted in <i>ptk7(RNAi)</i> regenerating tail fragments (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>), suggesting that these genes can normally promote expression of <i>wntP-2</i> in regenerating tail fragments.

In the tail region of uninjured animals and regenerating trunk fragments, high levels of <i>wntP-2/ptk7</i> activity prevent the acquisition of trunk identity and enable the formation of anterior tail tissue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). By contrast, head fragments initially have lower expression of <i>wntP-2</i> and <i>ptk7</i>, which could facilitate their formation of trunk tissue through regeneration. Amputated tail fragments would be expected to initially possess high levels of <i>wntP-2</i> and <i>ptk7</i> activity, but a regeneration expression regulatory program reduces <i>wntP-2</i> mRNA from the anterior to allow trunk regionalization to occur at an appropriate location. These models suggest that the expression status of <i>wntP-2</i> and <i>ptk7</i> could provide information about the presence or absence of pre-existing tissues used in determining regeneration outcomes. A previously proposed animal-wide gradient of <i>\u03b2-catenin-1</i> activity (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reuter et al., 2015</a>) could set up the axis into distinct <i>ptk7, wntP-2</i> and <i>ndl-3</i> expression domains refined by <i>wntP-2</i> and <i>ptk7</i> repression of <i>ndl-3</i> expression. However, our experiments argue that a <i>\u03b2-catenin-1</i>-independent signaling output downstream of <i>wntP-2</i> and <i>ptk7</i> likely act to suppress trunk regional identity and thereby control placement of a trunk/tail boundary along the axis according to a gradation of their activities within the posterior. The identification of trunk expansion phenotypes independent of head/tail identity transformations suggests that whole-body regeneration involves a regulatory hierarchy of anterior/posterior pole formation followed by subsequent regional subdivision."

However, studies in <i>Drosophila</i>, zebrafish, <i>Xenopus</i> and mammalian tissue culture have found conflicting evidence that Ptk7 can also either promote (<a href=\"#bib34\">Puppo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bin-Nun et al., 2014</a>) or inhibit (<a href=\"#bib29\">Peradziryi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hayes et al., 2013</a>) beta-catenin-dependent signaling in a context-dependent manner. The regional identity defects we observe after <i>ptk7</i> RNAi in planarians are not obviously the result of defective planar cell orientations, are phenocopied by inhibition of a Wnt gene, and do not globally affect beta-catenin transcriptional targets or beta-catenin-dependent processes. We suggest that Ptk7 proteins can control tissue fate through an alternate mechanism, perhaps by coordinating the activities of cell cohorts within a field. Planarians and most other animals have expression of multiple Wnts in posterior domains, pointing to their ancient use in organizing the primary body axis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Petersen and Reddien, 2009</a>). The use of Ptk7 proteins for trunk/tail regionalization could therefore have an ancient origin and allow posterior Wnts to produce distinct signaling outcomes for combinatorial pattern control."

Intriguingly, in both cases, the FGFRL genes have most prominent expression in the anterior but act with the same sign as the Wnt genes to promote more posterior identity outside of the domain of their own expression. In mammals, FGFRL1 and Wnt4 are each required for formation of the metanephric kidney from intermediate mesoderm, suggesting this positive regulatory relationship is conserved (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stark et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gerber et al., 2009</a>)."

In planarians, asymmetric wound-induced expression of <i>notum</i> provides information about wound site directionality used to program anterior-versus-posterior pole fates (<a href=\"#bib33\">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</a>). By contrast, we find genes encoding signaling molecules that are constitutively expressed in body-wide mRNA gradients and are used for control of positional information in regeneration. Graded expression of paracrine factors across fields of cells could enable patterning over the large length-scales necessary for adult regeneration. The interactions between this tissue-wide positional information present at the time of injury, combined with wound-induced directional cues, could account for robust pattern control in regeneration."

It has been a long-standing question as to how signaling pathways can act over long distances such as those across several millimeters of the planarian anterior-posterior axis. The work here begins to answer this question by identifying patterning molecules for large body domains. The authors further show that a previously known WNT molecule and an FGFRL molecule also play a role to pattern large domains around the central <i>ptk7</i> region. When knocked down by RNAi, these molecules and other potential positional controlling genes (PCGs) together with Ptk7 identified 4 genes (<i>WntP2, ndl-3, Dvl-2</i> and <i>fzd-1/2/7</i>) that potentiate the phenotype which appear to form a co-regulatory circuit that particularly affects the positioning of the pharynx and mouth. The authors nicely show that Ptk7 together with <i>ndl-3</i> or <i>WntP-2</i> are not required for extreme anterior or posterior pole identity, and that these genes function independently of \u03b2-catenin signaling. Finally, the authors show that pharynx positioning is dependent on this system during tail regeneration."

We also performed additional histological analysis of <i>ptk7(RNAi);wntP-2(RNAi)</i> animals and also <i>ptk7(RNAi);ndl3(RNAi)</i> animals. Such animals have a similar frequency of forming ectopic pharynges (80% vs 90% of animals, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), a similar distribution of ectopic pharynx orientations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and a similar expression of axial markers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) that show enlargement of trunk (<i>mmp1, FoxA</i>, SMU15007112) and reduction of anterior tail (<i>wnt11-1, fzd4-1, Abd-Ba</i>). These genes may act in other distinct processes in the animals or influence trunk/tail regionalization in subtly distinct ways, but based on these analyses we could not find any consistent differences in the <i>ptk7(RNAi);wntP-2(RNAi) versus ptk7(RNAi);ndl3(RNAi)</i> phenotypes. We re-examined our scoring for formation of 1- versus 2- ectopic pharynges in these two treatments and found variability in this ratio across experiments, which we believe to be due to differences in feeding status and size of the animals. When we analyzed data from 8 experiments, we indeed found that <i>wntP- 2(RNAi);ptk7(RNAi)</i> animals formed 2-ectopic pharynges at a higher frequency than <i>ndl-3(RNAi);ptk7(RNAi)</i> animals (25% versus 6% of the time). However, such animals presenting two ectopic pharynges did not appear different and the low frequency of such events in <i>ndl-3(RNAi);ptk7(RNAi)</i> prevented a detailed histological comparison of these groups.

We did not detect any clear difference to the size or expression status of the brain by these criteria. We further examined the possible involvement of <i>FoxA</i>+ cells in the ectopic pharynx phenotype and could detect the expansion of the <i>FoxA</i>+ expression domain in fully regenerated <i>ptk7(RNAi);wntP-2(RNAi)</i> and also <i>ptk7(RNAi);ndl3(RNAi)</i> trunk fragments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We were able to detect a region of ectopic <i>FoxA+</i> expression at an early time in the appearance of the ectopic pharynx, consistent with a mechanism in which trunk duplication occurs via the production or relocalization of <i>FoxA+</i> precursor cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

Given that Ptk7 proteins can act as Wnt-coreceptors, and given the rarity of ectopic trunk phenotypes (not observed in previously published large-scale RNAi screens such as Reddien et al. 2005), this suggests a molecular pathway of action in which <i>WntP-2</i> signals through Ptk7 to inhibit trunk fates. We support this conclusion by finding similar phenotypes from inhibition of a frizzled receptor, <i>fzd1/2/7</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These observations argue against a likely participation of Wnt-independent Ptk7 signaling (such as via semaphoring/plexin signaling or VEGF signaling) in trunk suppression. We tested several components of the Planar Cell Polarity pathway (<i>vangl-1, vangl-2</i>, <i>DAAM1,</i> and <i>ROCK</i>) because of its connection with noncanonical Wnt signalling pathways and could not find genetic interactions with <i>ptk7</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We also measured the orientation of the ectopic pharynx in all of our RNAi treatments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and found that the majority of such structures are indeed oriented obliquely. In some cases the pharynx was oriented toward the anterior, but the majority of ectopic pharynges in all conditions pointed toward the posterior (the arc from -90 to 0 to 90 degrees) rather than toward the anterior (the arc 90 to 180/-180 to -90 degrees), and the distributions of angles did not appear fully randomized (as compared to equal numbers of randomly selected angles plotted as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, not shown). It is possible that a cell polarization pathway is involved in the regional identity determination controlled by these genes (and we now discuss this possibility in the Discussion paragraph two), but our data does not find evidence it is the PCP pathway. Alternatively, from the appearance of many of the ectopic pharynx phenotypes it seems that the structure grows in a confined manner that can result in the attainment of a particular angular orientation. Of note, animals with two ectopic pharynges always formed them oriented toward the posterior midline. We also note that the posterior and anterior pole identities in animals with ectopic pharynges were normal, suggesting that trunk suppression (and orientation of any ectopic pharynx) and body axis polarization are under distinct control mechanisms."

We also quantified expression of all three genes on a per-cell basis using triple FISH (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This broadly confirmed the domains of gene expression. We analyzed this data in two ways to support the existence of expression cell states of the three genes that populate the body axis. First, scatterplots of expression of pairwise combinations of the three genes show the existence of co-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Second, we determined approximate distributions of particular expression states by applying thresholds for low- versus high-expression to bin each cells into one of 8 possible expression classes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and found that these populate the axis in distinct domains.
