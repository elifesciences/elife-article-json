Somatosensory neurons are functionally and anatomically diverse but their molecular profiles are not well-defined. Here, we used transcriptional profiling to analyze the detailed molecular signatures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. We used two mouse reporter lines and surface IB4 labeling to purify three major non-overlapping classes of neurons: 1) IB4<sup>+</sup>SNS-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup>, 2) IB4<sup>\u2212</sup>SNS-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup>, and 3) Parv-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells, encompassing the majority of nociceptive, pruriceptive, and proprioceptive neurons. These neurons displayed distinct expression patterns of ion channels, transcription factors, and GPCRs. Highly parallel qRT-PCR analysis of 334 single neurons selected by membership of the three populations demonstrated further diversity, with unbiased clustering analysis identifying six distinct subgroups. These data significantly increase our knowledge of the molecular identities of known DRG populations and uncover potentially novel subsets, revealing the complexity and diversity of those neurons underlying somatosensation."

Somatosensory neurons are functionally and anatomically diverse but their molecular profiles are not well-defined. Here, we used transcriptional profiling to analyze the detailed molecular signatures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. We used two mouse reporter lines and surface IB4 labeling to purify three major non-overlapping classes of neurons: 1) IB4<sup>+</sup>SNS-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup>, 2) IB4<sup>\u2212</sup>SNS-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup>, and 3) Parv-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells, encompassing the majority of nociceptive, pruriceptive, and proprioceptive neurons. These neurons displayed distinct expression patterns of ion channels, transcription factors, and GPCRs. Highly parallel qRT-PCR analysis of 334 single neurons selected by membership of the three populations demonstrated further diversity, with unbiased clustering analysis identifying six distinct subgroups. These data significantly increase our knowledge of the molecular identities of known DRG populations and uncover potentially novel subsets, revealing the complexity and diversity of those neurons underlying somatosensation."

These fibers carry sensory information to the spinal cord, where it can be relayed to the brain and processed. The experiments compared three distinct types of DRG neuron and found that they differed in their ability to send information to other cells."

Next, large numbers of single cells were analyzed to find out the finer details about the three types of neuron. These findings made it possible to further divide the DRG neurons into six distinct subsets that matched previously known groups of somatosensory neurons, and also identified new ones."

                        "text": "The somatosensory nervous system comprises diverse neuronal subsets with distinct conduction properties and peripheral and central innervation patterns, including small-diameter, unmyelinated C-fibers, thinly myelinated A\u03b4-fibers, and large-diameter, thickly myelinated A\u03b1/\u03b2-fibers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Basbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</a>). Distinct sets of somatosensory neurons are thought to mediate different functional modalities, such as tactile sensation, proprioception, pruriception and nociception. During development, precise expression of neurotrophic receptors and transcription factors at different times controls the differentiation and connectivity of these diverse sensory afferent populations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marmigere and Ernfors, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</a>). Detection of thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli in the external or internal environment by the somatosensory neurons is mediated by expression of specific molecular transducers at their peripheral nerve terminals. For example, transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are activated in response to heat, cold, reactive chemicals, leading to cation influx and action potential generation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Basbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dib-Hajj et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Julius, 2013</a>). Given the high degree of cellular diversity of the somatosensory system defined at developmental, anatomical, and functional levels, a classification scheme of different somatosensory neuron subtypes based on the comprehensive set of genes they express is so far lacking. Determining the detailed molecular organization of specific somatosensory neuron subtypes is however necessary for our understanding of their specification, normal function and contribution to disease."

Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and other neuron purification strategies coupled with transcriptional profiling by microarray analysis or RNA sequencing has allowed detailed molecular characterization of discrete populations of mouse forebrain neurons (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sugino et al., 2006</a>), striatal projection neurons (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lobo et al., 2006</a>), serotonergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wylie et al., 2010</a>), corticospinal motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arlotta et al., 2005</a>), callosal projection neurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Molyneaux et al., 2009</a>), proprioceptor lineage neurons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lee et al., 2012</a>), and electrophysiologically distinct neocortical populations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Okaty et al., 2009</a>). These data have uncovered novel molecular insights into neuronal function. Transcriptional profiling technology at the single cell level is transforming our understanding of the organization of tumor cell populations and cellular responses in the immune system (<a href=\"#bib41\">Patel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Shalek et al., 2014</a>), and has begun to be applied to neuronal populations (<a href=\"#bib12\">Citri et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mizeracka et al., 2013</a>).

Using two reporter mice, SNS-Cre/TdTomato and Parv-Cre/TdTomato, together with surface Isolectin B4-FITC staining, we identify three major, non-overlapping populations of DRG neurons encompassing almost all C-fibers and many A-fibers. SNS-Cre is a BAC transgenic mouse line expressing Cre under the Scn10a (Nav1.8) promoter (<a href=\"#bib4\">Agarwal et al., 2004</a>) which has been shown to encompass DRG and trigeminal ganglia nociceptor lineage neurons, and in conditional gene ablation studies affects thermosensation, itch, and pain (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lopes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lou et al., 2013</a>). A widely used Nav1.8-Cre knock-in mouse line also exists (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stirling et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Abrahamsen et al., 2008</a>), but differs to some extent from the transgenic SNS-Cre mouse line. We find, for example, that SNS-Cre/TdTomato reporter mice label 82% of total DRG neurons, which is slightly greater than Nav1.8-Cre/TdTomato reporter mice (75%) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shields et al., 2012</a>), implying capture of a larger neuronal population. Both the SNS-Cre lineage and Nav1.8-Cre lineage neurons include a large proportion of C-fibers and a smaller population of NF200<sup>+</sup> A-fibers (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shields et al., 2012</a>). As expected, the majority of TdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells (90%) in the SNS-Cre/TdTomato line expressed Scn10a transcript encoding Nav1.8 when tested by RNA in situ <i>hybridization</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). Our second reporter line used Parv-Cre, a knock-in strain expressing Ires-Cre under the control of the Parvalbumin promoter, which has been used in the study of proprioceptive-lineage (large NF200<sup>+</sup> A-fiber) neuron function (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Niu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">de Nooij et al., 2013</a>).

Differential expression analysis defined transcriptional hallmarks in each for ion channels, transcription factors and G-protein coupled receptors. Further analysis of hundreds of single DRG neurons identifies distinct somatosensory subsets within the originally purified populations, which were confirmed by RNA in situ hybridization. Our analysis illustrates the enormous heterogeneity and complexity of neurons that mediate peripheral somatosensation, as well as revealing the molecular basis for their functional specialization."

IB4 labeled a DRG subset that was completely included within the SNS-Cre/TdTomato population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, 98 \u00b1 0.87% IB4<sup>+</sup> were SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, 28.0 \u00b1 1.8% SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons were IB4<sup>+</sup>). By contrast, IB4 staining was effectively absent in the Parv-Cre/TdTomato population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, 1.18 \u00b1 1.35% IB4<sup>+</sup> were Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup>). CGRP also fell completely within a subset of the SNS-Cre/TdTomato population and also was absent in the Parv-Cre/TdTomato population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, 99.4 \u00b1 0.4% CGRP<sup>+</sup> were SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup>; 1.5 \u00b1 2.05% CGRP<sup>+</sup> were Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, 45.1 \u00b1 3.9% SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> were CGRP<sup>+</sup>). Neurofilament heavy chain 200 kDa (NF200) was expressed by the majority of the Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, 96.1 \u00b1 1.9%), but only a small proportion of the SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> population (16.9 \u00b1 1.9%). Parvalbumin protein was expressed by the majority of Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, 81.4 \u00b1 3.4%), but was absent in the SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, 0.8 \u00b1 0.2%). In the spinal cord, SNS-Cre/TdTomato fibers mostly overlapped with CGRP and IB4 central terminal staining in superficial dorsal horn layers (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, Parv-Cre/TdTomato fibers extended into deeper dorsal horn laminae, Clark's Nucleus, and the ventral horn (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, these observations suggest that these two lineage reporter lines labeled two distinct populations of primary sensory afferents and the SNS-Cre/TdTomato population includes several subsets that can be partly delineated by IB4 staining (Venn diagram, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). By NeuN staining, SNS-Cre/TdTomato labeled 82 \u00b1 3.0% of all DRG neurons, while Parv-Cre/TdTomato labeled 12.5 \u00b1 1.7% DRG neurons, indicating that the majority of primary afferents are included within these two populations.

To avoid multiple rounds of amplification of small quantities of RNA, which would arise from less-abundant neuronal populations such as Parv-cre/TdT<sup>+</sup>, we chose to pool DRGs from cervical to lumbar regions (C1-L6). DRG cells were enzymatically dissociated and subjected to flow cytometry following DAPI staining to exclude dead cells, and gating on TdTomato<sup>hi</sup> populations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This allowed for purification of TdTomato<sup>+</sup> neuronal somata with minimal contamination from fluorescent axonal debris and non-neuronal cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Analysis of our flow cytometry data showed SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> vs Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> DRG cells matched the proportions ascertained by NeuN co-staining in DRG sections (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). It also illustrates that a large percentage of DAPI<sup>\u2212</sup> live cells are non-neuronal. IB4-FITC surface staining allowed us to simultaneously purify the distinct IB4<sup>+</sup> and IB4<sup>\u2212</sup> subsets within the SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> population (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Forward and side scatter light scattering properties reflect cell size and internal complexity, respectively. SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons displayed significantly less forward scatter and side scatter than Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For RNA extraction, DRG populations were sorted directly into Qiazol to preserve transcriptional profiles at the time of isolation."

Piezo2 (Fam38b), a mechanosensory ion channel (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coste et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Maksimovic et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Woo et al., 2014</a>), was highly expressed in all somatosensory subsets (&gt;4000 normalized expression), with enrichment in SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> relative to Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons. By contrast, Trpc1, a channel linked to cutaneous mechanosensation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Garrison et al., 2012</a>) was enriched in Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons, indicating a potential role in proprioception. C-tactile afferent markers Slc17a8 (Vglut3) and Th (Tyrosine hydroxylase) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Seal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2011</a>) were enriched in IB4<sup>\u2212</sup>SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons, while Mrgprb4 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Vrontou et al., 2013</a>) was enriched in IB4<sup>+</sup>SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons. Mrgprd and Runx1 were enriched in IB4<sup>+</sup>SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons, which are known markers of non-peptidergic nociceptors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang and Zylka, 2009</a>). Expression of neutrophic factor receptors (Ntrk1, Ntrk2, Ntrk3, Gfra2, Gfra3, Ret) also showed distinct segregation patterns among the IB4<sup>+</sup>SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup>, IB4<sup>\u2212</sup>SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> and Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> populations. Pvalb, Cadherin 12 (Cdh12), Vglut1 (Slc17a7), and transcription factors (Runx3, Etv1, Etv4) were highly enriched in Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons relative to the other two subsets. The distribution of these known mediators or markers of somatosensory function reveals differences and similarities between the three populations that reflect their functional specialization and modality responsiveness."

                                "text": "We next focused our analysis on the expression patterns of those families of genes that mediate different general neuronal functions. Neurons exhibit specific firing properties due to the coordinated activity of different voltage-gated ion channels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bean, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dib-Hajj et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010</a>). We found that many voltage-gated sodium, calcium, potassium, and chloride channels were differentially expressed in the three purified DRG populations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). Focusing on sodium channels, Scn9a (Nav1.7), Scn10a (Nav1.8), and Scn11a (Nav1.9) were enriched both in the IB4<sup>+</sup> and IB4<sup>\u2212</sup>SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> populations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), agreeing with known roles in nociception (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dib-Hajj et al., 2010</a>). Scn1a (Nav1.1), Scn8a (Nav1.6), and sodium channel beta subunits Scn1b, Scn4b were mainly expressed in Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Voltage-gated calcium channels, including L-type, N-type, and T-type channels, also showed differential expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons were highly enriched for Cacna2d1 (\u03b12\u03b41) and for Cacna2d2 (\u03b12\u03b42), the pharmacological targets of gabapentin and pregabalin (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Field et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Patel et al., 2013</a>); unexpectedly, Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons were enriched for Cacna2d3 (\u03b12\u03b43) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), which contributes to heat nociception via supraspinal expression (<a href=\"#bib37\">Neely et al., 2010</a>). Voltage-gated potassium channels showed perhaps the most striking expression patterns across somatosensory subsets (Top 60 most variably expressed shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Kcns1 (Kv9.1), where a common variant is associated with increased pain and whose down-regulation in large sensory neurons is associated with increased neuropathic pain (<a href=\"#bib14\">Costigan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tsantoulas et al., 2012</a>), was expressed in Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The IB4<sup>+</sup>SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup>, IB4<sup>\u2212</sup>SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup>, and Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> populations each showed distinct enrichment patterns for potassium channel genes, most of which have not yet been analyzed yet in terms of somatosensory function. Voltage-gated chloride channels also showed distinct expression patterns, with differential regulation of Clcn and Tweety family ion channel transcripts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Surprisingly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated chloride channel Ano1 (Anoctamin 1), which has recently been linked to heat nociception (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cho et al., 2012</a>), was absent in SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> populations but present in Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

Ligand-gated ion channels also play key roles in nociception or other somatosensory functions.

This analysis revealed a high degree of heterogeneity of transcriptional expression across the three DRG populations. The vast majority of single cells showed distinct patterns of expression of at least one neuronal transcript, including voltage-gated ion channels (Scn10a, Scn11a, Kcnc2, Kcnv1), ligand-gated channels (P2rx3, Trpv1, Trpa1), and Parvalbumin (Pvalb) indicating minimal amplification noise (<a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Unbiased spearman rank analysis revealed seven distinct neuronal subgroups (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). Six out of seven groups had 24 or more individual cells (group I, 115 cells; group II, 50 cells; group III, 4 cells; group IV, 24 cells; group V, 24 cells; group VI, 24 cells; group VII, 93 cells). We chose one level of sample segregation to analyze, but other cellular subclasses are likely present at lower levels of clustering (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). Importantly, when hierarchical clustering was performed on data normalized to Actb, neuronal subgroups based on gapdh normalization segregated in a similar manner (data not shown). Principal components analysis showed distinct separation of the single cell subgroups along different principal components (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A</a>), with Groups I and VII on disparate arms of PC2 (\u223c5% variation), while Group V neurons segregated along PC3 (\u223c1.88% variation).

By contrast, the group VII marker Gpcr5b did not stain SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons but co-localized well with Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> proprioceptors (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>). Double ISH found that itch-related Group VI marker IL31ra did not colocalize with group I markers Prkcq or Lpar3, nor with group VII marker Gpcr5b (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>). In confirmation of the Fluidigm data, double ISH found that IL31ra colocalized well with Nppb (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>), thus confirming co-expression of two itch-related markers in the same neuronal subset. Thus, expression profiling at single cell resolution reveals an unsuspected degree of complexity of sensory neurons with elucidation of many new markers and of different neuronal subtypes."

The somatosensory system, all of whose primary sensory neurons are of neural crest origin, is highly complex, innervating diverse peripheral tissues and encoding thermal, mechanical, and chemical modalities across a broad range of sensitivities, from innocuous to noxious with different dynamic ranges (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marmigere and Ernfors, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Basbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2011</a>). Sensory neurons are currently classified based on myelination and conduction properties (i.e., C-, A\u03b1/\u03b2- or A\u03b4-fibers) or their selective expression of ion channels (e.g., Trpv1, P2rx3, Nav1.8), neurotrophin receptors (e.g., TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, Ret), cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., NF200, Peripherin), and GPCRs (e.g., Mrgprd, Mrgpra3). However, combining these different classification criteria can result in complex degrees of overlaps, making a cohesive categorization of distinct somatosensory populations challenging. Transcriptome-based analysis has become recently a powerful tool to understand the organization of complex populations, including subpopulations of CNS and PNS neurons (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lobo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sugino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Molyneaux et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Okaty et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mizeracka et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>).

There were vast transcriptional differences between SNS-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup> and Parv-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons, potentially reflecting their developmental specification into neurons with quite different functional attributes and targets. As SNS-Cre is expressed mainly within TrkA-lineage neurons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdel Samad et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2010</a>), while Parv-Cre is expressed mainly in proprioceptor-lineage neurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</a>), these two populations reflect archetypical C- and A\u03b1/\u03b2-fibers, respectively. Bourane et al previously performed SAGE analysis of TrkA deficient compared to wild-type DRGs, which revealed 240 differentially expressed genes and enriching for nociceptor hallmarks (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bourane et al., 2007</a>). Our FACS sorting and comparative population analysis identified 1681 differentially expressed transcripts (twofold), many of which may reflect the early developmental divergence and vast functional differences between these lineages. While C-fibers mediate thermosensation, pruriception and nociception from skin and deeper tissues, Parv-Cre lineage neurons mediate proprioception, innervating muscle spindles and joints (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marmigere and Ernfors, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010</a>). Almost exclusive TRP channel expression in SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons vs Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neurons may relate to their specific thermosensory and chemosensory roles. We also found significant molecular differences between the IB4<sup>+</sup> and IB4<sup>\u2212</sup> subsets of SNS-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> neuronal populations. Our analysis identified many molecular hallmarks for the IB4<sup>+</sup>subset (e.g., Agtr1a, Casz1, Slc16a12, Moxd1) that are as enriched as the currently used markers (P2rx3, Mrgprd), but whose expression and functional roles in these neurons have not yet been characterized. This analysis of somatosensory subsets covered the majority of DRG neurons (\u223c95%), with the exception of TrkB<sup>+</sup> A\u03b4 cutaneous low-threshold fibers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2011</a>), which are NF200<sup>+</sup> but we find are negative for SNS-Cre/TdTomato and Parv-Cre/TdTomato (Data not shown)."

Interestingly, we found a log-scale continuum for many transcripts, including nociceptive genes (e.g., Trpv1, Trpa1) showing high expression in IB4<sup>+</sup> and IB4<sup>\u2212</sup> subsets and with lower but not absent levels in Parv-Cre/TdT<sup>+</sup> cells. This may reflect transcriptional shut-down of genes during differentiation. Unbiased hierarchical clustering analysis of single cell data revealed at least six distinct neuronal subgroups. These findings reveal new molecular characteristics for known neuron populations and also uncover novel neuron subsets: Group I neurons consist of Mrgprd<sup>+</sup>Nav1.8<sup>+</sup>P2rx3<sup>+</sup>Nav1.9<sup>+</sup> cells, which are polymodal non-peptidergic C-fibers, for which we identify a panoply of new molecular markers. Group II consists of Trka<sup>hi</sup>Nav1.8<sup>+</sup>Trpv1<sup>+</sup>Aquaporin<sup>+</sup> neurons, matching known characteristics of thermosensitive C-fibers; many of these expressed Kcnv1. Group V consists of Th<sup>+</sup>Nav1.8<sup>+</sup>Trka<sup>\u2212</sup>Trpv1<sup>\u2212</sup> cells, matching characteristics of C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2011</a>).

Lee et al recently performed transcriptome analysis of purified TrkC-lineage proprioceptive neurons in the presence or absence of NT-3 signaling (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lee et al., 2012</a>) and we note that Group VII neurons were similar to TrkC lineage cells in gene expression (Pth1r, Runx3, Pvalb). Group IV consists of Trpv1<sup>+</sup>Nav1.8<sup>\u2212</sup> neurons, which may represent a unique functional subgroup; Wood et al found that mice depleted for Nav1.8-lineage neurons retained a TRPV1 responsive subset (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrahamsen et al., 2008</a>).

We note that each study utilized distinct methodologies from our work: Goswami et al profiled Trpv1-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons compared to Trpv1-diptheria toxin depleted whole DRG tissue (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goswami et al., 2014</a>). Thakur et al performed magnetic bead selection to remove DRG non-neuronal cells, performing RNA-seq on residual cells enriched for neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thakur et al., 2014</a>). Usoskin et al performed an elegant single cell RNA-seq on hundreds of DRG neurons that were picked in an unbiased fashion robotically (<a href=\"#bib53\">Usoskin et al., 2014</a>). We believe that our study possesses has unique features and certain advantages, as well as limitations, in relation to these studies. In our study, we performed whole population analysis of three major DRG subsets, which we followed by single cell granular profiling of hundreds of cells from the same populations. We believe advantages of beginning with a differential analysis of well-defined populations is that this facilitates correlation of the data back to function and enables a highly specific comparative analysis to be performed between major neuronal populations. Further definition of each population by shifting to a single cell strategy then allows identification of functionally defined groups of cells. The same advantages of a population based strategy is also a caveat, in that it could introduce pre-determined bias, which Usoskin et al purposely avoided by randomly picking single DRG neurons as a starting point. We note that our analysis is the only one so far to utilize parallel qRT-PCR of single cells, which we demonstrate is able to detect log-scale differences in expression (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>), and may have better detection sensitivities than single cell RNA-seq. In a comparison of the overall datasets, we produce some similar findings with Usoskin et al, including the finding of a distinct pruriceptive population (IL31ra<sup>+</sup> Group VI). However, our analysis showed higher definition of markers present in Group I and Group VII neurons, as well as Group IV neurons (which was not previously described), while Usoskin et al detected TrkB<sup>+</sup> neurons whereas we did not, as these cells are not included in our sorted populations. We believe that our study and these recently published papers will be useful foundation and resource for future analysis of the molecular determinants of sensory neuron phenotype."

Note: Initial trials using traditional gating strategies (e.g., cell size, doublet discrimination, and scatter properties) did not eliminate non-neuronal cells. An important aspect of isolating pure neurons was based on the significantly higher fluorescence of the Rosa26-TdTomato reporter in somata compared to axonal debris, allowing accurate gating for cell bodies and purer neuronal signatures.

These data show significant decreases in myelin associated transcript expression in FACS purified samples relative to whole DRG samples (p&lt;0.001 by One-way ANOVA) and increases in neuronal transcript expression levels (p&lt;0.001 by One-way ANOVA). Overall signal intensity was higher for some microarray probesets, which may reflect greater probeset sensitivity or nonspecific background. For example, low level expression of certain transcripts were found in sorted samples (Mpz, Mbp), while other transcripts were not detected at all (Pmp2, Mag). Based on these data, our sorting methodology strongly enriches for neurons compared to whole DRG tissue, but we cannot rule out the presence of small numbers of non-neuronal cells.

For microarray whole transcriptome analysis, 100 ng RNA was required for reverse transcription, cDNA preparation using the Ambion WT Expression kit, which is a standard protocol in Genechip hybridization facilities. We actively chose to avoid performing pre-amplification steps using kits prior to this step, which often introduces transcript signal biases. As a result, sufficient RNA was more difficult to obtain from sorted populations, in particular Parv-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons, which make up only 12.5\u00b11.7% of DRG neurons). Thus, in order to obtain sufficient RNA for analysis without introducing amplification biases, we pooled cervical (C1-C8), thoracic (T1-T13), and lumbar DRGs (L1-L6). This is a limitation of our study, as certain anatomical regions are potentially more enriched for particular transcripts (e.g. lumbar vs. certical). To minimize technical variability, SNS-Cre/TdTomato (total, IB4<sup>+</sup>, IB4<sup>-</sup>) and Parv-Cre/TdTomato neurons were sorted on the same day. As the reviewer points out, developmental timepoint certainly influences gene expression, as distinct embryonic stage-dependent expression patterns likely determine specification of each subset. Preliminary analysis of neonatal SNS-Cre/TdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons (P2) show significant differences compared to our adult purified neurons (Data not shown). We discuss these imitations in the Discussion, and point out that more specific and targeted analysis will be important future studies."

We have added a new paragraph in our manuscript discussing how our study\u2019s approach and findings relate to these papers. In particular comparison to <i>Usokin et al</i>, we have some similar findings, including our Group VI pruriceptive neurons (IL31ra<sup>+</sup>). However, our analysis showed higher definition of Group I and Group VII neurons (distinctly more markers), as well as Group IV neurons which they did not detect. We note that each of these studies utilized distinct methodologies: two performed analysis of one neuronal population each (<i>Goswani et al, 2014;</i> <a href=\"#bib51\"><i>Thakur et al, 2014</i></a>), and one performed single cell RNA-seq but not population analysis (<i>Usokin et al, 2014</i>). We believe that our study possesses certain advantages as well as limitations in relation to these studies but remains a unique and important contribution."

                    "text": "In brief summary: a) <i>Goswami et al</i> profiled Trpv1 lineage neurons compared to Trpv1-DTA whole DRG tissues. b) <i>Thakur et al</i> performed magnetic bead selection to remove DRG non-neuronal cells, leaving neurons for a population RNA-seq analysis. c) <i>Usokin et al</i> performed single cell RNA-seq on hundreds of DRG neurons that were robotically picked in an unbiased fashion. In our study, we performed whole population analysis of 3 major DRG subsets, which we followed by single cell granular profiling of hundreds of cells from the same populations. We believe one advantage of our study is beginning with differential analysis of well-defined and functionally relevant populations. The two published population level studies did not perform comparative analysis with other distinct populations. We then further define each of our populations in detail using the single cell strategy, which gives us high-resolution analysis of functionally defined groups of cells. The same advantages of a population based strategy is also a caveat, in that it could introduce pre-determined bias, which <i>Usokin et al</i> purposely avoids by randomly picking single DRG neurons as a starting point. We note that our analysis is the only one to utilize parallel qRT-PCR of single cells, which we demonstrate is able to detect log-scale differences in expression (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>), and we believe may have better detection sensitivities compared to single cell RNA-seq. As genomic technologies and single cell sorting methodologies evolve, the limitations (e.g. RNA quantity) will be overcome and future analysis of thousands of single cells from distinct anatomical locations, developmental time-points, or following injury/inflammation will begin to reveal even more critical information about the somatosensory system. We believe that our study and these recently published papers are a critical foundation for such future analysis."
