Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of DHFR in <i>E. coli</i> causes a toxic metabolic imbalance triggered by interactions with several functionally related enzymes. Though deleterious in the overexpression regime, surprisingly, these interactions are beneficial at physiological concentrations, implying their functional significance <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, we found that overexpression of orthologous DHFR proteins had minimal effect on all levels of cellular organization \u2013 molecular, systems, and phenotypic, in sharp contrast to <i>E. coli</i> DHFR. Dramatic difference of GDT between \u2018<i>E. coli</i>\u2019s self\u2019 and \u2018foreign\u2019 proteins suggests the crucial role of evolutionary selection in shaping protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks at the whole proteome level. This study shows how protein overexpression perturbs a dynamic metabolon of weak yet potentially functional PPI, with consequences for the metabolic state of cells and their fitness."

Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of DHFR in <i>E. coli</i> causes a toxic metabolic imbalance triggered by interactions with several functionally related enzymes. Though deleterious in the overexpression regime, surprisingly, these interactions are beneficial at physiological concentrations, implying their functional significance <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, we found that overexpression of orthologous DHFR proteins had minimal effect on all levels of cellular organization \u2013 molecular, systems, and phenotypic, in sharp contrast to <i>E. coli</i> DHFR. Dramatic difference of GDT between \u2018<i>E. coli</i>\u2019s self\u2019 and \u2018foreign\u2019 proteins suggests the crucial role of evolutionary selection in shaping protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks at the whole proteome level. This study shows how protein overexpression perturbs a dynamic metabolon of weak yet potentially functional PPI, with consequences for the metabolic state of cells and their fitness."

Singh and Dash hypothesized that electrostatic mis-interactions might be responsible for GDT in bacteria, which, unlike yeast, mostly lack proteins with disordered regions (<a href=\"#bib60\">Singh and Dash, 2013</a>).

Pull-down assay coupled to LC-MS/MS revealed that over-expressed DHFR from <i>E. coli</i> and other bacteria interact with several enzymes in DHFR functional vicinity (folate pathway/purine biosynthesis), and <i>in vitro</i> analysis confirmed the presence of these weak interactions. However, the mutual effects on activity of DHFR and its interacting partners were markedly different between EcDHFR and its orthologues.

As expected, a drop in DHFR activity and/or abundance, induced by either genetic changes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bershtein et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2012</a>), or DHFR inhibition (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rodrigues, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kwon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sangurdekar et al., 2011</a>), results in reduced fitness. But what is the effect of an <i>increase</i> in DHFR dosage on fitness? To answer this question, we designed an experimental system capable of generating controlled variation in a broad range of intracellular DHFR abundance in <i>E. coli</i>, and measured the effect of these changes on growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A controlled drop in DHFR production was achieved by introducing LacI binding sites (<i>lacO</i>) in the chromosomal regulatory region of <i>folA</i> gene in a genetically modified <i>E. coli</i> strain constitutively expressing LacI (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and [<a href=\"#bib4\">Bershtein et al., 2013</a>]). Dialing down IPTG concentration (LacI repressor) resulted in a gradual decrease (over 100 fold) of the intracellular DHFR abundance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). A gradual increase in DHFR abundance (from\u00a0~5 to 850-fold) was achieved by transforming WT <i>E. coli</i> strain with a plasmid carrying <i>folA</i> gene under the control of arabinose inducible pBAD promoter (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> shows that both drop <i>and</i> increase in intracellular DHFR abundance result in severe reduction (up to 73%) in growth rate. Fitness as a function of DHFR abundance therefore shows an \u2018optimum\u2019 at the basal DHFR level. However, the shape of the DHFR abundance \u2013 fitness function appears to be very different between DHFR depletion and DHFR overexpression regimes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A drop in fitness upon DHFR depletion is well described by Michaelis-Menten like dependence predicted by metabolic flux kinetics (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kacser and Burns, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dykhuizen et al., 1987</a>) and verified experimentally (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bershtein et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rodrigues, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bershtein et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, the increase in the intracellular DHFR levels above the optimal (basal) level leads to a sigmoidal decline in fitness across the entire measured range of DHFR abundances (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The qualitative differences between DHFR depletion and overexpression regimes clearly indicate that different mechanisms are responsible for loss of fitness at higher and lower ends of DHFR abundance-fitness curve."

To address the possibility that the observed toxicity of DHFR overexpression is a result of protein expression burden, we measured the effect of expression of two other control proteins on bacterial growth under identical conditions: an endogenous essential protein adenylate kinase (ADK), and a non-endogenous human H-ras p21 (Ras), - a small globular protein with size and fold similar to DHFR (<a href=\"#bib11\">de Vos et al., 1988</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) At highest inducer concentration, Ras reached the abundance that is\u00a0~600 fold greater than that of the endogenous DHFR, while ADK copy number reached\u00a0~5000 fold increase over the physiological DHFR levels without causing any substantial drop in growth. Further, no toxicity was observed from an empty pBAD plasmid (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since <i>E. coli</i> DHFR and the control proteins are produced to comparable levels and from the same pBAD expression system, we conclude that the observed GDT of DHFR is protein specific and cannot be explained by either energetic or competition components of resource overload."

                                "text": "An increase in the intracellular concentration of proteins can induce potentially detrimental non-specific \u2018mis-interactions\u2019 that are not present at the level of endogenous abundances (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vavouri et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Heo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Maslov and Ispolatov, 2007</a>). Importantly, <i>E. coli</i> DHFR is a low copy monomeric enzyme (<a href=\"#bib66\">Taniguchi et al., 2010</a>) with no physical interactions detected with other proteins when used as a prey at its basal level (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hu et al., 2009</a>). Further, no DHFR interactions were detected in yeast, and only one in Drosophila [dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu]. We sought to determine possible interacting partners of over-expressed EcDHFR and two controls, ADK and Ras. To that end, protein complexes in cells were stabilized <i>in vivo</i> by a cell-permeable cross-linker, followed by cell lysis, immunoprecipitation (IP) performed on soluble lysates with polyclonal rabbit anti-EcDHFR, ADK, and Ras antibodies, and LC-MS/MS analysis (See <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>, overexpressed DHFR pulled out several interaction partners, while ADK and Ras picked very few (3\u20134), suggesting that cellular PPI is the most likely reason for the DHFR overexpression toxicity. We also compared the PPI profile of <i>E. coli</i> DHFR with its orthologue from <i>Bordetella avium</i> (DHFR11). Since anti-EcDHFR antibodies do not bind DHFR 11 due to a large sequence distance, His-tagged versions of both proteins were used in conjunction with mouse monoclonal anti-His antibodies (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods).\u00a0As a first step, we compared the PPI profiles of EcDHFR obtained with two different antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-EcDHFR and mouse monoclonal anti-His antibodies), and found that the anti-His antibody pulled out a smaller number of interacting proteins (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). This is probably because cellular PPI that target regions close to the N-terminal His-tag of DHFR cause steric hindrance for binding of anti-His antibodies. Despite this caveat, we went ahead to compare the PPI profiles of EcDHFR and orthologous DHFR 11 and found that DHFR 11 pulled out many more proteins than EcDHFR (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). Interestingly, almost all proteins constituting the EcDHFR interactome can also be found in the DHFR11 interactome. Why is then overexpression toxicity limited only to EcDHFR? A closer look into the set of 29 interacting proteins of EcDHFR that were common to both anti-EcDHFR and anti-His antibody pull-downs (Sheet 1 of <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>) allowed us to classify them according to their function (Sheet 2 of <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). While several proteins belong to carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis, there were several enzymes closely related to DHFR function, such as 1-carbon metabolism. Tetrahydrofolate, the product of DHFR is immediately taken up by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA) to produce 5,10-methylene-THF, which in a series of steps is subsequently used to produce dTMP from dUMP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). 5,10-methylene-THF is also utilized in a second pathway to produce <sup>10</sup>Nf-THF, which is then consumed in the last step of purine biosynthesis by PurH. Hence, partial inhibition of either of these paths can explain the metabolic imbalance and fitness cost associated with DHFR overexpression."

This observation suggests that if inhibition of purine biosynthesis through PPI with overexpressed DHFR is partly responsible for GDT, DHFR overexpression would be less toxic in LB. Indeed, we found that cells overexpressing DHFR do not show a reduction in \u2018growth rates\u2019 when grown in LB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), however there was a gradual drop in the saturation ODs at higher expression levels of DHFR (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This might be due to DHFR interaction with other 1-carbon metabolism enzymes (GlyA, ThyA) or enzymes belonging to carbohydrate metabolism, namely phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose-biphosphate aldolase, which are essential even in LB (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baba et al., 2006</a>). Further, we ran several complementation experiments in which we tested the effect of overexpression of enzymes involved in 1-carbon metabolism (schematically depicted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) on rescuing the DHFR overexpression toxicity. Most of these enzymes (with the exception of ThyA) were shown to interact with overexpressed DHFR in the IP/LC-MS/MS assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, overexpression of PurH, PurC, ThyA, and MetF resulted in a moderate yet significant alleviation of DHFR dosage toxicity, validating some of the interactions detected in IP. However the rescue was only moderate, as most of these proteins themselves were toxic upon over-expression (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A protein involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, TrpE, was detected in IP, which, if sequestered, might lead to a drop in tryptophan levels in the cell. Indeed addition of tryptophan to the growth medium partly rescued the growth defect of DHFR over-expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), again validating the functional significance of the IP-detected interactions."

However, despite its importance, there are no experimental \u2018case studies\u2019 that uncover molecular underpinnings of GDT. Here we carried out a study whereby we focus on a specific gene, <i>folA,</i> and delineate, in great detail and on multiple scales, the molecular mechanism of DHFR dosage toxicity in <i>E. coli</i>. We showed that fitness cost of DHFR overexpression could only be understood by integrating the metabolic and protein-protein interaction networks of the organism. Specifically, interactions between DHFR and several other metabolic enzymes, lead to a reduced flux through the purine, pyrimidine and amino acids synthesis paths. The imbalance in protein-protein interactions caused by overexpression of DHFR leads to a dead-end metabolic imbalance, such as the accumulation of AICAR \u2013 a precursor of inosine-5\u2019-phosphate, and reduced growth. Overexpression of highly active but diverged orthologous DHFR caused only minor change in metabolite pools and fitness, indicating that neither protein burden nor metabolic cost per se can explain the endogenous DHFR dosage toxicity. The comprehensive IP/LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed by <i>in vitro</i> measurements of selected pairs of proteins clearly point out to spurious PPI formed between the overexpressed DHFR and several other metabolically and functionally related proteins in <i>E. coli</i> cytoplasm as the most probable cause of GDT."

This key finding clearly suggests the crucial role of evolutionary selection in shaping PPI at the whole proteome level. Remarkably, we found that at the physiological concentrations weak transient PPI can enhance the enzymatic activity of DHFR, provided that the interacting proteins are <i>from the same organism</i>. Further, we found that overexpressed \u2018foreign\u2019 DHFR pulls up many more interaction partners from <i>E. coli</i> proteome than does EcDHFR, suggesting that DHFR was subjected to selection against promiscuous mis-interactions in <i>E. coli</i> cytoplasm. Thus, evolution of the PPI network entails both positive <i>and</i> negative selection for transient interactions. Transient interactions between a select set of metabolically related proteins might be beneficial because they can enhance catalytic efficiency through ligand channeling. Conversely, they can be selected against to avoid massive non-functional promiscuous PPI. The weaker binding of EcDHFR to GlyA (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>) may also be indicative of a selection against transient interactions, as higher copy number enzymes, like GlyA, (expressed at\u00a0~10,000 copies/cell, [<a href=\"#bib66\">Taniguchi et al., 2010</a>]) are more prone to mis-interact, comparatively to less abundant proteins, such as PurH (expressed at\u00a0~200 copies per cell [<a href=\"#bib66\">Taniguchi et al., 2010</a>]). Earlier theoretical analyses envisioned both scenarios: selection against massive non-functional PPI (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vavouri et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Heo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Levy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), and selection for interactions between metabolically related enzymes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Huthmacher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Durek and Walther, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Huthmacher et al., 2007</a>). This work provides experimental evidence that both these factors are indeed at play in evolution of PPI and metabolic networks."

Seminal work carried out by Srere and colleagues first showed existence of such a functional supramolecular complex of sequential enzymes from Kreb\u2019s cycle in yeast, which led to coining of the term \u2018metabolon\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Srere, 1987</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Robinson and Srere, 1985</a>). This was thought to be an efficient mechanism to channel common intermediates through the pathway and thereby prevent them from escaping into solution. In other words, it would also increase the local concentration of substrate and help to carry out an efficient reaction with relatively low copy number of substrate molecules. During the same time, the term \u2018quinary structure\u2019 (the fifth level of protein structural organization) was coined by McConkey (<a href=\"#bib45\">McConkey, 1982</a>) to describe transient protein-protein interactions. These interactions are not only low in thermodynamic stability (K<sub>D</sub>\u00a0&gt;\u00a01 \u03bcM), but also have a low kinetic barrier (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wirth and Gruebele, 2013</a>), thereby making them amenable to modulation by cellular variations like metabolite concentrations, pH (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen and Pielak, 2016</a>), crowding, etc. Till date, the multi-enzyme complex metabolon remains to be the best example of a quinary structure. Recent studies have uncovered the role of quinary structures in modulating <i>in vivo</i> protein stability (<a href=\"#bib47\">Monteith et al., 2015</a>). Our study unfolds a hitherto unexplored aspect of quinary structures: its role in gene-dosage toxicity."

Our study also shows that GDT of DHFR is triggered by potentially weak functional interactions gone \u2018awry\u2019 under the overexpression regime that causes a stoichiometric PPI imbalance and formation of permanent complexes in lieu of transient ones. However, unlike these studies, we show that the actual cause of the overexpression toxicity is the metabolic imbalance that ensues once the permanent PPIs are formed. Apparently, actual \u2018mis-interactions\u2019 are formed upon overexpression of orthologous DHFR proteins. In contrast to the previous studies, however, these interactions happen to be much less toxic than those picked by <i>E. coli</i> DHFR, at least at the experimental level of resolution. Nevertheless, weaker fitness effects of mis-interactions can affect evolution of the proteome to minimize promiscuous PPI (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Levy et al., 2012</a>), and our finding that non-endogenous DHFRs pulls out more interacting partners than EcDHFR points in this direction."

In contrast to protein stability, whose landscape is largely monotonic, at least for some proteins (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rodrigues, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bershtein et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bloom et al., 2006</a>), fitness landscape for protein abundances is non-monotonic for many proteins, reaching an optimum at certain levels. While loss of fitness at low abundance is intuitively associated with loss of function, the GDT at high abundance is a system-level collective effect, related to interactions with multiple proteins as well as the link between PPI and metabolic networks, as shown here for DHFR. Apparently, specific functional demands dictate certain minimal amounts of proteins. Evolution of biophysical and biochemical parameters (activity, stability, and affinity to a functional protein and DNA partners) provide significant leverage to avoid prohibitively high expression levels which might cause GDT. Nevertheless, there is a certain evolutionary cost of maintaining high levels of activity and/or functional interaction strength due to supply of potentially deleterious mutations. Future studies will fully reveal the extent to which GDT affects evolved distributions of molecular properties of proteins and their abundances."

A modified <i>E. coli</i> MG1655 strain where the chromosomal DHFR has been replaced with DHFR from another mesophilic bacterium (<i>Pasteurella multocida</i>) is termed as \u2018DHFR3 strain\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bershtein et al., 2015</a>). The amino acid sequences of DHFR from <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Pasteurella multocida</i> have a low identity (52%), and hence DHFR3 protein does not bind the polyclonal anti-DHFR antibody. Using a paired t-test, we found that the average number of peptides for all observed proteins in the sample dataset (3 repeats of pBAD-EcDHFR) was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) than the average number of peptides for the same proteins in five control experiments (two repeats of MG1655 and three repeats of DHFR3). Hence for our analysis, we considered a particular protein to be a true positive interacting partner of DHFR if its average number of peptides in the sample was greater than the average number of its peptides in the control. As expected, the filtered dataset was also significantly different from the background data. All repeat experiments were biological replicates (different colonies of transformed cells)."

Since the orthologous DHFRs have very low sequence identity with <i>E. coli</i> DHFR, the polyclonal antibodies raised against <i>E. coli</i> DHFR do not recognize the orthologous proteins To be able to perform the intracellular quantifications of DHFR abundances, to conduct the IP experiments, and to have an efficient protein purification tool for the in vitro measurements, DHFR proteins were His-tagged at their C-terminus. To validate that the presence or absence of the His-tag in either <i>E. coli</i> or orthologous DHFR proteins do not affect the observed fitness effects of DHFR overproduction, we generated both tagged and untagged versions of EcDHFR, and orthologous DHFR6 and DHFR11, overexpressed these proteins, and measured the resulting growth rates. We found that the presence or absence of His-tag had no effect on <i>E. coli</i> DHFR gene dosage toxicity \u2013 both protein versions showed identical levels of toxicity. Similarly, presence or absence of His-tag did not affect at all the lack of toxicity of orthologous DHFR proteins.

In other words, over-expressed Adk does not interact with other proteins in the cell, and we believe this must the reason for the lack of growth defect. However which specific properties of the protein would decide its propensity to interact with other proteins is immediately unclear from the present study. A possible reason might be the following: our study shows that DHFR engages in weak interactions with its functional neighbors, possibly through formation of a metabolon. This is especially important for its function since DHFR is part of a pathway of 1-carbon metabolism, hence formation of a metabolon would facilitate exchange of ligands. In contrast, Adk is a stand-alone enzyme that is fully reversible, and thereby maintains the balance of adenylate currencies (ATP, ADP, AMP) in the cell. Hence it is possible that Adk does not have a significant number of functional neighbors. To test if this is universally true for all stand-alone enzymes can be a topic of an interesting future study."
