The arrival of an electrical signal, called an action potential, at a neuronal synapse causes an influx of calcium ions into the cell. This in turn causes packages of chemicals called neurotransmitters that are stored inside the cell to fuse with the neuron's membrane, which releases their contents from the neuron. These molecules bind to the cell on the other side of the synapse (another neuron or a muscle cell), and the action potential can be regenerated."

In a clear demonstration of homeostatic depression, the larvae compensate for their altered condition by releasing fewer of their extra large packages in response to each action potential. Mutations that disrupt homeostatic potentiation have no effect on this process, suggesting that the two processes work via separate mechanisms. Indeed, further experiments reveal that synapses achieve homeostatic depression by reducing the number of calcium channels in the membrane. This limits the entry of calcium\u2014and thus the release of neurotransmitters\u2014in response to each action potential."

To do so, homeostatic signaling systems require bi-directional control, being able to accurately offset perturbations that persistently increase or decrease the excitation of neurons or muscle. An evolutionarily conserved, bi-directional form of homeostatic signaling is observed at the neuromuscular junction of organisms ranging from <i>Drosophila</i> to human (see <a href=\"#bib6\">Davis, 2013</a> for review). At the <i>Drosophila</i> NMJ, inhibition of postsynaptic glutamate receptor function leads to a compensatory increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter release that precisely restores normal muscle depolarization (<a href=\"#bib31\">Petersen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Davis and Goodman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Davis et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Frank et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Davis, 2013</a>). This is referred to as presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). An opposing process, presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD), can be induced by presynaptic overexpression of the vesicular glutamate transporter (<i>vGlut2</i>), which causes an increase in the amount of glutamate packaged within individual synaptic vesicles and a corresponding increase in synaptic vesicle diameter (<a href=\"#bib5\">Daniels et al., 2004</a>). These larger vesicles produce larger average spontaneous miniature excitatory post-synaptic potentials (mEPSPs). A homeostatic decrease in presynaptic vesicle release, however, maintains evoked EPSP amplitudes at wild type levels despite increased mEPSP amplitude (<a href=\"#bib5\">Daniels et al., 2004</a>)."

Can PHP and PHD be simultaneously induced to adjust presynaptic release? If so, can the expression of PHP and PHD be coordinated to produce an accurate homeostatic response, precisely offsetting the magnitude of the perturbation? Are PHP and PHD controlled by the same signaling system(s) or are they independently controlled and coordinated? Ultimately, understanding how these signaling systems interface requires the identification and characterization of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive PHP and PHD. Although significant progress has been made in identifying the mechanisms that participate in PHP (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frank et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dickman and Davis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tsurudome et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">M\u00fcller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">M\u00fcller and Davis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Younger et al., 2013</a>), nothing is known regarding the cellular or molecular mechanisms responsible for PHD (<a href=\"#bib5\">Daniels et al., 2004</a>)."

Further, we demonstrate that PHD is achieved by a regulated decrease in presynaptic calcium channel abundance and concomitant decrease in presynaptic calcium influx. The regulated control of active-zone associated calcium channel abundance represents a novel mechanism of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Importantly, this mechanism is consistent with the simultaneous induction of both PHP and PHD. As such, bi-directional, rheostat-like adjustment of presynaptic release could reasonably be achieved by the coordinated expression of two independent homeostatic signaling systems at the NMJ."

A system that is under true homeostatic control should be able to accurately offset a wide range of perturbation. This was previously shown for PHP by plotting the average mEPSP amplitude against average quantal content for each recording made from an individual NMJ. In this analysis, the data lie along a line associated with near perfect compensation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frank et al., 2006</a>). We constructed a similar plot, including recordings from <i>vGlut-</i>OE NMJ as well as wild type NMJ and NMJ that were incubated in sub-blocking concentrations of the glutamate receptor antagonist philanthotoxin-433 (PhTx), and observed a wide range of mEPSP amplitudes, ranging from &gt;2 mV to less than 0.4 mV. These data produced points lying along a clear line, providing evidence for continuous adjustment of presynaptic release, effectively maintaining a constant EPSP amplitude over a wide range of average mEPSP amplitude values (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Moreover, each segment of the data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> (shown by different colors), when fit independently, showed a negative relationship between mEPSP amplitude and presynaptic release. This indicates that, as with PHP, the mechanisms of PHD can respond to small changes in the average mEPSP amplitude and adjust presynaptic release accordingly. In conclusion, these data suggest that PHD could be part of an integrated, bi-directional, homeostatic signaling system at the NMJ."

Since <i>vGlut</i>2 overexpression is a presynaptic perturbation and PhTx is a postsynaptic perturbation, both PHD and PHP can be induced concurrently. First, we found that PhTx application to <i>vGlut</i>-OE terminals significantly reduced mEPSP amplitudes in a manner quantitatively similar to that observed when PhTx is applied to wild type NMJ (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). At both wild type and <i>vGlut</i>-OE NMJ, the 50\u201360% drop in average mEPSP amplitude was offset by an approximate doubling of presynaptic neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). As a result, in both wild type and <i>vGlut</i>-OE NMJ, EPSP amplitudes were maintained at or near wild type levels after PhTx application (a slight decrease in EPSP amplitude was observed in <i>vGlut</i>-OE animals, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, there was no difference in EPSP amplitude comparing wild type (+PhTx) and <i>vGlut</i>-OE (+PhTx; p &gt; 0.05). Thus, despite the fact that <i>vGlut</i>-OE NMJ chronically express PHD during larval development, application of PhTx is able to induce expression of PHP that appears unaffected by prior induction of PHD. From these results, several conclusions can be made. First, these data demonstrate that the mechanisms of PHP and PHD can co-exist at a single NMJ and can be sequentially induced, at least in the sequence that we performed in this study. The reagents to perform the reverse sequence do not currently exist as there is no pharmacological or acute genetic manipulation that can rapidly increase mEPSP amplitude. Second, the data argue that the reduced presynaptic release caused by <i>vGlut</i>2 overexpression is not a secondary effect whereby <i>vGlut</i>2 overabundance disrupts the vesicle fusion apparatus, since release can be precisely potentiated at this NMJ. Finally, these data demonstrate that the mechanisms of PHP and PHD can be effectively combined to fine tune presynaptic release."

Briefly, in either a glutamate receptor mutant background, or following acute application of PhTx to the NMJ, subsequent pharmacological inhibition of the presynaptic ENaC channel, or genetic mutation of the gene encoding an essential subunit of this channel, eliminates the expression of homeostatic potentiation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Younger et al., 2013</a>). A current model suggests that sodium leak through newly membrane-inserted ENaC channels drives presynaptic membrane depolarization, a subsequent potentiation of presynaptic calcium influx, and enhanced neurotransmitter release. Importantly, ENaC channels do not appear to be present on the membrane under baseline conditions since deletion or pharmacological blockade of these channels does not decrease baseline neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib39\">Younger et al., 2013</a>). If ENaC channels are not present on the membrane at rest, then these channels should not have a role in PHD. To test this possibility, we applied the ENaC channel inhibitor benzamil (25 \u00b5M) to wild type and <i>vGlut</i>-OE NMJ. We found no significant effect of benzamil on presynaptic release at <i>vGlut</i>-OE NMJ, consistent with the expectation that ENaC channels do not participate in baseline release in wild type animals and, therefore, cannot be removed as a mechanism underlying PHD. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). As a control, we tested whether application of Benzamil still prevents PHP expression in the <i>vGlut-</i>OE background. We found that this is, indeed, the case (<i>vGlut</i>-OE +Benzamil: mEPSP = 0.83 \u00b1 0.05 mV, QC = 39.2 \u00b1 2.3; <i>vGlut</i>-OE +Benzamil +PhTx: mEPSP = 0.50 \u00b1 0.02 mV, QC = 43.6 \u00b1 3.0; quantal content is statistically unchanged; p = 0.29, n &gt; 10).

The voltage sensitive properties of Archaerhodopsin can be used to visualize the presynaptic action potential waveform with high temporal resolution (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ford and Davis, 2014</a>). Importantly, this technique has sufficient temporal resolution to quantify changes in action potential half-width that correlate with either a 50% increase or decrease in neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ford and Davis, 2014</a>). Therefore, this tool has sufficient sensitivity to resolve changes in action potential waveform that might be responsible for PHD or PHP."

This level of Arch-GFP expression does not alter baseline synapse function or anatomy (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ford and Davis, 2014</a>). To image voltage, we performed confocal spot measurements, using GFP to localize the spot to the edges of individual synaptic boutons. Importantly, spot confocal imaging does not alter action potential propagation past the imaging site to a distal extracellular recording site within an NMJ and spot excitation at 643 nm has no effect on baseline neurotransmission (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ford and Davis, 2014</a>).

We found a small, but significant, decrease in WHM following PhTx application, but this is in the opposite direction expected for the potentiation of neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Next, we observed the AP waveform in <i>vGlut-</i>OE animals. This experiment was performed at two different extracellular calcium concentrations: low extracellular calcium (0.4 mM) typically used to examine synaptic transmission in current clamp configuration, and at physiological calcium (1.5 mM) to control for the recent observation that action potential repolarization is faster at elevated extracellular calcium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, far right, compare black and gray traces; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ford and Davis, 2014</a>). In both cases, there was no change in AP waveform comparing wild type with <i>vGlut-</i>OE animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>)<i>.</i> We also controlled for the possibility that Arch-GFP imaging might alter the expression of PHP or PHD by recording neuromuscular transmission from the same genotypes in which we quantified AP waveforms. We found that both PHP, using either PhTx or the <i>GluRIIA</i> mutation, and PHD occur normally in the presence of Arch-GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). From these data, we conclude that the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, either PHP or PHD, is not correlated with a change in AP waveform measured at the presynaptic nerve terminal."

As a measure of P<sub>r</sub>, we calculated the fraction of the total RRP released following the first action potential in a stimulus train, a value referred to as P<sub>train</sub> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</a>). Using this method, we found P<sub>train</sub> to be significantly lower in <i>vGlut</i>-OE animals as compared to wild type, indicating reduced presynaptic release probability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Examining accumulated synaptic depression during a short stimulus train, however, we observed only a mild, not statistically significant, difference in the rate of depression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Finally, we assessed paired pulse stimulation at low extracellular calcium (0.3 mM) at a range of inter-stimulus intervals and found no change in paired-pulse depression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In summary, we observed a significant reduction in P<sub>train</sub>, but this change was not reflected by a change in short-term release dynamics as measured with paired-pulse stimulation at low extracellular calcium. Thus, while pool usage is altered under conditions of high release during a stimulus train, the pool of vesicles is apparently large enough to obscure a change in paired-pulse release dynamics under conditions of low release.

In order to measure CaV2.1 abundance, we first labeled presynaptic active zones with an antibody against the active zone-associated protein Bruchpilot (Brp), which has previously been shown to surround presynaptic calcium channels based on super-resolution microscopy (<a href=\"#bib20\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). We then labeled CaV2.1-GFP with an antibody against GFP and measured the fluorescence intensity of the signal at active zones, using Brp puncta to define the ROI.

Since <i>UAS-CaV2.1-GFP</i> expression is independent of the normal transcriptional regulation of the <i>CaV2.1</i> gene locus, these data additionally suggest that CaV2.1 levels are not modulated at the level of transcription during PHD, but rather that CaV2.1 protein is selectively restricted from entering the active zone or is selectively removed from the active zone.

This mechanism is consistent with the co-expression and co-regulation of PHD and PHP, achieving bi-directional homeostatic control of neurotransmission at the NMJ. More specifically, recent data support a model in which PHP is driven by the regulated insertion of an ENaC channel in the presynaptic membrane. This is thought to cause a modest depolarization of the presynaptic membrane, subsequent potentiation of calcium influx and enhanced vesicle release (<a href=\"#bib6\">Davis, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Younger et al., 2013</a>). This mechanism should function normally, regardless of a change in the number of presynaptic calcium channels per active zone. Therefore, if PHD is driven by a decrease in calcium channel number, PHP can be subsequently induced through insertion of presynaptic ENaC channels. Consistent with this idea, application of an ENaC channel blocker prevents expression of PHP in the <i>vGlut-</i>OE background. Although the proposed mechanisms of PHP and PHD are compatible, it is none-the-less remarkable that PHP and PHD can be combined to precisely target the correct EPSP amplitude, offsetting two persistent perturbations: enlarged presynaptic vesicles, and impaired postsynaptic glutamate receptor sensitivity. The mechanisms that enable PHP and PHD to be combined in this manner remain to be elucidated. Our data indicate that the genetic underpinnings responsible for PHP and PHD are distinct, since three conditions that block PHP have no impact on PHD. Thus, we propose that rheostat-like modulation of presynaptic release is achieved by the intersection of two distinct signaling systems driving PHP and PHD."

This is due, in part, to the limited number of reagents for visualizing presynaptic calcium channels and the fact that active zones in most areas of the nervous system are small structures, at or near the diffraction limit of light. Although auxiliary calcium channel subunits such as \u03b12\u03b4 have mutant phenotypes that affect presynaptic calcium influx and calcium channel abundance (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dickman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ly et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hoppa et al., 2012</a>), it remains unknown whether these auxiliary subunits acutely modulate calcium channel abundance in response to activity, as opposed to simply establishing and maintaining baseline expression levels during development and throughout the life of a synapse. As such, exploration of how calcium channel abundance is modulated during PHD should be of considerable interest."

Furthermore, because we measured CaV2.1-GFP driven from a transgene under control of the GAL4-UAS expression system, whatever mechanisms are at play during PHD likely act downstream of calcium channel transcription. Therefore, we hypothesize that PHD is driven either by restricting CaV2.1 abundance at the level of translation, or by the regulated internalization and degradation of presynaptic CaV2.1 calcium channels."

However, the documented \u223c50% decrease in CaV2.1-GFP abundance is mirrored, quantitatively, by a \u223c50% drop in the spatially averaged presynaptic calcium signal in response to single action potential stimulation. Furthermore, baseline neurotransmitter release is unaltered by CaV2.1-GFP overexpression, consistent with prior observations (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kawasaki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that the CaV2.1-GFP containing channels replace endogenous, untagged channels with little or no change in total calcium channel number at the active zone.

The magnitude of the decrease in calcium channel abundance and presynaptic calcium influx should cause a much larger decrease in quantal content that what we observe during PHD. More specifically, the relationship between release and external calcium is a power function with an exponent of approximately three at the <i>Drosophila</i> NMJ (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dickman and Davis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">M\u00fcller et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, a 50% drop in the spatially averaged calcium signal should decrease release by more than the observed 30%. The reason for this discrepancy remains unknown. We recently documented a linear relationship between the RRP and extracellular calcium at this synapse (<a href=\"#bib27\">M\u00fcller et al., 2015</a>), consistent with similar observations at the mammalian calyx of held (<a href=\"#bib34\">Thanawala and Regehr, 2013</a>). One possibility, therefore, is that the mechanisms of PHD include two inter-dependent processes. First, there is a drop in calcium channel abundance. Second, there is a mechanism that potentiates the RRP to achieve precise homeostatic compensation. This hypothetical, calcium-independent, potentiation of the RRP would offset the expected reduction in the RRP attributable to decreased calcium influx and result in an RRP measurement that does not appear to change during PHD. If this model is correct, it should be possible to isolate mutations that interfere with the latter mechanism and cause presynaptic release to drop below the levels normally seen for precise PHD. This is not observed when a <i>rim</i> mutation is placed in the background of <i>vGlut</i>-OE animals, indicating that any such mechanism must be independent of the activity of RIM."

Because this increase in P<sub>r</sub> would occur in addition to increased quantal size, one would expect a much larger compensatory response as compared to perturbing quantal size alone, therefore explaining the apparent outsized reduction in calcium influx. This model would also explain why only a mild reduction in P<sub>train</sub> is observed electrophysiologically at <i>vGlut-OE</i> synapses, despite the large decrease in presynaptic calcium influx. Further exploration of PHD should clarify whether <i>vGlut2</i> overexpression itself increases P<sub>r</sub> and/or whether additional mechanisms exist to oppose CaV2.1 down-regulation."

In the presence of both perturbations, the homeostatic signaling system is able to restore EPSP amplitudes to precisely wild type levels. Because PhTx induces homeostatic potentiation in 10 min, and because there does not appear to be a reservoir of CaV2.1 channels present extra-synaptically in <i>vGlut</i>-OE animals, it is unlikely that there is sufficient time to repopulate all of the active zones at the NMJ with calcium channels, thereby erasing PHD and allowing the system to function solely according to PHP. Thus, the correct restoration of EPSP amplitude likely occurs through the summation of PHP and PHD. In this model, the overexpression of <i>vGlut</i> induces PHD and establishes a new steady state marked by increased mEPSP amplitude and decreased calcium channel abundance, with subsequent PhTx application independently inducing PHP through trafficking of ENaC channels to the presynaptic membrane. This model predicts that the opposite order of perturbation, early induction of PHP with a subsequent acute induction of PHD, would have a similar outcome, though the reagents to test this possibility do not yet exist."

                                "text": "Confocal spot imaging was made from type 1b boutons on muscle 6/7 of abdominal segments 2\u20134 of third instar larvae using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Ultima, Prairie Technologies). Excitation light (643 nm, 4 mW at back of objective) from an air-cooled solid-state laser was focused onto the specimen using a 60\u00d7 objective (1.0 NA, Olympus). The emission path consisted of a quad band 405, 488, 515, 643 nm dichroic, 500 nm long pass filter, 600 nm dichroic, and 700/75 nm and 525/40 nm band pass emission filters for Arch and GFP emissions, respectively. Arch emission was detected with a gallium arsenide phosphide-based photocathode photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu) and GFP emission was detected by a second PMT. Spot imaging from edges of single boutons was made at a sampling frequency of 4 kHz. A 1 ms stimulation of the nerve fiber was used to evoke action potentials after 60 ms of baseline image acquisition. 30\u201350 events were collected for each bouton at an inter-stimulus rate of 0.5 Hz for single action potentials and an inter-train interval of 0.1 Hz for trains of five stimuli. 1\u20135 boutons per synapse were imaged. For experiments using 1.5 mM calcium, 10 \u03bcM Philanthotoxin-433 (Sigma) or 100 \u03bcM 1-Naphthylacetyl spermine (Sigma) was included in the saline to prevent contraction during stimulation. Imaging data were analyzed using custom-written routines in Matlab (Mathworks; custom script submitted with this manuscript) and digitally filtered at 2 kHz. Fluorescence signals consisted of an exponentially decaying signal that derives from tissue fluorescence and is independent of Arch fluorescence, a rapid increase in Arch fluorescence that occurs during the first 10 ms of the photocycle (<a href=\"#bib22\">Maclaurin et al., 2013</a>), and the voltage dependent change in Arch fluorescence. To isolate voltage dependent changes in fluorescence, we fit a single exponential from 10 ms after the start of imaging to 5 ms before stimulus onset. This fit, which approximates the tissue fluorescence as well as the baseline Arch fluorescence, was extrapolated and subtracted from the fluorescence. Traces containing extra action potentials were removed. The resulting fluorescence measurements were averaged for each bouton and the average waveform was used to determine peak amplitude, full width, and width at half maximum (WHM). To obtain precise width and WHM measurements, we used linear interpolation between data sampling points. Due to the inability to accurately measure baseline Arch fluorescence in the presence of tissue fluorescence and Arch localized to internal membranes, amplitude measurements are not reported. Average AP waveforms for each experimental condition were peak-aligned and normalized before averaging."

The experiments employ state of the art electrophysiological, imaging, genetic, and morphological labeling techniques. The observations that the two forms of homeostasis occur via independent mechanisms and can be co-expressed (at least with genetic and pharmacological manipulations) are quite intriguing. The figures are very clear and show necessary data. The writing is crisp and clear. This paper should provoke wide interest among the readers of <i>eLife</i>."
