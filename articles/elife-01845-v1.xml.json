These neurons are further divided into lateral and medial groups, and although the axons projecting from these neurons leave the spinal cord together, their paths diverge within the limb to target dorsal and ventral muscles respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Axons at this branching point must decide which region of the limb to enter, and then continue growing to reach all the muscles that control the movement of that limb. So how do the axons decide which road to take? The answer lies in the combinations of axon guidance signals provided by the developing limb, which give specific directions about where each axon should and should not grow (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bonanomi and Pfaff, 2010</a>). In the absence of these signals, a dorsal axon might accidentally travel to the ventral muscles, or vice versa, resulting in what is called a guidance phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Helmbacher et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Huber et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Luria et al., 2008</a>)."

However, the absence of Frizzled3 (Fz3)\u2014a planar polarity protein that acts as a receptor in the well-known Wnt signalling pathway\u2014also leads to serious defects in the central nervous system, notably a complete absence of many nerve tracts (<a href=\"#bib11\">Wang et al., 2002</a>). These phenotypes seem to be caused by changes in the ability of growth cones to turn towards Wnt signals (<a href=\"#bib7\">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Shafer et al., 2011</a>), confirming that planar polarity proteins \u2018give directions\u2019 to the axons, just like axon guidance molecules do."

Through a detailed analysis of innervation patterns in the limbs, they show that the absence of Fz3 causes axons that should travel to the dorsal muscles to instead stall at the branch point (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, these axons follow the right path but stop growing, likely because their growth cones cannot figure out which way to go. This stalling phenotype is fundamentally different from previously described guidance phenotypes, where the axons do eventually reach a target, albeit the wrong one."

Intriguingly, other cranial nerves also stall in <i>Fz3</i> mutants, yet only a subset show an increase in cell death, suggesting that not all nerves require intermediate support. Are certain motor axons predisposed to require such support? Or do the unaffected motor axons rely on other members of the Frizzled family for their survival? What are the survival signals themselves, and do the same proteins also help axons choose their route?"

Understanding how all these pathways coalesce to produce a stereotyped trail of axon growth is proving to be an exciting path of research\u2014thankfully, it does not involve the same perils."
