For example, damage-associated molecular patterns activate an inflammatory cascade that leads to removal of cellular debris and promotion of healing. We demonstrate that lysis of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> cells triggers a program in the remaining population that confers fitness in interspecies co-culture. We find that this program, termed <i>P. aeruginosa</i> response to antagonism (PARA), involves rapid deployment of antibacterial factors and is mediated by the Gac/Rsm global regulatory pathway. Type VI secretion, and, unexpectedly, conjugative type IV secretion within competing bacteria, induce <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lysis and activate PARA, thus providing a mechanism for the enhanced capacity of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to target bacteria that elaborate these factors. Our finding that bacteria sense damaged kin and respond via a widely distributed pathway to mount a complex response raises the possibility that danger sensing is an evolutionarily conserved process."
