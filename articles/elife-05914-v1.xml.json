In this study, we show that mice overexpressing galectin-8, a secreted mammalian lectin of the galectins family, exhibit accelerated osteoclasts activity and bone turnover, which culminates in reduced bone mass, similar to cases of postmenopausal osteoporosis and cancerous osteolysis. This phenotype can be attributed to a direct action of galectin-8 on primary cultures of osteoblasts that secrete the osteoclastogenic factor RANKL upon binding of galectin-8. This results in enhanced differentiation into osteoclasts of the bone marrow cells co-cultured with galectin-8-treated osteoblasts. Secretion of RANKL by galectin-8-treated osteoblasts can be attributed to binding of galectin-8 to receptor complexes that positively (uPAR and MRC2) and negatively (LRP1) regulate galectin-8 function. Our findings identify galectins as new players in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling, and highlight a potential regulation of bone mass by animal lectins."

In this study, we show that mice overexpressing galectin-8, a secreted mammalian lectin of the galectins family, exhibit accelerated osteoclasts activity and bone turnover, which culminates in reduced bone mass, similar to cases of postmenopausal osteoporosis and cancerous osteolysis. This phenotype can be attributed to a direct action of galectin-8 on primary cultures of osteoblasts that secrete the osteoclastogenic factor RANKL upon binding of galectin-8. This results in enhanced differentiation into osteoclasts of the bone marrow cells co-cultured with galectin-8-treated osteoblasts. Secretion of RANKL by galectin-8-treated osteoblasts can be attributed to binding of galectin-8 to receptor complexes that positively (uPAR and MRC2) and negatively (LRP1) regulate galectin-8 function. Our findings identify galectins as new players in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling, and highlight a potential regulation of bone mass by animal lectins."

In most adult organisms, new bone is created at the same rate at which old bone is destroyed. This means that overall bone mass remains the same. But, in diseases such as osteoporosis or bone cancer, bone is destroyed more rapidly than at which new bone is made. This leads to brittle bones that are more likely to fracture. Understanding how to increase the rate of bone renewal might therefore help scientists develop new treatments for bone diseases."

This is because osteoclast activity increases at a greater rate, resulting in an overall loss of bone in these animals. This is similar to what occurs in some individuals with osteoporosis. These experiments therefore suggest that galectin-8 plays an important role in bone remodeling and that it may be a potential target for drugs that treat diseases that weaken bones."

As a result, co-culture of galectin-8-treated osteoblasts with bone marrow cells increases their differentiation into active osteoclasts. These effects involve the binding of galectin-8 to the osteoblasts' urokinase plasminogen-activated receptor (uPAR); mannose receptor C, type 2 (MRC2); and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), and seem to be of physiological relevance because galectin-8 transgenic animals exhibit increased expression of RANKL, increased osteoclastogenic activity, and enhanced bone turnover that culminates in reduced bone mass. These data identify galectin-8 as a potential drug target for the prevention of diseases associated with excessive bone loss."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, such treatment increased by sixfold the expression of RANKL in these cells by 4 hr and resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in secretion of soluble RANKL into the medium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) by 24 hr. Extended incubation with galectin-8, up to 6 days maintained the high levels of expression of RANKL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Galectin-8 also had a moderate (30%) inhibitory effect on the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a neutralizing decoy receptor of RANKL (<a href=\"#bib22\">Eriksen, 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). As a result, there was an overall 10-fold decrease in the ratio of OPG/RANKL transcription in galectin-8-treated osteoblasts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We could therefore conclude that galectin-8 increases the RANKL/OPG ratio in osteoblasts in a cell autonomous manner. We have previously shown that galectin-8 is secreted and localizes to the extracellular surface of cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hadari et al., 2000</a>). To determine whether galectin-8, secreted from osteoblasts, exerts similar effects, the expression of this lectin in osteoblasts was silenced using siRNA. As a result, a reduction of 87% in the expression levels of galectin-8 was accompanied by a significant reduction of 33% in the expression levels of RANKL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We could therefore conclude that galectin-8 derived from osteoblasts can mediate RANKL expression, along with other stimuli that induce RANKL."

For this purpose, bone marrow cells were co-cultured with osteoblasts derived from calvaria of newborn mice. We could demonstrate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) that galectin-8, added to this co-culture, was equipotent to the osteoclastogenic factor PGE<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Suda et al., 2004</a>) in the induction of a \u223c15-fold increase in osteoclast differentiation, as evident by the appearance of multinucleated TRAP<sup>+</sup> cells. The effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> and galectin-8 were additive to a certain extent, suggesting that they might act by somewhat different mechanisms. Very few differentiated osteoclasts appeared in untreated co-cultures. Furthermore, galectin-8 had no direct differentiation effect on osteoclasts, as addition of this lectin to naive bone marrow cells in the absence of osteoblasts did not result in osteoclasts differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To verify that RANKL indeed mediates the effects of galectin-8 on osteoclasts differentiation, its expression was silenced using siRNAs. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, RANKL-siRNAs reduced its transcription in osteoblasts by 50%, and this was accompanied by a similar 50% reduction in the ability of galectin-8 to induce osteoclastogenesis in co-culture experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results support the conclusion that galectin-8 functions as an osteoclastogenic agent through its action as an inducer of RANKL expression in osteoblasts."

Two proteins that specifically bound to the columns were of interest: LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grey et al., 2004</a>) and MRC2 (mannose receptor C, type 2) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Engelholm et al., 2009</a>). Both LRP1 and MRC2 could be detected by staining of proteins that selectively bound to immobilized GST-galectin-8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Because LRP1 and MRC2 form complexes with the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Behrendt, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gonias et al., 2011</a>), it was of interest to determine whether uPAR is also part of the proteins complex that binds galectin-8. Indeed, we could show by Western blotting that similar to LRP1 and MRC2, uPAR also selectively binds to immobilized galectin-8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

This was accompanied by a fourfold increase in the ratio of osteoclasts surface/bone perimeter in decalcified sections of tibia from the Tg animals (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B,C</a>) and a 40% increase in the abundance of active osteoclasts in culture (TRAP<sup>+</sup>, multinucleated cells) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>).

Still, the mechanisms underlying the development of this disease and some of the critical players in this process remain partially obscure (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bonucci and Ballanti, 2014</a>). In the present work, we provide evidence that an animal lectin of the galectin family regulates osteoclastogenesis and loss of bone mass. We show that galectin-8 increases the expression of RANKL, a key osteoclastogenic factor (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hanada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xiong and O'Brien, 2012</a>), in cultured osteoblasts, and promotes their osteoclastogenic potential when co-cultured with bone marrow cells. At the same time galectin-8 inhibits the expression of OPG, a neutralizing decoy receptor of RANKL, thus leading to an overall increase in the RANKL/OPG ratio. Given that RANKL is both necessary and sufficient for osteoclast differentiation, provided that permissive concentrations of MCSF are present (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eghbali-Fatourechi et al., 2003</a>), and given that galectin-8 does not affect the expression of MCSF, our findings strongly suggest that RANKL mediates the potentiating effects of galectin-8 on bone resorption."

Therefore, a number of cell types could serve as a source for the secreted galectin-8 that induces RANKL expression by osteoblasts. We have shown that silencing of galectin-8 expression in osteoblasts partially inhibits the expression of RANKL, suggesting that galectin-8, secreted from these cells, could act in an autocrine fashion to induce RANKL expression. However, we could also show that galectin-8 is present on the surface of bone marrow cells, turning these cells into additional potential source for galectin-8 that affects osteoblasts. Further studies will be required to resolve this complex issue."

                        "text": "At the molecular level, galectin-8 binds at the cell surface of osteoblasts to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grey et al., 2004</a>) and the mannose receptor C, type 2 (MRC2) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Engelholm et al., 2009</a>) that negatively and positively regulate galectin-8 function, respectively. LRP1 and MRC2 are part of a multi-protein complex that includes uPAR (<a href=\"#bib6\">Behrendt et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Smith and Marshall, 2010</a>). Indeed, we could demonstrate that uPAR co-precipitates with galectin-8 and that partial silencing the expression of uPAR attenuates the ability of galectin-8 to promote RANKL transcription; findings that conform with the observation that uPAR-deficient mice have increased bone mass (<a href=\"#bib26\">Furlan et al., 2007</a>). uPAR localizes to integrin-containing adhesion complexes, and co-immunoprecipitates with integrins and integrin-associated signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src family kinases (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib55\">Smith and Marshall, 2010</a>). In particular, it modulates the affinity of \u03b2<sub>1</sub>, \u03b2<sub>2</sub>, and \u03b2<sub>3</sub> integrins (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wei et al., 1996</a>) for their corresponding matrix ligands (<a href=\"#bib55\">Smith and Marshall, 2010</a>), and does it, in part, through binding to vitronectin (<a href=\"#bib55\">Smith and Marshall, 2010</a>). Integrins, including \u03b1<sub>1</sub>, \u03b1M, \u03b1<sub>3</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>, and \u03b1<sub>6</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>, as well as ECM proteins, also serve as binding partners to galectin-8 that functions as a matricellular protein (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hadari et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nishi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">C\u00e1rcamo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Troncoso et al., 2014</a>). Complex formation between galectin-8 and integrins triggers integrin-mediated signaling cascades such as Tyr phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, and a robust and sustained activation of the ERK and PI3K pathways (<a href=\"#bib37\">Levy et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2003</a>). Hence, interaction of galectin-8 with a complex of the uPAR/LRP1/MRC2 that binds integrins could be the mechanism underlying RANKL transcription in osteoblasts treated with this lectin. This model is further supported by the fact that integrins promote RANKL transcription through the activation of FAK in osteoblasts (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nakayamada et al., 2003</a>). Phosphorylated FAK activates several transduction molecules including Src and Grb2, which activate the ERK and PI3K signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schwartz and Ginsberg, 2002</a>). Indeed, activation of the ERK pathway in osteoblasts is obligatory for the action of galectin-8 as an inducer of osteoclastogenesis, implicating this signaling pathway as being the major pathway activated downstream of galectin-8. In contrast, the PI3K pathway appears not to play a role in the induction of RANKL in response to galectin-8, while having a partial role in mediating osteoclastogenesis. These findings place the PI3K pathway as acting downstream or independent of RANKL transcription in mediating the effects of galectin-8 on osteoclastogenesis."

LRP1, which also directly interacts with uPAR (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gonias et al., 2011</a>), could, for example, facilitate the endocytosis of uPAR, which was the first cell-signaling receptor identified as a member of the LRP1-regulated plasma membrane proteome (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gaultier et al., 2006</a>). Because LRP1 down-regulates cell-surface uPAR by facilitating its endocytosis, uPAR-initiated cell signaling may be inhibited by LRP1. Although galectin-8 can potentially bind to receptors that both negatively (LRP1) and positively (MRC2 and uPAR) regulate RANKL expression, the net effect is still an increase in RANKL expression and reduction in bone mass, which could be attributed, for example, to different expression levels of these receptors in osteoblasts. Alternatively, the duration of the signals emitted by these receptors could differ."

The increase in bone turnover could be attributed to the enhanced osteoclastogenic activity induced by galectin-8 that subsequently promotes osteoblasts differentiation and increased BFR (<a href=\"#bib25\">Feng and McDonald, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bonucci and Ballanti, 2014</a>).

The unique aspect of these observations stems from the fact that galectin-8, like other secreted animal lectins, binds cell-surface glycoconjugates that enable it to engage in binding to a number of receptors that express the proper repertoire of sugars on their surface. This offers a novel mean for spatially controlled regulation of bone remodeling through high-density information coding that involves lectin\u2013sugar interactions. Our findings place animal lectins, with galectin-8 as their representative, as novel osteoclastogenic agents and regulators of bone remodeling. The phenotype of gal-8 Tg mice, showing enhanced bone turnover and reduced bone mass, supports the conclusion that galectin-8 induces RANKL expression in an in vivo setting. The results reveal a potential link between galectins, LRP1, MRC2, and uPAR in mediating this process of osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, insights from this study might inform efforts to develop novel drug targets for the treatment of diseases associated with bone loss."

We have addressed this point in the Discussion (\u201cAlthough galectin-8 can potentially bind to receptors [\u2026] the signals emitted by these receptors could differ\u201d)."

Therefore, a number of cell types could serve as a source for the secreted galectin-8 that induces RANKL expression by osteoblasts. In experiments aimed to address this question we have now shown that silencing of galectin-8 expression in osteoblasts partially inhibits the expression of RANKL, suggesting that galectin-8, secreted from these cells, could act in an autocrine fashion to induce RANKL expression, along with other stimuli that promote expression of RANKL (new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Furthermore, we could show that galectin-8 is present on the surface of bone marrow cells, turning these cells as well into a potential source for secreted galectin-8 that affects osteoblasts (new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). These findings are also addressed in the Discussion (\u201cGalectins are secreted by atypical secretory pathway [\u2026] will be required to resolve this complex issue\u201d)."
