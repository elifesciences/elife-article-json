However, the molecular identity of the components of the MPTP remains unknown. Here, we determined that the Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak, which are central regulators of apoptotic cell death, are also required for mitochondrial pore-dependent necrotic cell death by facilitating outer membrane permeability of the MPTP. Loss of Bax/Bak reduced outer mitochondrial membrane permeability and conductance without altering inner membrane MPTP function, resulting in resistance to mitochondrial calcium overload and necrotic cell death. Reconstitution with mutants of Bax that cannot oligomerize and form apoptotic pores, but still enhance outer membrane permeability, permitted MPTP-dependent mitochondrial swelling and restored necrotic cell death. Our data predict that the MPTP is an inner membrane regulated process, although in the absence of Bax/Bak the outer membrane resists swelling and prevents organelle rupture to prevent cell death."

However, the molecular identity of the components of the MPTP remains unknown. Here, we determined that the Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak, which are central regulators of apoptotic cell death, are also required for mitochondrial pore-dependent necrotic cell death by facilitating outer membrane permeability of the MPTP. Loss of Bax/Bak reduced outer mitochondrial membrane permeability and conductance without altering inner membrane MPTP function, resulting in resistance to mitochondrial calcium overload and necrotic cell death. Reconstitution with mutants of Bax that cannot oligomerize and form apoptotic pores, but still enhance outer membrane permeability, permitted MPTP-dependent mitochondrial swelling and restored necrotic cell death. Our data predict that the MPTP is an inner membrane regulated process, although in the absence of Bax/Bak the outer membrane resists swelling and prevents organelle rupture to prevent cell death."

Apoptosis is both an ATP- and caspase-dependent event characterized by chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage, and plasma membrane blebbing (<a href=\"#bib7\">Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004</a>). Necrosis, however, is an ATP-independent event characterized by organelle swelling and early plasma membrane rupture (<a href=\"#bib7\">Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004</a>). One key difference between apoptosis and necrosis is the type of events that occur in the mitochondria and the distinct pores that are formed. During apoptosis, the mitochondrial outer membrane is permeabilized through the action of the Bcl-2 family members Bax/Bak that generate large pores that allow for the release of cytochrome <i>c</i> and the subsequent activation of the caspase cascade. In contrast, during forms of cellular necrosis, one key regulated event is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), a protein complex that was proposed to span the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes in facilitating loss of the inner membrane potential, swelling, and eventual rupture of the organelle (<a href=\"#bib15\">Halestrap, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tait and Green, 2010</a>). While the identity of the outer and inner membrane components of the MPTP remains elusive, cyclophilin D (CypD), a peptidylprolyl isomerase located in the mitochondrial matrix, is known to bind and regulate the inner membrane complex. Indeed, deletion of the gene encoding CypD renders mitochondria resistant to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload\u2013induced swelling and the heart and brain partially resistant to cell death due to ischemic injury (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baines et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nakagawa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schinzel et al., 2005</a>)."

Previous studies have suggested a role for Bax/Bak in the regulation or formation of the MPTP (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marzo et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Narita et al., 1998</a>), although more recent studies have disputed such a direct role, suggesting that Bax/Bak only have a secondary effect, such as by regulating mitochondrial fission/fusion or no effect whatsoever, or just a secondary effect due to organelle rupture (<a href=\"#bib9\">De Marchi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vaseva et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Whelan et al., 2012</a>). Here, we show that Bax/Bak are required for mitochondrial permeability pore-dependent cell death by serving as a necessary functional component of the MPTP within the outer mitochondrial membrane in a manner that is distinct from their more active mechanism of oligomerization during apoptosis, placing Bax/Bak at the bifurcation point of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and necrosis."

As previously reported, <i>Bax/Bak1</i> double-knockout (DKO) MEFs were highly resistant to cell death by the apoptotic inducer staurosporine (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wei et al., 2001</a>), while Wt MEFs showed high levels of killing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, DKO MEFs were also resistant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, ionomycin, and DNA alkylation with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) that appeared to induce a necrotic phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). Indeed, electron microscopy verified that staurosporine-treated Wt cells, but not DKO cells, exhibited hallmarks of apoptosis including nuclear condensation with maintenance of plasma membrane integrity, while ionomycin induced a purely necrotic phenotype that showed rupture of the plasma membrane and dispersion of the nucleus, which was not seen in DKO cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). By comparison, analysis of apoptotic cell death with annexin V (phosphatidylserine externalization in the plasma membrane) and necrotic death with propidium iodide (PI, plasma membrane opening/rupture) staining in cultured MEFs showed an apoptotic profile with staurosporine treatment, while ionomycin induced a necrotic phenotype; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> had an intermediate profile of both forms (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Apoptosis leads to annexin V staining prior to PI staining, while necrosis causes simultaneous annexin V and PI staining. Molecular markers also confirmed a uniform apoptotic profile in Wt MEFs treated with staurosporine, such that caspase cleavage was observed and cell death was inhibited with z-Vad (pan-caspase inhibitor) but not by disabling the MPTP in MEFs from <i>Ppif</i> (CypD)-null mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>). By comparison, ionomycin-induced cell death in Wt MEFs did not appreciably involve caspase activation nor was it affected by caspase inhibition, while inhibiting MPTP function by deletion of the <i>Ppif</i> gene\u2013reduced cell death, suggesting mitochondrial-dependent necrosis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>). Using these conditions, DKO MEFs were completely refractory to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>- and ionomycin-induced necrosis as assessed with annexin V and PI labeling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>; compare with <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), but all deaths were restored in DKO MEFs containing a stably integrated Bax or Bak viral\u2013based expression cassette, or acutely by infection with a recombinant Bax encoding adenovirus, collectively indicating that there is not an unrelated defect in the DKO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a>). Reconstitution with Bax and Bak produced an equal or slightly lower level of protein compared with endogenous protein content in Wt cells (data not shown)."

Necrosis more immediately extinguishes oxidative phosphorylation as the inner mitochondrial membrane is opened and the proton gradient is lost. Indeed, Wt MEFs treated with staurosporine maintained respiration considerably longer than observed with ionomycin treatment even though staurosporine-treated Wt MEFs died considerably faster than those with ionomycin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). However, DKO MEFs showed no reduction in oxygen consumption with ionomycin over 24 hr, providing yet another line of evidence that MPTP-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction does not occur in the absence of Bax/Bak protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). Other mitochondrial proteins involved in cell death, the MPTP, and respiration all appeared normal in DKO MEFs, except for a mild upregulation of Bim and Bnip3 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We also verified that ionomycin treated <i>Bax/Bak1</i> null MEFs still had functionally competent mitochondria as compared to ionomycin treated Wt MEFs by measuring respiration in response to oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin A. Both oligomycin (complex V inhibitor) and antimycin A (complex III inhibitor) inhibited oxygen consumption, suggesting that respiration observed was due to mitochondrial oxygen consumption as opposed to extra-mitochondrial sources. Further, treatment with FCCP increased respiration in the <i>Bax/Bak1</i> null but not in the Wt MEFs, suggesting that mitochondrial respiration was still coupled to ATP synthesis in ionomycin treated DKO cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, mitochondria from <i>Bax/Bak1</i> null MEFs were fully functional after ionomycin and responded to the drugs similar to untreated mitochondria, showing their ability to maintain respiration and generate ATP long after Wt mitochondria have lost such ability with ionomycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Finally, and consistent with results in DKO MEFs, cardiac-specific deletion of <i>Bax/Bak1</i> significantly protected the heart from ischemia\u2013reperfusion (I-R) injury and reduced lethality in mice subjected to permanent myocardial infarction injury (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that loss of Bax/Bak protein protects from ischemia-induced necrotic cell death in vivo due to a disease relevant stimuli."

Examination of this effect in purified mitochondria isolated from Wt MEFs showed swelling with acute Ca<sup>2+</sup> or atractyloside administration, which was blocked with cyclosporine (CsA), a CypD inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). However, purified mitochondria from DKO MEFs failed to show Ca<sup>2+</sup> or atractyloside-induced swelling under the same conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). This difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced swelling is even more pronounced in mitochondria freshly isolated from Wt or single <i>Bak1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mouse hearts or livers, which showed abundant swelling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F,H,I</a>). However, mitochondria purified from mouse hearts or livers of <i>Bak1/Bax-loxP</i> targeted mice subjected to heart- or liver-specific deletion with the appropriate Cre-expressing transgenes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 and 2</a>) were resistant to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced swelling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,J</a>). Consistent with these results, purified DKO MEF mitochondria continue to take-up exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> while mitochondria isolated from Wt MEFs show gradual inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at the 50- and 100-\u03bcM pulses, such that the MPTP opens and the mitochondria achieve equilibrium with the test solution at less cumulative Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K,L</a>). Direct inhibition of the MPTP with CsA enhanced Wt mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake because the MPTP remains closed through a higher range of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and by comparison, <i>Bax/Bak1</i> deficiency was also highly potent in allowing progressive Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake without engaging the MPTP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>). Indeed, mass spectrometry analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and other cations showed that basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> was enhanced in Bax/Bak-deficient mitochondria compared with Wt, and that with Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, Bax/Bak-deficient mitochondria maintained more of this ion beyond any additional effect with CsA (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Since MPTP formation has been proposed to function as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanism (<a href=\"#bib12\">Elrod et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bernardi and von Stockum, 2012</a>), the observed augmentation in baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Bax/Bak-deficient mitochondria, and their greater uptake capacity further suggest that Bax/Bak are required for MPTP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release."

Indeed, Bcl-2 family members are known to alter membrane characteristics and have channel-like activities of multiple conductance states (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antonsson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Minn et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Schlesinger et al., 1997</a>). Here, we examined the ability of two nonoligomerizing mutants of Bax (<a href=\"#bib14\">George et al., 2007</a>) to mediate cell death in the DKO MEF background. As a control, DKO MEFs reconstituted with a retrovirus expressing Wt Bax showed restoration of both staurosporine-mediated (apoptotic) and ionomycin-mediated (necrotic) killing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). However, restoration with either of the two mutants of Bax that cannot oligomerize, although both still localize to the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib14\">George et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>), restored ionomycin-induced killing but not apoptotic killing with staurosporine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). More importantly, purified mitochondria from these DKO MEFs reconstituted with Wt or the nonoligomerizing Bax mutants (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>) each showed partial restoration of MPTP function in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Specifically, purified mitochondria from DKO MEFs pulsed with 75 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> continued to show progressive Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, while mitochondria from Wt or the two nonoligomerizing Bax mutants each showed early saturation with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These results indicate that Bax can reconstitute MPTP function and permit nonapoptotic death in a nonoligomerized conformation, likely by affecting the permeability characteristics of the outer mitochondrial membrane."

This later observation is consistent with ultrastructual data discussed above in which the inner membrane can still reorganize without Bax/Bak in response to necrotic stimuli. Notably, purified mitochondria from Wt MEFs showed release of cytochrome <i>c</i> with ionomycin stimulation and loss of respiration with serial addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while mitochondria lacking Bax and Bak protein did not show cytochrome <i>c</i> release or loss of respiration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). These results suggest that the inner membrane component of the MPTP still functions normally in <i>Bax/Bak1</i> DKO MEFs, but without sufficient outer membrane permeability, swelling/rupture is prevented and the mitochondria can reestablish respiration capacity."

Purified liver DKO mitochondria stimulated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> were still protected from swelling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). However, treatment of DKO mitochondria with rBax at concentrations that did not cause cytochrome <i>c</i> release (data not shown) fully restored Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced mitochondrial swelling, which was still inhibited with CsA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Moreover, treatment with gossypol, a BH3-mimetic compound that can convert Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl into pore-forming pro-cell death agents (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lei et al., 2006</a>) restored mitochondrial swelling in the absence of Bax/Bak protein, which was also inhibited with CsA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Generation of nonspecific pores that only affected the outer mitochondrial membrane with either digitonin or tetanolysin also restored Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced swelling in DKO mitochondria, which was again inhibited with CsA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). These results suggest that Bax/Bak permit mitochondrial swelling through a permeabilization activity in the outer mitochondrial membrane that functions independently of the inner membrane CypD-regulated component of the MPTP. Indeed, increasing concentrations of poloxamer-188 (P-188), which inherently reduces membrane permeability characteristics (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wu et al., 2004</a>), prevented mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> as analyzed in purified mitochondria in solution or by transmission electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>).

The MPTP has been well characterized by direct patch-clamping of mitochondria and shown to have a specific conductance profile that is distinct from any other channels or permeating activities (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kinnally and Antonsson, 2007</a>). The data show baseline conductance of approximately 750 pS in Wt mitochondria, which was significantly reduced in DKO mitochondria to approximately 300 pS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>). Addition of the same non-oligomerizing rBax restored this baseline permeability and even enhanced it slightly (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>). This low-conductance channel activity with rBax was slightly cation selective but was not voltage dependent (\u00b150 mV) (data not shown). These results suggest that the presence of Bax/Bak impart a different permeability characteristic to the outer mitochondrial membrane that relates to its necessary but permissive role in MPTP function. Because Bax/Bak could be acting through another protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane to impart this increase in permeability, we also used a reconstitution assay in liposomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Remarkably, addition of monomeric rBax significantly increased the basal permeability of liposomes, but to a level, that was still more than 10\u00d7 less than when rBax was forced to oligomerize with recombinant tBid treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). The high resistance and low permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane with Bax/Bak deficiency reported here and previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2009</a>) suggest that this membrane is not a sieve but rather a membrane whose permeability is tightly regulated, despite the presence of other channels such as voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC, comprising as many as three gene products, <i>Vdac1</i>, <i>Vdac2</i>, and <i>Vdac3</i>) and TOM (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jonas et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2005</a>)."

We also examined this effect to determine if it might secondarily influence necrotic cell death in the DKO MEFs, or in purified mitochondria from these cells. Total intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were similar in DKO MEFs compared with Wt MEFs, as was ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels measured with two different agonists (thapsigargin or ATP), although total mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were significantly elevated in DKO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). It is uncertain why we failed to observe a decrease in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <i>Bak/Bak1</i> DKO MEFs, although our conditions were different from those previously reported, as we measured individual living cells in adherent cultures and used fivefold higher levels of thapsigargin. To unequivocally rule out a secondary effect due to lower levels of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> in DKO MEFs, we also used a recombinant adenovirus expressing the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase 1 (SERCA1) to load the ER with even more Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as previously shown (<a href=\"#bib41\">Scorrano et al., 2003</a>). However, AdSERCA1 infection neither restored cell death with ionomycin or staurosporine administration in DKO MEFs nor did it increase cell death in Wt MEFs, although it did load cells with significantly more Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and data not shown). Hence, we do not believe that DKO cells are resistant to mitochondrial pore-dependent cell death due to the previously reported mechanism of reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Indeed, the initial concept that increased Bcl-2 activity/expression decreases ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> load by increasing leak, thereby protecting from cell death, is controversial because a number of reports failed to observe any such decrease in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Distelhorst and Shore, 2004</a>)."

Over a decade ago, several reports suggested that Bax and/or Bak directly interacted with presumed components of the MPTP, the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) in the inner membrane and the VDAC in the outer membrane (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marzo et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Narita et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Shimizu et al., 1999</a>). However, while the mitochondrial swelling/permeability pore data reported in these earlier manuscripts are still valid, the conclusion that Bax/Bak function merely to regulate the MPTP by binding VDAC or ANT is not consistent with the data from <i>Slc25a4/Slc25a5</i> (ANT1/2 protein) and <i>Vdac1/2/3</i> gene\u2013deleted mice, which showed that neither protein is directly required for MPTP formation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kokoszka et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baines et al., 2007</a>)."

Bax has been shown to adopt two types of channel activities, one of which has a small pore size (0.9 nm) and is homogenous in the outer mitochondrial membrane, which could fulfill the permeability function we observed here to permit nonapoptotic cell death (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lin et al., 2011</a>). As another consideration, the \u03b15/\u03b16 domain of Bax is known to have membrane permeation activity and to permit pore formation on its own, the permeation size of which appears to reach an equilibrium of less than 10 kDa (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fuertes et al., 2010</a>). Bcl-2 family members appear to generally alter the permeability and rigidity of lipid membranes, and even the Bcl-2 homologue from <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, CED-9 can induce leakiness of reconstituted lipid membranes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tan et al., 2011</a>). The exact mechanism whereby Bcl-2 family members might increase membrane permeability and small molecular permeation in their nonoligomerized state is unknown, although it may be related to the distinct lipid environment in the mitochondria and how it interacts with the select hydrophobic \u03b1-helixes in the core of the Bcl-2 proteins."

Once the inner membrane pore opens through a CypD-regulated event, the outer membrane is already poised to complete the process, given the permeability characteristics imparted by Bax/Bak in their monomeric states (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Indeed, liposome reconstitution with recombinant nonactivated Bax directly increased membrane permeability, and rBax immediately restored swelling in isolated mitochondria. Moreover, increasing the activity of Bax/Bak with ABT-737 sensitized the MPTP to opening with mild Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation in Wt but not DKO mitochondria, and nonspecific increases in outer mitochondrial membrane permeability with gossypol or other agents fully restored mitochondrial swelling and cell death in the absence of Bax/Bak. Direct patching of mitochondria outer vs inner membranes showed that Bax/Bak permit MPTP-dependent mitochondrial swelling by only enhancing conductance of the outer membrane. Our results also suggest that the outer mitochondrial membrane does not directly induce the inner membrane to undergo MPTP, and that initiation of this process is an inner membrane-regulated phenomenon (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). However, lack of sufficient outer membrane permeability, as observed in the absence of Bax/Bak protein or with addition of poloxamer-188 in Wt mitochondria, sufficiently restrains swelling and organelle rupture to allow reestablishment of inner membrane potential and continued cell survival. Thus, Bax and Bak are necessary for MPTP-dependent cell death by functioning exclusively within the outer membrane as permeability factors that facilitate an irreversible swelling threshold leading to rupture of the mitochondrion and cell death, once the inner membrane component is fully engaged."

Indeed, ABT-737 treatment increased cellular necrosis, mitochondrial swelling, and enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in isolated mitochondria by augmenting the amount/activity of Bax/Bak in the outer mitochondrial membrane. While we cannot rule out other potential mechanisms of action for ABT-737, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that acute alterations in the activity of select Bcl-2 family members could affect cellular necrosis by acutely regulating the activity, localization, or function of Bax/Bak. Indeed, Nix/BNip3L, which is induced by disease/developmental signaling pathways that enhance cell death, can alter the activity and pro-death characteristics of Bax/Bak as well as alter MPTP-dependent cell death (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2010</a>)."

Thus, inhibition of Bax/Bak should be the most therapeutically potent means of antagonizing acute cell death following ischemic injury in vivo or in adult onset degenerative diseases, as it would block both mitochondrial-dependent processes. Moreover, other types of regulated necrotic cell death might also be inhibited in the absence of Bax/Bak, such as necroptosis, also referred to as extrinsic necrosis or RIP-dependent necrosis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Degterev et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hitomi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, we and others have observed that <i>Bax/Bak1</i> null MEFs were resistant to this form of cell death (data not shown and <a href=\"#bib19\">Irrinki et al., 2011</a>). Necroptosis is induced in cells when stimulated with tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) in the presence of caspase inhibitors, such as zVAD-fmk (<a href=\"#bib8\">Degterev et al., 2005</a>). Necroptosis is inhibited with by necrostatins, a series of serine\u2013theronine kinase inhibitors that were later shown to block RIP1 kinase in preventing TNF\u03b1- and ZVAD-dependent necroptosis in culture. RIP1 is able to interact with RIP3 in controlling necroptosis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cho et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">He et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Recently, mixed lineage kinase domain\u2013like protein (MLKL) and phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5) were shown to be downstream of the RIP proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Knockdown of either MLKL or PGAM5 resulted in protection against RIP-mediated necroptosis, as well as protection against ROS or Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload\u2013mediated necrosis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). This duality led the authors to recognize the existence of two arms of the necrotic pathway, the extrinsic arm (TNF + zVAD\u2013induced necrosis) and the intrinsic arm that responds to ROS or Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload\u2013induced necrosis, which is the form of necrosis that we investigated here as affected by Bax/Bak (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2012</a>)."

The cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with FITC-labeled secondary antibody for 30 min, washed, and resuspended in PBS and analyzed with a flow cytometer (10,000/sample). Activation of Bak was determined by cross-linking isolated mitochondria (50 \u03bcg) from cells treated with 10 mM disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) at room temperature for 30 min. The mitochondria were then suspended in SDS sample buffer, and a Western blot was performed. Wt MEFs were treated with or without St and Iono for 12 hr in the presence of 40 \u03bcM z-Vad. After 12 hr, they were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in HNC buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 2% CHAPS). The lysates were loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE, Pittsburgh, PA). The column was pre-equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM DTT, and 2% CHAPS and calibrated with ferritin (440 kDa), B amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome <i>c</i> (12 kDa; Sigma). The proteins were collected in 0.6 ml fractions every minute. The fractions were then subjected to TCA precipitation to concentrate the protein before Western blotting."

Membrane patches of isolated mitochondria were excised after formation of a seal using micropipettes with approximately 0.3-\u00b5m tips and resistances of 10\u201330 M\u03a9 at room temperature. Patching media was 150 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 0.23 mM CaCl<sub>2,</sub> 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4. Voltages were clamped with an Axopatch 200 amplifier and reported as pipette potentials. Permeability was typically determined from stable current levels and/or total amplitude histograms of 30 s of data at +20 mV. pClamp version 8 (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) and WinEDR v2.3.3 (Strathclyde Electrophysiological Software, Glasgow, UK) were used for current analysis as previously described (<a href=\"#bib29\">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2009</a>). Sample rate was 5 kHz with 1\u20132 kHz filtration. The channel activity of rBax was characterized in DKO mitochondria and liposomes devoid of other proteins with and without its activator tBid. Micropipette tips were filled with media containing 10\u2013100 ng/\u00b5l monomeric rBax and then backfilled with patching media. Hence, the actual Bax concentration was lower than that loaded in the tips. Seals were formed with these micropipettes on giant liposomes or mitochondria prepared as described previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2009</a>). Ion selectivity was determined through reversal potentials after a 150:30 mM KCl gradient was established across the patch as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pavlov et al., 2001</a>)."

The data suggest that Bax/Bak null mitochondria resist swelling, and they are interpreted within a model \u201cwhereby Bax and/or Bak are part of the outer membrane component of the MPTP in a \u2018resting\u2019 non-apoptotic state\u201d. Yet the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) is an inner membrane event that readily occurs in mitoplasts. The link with MPTP-dependent swelling is therefore an interpretation that must be confirmed by additional experiments. The proposed experiments will address whether Bax/Bak affect outer membrane resistance to rupture only when the MPTP opens or independent of the mechanism of matrix swelling."

This would also allow testing to determine whether resistance to swelling is specifically seen when the pore opens, or is rather an independent feature conferred to the outer membrane by lack of Bax/Bak."

If the Bax/Bak null mitochondria are resistant to alamethicin this would already indicate that lack of swelling is not specifically related to the permeability transition; if they do swell this would make for an important internal calibration allowing a comparison with the wild type genotype."

To address this issue we isolated both wild type and Bax/Bak deficient mitochondria from MEFs and livers. These mitochondria were subjected to varying concentrations of KCl. Wild type and Bax/Bak null mitochondria responded equally to the varying concentrations of KCl as now seen in the newly added <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C,D</a> (MEFs) &amp; G,H (livers). These new data further strengthen our hypothesis that Bax and Bak are required specifically for MPTP dependent mitochondrial swelling and not non-specific mitochondrial swelling induced by osmotic changes."

However, in the past we normalized such values because the initial absorbance can slightly vary from preparation to preparation, although independent of genotype (it is a variable of such purification preparations). Hence, while initial absorbance varies slightly between preparations, the response of the mitochondria in each preparation is the important value and this is always consistent, similar to normalized data. In all of our swelling experiments we have never observed a significant difference in the starting point between any of our genotypes (hence the subtle variation in starting swollen state is an independent variable that does not track with any genotype)."

These data were collected from both purified mitochondria isolated from MEFs and livers that are control or Bax/Bak deficient. In both mitochondria, calcium induced swelling does not occur when Bax and Bak are absent, but the addition of alamethicin confirms that these mitochondria have an equal maximal swelling potential when compared to the wild type control. Taken together, the results from the newly added <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> reinforces our original hypothesis."
