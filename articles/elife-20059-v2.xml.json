MEF2C is highly expressed in developing cortical excitatory neurons, but its role in their development remains unclear. We show here that conditional embryonic deletion of <i>Mef2c</i> in cortical and hippocampal excitatory neurons (Emx1-lineage) produces a dramatic reduction in cortical network activity in vivo, due in part to a dramatic increase in inhibitory and a decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission. In addition, we find that MEF2C regulates E/I synapse density predominantly as a cell-autonomous, transcriptional repressor. Analysis of differential gene expression in <i>Mef2c</i> mutant cortex identified a significant overlap with numerous synapse- and autism-linked genes, and the <i>Mef2c</i> mutant mice displayed numerous behaviors reminiscent of autism, ID and SCZ, suggesting that perturbing MEF2C function in neocortex can produce autistic- and ID-like behaviors in mice."

MEF2C is highly expressed in developing cortical excitatory neurons, but its role in their development remains unclear. We show here that conditional embryonic deletion of <i>Mef2c</i> in cortical and hippocampal excitatory neurons (Emx1-lineage) produces a dramatic reduction in cortical network activity in vivo, due in part to a dramatic increase in inhibitory and a decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission. In addition, we find that MEF2C regulates E/I synapse density predominantly as a cell-autonomous, transcriptional repressor. Analysis of differential gene expression in <i>Mef2c</i> mutant cortex identified a significant overlap with numerous synapse- and autism-linked genes, and the <i>Mef2c</i> mutant mice displayed numerous behaviors reminiscent of autism, ID and SCZ, suggesting that perturbing MEF2C function in neocortex can produce autistic- and ID-like behaviors in mice."

As the brain develops, neurons establish connections with one another called synapses, which are either excitatory or inhibitory. At excitatory synapses, an electrical signal in the first cell increases the likelihood that the second cell will also produce an electrical signal. At inhibitory synapses, electrical activity in the first cell reduces the chances of the second cell producing an electrical signal. An imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory activity is one of the factors thought to give rise to neurodevelopmental disorders."

These included a loss of interest in social interaction and a reduction in vocalizations, suggesting impaired communication. Other behavioral changes included hyperactivity, repetitive movements and severe learning impairments: all features commonly observed in human neurodevelopmental disorders."

Recent genetic studies have linked human <i>MEF2C</i> to a syndromic form of intellectual disability with autistic features, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near <i>MEF2C</i> produce significant risk for SCZ (<a href=\"#bib47\">Paciorkowski et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mikhail et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Novara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Le Meur et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cardoso et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Engels et al., 2009</a>), which highlight the importance of this gene for normal brain development and function. However, the functional role(s) of MEF2C in early neuronal development, particularly in the neocortex, remains unclear. In the central nervous system, MEF2C is highly expressed very early in brain development (~E11.5), and its expression is enriched in differentiated forebrain neurons within the neocortex and dentate gyrus (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lyons et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Leifer et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">1997</a>).

Therefore, we sought to test whether loss of <i>Mef2c</i> in the cortex alters cortical synaptic transmission in vivo. To achieve this, we measured cortical UP states, which are spontaneous, synchronous oscillations of neocortical networks that are driven by recurrent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic circuitry (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hays et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gibson et al., 2008</a>), to assess overall synaptic function and excitability of the neocortical circuit within the somatosensory cortex (SSC) of the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice. Surprisingly, we observed large reductions (~90%) in the frequency of spontaneous UP states in acute slices from the SSC of <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In addition, the UP states in the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice were shorter in duration (~50%) and smaller in amplitude (~50%) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To further explore this decrease in neocortical circuit activity, we performed patch-clamp recordings of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from the SSC acute slices. In the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO slices, we detected small decreases in both the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), although the decrease in frequency did not quite reach statistical significance (p=0.07). We also observed large increases in both the frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Together, these findings indicate that the embryonic loss of MEF2C in cortical excitatory neurons results in a small decrease in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and a large increase in inhibitory synaptic transmission \u2013 the combination of which likely contributes to the dramatic reduction in cortical network activity as detected by spontaneous UP states."

In this way, &gt;99% of the presynaptic inputs onto the transfected neurons are wild-type, so noted changes in the synapse density onto Cre-expressing neurons are likely postsynaptic cell-dependent functions for MEF2C. Using this approach, we observe that Cre-expressing cortical pyramidal neurons displayed a significant increase in GABAergic synapse density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and a significant decrease in dendritic spine density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), similar to the direction and magnitude of E/I synapse changes observed in the global <i>Mef2c</i> cKO neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Interestingly, we did not observe any significant changes in GABAergic synapse density onto GAD65-positive <i>Mef2c<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> interneurons transfected with Cre (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), suggesting the increase in inhibitory synapses is specific to excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons."

As such, we considered the possibility that MEF2C-VP16 and MEF2C loss-of-function could both produce excitatory synapse reductions if endogenous MEF2C is functioning as a transcriptional repressor on key target genes that regulate synapse density. Consistent with this basic idea, we found that overexpression of MEF2C-VP16, a constitutively-active form of MEF2C (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), in wild-type cortical pyramidal neurons significantly reduced dendritic spine density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), whereas a dominant-repressor form of MEF2C (MEF2C-EN) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>) failed to alter dendritic spine density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). However, cell-autonomous expression of MEF2C-EN in <i>Mef2c</i> cKO neurons rescued the decrease in dendritic spine density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), strongly suggesting that endogenous MEF2C functions as a transcriptional repressor to regulate dendritic spine density. In wild-type cortical pyramidal neurons, MEF2C-VP16 also significantly increased GABAergic synapse density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), whereas MEF2C-EN had no effect on GABAergic synapse density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>). Similar to the dendritic spine density findings, cell-autonomous expression of MEF2C-EN rescued the increase in GABAergic synapse density observed in the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO cortical pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). These results suggest that endogenous MEF2C functions predominantly as a transcriptional repressor to inhibit target genes that promote excitatory synapse elimination and inhibitory synapse formation and/or stability."

In the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO DEGs, we identified a significant overrepresentation of ASD-risk genes (p=0.0007, hypergeometric test, perm=0.001) and synapse-linked genes (p=0.0004, hypergeometric test, perm=0.001), (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), including the autism-linked genes <i>Ntng1, Nlgn1, Nrxn1, Nrxn3, Pcdh19, Shank2, Shank3, Pten</i> and <i>Htr1b.</i> We also detected a significant enrichment for FMRP-associated RNAs (p=3x10<sup>\u221207</sup>, hypergeometric test, perm=0.001), which is interesting since FMRP is required for MEF2C-VP16-induced excitatory synapse elimination (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</a>). Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we validated dysregulation of several <i>Mef2c</i> cKO DEGs in both postnatal day 21 (P21) and adult SSC tissue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Interestingly, there were several dysregulated genes that are reported to regulate inhibitory GABAergic transmission (<i>Gabra5</i> and <i>Nos1</i>), and we observed a significant increase in <i>Pcdh10</i> mRNA, a factor we previously implicated in MEF2/FMRP-dependent glutamatergic synapse elimination (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tsai et al., 2012</a>). Overall, our RNAseq data analysis suggests that MEF2C, either directly or indirectly, influences a large, complex gene expression program that influences neuronal and synapse development, and numerous syndromic and idiopathic autism-linked genes."

In humans, impairments in communication and social interactions are common symptom domains of autism and SCZ. <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice displayed dramatic abnormalities in a putative form of oral social communication in mice \u2013 ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) produced by a young adult male mouse when placed in the presence of a female in estrous or upon young pup separation from its mother (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hanson and Hurley, 2012</a>). In the presence of a sexually-receptive female, <i>Mef2c</i> cKO males generated far fewer USV calls (~70% reduction, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and showed a significant increase in the latency to the first call (~3-fold, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Wild-type littermate mice produced a range of distinct simple and complex stereotyped USV call subtypes (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ey et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice produced a ~5-fold increase in unstructured USVs, and a corresponding decrease in complex, but not simple, USVs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While many basic USV parameters were unchanged by genotype (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>), we detected significant reductions in the maximum USV frequency and the mean frequency at the end of calls (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013H</a>). Similar to the adults, <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice at postnatal days 4\u201310 produced significantly fewer USVs upon separation from the mother (distress calls) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), but at this age, the USV structures, subtypes and basic call parameters were indistinguishable from WT littermates (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1I\u2013J</a>). Together these data indicate that <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice produce significantly fewer USVs in a species-specific form of putative oral communication."

Consistent with these ex vivo acute slice recordings, cultured <i>Mef2c</i> cKO cortical neurons displayed a significant decrease in dendritic spine density and an increase in GABAergic synapse density. Our functional rescue findings suggest that MEF2C in cortical pyramidal neurons regulates E/I synapse densities in early development by acting in the postsynaptic neuron as a cell-autonomous, transcriptional repressor on key target genes. Loss of MEF2C alters the gene expression, directly or indirectly, of numerous autism- and synapse-linked genes and RNAs known to associate with FMRP, the leading genetic cause of ID and autism. These findings position MEF2C as a critical transcriptional regulator functioning at the nexus of numerous synapse- and neurodevelopmental disorder-linked genes. Finally, the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice display multiple behavioral phenotypes that are reminiscent of core autism symptoms in humans, including abnormal social behaviors, reduced USVs in multiple ages and contexts, and an increased frequency of some repetitive motor behaviors. We also observed learning and memory deficits and motor hyperactivity, which are common associated symptoms of ASDs and observed in patients with <i>MEF2C</i> mutations. Taken together, our findings suggest that the loss of MEF2C\u2019s repressor function in cortical excitatory neurons produces an E/I synapse imbalance and that this synaptic phenotype might contribute to the numerous, neurodevelopmental disorder-related behavioral phenotypes observed in the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice."

However, similar to a previous report (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2008</a>), we found that loss of MEF2C produced a <i>decrease</i> in cortical excitatory synaptic transmission, suggesting that MEF2C is a positive regulator of excitatory synapses in cortical neurons. However, overexpression of MEF2C-VP16, a strong, constitutive transcriptional activator form of MEF2C, in wild-type cortical neurons also decreased dendritic spine density and increased inhibitory synapse density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,H</a>) \u2013 essentially phenocopying the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO neurons. In contrast, overexpression of MEF2C-EN, a dominant repressor form of MEF2C, in WT neurons had no effect on dendritic spines or GABAergic synapse densities; whereas, expression of MEF2C-EN in <i>Mef2c</i> cKO cortical pyramidal neurons normalized excitatory and inhibitory synapse densities to WT levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,I</a>). Together, these findings suggest that endogenous MEF2C functions as a cell-autonomous, transcriptional repressor at one or more key target genes involved in excitatory synapse elimination and GABAergic synapse formation/stability. These observations are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that MEF2A can also function as a transcriptional repressor to promote cerebellar excitatory synapse maturation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shalizi et al., 2006</a>), highlighting a critical role for diverse mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by MEF2 family members to regulate synapse development in the brain. It\u2019s interesting to note that membrane depolarization of <i>Mef2c</i> cKO cortical neurons stimulated MEF2 reporter gene activity levels that are comparable to responses in WT littermates, suggesting that the activity-dependent induction of MEF2-sensitive target genes can be fully compensated for by endogenous MEF2A and MEF2D. In the future, it will be important to study the overlapping and potentially distinct functions of the various MEF2 family members, and their activity-dependent regulation, in cortical neuron function and development."

In the future, cell autonomous manipulations of the DG neurons will be important to resolve this question. Also, postnatal <i>Mef2c</i> deletion in forebrain excitatory neurons did not produce social or repetitive behavioral phenotypes, despite the increase in DG dendritic spine density (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adachi et al., 2016</a>), suggesting a dissociation of hippocampal DG spine density and postnatal MEF2C deletion from several ASD-related behaviors. As such, the role(s) for MEF2C in embryonic and/or early postnatal cortical development might be more critical for producing the behavioral phenotypes observed in our <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice. Finally, while we observe significant synaptic and gene expression differences in the SSC of the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice, Emx1-Cre expression is also detected in other brain regions and cell types, including the olfactory bulb and some glia, and as such, it is not possible to attribute the behavioral phenotypes observed in the <i>Mef2c</i> cKO mice to the synaptic changes in the SSC, and future studies that further dissect the Emx1-lineage populations will be necessary to link specific <i>Mef2c</i> cKO behavioral phenotypes with a specific brain region(s)."

For each neuron, the threshold for GFP, GAD65 and GABAR\u03b32 was determined from the sum of the average pixel intensity and standard deviation for each independent neuron. This thresholding method was then consistently applied across all images within the experiment. A binary mask including all pixels above the threshold was created for all channels for each image and the 'Analyze particles' function was used to determine regions of triple co-localization at least one pixel in size. To calculate synapse density, this number was divided by the area of the neuron as measured using the GFP mask minus the cell body (for dendritic synapse density) or using the GFP mask of only the cell body (for soma synapse density). Approximately 5\u201320 images from 2\u20133 separate coverslips were acquired and analyzed for each condition within an experiment for a total of at least two experiments. Synapse density values within each experiment were normalized to account for the variation in antibody staining and neuronal density from experiment to experiment. Within an experiment, the average synapse density value was obtained for the control and for experimental conditions. The normalized value of each experiment is the average experimental value divided by the average control value. For experiments involving quantification of inhibitory synapse density onto interneurons specifically, the observation of GAD65 expression in the cell body was used to identify and distinguish these interneurons from other excitatory cell types. Statistical significance was determined by t-test by using GraphPad Prism (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798\">SCR_002798</a>). Error bars denote standard error."

Spontaneously-generated UP-states were extracellularly recorded from layer 4 (L4) of the primary somatosensory cortex for 10 min using 0.5 M\u03a9 tungsten microelectrodes, amplified 10,000-fold, sampled at 2.5 kHz, and filtered between 300\u2009Hz and 5 kHz. All measurements were analyzed using custom Labview software. The beginning of an UP-state was defined as events in which the amplitude remained above threshold for at least 100 ms. The end of the UP-state was determined after the event amplitude decreased below threshold for &gt;600 ms. Two events within 600 msec were defined as a single UP-state. All of the 20 slices prepared from MEF2C<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice displayed UP states, whereas only 9 of 18 slices from MEF2C<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Cre<sup>Emx1</sup> mice displayed UP states during a 10 min recording session, perhaps reflecting the reduced excitability of the MEF2C<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Cre<sup>Emx1</sup> circuits. Therefore, UP state duration and amplitude was only measured in the 9 slices that expressed UP states."
