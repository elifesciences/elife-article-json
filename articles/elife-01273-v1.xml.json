However, research has largely focused on sensory deprivation and maladaptive change. Here we show that adaptive patterns of limb usage after amputation drive cortical plasticity. We report that individuals with congenital or acquired limb-absence vary in whether they preferentially use their intact hand or residual arm in daily activities. Using fMRI, we show that the deprived sensorimotor cortex is employed by whichever limb individuals are over-using. Individuals from <i>either</i> group that rely more on their intact hands (and report less frequent residual arm usage) showed increased intact hand representation in the deprived cortex, and increased white matter fractional anisotropy underlying the deprived cortex, irrespective of the age at which deprivation occurred. Our results demonstrate how experience-driven plasticity in the human brain can transcend boundaries that have been thought to limit reorganisation after sensory deprivation in adults."

However, research has largely focused on sensory deprivation and maladaptive change. Here we show that adaptive patterns of limb usage after amputation drive cortical plasticity. We report that individuals with congenital or acquired limb-absence vary in whether they preferentially use their intact hand or residual arm in daily activities. Using fMRI, we show that the deprived sensorimotor cortex is employed by whichever limb individuals are over-using. Individuals from <i>either</i> group that rely more on their intact hands (and report less frequent residual arm usage) showed increased intact hand representation in the deprived cortex, and increased white matter fractional anisotropy underlying the deprived cortex, irrespective of the age at which deprivation occurred. Our results demonstrate how experience-driven plasticity in the human brain can transcend boundaries that have been thought to limit reorganisation after sensory deprivation in adults."

Nevertheless, individuals can employ a variety of behavioural strategies to adapt to the loss of, say, a hand. Some become skilled at using the residual part of their arm, while others prefer to rely on their other hand. Their brain, too, will undergo major changes. Many studies have shown that the region of the brain that controlled a given limb can be \u201ctaken over\u201d by another part of the body if that limb is lost. This process has been previously considered to be harmful, as it has been linked to experiences of pain arising from the missing limb."

People who had been born without a hand or who had lost a hand in later life were asked to wear a device that recorded their movements as they went about their daily lives. The data revealed that people who had been born without a hand made relatively more use of their residual limb, while those who had lost their hand made relatively more use of their remaining hand."

In the subjects born without a hand (who were making relatively extensive use of their residual limb), the area of the brain that would otherwise control the \u2018missing\u2019 hand was activated when the subjects moved their residual limb. And in the subjects who had lost their hand, this brain region was activated when they moved their remaining hand. However, in individual subjects, the size of the effect depended on the usage preferences of the subject: for example, the minority of people who were born without a hand but nevertheless make extensive use of their intact hand showed a pattern of activation that resembled the average pattern seen in those who had lost a hand in later life."

Arm-amputation is a particularly powerful model for studying plasticity as it combines two major drivers for reorganisation \u2013 sensory deprivation and adaptive motor behaviour. Despite this, most accounts of plasticity following arm amputation focused on sensory deprivation, and in particular on apparently passive remapping of adjacent face or arm representation into the deprived cortex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lotze et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ramachandran and Altschuler, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Nava and R\u00f6der, 2011</a>). Although longer-range remapping has also been reported, such as intact hand representation in the deprived cortex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bogdanov et al., 2012</a>), this is usually also explained as a passive result of inter-hemispheric dis-inhibition (<a href=\"#bib34\">Werhahn et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ramachandran and Altschuler, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Sim\u00f5es et al., 2012</a>). However, these accounts ignore substantial adaptations in motor behaviour that accompany absence or loss of a limb, which could be powerful drivers for plasticity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Scholz et al., 2009</a>)."

A further aim was to investigate whether functional cortical reorganisation underlies any observed variation in motor behaviour.

Specifically, we quantified the extent to which individuals utilise their residual arms, relative to their intact hands (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), in daily activities. We collected data from acceleration monitors, worn by a sub-set of 20 participants (8 congenital) while engaged in their normal routines. A laterality index, reflecting the relative number of movements performed by the intact hand vs the residual arm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), showed that both groups moved the intact hand more than the residual arm (t(7) = 3.48, p=0.01; t(11) = 10.60, p=0.001, one-sample t-test compared to zero for the congenital and acquired groups, respectively). This could be due both to greater use of the intact hand and also to the different position of the accelerometer on the two sides of the body (wrist vs arm), resulting in different acceleration profiles. Our main aim was to compare the degree of this laterality across the two 1-handed groups. We found that the acquired group exhibited stronger relative reliance on their intact hand, as demonstrated in a significantly greater lateralisation scores towards the intact hand, compared to the congenital group (t(18) = \u22122.67, p=0.016, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

This suggests that the area that would typically represent the missing hand has been recruited to support increased representation of the residual arm or intact hand. To investigate use-dependent plasticity specifically in the \u2018deprived cortex\u2019, we constructed an independent region of interest (ROI), based on the conjunction between phantom/nondominant hand movements in acquired amputees/2-handed controls. Amputees often experience vivid sensations of a phantom hand. Recently, this phenomenology has been supported by empirical evidence demonstrating that movements of a phantom limb elicit both central and peripheral motor signals that are different from those found during imagined movement (<a href=\"#bib24\">Reilly et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Raffin et al., 2012</a>). This phenomenon of maintained representation in the sensorimotor cortex, allowed us to reliably localise the representation of the missing hand (<a href=\"#bib17\">Makin et al., 2013</a>). Here, this pre-defined ROI was used to interrogate activity relating to other body parts, thus allowing us to test the usage-driven hypotheses independently. The borders of this \u2018deprived cortex\u2019 ROI, spanning primary somatosensory and motor cortices, are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. As the spatial resolution and co-registration methods used here are insufficient to reliably dissociate the somatosensory and motor primary cortices, cortical areas spanning the pre- and post-central gyri will be described here as \u2018sensorimotor\u2019."

Using physiological measurements, we provide the first detailed description of patterns of daily limb usage in individuals with congenital and acquired limb-loss. Next, using fMRI we show that representation patterns in the deprived cortex of 1-handed individuals are contingent upon the limb-use strategy adopted by individuals, rather than a sensitive period in development: Individuals from either 1-handed group that rely more on their intact hands showed increased representation of the (ipsilateral) intact hand in the deprived cortex, irrespective of age at deprivation.

As a result of limb loss, 69% of sufferers have to change job or become unemployed (<a href=\"#bib8\">Jang et al., 2011</a>). How best to rehabilitate these individuals, and allow them to return to active and productive lifestyles, is unknown (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nimhurchadha et al., 2013</a>). While tremendous resources are dedicated to aiding 1-handed populations through the development of sophisticated prosthetic limbs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kuiken et al., 2009</a>), a relatively large number of the individuals do not use them and prefer to carry out daily activities with their intact hand (<a href=\"#bib8\">Jang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">\u00d8stlie et al., 2012</a>). Clinicians are aware that different individuals adapt to limblessness in varying ways\u2013with some relying on the intact limb (<a href=\"#bib10\">Jones and Davidson, 1999</a>) and others showing remarkable ability with their residual limb or a prosthetic limb (<a href=\"#bib30\">Smurr et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Jang et al., 2011</a>). Surprisingly, however, to our knowledge there has been no previous empirical study of the range of adaptive motor behaviours taken in 1-handed individuals in their natural environment (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lindner et al., 2010</a>). Based on subjective (questionnaires) and objective (accelerometry) usage monitoring, we provide empirical data on patterns of limb usage in these groups while engaged in their natural routine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and then show that these daily usage strategies are a powerful driver of plasticity in the deprived cortex."

This is consistent with previous reports of reorganisation associated with compensatory foot-use in individuals with bilateral congenital upper limb malformation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Stoeckel et al., 2009</a>). Conversely, the 1-handed individuals with acquired amputation, who are more dependent on their intact hands for daily activities, show strong activation in their deprived cortex when the intact hand is moving (<a href=\"#fig2 fig3 fig4\">Figures 2C, 3C, 4</a>). However, this dissociative representation doesn\u2019t exclusively rely on the cause of or age at deprivation: increased ipsilateral intact hand representation was associated with the usage strategy adopted by individuals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), such that people who have learned to incorporate their residual arms in daily tasks tended to show reduced intact hand representation in the deprived cortex."

For example, using an ROI analysis, we have identified similar patterns of limb over-representation in the deprived cerebellum, which were not apparent in the (corrected) whole-brain comparison. We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that habitual usage strategies could produce further changes in brain representation, beyond the deprived cortex and even the sensorimotor system. Further research is therefore necessary in order to determine the full extent of adaptive plasticity following limb-loss."

The structural differences in the corticospinal tract, associated with increased representation of the intact hand in the deprived cortex, may shed new light on the origin of bimanual plasticity in amputees, which has previously been regarded as a consequence of reduced inter-hemispheric inhibition (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sim\u00f5es et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, we find similar results in the deprived cerebellum, as identified in the sensorimotor cortex, despite fundamental differences in body-part topography (<a href=\"#bib26\">Shambes et al., 1978</a>) in these two brain regions. One tentative interpretation of these findings is that longer-range plasticity (where the deprived cortex is recruited by the intact hand) elicits structural white matter change, whereas more local plasticity (where the deprived cortex is recruited by the residual arm) does not. However, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow us to differentiate between experience-dependent and pre-existing variations in white matter structure that might confer a bias towards intact hand representation in the deprived cortex."

We show that the deprived cortex in people with either congenital or acquired hand absence is employed by whichever part of the upper limb individuals are relatively over-using (compared to other 1-handed individuals) to compensate for their disability. This occurs irrespective of whether this is a hand or an arm and the degree to which it is typically represented in the deprived brain area. By demonstrating that adaptive plasticity in amputees transcends the boundaries thought to restrict reorganisation after sensory deprivation in the adult human brain, our results may inspire future research, aimed at utilising neurorehabilitation to improve usage of both residual and intact arms, as well as artificial arms, in 1-handed individuals of all ages."

Data from one acquired participant was discarded, due to hardware malfunction. Data for each of the three movement axes was initially smoothed using a 500 ms kernel, to discard high frequency noise. To quantify the number of movements executed with each limb, the difference between maximal and minimal acceleration values were initially calculated within a sliding window of 400 ms for each movement axis separately. In each time window, movements were identified as difference in acceleration that was above a threshold of 0.2 m/s<sup>2</sup> in at least one axis, provided that this increase was preceded and followed by periods of no movement (a difference between maximal and minimal acceleration below 0.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>) in all axes. To account for whole body movements, as well as differences in number of hours of recordings, a ratio between the two limb movements was used, rather than an absolute number of movements. The movement laterality ratio was chosen [(intact\u2212residual)/(intact+residual)], as it portrays the extent of intact hand usage, given the contribution of residual arm movements."

TBSS projects all subjects\u2019 FA data onto a mean FA tract skeleton, before applying voxelwise cross-subject statistics. Diffusion data were initially corrected for eddy-currents and head motion using affine registration to the average of the non-diffusion-weighted volumes. A diffusion tensor model was fitted at every voxel to derive FA maps, which were non-linearly registered to group-specific templates created from 11 participants of each group (FA thresholds &gt; 0.2). The resulting FA images were temporally concatenated into a single 4D file and averaged to create a mean \u2018skeleton\u2019, representing the centre of all white matter tracts onto which participant-specific FA values were projected. Tract-based spatial statistics was performed voxel-wise, using a GLM and permutation-based non-parametric testing. The GLM included either planned comparisons between the three groups, or the beta values extracted from the deprived cortex ROI during intact hand movements for each of the individuals with hand absence. An age regressor of no interest was also included for the correlation analysis. Clusters were formed at t &gt; 2 and tested for significance at p&lt;0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons across space. For presentation purposes, the FA clusters were dilated to fill the corresponding tracts."

To exclude the involvement of various confounds from the correlation analysis (e.g., level of amputation, age at deprivation), post-hoc one-tailed partial correlation analysis was performed. To exclude the involvement of various confounds (e.g., phantom pain) from the group comparisons, univariate GLM comparisons were carried, with the confounding measurement as a covariate. To account for the potential contribution of phantom pain on the BOLD differences, chronic levels of phantom pain were assessed in each 1-handed individual. Chronic pain magnitude was calculated by dividing pain intensity (0: \u2018no pain\u2019\u201410: \u2018worst pain imaginable\u2019) by frequency (1\u2014\u2018all the time\u2019, 2 \u2014\u2018daily\u2019, 3\u2014\u2018weekly\u2019, 4\u2014\u2018several times per month\u2019 and 5\u2014\u2018once or less per month\u2019). This measure therefore reflects the chronic aspect of the pain as it combines both frequency and intensity, as used previously (<a href=\"#bib4\">Draganski et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Makin et al., 2013</a>). Comparison between correlations was assessed using a two-tailed Fisher r-to-z transformation. Statistical analysis was carried with SPSS version 18."

As the main purpose of our study was to identify changes in representation in the deprived cortex, and their relationship with adaptive behaviour, we focused our ROI analysis on the deprived cortex and deprived cerebellum. However, this does not rule out the possibility that similar group differences might have been revealed in other brain areas. Indeed, when studying the contrast maps shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, before applying correction for multiple comparisons (i.e., simply after thresholding at Z&gt;2, uncorrected, Author response image 1), effects are found in other areas. As shown below, it appears that during intact hand movements, activation in acquired amputees is increased (compared to the other groups) not only in the deprived sensorimotor cortex and the corresponding cerebellum, but also in other areas ipsilateral to the moving hand, both within (SMA, posterior putamen) and beyond the sensorimotor system (middle and posterior insula). During residual arm movements, increased activation in the congenital group is potentially more prominent in visual areas. Given that the results presented below are highly susceptible to Type II errors, these are inappropriate to include in the paper. Nevertheless, in the revised manuscript we discuss such potential results, and highlight the importance of future research into the relationship between adaptive behaviour and activity in other brain areas that originally enabled sensorimotor control of the missing hand."

Indeed, it has previously been demonstrated in monkeys that plasticity in SI, following arm deafferentation (using lesions to the dorsal horn), doesn't necessarily result in equivalent topographic reorganisation in M1, but rather more subtle changes in movement representations in M1 (Kambi et al. 2011). It\u2019s therefore likely that the over-representation of the intact hand of the acquired amputees would primarily result from reorganisation in SI, whereas reorganisation of the representation of the residual arm, requiring more pronounced changes in motor control, may result in further reorganisation in M1. Indeed, when carefully studying the clusters resulting from the two whole-brain contrast maps presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, we find that the peak voxels are positioned within the posterior bank of the central sulcus for the contrast involving intact hand movements, and both anterior and posterior to the central sulcus for the contrast involving residual arm movements.

This is due to the standard spatial resolution used in this study: As described in our methods, our initial functional voxels were of 27mm (3x3x3mm), and were further smoothed (using a 5mm FWHM), resulting in overlapping sampling of SI and M1. Furthermore, to achieve group comparisons (as carried in both the whole-brain contrasts and the ROI analysis we used), individual functional maps were coregistered to a standard template, using both linear and non-linear transformations, resulting in potential further distortions and inconsistencies in alignment of the central sulcus across participants, thus making it impossible to tease apart SI from M1 with confidence. To demonstrate this point, we divided the deprived cortex ROI into two sub sections \u2013 SI and M1 (while excluding all voxels along the central sulcus, see below), and calculated mean beta values within each sub-region for the two contrasts of interest (hand and arm movements vs. feet movements). When comparing the beta values obtained from each of the sub-ROIs across participants, we found highly significant (p&lt;0.0001) correlations between M1 and S1 values (r(49)=0.89 and 0.77 for the intact hand and residual arm contrasts, respectively; see below, Author response image 2), suggesting that these two ROIs are not independent. Indeed, the comparisons between limbless groups reported in the paper were replicated in both sub-ROIs. For this reason, we decided to continue using the term \u2018sensorimotor\u2019. Given the issues mentioned, we do not believe that these analyses add any useful information and therefore do not propose to include them in the revised manuscript (though would be willing to do so if requested). This issue is now addressed in the Results section of the revised manuscript."

(a) To explore the contributions of SI and M1 to our ROI analysis, we constructed an expanded ROI (by thresholding the conjunction maps for phantom and nondominant hand movements, used to identify the deprived cortex, at Z&gt;6 (cf. Z&gt;7 used for the original ROI). This expansion was necessary to obtain a reasonable sampling of voxels on each side of the central sulcus). We considered voxels anterior to the central sulcus as belonging to M1, and those posterior as belonging to S1. Voxels along the central sulcus itself were excluded as it is not possible to know whether these should be assigned to M1 or to S1. The central sulcus exclusion zone was defined based on an anatomical landmark (approximately 2-4 mm wide, extending along the central sulcus), derived from the MNI 152 template brain. Note that due to these procedures, our original deprived cortex ROI only partially overlaps with these sub-regions. We then extracted individual participants\u2019 fMRI activation values (\u03b2) from each of the sub-regions during intact/dominant hand (left) and residual/nondominant arm (right) movement execution. As seen in (b), beta values across participants showed similar patterns in SI and M1. When comparing the averaged fMRI activation values across groups (c-d), we found highly significant differences between the two limbless populations in both sub-regions.

The two contrasts shown in this figure were constructed based on the patterns of adaptive limb usage, found in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>: for the congenital population, we contrasted residual arm movements against the two other groups; for the acquired population, we contrasted intact hand movements against the two other groups. Both contrasts resulted in a similar map \u2013 a single cluster centred on the hand knob of the central sulcus. In the revised manuscript we\u2019ve adjusted the figure, such that the borders of the different body parts in controls are plotted separately. The overlap between the controls\u2019 \u201chomunculus\u201d and the two independent contrast maps is shown in separate inserts. We hope that this new presentation will also help clarify that the activation maps shown in the figure resulted from a whole-brain comparison and were not restricted by any masks."

As described in the Methods section, the ROI consists of a cluster of voxels selectively activated by the conjunction of phantom and nondominant hand movements (compared to feet movements) in acquired amputees and controls. The threshold of this cluster has been predetermined, based on our previous publication (<a href=\"#bib17\">Makin et al. 2013</a>), which focused on activity relating to the phantom. In the current submission, that same ROI is used to interrogate activity relating to other body parts. The values used in the ROI analysis are the averaged beta values (across all the voxels in this predetermined cluster), quantifying fMRI activation during intact/dominant hand or residual/nondominant arm movements for individual participants. We detail this information in the Methods section of the revised manuscript."

However, the point we were trying to make is that the correlation in the limbless population differed from that found in controls. Indeed, we find highly significant difference between the two correlations (p=0.001) also when comparing the Spearman\u2019s Rho values of the two correlations (using Fisher\u2019s r to z transformation).
