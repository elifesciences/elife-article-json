In previous work, we observed that mast cells (MC) mediate vascular leakage during DENV infection in mice and that levels of MC activation are correlated with disease severity in human DENV patients (<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>). A major risk factor for developing severe dengue is secondary infection with a heterologous serotype. The dominant theory explaining increased severity during secondary DENV infection is that cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies promote uptake of virus and allow enhanced replication. Here, we define another mechanism, dependent on Fc\u03b3R-mediated enhanced degranulation responses by MCs. Antibody-dependent mast cell activation constitutes a novel mechanism to explain enhanced vascular leakage during secondary DENV infection."

In previous work, we observed that mast cells (MC) mediate vascular leakage during DENV infection in mice and that levels of MC activation are correlated with disease severity in human DENV patients (<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>). A major risk factor for developing severe dengue is secondary infection with a heterologous serotype. The dominant theory explaining increased severity during secondary DENV infection is that cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies promote uptake of virus and allow enhanced replication. Here, we define another mechanism, dependent on Fc\u03b3R-mediated enhanced degranulation responses by MCs. Antibody-dependent mast cell activation constitutes a novel mechanism to explain enhanced vascular leakage during secondary DENV infection."

                        "text": "Infection with dengue virus (DENV) can result in a wide range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic, to mild and self-limiting, to severe and occasionally fatal. Febrile disease that is self-resolving is diagnosed as dengue fever (DF). More severe forms of the disease include dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which are characterized by increased vascular permeability and plasma leakage into tissues (<a href=\"#bib13\">Halstead, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">St John et al., 2013a</a>). There are four major serotypes of DENV that infect humans, and a primary DENV infection with any of the four serotypes elicits long-lived antibodies against the primary infection serotype (<a href=\"#bib37\">St John et al., 2013a</a>). Importantly, this DENV-specific humoral response is capable of preventing infection by neutralizing virus of the infecting serotype only. Although the antibody response generated during a primary infection frequently shows some cross-reactivity to other DENV serotypes, these responses are largely non-neutralizing towards viruses of other DENV serotypes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Halstead, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rothman, 2011</a>). Symptomatic re-infection with the same serotype that had been experienced during primary infection has never been reported; therefore, immunological memory is understood to be highly effective against a secondary infection with a homologous serotype (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sabin, 1952</a>). In contrast, symptomatic secondary infection with a heterologous serotype of DENV is relatively common in DENV-endemic regions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Low et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Guilarde et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2014</a>). Some studies have shown that there is an increased risk of developing DHF due to a secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype, or as a result of the presence of maternally transferred heterologous antibodies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Halstead et al., 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Halstead, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kliks et al., 1988</a>)."

                        "text": "One possible explanation for the increased risk of developing severe dengue during secondary heterologous infection is the process known as antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Halstead et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Halstead and O'Rourke, 1977a</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">1977b</a>). It is thought that more severe infections are associated with higher levels of virus replication, which could be attributed to cellular uptake of immune complexes that are internalized by immunoglobulin Fc-receptor (FcR) bearing cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kliks et al., 1988</a>). ADE-promoting immune complexes are generated when pre-existing, non-neutralizing antibodies cross-react with an antigenically distinct heterologous DENV serotype. These weak interactions allow virus binding to antibodies without killing the virus, followed by attachment of immune complexes to cells, which promotes uptake of virus. It is thought that increased viral infection as a result of ADE leads to increased secretion of vasoactive immune products by infected cells, such as TNF-\u03b1, which may promote vascular leakage during DHF (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kliks et al., 1988</a>). Conflicting information regarding the association of TNF-\u03b1, specifically, with severe dengue has been reported (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hober et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chakravarti and Kumaria, 2006</a>) but cytokines produced by DENV-infected cells remain the leading suspects for inducing severe dengue (<a href=\"#bib37\">St John et al., 2013a</a>). This view of ADE emphasizes the role that viral replication plays in generating pro-inflammatory and vasoactive factors. Although ADE, alone, is not sufficient to explain the vascular pathology associated with DHF since many individuals also experience DHF during primary infection, it can explain antibody-dependent increases in viral uptake and infection burden that could promote downstream pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib37\">St John et al., 2013a</a>). Weakly neutralizing antibodies against the DENV structural proteins, including envelope (E) protein domain III and precursor membrane protein, have been observed in human DENV patients (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dejnirattisai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wahala et al., 2012</a>) and the phenomenon of ADE has been shown in vitro and in animal models (<a href=\"#bib11\">Halstead et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shresta et al., 2006</a>); however, ADE has not yet been observed in human DENV patients (<a href=\"#bib37\">St John et al., 2013a</a>). As a result, while many lines of evidence support the theory of ADE as a contributing factor to DENV severity, this does not exclude the possibility of additional mechanisms for antibodies to promote vascular pathology during DENV infection."

Mast cells (MCs), for example, are granulated cells that express a wide range of Fc receptors (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham and St John, 2010</a>). This allows them to bind multiple classes of antibodies, including IgE (through Fc\u03b5RI) and IgG (through Fc\u03b3Rs) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sylvestre and Ravetch, 1996</a>). Human MCs have been shown to express the inhibitory IgG receptor, Fc\u03b3RIIb, as well as the activating receptors, Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIa (which are functionally analogous to Fc\u03b3RIII on mice), albeit with some variations based on tissue and cell activation state (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sylvestre and Ravetch, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Okayama et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Malbec and Da\u00ebron, 2007</a>). MCs are important for pathogen immunosurveillance and pre-store many vasoactive mediators within their granules (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham and St John, 2010</a>). Recent reports showed that MCs, which are localized in tissues near the vasculature (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kunder et al., 2011</a>), are directly activated by DENV, resulting in the release of their pre-formed mediators through the process of degranulation (<a href=\"#bib35\">St John et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2013b</a>). In our previous study, we showed that DENV-elicited MC vasoactive products enhance vascular leakage in animal models (<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>). We also reported that DHF patients with secondary infection, in contrast to DHF patients with primary infection, displayed higher serum levels of the MC-derived protein chymase, a biomarker that is specifically produced by MCs and associated with MC activation (<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>). This suggests that MC degranulation levels are higher in patients with secondary infection, raising the question of how MC responses could be enhanced, mechanistically, during secondary infection (<a href=\"#bib38\">St John, 2013</a>)."

Similarly to other Fc-receptor bearing cells, MCs also can be infected through the process of ADE when immune complexes containing non-neutralized DENV are taken up via Fc receptor-mediated endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib18\">King et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Goncalvez et al., 2007</a>). However, in addition to endocytosis of immune complexes, MCs act as effectors of the adaptive immune system due to their ability to become sensitized by pre-existing circulating antibodies through binding to the Fc receptors (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham and St John, 2010</a>). When antibody is bound in immune complexes, affinity for the IgG receptors increases substantially (<a href=\"#bib40\">Takizawa et al., 1992</a>). Antibody-sensitized MCs can become activated during a secondary challenge when the sensitizing-antigen binds to Ig and cross-links the FcRs or can be activated through binding of immune complexes that have already been formed (<a href=\"#bib28\">Oshiba et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Malbec and Da\u00ebron, 2007</a>). While the downstream effects of antibody-sensitization of MCs have been well-characterized in allergy and hypersensitivity models, there is still a lack of understanding of how this process could be relevant in the context of viral infection. In vitro, it has been shown that MCs sensitized with post-immune serum containing IgE antibodies have increased degranulation in response to DENV (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sanchez et al., 1986</a>). Interestingly, increased DENV-specific IgE antibody levels have been associated with DHF (<a href=\"#bib20\">Koraka et al., 2003</a>). With regards to IgG-mediated MC activation, studies have also shown that IgG immune complexes can promote MC degranulation in mice (<a href=\"#bib41\">Vaz and Ovary, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vaz and Prouvost-Danon, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Da\u00ebron et al., 1992</a>). Moreover, mice deficient in Fc\u03b3RIII lack IgG-mediated MC degranulation, have an impaired Arthus reaction, and are resistant to IgG-dependent passive anaphylaxis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hazenbos et al., 1996</a>). Based on our previous study that demonstrated that MCs are essential for maximal vascular leakage during DENV infection (<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>), we hypothesized that antibody-mediated enhancement of MC activation and degranulation could potentially increase vascular permeability in the associated blood vessels during secondary DENV infection. In this study, we sought to investigate the ability of DENV-specific IgG antibodies to mediate enhanced vascular leakage through MCs and determine the mechanism of this interaction."

Vascular permeability was measured using hematocrit values obtained from blood at the final endpoint (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We found that mice pre-sensitized with 4G2 prior to DENV1 infection had higher hematocrit values compared to those sensitized with control antibody, while 3H5 produced no enhancing effect during DENV1 infection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We previously optimized a technique for measuring vascular leakage due to DENV in the WT mouse model, involving injection of Evan's blue dye (EBD) 30 min prior to euthanasia, followed by perfusion of the mouse vasculature with saline before tissue observation and harvest (<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>). This allowed the measurement of the EBD leakage into the liver by determining the OD-600 from the supernatants of homogenized liver tissue. Using this technique as a secondary method to assess vascular leakage quantitatively, we observed that while DENV1 alone increased vascular leakage over control values, the leakage was significantly enhanced in the presence of antibody 4G2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Again, in contrast to the DENV1\u20134 cross-reactive antibody 4G2, DENV2-specific 3H5 had no effect on vascular leakage when administered prior to a DENV1 challenge (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These quantitative results were also visually supported, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, when mouse livers were imaged after i.v. EBD injection and perfusion of the circulatory system with saline. DENV1 infection alone (without antibody pre-treatment) appears to increase vascular leakage in the liver tissue over control, so that bruising remains on the liver even after the blood has been eliminated from the vasculature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This vascular leakage is not apparent on the livers of uninfected control animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In contrast, the most visually striking vascular leakage occurred in animals pre-treated with 4G2 prior to DENV1 infection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These findings support that the enhanced vascular leakage DENV induces in the presence of antibodies is dependent on antibody specificity to the infecting DENV-serotype."

To identify the role of MCs, we compared vascular leakage between DENV-infected WT mice and MC-deficient mice (Sash) in the presence of 3H5 antibody. As before, mice were injected with 3H5 antibody 24 hr prior to infection with DENV2, and hematocrit levels were measured at 24 hr post-infection. Hematocrit analysis supported MC-dependent antibody-enhanced vascular leakage since WT mice had substantially higher hematocrit values during DENV2 infection in the presence of DENV2-specific antibodies, while MC-deficient Sash mice showed no changes in hematocrit over baseline controls for either DENV2 treatment alone or treatment with 3H5 and DENV2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These results were also supported using the secondary method of quantitating vascular leakage into tissues by measuring EBD leakage into tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). While DENV2 induced significantly increased vascular leakage, the DENV2-specific antibody 3H5 further increased vascular leakage compared to both baseline and DENV2 infection alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We have reported previously that during DENV infection in wild type, immunocompetent mice, vascular perfusion with saline was required to visualize EBD and plasma leakage into highly vascularized tissues such as the liver and kidney (<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>). Surprisingly, when enhancing antibodies were administered 24 hr prior to infection with DENV, the resulting experimental outcome was strong enough that we were able to observe overt leakage of EBD on the gut post-infection during necropsy. In contrast, this overt increase in vascular leakage was not apparent in Sash mice that had similarly been pretreated with 3H5 followed by DENV2 infection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This observation that MCs are required for increased DENV-induced, antibody-enhanced vascular permeability, although qualitative in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, was consistent with the significantly increased vascular leakage in the presence of antibody that was quantitated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>."

There are two activating Fc\u03b3 receptors, Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIa, which are expressed on human MCs that bind the Fc regions of IgG antibodies. Although Fc\u03b3RI could theoretically contribute to MC-degranulation in humans (<a href=\"#bib25\">Malbec and Da\u00ebron, 2007</a>), it has not been identified on mouse MCs, and thus, is not expected to be involved in the mechanism we observed. Therefore, we hypothesized that Fc\u03b3RIII, which serves a similar activating function on mouse MCs, could be primarily involved in DENV-specific IgG-enhanced MC degranulation. To test this hypothesis, bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) were generated from either WT mice or mice deficient in Fc\u03b3RIII (Fc\u03b3RIII-KO). Prior to performing a standard \u03b2-hexosaminidase assay, cells were incubated with the antibodies 4G2 or 3H5, followed by stimulation with DENV2. BMMC degranulation responses to DENV were significantly enhanced in WT BMMCs pre-treated with either antibody, while the antibody-enhanced response was abrogated by Fc\u03b3RIII deficiency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). No difference was observed for direct degranulation responses to DENV in Fc\u03b3RIII-KO BMMCs compared to WT BMMCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Similarly, degranulation of WT and Fc\u03b3RIII-KO BMMCs was assessed in response to DENV1, after exposure of MCs to either DENV1-non-specific antibody, 3H5, or heterologous antibody, 4G2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). As expected, only 4G2, and not 3H5, enhanced WT BMMC degranulation responses to DENV1, but this 4G2-dependent enhancement was not observed in Fc\u03b3RIII-KO BMMCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

The incubation time of antibodies and DENV with MCs was extended to 24 hr post-infection, and the relative amount of viral replication in BMMCs was determined by real time RT-PCR for the viral NS1 gene. Our results showed that both antibody-treated groups of WT, and Fc\u03b3RIII-KO BMMCs had heightened levels of DENV NS1 compared to control cells, although 4G2-treated Fc\u03b3RIII-KO BMMCs had reduced levels of DENV NS1 compared to 4G2-treated WT BMMCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These results demonstrate that Fc\u03b3RIII can also contribute to ADE in BMMCs, but is likely not the only Fc receptor responsible for the enhanced replication that is observed in antibody-treated MCs. Consistent with previous findings, we found that UV-inactivated DENV efficiently induced degranulation, supporting that degranulation responses are uncoupled from viral replication. Furthermore, Fc\u03b3RIII-deficiency reduces the magnitude of ADE in MCs but enhanced viral replication is not completely abrogated, while the antibody-dependent portion of the degranulation response is."

Thus, we evaluated whether vascular leakage could be induced by UV-inactivated DENV in vivo and whether DENV post-immune serum also enhanced vascular leakage. Similar to mice injected with live DENV, inactivated DENV increased hematocrit levels at baseline, and the hemoconcentration was heightened in the presence of post-immune serum (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Concurrently, elevated levels of MCPT1, which is a biomarker for MC activation, could be detected in the serum of animals after both live and inactivated virus challenges (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Mice pre-treated with 4G2 had significantly higher serum levels of MCPT1 than mice given the live or UV-DENV challenges alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). To compare this response to another antigenic challenge, we also adoptively transferred serum from mice immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) and subsequently injected the mice with particulate OVA (pOVA) as a challenge. The particulate form of the antigen was used since MC responses to particulate antigens are heightened compared to soluble antigens (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jin et al., 2011</a>) and also because the size of DENV (\u223c50 nm) approximates the size of nanoparticles, rather than soluble proteins. As expected, mice that were challenged with the pOVA antigen alone did not have elevated hematocrit values at 24 hr, but mice that had been adoptively transferred OVA post-immune serum showed increased hematocrit values (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), supporting that vascular leakage was increased in these animals."

Some of these products include the anti-coagulant heparin, MC-specific proteases, cytokines such as TNF, and other vasoactive factors. We previously detected the MC-specific product chymase at higher levels in the serum of DHF patients with secondary infection, compared to DHF patients experiencing primary infection (<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>). This suggested that MC activation (which is already elevated in primary DHF patients over control or DF patients [<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>]) is further heightened during secondary infection. Others also previously reported that DENV-post immune serum can prompt MC degranulation in response to DENV in vitro; however, it was assumed that this enhancement was due to the possibility that DENV-specific IgE was present in the serum (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sanchez et al., 1986</a>), while any potential role of serum IgG in MC degranulation was not considered. In our current study, our data reveal that pre-existing IgG is able to enhance both MC degranulation and MC-dependent vascular leakage during DENV infection. We also found that MCs have equivalent degranulation responses to live and inactivated virus and that antibodies further enhance degranulation to live and inactivated virus similarly. Importantly, in vivo during a natural infection, both the concentration of antibodies and virus would vary along the course of infection and would presumably influence the degree of MC degranulation and resulting vascular leakage. The observation that MC activation can be augmented by DENV-specific IgG constitutes a novel second mechanism of antibody-enhanced immune pathology during DENV infection that is dependent not on enhanced virus replication but on Fc\u03b3R-mediated augmented MC degranulation responses."

Increased vascular leakage in response to experimentally established systemic infection was not observed in Sash mice, which lack MCs, demonstrating that the enhanced vascular leakage was MC dependent. Furthermore, serum-adoptive transfer studies demonstrate that the mechanism of IgG-enhanced MC responses is dependent on MC-expressed Fc\u03b3RIII. Importantly, Fc\u03b3RIII-deficiency had no effect on direct MC degranulation responses to DENV, and only affected the antibody-enhanced component of the degranulation response. Reconstitution of Sash mice with WT, Fc\u03b3RIII-expressing MCs promoted enhanced vascular leakage in vivo after either monoclonal antibody administration or adoptive transfer of post-immune serum, while vascular leakage in mice reconstituted with Fc\u03b3RIII-KO MCs did not reach the same heightened levels. Interestingly, even homologous serum could enhance MC-dependent vascular leakage in our system, where a sufficient dose of virus is injected i.p. to establish a systemic infection. Others have also observed that homologous antibodies can also promote classical ADE responses involving enhanced replication (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kliks et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yamanaka et al., 2008</a>). However, homologous secondary DENV infections have never been reported in humans and are assumed to be quickly cleared due to a strong and neutralizing adaptive immune response, without the development of symptoms (<a href=\"#bib37\">St John et al., 2013a</a>). Therefore, it is likely that the virus would not achieve sufficient systemic infection levels to cause widespread antibody-dependent MC activation in the context of a naturally acquired secondary homologous infection. Taken together, these data establish the role of Fc\u03b3RIII in immune detection of IgG-DENV immune complexes by MCs in vivo and the downstream vascular pathology that can result from MC activation."

Some data exist to support this mechanism since pre-existing antibodies have been shown to enhance infection in monocytes in the immunocompromised mouse model and human monocytes can also experience enhanced infection ex vivo when exposed to DENV in the presence of heterologous post-immune serum (<a href=\"#bib11\">Halstead et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shresta et al., 2006</a>).

Additionally, we have previously published that the WT mouse model sustains replicating viral infection with the clinical isolate used in this study, particularly in lymphoid organs such as the spleen, and is also detectable in the liver (<a href=\"#bib36\">St John et al., 2013b</a>). However, limited viral replication may accentuate the direct effects of mature virus particles on immune cells, over the products that are generated during cytosolic replication of virus. Therefore, defining this new role for MCs in DENV infection also does not diminish the importance of viral replication to pathogenesis. The products produced by other infected and dying cell types are understood to be influential during DENV-induced immune pathology. Additionally, this WT mouse model displays increased vascular leakage after heterologous challenge; however, we have not observed the severe symptoms of frank hemorrhage or multi-organ failure that are characteristic of the approximately 1% of most severe DENV infections that are diagnosed as DHF/DSS."

Degranulation involves the release of the pre-stored products that are packaged within the granular compartments, and the dominant products stored in granules are heparin and proteases (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kunder et al., 2011</a>). Additional granule-associated mediators include \u03b2-hexosaminidase (the enzyme that is used to quantitate MC degranulation), histamine, TNF, and others (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kunder et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kunder et al., 2009</a>). While both anaphylaxis and DENV infection can ultimately result in systemic dysregulation of the vascular system, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction, variation in the clinical presentation of these responses raises questions about the similarity between the two mechanisms. Certainly, the kinetics of viral infection is different from that of acute allergic responses involving vascular dysregulation. During infection, one would expect that ramping of antigen (in this case, virus) concentration in vivo would occur as infection spreads, in contrast to classical allergic responses, which are usually directed towards a bolus dose of exogenously derived antigen, such as food, drugs, or environmental substances. We expect that these differences in antigen dose, delivery, tissue distribution, and other factors could influence the kinetics and symptoms of vascular pathology and shock, in spite of both conditions involving a component of MC response in the underlying mechanism of pathology."

After eliminating cellular debris by centrifugation the OD-600 of tissue supernatants was measured to quantify the amount of EBD leakage into tissues, based on a standard curve. EBD values were normalized to the tissue mass to give a concentration of EBD within tissues. To obtain hematocrit values, blood was collected in EDTA-tubes from individual mice via the maxillary vein at the designated time points after infection. Blood was run on an automatic hematology analyzer to obtain hematocrit values."

Furthermore, we examined virus replication in WT and Sash mice, Sash-R WT and Sash-R Fc\u03b3RIII-KO, after adoptive transfer of either control or DENV-post immune serum. This experiment captures all of the key experimental variables that are relevant to the study, but again, we did not observe any significant differences in the viral burden amongst groups (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>)."

When mice are passively transferred post-immune serum of OVA-immunized mice, followed by challenge with particulate OVA, this also induces vascular leakage in mice (although unlike DENV and UV-DENV, pOVA does not elevate the vascular leakage at baseline; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Interestingly, DENV is approximately 50nm in size so it would be more analogous to a particulate rather than soluble antigen. MCs have been shown to have enhanced degranulation responses to particulate antigens compared to soluble antigens (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jin et al., 2011</a>)."
