The difficulties associated with recognising excellence in interdisciplinary research have an unfortunate side effect: scientists who leave the safe haven of their home discipline to explore the uncharted territory that lies outside and between established disciplines are often punished rather than rewarded for following their scientific curiosity."

Conversely, scientists who have integrated two previously unrelated areas of research to open up completely new fields of inquiry could also be identified by such an analysis, and recognised accordingly."

Let me be clear, however: any such correction is not intended to compensate an interdisciplinary scientist for his or her personal hardships. Rather, such a correction is needed to prevent seemingly objective evaluation tools from misleading us and, as a result, holding back scientific progress by diverting funds and jobs from people who have the potential to perform truly ground-breaking science."
