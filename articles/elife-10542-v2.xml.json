                    "text": "The size and position of mitotic spindles is determined by the lengths of their constituent microtubules. Regulation of microtubule length requires feedback to set the balance between growth and shrinkage. Whereas negative feedback mechanisms for microtubule length control, based on depolymerizing kinesins and severing proteins, have been studied extensively, positive feedback mechanisms are not known. Here, we report that the budding yeast kinesin Kip2 is a microtubule polymerase and catastrophe inhibitor in vitro that uses its processive motor activity as part of a feedback loop to further promote microtubule growth. Positive feedback arises because longer microtubules bind more motors, which walk to the ends where they reinforce growth and inhibit catastrophe. We propose that positive feedback, common in biochemical pathways to switch between signaling states, can also be used in a mechanical signaling pathway to switch between structural states, in this case between short and long polymers."

Regulation of microtubule length requires feedback to set the balance between growth and shrinkage. Whereas negative feedback mechanisms for microtubule length control, based on depolymerizing kinesins and severing proteins, have been studied extensively, positive feedback mechanisms are not known. Here, we report that the budding yeast kinesin Kip2 is a microtubule polymerase and catastrophe inhibitor in vitro that uses its processive motor activity as part of a feedback loop to further promote microtubule growth. Positive feedback arises because longer microtubules bind more motors, which walk to the ends where they reinforce growth and inhibit catastrophe. We propose that positive feedback, common in biochemical pathways to switch between signaling states, can also be used in a mechanical signaling pathway to switch between structural states, in this case between short and long polymers."

This is the fastest-growing end of the microtubule, although it frequently switches between phases of growth and shrinkage. Previous research has shown that cells containing reduced amounts of Kip2 have much shorter filaments than normal cells. One suggested explanation of these results is that Kip2 controls microtubule growth by transporting a protein that regulates filament length to the plus end of the microtubule."

The microtubules also switch much less frequently between growth and shrinkage in the presence of Kip2. This is because Kip2 moves along filaments at a speed that is greater than the rate at which microtubules grow. This sets up a positive feedback loop that causes microtubule growth to accelerate, as more copies of Kip2 can bind to longer microtubules. Each of these motor proteins can then move to the plus end of the microtubule and help the filament to grow even longer."

Deletion of this kinesin results in nuclear migration defects, and the phenotype is associated with shorter, less abundant cytoplasmic microtubules (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cottingham and Hoyt, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Huyett et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Miller et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Caudron et al., 2008</a>). Conversely, Kip2 overexpression results in hyper-elongated cytoplasmic microtubules (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carvalho et al., 2004</a>). The stabilization of microtubules by Kip2 is thought to be indirect and a consequence of Kip2 transporting the growth regulator Bik1 (Clip170) to microtubule plus ends (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carvalho et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Caudron et al., 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "To test whether Kip2 alone can promote microtubule growth, the activity of full-length, purified Kip2 was measured in dynamic microtubule assays using porcine tubulin in the presence of adenosine\u00a0triphosphate\u00a0(ATP) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gell, et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Within 10 min, Kip2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), as well as Kip2-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), strongly increased the length of freshly polymerized microtubules (p&lt;0.0001, Welch\u2019s unpaired <i>t</i>-test, please refer to <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for porcine microtubule parameter values). The effect of Kip2 on microtubule length was almost completely inhibited when ATP was replaced by the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog adenylyl imidodiphosphate\u00a0(AMP-PNP) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, blue markers, p&lt;0.0001), showing that growth promotion requires ATP hydrolysis. To quantify how Kip2 influences microtubule dynamics, we drew kymographs from the time-lapse images of the dynamic microtubule assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Kip2 increased the growth rate of microtubules (the slope of the growing microtubule in the kymograph) 2.9-fold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In addition, Kip2 reduced the frequency of catastrophe (the transition between growth and shrinkage phases) approximately 10-fold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Kip2 did not affect the shrinkage rate (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), or the frequency of rescue (the transition between shrinkage and growth phases, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). All dynamic data on porcine tubulin are contained in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Note that rescue is not expected to have a large effect on microtubule length in our assays. This is because at lower Kip2 concentrations (&lt; 10 nM), the average distance shortened following catastrophe (the shrinkage rate divided by the rescue frequency) is greater than the average distance grown before catastrophe (the growth rate divided by the catastrophe frequency), so microtubules usually shrink all the way back to the seed (as expected by theory, <a href=\"#bib27\">Verde et al., 1992</a>). On the other hand, at higher Kip2 concentrations, catastrophes are so rare that microtubules are expected to be very long before they catastrophe (&gt;18 \u03bcm for [Kip2] \u2265 10 nM). Consistent with the small contribution of rescue, the measured increase in microtubule length accorded with the effects of Kip2 on the growth rate and the catastrophe frequency alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, red line). The half-maximal stimulation of polymerization and inhibition of catastrophe occurred at \u22487 nM Kip2. Given that the cellular concentration of Kip2 is \u224825 nM (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</a>), these results show that Kip2 affects microtubule dynamics in vitro at physiologically relevant concentrations."

By measuring the rate of growth of porcine microtubules from guanylyl (\u03b1,\u03b2)methylene-diphosphonate\u00a0(GMPCPP) seeds over a range of tubulin concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), we found that Kip2 doubled the effective tubulin association rate constant (<i>k</i><sub>on</sub>, the rate that tubulin is stably incorporated into the microtubule lattice) to 1.5 \u03bcM<sup>-1.</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (at the plus end) from 0.7 \u03bcM<sup>-1.</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> in the absence of Kip2. In addition to accelerating the net addition of subunits, Kip2 also facilitated microtubule nucleation on the seeds, with robust growth observed at tubulin concentrations as low as 4 \u03bcM, compared with 10 \u03bcM in the absence of Kip2 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Thus, Kip2 acted like a nucleation factor in analogy to XMAP215 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Wieczorek et al., 2015</a>). The increased growth rate in the presence of Kip2 is expected to have only a modest effect on catastrophe because doubling the rate of microtubule growth by doubling the tubulin concentration only decreases the catastrophe frequency about twofold (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gardner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Walker, et al., 1988</a>). Our observation that the catastrophe frequency decreased 10-fold might be explained by our finding that 40 nM Kip2 decreased the rate of dissociation of GMPCPP-tubulin subunits from GMPCPP microtubules (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>) approximately threefold (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). If GMPCPP-tubulin acts as an analog for guanosine-5'-triphosphate\u00a0(GTP)-tubulin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hyman et al., 1992</a>), then a decrease in <i>k</i><sub>off</sub> is expected to stabilize the GTP cap and therefore inhibit catastrophe (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bowne-Anderson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Coombes et al., 2103</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Margolin et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the increase in <i>k</i><sub>on</sub> and the decrease\u00a0in <i>k</i><sub>off\u00a0</sub>likely account for most of the decrease in the catastrophe frequency."

                        "text": "To determine how Kip2 targets the plus ends of microtubules, we characterized its biophysical properties in single-molecule motility assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Kymographs revealed that in 1 mM ATP, single Kip2-eGFP molecules associated with GMPCPP-stabilized porcine microtubules along the lattice and walked processively toward the plus end of the microtubule (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The velocity was 5.0 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcm/min at 28\u00b0C (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD], n = 674 traces). The average run distance before dissociating was 4.1 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcm (mean \u00b1 SE, n = 217, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). A similar velocity was observed by <a href=\"#bib20\">Roberts et al. (2014)</a>, though the run distance was shorter (1.2 \u03bcm). At the plus end, Kip2-GFP resided for 30 \u00b1 26\u2009s before dissociating (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 40, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), leading to an accumulation of up to 12 Kip2-eGFP molecules at the plus-end, based on the\u00a0fluorescence intensity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). When the ATP was replaced by the non-hydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP, Kip2-eGFP tightly bound to the lattice and did not translocate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Kip2-eGFP moved slower on dynamic microtubules (2.1 \u00b1 0.89 \u03bcm/min), but this velocity is still greater than the microtubule\u2019s growth speed, so Kip2-eGFP was able to catch up to the growing ends of dynamic microtubules and track them (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Based on these properties, we conclude that Kip2\u2019s mechanism differs from that of the well-studied microtubule polymerase XMAP215. XMAP215 targets ends by diffusion and capture (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brouhard et al. 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Widlund et al. 2011</a>), increases both <i>k</i><sub>on</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>off</sub> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brouhard et al., 2008</a>) and has little effect on catastrophe (<a href=\"#bib32\">Zanic, et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, Kip2\u2019s ATPase activity is necessary for its activity, while XMAP215 is not an ATPase. Thus, Kip2 is a unique regulator of microtubule dynamics. Two models for growth promotion can be envisaged. Kip2 may increase growth rates by shuttling tubulin to the microtubule plus end, locally increasing the tubulin concentration. Alternatively, it could promote microtubule growth by acting as a processive polymerase while at the plus end, similar to XMAP215 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brouhard et al., 2008</a>). More work will be required to distinguish between these and other mechanisms."

Positional tracking of single Kip2-powered microspheres moving along GMPCPP-stabilized porcine microtubules as a function of time under constant load revealed a zero-force speed of 4.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcm/min at 24.5\u00b0C, similar to that measured in the total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) assays. Kip2 stalled at a force of 0.81 \u00b1 0.04 pN (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and showed a nearly linear force-velocity relation with increased velocity as the assisting force was increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). At high forces, the motor often slipped along the microtubule in the direction of the applied force without detaching (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The ability to switch from the slip state to the normal translocation mode is thought to increase processivity by linking together several shorter run lengths (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jannasch et al., 2013</a>). Thus, Kip2 is a processive, low-force motor with long run lengths and end residence times. The low force supports the idea that individual Kip2 motors transport small cargos such as dynein, Bik1, and other molecules (<a href=\"#bib20\">Roberts et al., 2014</a>) rather than organelles, although it is possible that multiple Kip2s could cooperate to move larger cargos. The strong localization to the microtubule plus end accords with Kip2 being a regulator of microtubule dynamics."

Kip3 is a length-dependent depolymerase that uses an antenna mechanism to preferentially localize to the plus ends of longer microtubules (<a href=\"#bib26\">Varga et al., 2009</a>). We therefore tested whether the promotion of microtubule growth by Kip2 is length-dependent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Without Kip2, microtubules grew at a length-independent, constant rate (black circles, p=0.06, Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test on a linear fit to the raw data). By contrast, at low (1\u20132 nM) and intermediate (5\u201310 nM) Kip2 concentrations, long microtubules grew faster than short microtubules (p&lt;0.0001). At high Kip2 concentrations (20\u201340 nM), microtubules again grew at a constant, length-independent rate (green circles, p=0.36); however, at these high Kip2 concentrations, we expect all the length dependence to be in the first few microns, which is not well resolved in these experiments (see green fitted line). An\u00a0analysis of yeast microtubule growth rates as a function of microtubule length yielded similar results (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

To compare the catastrophe frequency at short versus long microtubule lengths, we set a cut-off length at 4 \u03bcm, which equals the run\u00a0length of Kip2. Using data from the dynamic microtubule assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), we measured the catastrophe length for short microtubules as the total distance that microtubules grew while their length (including seed) was shorter than 4 \u03bcm divided by the number of catastrophes that occurred at lengths &lt; 4 \u03bcm. For long microtubules, we summed the distance that microtubules grew while \ufefflonger than\u00a04 \u03bcm (final length minus 4 \u03bcm) and divided by the number of catastrophes that occurred at lengths &gt; 4 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, inset).

By contrast, at 5 nM Kip2, the catastrophe length of longer microtubules was greater than that of shorter microtubules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,</a> p&lt;0.0001).

Similar results were obtained for yeast microtubules at 10 nM Kip2 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B,</a> p&lt;0.0001). Hence, in the absence of Kip2,\u00a0the catastrophe frequency increased with increasing microtubule length, whereas in the presence of Kip2, the\u00a0catastrophe frequency decreased with increasing microtubule length.

Because the rate at which Kip2 translocates exceeds the speed of microtubule growth, Kip2 catches up with the growing end of the microtubule (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) where it promotes growth and inhibits catastrophe. As a consequence, this length dependence leads to positive feedback: the longer the microtubule, the greater the number of motors that land on it (the microtubule acts as an antenna), the higher the number of motors that\u00a0can\u00a0reach the plus end, and the higher the growth rate and lower the catastrophe frequency. This, in turn, leads to longer microtubules, which attract more Kip2\u00a0and\u00a0so\u00a0on. Hence, we expect that once a microtubule is long enough, it will effectively \u201cescape\u201d catastrophe and keep growing almost indefinitely, switching from a catastrophe length of only a few microns in the absence of Kip2 to a length \u2265 40 \u03bcm at high Kip2 concentrations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In this sense, Kip2 \u201cpaves its own way\u201d. Thus, by combining processivity with polymerase activity, Kip2 can perform an elementary \u2018computation\u2019\u00a0that switches short microtubules to long ones. This computation differs from that performed by kinesin-8, a length-dependent depolymerase, which stabilizes microtubule length through negative feedback (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gupta et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Mayr et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Stumpff et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Su, et al., 2013</a>;<a href=\"#bib30\">Widlund, et al., 2011</a> <a href=\"#bib25\">Varga et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">2009</a>)."

Taken together, these two observations imply that almost every Kip2 that lands on a microtubule will reach the growing plus\u00a0end.

We propose that Bik1 may be required to increase Kip2\u2019s processivity in vivo. Feedback can only operate if the run length exceeds the microtubule length. In our in vitro assays, the Kip2 run length was \u22484 \u03bcm, whereas that measured by <a href=\"#bib20\">Roberts et al. (2014)</a>\u00a0was only \u22481 \u03bcm.

Therefore, if the run length of Kip2 in vivo is short, then the requirement for Bik1 in the overexpression assays may be due to Bik1 acting as a processivity factor that increases the run length, thereby allowing more Kip2 to reach the end where it enhances microtubule growth."

For the rescue distance, we divided the total observed distance that microtubules shrank by the total number of rescue events. The relative error (SE) was estimated as the inverse of the square root of the number of events. This assumes that the catastrophe and rescue events are single-step (Poisson) processes. However, if the events are multistep (e.g. from a gamma distribution), as is known to be the case for catastrophe (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gardner et al., 2011</a>), then the actual SE is smaller than the calculated one."

The imaging buffer for optical tweezer experiments contained 1xBRB20 supplemented with 100 mM KCl, 20 mM glucose, 20 \u03bcg/ml glucose oxidase, 8 \u03bcg/ml catalase, 0.1 mg/mlcasein, 0.5% b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM Mg-ATP. The channels were rinsed with 20 \u03bcl imaging buffer with Kip2-functionalized microspheres. For the Kip2-functionalized microspheres, carboxylated polystyrene microspheres (mean diameter 0.59 \u00b5m, Bangs Lab,\u00a0Fishers,\u00a0IN) were bound covalently to anti-GFP antibody via a 3\u2009kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker, which, in turn, bound to the C-terminal eGFP of Kip2-eGFP-6xHis, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jannasch et al., 2013</a>). The measurements were performed at 24.5\u00b0C and under single-molecule concentrations where only one out of four microspheres showed motility."

All measurements were done with a trap stiffness of 0.03 pN/nm. The optical trap was calibrated by analysis of the height-dependent power spectrum density as described previously (<a href=\"#bib24\">Toli\u0107-N\u00f8rrelykke et al., 2006</a>). The force-velocity curve was measured using the constant-force mode. In this mode, the trapping laser was moved with a piezo\u00a0mirror relative to the sample with an update rate of 200\u2009Hz. Overall, we measured and analyzed the motion of 11 different single Kip2-eGFP-6xHis molecules. Data analysis was previously described (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jannasch et al., 2013</a>)."

Also, as noted in the major comment above, the effect of Kip2 on microtubule growth appears to be dependent on its cargo Bik1 (not an organelle but still related to transport).</i>"
