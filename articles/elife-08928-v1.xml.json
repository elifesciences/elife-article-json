We examined the function of a conserved region looped into the membrane domain of RseP to form a \u03b2-hairpin-like structure near its active site in substrate recognition and cleavage. We observed that mutations disturbing the possible \u03b2-strand conformation of the loop impaired RseP proteolytic activity and that some of these mutations resulted in the differential cleavage of different substrates. Co-immunoprecipitation and crosslinking experiments suggest that the loop directly interacts with the transmembrane segments of substrates. Helix-destabilising mutations in the transmembrane segments of substrates suppressed the effect of loop mutations in an allele-specific manner. These results suggest that the loop promotes substrate cleavage by selectively recognising the transmembrane segments of substrates in an extended conformation and by presenting them to the proteolytic active site, which contributes to substrate discrimination."

We examined the function of a conserved region looped into the membrane domain of RseP to form a \u03b2-hairpin-like structure near its active site in substrate recognition and cleavage. We observed that mutations disturbing the possible \u03b2-strand conformation of the loop impaired RseP proteolytic activity and that some of these mutations resulted in the differential cleavage of different substrates. Co-immunoprecipitation and crosslinking experiments suggest that the loop directly interacts with the transmembrane segments of substrates. Helix-destabilising mutations in the transmembrane segments of substrates suppressed the effect of loop mutations in an allele-specific manner. These results suggest that the loop promotes substrate cleavage by selectively recognising the transmembrane segments of substrates in an extended conformation and by presenting them to the proteolytic active site, which contributes to substrate discrimination."

For example, bacteria have an enzyme called RseP that helps to activate responses to external stresses.

This signal molecule then promotes the expression of particular genes to protect the cell from harm."

The enzyme also contains a structure called a \u03b2-hairpin-like loop that is close to the active site, which is not commonly found in membrane proteins. Here, Akiyama, Mizuno et al. used genetic and biochemical techniques to study the role of this loop structure in the RseP enzyme of the <i>E. coli</i> bacterium."

Proteases involved in RIP are called intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) and catalyse the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane segments (TMs) of target membrane proteins within the lipid bilayer. <i>Escherichia coli</i> RseP belongs to S2P zinc metalloproteinase family of I-CLiPs. It plays a key role in regulating the \u03c3<sup>E</sup> extracytoplasmic stress response (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hizukuri et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</a>), in which the dedicated sigma factor \u03c3<sup>E</sup> is activated through the successive cleavage of a single membrane-spanning anti-\u03c3<sup>E</sup> RseA in response to cell surface stresses. The first cleavage catalysed by DegS (site-1 cleavage) on the periplasmic side triggers the intramembrane cleavage by RseP (site-2 cleavage) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alba et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kanehara et al., 2002</a>). Recent studies suggest that in addition to being involved in RseA cleavage, RseP acts in the proteolytic removal of remnant signal peptides from the membrane (<a href=\"#bib37\">Saito et al., 2011</a>). RseP spans the membrane 4 times, with both the termini facing the periplasm. Its central periplasmic region contains tandem PDZ domains (PDZ-N and PDZ-C; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kanehara et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kinch et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Inaba et al., 2008</a>). The S2P family proteases share a conserved core domain containing 3 TMs. In RseP, these correspond to TM1\u2013TM3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kinch et al., 2006</a>). The first and the third TM contain HExxH and LDG active site motifs, respectively. Disulfide crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that TM3 plays a critical role in binding of a substrate TM (<a href=\"#bib27\">Koide et al., 2008</a>). Helix destabilisation of substrate TMs promotes their binding to and cleavage by RseP (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyama et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Koide et al., 2008</a>)."

Previous studies suggest that RseP PDZ domains are involved in the site-1 cleavage-dependence of the site-2 cleavage by RseP (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kanehara et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bohn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Grigorova et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Inaba et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hizukuri and Akiyama, 2012</a>). Although the crystal structure of an S2P homolog (mjS2P) from <i>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2007</a>) has been reported, it does not have a PDZ domain, and the three-dimensional structure of an S2P homolog with PDZ domain(s) is not available. We recently reported the crystal structure of the PDZ tandem of an <i>Aquifex aeolicus</i> RseP homolog. The structure suggests that the 2 PDZ domains create a single pocket-like structure that covers the core membrane domain on the membrane surface (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hizukuri et al., 2014</a>). Structural models and biochemical and genetic results suggest that the PDZ tandem acts as a size-exclusion filter to allow only the periplasmically truncated form of RseA to enter the recessed active site in the membrane domain of RseP (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hizukuri et al., 2014</a>). However, mechanisms underlying substrate proteolysis by RseP remains elusive. It is unclear whether the size-exclusion function of the PDZ tandem is sufficient to discriminate between substrates and non-substrates and how a substrate TM, which assumes an \u03b1-helical conformation that needs to be unwound for proteolysis, is recognised and presented to the proteolytic active site. The mechanism of substrate discrimination and specific cleavage in RIP is one of the major problems to be solved (<a href=\"#bib33\">Langosch et al., 2015</a>). Detailed knowledge of mechanisms underlying substrate discrimination and cleavage would help in controlling the cleavage of membrane proteins by I-CLiPs including S2P proteases."

This membrane-reentrant loop is unique because it is in an extended or \u03b2-strand conformation, whereas a membrane-embedded polypeptide is generally in an \u03b1-helical conformation. Therefore, we have named this region membrane-reentrant \u03b2-loop (MRE \u03b2-loop). The MRE \u03b2-loop is conserved in proteins belonging to groups I and III of S2P subfamilies, including RseP (group I), <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> SpoIVFB (group III) and mjS2P (group III; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ha, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). A recent study showed that the MRE \u03b2-loop of SpoIVFB can be crosslinked with a substrate through disulfide bonds, suggesting its possible involvement in substrate interaction (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). However, functional roles of the MRE \u03b2-loop remain largely unknown. Here, we analysed the function of the RseP MRE \u03b2-loop and found that it could directly bind to and promotes selective cleavage of RseP substrates. Therefore, we propose that the MRE \u03b2-loop stabilises substrate TMs in an extended conformation and presents them to the proteolytic active site."

We constructed an MRE \u03b2-loop deletion mutant (\u0394loop mutant) containing a short linker (Gly\u2013Gly) in place of residues Ile-61 to Glu-75. Accumulation level of the \u0394loop mutant of RseP-HM (RseP with a C-terminal His-Myc bipartite tag) was comparable to that of wild-type RseP-HM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), suggesting that the \u0394loop mutation did not cause global structural changes in RseP. The \u0394loop mutant did not exhibit complementation activity against a \u0394<i>rseP</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Its protease activity was examined using model substrates HA-MBP-RseA148 and HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). HA-MBP-RseA148 is a derivative of the DegS-cleaved form of RseA (RseA148) and contains a maltose-binding protein (MBP) domain with an N-terminal haemagglutinin (HA) tag in place of the cytoplasmic region of RseA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hizukuri and Akiyama, 2012</a>).

The majority of the model substrates, HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148, HA-MBP-YqfG and HA-MBP-YoaJ, was associated with the membrane both after sonical disruption and after alkali extraction, although higher proportions of HA-MBP-YoaJ was recovered in the soluble fractions as compared with the other two model substrates, indicating that most of the SMP-derived model proteins are integrally associated with the membrane."

The protein was converted to a slightly smaller fragment upon co-expression with wild-type RseP-HM but not with RseP-HM E23Q mutant, indicating that HA-MBP-YqfG was cleaved by RseP presumably within its TM. As expected, the \u0394loop mutant did not cleave HA-MBP-YqfG. In contrast, HA-MBP-YoaJ did not undergo any cleavage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Cell fractionation and alkali extraction showed that most HA-MBP-YoaJ was integrally associated with the membrane (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that its inability to undergo cleavage was not because of defective membrane localisation.

We previously used a similar approach to show that several residues in TM3, including Asn-389, play important roles in substrate binding (<a href=\"#bib27\">Koide et al., 2008</a>). Consistent with the previous results, wild-type RseP-HM was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MBP-RseA and HA-MBP-RseA was co-immunoprecipitated with RseP-HM, but no co-immunoprecipitation was observed with RseP-HM having an N389L mutation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

The result that absence of or mutations in the MRE \u03b2-loop interfered with RseP\u2013substrate interaction suggests that the MRE \u03b2-loop is required for stable substrate binding by RseP. Pro substitutions in the proximal part (Ile-61 to Ile-64) of the MRE \u03b2-loop had little effect on substrate proteolysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and decreased co-immunoprecipitation.

However, overexpression of HA-MBP-YoaJ little affected the cleavage of co-expressed HA-RseA148 by RseP. It would be possible that YoaJ interacts with the MRE \u03b2-loop with much lower affinity than RseA does in the membrane, although similar amounts of RseP-HM were co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MBP-YoaJ and HA-MBP-RseA148 after membrane solubilisation. Alternatively, YoaJ might bind to RseP at a site different from that for RseA and other substrate proteins. In this case, deletion of the MRE \u03b2-loop might have indirectly disturbed the former site. The nature of the RseP\u2013YoaJ interaction should be clarified in future study."

This was examined by site-directed in vivo photo-crosslinking experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Amber suppression-mediated incorporation of <i>p</i>-benzoylphenylalanine (<i>p</i>BPA), a non-natural photoreactive amino acid (<a href=\"#bib45\">Young et al., 2010</a>), allowed the expression of RseP-HM derivatives with <i>p</i>BPA in the MRE \u03b2-loop. We examined the crosslinking of plasmid-expressed RseP-HM with chromosomally encoded RseA. We used \u0394<i>rseP</i>/\u0394<i>ompA</i>/\u0394<i>ompC</i> strain as the host strain because <i>rseP</i> can be deleted in <i>rseA</i><sup>+</sup> background when genes encoding outer membrane proteins OmpA and OmpC are deleted (<a href=\"#bib9\">Douchin et al., 2006</a>). The host strain expressed DegS, which cleaved some amount of RseA to RseA148. Expression of <i>p</i>BPA-containing RseP-HM proteins decreased the accumulation of RseA148, indicating the functionality of these proteins, although some exhibited lower proteolytic activity against RseA (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). After the exposure of cells to UV irradiation, the proteins were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Anti-RseA immunoblotting showed UV irradiation produced bands of approximately 71 kDa (XL) when <i>p</i>BPA was incorporated at position 69, 71 or 74, suggesting that these bands represented photo-crosslinked products between RseP-HM and RseA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, upper panels). However, these bands were not detected by anti-Myc immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, lower panels). As the expression level of plasmid-expressed RseP-HM was much higher than that of chromosomally encoded RseA, it seemed likely that only a small portion of RseP-HM was crosslinked with RseA. The over-expression of RseP-HM caused an increased background, making it difficult to detect weak bands of crosslinked products by anti-Myc immunoblotting. To confirm whether the 71 kDa band represented an RseP\u2013RseA crosslinked product, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments by using total proteins obtained from UV-irradiated RseP(Y69<i>p</i>BPA)-HM-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Anti-RseA antibody precipitated a predominant 71 kDa band that reacted with both anti-RseA and anti-RseP antibodies (upper panels). Anti-Myc antibody also precipitated a single anti-RseA-reactive protein of 71 kDa (lower left panel). Although no clear band of the corresponding size was obtained after anti-RseP immunoblotting (lower right panel), this may be due to increased background disturbance because of the high expression of RseP-HM. These results further support the notion that the 71 kDa band was the RseP\u2013RseA crosslinked product."

An RseP-HM variant having a unique Cys residue at position 69, 70 or 71 was co-expressed with HA-RseA140, which has a unique Cys at position 109, or with its variant HA-RseA(A108C/C109A)140, which has a unique Cys in place of Ala-108 (Cys-109 was replaced with Ala), in a \u0394<i>rseA</i>/\u0394<i>rseP</i>/\u0394<i>degS</i> strain.

                                "text": "We previously showed that helix-destabilising residues in substrate TMs promote the binding and cleavage of a substrate by RseP (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyama et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Koide et al., 2008</a>). Our current results showed that several Pro substitutions in the MRE \u03b2-loop exerted opposite effects, that is, they compromised substrate binding and cleavage. Therefore, we examined whether destabilisation of a substrate TM helix improves its cleavage by RseP MRE \u03b2-loop mutants. Because the MRE \u03b2-loop was inserted halfway into the membrane from the cytoplasmic side, we replaced each residue in the N-terminal region (Ile-8 to Phe-15) of the presumed YqfG TM by a Pro residue, a strong helix destabiliser, and investigated its cleavage by RseP G67P and K71P mutants, which showed severe and moderate defects, respectively, in cleaving HA-MBP-YqfG (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Wild-type RseP-HM cleaved all the HA-MBP-YqfG mutants almost as efficiently as it cleaved the original HA-MBP-YqfG (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). L11P and L12P mutations but not other mutations appreciably increased the cleavage by RseP(G67P)-HM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In contrast, cleavage by RseP(K71P)-HM was markedly improved by mutations other than L12P and L13P. L12P and L13P also improved cleavage, but their effects were much lower (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We focused on 2 YqfG TM mutations I8P and L12P that resulted in differential cleavage by RseP(G67P)-HM and RseP(K71P)-HM and confirmed their effects by pulse-chase experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). RseP(WT)-HM efficiently cleaved wild-type HA-MBP-YqfG and its I8P and L12P mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). G67P mutation in the RseP MRE \u03b2-loop severely impaired its ability to cleave wild-type HA-MBP-YqfG. Only some cleavage was observed after the 60 min chase period (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). K71P mutation, which had a weaker effect on immunoblotting, also impaired the ability of RseP to cleave wild-type HA-MBP-YqfG during the 15 min chase period (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). RseP(G67P)-HM significantly cleaved HA-MBP-YqfG(L12P) but not HA-MBP-YqfG(I8P) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) and RseP(K71P)-HM efficiently cleaved HA-MBP-YqfG(I8P) but not HA-MBP-YqfG(L12P) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), which was consistent with the immunoblotting results. Replacement of Leu-12 in YqfG by Asn, another strong helix-destabilising amino acid, also promoted cleavage by the RseP MRE \u03b2-loop Pro mutants. However, replacement of the same residue by a helix-forming Trp residue resulted in no increase in cleavage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>), suggesting that helix destabilisation is important for improving substrate cleavage. The I8P or L12P mutation did not promote cleavage by the RseP \u0394loop variant, indicating that these mutations did not bypass the RseP MRE \u03b2-loop function for substrate cleavage (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Deletion or Pro substitution in the MRE \u03b2-loop impaired substrate cleavage, indicating its critical role in the proteolytic function of RseP. Crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the MRE \u03b2-loop was directly involved in substrate binding.

However, no secondary structure is assigned for the distal part of the MRE \u03b2-loop. Analysis of the secondary structure with STRIDE (<a href=\"#bib13\">Frishman and Argos, 1995</a>) suggested that Val<sup>80</sup>-Ala-Met in the distal part forms a \u03b2-strand (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>).

In contrast, substrate cleavage was severely impaired by Pro substitutions. These observations suggest that a higher-order structure of the MRE \u03b2-loop is important for the proteolytic function of RseP. Interestingly, some Pro substitutions in the MRE \u03b2-loop resulted in the differential cleavage of the 3 model substrates. Pulse-chase experiments showed that RseP(G68P)-HM significantly cleaved LY1 but only slightly cleaved RseA TM and YqfG TM. In contrast, RseP(K71P)-HM efficiently cleaved RseA TM and LY1 but only slightly cleaved YqfG TM. These 3 substrates were rapidly cleaved by wild-type RseP-HM. Therefore, the effects of MRE \u03b2-loop mutations cannot be simply explained by the intrinsic susceptibility of these substrates to RseP. In addition, some mutations in YqfG TM suppressed G67P and K71P mutations of the RseP MRE \u03b2-loop in an allele-specific manner. The I8P mutation improved the proteolysis by RseP(K71P)-HM but not by RseP(G67P)-HM, whereas the L12P mutation improved the proteolysis by RseP(G67P)-HM compared with that of RseP(K71P)-HM. Similarly the F21P, but not F20P, mutation in the LacY TM1 region (LY1) partially suppressed the V70P mutation of the RseP MRE \u03b2-loop.

Pro substitutions in the MRE \u03b2-loop markedly decreased the co-immunoprecipitation of RseP-HM with HA-MBP-RseA after membrane solubilisation, suggesting that the integrity of the MRE \u03b2-loop is required for stable RseP\u2013substrate interaction. Disulfide- and photo-crosslinking experiments showed that residues at positions 69 and 71 of the MRE \u03b2-loop contact with substrates. Cys residues at these positions disulfide-bonded with Cys residues on either side of the scissile bond in RseA. A similar result was reported recently for SpoIVFB and its substrate Pro-\u03c3<sup>K</sup> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). A Cys residue in place of Val-70 in the MRE \u03b2-loop of SpoIVFB formed disulfide bonds with Cys residues at several positions around the cleavage site in Pro-\u03c3<sup>K</sup>, suggesting that the MRE \u03b2-loop of SpoIVFB directly interacts with Pro-\u03c3<sup>K</sup>. However, the role of the MRE \u03b2-loop in SpoIVFB function has not been investigated experimentally. Although RseP also has a Val residue at the position corresponding to Val-70 in SpoIVFB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), we did not observe any substrate crosslinking at this position. This might be due to differences in the mode of enzyme\u2013substrate interaction between RseP and SpoIVFB. Indeed, the substrates of these enzymes show some differences. In contrast to RseA, which is a single-spanning membrane protein with type II orientation, Pro-\u03c3<sup>K</sup> is suggested to be peripherally associated with the membrane (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). In addition, although helix-destabilising residues in substrate TMs are important for their efficient cleavage by RseP, these residues are not required for the cleavage of Pro-\u03c3<sup>K</sup> by SpoIVFB (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the role of the MRE \u03b2-loop in substrate binding and cleavage might slightly differ between RseP and SpoIVFB."

The TM4 (corresponding to RseP TM3) of mjS2P that contains one of the active site residues (corresponding to Asp-402 in RseP TM3) can be located in the vicinity of the proteolytic active site and the MRE \u03b2-loop (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2007</a>). We previously showed that Cys introduced at the positions of Pro-397 and Pro-399 in RseP TM3 can form a disulfide bond with Cys at multiple positions of RseA TM. In mjS2P, the residues corresponding to Pro-397 and Pro-399 of RseP reside in a loop-like structure.

Many zinc metalloproteinases have a \u03b2-strand (edge strand) close to their proteolytic active site that binds to substrates in an extended conformation through \u03b2-strand addition and presents them to catalytic residues (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stocker and Bode, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Langklotz et al., 2012</a>). Our results suggest that the MRE \u03b2-loop stabilises the extended conformation of a substrate by directly binding to it through \u03b2-strand addition, thus promoting substrate cleavage in a manner similar to the edge strand (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Crosslinking at alternate positions in the Tyr<sup>69</sup>-Val-Lys region supports the idea that this region is in a \u03b2-strand conformation during its interaction with a substrate. According to this model, mutations that disrupt the secondary structure of the distal part of the MRE \u03b2-loop would compromise its interaction with a substrate. Introduction of a Pro residue will disturb substrate accommodation through \u03b2-strand addition or interstrand interaction because Pro residues cannot serve as hydrogen bond donors because of the absence of the amide proton. Moreover, if the compromised interaction of the MRE \u03b2-loop with a substrate prevents efficient conformational conversion of the substrate TM and decreases its cleavage efficiency, destabilisation of the \u03b1-helical structure of the substrate TM might improve its cleavage by RseP MRE \u03b2-loop mutants, which is consistent with our results. A recent structural study of <i>E. coli</i> GlpG that belongs to the rhomboid family of I-CLiPs revealed that the P1\u2013P4 region of a substrate forms a \u03b2-sheet with the GlpG loop 3 located near the active site (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zoll et al., 2014</a>). Mutations in loop 3 severely compromise the GlpG activity, suggesting the interaction between the substrate and loop 3 is functionally important (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baker and Urban, 2012</a>). Although the loop 3 of GlpG and the MRE \u03b2-loop of RseP differ in that the former is located near the periplasmic surface of the membrane and forms a parallel \u03b2-sheet with a substrate whereas the latter is located near the cytoplasmic surface and forms a anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet, they might have a similar role in stabilising an extended substrate structure and promoting its cleavage."

MRE \u03b2-loop-assisted cleavage of a substrate may be affected by helix stability and amino acid sequence of substrate TMs. We recently suggested that the periplasmic PDZ tandem of RseP acts as a size-exclusion filter to prevent the cleavage of substrates with bulky periplasmic domains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hizukuri et al., 2014</a>).

Because the PDZ filter excludes intact RseA from the intramolecular active site, the presumed exosite may exist on the external surface of the enzyme. Other families of I-CLiPs such as rhomboid and \u03b3-secretase have also been suggested to have an exosite (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kornilova et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Strisovsky et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Watanabe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arutyunova et al., 2014</a>).

The <i>clpP</i>::<i>cat</i> marker was introduced to stabilise the RseP-cleaved fragment of HA-MBP-RseA148. KA418 was constructed as follows. First, \u0394<i>ompA</i>::<i>kan</i> from JW0940 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baba et al., 2006</a>) was introduced into CU141 by P1 transduction, and the <i>kan</i> cassette of the resulting strain was deleted using pCP20, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib8\">Datsenko and Wanner, 2000</a>). Introduction of \u0394<i>ompC</i>::<i>kan</i> from JW2203 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baba et al., 2006</a>) and deletion of the <i>kan</i> cassette were performed in a similar manner to yield YH426.

We thus constructed KA418 by re-introducing F\u2032<i>lac</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>lacI</i><sup><i>q</i></sup> into KA363 by conjugation.

As the RseA TM has unusually low hydrophobicity (for example, TMHMM program does not predict the RseA TM as a \u201ctrue\u201d TM segment), we suppose that the Pro substitutions would interfere with membrane integration. We thus used HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148. We found that the F21P mutation in LY1 significantly improved the cleavage of LY1 by RseP(V70P)-HM, an MRE \u03b2-loop mutant almost defective in cleavage of wild type LY1, but the Pro substitution of the neighbouring residue Phe-20 did not, suggesting that Pro substitutions could generally suppress the MRE \u03b2-loop mutations in an allele-specific manner. These points were described in Results (subsection \u201cSuppression of MRE \u03b2-loop mutations by destabilising substrate TM helices\u201d) and Discussion (fourth paragraph) and the data was presented as <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> in the revised manuscript."

On the other hand, the HA-MBP-YoaJ did not stably interact with the RseP\u0394loop mutant, suggesting that the MRE \u03b2-loop might directly or indirectly affect the binding of YoaJ to RseP. However, overexpression of HA-MBP-YoaJ little affected the RseP-dependent cleavage of co-expressed RseA. It would be possible that YoaJ interacts with the MRE \u03b2-loop with much lower affinity than RseA does in the membrane, although similar amounts of RseP was pulled down with YoaJ and RseA after membrane solubilization. Alternatively, the binding sites for YoaJ and RseA (and other cleavable substrates) are not the same. In this case, the deletion of the MRE \u03b2-loop might indirectly affect the YoaJ-binding site. Further detailed investigation will be needed to characterize the nature of YoaJ-binding to RseP and we would like to address this issue in future study.

We have previously shown that Cys introduced at the positions of Pro-397 and Pro-399 in RseP TM3 can form a disulfide bond with Cys at multiple positions of RseA TM. In mjS2P, the residues corresponding to Pro-397 and Pro-399 of RseP reside in a loop-like structure in TM4. The region containing residues 397 and 399 might be flexible and act with the MRE \u03b2-loop in stable binding of a substrate. This point is described in the Discussion."
