While the function of TorsinA remains elusive, the \u0394E mutation is known to diminish binding of two TorsinA ATPase activators: lamina-associated protein 1 (LAP1) and its paralog, luminal domain like LAP1 (LULL1). Using a nanobody as a crystallization chaperone, we obtained a 1.4 \u00c5 crystal structure of human TorsinA in complex with LULL1. This nanobody likewise stabilized the weakened TorsinA\uf044E-LULL1 interaction, which enabled us to solve its structure at 1.4 \u00c5 also. A comparison of these structures shows, in atomic detail, the subtle differences in activator interactions that separate the healthy from the diseased state. This information may provide a structural platform for drug development, as a small molecule that rescues TorsinA\u0394E could serve as a cure for primary dystonia."
