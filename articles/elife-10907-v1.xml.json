                    "text": "Many cell-intrinsic mechanisms have been shown to regulate neuronal subtype specification in the mammalian neocortex. However, how much cell environment is crucial for subtype determination still remained unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of <i>Protocadherin20 (Pcdh20</i>), which is expressed in post-migratory neurons of layer 4 (L4) lineage, caused the cells to localize in L2/3. The ectopically positioned \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d lost their L4 characteristics but acquired L2/3 characteristics. Knockdown of a cytoskeletal protein in the future L4 neurons, which caused random disruption of positioning, also showed that those accidentally located in L4 acquired the L4 characteristics. Moreover, restoration of positioning of the <i>Pcdh20</i>-knockdown neurons into L4 rescued the specification failure. We further suggest that the thalamocortical axons provide a positional cue to specify L4 identity. These results suggest that the L4 identity is not completely determined at the time of birth but ensured by the surrounding environment after appropriate positioning."

However, how much cell environment is crucial for subtype determination still remained unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of <i>Protocadherin20 (Pcdh20</i>), which is expressed in post-migratory neurons of layer 4 (L4) lineage, caused the cells to localize in L2/3. The ectopically positioned \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d lost their L4 characteristics but acquired L2/3 characteristics. Knockdown of a cytoskeletal protein in the future L4 neurons, which caused random disruption of positioning, also showed that those accidentally located in L4 acquired the L4 characteristics. Moreover, restoration of positioning of the <i>Pcdh20</i>-knockdown neurons into L4 rescued the specification failure. We further suggest that the thalamocortical axons provide a positional cue to specify L4 identity. These results suggest that the L4 identity is not completely determined at the time of birth but ensured by the surrounding environment after appropriate positioning."

Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the cortical neurons acquire a birth-date-dependent segregation mechanism before their somas reach the MZ (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ajioka and Nakajima, 2005</a>). Previous transplantation studies of ferret cerebral cortical neurons suggest that the ultimate laminar fate (whether they eventually come to reside in the superficial layers or in the deep layers) is determined, at least to some extent, in the progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">McConnell and Kaznowski, 1991</a>). Recent in vitro culture studies also suggested a cell-intrinsic mechanism of subtype specification of cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eiraku et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gaspard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shen et al., 2006</a>); however, only a limited number of subtype specific markers were applied in these studies, still leaving it an open question whether all laminar fates are intrinsically determined."

The neocortex of mutant mice, such as homozygous mutant mice for <i>Reln<sup>rl</sup></i> (also known as <i>reeler</i>),which contains an almost normal set of cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dekimoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hevner et al., 2003</a>), but severely disorganized cortical lamination, shows some changes in subtype specification (<a href=\"#bib50\">Polleux et al., 2001</a>). In addition, several subtype-specific characteristics of cortical neurons appear in the post-migratory phase, when the cortical layers begin to develop, implying that additional events of subtype specification may also take place. For example, pyramidal neurons begin to develop their apical dendrites only after the neurons settle beneath the MZ (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bayer and Altman, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Marin-Padilla, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tabata and Nakajima, 2001</a>). Furthermore, a number of subtype-specific molecular markers can be detected only in post-migratory neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alcamo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arlotta et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Britanova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kwan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lai et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, there is a high degree of plasticity in the identity of postmitotic cortical neurons, which was revealed by ectopic expression of a subtype-specific transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib14\">De la Rossa et al., 2013</a>). We previously reported a set of genes that are preferentially expressed in the superficial region of the developing CP, including the primitive cortical zone (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sekine et al., 2011</a>), of the mouse, and proposed that several events critical for proper neuronal maturation and layer formation must take place beneath the MZ (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sekine et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tachikawa et al., 2008</a>). However, it is still not established whether the neuronal subtype might also be affected by the microenvironment in the cortical layers after radial migration."

In contrast, most of the other neocortical neurons transmit output signals to subcortical regions or other cortical regions such as the contralateral cortex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arlotta et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Thomson and Bannister, 2003</a>). Thalamocortical axons terminate primarily in L4, and the signals received in L4 are transduced mainly to L2/3 neurons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lopez-Bendito and Molnar, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Thomson and Bannister, 2003</a>). Reflecting their specific functions, L4 neurons show a round shape and granular morphology with multiple short dendrites, which is unique, and distinct from other neocortical \u201cpyramidal\u201d neurons. In addition to these unique morphological characteristics, several genes are also expressed preferentially in L4 neurons, such as <i>Rorb</i> (also known as <i>ROR\u03b2), Unc5d</i> and <i>Coup-tf1</i> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nakagawa and O'Leary, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pouchelon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhou et al., 1999</a>), suggesting underlying some mechanisms that might regulate the specification of L4 neurons at a molecular level. In this study, we newly identified a non-clustered protocadherin, <i>Protocadherin20 (Pcdh20</i>), which encodes a putative transmembrane protein, as a gene that begins to be expressed in immature postmitotic neurons, and is expressed in L4 neurons in the postnatal stages."

Various RNAi vectors together with a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing vector were injected into the lateral ventricles of the mouse embryos on E14.0 and introduced into cortical cells by electroporation. First, the pups were sacrificed on P7, by which time, the basic structure of the neocortex was already expected to have formed. In the controls, most of the GFP-positive cells with CONsh or PC20sh_mut in the somatosensory cortex were located in L4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). On the other hand, electroporation of PC20sh changed the laminar location of the GFP-positive cells to more superficial layers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). In addition, another shRNA vector targeting the 3\u2019UTR of the <i>Pcdh20</i> gene also disrupted the laminar positioning of the electroporated cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). The specificity of PC20sh for <i>Pcdh20</i> was further confirmed by an experiment in which co-introduction of an RNAi-resistant Pcdh20-expressing vector (resPcdh20) with PC20sh recovered the defect of neuronal positioning of the PC20sh-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also analyzed the effects of <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown on deep layer neurons by transfecting the shRNA vectors on E12.5, when L5 and L6 neurons were expected to be produced.

To determine whether the <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown affected the neuronal positioning by inhibiting radial migration of the neurons toward the MZ or by a mechanism operative after the radial migration, a series of time-course experiments were performed. Brains electroporated on E14.0 were analyzed on E16.5, E18.0 and P2, the time-points roughly corresponding to mid-migration, end of migration and post-migration, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013K</a> and data not shown). On E16.5 and E18.0, few differences were observed between the control and <i>Pcdh20</i>-knockdown brains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I,L</a> and data not shown). In contrast, analysis of the P2 brains, in which the \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d had started to form a layer structure beneath the primitive L2/3, revealed that the <i>Pcdh20</i>-knockdown cells were located in a slightly more superficial position than that in the controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K,M</a>).

It is thus possible that misspecification of the neuronal laminar identity after <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown was caused as a result of additional or delayed cell divisions. To address this question and determine whether the laminar specification was indeed changed by <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown in the postmitotic cells, we performed electroporation of the shRNA and GFP vectors on E14.0 and subsequently labeled the entire population of mitotic cells by serial injections of BrdU every 5\u2009hr for 20\u2009hr immediately after the electroporation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In this experiment, the population of GFP-positive and BrdU-negative cells (referred to as GFP<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>\u2013</sup> cells) was thought to represent postmitotic neurons or cells in the very late stages of the cell cycle in terminal mitosis in the VZ at the time of the electroporation, based on the following reasons. First, plasmid vectors are incorporated primarily into VZ cells by in utero electroporation. Second, since the duration of the S phase at this stage is about 4\u2009hr, and since the nuclei in the S phase can be labeled for at least 2\u2009hr after a single injection of BrdU (<a href=\"#bib66\">Takahashi et al., 1992</a>), injections of BrdU at intervals of up to 6\u2009hr are sufficient for labeling all the mitotic VZ cells. Finally, the total length of the cell cycle is about 15\u2009hr, which is shorter than the total period of BrdU application (see ref. (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tabata et al., 2009</a>) for more details). These GFP<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>\u2013</sup> cells are included in the \u201cslowly exiting population\u201d, a population that becomes postmitotic in the VZ and migrates out slowly into the multipolar cell accumulation zone above the VZ (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tabata et al., 2009</a>)."

The extent of decrease in the percentage of Rorb-positive cells was comparable in all cell populations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggesting that the effect of <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown was not influenced by whether the knockdown vector was introduced into a postmitotic population or a mitotic population.

These previous discrepancies might have been caused by the differences in their experimental conditions. We examined the effect of DN-RhoA at E18.0, when future L4 neurons just finished migration and started to mature. We found that there was no significant difference in cell positioning between control and DN-RhoA expressing cells at least at the concentration/condition we used (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the DN-RhoA-expressing neurons settle in the ridge of the CP similarly to normal cells after radial migration, although they could have migrated differently. Therefore, the phenotype observed at P7 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) was thought to be caused mainly by the event after radial migration toward the brain surface is completed. However, we do not exclude the possibility that there might be an additional effect of migration difference on subtype specification, especially in the case of enhanced migration, because there was a tendency (not statistically significant) for the DN-RhoA-expressing cells to position in deeper layers at P7 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a> (bins 4\u20136)). One might suspect that accelerated neuronal migration could cause premature differentiation, which would result in more cells in deeper layers, although this effect of DN-RhoA, if any, was thought to be minor."

One is that the two phenotypes might arise independently, and the other two are that the disrupted neuronal positioning may affect the neuronal specification, or vice versa. To distinguish among these possibilities, we sought to disrupt the neuronal positioning of \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d using another method. We took advantage of knockdown of <i>Doublecortin (Dcx</i>), since knockdown of this gene in the mouse neocortex has been reported to cause random disruption of neuronal positioning (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baek et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ramos et al., 2006</a>). We focused on the cells that came to reside in the superficial layers (L2\u20134) for the purpose of this study. The proportions of Rorb- as well as KCNH5-positive cells among the GFP-positive cells located in L2\u20134 were dramatically decreased by <i>Dcx</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013E</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Correspondingly, the proportions of Lhx2- as well as Satb2-positive cells were markedly increased by <i>Dcx</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013K</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>), implying the importance of cell positioning. On the other hand, no change in the proportion of Tbr1-positive cells was noted in association with <i>Dcx</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L\u2013N</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1I,J</a>), suggesting that Tbr1 expression may not be regulated simply by cell positioning. To investigate the relationship between subtype specification and the ultimate laminar positioning, we further examined the proportions of Rorb-positive cells among <i>Dcx</i>-knockdown neurons residing in L2/3 or L4. The majority of the neurons positioned in L4 expressed Rorb (72%), whereas none of the neurons in L2/3 expressed this marker (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These results suggest that the ultimate cell positioning determines most of the neuronal characteristics of the neurons labeled on E14.0, that is, into L2/3 or L4 neurons."

We focused on TCAs, because the timing of invasion of these axons into the neocortex and the immature L4 (perinatal stages) is well correlated with that of maturation of the L4 neurons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lopez-Bendito and Molnar, 2003</a>). It is thus possible that TCAs invading upward from the deeper part of the CP may provide a positional cue to the cortical neurons. We therefore analyzed <i>Pcdh10</i> (also known as <i>OL-protocadherin</i> or <i>OL-pc</i>)-knockout mice, in which the TCAs are severely disturbed (<a href=\"#bib70\">Uemura et al., 2007</a>). First, we examined the extent to which the TCAs are lost in the neocortex of this mutant line. Immunohistochemistry for NetrinG1, a TCA-specific marker, revealed a marked decrease of the TCAs in the brains of the <i>Pcdh10 (OL-pc</i>) knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). We next examined the expressions of several subtype-specific markers to investigate layer identities on P3 and P7. We found that expression of Rorb was markedly decreased in <i>Pcdh10 (OL-pc</i>) knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>). In parallel with the decrease in the expression of the L4 marker, expressions of Lhx2 and Tbr1, both of which are not expressed in L4 in the control neocortex, were increased in the mutant neocortex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F\u2013K</a>). These results suggest that the neurons that are destined to become L4 neurons lose their L4 identity and instead acquire some of the L2/3 characteristics, presumably because of the absence of the TCAs. Moreover, these results are similar to the misspecification phenotype of the malpositioned neurons by <i>Pcdh20</i> or <i>Dcx</i> knockdown, suggesting that TCAs might provide a positional cue to immature L4 neurons."

We propose that the laminar identities of neurons within the superficial layers (L2\u20134) of the CP are not completely specified until the neurons arrive beneath the MZ; the ultimate fates of the L2/3 and L4 neurons are specified in the post-migratory phase according to the positioning of the cells. In this model, \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d are positioned in the deeper part of the superficial layers in a Pcdh20-RhoA-dependent manner after radial migration to the top of the CP, and then differentiate into mature L4 neurons, presumably by receiving signals from TCAs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7L</a>). Although post-migratory neurons were generally thought to just pile up on the earlier-settled neurons after radial migration, our results imply that the processes that take place after radial migration are also precisely regulated and are critical for correct laminar positioning of at least the \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d."

In previous studies, the <i>Reln<sup>rl</sup>/Reln<sup>rl</sup></i>neocortex, in which the cortical laminar structure is largely inverted and considerably disorganized, was shown to contain an almost normal set of neuronal subtypes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dehay and Kennedy, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hevner et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Polleux et al., 1998</a>). Another relevant observation is that when future L2/3 neurons were induced to localize in L5, they did not acquire the characteristics of L5 neurons (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ramos et al., 2006</a>). Here, we showed regulation by Pcdh20 of the cell positioning of \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d and also specification of their laminar identity, and concluded the causal effect of cell positioning regulated by Pcdh20 on L4 specification, which was supported by the results of the following experiments. First, malpositioning of the neurons by another method (i.e., knockdown of <i>Dcx</i>) reproduced the failure of the laminar identity specification of the L4 neurons. Second, loss of Pcdh20 caused misspecification of L4 neurons only in vivo but not in an in vitro\u00a0primary culture, where positional effects did not exist. Third, recovery of cell positioning into L4 even in the absence of <i>Pcdh20</i> rescued the L4 characteristics. One might suspect that this model is controversial to the observation in the <i>Reln<sup>rl</sup>/Reln<sup>rl</sup></i>cortex, where L4 neurons are actually generated. In this mutant, a substantial amount of TCAs was reported to grow into the mutant CP, although they pass a bizarre course (<a href=\"#bib19\">Caviness and Frost, 1983</a>), which could be enough to induce L4 specification."

First, the expression of <i>Pcdh20</i> mRNA was undetectable or very low, if any, in progenitor cells, but became clearer in the postmitotic neurons beneath the MZ, as evaluated by in situ\u00a0hybridization and higher by quantitative RT-PCR. Consistent with this finding, the distribution of the <i>Pcdh20</i>-knockdown neurons remained normal before and during radial neuronal migration, but became disrupted after the neurons settled beneath the MZ. Moreover, introduction of the <i>Pcdh20</i>-knockdown vector even in a postmitotic population caused misspecification of the L4 neurons. Finally, expression of Pcdh20 in the postmitotic neurons was able to rescue the phenotypes induced by <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown. This idea, of postmitotic regulation of subtype specification, is also supported by the fact that many subtype-specific genes play roles in postmitotic neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alcamo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arlotta et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Britanova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kwan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Leone et al., 2014</a>) and that there is a high level of plasticity in the identity of postmitotic cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">De la Rossa et al., 2013</a>)."

These observations suggest that \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d have the capacity to differentiate into L2/3 neurons even in the postmitotic stage. Our results, however, also suggest regulation, at least in part, of the laminar fates in the progenitor cells, because the <i>Pcdh20</i>-knockdown \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d had \u201cimperfect\u201d characteristics as compared to the normal L2/3 neurons, such as poorly developed basal dendrites and relatively mild conversion of the axonal projection patterns in the knockdown neurons located in L2/3."

We observed that the effect of dominant-negative RhoA mimicked the failure in neuronal positioning induced by <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown, and that CA-RhoA was able to restore the phenotypes of the <i>Pcdh20</i>-knockdown neurons. The relationship between protocadherin and RhoA has also been shown in other systems (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chung et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Unterseher et al., 2004</a>). Although we do not yet know the mechanism underlying the activation of RhoA by Pcdh20, a mechanism similar to that observed in the regulation of Rho downstream of other protocadherins, such as paraxial protocadherin, may be operative (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chung et al., 2007</a>)."

We assume that the loss of Pcdh20 primarily leads to dysregulation of dendritic morphogenesis, followed by malpositioning of the L4 neurons, which is supported by several lines of evidence. First, <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown in an in vitro culture, where cell positional effects are ignorable, resulted in increased dendritogenesis without altering L4 fate specification. In vivo, Pcdh20- and Dcx double-knockdown neurons tended to exhibit pyramidal morphology even if they were in L4, especially those located near the margin of L4, also suggesting the primary effect, to some extent at least, of Pcdh20 on cell morphology. Regulation of dendritic morphogenesis by another protocadherin was also reported previously (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shima et al., 2004</a>). Second, in the time-course experiment of <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown, we noticed that loss of <i>Pcdh20</i> first affected the dendrite morphology leading to extensive dendritic arborization, when the control cells already started to exhibit simplification of their complex apical primitive dendrites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a>). Finally, active RhoA rescued the malpositioning caused by <i>Pcdh20</i> knockdown with reduced arborization of the apical dendrites of the <i>Pcdh20</i>-knockdown neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Because the arborized dendrites were predominantly found in the MZ, it is possible that the abnormal dendrites might have caused the knockdown neurons to become \u2018stuck\u2019 to the MZ."

However, since the interactions through protocadherins, including Pcdh20, are usually very weak or undetectable (K.O. and K.N. unpublished data), there may be other ligands that activate Pcdh20 to regulate neuronal positioning."

                        "text": "Then, what is the mechanism that gives positional cues to immature L4 neurons to exhibit cell-position-dependent subtype specification? Since the acquisition of the L4-specific characteristics (e.g., simplification of apical dendrites) by the \u201cfuture L4 neurons\u201d coincided with the arrival of the TCAs into the lower part of the CP (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lopez-Bendito and Molnar, 2003</a>), we hypothesized that these axons could positively regulate the L4 identity specification. We demonstrated here that TCAs might be involved in correct subtype specification of L4 neurons by the analysis of TCA-deficient <i>Pcdh10 (OL-pc</i>) knockout mice. The results of other studies also suggested that defects in TCAs misspecify L4 identity (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zhou et al., 2010</a>) and that TCAs instruct the development of modality-specific properties of cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pouchelon et al., 2014</a>). Here, we showed that TCA absence resulted in loss of L4 identity and, surprisingly, instead acquisition of some L2/3 characteristics, which recapitulated the phenotypes observed in <i>Pcdh20</i> or <i>Dcx</i> knockdown, suggesting that TCAs might provide a positional cue to immature L4 neurons. Molecular mechanisms underlying this action still remain to be determined. Although neuronal transmission from TCAs to L4 neurons is an attractive candidate, it may not be required for this action. It was reported that defects in synaptic activity from TCAs to cortical neurons did not appear to be involved in subtype specification of L4 neurons in mice (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hannan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Iwasato et al., 2000</a>). A more recent study showed that complete blockade of thalamocortical neurotransmission resulted in perturbed development of L4 neurons. Initial specification of cortical neurons, however, appeared largely normal (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2013</a>), which occurs through the first week after birth, at the stage when specification failure was already observed in our mouse model."

This suggested that the environment around the immature neurons could also influence the subtype specification of the neurons. Although postmitotic expressions of fate determinants, such as subtype-specific transcription factors, have been observed in the immature CP, it is not known whether these factors are induced intrinsically downstream of the fate determinants in the progenitor cells or in response to the extracellular environment. Therefore, it will be important to examine the role of the environment in the subtype specification of the postmitotic/post-migratory neurons in other contexts."

These previous discrepancies might have been caused by the differences in their experimental conditions. From our new analysis, the DN-RhoA expressing neurons appeared to settle in the ridge of the CP very similarly to normal cells after radial migration, although they could have migrated differently. Therefore, we think that the phenotype observed at P7 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) is most probably due to the event after radial migration is completed by around E18.0 rather than mainly caused by the migration difference."

One might suspect that accelerated neuronal migration could cause premature differentiation, which would result in more cells in deeper layers at P7. This effect of DN-RhoA, if any, was thought to be minor, though. It would be interesting to address this issue in future studies by looking at subtype specification of the cells that migrate much faster than normal cells by some treatment.
