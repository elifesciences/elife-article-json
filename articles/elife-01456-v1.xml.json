Many of the most useful programs have been developed by other scientists (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hannay et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6a\">Morin and Sliz, 2013</a>), but these scientists often have little or no time to support the widespread distribution of their software and/or to provide the support needed to install it on a variety of different hardware devices and operating systems. Consequently, as our reliance on software developed by other scientists increases, so do the costs and burdens of supporting this software. However, if these costs and burdens can be shared, they will fall, access to the software will increase, and new computational resources will emerge."

The \u2018start-up\u2019 phase of an SBGrid-style collaboration would also benefit from a cohort of research laboratories willing to provide an initial investment in foundational resources (e.g. salaries, facilities, etc).

As dependence on computational tools and techniques continue to increase in every field of scientific endeavour, the burdens of supporting research computing for individual researchers, research groups and institutions will also grow. SBGrid is an example of a successful community-based research computing initiative in the field of structural biology. Through the aggregation of resources, pooling of expertise and sharing of costs among its many members, SBGrid is able to lower barriers of entry and expand access to research computing. The SBGrid model is also readily generalizable to other scientific fields of study that rely on research computing, and would be likely to yield similar benefits."
