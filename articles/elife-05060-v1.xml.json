According to this principle, fitness differences between the individuals in a population are an important driving force of evolution. Biologists have long used fitness effects to explain observed evolutionary changes. For good reasons, however, they have been hesitant to make predictions about the future of a species. Given the bewildering complexity of what is possible in evolution, attempting to say what will happen in a specific instance may appear futile. Moreover, we cannot test any predictions, because we have not seen the evolutionary past and will not see the future."

In these systems, high mutation rates make evolution happen in front of our eyes. Every year, for example, the human influenza virus replaces 2% of the amino acids in the protein domains that interact with the immune system of its host. Using modern genome sequencing, we can now monitor the genetic history of entire populations and reconstruct their genealogical trees. Such trees show how the individuals of today's populations are connected to their evolutionary ancestors. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Richard Neher, Colin Russell and Boris Shraiman investigate how much these trees can tell us about the future of a population (<a href=\"#bib6\">Neher et al., 2014</a>)."

From the statistics of the genealogical tree itself, epidemiologists infer the growth rate of pathogen populations and use that information to predict the future course of an epidemic (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Stadler, 2010</a>). Neher, Russell and Shraiman\u2014who are at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, the University of Cambridge, and the University of California at Santa Barbara, respectively\u2014extend this genealogy-based inference to genetic changes within a population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

The basic idea is simple. Given that fitness differences within a population are carried by genetic mutations, we can imagine splitting each mutation and its fitness effect into ever-smaller pieces. This leads to a model in which the overall fitness variation of a population is made up of many small-effect mutations. By the law of large numbers, the fitness distribution then becomes bell-shaped. Such distributions are called travelling fitness waves (<a href=\"#bib10\">Tsimring et al., 1996</a>). In a given lineage, the accumulation of many small fitness effects follows a diffusive random walk. This picture applies to fast adaptive processes in asexual populations where the expansion of a successful clade is fuelled by multiple beneficial mutations\u2014for example, when viruses evolve to escape their hosts' immune defences."

Specifically, they look at the local tree \u2018volume\u2019 <i>\u03bb</i>(<i>\u03c4</i>), which sums all tree branches in the vicinity of a given node with a discounting scale <i>\u03c4</i>. This quantity provides a (nonlinear) measure of how fast the number of individuals grows around that node. For example, in a subtree growing exponentially with rate <i>r</i>, the volume <i>\u03bb</i>(<i>\u03c4</i>) equals simply <i>\u03c4</i>/(1\u2013<i>\u03c4</i><i>r</i>). By interpreting this growth rate as fitness, Neher and colleagues obtain a measure of fitness differences between clades. A substantial fraction of the local tree volume is generated by small-effect mutations \u2018hitch-hiking\u2019 in successful clades (for example synonymous mutations, which do not change a protein). This explains why the local tree volume is closely related to fitness measures used in previous prediction schemes (<a href=\"#bib4\">\u0141uksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014</a>)."

Thus, it can be applied in cases where we do not know which functions undergo adaptive evolution or where in the genome they are encoded. This feature is also important for interpreting the results: genealogy-based inference reveals growth rate differences within a population sample, but it remains agnostic about their cause. In the fitness wave model, adaptive evolution is that cause, but the demographic structure of a population or variations in sampling density may generate a similar signal in tree data."

These \u2018antigenic\u2019 properties determine how effective influenza vaccines are. They depend on a smaller number of mutations, some of which have individually large effects (<a href=\"#bib3\">Koel et al., 2013</a>). Thus, prediction schemes geared towards antigenic properties must go beyond examining the overall sequence genealogies and weigh mutations by their antigenic effect (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bedford et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">\u0141uksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014</a>)."

This poses big conceptual and practical questions: How much can future methods improve on that score? And where does the inherent unpredictability of evolution start? Prediction is the ultimate test of any dynamical principle. Quantitative evolutionary science is being put to that test now."
