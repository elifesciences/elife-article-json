Here, we report on a novel circuit for the propagation of waves of muscle contraction, using the peristaltic locomotion of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae as a model system. We found an intersegmental chain of synaptically connected neurons, alternating excitatory and inhibitory, necessary for wave propagation and active in phase with the wave. The excitatory neurons (A27h) are premotor and necessary only for forward locomotion, and are modulated by stretch receptors and descending inputs. The inhibitory neurons (GDL) are necessary for both forward and backward locomotion, suggestive of different yet coupled central pattern generators, and its inhibition is necessary for wave propagation. The circuit structure and functional imaging indicated that the commands to contract one segment promote the relaxation of the next segment, revealing a mechanism for wave propagation in peristaltic locomotion."

Here, we report on a novel circuit for the propagation of waves of muscle contraction, using the peristaltic locomotion of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae as a model system. We found an intersegmental chain of synaptically connected neurons, alternating excitatory and inhibitory, necessary for wave propagation and active in phase with the wave. The excitatory neurons (A27h) are premotor and necessary only for forward locomotion, and are modulated by stretch receptors and descending inputs. The inhibitory neurons (GDL) are necessary for both forward and backward locomotion, suggestive of different yet coupled central pattern generators, and its inhibition is necessary for wave propagation. The circuit structure and functional imaging indicated that the commands to contract one segment promote the relaxation of the next segment, revealing a mechanism for wave propagation in peristaltic locomotion."

This sequential activation of segmental musculature is generated by segmentally interconnected circuits in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). The basic pattern of motor activity can be observed as fictive locomotion in dissected larvae or in isolated nerve cords, to which localized optogenetic manipulation can be applied (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fox et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kohsaka et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pulver et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the larva also is capable of a variety of other locomotive patterns and can adjust to changes in environmental conditions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Godoy-Herrera, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hwang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vogelstein et al., 2014</a>). Powerful genetic tools, including a resource of GAL4 drivers (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</a>), allow for the\u00a0manipulation of the activity of uniquely identified neurons in this simple nervous system (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Manning et al., 2012</a>). These genetic tools enable optogenetic manipulation and the\u00a0monitoring of neural activity in larvae in the context of mapped circuitry thanks to novel circuit mapping tools (<a href=\"#bib49\">Saalfeld et al., 2009</a>) and an electron microscopy volume of the complete central nervous system of the larva (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>)."

We screened GAL4 driver lines and identified neurons that are active with the peristaltic wave of larval muscle contraction. We then mapped the circuits with synaptic resolution in which these neurons are embedded, and we found a repeating modular circuit formed by an inhibitory (GDL) and an excitatory neuron (A27h) in each hemisegment, connected in a chain across consecutive segments. Using optogenetics and functional imaging, we determined that the inhibitory neuron GDL is necessary for both forward and backward locomotion, but the excitatory neuron A27h is necessary only for forward locomotion, suggesting underlying coupled circuits. Body-wide activation of GDL led to the paralysis of the abdominal segments, but its localized activation in a few consecutive segments was sufficient to arrest the wave of propagation. Taken together, our findings define a mechanism for wave propagation in which the contraction of one segment is concomitant with the relaxation of the adjacent anterior segment, and the cessation of contraction is in turn coupled with the stimulation of contraction in next anterior segment. The logic of this network allows for additional models for coordinated muscle contraction that incorporate feedback from stretch receptors and also descending neurons from the subesophageal zone (SEZ)."

We performed calcium imaging focusing on the dorsomedial region of the VNC where the dendrite of GDLs and the cell bodies of aCCs can be uniquely identified in the same focal plane (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B1, 2</a>). We found GDLs in each segment were activated earlier than aCCs in the same segment and at a similar time as aCCs in the next posterior segment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B3</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Thus, the activity of GDLs propagates along the segments ahead of the wave of motor neuron activity during forward locomotion. This suggests a role for GDLs in relaxing and resetting anterior segments prior to the arrival of the contraction wave."

We observed a significant decrease in the speed of larval locomotion (~30% slower than control, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We also found a significant increase in the wave duration (~40% longer than control, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and a decrease in the number of forward peristaltic waves (~1/5<sup>th</sup> the normal frequency, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The <i>GDL-GAL4</i> is also expressed in a small subset of cells in the brain and SEZ. To test whether inhibition of GDLs alone is responsible for the observed TNT phenotype, we suppressed GAL4 activity in the VNC with <i>tsh-GAL80</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clyne and Miesenbock, 2008</a>). We analyzed the resulting expression pattern by combining <i>GDL-GAL4 and tsh-GAL80</i> and did not observe GAL4 activity in GDLs, however expression in the brain and SEZ remained intact (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The TNT phenotype was rescued with <i>tsh-GAL80</i>, indicating that GDLs, the only <i>GDL-GAL4</i>\u2013expressing neurons in the VNC, were solely responsible for the phenotype (p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). As further proof, we specifically disrupted synaptic transmission in GDLs by disrupting GABA synthesis with RNAi directed against the <i>Glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (Gad1</i>) gene, since other neurons in the <i>GDL-GAL4</i> pattern are not GABAergic (data not shown). RNAi knock-down of <i>Gad1</i> using two independent constructs that target different portions of the <i>Gad1</i> mRNA resulted in a similar increase in wave duration as we observed for TNT-expressing larvae (~40% longer than control, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). These results show that the\u00a0activity of GDLs is required for larvae to crawl at a normal speed and for normal muscle contraction wave frequency. Therefore, GABAergic transmission is critical for the function of GDLs and larval locomotion."

                                "text": "Having identified GDLs as necessary for propagating peristaltic waves, we then studied the neural circuit basis for GDL function. First, we determined that GDLs do not synapse directly onto motor neurons by using GRASP (<a href=\"#bib11\">Feinberg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gordon and Scott, 2009</a>), expressing each half of the GFP protein in GDLs and motor neurons, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To confirm this, we then identified GDLs in an electron microscopy (EM) volume comprising the entire larval CNS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and reconstructed all neurons synaptically connected to GDLs in segment A1, none of which were motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3</a>). We also found that no strongly connected GDL partners synapse with each other, suggesting that GDLs act as hub neurons, with the potential to orchestrate activity patterns of postsynaptic neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). One of the top synaptic GDL partner cell types (by number of synapses), connected both presynaptically (\u201cupstream\u201d) and postsynaptically (\u201cdownstream\u201d), is the segmentally repeated premotor interneuron A27h (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Interestingly, though all the downstream premotor interneurons were found in the same segment as GDLs, all the upstream premotor interneurons were located in the next posterior segment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Furthermore, GDLs receive the inputs from somatosensory neurons (vdaA and vdaC class II dendritic arborization neurons; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) that likely mediate gentle touch (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tsubouchi et al., 2012</a>). Taken together, this arrangement configures a feed-forward circuit in which premotor interneurons of one segment not only drive motor neurons in the same segment but also transmit an inhibitory signal to their own homologs in the adjacent anterior segment via GDLs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), in parallel with a synaptic pathway for sensory feedback that also regulates transmission of the peristaltic wave (see Discussion)."

The depolarizing response was with a very short delay (\u22645\u00a0ms), consistent with the direct synaptic connection shown by the EM reconstruction (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The efficiency with which A27h is capable of driving aCC correlates with the position of A27h presynaptic terminals, near the proximal portion of the aCC axon (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), which is the presumptive spike initiation zone (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gunay et al., 2015</a>). We also recorded the intrinsic activity of A27h and aCC and found that they were synchronized (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>).

We then used a photoactivatable GFP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ruta et al., 2010</a>) and identified the A27h axon within the <i>R36G02-GAL4</i> expression pattern by comparing it to the EM reconstructions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we monitored the activity of A27h neurons and aCC motor neurons during fictive locomotion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We observed a wave-like activity that propagates from posterior to the anterior segments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Interestingly, unlike GDLs that are active during both forward and backward locomotion (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), A27h was activated only during forward locomotion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This suggests that though GDL participates in both forward and backward locomotion, the excitatory neuron A27h is specialized in forward locomotion. We postulate a different premotor neuron acts during backward locomotion and we found a possible candidate for which a genetic driver line does not exist (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and see Discussion)."

To determine the nature of this locomotion blockage, we activated all GDLs by ChR2(T159C) in a semi-intact preparation where we could monitor muscle contractions using mhc::GFP (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</a>). We found that muscles relaxed when all GDLs were active (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), contrary to the whole-body contraction (hunch) normally observed as part of the startle response elicited by blue light (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ohyama et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vogelstein et al., 2014</a>). To exclude that neurons in the <i>GDL-GAL4</i> expression pattern other than GDLs played a role in this muscle relaxation, we used <i>tsh-GAL80</i> to suppress expression in abdominal segments, and this rescued the immobilization phenotype (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). These results were confirmed using optogenetic CsChrimson-mediated activation of GDLs and a different driver line, <i>R15C11-LexA</i>; this resulted in similar phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>)."

In particular, A02j synapses onto the GDLs of the two segments anterior to its own segment, potentially starting the excitatory drive over GDLs to promote the relaxation of segments anterior to the muscle contraction wave. Additionally, A02j synapses directly onto some motor neurons of the segments anterior to its own segment (not shown), with potentially an inhibitory effect as shown in (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kohsaka et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, A02j in one segment might promote the disinhibition of its anterior homologs, given than GDL, a GABAergic neuron, synapses onto a segment-local putatively GABAergic neuron (A31d; similar morphology and belonging to the same lineage as the GABAergic neurons A31b and A31k [<a href=\"#bib50\">Schneider-Mizell et al., in press</a>]). (<b>B</b>) The GDL-A27h circuit interacts with neurons known to affect the speed of locomotion (PMSIs and GVLIs). A02d is a PMSI neuron (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kohsaka et al., 2014</a>) that receives inputs from GDL and in turn synapses onto the A08a neuron (a GVLI; [<a href=\"#bib25\">Itakura et al., 2015</a>]). A08a, in turn, synapses onto two putatively GABAergic neurons (A31d and A31x). This circuit suggests that GDL prevents A02d from driving A08a, which could potentially underlie the observed activation pattern of A08a, which is active two segments posterior to the forward-moving peristaltic wave (<a href=\"#bib25\">Itakura et al., 2015</a>). We did not observe synapses between A08a and motor neurons. Furthermore, GDL might provide inhibition ipsilaterally to the contralaterally projecting, Eve-Skipped+ neuron A08e3, which is necessary for maintaining bilaterally symmetric muscle contraction amplitude (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heckscher et al., 2015</a>). This suggests a role for GDL in the regulation of posture adjustment, and therefore a close relationship between the circuits for wave propagation and the circuits for ensuring symmetrical muscle contractions in forward locomotion.

This circuit consists of a chain of alternating excitatory and inhibitory neurons spanning all abdominal segments. The core elements of the chain include just one excitatory and one inhibitory neuron per hemisegment. We demonstrate here that the inhibitory neuron (GDL) is sufficient to halt the peristalsis and to relax muscles in all segments, suggesting it is a point of coordination between forward and backward locomotion. We further demonstrate that the excitatory neuron (A27h) is active during forward but not backward peristalsis, suggesting the existence of another excitatory circuit component critical for backward peristalsis among the synaptic partners of the GDL inhibitory neuron. This circuit defines a backbone of repeating, connected, modules for excitation and inhibition similar to those postulated in a computational model for peristalsis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gjorgjieva et al., 2013</a>) on the basis of behavioral observations that predicted the existence of central pattern generators (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suster and Bate, 2002</a>)."

This suggests an explanation for the observation that in forward crawling, dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscles contract simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heckscher et al., 2012</a>). In backward peristalsis, however, a phase gap has been observed in the timing of dorsal and ventral muscle contraction (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heckscher et al., 2012</a>). This decoupling could require a more complex circuit structure for backward wave propagation, and therefore suggests an explanation for the lack of an equivalent excitatory neuron in the circuit chain for backward peristalsis. We found, however, neurons postsynaptic to the inhibitory neuron (GDL) whose anatomy and position in the circuit suggest a role in backward peristalsis (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, the inhibitory neuron (GDL) itself does not synapse onto motor neurons, and therefore occupies a higher-order position in the circuit that allows its participation in both forward and backward wave propagation in peristalsis. Furthermore, the GDL axon targets the intermediate lateral neuropil, which is neither in the domain of motor neuron dendrites nor in the somatosensory domain, suggestive of a role higher-order motor coordination. Relevant for forward peristalsis, GDL disinhibits the excitation of its anterior homologs, by removing inhibition from a glutamatergic interneurons (A02j) implicated in the regulation of peristaltic speed (one of the PMSIs; [<a href=\"#bib27\">Kohsaka et al., 2014</a>]). A02j is presynaptic to GDLs in anterior segments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

Though we found that the chain of alternating inhibitory and excitatory neurons runs independently on the left and right sides of the body, the excitatory neuron (A27h) presents a bilateral arbor and drives motor neurons bilaterally. Our wiring diagram best supports a model of left-right coordination where excitatory neurons communicate with each other (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gjorgjieva et al., 2013</a>), but with the caveat that this synergy takes place by the simultaneous co-activation of the target motor neurons rather than reciprocal excitation. This model has been shown to support longer contraction episodes at the front of the wave (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gjorgjieva et al., 2013</a>), consistent with observations of muscle contraction in peristalsis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heckscher et al., 2012</a>). Independently of the timing, the fine-tuning in the intensity of left-right contractions has been shown to be under control of Even-skipped+ evolutionarily conserved neurons, which integrate both proprioceptive inputs and motor commands (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heckscher et al., 2015</a>)."

These waves occur in the absence of sensory feedback, indicating the presence of CPGs and also suggesting a role for sensory feedback in speeding up the peristaltic wave (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suster and Bate, 2002</a>). The circuit chain of excitatory and inhibitory neurons described here could be a part of the CPG, and we additionally found these neurons are modulated by proprioceptive inputs (from vpda class I dendritic arborization neuron; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Given that the vpda is a stretch receptor (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tamarkin and Levine, 1996</a>), it would be active in the segment ahead of the wave of contraction, which is being stretched by the pull exerted by the contracting segment (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Proprioceptive feedback action onto the excitatory neuron of the circuit chain could then have two simultaneous effects: promotion of the contraction in the segment ahead of the wave (via activation of A27h), and relaxation of the segment twice removed (via activation of GDL, which acts on the segment anterior to it; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We also found two somatosensory neurons (vdaA and vdaC) synapse axo-dendritically onto the premotor excitatory neuron (A27h) and axo-axonically onto the inhibitory neuron (GDL) in their own segment (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Although the function of these two sensory neurons remains unclear, we speculate that this axo-axonic, likely depolarizing, connection onto GDL reduces the membrane action potential of its axon, reducing synaptic release of GABA onto A27h in the same segment (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burrows and Matheson, 1994</a>). Our model refines a previous model where the proprioceptive feedback was thought to signal the successful contraction of a segment (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</a>). We suggest that, in addition, at least some of the proprioceptive feedback (vpda) facilitates wave propagation and, therefore, may underlie the reduction in speed observed in fictive crawling (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fox et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pulver et al., 2009</a>)."

One interneuron (A08e3) is an Even-Skipped+ neuron that maintains left-right symmetric muscle contraction amplitude (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heckscher et al., 2015</a>). The other (A02d) is a glutamatergic interneuron that belongs to a lineage of neurons thought to mediate speed of locomotion (one of the PMSIs; [<a href=\"#bib27\">Kohsaka et al., 2014</a>]). While A02d is a segment-local interneuron, proprioceptive axons span multiple segments (<a href=\"#bib39\">Merritt and Whitington, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schneider-Mizell et al., in press</a>), suggesting that a GDL can suppresses the effect of proprioceptive feedback specifically within its own segment without affecting the relay of proprioception to adjacent segments. Furthermore, A02d synapses onto a glutamatergic interneuron (A08a) thought to contribute to muscle relaxation in the wake of the peristaltic wave (<a href=\"#bib25\">Itakura et al., 2015</a>), which could be mediated via putative GABAergic premotor neurons (A31d; <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

The brain and SEZ have been deemed non-essential for wave propagation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berni et al., 2012</a>). Speed of wave propagation, therefore, may be controlled in at least two ways: by proprioceptive feedback and by descending inputs. The existence of a circuit chain formed by excitatory and inhibitory neurons might be all that remains when both sensory feedback and the brain are absent, explaining the existence of wave propagation in decerebrated animals (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berni et al., 2012</a>), and even for a small set of isolated abdominal segments (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pulver et al., 2015</a>)."

We excised the sequence between the HindIII(6488) and XbaI(8490) sites of pJFRC2-INS (Plasmid #26215) and replaced with the sites of <i>pJFRC7-20XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP</i> (Plasmid #26220, XbaI(8740) and HindIII(6488), 4*5xGAL4_DBD). Then, we replaced the sites between XhoI(7341) and XbaI(8740) with <i>Drosophila</i> codon-optimized ChR2(T159C)::YFP synthesized by Biobasic inc. We next excised the sequence between the HindIII and PacI sites of the plasmid and amplified by PCR using primers 5-AgeI (CATGCGCACCGGTGGCCAGGGCCGCAAG) and 3-KpnI (CACTTGGTACCTGGCCATTAATTAAGGCCGGCC). The resulting construct was used to transform <i>y[1] w[67c23]; P(CaryP)</i> attP40 or attP2 sites as described above."

For manual analysis, wandering third instar larvae were gently washed in deionized water and then placed on an agar plate. After acclimation (3\u2009min), the movements of the larvae were videotaped under a microscope (SZX16, Olympus, Japan) using an XCD-V60 CCD camera (30 frames/sec for 30 s) and the movies were downloaded into VFS-42 (Vision Freezer, Chori imaging). The wave duration, which is elapsed time between the landing of the posterior end and elongation of the head, was manually measured in the movies using Fiji (10 waves per larva). The frequency of larval locomotion (number of forward waves) was also manually calculated by dividing the total number of forward waves of each larva by the total time."

In spite of its outstanding genetic advantages, in the realm of locomotor circuits the fly had lagged seriously behind other model organisms in which electrophysiology allowed circuit mapping. For many years investigators had to satisfy themselves with access only to the motor neuron effectors. In the last couple years, there has been a wave of papers implicating a few specific interneurons in locomotion, but nothing that gave a big picture of how the circuit worked. The breakthrough here is the marriage of the EM level anatomy with physiology and imaging. This is a well-designed pioneering work that elucidates fine-mechanisms of wave propagation in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. In addition, it paves the way to the genetic and anatomical dissection of the CPG on a scale never approached before."

Both the crayfish and the <i>Drosophila</i> larva employ a mode of locomotion that utilizes forward waves of motor neuron commands. In our manuscript we report on how the contraction of the current segment induces the relaxation of the anterior segment in forward peristalsis, with potentially the bulk of the forward excitation being provided by proprioceptive feedback as described elsewhere. On the other hand, the model shown in Zhang et al. (2014) reports on a network where the oscillator module of the CPG responsible for the swimmeret\u2019s return strokes in each segment elicits the return strokes of the segment anterior to it, which is permitted only when the oscillator for the power strokes in that anterior segment ceases to inhibit the oscillator for the return strokes. While fascinating, we were unable to draw specific parallels between the crayfish oscillator-based abstract model and the EM-reconstructed larval circuit regarding motor wave propagation. Interestingly, the circuit diagrams in the crayfish, in particular the coordination between the two CPGs for power strokes and return strokes perhaps are reminiscent of the coordination between longitudinal and transverse muscles in <i>Drosophila</i> larva as described by Heckscher et al. 2012, which falls beyond the scope of our manuscript."
