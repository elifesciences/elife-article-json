CNA number and length are linked to patient survival, suggesting clinical relevance. We have identified genes that tend to be mutated in samples that have few or many CNAs, which we term CONIM genes (COpy Number Instability Modulators). CONIM proteins cluster into a densely connected subnetwork of physical interactions and many of them are epigenetic modifiers. Therefore, we investigated how the epigenome of the tissue-of-origin influences the position of CNA breakpoints and the properties of the resulting CNAs. We found that the presence of heterochromatin in the tissue-of-origin contributes to the recurrence and length of CNAs in the respective cancer type."

CNA number and length are linked to patient survival, suggesting clinical relevance. We have identified genes that tend to be mutated in samples that have few or many CNAs, which we term CONIM genes (COpy Number Instability Modulators). CONIM proteins cluster into a densely connected subnetwork of physical interactions and many of them are epigenetic modifiers. Therefore, we investigated how the epigenome of the tissue-of-origin influences the position of CNA breakpoints and the properties of the resulting CNAs. We found that the presence of heterochromatin in the tissue-of-origin contributes to the recurrence and length of CNAs in the respective cancer type."

These CNAs arise when breaks in the DNA are repaired incorrectly, leading to some pieces of DNA being multiplied while others are lost. Ultimately, CNAs contribute to cancer growth either by providing extra copies of genes that drive tumour development or by deleting genes that normally protect against cancer."

Furthermore, we do not know why some cancer types are associated with many CNAs and other types with only a few. This is partly due to the fact that CNAs tend to affect several genes at the same time [in the dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; <a href=\"http://cancergenome.nih.gov/\">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</a>) used in this analysis, 59 genes on average\u00a0are affected by a single CNA]. Therefore, it is often difficult to tell whether, and on which of the genes in the amplified or deleted region, selection is acting. In\u00a0addition, cancer samples usually carry a much lower number of CNAs (on average 46 CNAs in the patient samples considered in this study) than\u00a0single nucleotide variants (SNVs; usually 10.000s per cancer genome). The sparse number of CNAs hinders the detection of statistical associations between CNAs and genetic and epigenetic features, work that has previously been carried\u00a0out for SNVs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schuster-B\u00f6ckler and Lehner, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Polak et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Supek and Lehner, 2015</a>)."

Authors have reported\u00a0that\u00a0CNA breakpoints are preferentially located in close proximity to DNA-methylation-depleted G-quadruplex sequences (<a href=\"#bib10\">De and Michor, 2011</a>). This suggests that DNA secondary structure contributes to the CNA distribution. In\u00a0addition, CNAs that\u00a0are\u00a0close to telomeres are longer than those found in internal regions. This suggests that there are several different mechanisms of CNA generation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zack et al., 2013</a>). It has also been observed that DNA contact points in genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (HiC) proximity maps are more likely to become CNA breakpoints. Thus, the length distribution of CNAs reflects chromosomal interactions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fudenberg et al., 2011</a>). The observation that certain genes tend to be mutated in CNA-rich (TP53 and SPOP [<a href=\"#bib8\">Ciriello et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boysen et al., 2015</a>]) or CNA-poor (CTCF and ARID1A [<a href=\"#bib8\">Ciriello et al., 2013</a>]) cancers implies that, besides epigenetic factors, the genetic background of the cell influences CNA variation."

It has been\u00a0shown previously\u00a0that cancer\u00a0cells that have\u00a0undergone whole genome duplications are associated with higher CNA rates (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zack et al., 2013</a>) and poor prognosis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dewhurst et al., 2014</a>), thus we removed aneuploid samples. As CNA numbers have been linked to mutation rate (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ciriello et al., 2013</a>), we additionally excluded highly mutated samples. We observed that for five of the 19 cancer types (brca, lgg, hnsc, paad and ucec) for which we had CNA and survival data, fewer CNAs were significantly associated with a longer survival period (p &lt; 0.05; chi-square test; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> as an example).

We corrected for potential confounding factors such as tumor-type- and gene-specific alteration rates (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We applied our pipeline to a pan-cancer set consisting of 5,734 samples from 20 different cancer types (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods).

Their fraction among CONIM genes is higher than expected by chance (p &lt; e-16; chi-square test). We contemplated whether mutations in the remaining 48 genes contribute to the progression of the cancer or are just a by-product of the increased mutation rates found in cancer cells. Accordingly, we used functional impact scores to estimate the pathogenicity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kircher et al., 2014</a>) of the mutations found in CONIM genes that\u00a0had\u00a0not been\u00a0previously implicated in cancer progression. The scores were compared to those of mutations found in genes that have an equal missense mutation frequency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We found that mutations in CONIM genes have, on average, a stronger functional impact than those in genes not associated with a change in CNA number. To estimate the temporal order of somatic events, we compared the variant allele fractions (VAFs) of mutations in non-cancer CONIM genes to the VAFs of mutations from equally often mutated genes. We found that in two out of five cancer types tested, mutations in CONIM genes were associated with a lower VAF (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

When comparing the positions relative to the chromosome end, we did not detect any differences between breakpoints in H3K9me3-enriched and H3K9me3-depleted genomic windows (p\u00a0=\u00a00.8; Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test). Additionally, we tested the effect of excluding breakpoints located within 1 Mb or 10 Mb of the chromosome ends. Both tests re-confirmed significant differences in the length distributions of the two CNA groups (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.005; Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test).

One explanation for this observation could be that mutations in CONIM genes tend to occur late during cancer development.

When many alterations have already been accumulated, high proliferation rates increase the risk of further damage which \u2013 at this point \u2013 would be detrimental to the cancer. The exception is TP53, which is associated with a higher number of CNAs when mutated. Inactivation of TP53 decreases sensitivity to apoptosis, and therefore more DNA damage (including CNAs) is tolerated."

The CNA-rich group has been associated with recurrent mutations in TP53 and the mutation-rich (and CNA-depleted) group with mutations in ARID1A and CTCF. These three genes are also in our CONIM gene list. Several other studies investigated relations between point mutations and CNA numbers in single cancer types: a higher number of CNAs has been reported in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boysen et al., 2015</a>). Lower CNA numbers have been detected in CASP8-mutated oral squamous cell carcinoma (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pickering et al., 2013</a>) and in\u00a0CTNNB1-mutated endometrial cancer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kandoth et al., 2013</a>). Unlike CASP8 and CTNNB1,\u00a0which are part of our CONIM list, SPOP did not pass our pan-cancer CNA enrichment filter criteria because the effect of SPOP on CNAs is highly cancer-type-specific. However, SPOP was recovered by our cancer-type-specific alternative detection pipeline (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Our study goes beyond these previous studies by also considering the influence on CNA occurrence\u00a0of the epigenome in the tissue from which the cancer originated."

We also tested\u00a0whether\u00a0a gene that\u00a0is\u00a0associated with an elevated point mutation rate would automatically end up in our CONIM gene list due to the inverse relation between CNA and mutation counts.

To test whether the observed number of PPIs between CONIM proteins and the size of the largest connected component (the subnetwork in which every pair of proteins is connected by paths through the network) were larger than expected by chance, we performed a randomisation test. We randomly sampled 1,000 protein sets of size equal to that of the CONIM protein set by replacing each CONIM protein by a protein of the same degree (forming as many interactions as the replaced protein). This approach avoids an overestimate of connectivity statistics due to highly interacting proteins in the original protein set.

First, we designed an approach that primes cancer-type-specific CONIM genes high. To diminish the impact of variation in mutation frequency, we removed highly mutated samples (more than two standard deviations away from the median \u2013 affecting 167 samples). We then computed the significant deviation in CNA number for each cancer type separately. As before, we removed genes that show an association with CNA number when considering only silent mutations. A resulting 25 genes had a FDR\u00a0corrected Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon p-value below 0.01\u2013 and\u00a010\u00a0of\u00a0those were associated with a higher CNA number (TP53 again with the strongest effect).

Applying the initial CONIM detection pipeline to this dataset revealed a smaller number of only three genes (TP53, ARID1A and PTEN) fully contained in the initial CONIM set and the cancer-type-specific CONIM gene set.

In each permutation, we computed the absolute difference in the mean CNA number between samples with and without non-silent mutations in the respective gene as a test statistic. We performed 1,000 permutations and computed an empirical p-value as the fraction of times in which the absolute CNA difference was larger than the observed difference in the original data. As before, we included only genes with at least 60 mutations in the 20 cancer types considered.

The analysis is only based on seven cancer types with one, ovarian cancer, manually excluded for being an outlier so there are concerns related to the robustness of this result. Is there are any justification for treating ovarian cancer separately? Since ovarian cancer has frequent TP53 mutations, the question was raised as to whether TP53-mutatant cancers exhibit the same relations between heterochromatin and CNA burden. It is also not clear why additional cell types with matched epigenomes listed in Table S2 and in the methods were not included in the analysis. It should be established that the relationship still holds when considering additional cell types. Also it should be clarified how in some cases the reference epigenome for the cancer type was selected when there was multiple matching ones and establish that the results are robust to that selection. For instance epigenome E061 was used for Foreskin Melanocyte Primary Cells, but there exists another reference epigenomes (E059) in the same cell type for a different individual that was not used."

This may be because the authors used a linear regression model to control for varying CNA rates, whereas the relation may be non-linear and indeed appears so in Ciriello et al. The method I indicated previously should not have such an issue. This method was to control for CNA rates as per Ding et al. Nature 2008 in their analysis of lung adenocarcinomas. In this, they simply permute mutations in any gene across samples, while maintaining overall mutation rates in that sample. For instance, if one has a list of mutations as: column 1: sample id, column 2: mutated gene in that sample, one could simply permute the second column. These permutations would form a background model against which one could compare observed data to generate p-values.\""

The method I indicated previously should not have such an issue. This method was to control for CNA rates as per Ding et al. Nature 2008 in their analysis of lung adenocarcinomas. In this, they simply permute mutations in any gene across samples, while maintaining overall mutation rates in that sample. For instance, if one has a list of mutations as: column 1: sample id, column 2: mutated gene in that sample, one could simply permute the second column.

We decided to stay with the previous pipeline given the overlap between the previous pipeline and the one suggested by the reviewer. Also, they share similar properties with respect to functional and interaction enrichment as well as the ratio between genes associated with higher and those associated with lower CNA counts. Instead, we discuss the different pipelines and sources of the variability between them in the Discussion section. However, if the reviewer insists we would be willing to change the manuscript and present ours and the permutation-based approach as the main pipelines."

We again observed elevated mutation frequencies in cancer types that correspond to H3K9me3-enriched tissues.

We just want to illustrate with this comparison that CNA number and length are not independent. However, we agree that it is confusing that the overlap is higher than the previously stated total number of CONIM genes. We therefore clarify that we did not filter at the respective position in the revised manuscript."
