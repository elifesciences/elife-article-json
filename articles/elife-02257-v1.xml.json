Here, we investigate this question by exploring the cytosolic state of integrin-adhesome components and their dynamic exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol. Using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) we found that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled already in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Stationary focal adhesions release symmetrically the same types of protein complexes that they recruit, thereby keeping the cytosolic pool of building blocks spatiotemporally uniform. We conclude a model in which multi-protein building blocks enable rapid and modular self-assembly of adhesion sites and symmetric exchange of these building blocks preserves their specifications and thus the assembly logic of the system."

Here, we investigate this question by exploring the cytosolic state of integrin-adhesome components and their dynamic exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol. Using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) we found that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled already in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Stationary focal adhesions release symmetrically the same types of protein complexes that they recruit, thereby keeping the cytosolic pool of building blocks spatiotemporally uniform. We conclude a model in which multi-protein building blocks enable rapid and modular self-assembly of adhesion sites and symmetric exchange of these building blocks preserves their specifications and thus the assembly logic of the system."

These can make the construction of cell-matrix adhesion sites quicker and more accurate by reducing the number of steps in the self-assembly process. In addition, under most circumstances, these building blocks do not change when they are exchanged between the cytosol and the adhesion site: this means that they can be re-used repeatedly and accurately. The work of Hoffmann et al. also raises questions about whether similar principles govern the self-assembly of other large intracellular multi-protein structures."

Upon local signals, components of the integrin adhesome get self-assembled along the plasma membrane to form nascent adhesion sites and to further mature them to focal complexes and focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cukierman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gardel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zaidel-Bar and Geiger, 2010</a>). These adhesion sites assemble, disassemble, and change their molecular content by exchanging their components with the surrounding cytosol (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wolfenson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lavelin et al., 2013</a>). Likewise, stationary adhesion sites are dynamically maintained by a balanced rapid exchange of constituents with the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lele et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wolfenson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lavelin et al., 2013</a>). Considering the molecular diversity and complexity of cell-matrix adhesion sites (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zamir et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cukierman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Zamir et al., 2008</a>), a major question is how can the integrin adhesome form these structures rapidly, locally, and correctly. In order to approach this question it is essential to consider and examine not only the adhesion sites themselves but also the state of their components in the cytosolic pool. However, the study of this fundamental aspect was largely abandoned so far, due to tacitly conceiving the cytosolic pool as a passive supply of individual integrin adhesome proteins. In this work we challenged this view by systematic FCCS and FRAP measurements. Strikingly, we found that the integrin adhesome is actually extensively pre-assembled already in the cytosol, forming multi-protein building blocks that can facilitate rapid and modular assembly of adhesion sites. The physical associations between adhesion site components are spatially uniform around stationary focal adhesions, indicating that these sites exchange their building blocks with the cytosol without altering them (i.e., symmetrically). Together, our results lead to a concept in which self-assembly of adhesion sites involves recruitment of multi-protein modules and symmetric exchange preserves the specifications of these building blocks in the cytosolic pool, thereby facilitating correct self-assembly."

To address this question we selected 13 key components of adhesion sites\u2014\u03b1-actinin, \u03b1-parvin, p130CAS (CAS), CSK, FAK, ILK, paxillin, PINCH, talin, tensin, VASP, vinculin, and zyxin\u2014and quantified systematically all 91 possible pairwise physical associations between them in the cytosol of REF52 cells using FCCS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The sensitivity of FCCS enabled to perform these measurements at low concentrations of ectopically expressed proteins, comparable to the range of typical endogenous concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The obtained data was analyzed to derive for each measurement the association score, which weights the cross-correlation amplitude by its noise, and the apparent <i>Ka</i> that considers also the auto-correlation curves to quantify the apparent association strength (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The overall distribution of the association scores was skewed to the right as compared to the negative-control measurements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, top), indicating the presence of physical associations between some of the analyzed proteins in the cytosol. These positive measurements resulted from a subset of the 91 protein pairs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Among the 91 possible pairing combinations, 18 protein pairs were found to be physically associated with a p-value &lt;0.0001 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Among these pairs, 15 pairs were found to be physically associated also in the cytosol of another cell line, NIH3T3, with a p-value &lt;0.02 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). These results show a strikingly extensive degree of physical associations between adhesion site components in the cytosol. This indicates that the assembly of adhesion sites is plausibly carried out by recruitment of pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks, rather than of individual proteins."

These concentrations were derived by fitting the red and green autocorrelation curves to a single component diffusion model and dividing the obtained number of particles by the red and green confocal volumes (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). For comparison, the range of typical endogenous concentrations of signalling proteins (<a href=\"#bib24\">Moran et al., 2010</a>) is indicated on the top. Since each integrin adhesome protein typically has multiple different interactions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007</a>), many of them mutually exclusive, the total concentration of all endogenous proteins competing on a given measured A-B association can be approximated as the average of typical endogenous concentrations in cells multiplied by the number of the different competing proteins. This total concentration is therefore considerably larger than the concentrations of the ectopically expressed proteins, as the later ones are within the typical range of single endogenous proteins. Therefore, a given increase in the concentrations of A and B will be distributed over the multiple different competing endogenous proteins. This considerably reduces the sensitivity of the complex concentration to a given elevation of the total levels of its components. The combination of this buffering effect and the low ectopic expression levels minimizes the alteration of the levels of the measured complexes in comparison to non-transfected cells."

Therefore we sought to assess the size of protein complexes formed by the integrin adhesome in the cytosol. If a given high-order protein complex exists, then each pair of its components is expected to exhibit a pairwise physical association. Accordingly, by searching for fully intra-connected sub-graphs in the measured network of pairwise physical associations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), two potential ternary complexes can be inferred: an ILK-PINCH-\u03b1-parvin complex, which was indeed reported as a ternary complex (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wu, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Legate et al., 2006</a>), and a CAS-FAK-paxillin complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Notably, there is no complex containing more than three of the analyzed proteins. This indicates that despite the abundant multivalent interactions in the integrin adhesome network, its cytosolic complexes are considerably confined due to mutual-exclusiveness between protein interactions and allosteric regulations. For example, paxillin was found to be physically associated with vinculin and FAK, however, no association was found between vinculin and FAK (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,G</a>). This suggests that the associations of vinculin and FAK with paxillin are mutually exclusive and therefore a ternary FAK-paxillin-vinculin complex cannot be formed. This inferred mutual exclusive relation is consistent with studies reporting that common sites along paxillin mediate its interactions with FAK and vinculin (<a href=\"#bib32\">Turner and Miller, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Brown et al., 1996</a>). Similarly, our results suggest mutual exclusiveness between the associations of VASP with zyxin, \u03b1-actinin, and vinculin and between the associations of zyxin with VASP and CAS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). We postulate that the size-confinement of cytosolic complexes reflects a system-level design of interdependencies between protein interactions throughout the integrin adhesome network to prevent stochastic assembly of aberrant large complexes."

In such a case, each two physically associated proteins should exhibit similar dwell time and mobile fraction in adhesion sites, since they are part of only one, same, type of building block (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To test this, we measured the mobile fraction and dwell time (<i>\u03c4</i><sub>1/2</sub>) of the 13 proteins in focal adhesions by FRAP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C,E,F</a>) and quantified the difference in dynamics (co-dynamics distance) between each two proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Plotting these co-dynamics distances vs the association scores indicated some protein pairs as prominent building blocks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), including ILK-\u03b1-parvin, ILK-PINCH and \u03b1-parvin-PINCH (reflecting the trimetric ILK-PINCH-\u03b1-parvin complex) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wu, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Legate et al., 2006</a>), paxillin-vinculin, CAS-FAK, VASP-zyxin, and \u03b1-actinin-VASP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>).

However, besides the abovementioned exceptions, our results indicate that in general physical associations in the cytosol do not necessarily imply similarity in dynamics in adhesion sites.

Some of the analyzed proteins can be classified into three groups based on their function and their reported vertical position across focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</a>). Accordingly, FAK and paxillin are located in the integrin-signalling layer, vinculin is in the force transduction layer and zyxin, VASP, and \u03b1-actinin are in the actin regulation layer (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Superimposing this information with the physical associations found in the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) shows that such associations occur only between proteins from the same functional group and vertical layer, or between proteins from adjacent vertical layers without including any other analyzed protein in the complex. For example, paxillin and vinculin are physically associated in the cytosol but they do not contain FAK or VASP in their common building block (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>).

We pose here two alternative models for the mode of this exchange\u2014symmetric and asymmetric (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In a symmetric exchange, proteins exit from adhesion sites with the same state they had upon entering these sites, while in an asymmetric exchange they exit in a different state, termed herein a primed state. This priming can be any change in the post-translational modifications or interactions of the exiting components. The primed state is expected to be unstable in the cytosolic environment, since otherwise it would have been the characteristic state of the protein in the pool. Therefore, an asymmetric exchange, but not a symmetric exchange, would generate a spatial gradient of primed components emanating from adhesion sites. Noteworthy, both symmetric and asymmetric exchanges allow for a spatiotemporal steady state between adhesion sites and cytosol. However, only an asymmetric exchange enables one adhesion site to affect another one, or itself, via the primed components that it releases to the cytosol. An asymmetric exchange would also generate a locally heterogeneous cloud of building blocks around adhesion sites, which may pose an engineering challenge for ensuring correct self-assembly and maintenance of these sites. In contrast, a symmetric exchange ensures a spatially uniform pool of building blocks for adhesion sites and prevents any communication between these sites via primed components."

Combining the FCCS measurements with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of four protein pairs, we found indeed that the physical associations near focal adhesions are correlated with their associations far from focal adhesions regardless of their interaction state in focal adhesions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>). These results indicate that there are no spatial gradients of different (i.e., primed) protein complexes around focal adhesions, indicating that stationary focal adhesions release the same types of complexes that they recruited."

Therefore, we further tested whether tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in adhesion sites, such as FAK, paxillin, and CAS (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) are recruited and released in different phosphorylation states. To monitor tyrosine phosphorylation in live cells we used a biosensor consisting of two SH2 domains, dSH2, tagged with a fluorescent protein (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kirchner et al., 2003</a>). This reporter is enriched in focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kirchner et al., 2003</a>), where it also exhibits FRET with FAK, paxillin, and CAS (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The association scores of all three proteins with dSH2 show no significant difference between the near and far locations, indicating that there is no detectable spatial gradient in the phosphorylation level of paxillin, CAS, and FAK around focal adhesions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J,K</a>). Noteworthy, inhibition of phosphatases by vanadate increases the association scores between dSH2 and CAS, paxillin and FAK, indicating the capability of the assay to detect changes in phosphorylation levels of proteins in the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>). Together, these results support the model of symmetric material exchange for stationary focal adhesions. Accordingly, stationary focal adhesions do not alter the cytosolic pool of building blocks and do not communicate or interfere with nearby adhesion sites via primed components."

Our results further indicate that these building blocks are size-confined (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and are predominantly corresponding to the functional layers across focal adhesions of anchoring and integrin regulation, force transduction, and actin regulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 4</a>). In the cytosol, the building blocks cannot form bigger structures due to dependencies between protein interactions. We propose that at the plasma membrane the system can get locally switched on to self-assemble adhesion sites by passing through checkpoints that induce additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). These checkpoints include mechanical stabilization of the active conformation of matrix-anchored integrin by actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib25\">Puklin-Faucher and Sheetz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gardel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Shattil et al., 2010</a>), activation of proteins (e.g., vinculin) at the plasma membrane by phosphatidyl-inositol-4-5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gilmore and Burridge, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</a>), and mechanical stretching of proteins (e.g., talin and CAS) by actomyosin contractility (<a href=\"#bib27\">Riveline et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Sawada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Johnson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">del Rio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Puklin-Faucher and Sheetz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gardel et al., 2010</a>). Since adhesion sites are self-assembled structures, a standardized pool of building blocks is essential for their correct and efficient assembly. Symmetric material exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol satisfies this requirement by ensuring that building blocks will enter and exit adhesion sites without being altered."

In the cytosol, the pre-assembled building blocks cannot further assemble to form bigger structures due to mutual exclusiveness between protein interactions and allosteric regulations. On the plasma membrane, the system can get locally switched on to assemble an adhesion site by passing through checkpoints that enable additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome. These checkpoints include anchoring of integrins to the extracellular matrix, mechanical stretching of proteins like talin and CAS by actomyosin contractility, and activation of proteins like vinculin and talin by PIP2 on the plasma membrane.

A previous study reported that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts FAK and vinculin associate with paxillin very close to disassembling focal adhesions but not far away from them (<a href=\"#bib6\">Digman et al., 2009</a>). This study was based on a spatially resolved FCCS technique that gains spatial information on the expense of the sampling rate and integration time spent on each location, hence on the expense of the signal-to-noise ratio. This might underlie the difference from our results, which show the presence of FAK-paxillin and vinculin-paxillin associations far away from focal adhesions in REF52 and NIH3T3 cells. Yet, this study (<a href=\"#bib6\">Digman et al., 2009</a>) importantly indicates a gradient in association strengths between these proteins emanating from disassembling focal adhesions, supporting in this case the asymmetric material exchange model. Asymmetric material exchange by disassembling focal adhesions can enable their rapid destruction by breaking them up to relatively bigger pieces, as well as be a mechanism by which they can affect other adhesion sites."

This has implications for broad aspects of cell-matrix adhesion sites formation and regulation. Multi-protein building blocks, in comparison to single-protein building blocks, reduce the number of steps required for self-assembly of adhesion sites. With a properly designed regulation, such a reduction of steps can make the self-assembly of adhesion sites less sensitive to stochastic biochemical noise and therefore also faster. The regulation of adhesion sites assembly should cope with the combinatorial diversity of the building blocks. Since each protein can be a component of different building blocks, this regulation should consider each building block as a whole rather than its constituting proteins as individuals. Otherwise, the self-assembly process would lose control on the identity of the co-recruited proteins when recruiting a protein embedded in a multi-protein building block and thereby will be drifted to form aberrant structures. In order to understand such assembly logic of adhesion sites, it would be important to integrate interaction-dependencies across the integrin adhesome (<a href=\"#bib18\">K\u00f6ster et al., 2012</a>) and to comprehensively characterize the diversity of its high-order protein complexes in the cytosol by combining advanced optical and proteomic approaches (<a href=\"#bib13\">Heinze et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jain et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ridgeway et al., 2012</a>)."

After the tenth frame, the fluorescence of a complete, single focal adhesion was bleached by 30 pulses of 100% laser intensity over a period of 1\u20132 s and image acquisition continued for a period of at least 180 s. The bleaching of a complete adhesion sites was done in order to ensure that the fluorescence recovery is due to exchange of material between adhesion sites and cytosol and not with unbleached parts within the adhesion site itself. Therefore, in different FRAP experiments the size of the bleached area was different.

These cells were hit with a hammer: 100uM of Y-drug for 30-60 minutes. This is problematic for two reasons. First, inhibition of contractility like this is not representative of the physiological mechanism of adhesion disassembly. Adhesions likely disassemble due to actions of calpain on FA proteins. Second, with this high concentration of drug, which is generally used an order of magnitude more dilute, for such a long treatment time, adhesions would be disassembled within 10 minutes. The cytosolic pool likely represents a new steady-state, not the state of recent post-disassembly, as conjectured by the authors. In addition, the length of treatment time also likely induces more plieotropic effects such as complete disassembly of stress fibers and changes in post-translational modification of all kinds proteins that are regulated by contractility-dependent mechano-signalling. I think to perform this experiment properly would require doing analysis at different time points after the addition of different concentrations of drug, finding the interesting candidates, and comparing this to what happens to these candidates in normal adhesions as they are disassembling by endogenously regulated pathways.

So far this aspect was rather neglected and the cytosolic pool was tacitly conceived as a collection of individual proteins. Conceptually, this work implies that adhesion sites assembly is a process involving in multi-protein complexes as the elementary building blocks. Multi-protein building blocks reduce the number of steps that are needed for self-assembly of adhesion sites and therefore can make this process less prone to errors, thereby also faster. In comparison to a pool of single-protein building blocks, a pool of combinatorial diversified multi-protein building blocks also implies different regulatory principles for the self-assembly of adhesion sites. Therefore, the findings and conceptual novelty that we present in this work are important and relevant for broad aspects of adhesion sites formation and regulation. We learned from the comment that this aspect should be clarified in the text and accordingly we addressed it in a new paragraph added at the end of the Discussion section in the revised manuscript."

Accordingly, in our measurements the concentrations of the ectopically expressed proteins in the cells (as we can quantify from the FCCS data) were almost all (98%) below 500 nM and the majority of them (84%) were also below 200 nM. Such a range of concentrations is comparable to the range of typical concentrations of endogenous proteins (10-1000 nM; <a href=\"#bib24\">Moran et al., 2010</a>, Cell 141:1262-1262 e1261).

Since each integrin adhesome protein typically has multiple different interactions (Zaidel-Bar, 2007, Nature Cell Biology 9:858-867), many of them mutually exclusive, the total concentration of all endogenous proteins competing on a given A-B interaction can be approximated as the average of typical endogenous concentrations in cells multiplied by the number of the different competing proteins. This total concentration is therefore considerably larger than the concentrations of the ectopically expressed proteins, as we showed that these ectopic expressions are within the typical range of single endogenous proteins. Obviously, not all copies of the competing endogenous proteins will be available for sequestering the ectopically expressed A and B proteins, as they will be also occupied by other interactions. Still, a given increase in the total concentrations of A and B will be distributed over the multiple different competing endogenous proteins. This considerably reduces the sensitivity of the [AB] complex concentration to a given elevation in total A and B concentrations."
