We have solved the crystal structure of paddle chimera, a K<sub>v</sub> channel in complex with charybdotoxin (CTX), a pore-blocking toxin. The toxin binds to the extracellular pore entryway without producing discernable alteration of the selectivity filter structure and is oriented to project its Lys27 into the pore. The most extracellular K<sup>+</sup> binding site (S1) is devoid of K<sup>+</sup> electron-density when wild-type CTX is bound, but K<sup>+</sup> density is present to some extent in a Lys27Met mutant. In crystals with Cs<sup>+</sup> replacing K<sup>+</sup>, S1 electron-density is present even in the presence of Lys27, a finding compatible with the differential effects of Cs<sup>+</sup> vs K<sup>+</sup> on CTX affinity for the channel. Together, these results show that CTX binds to a K<sup>+</sup> channel in a lock and key manner and interacts directly with conducting ions inside the selectivity filter."

We have solved the crystal structure of paddle chimera, a K<sub>v</sub> channel in complex with charybdotoxin (CTX), a pore-blocking toxin. The toxin binds to the extracellular pore entryway without producing discernable alteration of the selectivity filter structure and is oriented to project its Lys27 into the pore. The most extracellular K<sup>+</sup> binding site (S1) is devoid of K<sup>+</sup> electron-density when wild-type CTX is bound, but K<sup>+</sup> density is present to some extent in a Lys27Met mutant. In crystals with Cs<sup>+</sup> replacing K<sup>+</sup>, S1 electron-density is present even in the presence of Lys27, a finding compatible with the differential effects of Cs<sup>+</sup> vs K<sup>+</sup> on CTX affinity for the channel. Together, these results show that CTX binds to a K<sup>+</sup> channel in a lock and key manner and interacts directly with conducting ions inside the selectivity filter."

Banerjee et al. show that the toxin fits into the entrance to the channel like a key into a lock, which means the toxin is preformed to fit the shape of the channel."

When CTX binds to the channel, a lysine residue poised at a critical position on the toxin is so close to the outermost ion-binding site that it prevents potassium ions binding to the site. The structure determined by Banerjee et al. explains many previous findings, including the fact that ions entering the pore from inside the cell can disrupt the binding between the toxin and the ion channel protein. It remains to be seen if the toxins that target the pore of other types of ion channels work in the same way."

These venoms are stored in dedicated glands and are rapidly delivered through specialized apparatus via subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous routes. What is the underlying cause of toxicity of these venoms? The principal toxic components in all of them are peptidic in nature. These venoms usually contain libraries of hundreds of peptide-based toxins that together encompass a high degree of stereochemical diversity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Han et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Liang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Rodriguez de la Vega et al., 2010</a>). Only a small fraction of these molecules, however, have been pharmacologically characterized thus far. The targets of these toxins are typically a variety of ion channels\u2014voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup>(Na<sub>v</sub>), K<sup>+</sup>(K<sub>v</sub>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>(Ca<sub>v</sub>) channels, and cell-surface \u2018receptor\u2019 ion channels, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine (Ach) receptor (<a href=\"#bib5\">Billen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">King et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mouhat et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kasheverov et al., 2009</a>). The remarkable molecular diversity of these toxins is borne out by the fact that multiple different toxins can target different components of the same ion channel/receptor. However, the end result is alteration of the normal physiology of the ion channel/receptor, thereby eliciting the desired reaction of the venom."

These are small peptides, typically ranging from 30 to 40 residues in length, held together by three or four disulfide bonds in a rigid architecture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bontems et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Johnson and Sugg, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fernandez et al., 1994</a>). Pore-blocking toxins have profoundly impacted research in the K<sup>+</sup> channel field primarily in two ways. First, they have enabled purification of specific novel K<sup>+</sup> channels such as the BK channel, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel (<a href=\"#bib17\">Garcia et al., 1997</a>). Second, they provided our first knowledge about channel subunit stoichiometry and the shape of the extracellular K<sup>+</sup> pore entryway at a time when no three-dimensional structure was available for any ion channel (<a href=\"#bib33\">MacKinnon, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gross et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Stampe et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hidalgo and MacKinnon, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Naranjo and Miller, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ranganathan et al., 1996</a>)."

Early experiments with CTX inhibition of the BK channel revealed that CTX binds to the extracellular surface of the channel with a 1:1 channel:toxin stoichiometry, that both the open and closed states of the channel are competent for toxin binding, and that electrostatic interactions play an important role in enhancing the toxin\u2019s affinity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anderson et al., 1988</a>). Furthermore, CTX affinity was found to be voltage dependent, a property later shown to result from the destabilization of the toxin-channel complex by permeant ions entering from the intracellular side (an effect called \u2018trans-enhanced dissociation\u2019; <a href=\"#bib36\">MacKinnon and Miller, 1988</a>). Ions that were unable to traverse the ion conduction pathway did not elicit trans-enhanced dissociation. These observations led to a hypothesis that CTX physically occludes the ion-conduction pathway, and in doing so brings a positive charge on CTX close to a K<sup>+</sup> ion-binding site near the extracellular side (<a href=\"#bib36\">MacKinnon and Miller, 1988</a>). The positive charge was later identified as Lys27, a residue that is conserved in all members of the CTX-like toxin family (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Park and Miller, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Goldstein and Miller, 1993</a>). Studies with other members of the CTX toxin family, most extensively, Agitoxin2 (AgTx2), supported the conclusion that they function in a manner similar to CTX (<a href=\"#bib16\">Garcia et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Krezel et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hidalgo and MacKinnon, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ranganathan et al., 1996</a>). Most notably, conservation of the toxin shape and the functionally important lysine suggested that they all bind with a similar orientation on the K<sup>+</sup> channel and inhibit through a common mechanism, whereby a lysine amino group functions as a K<sup>+</sup> ion mimic to block the pore (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miller, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

We crystallized the complex of paddle chimera with CTX by mixing together separately purified preparations of the channel and the toxin, and setting up cocrystallization trials. The highest resolution data were obtained from the complex of paddle chimera with the selenomethionine derivative of CTX. We used this dataset to solve the structure of the toxin complex of paddle chimera to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution. The architecture of the paddle chimera channel typifies the family of eukaryotic K<sub>v</sub> channels such as Shaker, with four pore domains together forming the ion-conduction pathway through the membrane and four voltage sensor domains surrounding the pore (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Long et al., 2007</a>). The voltage-sensors are linked to the cytoplasmic T1 domains that form a cytosolic tetrameric interface. Each channel-forming \u03b1-subunit is associated with an accessory \u03b2-subunit on the cytoplasmic side. The toxin channel complex shares the same overall architecture, with the fourfold symmetry axis of the channel tetramer coinciding with the fourfold crystallographic symmetry axis. There are two molecules of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-heterodimeric complex in the asymmetric unit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We refer to these as molecule A (top) and molecule B (bottom). Consequently, the symmetry operations generate two distinct tetramers in the lattice. For the toxin-channel complex, an initial omit map without any toxin in the model clearly shows electron density corresponding to the toxin at the pore entryway (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, the electron density for the toxin bound to molecule A, henceforth referred to as toxin A, was clearer and so we used this map for building a model of the toxin-channel complex."

In this case, these orientations are related by the fourfold symmetry axis. Thus, the observed electron density map is a superposition of the electron densities for four such individual orientations of the toxin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Moreover, since in the absence of any external constraints, each orientation is populated with one-fourth occupancy, the electron density for each orientation is inherently weak. Certain secondary structural features in the map were discernible and allowed approximate placement of a CTX molecule, whose structure was determined previously using NMR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B, 4A</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bontems et al., 1991</a>)."

To obtain the additional data, we incorporated electron-dense marker atoms individually, at several sites on the toxin and purified each heavy atom-modified toxin either by peptide synthesis followed by refolding and purification or by overexpression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and following literature procedures (<a href=\"#bib47\">Park et al., 1991</a>). We used three different heavy atom markers\u2014replacement of a disulfide by a diselenide, 4-iodophenylalanine, and selenomethionine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We tested each of these derivatives in a planar bilayer system, and they efficiently blocked the paddle chimera channel (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then crystallized each toxin derivative with paddle chimera and collected single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data at an appropriate wavelength for each derivative. For each derivative, an anomalous difference electron density map showed four heavy-atom peaks, corresponding to the four orientations of the toxin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We collected datasets from crystals with each derivative at a distinct site on the toxin, a total of three datasets (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We next used our highest resolution dataset (of all the different toxin derivative complexes) and roughly placed the toxin in the omit electron density map (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We used this approximate initial placement of the toxin to determine which one of the four symmetry-equivalent peaks in the anomalous difference map (for each marker) corresponded to which orientation of our initial toxin placement. This provided a set of three experimental constraints corresponding to the three individual heavy atom peak positions (for three different markers; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The coordinates of the corresponding three sites from the known NMR structure of the toxin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bontems et al., 1991</a>) were used as three reference constraints. We then used RMSD-based superposition to minimize the sum of distances between the peaks in the map and the predicted positions on the toxin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; final RMSD 1.6 \u00c5). This procedure yielded a constrained placement of the toxin, which was subsequently refined by rigid-body, coordinate-based B-factor refinement in CNS with manual adjustments, where appropriate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

This is consistent with the idea that the toxin fits into the mouth of the channel in a lock and key manner. The oblate-shaped toxin binds asymmetrically to the mouth of the pore domain of the channel such that the wider end is closer to the symmetry axis of the channel than the tapered end (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The helical part of the toxin molecule faces away from the channel and the edge of the toxin formed by the residues 25\u201329 on a \u03b2-strand faces toward the channel. The inherent architecture of this class of toxins is such that the three disulfide bonds that hold the folded toxin together are the main buried components in the structure and most of the side chains are displayed on the surface of the toxin. These side chains are in a position to engage into a number of different kinds of interactions with the channel molecule (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7A,B</a>). Closer to the fourfold symmetry axis of the channel, the aromatic ring of Tyr36 is positioned to pack simultaneously against Asp375 and Val377 of one subunit and Met29 is able to pack against Asp375 of an adjacent subunit (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Closer to the periphery, the side chain of Arg25 is within close proximity of Gln353, and the peptide backbone near Thr8-Thr9 is held against Gln353 of another subunit (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). There are also residues that should be involved in long-range electrostatic interactions, that is, Arg25 is within 5.5 \u00c5 of Asp359. The guanidium headgroup of Arg25 could also, in principle, engage in electrostatic interactions with an ordered lipid that is present in the structure. Although the density of the lipid headgroup is not clear in this case, it is likely that the headgroup will be placed close enough for the Arg25 to make electrostatic contact with it. Arg34 is another residue that approaches the channel closely enough to make electrostatic interactions, that is, with the carbonyl oxygen of Asp375. Arg34 is also within H-bonding distance of Gln353 and within long-range electrostatic contact of Asp375. Asn30 is another residue that appears to approach close to Asp375 to enable a weak H-bonding interaction."

In the structure of the paddle chimera, as well as other high-resolution K<sup>+</sup> channel structures, the selectivity filter contains four distinct ion-binding sites or positions, S1 through S4, S1 being the most extracellular (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhou et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Long et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nishida et al., 2007</a>). From analyses of high-resolution diffraction data on KcsA, the prototypical K<sup>+</sup> channel pore, it was inferred that during conduction, these ion-binding sites are occupied alternately in what are referred to as 1,3 and 2,4 configurations (<a href=\"#bib40\">Morais-Cabral et al., 2001</a>). In accordance, the occupancy of each site was experimentally determined to be roughly 0.5 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zhou and MacKinnon, 2003</a>). In the toxin-channel complex, only sites S2 through S4 have discernible electron density (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The top ion-binding site appears empty. It is important to note here that this observation holds strictly true for both channel molecules in the asymmetric unit. We have several datasets for all the different derivative toxin complexes, and this observation holds true for all of them as well, in both channel molecules A and B, in the asymmetric unit."

The toxin binds at the mouth of the pore positioned in such a manner to project the side chain of Lys27 straight into the pore, allowing the amino group to approach the top of site S1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, Lys27 is within the range to make hydrogen-bonding interactions with all four carbonyl oxygen atoms that would otherwise constitute the top-half layer of coordinating ligands for a K<sup>+</sup> at site S1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhou et al., 2001</a>). We suspect therefore two reasons why K<sup>+</sup> is disfavored at site S1. First, there is electrostatic repulsion from the closely placed positively charged amino group, and second, carbonyl oxygen atoms that would otherwise constitute half of the coordination are not fully available for coordination with a K<sup>+</sup> at site S1. The structure thus offers a simple rationale for the altered distribution of ions in the selectivity filter of the toxin-bound channel."

To further correlate the ion distribution in the crystal with trans-enhanced dissociation in electrophysiology experiments, we crystallized the channel with a mutant toxin, Lys27Met. Miller and coworkers had shown that Lys27 mutants reduce toxin affinity and abolish trans-enhanced dissociation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Park and Miller, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein et al., 1994</a>). Lys27Met CTX indeed inhibits the paddle chimera channel with reduced affinity (\u223c630 nM) but still forms a complex at the high concentrations of channel (\u223c20 \u03bcM) and toxin (60\u201380 \u03bcM) present in crystallization trials (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). Electron density is present at S1 in an ion omit map, compatible with the presence of an ion, although the density at S1 is weaker relative to the ion densities at S2\u2013S4, as if the occupancy at S1 is reduced (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Thus, it appears that the ability of toxin to interact with ions in the pore (and thus alter the ion distribution) is directly connected to the ability of ions from the intracellular solution to destabilize toxin on the extracellular side through interaction with Lys27. A simple mechanistic explanation could be that K<sup>+</sup> and toxin\u2014via Lys27\u2014compete for stabilizing interactions at S1 in the selectivity filter."

A CTX complex with the paddle chimera channel in the presence of Cs<sup>+</sup> shows that toxin is bound but that Cs<sup>+</sup> adopts its expected distribution (i.e., similar to its distribution in KcsA in the absence of toxin) with an ion at S1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). It is difficult to tell where in the electron density map the amino group of Lys27 resides, but it is clear that Cs<sup>+</sup> competes effectively for site S1, despite the presence of CTX.

Many of the original studies on pore-blocking toxins for K<sup>+</sup> channels were carried out with eukaryotic voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels, such as Shaker and K<sub>v</sub>1.3, closely related in sequence to the mutant version of the eukaryotic K<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel that we employed in our structural studies (<a href=\"#bib37\">MacKinnon and Miller, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">MacKinnon, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Goldstein and Miller, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Stampe et al., 1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gross et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aiyar et al., 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hidalgo and MacKinnon, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gross and MacKinnon, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Naini and Miller, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Naranjo and Miller, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ranganathan et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">MacKinnon et al., 1998</a>). Our first major finding is that we do not see discernible changes in the structure of the channel between the toxin-bound and the toxin-free paddle chimera structures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,F</a>). This, we note, is in contrast to the solid-state NMR \u2018structure\u2019 of a KcsA mutant with kaliotoxin, where such rearrangements in the channel were proposed (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lange et al., 2006</a>). In this NMR study, chemical shift changes induced by toxin were interpreted as resulting from dihedral angle changes (i.e., structural); however, such chemical shift changes could have other origins (i.e., electrostatic). Moreover, no channel-toxin distance restraints were included in the determination of this solid-state NMR \u2018structure\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lange et al., 2006</a>). In the crystal structure presented here, the good precomplex complementarity between the shape of the channel entryway and the shape of the toxin (i.e., the absence of channel structural change upon toxin binding) suggests a possible explanation for two prominent features of pore-blocking toxins. First, toxins can bind with relatively high affinity to their target channels because binding free energy is not \u2018spent\u2019 bringing about a protein conformational change. And second, single mutations in the \u2018toxin receptor\u2019 region of the channel can drastically alter the affinity for the channel by disrupting the good fit (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Garcia et al., 1997</a>)."

In hindsight, this static toxin receptor on K<sub>v</sub> channels lends credence to the idea that was originally proposed for using the pore-blocking toxins as \u2018molecular slide calipers\u2019 for gauging, at the resolution of mutagenesis, the shape of the protein surface on the extracellular part of the pore domain (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Stampe et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hidalgo and MacKinnon, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ranganathan et al., 1996</a>). A large body of data has emerged from these studies on mutagenesis-based electrophysiological measurements of toxin-channel interactions in the K<sub>v</sub> channel family, mainly using the toxin-channel pairs Shaker\u2013CTX, Shaker\u2013AgTx2, and to a lesser extent, K<sub>v</sub>1.3\u2013CTX (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stocker and Miller, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hidalgo and MacKinnon, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aiyar et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Naini and Miller, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Naranjo and Miller, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ranganathan et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rauer et al., 2000</a>). We have mapped these data onto our structure. Among these measurements, the data obtained with mutant cycle analyses are more reliable in gauging residue proximities on either side of the toxin-channel interface. The mapping has been done in the following manner: for the channel, we have used a sequence alignment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) to match the corresponding residue in Shaker or K<sub>v</sub>1.3 onto paddle chimera. Data from the studies using CTX are shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> and those using AgTx2 in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>. For AgTx2, we used the known structure of AgTx2 and the guidelines in <a href=\"#bib29\">Krezel et al. (1995)</a> to superimpose AgTx2 onto CTX in the structure of the paddle chimera\u2013CTX complex. A few data points were derived from lysine scanning, which alters the length of the wild-type residue appreciably. For the lysine mutations, for the sake of representation, the corresponding residue in paddle chimera was mutated in silico (in Coot) to lysine, and the rotamer of lysine with the least distance between the corresponding toxin residue was chosen. Our structure is overall in excellent agreement with not only the CTX data but also with the AgTx2 data."

From analyzing mutants of AgTx2 and Shaker, MacKinnon and Ranganathan derived a coupling energy of &gt;3 kT for the Gly10Val(AgTx2)\u2013Phe425Gly(Shaker) pair and \u223c1.5 kT for the Gly10Val(AgTx2)\u2013Thr449Cys(Shaker) pair (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ranganathan et al., 1996</a>). Phe425 and Thr449 in Shaker map onto Gln353 and Val377 in paddle chimera (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). An inspection of the structure reveals clearly that Gly10 is close to Gln353 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>), which is consistent with the high coupling energy. Intriguingly, Val377 is not within the first layer of surrounding residues contacted by Gly10. However, Val377 is within close proximity to Gln353 such that a mutation of Gly10 to valine would incur a clash of Gln353 with Val377 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). It is worthwhile noting that pairwise mutant cycle analysis per se does not distinguish between direct interactions and such interactions mediated by a third residue. However, the relative magnitude of the coupling energies, in hindsight, is consistent with such a mode of interaction."

Since mutation of Tyr to Phe incurs only a loss of the hydroxyl group, one likely interpretation of this would have been that Lys27 contacts the hydroxyl group of Tyr445. Intriguingly, Lys27 only contacts the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr445, a point farthest from the hydroxyl group (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). However, since this is a tightly packed part of the protein structure with the hydroxyl group being a part of an interaction network, mutation of the hydroxyl is felt at the backbone carbonyl by the toxin. MacKinnon and Ranganathan also found that the interaction between these two residues is dependent on the K<sup>+</sup> concentration.

In studies with the BK channel, <a href=\"#bib37\">MacKinnon and Miller (1988)</a> first observed that permeant ions coming through the channel from the intracellular side enhance the dissociation of a toxin bound to its receptor on the extracellular side. This trans-enhanced dissociation effect of permeant ions on CTX block of K<sup>+</sup> channels was subsequently confirmed for Shaker as well (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goldstein and Miller, 1993</a>). In order to explain this phenomenon, MacKinnon and Miller put forward the hypothesis that the toxin binds at a site close to the ion permeation pathway and places a positive charge close to one of the ion-binding sites in the channel. Additionally, it was also observed that this voltage-dependent and permeant ion\u2013dependent block was nearly completely abolished when Lys27 was mutated to a neutral Asn or Gln residue (<a href=\"#bib48\">Park and Miller, 1992</a>). Mutation of no other residue on the toxin had the same effect. This implied that the electrostatic interaction between the K<sup>+</sup> in the ion-binding site and the toxin was wholly mediated by this single Lys residue, and the structure of the toxin-paddle chimera complex shows exactly why that is so. In the structure of the WT CTX-K<sup>+</sup> complex, the top ion-binding site S1 has no density corresponding to K<sup>+</sup> ions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and the positively charged amino group is positioned to form contacts with S1 instead (i.e., making hydrogen-bonding interactions with the carbonyl oxygen atoms comprising the top layer of coordinating ligands at S1; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). From the structure, it is clear that only the side chain of Lys27 approaches close enough to the S1 site to exert such an effect (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is worth noting here that the long linear alkyl chain and the tetrahedral disposition of hydrogens around the terminal nitrogen of Lysine make it uniquely and chemically suited for making maximal contacts with the top layer of coordinating carbonyl oxygen atoms at S1. Because this region is buried within the protein, this is likely to be a highly stabilizing interaction. Even a conservative mutation of Lys27 to Arginine causes \u223c1000-fold destabilization of the toxin-channel complex in Shaker (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein et al., 1994</a>)."

It is interesting to note, in light of the present structure, the basic mechanistic principles underlying the mode of action of these toxins. In a strikingly simple but effective strategy, the toxins target a functional aspect common to all the K<sup>+</sup> channels\u2014ion conduction. At the structural level, this is executed by presenting the amino group of Lys27, a highly conserved residue (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), to the top ion-binding site in the selectivity filter. This acts as a tethered surrogate cation and effectively plugs the ion-conduction pathway. How is this surrogate cation brought to this site in the first place? The structures of these miniproteins are held together by rigid disulfide bonds, that are highly conserved in this and other families of small peptide-based toxins. This provides a relatively rigid scaffold. Through evolutionary sampling of intervening less-conserved residues, individual toxins have gained the ability to engage in specific interactions by long-range electrostatic interactions and a few subtype-specific close contacts, thereby ensuring efficient channel block. This is a remarkable example of combinatorial diversity in nature with the constraints of a rigid scaffold and a conserved mechanism to target one of the most important classes of sensory molecules in biology. Scorpion toxins have evolved to fit like a lock and key into the pore entryway of potassium channels, and disrupt ion conduction through presentation of a lysine amino group that competes with potassium in the selectivity filter."

The coupling cycles used on the CEM synthesizer all through the synthesis were milder than standard synthesizer cycles. Following a published protocol (<a href=\"#bib60\">Walewska et al., 2009</a>), the peptide was cleaved from the resin using reagent K and DTNP, followed by thiolation in presence of DTT. The crude peptide was purified using reverse-phase HPLC with a Vydac C-18 reverse phase preparative column (Vydac 218TP1022) using a linear gradient of 14% solvent B to 40% solvent B over a 60-min period (solvent A\u20140.1% TFA in H<sub>2</sub>O; solvent B\u20140.1% TFA in 90% MeCN/H<sub>2</sub>O). It was subjected to cyclization as described above for the 4-iodophenylalanine mutant, and the cyclized product was again purified by reverse-phase HPLC with a Vydac C-18 reverse-phase preparative column (Vydac 218TP1022) using a linear gradient of 14% solvent B to 40% solvent B over a 60-min period (solvent A\u20140.1% TFA in H<sub>2</sub>O; solvent B\u20140.1% TFA in 90% MeCN/H<sub>2</sub>O). The product was further characterized by analytical reverse-phase HPLC using C18 reverse-phase analytical column (Vydac 218TP5415) and ESI-MS.

However, the observed electron density map is a superposition of the electron densities for four individual orientations in which the toxin can bind to the tetrameric channel. Moreover, each orientation is only fractionally occupied, thus making the electron density for each orientation inherently weak. Certain secondary structural features in the map were discernible (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and allowed approximate placement of a CTX molecule using the available NMR structure of CTX (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bontems et al., 1991</a>). However, it was obvious from the outset that this initial model would require additional data to achieve a reasonable level of accuracy. We used anomalous electron density maps from three different heavy atom derivatives of CTX to obtain further constraints that helped us in improving our initial placement of the toxin (see section \u201cBuilding a model for the toxin\u201d in main text for details). This improved placement was used as a starting point for crystallographic refinement, which was subsequently refined by rigid-body, coordinate-based B-factor refinement in CNS with manual adjustments, where appropriate. During refinement, the interactions between symmetry-related toxin molecules were prevented by using \u2018igroup\u2019 statements in CNS refinement scripts."

The crystallographic symmetry operation thus creates two independent tetrameric channels, each containing four \u03b1-monomers and four \u03b2-monomers. The model for the toxin was built for the toxin bound to channel A since the electron density for this toxin was much better defined. The asymmetric unit contained one orientation of the toxin modeled at 0.25 occupancy. Consequently, the fourfold symmetry operation generated the other three possible orientations for the toxin molecule to bind to the channel. The independence of molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit and anomalous electron density from the selenomethionine derivative of CTX provided additional validation for our model of the toxin (see section \u201cBuilding a model for the toxin\u201d in main text for details).

And now there is a structure, which dramatically confirms most of the former indirect conclusions, and provides deeper and more elaborate interpretations to them."

In order to determine the structure, the authors had to overcome a formidable challenge that arises due to the mismatch between the four-fold symmetry in the channel and the lack of symmetry in the toxin. They did this by incorporating three different heavy atom probes in the toxin, and measuring X-ray anomalous diffraction for crystals with each derivative. In this way, they were able to place the toxin at the mouth of the pore with a reasonable degree of confidence. The structure has been determined at 2.5 \u00c5 resolution, which leads to further confidence in the interpretations presented here."

Thus, even though most of what is described here is consistent with what was inferred previously, the availability of this new structure provides a reliable framework for the design of new experiments and the interpretation of new ones. Furthermore, NMR data (cited in the paper) had been used previously to infer that the channel undergoes conformational changes upon toxin binding. The crystal structure presented here demonstrates that it does not, and shows that the binding is well described by a classic \u201clock and key\u201d interaction. This clears up a possible source of confusion and adds to the significance of this paper."

The paper simply shows some chemical shift changes in both the toxin and channel upon binding, which very possibly do not have their origin in structural changes. Thus, we have removed the reference to Lange et al. from the last paragraph of the Discussion (and kept the references to Takeuchi et al. and Yu et al., which refer to NMR models based on distance restraints). Regarding the conformational changes proposed in the Kaliotoxin NMR \u201cstructure\u201d (Lange et al.) we have added the following to the Discussion:"
