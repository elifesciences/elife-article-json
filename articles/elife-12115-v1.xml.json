Domestic pigeons have striking variation in foot feathering within a single species, providing a tractable model to investigate the molecular basis of skin appendage differences. We found that feathered feet in pigeons result from a partial transformation from hindlimb to forelimb identity mediated by <i>cis</i>-regulatory changes in the genes encoding the hindlimb-specific transcription factor Pitx1 and forelimb-specific transcription factor Tbx5. We also found that ectopic expression of <i>Tbx5</i> is associated with foot feathers in chickens, suggesting similar molecular pathways underlie phenotypic convergence between these two species. These results show how changes in expression of regional patterning genes can generate localized changes in organ fate and morphology, and provide viable molecular mechanisms for diversity in hindlimb scale and feather distribution."

Domestic pigeons have striking variation in foot feathering within a single species, providing a tractable model to investigate the molecular basis of skin appendage differences. We found that feathered feet in pigeons result from a partial transformation from hindlimb to forelimb identity mediated by <i>cis</i>-regulatory changes in the genes encoding the hindlimb-specific transcription factor Pitx1 and forelimb-specific transcription factor Tbx5. We also found that ectopic expression of <i>Tbx5</i> is associated with foot feathers in chickens, suggesting similar molecular pathways underlie phenotypic convergence between these two species. These results show how changes in expression of regional patterning genes can generate localized changes in organ fate and morphology, and provide viable molecular mechanisms for diversity in hindlimb scale and feather distribution."

They also surveyed the entire DNA sequences of many additional pigeon breeds with and without feathered feet. This combined approach showed that two regions of the pigeon genome have a profound effect on the number and size of feathers on the feet of domestic pigeons. These regions contain genes that are known to play key roles in controlling the growth of a limb and whether it develops into a leg or a wing. In developing pigeon embryos, Domyan et al. found that a gene called <i>Pitx1,</i> which is typically considered a hindlimb gene, is expressed at lower levels in the developing legs of breeds with feathered feet than in a breed with scaled feet. The experiments also showed that <i>Tbx5</i>, a gene that is expressed in the forelimbs of many animals, is expressed abnormally in the embryonic hindlimbs of breeds of pigeon and chicken with feathery feet."

Most birds possess scales on the foot (tarsometatarsus and toes) and feathers elsewhere. Exceptions to this pattern can provide insights into the evolutionary and developmental basis of skin appendage diversity. Some raptors and boreal birds evolved foot feathers instead of scales ('ptilopody'; <a href=\"#bib14\">Danforth, 1919</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lucas and Stettenheim, 1972</a>), but the lack of appendage variation <i>within</i> these species precludes their use as genetic models. Likewise, paravians (birds and their close non-avian theropod dinosaur relatives) and other dinosaurs evolved diverse feather coverings on their legs and feet that sometimes resemble flight-like feathers (<a href=\"#bib77\">Xu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Turner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Foth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Godefroit et al., 2014</a>), but the absence of living specimens preclude mechanistic molecular studies."

Most breeds have feet covered by scaled epidermis (wild-type), but scales are replaced by small feathers in <i>grouse (gr</i>) mutants, and by larger feather 'muffs' in birds that also carry mutant alleles at the <i>Slipper (Sl</i>) locus (<a href=\"#bib19\">Doncaster, 1912</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wexelsen, 1934</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hollander, 1937</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Levi, 1986</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In muffed breeds, scutellate scales are generally absent or poorly developed on the feathered epidermis covering the tarsometatarsus and toes, and feathers are surrounded by soft integument. The molecular identities of both <i>gr</i> and <i>Sl</i> are unknown, and additional loci probably control quantitative variation in the muff phenotype. Because both scale-footed and feather-footed pigeon breeds belong to the same species, we can use traditional genetic crosses and whole-genome resequencing to map the genes that control this striking variation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Shapiro et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Domyan et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, we can study diversity of the magnitude usually observed <i>among</i> different species without the roadblock of hybrid incompatibility that often eliminates the possibility of genetic mapping studies."

F<sub>1</sub> hybrids displayed intermediate foot feathering, demonstrating a semi-dominant inheritance pattern. Scaled, muffed, and intermediate phenotypes were recovered in the F<sub>2</sub> population, confirming that a small number of major-effect loci contribute to this trait. Among F<sub>2</sub> offspring, digit 3 bore the largest and greatest number of feathers (digit 1, 7.04 \u00b1 5.08 feathers; digit 2, 7.64 \u00b1 7.54; digit 3, 15.46 \u00b1 10.43; digit 4, 6.13 \u00b1 5.70). Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with 130 F<sub>2</sub> offspring genotyped at 3803 polymorphic markers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Broman et al., 2003</a>), we identified two linkage groups (LG11 and LG20) that had significant effects on three different aspects of foot feathering (log<sub>10</sub> odds ratio (LOD) &gt; 4.6; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

LG20 had the largest effect on toe feather length (LOD = 20.9, PVE = 52.2%), and a smaller effect on toe feather number (LOD = 5.36, PVE = 16.5%). When toe feather number was analyzed for each digit individually, the same two QTL were identified and had the most pronounced effects on digits 3 and 4 (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

These regions were especially intriguing because these two genes encode key transcriptional regulators of forelimb (<i>Tbx5)</i> and hindlimb (<i>Pitx1</i>) identity and development (<a href=\"#bib47\">Logan et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Logan and Tabin, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rodriguez-Esteban et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Szeto et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Takeuchi et al., 1999</a>). For example, misexpression of <i>Pitx1</i> in the embryonic chick forelimb blocks feather development (<a href=\"#bib48\">Logan and Tabin, 1999</a>), while misexpression of <i>Tbx5</i> in the early hindlimb field of embryonic chickens is sufficient to induce a partial wing-like transformation, including feather formation on the feet (<a href=\"#bib69\">Takeuchi et al., 1999</a>). In mouse, <i>Pitx1</i> (but not <i>Tbx5)</i> plays a role in determining limb-type identity (<a href=\"#bib68\">Szeto et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Minguillon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">DeLaurier et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that the roles of <i>Tbx5</i> in limb outgrowth and identity have diversified during amniote evolution (<a href=\"#bib38\">Horton et al., 2008</a>)."

In contrast, and despite quantitative expression differences among breeds, <i>Pitx1</i> had a qualitatively similar expression domain in embryos of scale-footed and feather-footed breeds at this stage (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, consistent with the critical role of mesoderm in determining ectodermal fate (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hughes et al., 2011</a>), regionalized ectopic expression of <i>Tbx5</i> is correlated with enhanced local transformation of epidermal appendages."

To test this prediction, we generated F<sub>1</sub> hybrid pigeon embryos by crossing an Old Dutch Capuchine (scale-footed) to a fairy swallow (muffed), and measured parent-of-origin allele expression in the hybrid embryonic hindlimb at HH25 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Domyan et al., 2014</a>). Consistent with expression differences we observed <i>among</i> breeds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), expression of the feathered-foot allele of <i>Pitx1</i> was approximately 20% lower than the scaled-foot allele (expression of feathered-foot relative to scaled-foot allele: 0.807 \u00b1 0.039, p=0.003, n = 6 embryos), and expression of the feathered-foot allele of <i>Tbx5</i> was nearly 1600% higher than the scaled-foot allele (relative expression of feathered-foot allele: 15.75 \u00b1 4.69, p=0.002, n = 7 embryos) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). In contrast, expression levels of feathered-foot and scaled-foot alleles of <i>Tbx3</i> were indistinguishable (relative expression of feathered-foot allele: 0.99 \u00b1 0.05, p=0.68, n = 7 embryos) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Strikingly, two regions of significantly different enrichment in racing homer hindlimbs relative to forelimbs were within the 44-kb genomic region that is deleted in the Indian fantail, and one of these regions (log10 likelihood ratio = 4.93) is adjacent to the hs1473 limb enhancer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The overlapping patterns of enrichment in Indian fantail hindlimbs and wild-type forelimbs suggest that ectopic hindlimb expression of <i>Tbx5</i> could be due to de-repression of forelimb-specific enhancers.

We found consistent soft-tissue patterning defects in both feather-footed pigeon breeds: the fibularis longus (FL) tendon inserts on the dorsal rather than ventral surface of the proximal tarsometatarsus, the flexor perforans et perforatus (FPP3) muscle adopts a longitudinal rather than pennate fiber orientation, and a slip of the FPP3 fuses with the FL tendon (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These changes are aberrations of normal patterning, although they are not necessarily clear transformations to a more forelimb-like configuration. We also found that the fibula, which is normally splint-like and shorter than the tibia in pigeons, was enlarged (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>) and two phalanges of digit 4 were fused in feather-footed breeds (not shown). These are not necessarily limb-type transformations, either. However, experimental ectopic expression of <i>Tbx5</i> in the hindlimbs of chick embryos produces an enlargement of the fibula reminiscent of extreme pigeon phenotypes, and <a href=\"#bib69\">Takeuchi et al., 1999</a> compared this morphology to a forelimb-like condition (the fibula \u201cmakes a joint at its distal end like a normal ulna [the corresponding postaxial zeugopod bone of the forelimb],\u201d p. 810). Notably, all of the modified structures of ptilopodous pigeons develop in the posterior (lateral in the adult) and dorsal hindlimb, which are the primary sites of ectopic <i>Tbx5</i> expression.

This apparent conflict could be because the causative gene in silkies is not actually <i>Pitx1</i> but rather a gene closely linked to it, or because <i>Pitx1</i> expression differences are more pronounced and consistent at developmental stages that we did not assay. Furthermore, different populations of breeds such as silkies appear to have different constellations of ptilopody loci and alleles, and it is possible that we used strains that do not have <i>Pitx1</i> mutations (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wexelsen, 1934</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Somes, 1992</a>).

These alterations do not represent a complete transformation of limb type, as the hindlimbs of feather-footed pigeons are still readily recognizable as legs. This suggests that limb-type identity is not a simple binary choice between two global fates. For example, feather-footed pigeons have a radical transformation of the distal hindlimb dermis, yet changes to other hindlimb mesoderm derivatives (muscle, skeleton) are subtler and largely restricted to lateral structures in the adult. Therefore, we propose that different aspects of fore- and hindlimb morphology could have different dosage- and/or stage-dependent requirements for exposure to identity cues. Our ongoing analyses of musculoskeletal phenotypes in our F<sub>2</sub> cross, which includes individuals with different combinations of feathered-foot alleles of <i>Pitx1</i> and <i>Tbx5</i>, will allow us to understand the separate and epistatic effects of these loci on musculoskeletal anatomy. We note that, although genetic manipulations indicate that <i>Tbx5</i> does not specify forelimb identity in mice, the divergence time between mammals and birds is deep (&gt;300 million years) and subtly different roles for this transcription factor in limb outgrowth and identity might have evolved in these lineages (<a href=\"#bib51\">Minguillon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Horton et al., 2008</a>)."

Similarly, we observed increased foot feathering in pigeons with just one derived allele of <i>Pitx1</i> or <i>Tbx5</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Ancient pigeon breeders could have rapidly selected for ptilopodous pigeon lines starting with birds that were heterozygous for mutations at either locus, and later generated the extreme muffed phenotype by hybridization.

Our findings suggest the mechanistic basis for the development of feathered feet in two distantly related domestic bird species is due to a partial transformation of limb identity, through <i>cis-</i>acting regulatory mutations in limb-type specific transcription factors. Most modern wild birds have a scaled metatarsus and toes, although some species (e.g., ptarmigan, snowy owl, and golden eagle) have extensive foot feathering. However, recent paleontological evidence suggests that feathers \u2013 not scales \u2013 might be the ancestral hindlimb skin appendages in birds and some of their close non-avian dinosaur relatives (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the epidermis of feather-footed modern birds might actually represent a reversion to the ancestral avialan skin condition. In some cases, the large, asymmetric-vaned, pennaceous metatarsal feathers of basal birds and their non-avian dinosaur relatives are so extensive that their hindlimbs have been interpreted as 'hind wings',\u00a0although they clearly retain hindlimb skeletal identity (<a href=\"#bib80\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, these long foot feathers are directed laterally from the foot, and they display vane width asymmetries reminiscent of flight feathers; we find a similar morphology in muffed pigeons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Perhaps not coincidentally, <a href=\"#bib15\">Darwin, 1868</a> noted of the muffed English trumpeter pigeon, \u201cTheir feet are so heavily feathered, that they almost appear like little wings\u201d (p. 155)."

Thus, major determinants of dramatic phenotypic variation can be mechanistically simple and therefore potentially evolve rapidly. In pigeons, these mechanisms can generate wing-like feathers on a hindlimb that is not used for powered flight or gliding. This, in turn, suggests that wing-like foot and leg feathers in other species, such as non-avian dinosaurs, might result from developmental constraints on the morphology of large limb feathers, rather than from functional adaptations for flight (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gould and Lewontin, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Foth et al., 2014</a>)."

Also, not too much can/should be read into the expression domain of Pitx1 shown for two breeds of pigeon.

In regard to the fibula differences, it would certainly appear to be longer in the muffed pigeon but it remains a fibula in position and morphology. To suggest it is like an ulna is a misrepresentation. It looks nothing like an ulna in shape or articulation.

The current interpretations of the results, without reference to the prior work in other systems, could further muddy an already messy literature on the roles of genes in determining the differences between fore limbs and hind limbs. It is therefore essential to clearly understand the functional significance of the QTL and expression analyses they have carried out.

There are of course feathers in many other regions of the bird where Tbx5 is not expressed also. Chicken breeds also show variation in feathering in the hindlimb-cochin and silkie chicken are analyzed to some extent. In silkie and some other chicken breeds (silky-feather) the basis of the mutation is known and/or causes other defects such as ploydactyly in Silkies.

First, classical genetic studies implicate major effects of the grouse and slipper loci, the molecular identities of which were previously unknown. Second, our QTL mapping study implicated just two loci of major effect on the phenotype. Importantly, our F2 intercross led to the recombining of muffed and scaled genomes, thereby minimizing the effects of the parental genetic backgrounds on phenotypic variation in the F2 offspring. If other loci had significant effects on the phenotype, we would have observed additional significant QTL. As the size of our F2 population increases, we might have enough power to map additional loci that make small contributions to the phenotype. Some of these loci might converge directly on the Tbx5 and Pitx1 pathways, but we see no reason to assume that they will. However, this does not diminish the result that the two QTL we mapped in this study do indeed control a large proportion of phenotypic variance in the cross. Third, our genome scans comparing scale-footed and feather-footed breeds independently detected the same two chromosome regions as our QTL mapping study. If other loci exerted major effects on the phenotype or were selected repeatedly across breeds, we would have detected them in our selection scans. It remains possible that other loci have minor effects on the phenotype, and we might not have the power to detect them in our whole-genome scans of scale-footed and feather-footed breeds. Our results also do not exclude the possibility of allelic heterogeneity at modifier loci, which would make them harder to detect. However, these possibilities do not diminish the two highly significant associations we detected with our current data set.

It is indeed possible that expression of Tbx5 is altered in other regions of the embryo; however, the embryonic wing is not one of these regions, as demonstrated by the expression assays reported in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (Tbx5 forelimb expression among breeds is statistically indistinguishable). Moreover, whole-mount in situ hybridization of Tbx5 only revealed major Tbx5 expression pattern changes in the hind limbs of muffed embryos. Crucially, the two significant QTL and genomic regions were identified specifically and exclusively based on hind limb feathering phenotypes. These genomic regions might have an effect on development and feathering of other structures, but this issue was not addressed in, and is largely irrelevant to, our study. Two separate methodologies \u2013 QTL mapping and whole-genome scans \u2013 converged on the same two loci, and only these two loci, that exert quantitative (QTL mapping) and qualitative (genome scans) effects on foot feathering. After identifying these two loci based specifically on hind limb phenotypes, we expected to see coding changes \u2013 we did not find any fixed differences \u2013 or limb bud expression differences among breeds with different hind limb phenotypes. Therefore, we assayed limb bud expression among breeds to check the viability of strong candidate genes in these regions, and then showed definitively that Pitx1 and Tbx5 have cis-regulatory changes in a hybrid background. The hybrid background is important because alleles inherited from each parent are responding to the same trans-acting factors in a common cellular environment; thus, any differences in expression are attributable to cis-regulatory differences between parental alleles. This allele-specific expression experiment is crucial because it shows that expression differences in Pitx1 and Tbx5 are not just different among phenotypes, but they are also heritable: the feathered-foot allele of Tbx5 is expressed at a higher level in the hybrid hind limb bud, and the feathered-foot allele of Pitx1 is expressed at a lower level. In contrast, similar expression levels of different alleles in the hybrid background would confirm that differences among phenotypes are solely attributable to trans-acting regulatory changes (e.g., differential expression of an upstream transcription factor); however, we did not observe this outcome for either Pitx1 or Tbx5. To emphasize the importance of this experiment, we have moved the explanation of this experiment and its results into a new figure in the main text (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, formerly part of <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Further supporting our interpretation, the genome-wide H3K27ac ChIP-seq enrichment differences in limb buds from breeds with different limb phenotypes were significant in regions near Pitx1 and Tbx5. All of these analyses were specific to the embryonic (gene expression) or adult (phenotypes) hind limbs. Future experiments could indeed explore the role of Tbx5 in generating variation in feathering or other traits elsewhere in the embryo and adult; however, we intentionally drew genomic data from a wide variety of feather-footed breeds that do not share other obvious traits in common. Therefore, we would not expect to obtain similar results for other traits with our current data set."

A previous genetic mapping study implicated a chromosomal region around Pitx1 in ptilopody in silkies, but specific genes and mutations were not identified. In fact, the Pitx1 gene was not even mentioned as a candidate gene in that study (Dorshorst et al., 2010, J Hered). Polydactyly in silkies is a different genetic issue than ptilopody (these two loci are unlinked), and we do not address this issue in the manuscript. Ptilopodous silkies can be polydactyl, but not all are. Silky feathering throughout the body is also unlinked to ptilopody.
