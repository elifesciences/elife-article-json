We present an analytical toolbox, based on quantitative single-cell imaging data, to interrogate this heterogeneity. Integrating supervised behavioral classification with multivariate analyses of cell motion, membrane dynamics, cell-matrix adhesion status and F-actin organization, this toolbox here enables the detection and characterization of two quantitatively distinct mesenchymal migration modes, termed 'Continuous' and 'Discontinuous'. Quantitative mode comparisons reveal differences in cell motion, spatiotemporal coordination of membrane protrusion/retraction, and how cells within each mode reorganize with changed cell speed. These modes thus represent distinctive migratory strategies. Additional analyses illuminate the macromolecular- and cellular-scale effects of molecular targeting (fibronectin, talin, ROCK), including 'adaptive switching' between Continuous (favored at high adhesion/full contraction) and Discontinuous (low adhesion/inhibited contraction) modes. Overall, this analytical toolbox now facilitates the exploration of both spontaneous and adaptive heterogeneity in mesenchymal migration."

We present an analytical toolbox, based on quantitative single-cell imaging data, to interrogate this heterogeneity. Integrating supervised behavioral classification with multivariate analyses of cell motion, membrane dynamics, cell-matrix adhesion status and F-actin organization, this toolbox here enables the detection and characterization of two quantitatively distinct mesenchymal migration modes, termed 'Continuous' and 'Discontinuous'. Quantitative mode comparisons reveal differences in cell motion, spatiotemporal coordination of membrane protrusion/retraction, and how cells within each mode reorganize with changed cell speed. These modes thus represent distinctive migratory strategies. Additional analyses illuminate the macromolecular- and cellular-scale effects of molecular targeting (fibronectin, talin, ROCK), including 'adaptive switching' between Continuous (favored at high adhesion/full contraction) and Discontinuous (low adhesion/inhibited contraction) modes. Overall, this analytical toolbox now facilitates the exploration of both spontaneous and adaptive heterogeneity in mesenchymal migration."

Prior to migration, cells are usually attached to a scaffold called the extracellular-matrix, which helps to hold them in a particular location within a tissue. Individual cells can move in different ways. During a type of movement called mesenchymal migration, the front end of a cell grows outwards and attaches to a different section of the matrix. The rear of the cell is pulled forward and it detaches from the matrix and retracts, which allows the entire cell to move forward. In contrast, during amoeboid migration, the moving cells are only loosely attached to the matrix and move by gliding."

In contrast, in the cells that migrated using the Continuous mode, an outgrowth consistently led to a retraction, which enabled cells to move in one direction."

                        "text": "Cell migration is a profoundly heterogeneous phenomenon. Indeed, cells can adopt several substantially different migration modalities, including multicellular, amoeboid, and mesenchymal (also termed lamellipodial or lamellipodial-driven) migration, which can all be utilized by a broad range of cell types, as well as lobopodial migration, which has been observed specifically in fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib8\">Friedl and Wolf, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sahai, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Petrie and Yamada, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Petrie et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Welch, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Friedl and Alexander, 2011</a>). These migration modes represent 'prespecified' cellular configurations (i.e. cell states) that are favored under particular conditions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Friedl, 2004</a>). Switch-like conversion between these distinct modes is therefore part of the plastic, adaptive/compensatory response of cells to either environmental modulation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Starke et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ruprecht et al., 2015</a>) or molecular targeting (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sahai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Somlyo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wolf, 2003</a>). At a finer scale, heterogeneity is also evident within these migration modes, arising either stochastically or as an adaptive response to changing cues (<a href=\"#bib11\">Geiger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">L\u00e4mmermann and Sixt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lock et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Winograd-Katz et al., 2009</a>). Yet, partly due to a lack of adequate quantification, it remains unclear to what extent variation within modes occurs either progressively along a continuum or in a switch-like manner between as yet undefined intra-modal subpopulations. Specifically, in the case of amoeboid migration, three discrete sub-modalities have been observed, and these can co-exist under individual conditions (<a href=\"#bib60\">Welch, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">L\u00e4mmermann and Sixt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yoshida, 2006</a>). By contrast, potentially distinct styles of mesenchymal (lamellipodial) migration, including keratocyte-like (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnhart et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Keren et al., 2008</a>) and fibroblast-like (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abercrombie et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Theisen et al., 2012</a>) migration, have been described as arising largely in separate cell types or conditions. Therefore, despite some early suggestions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lewis et al., 1982</a>), it has remained uncertain to what extent divergent sub-modalities of mesenchymal migration spontaneously emerge in parallel\u00a0within uniform cell populations and conditions, and whether these modes are truly quantitatively distinct, or instead represent extremes in a broad phenotypic continuum. These questions are important because each discrete migration mode, with its unique internal logic and dependencies, may respond differently to altered regulatory cues \u2013 thereby defining a multifaceted adaptive response. Such responses are exemplified by the seminal observation that amoeboid motility provides a compensatory escape route for tumor cells when mesenchymal migration is blocked via inhibition of proteolytic mechanisms or by confinement (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wolf, 2003</a>). Identifying and characterizing such distinct modes within individual cell types and/or conditions may therefore be key to understanding heterogeneity in response to experimental or even clinical interventions."

This adhesion is achieved through the interaction of integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion complexes (CMACs) with ECM ligands, while applied forces are generated by the F-actin cytoskeleton and actomyosin system (<a href=\"#bib11\">Geiger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Humphries et al., 2015</a>). This arrangement defines the ECM \u2013 adhesion \u2013 F-actin axis that directly mediates mesenchymal migration (<a href=\"#bib41\">Parsons et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schwartz, 2010</a>)."

The composition, topology, and density of ECM ligands therefore play key roles in mesenchymal migration (<a href=\"#bib11\">Geiger et al., 2009</a>). Through interaction with integrin tails, talin acts a critical intracellular regulator of integrin activation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Calderwood et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kiss et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Moser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tadokoro, 2003</a>), and is also one of several CMAC proteins linking integrins to the F-actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schwarz and Gardel, 2012</a>). This enables cellular force application from F-actin, through CMACs, to the ECM, thereby driving membrane protrusion/retraction and cell translocation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Small and Resch, 2005</a>). Furthermore, CMACs function both up- and downstream of the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA (<a href=\"#bib44\">Raftopoulou and Hall, 2004</a>), which modulate both F-actin polymerization and actomyosin contractility, the latter through the Rho kinase (ROCK)-mediated regulation of non-muscle myosin II (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ridley, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Riento and Ridley, 2003</a>). In fact, CMACs function as hubs for bi-directional chemical and mechanical information transduction across the plasma membrane, providing command and control of mesenchymal migration (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hynes, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lock et al., 2008</a>)."

Such an approach, generally based on quantitative imaging, is especially effective when multiscale data capturing both cell behavior (migration) and organization (e.g. CMAC and F-actin status) is derived simultaneously on a per cell basis. This facilitates the leveraging of natural or induced heterogeneity to define: i) the statistical structure of variation (e.g. progressive or discrete) within and between cell populations, as well as; ii) key trends, dependencies and relationships within the cell migration system (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lock et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Keren et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kiss et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kowalewski et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ku et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lock and Str\u00f6mblad, 2010</a>). Here, we extend on this approach by employing a tailored analytical toolbox to detect two quantitatively distinct sub-modalities of mesenchymal migration, thus illuminating the discrete nature of variation within this general migration archetype. We employ this unique suite of analytical tools to further characterize key aspects of the behavior, organization, and regulation of these divergent migration strategies. Collectively, this study now provides conceptual and practical capabilities to the cell migration research community, while also highlighting the importance of distinguishing individual mesenchymal migration modes as a vital precursor to understanding mesenchymal migration as a whole."

H1299 P/L cells moved individually and exclusively via mesenchymal (lamellipodial) migration. Nonetheless, we observed and classified two qualitatively different migration modes emerging within the clonally derived H1299 P/L cell population. We termed these migration modes 'Discontinuous' and 'Continuous', reflecting their contrasting stepwise and smooth motion, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Specifically, cells migrating in the Discontinuous mode cycle in sequence through at least three recognizable stages of movement, which we term 'lateral protrusion', 'polarization', and 'tail retraction', as described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> (also see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These stages produce dramatic changes in cell morphology and frequent changes in migratory direction. Such directional changes occur at least in part because lateral protrusions typically develop at approximately 90\u00b0 to the axis of the preceding tail retraction. Overall, the stepwise nature of Discontinuous migration is highly reminiscent of previous descriptions of fibroblast-like migration (<a href=\"#bib59\">Theisen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abercrombie et al., 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen, 1981</a>). By contrast, cells migrating in the Continuous mode move progressively, with less frequent changes in cell morphology and motile direction, in a manner analogous to classical keratocyte-like migration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2)</a> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Keren et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, these migration modes emerge spontaneously in parallel under uniform experimental conditions within a clonally\u00a0derived cell line (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3)</a>. It is noteworthy that cells may traverse the same underlying substrate regions while stably occupying distinct modes (see <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3)</a>, indicating that local environmental inconsistencies are not the principal cause of differential mode identity. Yet, inter-modal conversion is possible, occurring bi-directionally between modes (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>), indicating their profound plasticity."

Automated cell tracking (see 'Materials and methods', [<a href=\"#bib34\">Lock et al., 2014</a>]) revealed that cells in the Discontinuous mode migrate significantly faster than during Continuous migration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). By applying mean squared displacement analysis of cell trajectories to assess measures related to cell speed (migration coefficient) and directionality (persistence time), we found that Discontinuous migration is less directionally stable at any given speed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). However, both modes of migration show a positive correspondence between speed and directionality, as recently reported (<a href=\"#bib37\">Maiuri et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, an extensive comparison of migratory behaviors in several additional cell lines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media11\">11</a>) and during H1299 cell migration on alternative extracellular matrix ligands (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#media12\">Videos 12</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media17\">17</a>) indicated that Discontinuous and Continuous migration modes are consistently recurring phenomena."

We quantitatively compared the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane protrusions and retractions between and within each migration mode based on defining membrane dynamics over the minimal imaging interval of 5 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kowalewski et al., 2015</a>). This revealed that protrusions share similar size (area) distributions in both modes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), while retraction events are more extreme in size during Discontinuous migration, that\u00a0is, more frequently very small or very large (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). When compared within\u00a0each mode, membrane retractions have a broader size distribution than protrusions in the Continuous mode (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), although this is far more striking in the Discontinuous mode (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To investigate membrane dynamics operating over longer time-scales, we calculated the probabilities of protrusions and retractions of a given size based on net cell shape/position changes occurring over intervals of between 1 and 15 image frames (5 to 75 min). This revealed a relatively unstructured pattern of dynamics in Continuous cells, although retractions tended to be smaller and protrusions larger (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In contrast, Discontinuous migration consistently displayed a wide distribution of retraction sizes (very small and very large), with protrusion sizes uniformly moderate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Notably, the relatively high probability of very large retraction events in Discontinuous cells corresponds with their observed tendency to undergo dramatic tail retraction events. Collectively, these results explain the spatial characteristics underlying stepwise or smooth cell motion during migration in Discontinuous or Continuous modes, respectively."

In marked contrast, two cross-correlation peaks were apparent in the Discontinuous mode, with one peak stable around the -1 time-lag (tightly coupled dynamics), and a second peak temporally offset with positive lags (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). This offset was dependent on the time frame used to define membrane dynamics, but clearly indicates a population of temporally decoupled membrane dynamics, wherein retraction leads protrusion events that are significantly delayed. This confirmed the visual impression of Discontinuous migration as a cyclical, stepwise process with asynchronous retraction (i.e. tail retraction stage) preceding protrusion (i.e. lateral protrusion stage). In contrast, the morphological stability observed during Continuous migration is a consequence of the tight coupling of protrusion and retraction, producing motility without large-scale, transient size/shape changes. Visual impressions also suggested the Discontinuous migration mode to be less ordered/coordinated than the Continuous mode. The significantly lower average (combining all time-lags) protrusion-retraction cross-correlation values during Discontinuous migration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>) confirmed reduced coordination of membrane dynamics in this migration mode."

This multiscale organizational data was measured per cell, per time-point, thereby complementing corresponding measures of migration behavior from the same individual cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We next visualized these organizational states via parallel coordinate mapping of 15 key organizational features (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This revealed specific instances of dissimilarity in feature values as well as an overview of the collective organizational signatures associated with each mode. To estimate the contribution of specific features to the divergence between modes, we ranked organizational features by the coefficient values assigned to them within the first canonical vector of the CVA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We then compared feature value distributions between modes for a subset of these top-ranked features, finding highly significant differences in all cases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013K</a>). These analyses help to define the spectrum of differences in organization that spontaneously arise in parallel with the emergence of Discontinuous and Continuous migration mode behaviors. For instance, cells in the Discontinuous mode are: far smaller; less round (more protrusive); have fewer, smaller, less dense CMACs (based on EGFP-paxillin intensity) with less F-actin association (based on background-subtracted RubyRed-LifeAct intensity [<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2010</a>]) and shorter lifetimes (less stable), resulting in a drastically decreased total adhesion area."

We next explored how these differences might translate into systemic dissimilarities in the coupling of cell behavior (i.e. cell migration speed) and cell organization within each mode. To this end, we first grouped cell observations according to both migration mode and tertiles of cell speed (0\u221233% [slow]; 33\u221266% [medium]; 66\u2212100% [fast]). We then performed supervised CVA clustering of these groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This enabled assessment of how cells in each mode cluster in the multivariate cell state space, but also of the trajectories defined through cell state space given variability in cell migration speed (as described previously, [<a href=\"#bib34\">Lock et al., 2014</a>]) <i>within each mode</i>. As also observed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> (based on similar but not equivalent clustering), we found that cells in Discontinuous or Continuous modes cluster separately. However, in a striking extension of this result, we also found that variability in migration speed within each mode corresponded to completely independent trajectories in cell state space. This means that different patterns of organizational remodeling are associated with varying cell speed within each mode. Thus, profound differences exist between modes in terms of the underlying strategies that produce and control cell migration speed."

We therefore assessed whether directed modulation of these features could drive corresponding and predictable changes in the frequency equilibrium between migration modes. To test for such bottom-up regulation, we applied a selection of targeted molecular perturbations for which we and others have established prior knowledge regarding their effects on the organizational features in question.

Talin knock-down promoted Discontinuous migration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We then compared: i) spontaneous differences in feature values between Continuous and Discontinuous migration modes (displayed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E,G and I</a>); ii) perturbation-induced differences in the same features (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>); and iii) perturbation effects on migration mode frequencies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). From this matrix of results, we were able to determine whether a logical coherence was preserved over all these measures. For example, median CMAC Area was spontaneously higher in cells during Continuous migration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>), and increasing ECM ligand concentration (FN) causes higher CMAC Area values (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, upper left panel). It is therefore logically consistent (<i>if CMAC Area and migration mode behaviors are functionally coupled</i>) that raising ECM ligand concentration increases the frequency of the Continuous migration mode (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, upper panel). In fact, although the applied perturbations produce differing effects on CMAC Area (increasing or decreasing), migration mode frequencies show logically consistent responses in each case. CMAC Area therefore appears likely to be closely coupled to migration mode identity, since there is no evidence that CMAC Area and migration mode identity could be uncoupled. Such coherence was also observed for CMAC Lifetime and Cell Compactness, thus similarly supporting their functional coupling to migration mode determination. In contrast, while the modulation of either ECM ligand concentration or talin 1 expression caused effects on Cell Area and CMAC Number that were consistent with their parallel effects on mode frequencies, ROCK inhibition caused contradictory results: CMAC number and Cell Area were both higher in cells in the Continuous mode (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) and were increased following ROCK inhibition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, lower right panel), yet ROCK-inhibition caused a decreased frequency of the Continuous mode (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lower panel). These results imply that, although Cell Area and CMAC Number spontaneously correlate with migration mode identities under the original experimental condition, this correspondence can be uncoupled. These organizational features are therefore unlikely to be causal of, or caused by, migration mode identity determination."

More definitively, these results effectively exclude Cell Area and CMAC Number from being (linearly) causally linked to this process. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the potent regulatory influence of the specific molecular components fibronectin, talin 1 and ROCK, on migration mode determination. These perturbations also allows us to conclude more broadly that cell-matrix adhesion complexes and actomyosin contractility play key roles in shaping Discontinuous and Continuous mode frequencies."

However, it remained unclear to what extent perturbation effects on organizational features may reflect: a) mode frequency changes (inter-modal 'adaptive switching'), as opposed to b) organizational remodeling of the modes themselves (intra-modal 'adaptive stretching'). To address the balance between these two adaptive responses, we leveraged data from the comparison of low (2.5 \u00b5g/ml) and high (10 \u00b5g/ml) FN concentrations displayed in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. Using only organizational features, we performed principal component analysis (PCA)-based unsupervised clustering of cell observations grouped by both FN concentration and migration mode (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Surprisingly, this revealed that the distances (in PCA-defined cell state space) between Discontinuous and Continuous migration modes were far greater than the distances induced within each mode by FN concentration variation. Comparing the heterogeneity of individual cells over time (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B and C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and the distances between migration mode centers of mass confirmed the substantial nature of average organizational differences between modes (equal to or greater than the maximal span of variation observed over 8 hr in the individual cells shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013C</a>). To more intuitively visualize how changing FN concentration shifts the distribution of cell organization within the PCA-defined cell state space (and between modes), we calculated the probability density distributions of cell observations in each mode, for each experimental condition (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013E</a>). This revealed that cell observations in each mode populate high probability-density 'valleys' that are at least partially separated by low probability-density 'ridges'. This visualization also emphasized that the major response to FN modulation was a substantial rebalancing of cell organizational states from one valley (migration mode) to the other. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that switching (between modes) dominates over stretching (remodeling within modes) as an adaptive response to FN concentration modulation. The conceptual relation between these two mechanisms of adaptation in cell state space is schematized in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>."

By deploying these tools, we quantitatively demonstrate that mesenchymal migration is composed of two distinct sub-modalities, each with specific behavioral, organizational, and regulatory characteristics. This marks an important advance that may enhance future investigations of the mesenchymal migration archetype. In particular, interpretations of natural and/or experimentally induced variability will likely become more coherent and precise if data are disaggregated according to Discontinuous or Continuous modes, rather than being unintentionally aggregated across cells with fundamentally different properties and dependencies. Recognition of these modes may therefore facilitate a more accurate understanding of the heterogeneity, adaptability, and regulation of mesenchymal migration as a whole."

Crucially, the same distinctive behaviors emerged in parallel within a variety of cell lines and under a spectrum of conditions, thus supporting the robustness and broad relevance of these behaviors. Yet, given the similarity of Continuous and Discontinuous migrations to previous descriptions of keratocyte-like (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnhart et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Keren et al., 2008</a>) or fibroblast-like motility (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abercrombie et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Theisen et al., 2012</a>), respectively, the existence of these behaviors per\u00a0se\u00a0is not novel. Indeed, early observations even qualitatively suggest the co-existence of similar behaviors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lewis et al., 1982</a>). However, we now present quantitative evidence of the spontaneous, parallel emergence of two distinct yet inter-convertible mesenchymal migration modes, wherein divergent couplings exist between behavioral (speed) and organizational characteristics. We thereby provide new insights into the discontinuous structure of heterogeneity within the broad mesenchymal migration archetype. Indeed, by differentiating between progressive (intra-modal) and discrete (inter-modal) forms of variation, we gained the capacity to compare the roles that these two mechanisms play in adaptive responses to perturbation. Surprisingly, this revealed that adaptive switching between modes is the dominant response to perturbation (FN concentration modulation), with adaptive stretching (remodelling) within modes playing only a minor role."

Precisely, the high probability-density 'valleys' near the center of mass of each mode contrast with the low probability-density 'ridges' at the boundaries between modes. Importantly, these probability-density distributions are not predetermined outcomes of such PCA clustering, since PCA is unsupervised with respect to mode identity. In fact, these topologies are suggestive of a system comprised of two attractor states (<a href=\"#bib15\">Huang and Ingber, 2000</a>), whose basins of attraction diverge on either side of a set of potentially unstable or unfavorable configurations. The low probability of these boundary configurations effectively divides mesenchymal migration into two independent sub-modalities. Such attractor states have been described in relation to, for example: gene expression during development and tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Huang, 2009</a>); cell signaling during motility (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2015</a>); and even in the force-coupled dynamics of CMACs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hern\u00e1ndez-Varas et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, the attractor state concept appears analogous to the concept of prespecification originally proposed by Friedl to explain the robust, recurrent and yet switchable characteristics of mesenchymal and amoeboid migration modes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Friedl, 2004</a>). Interestingly, the limited remodelling within Discontinuous and Continuous modes in response to FN modulation (as opposed to mode switching) suggests that these modes may be relatively inflexible, providing additional support for their proposed status as prespecified attractor states."

In addition, this approach also provided a fourth compelling line of evidence by revealing completely independent trajectories through cell state space defined by cells migrating at different speeds within each mode. Remarkably, this indicates that changes in cell speed within each mode were coupled to substantially different patterns of organizational remodelling. These systemic differences were composed in part by specific disparities in Spearman\u2019s correlations between individual organizational features and cell speed within each mode. While a variety of differences were observed, most striking were instances where correlations to cell speed were inverted between modes, such as in the case of adhesion stability (CMAC lifetime) \u2013 a critical parameter previously linked to causal regulation of cell speed (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lock et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, when comparing modes, the independent patterns of cell speed-coupled reorganization arose despite only subtle differences across the entire network of inter-feature Spearman\u2019s correlations. Indeed, these differences in correlation values were far more limited than would be expected at random, suggesting that a select few features and relationships may control migration mode identity."

This is in contrast to the study of mitosis, where automated classification has already proven to be a powerful research tool (<a href=\"#bib40\">Neumann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schmitz et al., 2010</a>). It is likely that this reflects differences in the degree and structure of heterogeneity in these biological processes. For example, mitosis is a relatively stereotyped process - both morphologically and particularly in the terms of the temporal ordering of events. Both characteristics can increase the accuracy of automated classification approaches (<a href=\"#bib13\">Held et al., 2010</a>). While cell migration is also more (e.g. Discontinuous mode) or less (e.g. Continuous mode) a globally time-ordered process, the underlying events appear far less stereotypical. Given these challenges, we have employed a blinded manual classification approach in this study. However, we note that the CVA clustering results \u2013 even excluding behavioral features (as herein) \u2013 provide evidence that automated classification of migration modes may be feasible in future.

This revealed that the major differences between modes were: the size of membrane retraction events; the order and temporal coupling of protrusion and retraction events; and the coordination displayed between protrusive and retractive dynamics. Specifically, cells in the Discontinuous mode produced many very small and occasional very large retraction events, with these retractions tending to lead protrusion, reversing the order detected in Continuous cells. A large time delay also exists between retraction and subsequent protrusion dynamics in Discontinuous cells, and these dynamics are less coordinated (lower cross-correlation). Such substantial differences in membrane dynamics (especially the inversion of protrusion and retraction orders) further support the distinct nature of Discontinuous and Continuous migration modes. Furthermore, these analyses both confirmed and explained the visual impressions that originally differentiated Discontinuous from Continuous migration. In addition, given the strong correspondence between retraction (but not protrusion) size and cell speed, these analyses now add migration mode and cell speed to motility initiation as aspects of migration where membrane retraction appears to be the deterministic membrane process (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnhart et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kowalewski et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cramer, 2010</a>)."

This demonstrated that each of these molecular factors plays a key role in shaping the equilibrium between modes. Furthermore, these molecular targets also regulate generic characteristics of the pivotal ECM \u2013 adhesion \u2013 F-actin axis, including: integrin ligation (FN concentration); integrin activation and clustering (talin expression); integrin \u2013 F-actin linkage (talin expression); and actomyosin contractility (ROCK signaling).

It is noteworthy that both modes emerge under conditions that are distinct from those that favour amoeboid migration (i.e. low adhesion and high contractility). Therefore, the switch between Continuous and Discontinuous (mesenchymal) migration modes clearly contrasts to the previously identified conversion between mesenchymal and amoeboid migration. This emphasizes the multifaceted adaptive capacity of migrating cells, which likely expands the contexts within which efficient migration is possible. This plasticity is highlighted by the growing variety of distinct migration modalities now recognized (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>)."

This provides a first step in parsing correlated features from those with significant causal influence over migration mode identity. Specifically, it is notable that CMAC Area and CMAC Lifetime were previously indicated to causally influence cell migration speed (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lock et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim and Wirtz, 2013</a>), while Cell Compactness was causally downstream of cell speed (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lock et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the evidence that these features may be functionally coupled to the determination of migration mode identity is consistent with them being integral to migratory regulation. Conversely, we previously found that Cell Area showed no causal relationship to cell speed (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lock et al., 2014</a>), and this is again consistent with it being functionally uncoupled from the process of mode identity determination. Overall, three types of insight were revealed through these perturbation-based analyses, including: the regulatory roles of specific molecules (fibronectin, talin and ROCK); the putative influence of generic regulatory mechanisms; and the nature of links (coupled vs uncoupled) between migration mode identity and commonly measured macromolecular features. Nonetheless, much remains to be learned about the proximal and distal determinants of these migration modes."

We thereby characterized two quantitatively distinct migration modes, here termed Continuous and Discontinuous migrations, that co-exist within the broad mesenchymal migration archetype. We compared these migration modes in terms of: their motion and behavioral dynamics; the specific and systemic organization of key machineries (CMACs and F-actin) underlying their motility, and; differences in how behavior (migration speed) and organization co-evolve within each mode. Through targeted molecular perturbations, we defined both specific molecular and general mechanisms of bottom-up control over migration mode determination, while also beginning to parse potentially functional (coupled) relationships (between features and modes) from those that are correlated but non-functional (uncoupled). Finally, our systemic analysis of adaptive responses to perturbation has revealed how discrete mechanisms (inter-modal adaptive switching) dominate over progressive remodeling (intra-modal adaptive stretching). This study therefore emphasize the importance of distinguishing and comprehending Discontinuous and Continuous migration modes as a necessary precursor to understanding mesenchymal migration in its totality, while simultaneously providing tools and approaches that enable this endeavor."

Images were acquired for 8\u201310 hr at 5 min intervals with a pixel resolution of 0.21 \u00b5m. Long-term (16 hr at 5-min intervals), low resolution imaging to monitor for inter-modal transitions was performed on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope using a Plan Apo \u03b3 20X/0.75 NA air objective and resonance scanner, producing a pixel resolution of 0.82 \u00b5m. 3\u00d73 or 4\u00d74 image montages were acquired and stitched. Prior to imaging, cells were labeled at 1:5000 with a far-red membrane dye (Cell Mask Deep Red, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr and throughout imaging. Normal culture medium minus fetal bovine serum was used during all imaging, and cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>."

Briefly, cell boundaries were detected using the RubyRed-LifeAct signal. Cells touching the image border in any given time frame were excluded. Within each segmented cell, CMACs greater than 0.05 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> in area were segmented based on EGFP-Paxillin signal. Segmented cells and CMACs were then tracked based on nearest neighbor analysis. Cell trajectories were smoothed using smoothing splines. CMACs were excluded where tracking did not contain at least three consecutive time points. CMACs present in the first and last frames of each image sequence were excluded from the calculation of CMAC Lifetime. All segmentation and tracking was manually inspected and iteratively optimized through parameter tuning. Quantitative features characterizing cell, CMAC, and CMAC-associated F-actin properties were then extracted (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). CMAC intensity values per channel were corrected by subtraction of mean intensity values in a 1 \u00b5m radius around the CMAC, excluding other segmented CMACs. CMAC intensity data were further standardized per experimental repeat relative to the median value of CMAC intensities in the size range between 0.15 and 0.2 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> within the low FN no INH condition. Cell motion was characterized by instantaneous cell speed or via analysis of mean squared displacement (MSD). Mean square displacement (MSD) was calculated using a moving window as previously described (<a href=\"#bib21\">Khorshidi et al., 2011</a>). The window size was set to 24 frames (2 hr). The first 12 time lags (<i>t</i><sub>lag</sub>), up to 1 hr, of the MSD were fitted to Furth\u2019s formula:"

Briefly, consecutive segmented images were compared to define protrusions (new pixels in cell segment compared to previous frame) and retractions (pixels lost from cell segment compared to previous frame). To explore dynamics over different time frames, images separated by different intervals were assessed using the same criteria, establishing time window samplings of between 5 min (1 frame) and 75 min (15 frames). Subtraction of protrusion and retraction size probability distributions was performed as described previously for other feature probability distributions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kiss et al., 2015</a>). Analysis of cross-correlation between protrusion and retraction areas over time was performed on a per cell sequence basis using the Matlab function xcov. Missing values were replaced by the mean value of protrusion/retraction area for that cell trajectory. Time lags of between \u221260 min (\u221212 frames) and 60 min (+12 frames) were assessed, with negative lags indicating that protrusion dynamics lead retraction dynamics, and positive lags indicating that retraction dynamics lead protrusion dynamics. To summarize the mean absolute cross-correlation per migration mode, cross-correlation values at all lags (\u221260 to 60 min; \u221212 to 12 frames) were averaged for each time window (5 min to 75 min; 1 to 15 frames), per cell, and then averaged per condition. Nienty-five\u00a0percent confidence intervals were calculated per time window size. Friedman testing based on distinct cell numbers defined statistically discernable differences in mean protrusion-retraction cross-correlation between modes across the sampled time windows. All membrane dynamics analyses were performed in Matlab (vR2013b, The Mathworks)."

Feature selection via CVA was performed by ranking absolute feature weighting coefficients from the first canonical vector (CV1). Unsupervised multivariate clustering using principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using singular value decomposition of the normalized data matrix. Probability density surfaces were calculated using a Gaussian kernel density estimation of significantly smaller scale that the overall mode distributions, and hence does not dictate the 'valley' shape of these distributions \u2013 rather this is a reflection of the true value distribution. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients were calculated based on feature values per cell observation. Estimation of the expected distribution of random absolute value changes in Spearman\u2019s correlation between modes was performed by permuting the identity of correlation values in one mode while holding the other constant. This was repeated 100 times and the cumulative distribution function of all differences is displayed. Pairwise testing for differences in feature distributions (boxplots, parallel coordinates) was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (equivalent to Mann-Whitney test) given all cell observations. Analyses and visualizations described above were performed in Matlab (The Mathworks). Parallel coordinates-based visualization of selected feature values in each migration mode was generated using Knime (v2.12.00, KNIME.com, Zurich, Switzerland). Parallel coordinates-based comparison of Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients between Cell Speed and selected features, as well as visualization of coefficient differences between modes, were generated using R (v3.2.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and RStudio (v0.98.945, RStudio, Boston, MA)."

However, it is clear that not all mesenchymal cells migrate with the same morphological features. In this elegant, unbiased study Loch and co-workers describe two distinct modes on mesenchymal migration: continuous and discontinuous. The distinction is based on their high-though put microscopy and cutting edge image and statistical analyses of different migratory features. They define distinct features like cell adhesion number, localization and duration and their association with one of the two different migration modes. Furthermore, the dependency of the migration modes to perturbations of integrin activity, ECM ligand density and cell contractility are assessed in detail."

This manuscript seeks to address this challenging question by using a combination of imaging and computational approaches to carefully characterize two types of mesenchymal cell migration defined here as continuous and discontinuous. Following a series of very careful comparisons of speed, persistence, protrusion dynamics, adhesion size, and F-actin intensity, for example, as well as comprehensive pairwise correlations between all of the parameters measured, they conclude that mesenchymal cells migrating on a two-dimensional tissue culture surface switch stochastically between distinct modes of migration (defined by an ensemble of cell-intrinsic parameters) in response to perturbations in cell-matrix adhesion and ROCK signaling, rather than using a continuous spectrum of migration mechanisms where each cell-intrinsic parameter can change independently. This conclusion is supported by the data presented and their discussion point that the presence of distinct migration mechanisms within population of cells need to be accounted for remains timely. It is difficult, however, to identify a clear conceptual advance resulting from this work or new information regarding the molecular mechanisms of cell movement."

For example, Figure 4C shows that the correlation between only a small subset of cell parameters changes significantly between the continuous and discontinuous modes. Identifying what those parameters are and if they actually caused the motility differences could be a way to leverage this data set to make new discoveries about the mechanisms regulating cell migration plasticity.

But, just as cells may differentiate along various trajectories \u2013 even in artificial conditions \u2013 we posit that these distinct modes reflect pre-specified cellular (attractor) states that have evolved to provide necessary plasticity to cells, given the diverse challenges they meet in vivo. While this remains to be confirmed, we believe that the robustness, reproducibility and recurrence (in various conditions and cells types) of these modes, supports the possibility that they have physiological relevance."

This concept is consistent with our finding that Continuous mesenchymal migration was favored (more frequent) upon strong adhesion and full contraction, while the Discontinuous mode dominated upon low adhesion and inhibited contraction. Thus, each of these conditions is distinct from those favoured by other known migration modes, e.g. amoebic migration (which occurs upon low adhesion and high contraction). The existence of the two mesenchymal modes may therefore expand the range of conditions within which the cells can migrate efficiently."

Identifying what those parameters are and if they actually caused the motility differences could be a way to leverage this data set to make new discoveries about the mechanisms regulating cell migration plasticity. Without this type of new mechanistic information I suggest the work might be more suited to be presented as a methods type paper.</i>"

Very important is to highlight that the authors themselves accept in the Discussion that the existence of these two modes is not new and not even the co-existence of them. Please highlight more the quantitative information that you can extract and how this information can be correlated with responses to perturbation and the plasticity of cells to adapt to new conditions.</i>"
