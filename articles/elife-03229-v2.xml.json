To dissect the chemical signals and the genes mediating this association, we investigated the effect of an oriental beetle sex pheromone on the development and behavior of the nematode <i>Pristionchus pacificus</i>. We found that while the beetle pheromone is attractive to <i>P. pacificus</i> adults, the pheromone arrests embryo development, paralyzes J2 larva, and inhibits exit of dauer larvae. To uncover the mechanism that regulates insect pheromone sensitivity, a newly identified mutant, <i>Ppa-obi-1</i>, is used to reveal the molecular links between altered attraction towards the beetle pheromone, as well as hypersensitivity to its paralyzing effects. <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> encodes lipid-binding domains and reaches its highest expression in various cell types, including the amphid neuron sheath and excretory cells. Our data suggest that the beetle host pheromone may be a species-specific volatile synomone that co-evolved with necromeny."

To dissect the chemical signals and the genes mediating this association, we investigated the effect of an oriental beetle sex pheromone on the development and behavior of the nematode <i>Pristionchus pacificus</i>. We found that while the beetle pheromone is attractive to <i>P. pacificus</i> adults, the pheromone arrests embryo development, paralyzes J2 larva, and inhibits exit of dauer larvae. To uncover the mechanism that regulates insect pheromone sensitivity, a newly identified mutant, <i>Ppa-obi-1</i>, is used to reveal the molecular links between altered attraction towards the beetle pheromone, as well as hypersensitivity to its paralyzing effects. <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> encodes lipid-binding domains and reaches its highest expression in various cell types, including the amphid neuron sheath and excretory cells. Our data suggest that the beetle host pheromone may be a species-specific volatile synomone that co-evolved with necromeny."

For example, the genes responsible for fruit and bacterial odor preferences in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> are most informative when considering the natural ecologies in rotting fruits and vegetation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bargmann et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bargmann, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kiontke and Sudhaus, 2006</a>). In <i>Pristionchus pacificus</i>, an emerging model organism for the study of development and behavior (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hong and Sommer, 2006b</a>), a systematic effort to identify the natural ecology of <i>Pristionchus</i> nematodes revealed that <i>P. pacificus</i> host preferences include the oriental beetle (<i>Exomala orientalis</i>) found in Japan and northeastern United States (<a href=\"#bib19\">Herrmann et al., 2007</a>). Unlike several fructivorous <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species, <i>Pristionchus</i> species are considered to be necromenic nematodes that have species-specific beetle host preferences and feed on the microorganisms that emerge from the beetle carcass (<a href=\"#bib20\">Herrmann et al., 2006a</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2011</a>). <i>Pristionchus</i> species are members of the Diplogasteridae family of nematodes whose common ancestor with the Rhabditidae family (<i>e.g., C. elegans</i>) diverged \u223c300 million years ago (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dieterich et al., 2008</a>). Given that beetles (Coleoptera) represent a group with the most described species, the possibility that most beetle species can harbor specific entomophilic nematode associations underscores the vast number of nematode species remaining to be described. Although biologists have been aware of such species-specific insect\u2013nematode associations for some time, the genetic basis for such interactions remains largely unknown."

For example, <i>Pristionchus maupasi</i> associates primarily with the European May beetle <i>Melolontha</i> spp. and is attracted to the blend of the green leaf alcohol from plants and the phenol pheromone from beetles (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hong et al., 2008b</a>). Thus, insect and plant odors can synergize to provide nematodes with information on host presence, sex, and maturity. By contrast, <i>C. elegans</i> attractants such as 2,3-butanedione (diacetyl), 2,3-pentanedione, and isoamyl alcohol are significantly less attractive to <i>P. pacificus</i> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bargmann et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hong and Sommer, 2006a</a>). This piggybacking of intra-species communication for inter-species interactions between <i>Pristionchus</i> and beetles can also evolve rapidly at the population level, as exhibited by the natural variation of <i>P. pacificus</i> odor preference for insect pheromones (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hong et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McGaughran et al., 2013b</a>). In particular, <i>P. pacificus</i> Washington strain (PS1843) is attracted to the lepidopteran sex pheromone <i>E</i>-11-tetradecenyl acetate (ETDA) and the oriental beetle sex pheromone <i>z</i>-7-tetradece-2-one (ZTDO) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Herrmann et al., 2007</a>), but the wild-type reference strain from California (PS312) requires exogenous cGMP treatment to become attracted to these insect pheromones (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hong et al., 2008a</a>). These natural variations in insect pheromone attraction, combined with regional-specific <i>P. pacificus</i> host preferences, may offer support for the geographic mosaic theory of co-evolution (<a href=\"#bib45\">Thompson, 2005</a>)."

For example, the pinewood nematode <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i> is intimately associated with its <i>Monochamus</i> beetle vector, and fatty acid ethyl esters exuded during beetle eclosion promote the formation of the dispersal fourth larval stage <i>B. xylophilus</i> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, the species-specific phoretic association between the burrower bug <i>Parastrachia japonensis</i> and the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis japonica</i> may be mediated by the beetle cuticular compounds that not only attract <i>C. japonica</i> but also assist infestation by inhibiting <i>C. japonica</i> dispersal (<a href=\"#bib36\">Okumura et al., 2013</a>). <i>P. pacificus</i> populations have been found on various beetle hosts worldwide, but the association with the oriental beetle was the first to be identified and the only one whose sex pheromone is a strong attractant (<a href=\"#bib19\">Herrmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McGaughran et al., 2013b</a>). Therefore, the oriental beetle sex pheromone represents the single most ecologically relevant semiochemical by which we could repeatedly interrogate the <i>P. pacificus</i> genes involved for host sensing and other unexplored developmental roles."

We leveraged the ability to use exogenous cGMP to potentiate the California reference strain for ZTDO attraction to find additional genes important for ZTDO sensitivity by performing an unbiased forward genetic screen for mutants with altered responses to ZTDO. We found that a putative lipid-binding protein <i>Ppa-</i>OBI-1 mediates both beetle pheromone attraction as well as a previously unknown role of the beetle pheromone to regulate <i>P. pacificus</i> development. Our results suggest that the host pheromone may play a complex role in reducing infection or coordinating development for the dispersal cycle of the necromenic lifestyle."

Interestingly, the Washington strain that has natural cGMP-independent attraction to ZTDO was more resistant to 0.25\u20130.50% ZTDO than the ZTDO-insensitive California strain. Although ZTDO exposure had no noticeable effect on egg laying output by adult hermaphrodites, eggs continuously exposed to ZTDO for 2 days at an early stage remain arrested at the pre-comma globular embryonic stage, before gastrulation. The embryocidal effect of ZTDO was concentration-dependent and species-specific, since wild-type <i>C. elegans</i> eggs were completely unaffected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> hypersensitivity to the developmental and paralyzing effects of ZTDO also continued into the subsequent J2 and J4 larval stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Both wild-type PS312 and <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> J2 larvae exhibited ZTDO-induced paralysis, while the Washington strain was significantly more resistant to paralysis. However, by the J4 larval stage, only <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> was sensitive to ZTDO compared to both wild-type <i>P. pacificus</i> strains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>). <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> J4 larvae exposed to ZTDO displayed initial agitation, followed by full body paralysis between 90 and 120 min. In contrast, wild-type <i>C. elegans</i> J4 larvae displayed only minute sensitivity to ZTDO. To determine if the <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> mutation renders it susceptible to paralysis from other insect pheromones, we also tested the moth pheromone ETDA and found that the J4 larvae of <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> and the wild-type strains were not affected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). All strains, including <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404),</i> were insensitive to ZTDO-induced paralysis when they reach adulthood (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), the dominant stage used in our chemotaxis assays. Taken together, our findings show that ZTDO is capable of arresting wild-type <i>P. pacificus</i> embryogenesis and severely paralyzing J2 larvae, indicating that ZTDO is a potential host-specific developmental regulator. We speculate that wild-type <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 may serve to protect <i>P. pacificus</i> embryos and reproductive larvae against the volatile anesthetic-like effects of ZTDO from the adult beetle host."

To explore the possibility that ZTDO also acts to restrain the dispersive stage of <i>P. pacificus</i> development after hatching, we asked if ZTDO can also regulate DL exit in the presence of food using culturing plates containing 0.001\u20130.01% ZTDO and bacteria. Nearly all untreated wild-type <i>P. pacificus</i> DL developed into J4 larvae after 2 days on food, whereas \u223c40% of the wild-type worms remained as active DL on 0.01% ZTDO with OP50 food that would have otherwise promoted reproductive development (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). However for <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> DL, this dauer exit defect is exacerbated by ZTDO due to paralysis. Approximately 80% of the developmentally blocked <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> DL show immobility on 0.001% ZTDO, and nearly 95% of the <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> DL became paralyzed on 0.01% ZTDO. Although DL is the primary infective stage in many entomophilic nematodes found on live beetles (<a href=\"#bib48\">Weller et al., 2010</a>), we were unable to assess DL's chemotaxis response to ZTDO because of its immobilizing effect on DL. The negative regulation of DL exit by ZTDO is specific to <i>P. pacificus</i> and barely affected <i>C. elegans</i> even at 0.01% ZTDO. These results show that 0.01% ZTDO can block active wild-type <i>P. pacificus</i> DL from progressing to the reproductive stage without causing paralysis, but 0.001\u20130.01% ZTDO significantly reduced dauer exit in <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> DL by primarily inducing paralysis and death."

The <i>Ppa-egl-4(tu374)</i> mutation did not, however, reduce the ZTDO inhibition of DL exit in the presence of a higher amount of 0.01% ZTDO.

While the loss of <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> alone can cause reduced rate of DL exit on food independent of ZTDO, the aggravated DL arrest by ZTDO in <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> is partially mediated by Ppa-<i>egl-4.</i>"

Using molecular markers and the slim phenotype, we were able to delineate the <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> lesion to an \u223c138 kb region on Supercontig 1 of chromosome I between markers SSLP21 and SSLP17 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We subsequently identified all polymorphic sites between PS312 and <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> in the fine mapping interval by Illumina whole genome sequencing and focused on disruptions of predicted open reading frames. We found a single base pair deletion in a predicted coding region orthologous to <i>C06G1.1</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> and confirmed this <i>tu404</i> deletion by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of both wild type and <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> genomic and cDNA. The <i>tu404</i> allele contains a single base pair deletion in exon 9. The resulting frame shift and nonsense mutation are predicted to stop translation half way into the reading frame to result in a hypomorphic allele. In the two <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> splice forms, the longer transcript contains a VKDDDPR peptide that may be the result of an alternative splice donor site. Both splice variants were isolated from the California and Washington strains in equal abundance by sub-cloning RT-PCR products (data not shown), and no differences in nucleotide sequence were found in the coding region of these two strains. Therefore, splice form variation in <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 is unlikely to contribute to the difference in insect pheromone attraction between these two strains.

Lastly, we tested the ability of the wild-type <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> transgene to reduce the ZTDO hypersensitivity and found that it significantly reduced the percentage of ZTDO-induced paralysis in <i>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</i> J4 larvae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> therefore mediates ZTDO chemosensation, body dimensions, and ZTDO susceptibility."

The LBP/BPI/CETP/PTLP family in humans is known to play a role in immunological responses to bacterial pathogens and mediate the transfer of cholesteryl ester and triglycerides in the blood plasma (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bruce et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kawano et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schultz and Weiss, 2007</a>). <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 and C06G1.1 each contain two predicted lipid-binding domains as well as a predicted secretion peptide sequence in the N-terminal regions (PFAM and SMART; SignalP 4.0 Server) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To identify all members of the LBP family in the sequenced genome and transcriptome of <i>P. pacificus</i>, we performed reciprocal BLASTP searches (WormBase WS221), which indicated 12 members predicted to be encoded in the <i>P. pacificus</i> genome. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the OBI-1/C06G1.1 LBP protein family indicates 10 closely related orthologous pairs in the two species. Interestingly, the lengths of the branches suggest that all the orthologs between <i>P. pacificus</i> and <i>C. elegans</i> share similar divergence times, with the exception of the OBI-1/C06G1.1 pair that seemed to have undergone faster divergence relative to other paralogs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with their roles in immune response in mammals, a member of the LBP family in <i>C. elegans</i>, F44A2.3, was found to be up-regulated in response to several species of pathogenic bacteria (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wong et al., 2007</a>). Another <i>C. elegans</i> LBP member, NRF-5, is partially necessary for nose contraction in response to the anti-depressant fluoxetine (Prozac) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choy et al., 2006</a>), and for mediating phosphatidylserine transfer from apoptotic cells to engulfing cells during cell corpse removal (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). We found that <i>nrf-5(sa513)</i> mutants are also defective in attraction to 2,3-butanedione (diacetyl), and isoamyl alcohol, although the <i>C06G1.1(vc20357)</i> allele with a missense mutation did not show chemosensory defects (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Our analysis was based on a stably integrated transgenic line <i>csuIs01</i> and parsimonious inferences to homologous <i>C. elegans</i> cell positions and known cellular functions. Detailed analyses of all developmental stages show that the earliest <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> expression occurs in at least one cell in the pre-comma embryonic stage but soon disappears until weak expression reappears in the hyp7 and seam cells in J4 larvae (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The most robust and diverse <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> expression was found in mid-J4 hermaphrodites, which is consistent with real-time quantitative PCR results indicating that transcript levels in J2 and J3 larvae are less than in J4 larvae (data not shown). In the mid-J4 stage, <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> is strongly expressed in the major hypodermal syncytium and the lateral hypodermal cells that cover most of the body (hyp7 and seam cells) as well as the ventral tail (hyp 8 and 9) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

While small changes in sequence can lead to large changes in protein function, the absence of expression of the <i>C. elegans obi-1</i> ortholog in amphid sheath cells suggests that changes in gene expression pattern may also play a role in determining ZTDO sensitivity. We therefore sought to determine if the <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> ortholog <i>C06G1.1</i> have shared tissue expression with <i>Ppa-obi-1</i>. We examined endogenous <i>C06G1.1p::gfp</i> expression in <i>C. elegans</i> in five independent transgenic lines with extrachromosomal arrays and found strong mid-L4 larvae expression in the seam cells, two tail hypodermal cells, four cells in the excretory duct system (duct, excretory, gland cells), vulval muscles, and possible IL or OLQ sheath or socket neuronal support cells similar to the expression pattern observed for <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>). In contrast to the earliest <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> expression in pre-comma stage, <i>C06G1.1</i> expression is detectable during late embryogenesis in putative seam cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). This seam cell expression is earlier than <i>Ppa-obi-1p::gfp</i> in the L1 stage, and is maintained until the young adult stage. A reason for this earlier seam cell expression could be that the equivalent <i>P. pacificus</i> J1 larvae remain inside the egg while <i>C. elegans</i> eggs hatch as L1 larvae (<a href=\"#bib16\">F\u00fcrst von Lieven, 2005</a>). Like <i>Ppa-obi-1</i>, <i>C06G1.1</i> expression is largely absent in all tissue types when the transgenic animals become 1-day old adult hermaphrodites, coinciding with the fusion of seam cells into a syncytium. This observation indicates that <i>C06G1.1</i> expression in the excretory and epithelial system may be coordinated and involved in seam cell development."

In addition to differences in gene expression pattern, the possibility that there is a ZTDO receptor that interacts with <i>Ppa-</i>OBI-1 in <i>P. pacificus</i> but not in <i>C. elegans</i> may also help to explain how <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> orthologues confer different ZTDO sensitivities in the two species during certain developmental stages. To explore yet another possibility that changes in both protein function and expression may lead to differences in ZTDO sensitivity, we expressed the <i>Ppa-obi-1:cDNA</i> under the <i>C. elegans</i> amphid sheath cell-specific promoters <i>T02B11.3</i> and <i>F16F9.3</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bacaj et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kramer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Oikonomou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Procko et al., 2011</a>). Both <i>T02B11.3p::Ppa-obi-1:gfp(csuEx29)</i> and <i>F16F9.3p::Ppa-obi-1:gfp(csuEx30)</i> transgenic animals showed strong GFP expression in the amphid sheath cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) as well as phasmid sheath cells in the tail region (not shown). While the targeted misexpression of <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> did not alter the strong avoidance behavior towards either 2% or 10% ZTDO, <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> expression in <i>C. elegans</i> did reduce the paralytic effects of ZTDO (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Because wild-type <i>C. elegans</i> N2 is not susceptible to ZTDO-induced paralysis at 0.5% ZTDO that <i>P. pacificus</i> is, we increased the stringency of the assay by using 10% ZTDO, incubating for 16 hr, and exposing the animals in the absence of OP50 food. Under this enhanced ZTDO paralysis assay, we found that <i>F16F9.3p::Ppa-obi-1:gfp(csuEx30)</i> transgenic L4 larvae but not <i>T02B11.3p::Ppa-obi-1:gfp(csuEx29)</i> exhibited a small but statistically significant increase in protection from ZTDO-induced paralysis compared to wild-type N2 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). Because we could not detect apparent differences in GFP expression patterns between the two amphid promoters, the ability of <i>F16F9.3p::Ppa-obi-1:gfp</i> to reduce ZTDO paralysis may be due to subtle transient expression differences. These results suggest that while the expression of the <i>Ppa-</i>OBI-1 protein in the <i>C. elegans</i> amphid sheath cells is not sufficient to reduce avoidance to ZTDO, it can contribute to the <i>obi-1</i>-dependent protection from ZTDO-induced paralysis."

We have identified an important and likely co-evolving trait in the interaction between <i>P. pacifcus</i> nematodes and its beetle hosts. Although not symbiotic, necromenic associations between nematodes and insects have been considered commensalistic or mutualistic, but our results suggest antagonistic interactions between the larval stages of <i>P. pacificus</i> and the adult oriental beetle hosts that produce the ZTDO sex pheromone. Attraction and resistance to ZTDO in adult <i>P. pacificus</i> further points to a refined attenuated antagonism in their co-evolutionary relationship (<a href=\"#bib45\">Thompson, 2005</a>). Our data support the model that <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 is required to protect <i>P. pacificus</i> larvae against a host beetle pheromone ZTDO as well as to enable <i>P. pacificus</i> attraction to ZTDO. Furthermore, two different geographical isolates and developmental stages have varied responses to the oriental beetle pheromone. ZTDO may be a species-specific volatile synomone that acts through a lipid-binding protein to moderate nematode infection by arresting embryonic development, inducing larval paralysis, and inhibiting dauer exit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genetically defined reception to a species-specific compound mediating the interaction between a nematode and its insect host."

Our working model on <i>Ppa-</i>OBI-1 functions in the J4 larvae hypothesizes that <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 proteins in the extracellular space, such as the lumen of the amphid sheath cell, may be required to remove ZTDO bound to odor receptors on neurons.

                                "text": "Given the growing evidence that the amphid sheath cells in <i>C. elegans</i> are critical for proper neuronal development and function of the 12 pairs of chemosensory amphid neurons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shaham, 2006</a>), we propose the following models on how the <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 protein can act in the sheath cells to directly or indirectly modulate ZTDO chemosensation. In <i>C. elegans</i>, many proteins have enriched expression in the amphid sheath, such as DAF-6 and the secreted venom allergen-like VAP-1, and these secretions are corroborated by dense populations of vesicles in amphid sheath cells under electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bacaj et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Doroquez et al., 2014</a>). However, it is not yet known which amphid proteins, if any, are required in processing odors using behavioral assays. Interestingly, DAF-6 is a Patched-related protein with expression pattern that overlaps with <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> expression (amphid lumen, excretory canal, vulva lumen) and is required for chemotaxis and dauer formation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Perens and Shaham, 2005</a>). Similarly, <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> expression in the putative sheath or socket cells of the inner labial neurons may also be involved in ZTDO sensing, as recent ultrastructural electron micrograph reconstructions indicate that BAG (gas sensing) and FLP (nociceptive) neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> associate closely with the socket cells of the inner labial sensillae (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doroquez et al., 2014</a>). One possible mode of action for ZTDO may be its ability to change cell membrane permeability, thereby indirectly affecting the functions of the glia-associated neurons. Hence, <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 may function to counter the cell membrane permeability changes brought about by ZTDO by interacting with cell membrane lipids. Alternatively, <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 could mediate pheromone binding directly. In lepidopterans such as the wild silk moth <i>Antheraea polyphemus</i> and the cotton leafworm <i>Spodoptera littoralis</i>, pheromone-degrading and odorant-degrading enzymes (PDEs and ODEs) are esterases specifically expressed in the male antennal sensillar lymph analogous to the amphid lumen (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ishida and Leal, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Durand et al., 2011</a>). The termination of the signal by removing odors that have already triggered a response is an important process for preventing odor adaptation and increasing odor sensitivity. Thus, it is possible that <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 acts as a solubilizing factor for the lipid pheromones in the excretion-filled amphid sheath lumen (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The weak ability of amphid sheath-specific expression of <i>Ppa</i>-OBI-1 to confer ZTDO protection in <i>C. elegans</i> suggests that both expression pattern and protein function could be important factors in ZTDO sensing in <i>P. pacificus</i>. Future work will be necessary to determine if <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> expression restricted to the amphid sheath is sufficient to rescue the ZTDO attraction defect in <i>P. pacificus</i> and if the amphid sheath cells are required to mediate ZTDO sensing."

However in <i>P. pacificus</i> embryos, the susceptibility of ZTDO may be due to ZTDO limiting gas or ion exchange with the environment rather than direct interaction between ZTDO and cellular components, given that nematode egg shells are considered to have very limited permeability accessible only to small molecular weight solutes and gas molecules (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chitwood and Chitwood, 1974</a>). Since ZTDO exposure does not lead to embryonic arrest and paralysis in <i>C. elegans</i>, ZTDO must also interact with other non-conserved <i>P. pacificus</i>-specific molecules that have yet to be identified. There are very few known nematocides from natural compounds. One rare example comes from the oyster mushroom <i>Pleurotus ostreatus,</i> which secretes droplets that can immobilize rhabditid nematodes in an hour, though its effects on embryos have not been investigated (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barron and Thorn, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Stadler et al., 1994</a>). Future work on the different susceptibility to ZTDO may help to answer if there is a wider pattern of negative correlation between ZTDO attraction and ZTDO-induced paralysis in other natural isolates, as observed in the California and Washington strains. Such antagonistic traits may reveal possible co-evolution between host finding and host tolerance in necromenic associations."

                                "text": "We further speculate that in the natural ecology of <i>P. pacificus,</i> ZTDO may enable the beetle host to limit the nematode number and to thus synchronize the developmental stage of infective <i>P. pacificus</i> by arresting embryogenesis and lethally paralyzing J2 larvae. The unexpected role of a <i>P. pacificus</i> attractant to act as a developmental regulator against the younger larval stages, particularly the dauer larvae (DL), suggests that the ZTDO-resistant adult stage is a potential dispersal stage. This attenuated antagonistic interaction also revealed that nematode larvae and adults may be susceptible to distinct selective pressures. <i>P. pacificus</i> DL does not disperse readily, likely due to the secretion of the wax ester nematoil that enables <i>P. pacificus</i> to form dauer towers when potential hosts are nearby (<a href=\"#bib37\">Penkov et al., 2014</a>). Therefore under natural conditions, lower concentrations of ZTDO than the concentrations we have tested may serve as a close-range host dwelling strategy by inhibiting DL dispersal to form dauer aggregates. The developmental role of ZTDO may be part of a mechanism to limit nematode dispersal until the beetles mature. In these respects, the promotion of a non-DL dispersal stage and inhibition of DL dispersal by ZTDO resemble other known host-derived compounds found in the entomophilic nematode <i>B. xylophilus</i> and the phoretic nematode <i>C. japonica</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Okumura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). Attraction and paralysis by ZTDO may have co-evolved in the necromenic association to allow successive populations of founder <i>P. pacificus</i> DL and adults to infect beetles, culminating in arrested DL remaining on sexually mature beetles during the dispersal cycle. The pheromone arrested DL state may also help to account the observation that <i>Pristionchus</i> nematodes emerge several days later than rhabditids from the same species of host beetles. Our findings that a lipid-binding protein has a role in coordinating chemosensation, body proportions, and protection from a host pheromone encourages fresh inquiries on additional genes involved in ZTDO sensory signaling and its mechanism of action."

In brief, we used a Leica DM6000 and LAS application to measure body dimensions at 24-hr intervals starting at mid-J4/L4 stage. To determine hatching rate, we picked single J4-stage PS312 hermaphrodites onto fresh OP50 plates and transferred the nematodes every 24 hr three times at 20\u00b0C. The total number of eggs present on the plates following each transfer and the resulting number of 3-day old animals for each worm during the 3-day period were used to calculate the percentage of hatching and brood size."

In vitro synthesis of dsRNA from 1 \u03bcg of T7 amplified PCR template from the RNAi vector or the pL4440 negative control was accomplished using the Ambion in vitro synthesis kit (Grand Island, NY). RNAi by bacterial feeding of <i>C06G1.1</i> was performed by scoring the progeny of L4 stage <i>rrf-3(pk1426)</i> animals raised on RNAi or L4440 control plates containing 1 mM IPTG and 50 \u03bcg/ml carbenicillin."

In a genetic screen they identify a novel gene obi-1 which provides a molecular mechanism for the attraction and sensitivity to the beetle sex pheromone. The role of ZTDO as a developmental regulator are unexpected and exciting and shed new light on the evolution of nematode-insect associations. The data are clearly presented."
