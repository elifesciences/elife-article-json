Previously, we reported that the TATA-binding protein associated factor 7L (TAF7L) is an important regulator of white adipose tissue (WAT) differentiation. In this study, we show that TAF7L also serves as a molecular switch between brown fat and muscle lineages in vivo and in vitro. In adipose tissue, TAF7L-containing TFIID complexes associate with PPAR\u03b3 to mediate DNA looping between distal enhancers and core promoter elements. Our findings suggest that the presence of the tissue-specific TAF7L subunit in TFIID functions to promote long-range chromatin interactions during BAT lineage specification."

Previously, we reported that the TATA-binding protein associated factor 7L (TAF7L) is an important regulator of white adipose tissue (WAT) differentiation. In this study, we show that TAF7L also serves as a molecular switch between brown fat and muscle lineages in vivo and in vitro. In adipose tissue, TAF7L-containing TFIID complexes associate with PPAR\u03b3 to mediate DNA looping between distal enhancers and core promoter elements. Our findings suggest that the presence of the tissue-specific TAF7L subunit in TFIID functions to promote long-range chromatin interactions during BAT lineage specification."

In adults, higher levels of brown fat are associated with lower levels of fat overall, so there is considerable interest in learning more about this form of fat to help address rising levels of obesity in the world."

These findings inspired heightened efforts to better understand the formation of BAT during mammalian development. Previously, we showed that TAF7L, an orphan TBP-associated factor cooperates with PPAR\u03b3 in directing WAT gene regulation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Zhou et al., 2013a</a>). Given the central role of PPAR\u03b3 in both WAT and BAT development (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Kajimura et al., 2010</a>), we wondered whether TAF7L might also serve as a co-activator regulating the formation of BAT."

In particular, BAT-selective genes such as <i>Ucp1</i>, <i>Pgc1\u03b1</i>, <i>Cidea</i>, and <i>Scd1</i> involved in brown fat differentiation, thermogenesis, and mitochondrial function became significantly down-regulated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Harms and Seale, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ohno et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with the observed enhanced skeletal muscle morphological phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), we observed a concomitant up-regulation of skeletal muscle genes including <i>Myh1-8</i>, <i>Myf5</i>, and <i>Pax3</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abe et al., 2013</a>). Loss of TAF7L also led to activation of select genes in the formation of cartilage and bone development, but the majority of up-regulated genes appear to be involved in skeletal muscle development and function. We speculate that because BAT and muscle share common MYF5<sup><i>+</i></sup> dermotomal precursors (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kajimura et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Seale and Lazar, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Seale et al., 2011</a>), this relationship might favor the switch from BAT to skeletal muscle as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>.

We first depleted TAF7L levels in C3H10T1/2 cells by RNA interference using previously described shTAF7L and control shGFP constructs followed by induction of BAT differentiation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Zhou et al., 2013a</a>). As expected, we observed efficient formation of round fat cells peaking at day 2 post-induction in C3H10T1/2 cells treated with shGFP controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). By contrast, TAF7L-depleted C3H10T1/2 cells formed elongated muscle-like cells rather than round fat laden adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). mRNA analysis of post-induction cells (day2) revealed that specific muscle markers (<i>Myf5</i>, <i>Myod1</i>, and <i>Mef2c</i>) become activated in cells treated with shTAF7L, in some cases reaching up to \u223c30% of their expression level in myotubes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). At the same time, protein (PPAR\u03b3 and UCP1) and mRNA (<i>Pgc1\u03b1</i>, <i>Ucp1</i>, and <i>Cidea</i>) levels of brown adipocyte markers become significantly reduced 5 days post-induction, suggesting an efficient blockade of brown fat differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). We confirmed these results using primary WT and <i>Taf7l</i> KO brown adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Instead of treating C2C12 cells with the normal muscle-inducing protocol, we applied the brown fat differentiation regime to either control C2C12 cells (C2C12.CNTL) or myoblasts ectopically expressing TAF7L (C2C12.TAF7L) and found that only C2C12.TAF7L cells form multilocular brown fat cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Zhou et al., 2013a</a>). RNA analysis showed that TAF7L in C2C12 cells represses the expression of myoblast genes <i>Myf5</i> and <i>Myod</i>1 while significantly increasing the expression of brown fat-selective genes (<i>Ucp1, Cidea, Pgc1\u03b1,</i> and <i>Ppar\u03b1)</i> post-differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that TAF7L can drive myoblasts toward the brown fat lineage (<a href=\"#bib17\">Seale et al., 2008</a>).

Here, we wanted to confirm this interaction in C3H10T1/2 cells upon brown fat induction. By using sequential immunoprecipitations of doubly tagged TAF7L (FLAG&amp;V5;), followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and western blotting, we found that TAF7L pulls down a subset of TAFs normally associated with the prototypical TFIID complex. Although this coIPed complex contained a number of canonical TFIID TAF subunits, we nevertheless suspect that it may represent a fat-specific and structurally distinct complex (Fat-TFIID) because it behaved in a manner distinct from canonical TFIID by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). These immunoprecipitation assays also revealed that PPAR\u03b3 co-purifies with TAF7L in the Fat-TFIID complex from differentiated C3H10T1/2 cells but not from control FLAG-V5-GFP cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) nor with canonical TFIID lacking TAF7L (data not shown). Although we failed to detect PRDM16 in these affinity purification experiments, we did find that ectopically expressed TAF7L and PRDM16 associate with each other in 293T cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These data suggest that TAF7L-containing Fat-TFIID has gained the ability to bind endogenous PPAR\u03b3, which we speculate might facilitate its association with distinct cofactors such as PRDM16 in BAT or TLE3 in WAT to differentially regulate brown and white adipocyte formation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Villanueva et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2013</a>)."

Here, we have re-analyzed the binding site data for TAF7L, TBP, and PPAR\u03b3 focusing on loci of activated BAT-selective genes (<i>Cidea</i>, <i>Prdm16</i>, and <i>Ucp1)</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In contrast, TBP only binds at the core promoters of these genes.

We do not fully understand the molecular mechanisms driving the enhanced formation of skeletal muscle upon loss of TAF7L, but we speculate that TAF7L depletion decreases the transcription of BAT-selective genes, which might indirectly de-repress muscle-selective genes thereby switching precursor cells toward a skeletal muscle lineage. Moreover, the presence of TAF7L potentiates the efficient participation of a specialized Fat-TFIID complex in long-range chromatin interactions. Such a DNA looping mechanism is likely mediated through association with the fat-specific transcription factor PPAR\u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These new findings and our previous studies support the notion that TAF7L functions as a common cofactor regulator required for both WAT and BAT development."

Each data point in WT and <i>Taf7l</i> KO BAT was normalized by the BAC control template and presented as interaction frequency."

The work presented in this paper suggests an important role for a new molecular player, TAF7L.

Since PPARg is required for white and brown adipocyte development, it is not evident how this interaction specifically modulates brown adipogenesis. To address this point, the authors performed ChIP-Seq and found that TAF7L and PPARg co-occupy overlapping regions of PRDM16 and Ucp1 in post-differentiated cells. To clarify this line of investigation, the authors should address the following questions."

This finding argues for a broader role of TAF7L in adipogenesis (or perhaps even more broadly in development). As highlighted in point 1, the authors should address how TAF7L is specifically involved in brown fat development. In other words, the role of TAF7L in the browning of WAT should be addressed.</i>"

However, we believe a thorough and rigorous test of this hypothesis is well beyond the scope of this current study. We are particularly concerned that fully dissecting the browning of WAT will require a careful analysis of beige cells which are likely not the same as canonical BAT."
