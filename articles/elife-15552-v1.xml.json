It is composed of glucose polymers that form massive semi-crystalline granules. Its precise structure and composition determine its functionality and thus applications; however, there is no versatile model system allowing the relationships between the biosynthetic apparatus, glucan structure and properties to be explored. Here, we expressed the core Arabidopsis starch-biosynthesis pathway in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> purged of its endogenous glycogen-metabolic enzymes. Systematic variation of the set of biosynthetic enzymes illustrated how each affects glucan structure and solubility. Expression of the complete set resulted in dense, insoluble granules with a starch-like semi-crystalline organization, demonstrating that this system indeed simulates starch biosynthesis. Thus, the yeast system has the potential to accelerate starch research and help create a holistic understanding of starch granule biosynthesis, providing a basis for the targeted biotechnological improvement of crops."

It is composed of glucose polymers that form massive semi-crystalline granules. Its precise structure and composition determine its functionality and thus applications; however, there is no versatile model system allowing the relationships between the biosynthetic apparatus, glucan structure and properties to be explored. Here, we expressed the core Arabidopsis starch-biosynthesis pathway in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> purged of its endogenous glycogen-metabolic enzymes. Systematic variation of the set of biosynthetic enzymes illustrated how each affects glucan structure and solubility. Expression of the complete set resulted in dense, insoluble granules with a starch-like semi-crystalline organization, demonstrating that this system indeed simulates starch biosynthesis. Thus, the yeast system has the potential to accelerate starch research and help create a holistic understanding of starch granule biosynthesis, providing a basis for the targeted biotechnological improvement of crops."

Starch is also the main carbohydrate in our diet and its unusual physical properties mean that it has many industrial uses. It is made of two different sugar-based molecules known as glucans and forms large, partially crystalline granules inside plant cells. Several enzymes are known to be involved in making starch, yet it is not clear exactly how the process works."

Starch is comprised of two \u03b1-polyglucan components (here named glucans): large moderately-branched amylopectin molecules and interspersing small, near-linear amylose molecules (<a href=\"#bib58\">Manners, 1989</a>). Both are built from chains of \u03b1-1,4 linked glucose units that are connected via \u03b1-1,6-linkages (branch points). In amylopectin, the major and essential component, the branching pattern is non-random, giving rise to clusters of unbranched chain segments (<a href=\"#bib76\">P\u00e9rez and Bertoft, 2010</a>). Neighboring chains within these clusters form double helices that pack with distinct inter-helical spacing. The resulting crystalline lamellae, alternating with amorphous lamellae containing the branch points, stack with a periodicity of\u00a0~9\u201310.5 nm (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jenkins et al., 1993</a>).

However, to date, this variation cannot fully meet industrial needs, necessitating costly physicochemical modifications post-extraction to yield the desired properties (<a href=\"#bib101\">Tharanathan, 2005</a>). Although the starch-biosynthetic enzymes are highly conserved, we still do not have sufficient knowledge required for the rational modification of starch structure and properties in crops. This deficiency has several roots; first, the difficulty in generating plant mutants hinders a systematic analysis in most species. Second, the results obtained from comparable mutants in different plant systems are not always identical (e.g. due to variation in genetic, environmental and/or developmental backgrounds). Third, enzyme kinetics obtained from soluble substrates in vitro may not be representative of how an enzyme acts on a crystallizing surface in vivo (<a href=\"#bib70\">O'Neill and Field, 2015</a>). These problems are further compounded by the fact that the glucans that make up starch are polydisperse, necessitating multiple biochemical and biophysical techniques for their structural characterization. Collectively, these limitations impair our ability to define enzyme functions unambiguously and to derive an overall model of starch biosynthesis. As a result, progress in engineering new starches with enhanced functionalities <i>in planta</i> has been empirical and slow, and the full potential of this important renewable resource has not been realized."

Using a suite of molecular and biochemical analyses, we show that the enzymes are functional and, in the right combinations, capable of producing semi-crystalline starch-like granules. This shows that our yeast system is a highly tractable experimental system in which starch biosynthesis can be simulated and the capacities of different interdependent enzymatic combinations can be evaluated, bringing us much closer to a holistic view of this critical process."

To eliminate interfering effects from the yeast\u2019s endogenous glycogen metabolic pathway, we purged it of the five genes involved in glycogen biosynthesis (two glycogenins, two glycogen synthases and glycogen branching enzyme) and two involved in glycogen degradation (glycogen debranching enzyme and \u03b1-glucan phosphorylase; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We simultaneously introduced all known amylopectin-biosynthetic genes from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> via stable integration of coding sequences driven by galactose-inducible promoters. These are the starch synthases <i>SS1</i> (AGI locus code At5g24300)<i>, SS2</i> (At3g01180)<i>, SS3</i> (At1g11720) and <i>SS4</i> (At4g18240), the branching enzymes <i>BE2</i> (At5g03650) and <i>BE3</i> (At2g36390) and the isoamylase encoded by <i>ISA1</i> (At2g39930) and <i>ISA2</i> (At1g03310) (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for details on constructs).

Arabidopsis was chosen as the donor for amylopectin-biosynthetic genes because it has been intensively used for starch research, resulting in well-characterized mutants that enable us to make direct comparisons between yeast- and plant-derived glucans. In addition, we introduced a non-regulated form of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase from <i>Escherichia coli</i> (GlgC-TM; <a href=\"#bib84\">Sakulsingharoj et al., 2004</a>), as yeast glycogen biosynthesis is UDPglucose dependent, while the plant starch biosynthesis is ADPglucose dependent."

Either plant BE2 or BE3 enabled substantial glucan production in yeast cells lacking their endogenous BE (strains X and Y; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This was, however, not the case for strains expressing BE1. Here, only low amounts of amylose-like glucans could be detected (strains V and W), comparable to the strain lacking any branching enzyme (strain U; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This suggests that BE1 in fact is not a starch branching enzyme. Since the presence of BE1 also did not alter the glucans made by the other amylopectin biosynthetic enzymes, it was excluded from subsequent strain sets (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a> and associated text). In contrast, every plant SS produced glucans when expressed as the sole synthase activity (lines 0, 2, 4 and 6; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Expression of ISA in wild-type yeast suppressed the accumulation of glycogen (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This result was consistent with that observed when expressing ISA in <i>E. coli</i>, where it also reduced glycogen accumulation (<a href=\"#bib95\">Sundberg et al., 2013</a>). Branch-point hydrolysis by ISA may have a degrading effect when it is provided with glycogen as a substrate rather than an amylopectin \u2018precursor\u2019. The latter presumably crystallizes upon debranching, rendering it inaccessible to further modification (<a href=\"#bib95\">Sundberg et al., 2013</a>)."

Again, these alterations were consistent with previous data of <i>ss2</i> mutants from Arabidopsis and other species (<a href=\"#bib118\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Edwards et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Craig et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Morell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib116\">Zhang et al., 2004</a>).

A major obstacle associated with any plant-related approach is the presence of additional starch-active enzymes, some of which may not even be known. In Arabidopsis chloroplasts, where starch is made and degraded during a single diurnal cycle, there is a plethora of starch-catabolising enzymes: the two additional debranching enzymes ISA3 (At4g09020) and limit-dextrinase (At5g04360), at least two active \u03b2-amylases (BAM1 [At3g23920] and BAM3 [At4g17090]), the \u03b1-amylase AMY3 (At1g69830), the disproportionating enzyme DPE1 (At5g64860) and the \u03b1-glucan phosphorylase PHS1 (At3g29320) (<a href=\"#bib113\">Zeeman et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib110\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Delatte et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fulton et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Seung et al., 2013</a>). In general, starch synthesis and degradation are regarded as separate processes in wild-type plants. It is possible that the rapid crystallization of correctly synthesized amylopectin protects it from further modification by enzymes of starch degradation. However, in Arabidopsis mutants deficient in multiple starch-biosynthetic enzymes, glucan synthesis and accumulation have been repeatedly shown to be influenced by degrading enzymes, for example in the <i>isa1isa2</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Delatte et al., 2005</a>), the <i>be2be3</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dumez et al., 2006</a>), the <i>isa1isa2isa3lda</i> (<a href=\"#bib94\">Streb et al., 2008</a>-), the <i>ss2ss3</i> (<a href=\"#bib73\">Pfister et al., 2014</a>) and the <i>ss3ss4</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib89\">Seung et al., 2016</a>).

BE2 and BE3 are closely related class II BEs and largely redundant in Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dumez et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, the impact of having only BE3 is probably due to overall branching activity rather than to a difference in specificity. It is striking that in combination with some, but not all SS this low BE activity resulted in formation of insoluble glucans. This was despite the fact that in all cases the \u03bb<sub>max</sub> of the iodine-stained glucans increased, suggesting that the structure was altered in a similar way, i.e. more chains long enough to form single or double helices were present. Clearly, such secondary structures are not sufficient for insoluble glucan formation, presumably because they need also to align in parallel to form a semi-crystalline matrix. Further investigations of the insoluble glucans made by different strains in our yeast collection will deepen our understanding of the structural features that allow crystallization."

This phenotype is reminiscent of the yeast glycogenin mutant (<i>glg1glg2</i>) which synthesizes only little glycogen overall but accumulates it in single colonies, presumably due to stochastic initiation events (<a href=\"#bib104\">Torija et al., 2005</a>). This suggests that, similar to yeast glycogen synthases, SS1 has limited capacity to initiate glucan synthesis, but can use primers provided by glycogenins.

We first reasoned that SS1 and SS2 alone may generate a polymer that is excessively debranched by ISA, possibly because the glucan fails to become crystallization-competent upon debranching and hence remains accessible to further ISA action. However, the absence of malto-oligosaccharides - the expected products of ISA action - in these lines (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) argues against such a scenario. Rather, the degradation may happen at a very early time point and could impair the glucan synthesis altogether by limiting the availability of primers. This observation is particularly interesting since Arabidopsis <i>ss3ss4</i> mutants are virtually glucan-free due to an apparent failure in the priming of glucan synthesis (<a href=\"#bib97\">Szydlowski et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, it was recently shown that the additional knock-out of the \u03b1-amylase AMY3 in <i>ss4</i> Arabidopsis mutants increases granule number and overall starch content, and loss of AMY3 in <i>ss3ss4</i> Arabidopsis mutants (<i>amy3ss3ss4</i> mutants) even restored some granule formation (<a href=\"#bib89\">Seung et al., 2016</a>). These phenotypes were interpreted to mean that at least part of the priming function of SS4 lies in the protection of primers from premature degradation. Our observation that ISA may also diminish primers could explain why glucan accumulation in <i>amy3ss3ss4</i> mutants is only partially restored. Notably, ISA has been implicated as a negative regulator of granule initiation before, since the remaining starch of <i>isa</i> mutants is typically deposited as numerous small granules (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burton et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bustos et al., 2004</a>).

                                "text": "Another difference between the glucans made in yeast and in plant cells concerns the presence of soluble polysaccharides: while virtually all plant glucans are normally laid down as insoluble starch granules, every yeast strain accumulated also substantial amounts of soluble glucans. The percentages of insoluble glucans from total glucans varied depending on the complement of enzymes present (as discussed above). Still, it did not exceed\u00a0~70% in the best cases (strains O and N, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and ranged between 17 and 58% when ISA and both BEs were present (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This incomplete formation of insoluble glucans in yeast can have several reasons. First, it could again be a matter of enzyme balance, although we do not know of a comparable instance from plants here. Second, the efficient crystallization of glucans may require additional factors that we have not yet introduced into yeast. An interesting candidate is Early Starvation1 (or ESV1), a non-catalytic starch-binding protein whose absence causes altered granule morphology and starch turnover in Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Feike\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016</a>). ESV1 was proposed to facilitate the correct alignment of glucans within the granule matrix, which in turn could indirectly control the accessibility and thus degradation rate of glucans. However, its precise action remains unclear. Third, it is possible that soluble glucans that fail to crystallize efficiently are also synthesized in plant cells, but are rapidly removed by the starch-degrading enzymes described above. In yeast, such soluble glucans would accumulate as soluble glucans, since the degrading machinery is absent. Finally, it is also important to note that our definition of insoluble and soluble glucans in this context is based on the fractionation by centrifugation at 6000 <i>g</i> for 5 min. Insoluble glucans with a tiny particle size may remain in the supernatant after such a low-speed centrifugation. Indeed, preliminary experiments suggest that half of the glucans in the soluble fraction from line 29 sediments upon extending the centrifugation to 20 min (data not shown), indicating that at least part of it may actually be\u00a0insoluble."

Soluble glucans were first precipitated in methanol as described above, providing also the non-methanol precipitable glucans (malto-oligosaccharides or MOS). Arabidopsis leaf starch from wild-type (WS ecotype) and mutants was extracted using perchloric acid as described (<a href=\"#bib73\">Pfister et al., 2014</a>). Soluble and insoluble glucan fractions were solubilized by heating to 99\u00b0C for 15 min. Samples were then debranched for 2.5 hr at 37\u00b0C in a reaction containing 1 U <i>Klebsiella planticola</i> pullulanase (M1, Megazyme), 0.04\u00a0U of <i>Pseudomonas</i> isoamylase\u00a0(Megazyme) and 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8. The reaction was stopped by heating to 99\u00b0C for 5 min. The samples were clarified by centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 <i>g</i> and the supernatant applied to sequential 1.5 mL columns of Dowex 50WX4 (hydrogen form, 100\u2013200 mesh) and Dowex 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08 (chloride form, 200\u2013400 mesh). The glucans were eluted in 4 mL water, lyophilized and re-dissolved in water by heating to 99\u00b0C for 5 min. In addition, non-debranched controls of soluble and insoluble glucans from several yeast lines were prepared by omitting the debranching enzymes. Malto-oligosaccharides were treated in the same way as these non-debranched controls. Chains were separated on a HPAEC-PAD system (ICS-5000, Dionex) using a CarboPack PA-200 column, a flow rate of 0.5 mL min<sup>\u22121</sup> and the following program: 0 to 12.5 min, a linear gradient from 95% eluent A (100 mM NaOH) and 5% B (150 mM NaOH, 0.5 M sodium acetate) to 60% A and 40% B; 12.5 to 50 min, a linear gradient to 15% A and 85% B; 50 to 52 min, a linear gradient to 10% A and 90% B; 52 to 60 min, 10% A and 90% B (column wash); 60 to 80 min, 95% A and 5% B (column equilibration) (all eluent percentages are given as volume per volume). Peaks were identified using standard linear glucan chains with degrees of polymerization (DP) from 2 to 7 (maltose to maltoheptaose). Peak areas were determined with Chromeleon software and summed within the depicted range (DP 3 to 60 in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, and DP from 3 to 45 for the comparisons in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). Non-debranched controls of soluble and insoluble glucans gave negligible peaks. CLDs from plant glucans in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u00a0and C</a> were recalculated from <a href=\"#bib73\">Pfister et al., (2014)</a>. In the differences plots, the final error was calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared S.E.M.s. Very rarely, a replicate sample was excluded if it showed signs of degradation (specified by a low overall peak area relative to other sample replicates or obvious degradation products)."

It l also has many non-food applications. Differences in starch structure between and within species are of great biological, nutritional and technical importance. Starch is also immensely complex, consisting of an unbranched glucan (amylose) and a branched glucan (amylopectin), which form a semi-crystalline starch granule. This physicochemical complexity sets starch apart from all other storage glucans, including the widely distributed soluble glycogen. Starch structure and the role of different enzymes in generating this structure have been intensively studied in several plant species including the referenced system Arabidopsis and also many crops including maize and potato. This has occurred out of curiosity, but also frequently driven by possible applications. The approach has mainly involved using forward or reverse genetics, followed by chemical and physical analysis of the resulting changes in starch structure. These studies have defined a set of enzymes that are involved in starch synthesis \u2013 or more precisely, whose modification / deletion alters the levels or especially the structure of starch. These genes are being used to try to modify starch structure in Arabidopsis and several crop plants."

In Arabidopsis, however, both BE2 and BE3 fall into class II, and there is no class I branching enzyme (Dumez et al., 2006). The gene annotated as BE1 belongs to the putative class III of branching enzymes (Han et al. 2007). However, no branching enzyme activity or role in starch metabolism has been reported for this or any other enzyme of the putative class. The <i>be1</i> mutant of Arabidopsis was first reported to have a wild-type phenotype (Dumez et al. 2006), while the <i>be2be3</i> double mutant was reported to have no starch synthesis (i.e. a BE null mutant). Later, the <i>be1</i> mutant was reported to be embryo lethal (Wang et al. 2010). We nevertheless agreed with the reviewers that it was interesting to test the function of BE1 in the yeast system. We therefore expressed it in two different backgrounds; 1) together with SS3 and the AGPase (strains V and W, new Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). This strain only contained amylose-like glucans like its parental line with just SS3 and the AGPase, indicating that BE1 alone has little or no branching activity. Second, we included BE1 in strain 29 (i.e. in addition to the other amylopectin-synthesizing enzymes). Here again, BE1 did not alter glucan production or structure (as judged by iodine staining, chain-length distribution, granule morphology, X-ray scattering patterns; new Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 and data not shown). Thus, the absence of BE1 cannot explain the atypical repeat structure in the insoluble glucans from strain 29. Rather we believe that the repeat size stems from an enzymatic imbalance; more specifically excessive synthase activity relative to branching activity \u2013 a hypothesis we state clearly in the Discussion of the revised manuscript (section \u201cCurrent limitations and future applications of the yeast system\u201d) and which we will test in future research."

For this we created an additional set of yeast strains expressing only BE3 (like in line I) instead of both BE2 and BE3 (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). These data show that SS3 is also capable of producing insoluble glucans in the absence of ISA, and that in both instances this is dependent on having only BE3 instead of both BE2 and BE3. Iodine staining of the glucans revealed a consistent shift towards higher \u03bb<sub>max</sub> values (wavelength of maximum absorption) when only BE3 is present. This indicates that more chains are able to form secondary structures, which presumably renders part of the glucans insoluble, despite the absence of ISA.
