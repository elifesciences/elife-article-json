Unraveling the regulatory mechanisms underlying adipogenesis is therefore highly relevant from a biomedical perspective. Our current understanding of fat cell differentiation is centered on the transcriptional cascades driven by the C/EBP protein family and the master regulator PPAR\u03b3. To elucidate further components of the adipogenic gene regulatory network, we performed a large-scale transcription factor (TF) screen overexpressing 734 TFs in mouse pre-adipocytes and probed their effect on differentiation. We identified 22 novel pro-adipogenic TFs and characterized the top ranking TF, ZEB1, as being essential for adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, its expression levels correlate with fat cell differentiation potential in humans. Genomic profiling further revealed that this TF directly targets and controls the expression of most early and late adipogenic regulators, identifying ZEB1 as a central transcriptional component of fat cell differentiation."

Unraveling the regulatory mechanisms underlying adipogenesis is therefore highly relevant from a biomedical perspective. Our current understanding of fat cell differentiation is centered on the transcriptional cascades driven by the C/EBP protein family and the master regulator PPAR\u03b3. To elucidate further components of the adipogenic gene regulatory network, we performed a large-scale transcription factor (TF) screen overexpressing 734 TFs in mouse pre-adipocytes and probed their effect on differentiation. We identified 22 novel pro-adipogenic TFs and characterized the top ranking TF, ZEB1, as being essential for adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, its expression levels correlate with fat cell differentiation potential in humans. Genomic profiling further revealed that this TF directly targets and controls the expression of most early and late adipogenic regulators, identifying ZEB1 as a central transcriptional component of fat cell differentiation."

Twenty-six transcription factors were found to increase the number of these primed cells that became mature fat cells\u2014most of which had not previously been shown to affect how fat cells develop. The most powerful driver of fat cell development was ZEB1: a transcription factor that has previously been implicated in many other biological processes.

The enrichment was strongest for genes in cluster 2, which were previously associated with mitosis and cell cycle functions. This is consistent with the pathway analysis results reported above and suggests that ZEB1 may control the expression of genes involved in coordinated cell cycle arrest, an essential step in 3T3-L1 differentiation (<a href=\"#bib74\">Tang et al., 2003</a>). Conversely, we found that a striking majority of genes whose expression increases upon confluence (day \u22122 expression lower than day 0 expression) were downregulated at day 0 upon ZEB1 KD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The strongest signal was observed for cluster 3 genes, which were previously associated with cell adhesion and extracellular matrix functionality.

In pre-adipocytes, positive regulators tended to be down-regulated upon ZEB1 KD while negative regulators were up-regulated (p = 0.007, Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing fold-changes), suggesting that ZEB1 acts primarily as a positive regulator in the context of the aGRN, consistent with observations from our phenotype-profiling experiments. We recently dissected the role of SMRT (NCOR2), a transcriptional co-repressor, in fat cell differentiation and showed how it maintains genes in a poised state until adipogenesis is induced (<a href=\"#bib55\">Raghav et al., 2012</a>). If ZEB1 is, as hypothesized, an activator of early adipogenic genes, which are partially repressed by SMRT, we expect (1) a high overlap between genes regulated by SMRT and ZEB1; and (2) SMRT and ZEB1 KD to have inverse effects on the expression of the genes that they control. Indeed, we found that the fold-changes induced in POLII binding upon SMRT KD and in gene expression upon ZEB1 KD were significantly negatively correlated (Spearman's \u03c1 = \u22120.36, p &lt; 10<sup>\u221216</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>).

Overall, we found that over 40% (compared to an expected 14%) of both the genes that lose SMRT binding upon fat cell differentiation and those that experience a POLII binding change upon SMRT KD are significantly (p &lt; 0.004 Fisher's exact test and permutation test) de-regulated upon ZEB1 KD (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>)."

We found that almost one third of ZEB1-bound regions were co-bound by C/EBP\u03b2, which represents a significant enrichment over random expectation (Fisher's exact test, p \u2264 10<sup>\u221212</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Both ZEB1 and C/EBP\u03b2 ChIP-seq signal intensities were high at these 5,032 genomic locations, which were also enriched for AP1 factor binding (in particular ATF7 and ATF2), high DNase I signal, and to a lesser extent POLII (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Strikingly, 27% of regions bound by ZEB1 at day 0 were also bound by at least one of the five AP1 complex proteins JUNB, FOSL2, CJUN, ATF7, and ATF2 4 hr after induction of differentiation, again a highly significant co-localization (Fisher's exact test, p \u2264 10\u201312) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>).

Indeed, genome-wide correlations between ZEB1 and POLII ChIP-seq read counts were high (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Finally, we also analyzed the overlap between ZEB1, AP1, and C/EBP\u03b2 in the human HepG2 as well as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (data from ENCODE [<a href=\"#bib18\">Gerstein et al., 2012</a>]). We observed consistent enrichment of C/EBP\u03b2, JUN, and FOSL (AP1 complex members) around ZEB1 peak summits (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>), providing support for a conserved molecular relationship between these TFs in mediating DNA binding."

We first verified that we could recover the ZEB1 protein as well as its known interaction partners such as CtBP1/2 and HDAC1/2 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gheldof et al., 2012</a>). The presence of these four known partners among the 89 stringently selected (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and reproducibly pulled down proteins confirmed the validity of our approach. Importantly, we also detected C/EBP\u03b2 at similar stringency and additionally, RUNX2, NFIX, and AP1-family members ATF2 and ATF7-specific peptides in one of the replicate experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). These data suggest that, in 3T3-L1 cells, ZEB1 is located within the same protein complex as at least one of the major regulators of adipogenic gene expression (C/EBP\u03b2) and potentially also cooperates with other adipogenic TFs such as ATF2 or ATF7 to mediate transcription."

We first validated these C/EBP\u03b2-bound regions by performing C/EBP\u03b2 ChIP-qPCR in our (control) 3T3-L1 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We found that C/EBP\u03b2 was almost invariably enriched at ZEB1-bound regions, even at regions (five out of six) that did not show C/EBP\u03b2 enrichment in the publicly available ChIP-seq data and that were thus presumed to be bound by ZEB1 only (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Thus, the genomic co-localization of the two proteins may be even more widespread than originally appreciated, strengthening their functional relationship. In stable C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown cells, we observed a decrease of both C/EBP\u03b2 and ZEB1 DNA binding at the majority of the tested regions with the exception of the single ZEB1-only bound region, suggesting that ZEB1 DNA-binding is dependent on C/EBP\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). However, when we measured <i>Zeb1</i> mRNA levels in the C/EBP\u03b2 KD cells, we observed a two-fold decrease compared to control (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). This result implies that C/EBP\u03b2 mediates <i>Zeb1</i> expression, which is substantiated by the fact that C/EBP\u03b2 directly targets the <i>Zeb1</i> gene in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Thus, at this point, we cannot exclude that the observed decrease in ZEB1 DNA binding in C/EBP\u03b2 KD cells may in part be a consequence of decreased cellular ZEB1 levels. Further experiments will be required to examine putative DNA binding cooperativity effects between these two TFs."

To further assess the functional impact of ZEB1 depletion on these late- vs. early-only bound genes, we integrated the expression data into our analyses (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The most notable observation was that a large fraction of late-only genes (here defined as genes that contain at least one late-only bound region but no early-only one) are down-regulated upon ZEB1 KD, with almost a quarter of them being significantly lower expressed at differentiation day 2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), corresponding to an almost three-fold enrichment compared to statically bound genes (p \u2264 10<sup>\u201312</sup>, Fisher's exact test).

Nevertheless, a subset of ZEB1 target sites is clearly dynamically bound. Genes that acquire ZEB1 binding after day 0 tend to be also bound by C/EBP\u03b2, up-regulated after differentiation induction, particularly sensitive to alternation of nuclear ZEB1 levels and overall enriched for adipogenic functions. This suggests that ZEB1 may be involved in mediating the regulatory switch in primed pre-adipocytes toward the terminal differentiation program."

To investigate this, we used subcutaneous fat biopsies from a previously sampled cohort of 62 obese patients (41 females and 21 males) with body mass indices (BMI) of 31\u201364 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Meissburger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Winkler et al., 2013</a>). Specifically, we determined <i>Zeb1</i> mRNA expression in the SVF from each patient's fat sample. We then correlated the resulting expression values to multiple adipose-relevant measures (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a> [<a href=\"#bib24\">Gubelmann et al., 2014</a>], \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), including the ex vivo differentiation potential of human SVF from subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib44\">Meissburger et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, we found strong positive correlations (Spearman's \u03c1 \u2265 0.40, p \u2264 0.03) with adipocyte differentiation, total fat mass, as well as adiponectin levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a> [<a href=\"#bib24\">Gubelmann et al., 2014</a>]).

Thus, <i>Zeb1</i> SVF expression levels appear indicative of differentiation potential, fat mass, and adiponectin levels in humans, consistent with the positive effect of ZEB1 on adipogenesis observed in mice.

This protein (also known as \u03b4EF1, TCF8, NIL2-a, BZP, AREB6, MEB1, ZFHX1a, and ZFHEP) is a highly conserved and versatile TF that was originally identified as a repressor of the lens-specific \u03b41-crystalline enhancer in chicken (<a href=\"#bib17\">Funahashi et al., 1991</a>). It has subsequently been shown to be involved in a broad range of regulatory processes, including EMT, tumor metastasis, development, and differentiation (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib19\">Gheldof et al., 2012</a>), providing a rationale as to why homozygous <i>Zeb1</i> null mice are not viable (<a href=\"#bib31\">Higashi et al., 1997</a>). Similar to the majority of the other TFs identified in our screen, little is known about the involvement of ZEB1 in fat cell differentiation. One report linked a ZEB1 gain-of-function mutation to increased adiposity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kurima et al., 2011</a>), consistent with our findings; another found that female mice that are heterozygous for a targeted deletion of exon 1 of <i>Zeb1</i> show increased adiposity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Saykally et al., 2009</a>), thus identifying ZEB1 as a repressor of adipogenesis. However, the latter study also reported that ZEB1 expression in parametrial fat increases as fat accumulates, in line with the results presented here. We therefore suspect that the phenotype observed in the studied ZEB1 haploinsufficient mice may not be related to adipocyte hyperplasia, but rather to hypertrophy, another well-established means of adipose tissue expansion. Thus, our findings consolidate and explain ZEB1's involvement in adipogenesis."

This is further supported by earlier observations revealing that <i>Zeb1</i> is expressed at high levels in adipose stem cells in vivo (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kupershmidt et al., 2010</a>), that it is significantly expressed higher in pre-adipocytes compared to adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kapushesky et al., 2012</a>), and that it is one of relatively few genes that is highly up-regulated during transition of mouse embryonic stem cells to adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Billon et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, we found that many of the newly identified TFs such as ZFP30, MSX1, and ATOH8 are also highly expressed in pre-adipocytes. In addition, they are all direct targets of ZEB1 and their expression is affected by ZEB1 KD, suggesting that they may also have a role in early adipogenesis. The identification of several, putatively novel early adipogenic regulators likely reflects the nature of our experimental set-up, which employs early induction of TF overexpression before the cells undergo terminal differentiation. The ability to detect such early regulators is valuable, because the uncharted gene regulatory territory is especially confined to early processes rather than late ones for adipogenesis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gupta et al., 2010</a>)."

In terms of sequence specificity, we found that ZEB1-bound regions were not only enriched for E-boxes (in particular \u2018CACCTG\u2019) as previously described, but also for a large number of DNA binding motifs of established adipogenic regulators, including C/EBP\u03b2, AP1, and NFI factors (<a href=\"#bib85\">Waki et al., 2011</a>).

These data suggest that ZEB1 may be involved in mediating the regulatory switch in primed pre-adipocytes toward the terminal differentiation program. Interestingly, a comparable mechanism has been uncovered in vascular smooth muscle cells, where ZEB1 has been shown to interact with SMAD3 and to synergistically activate the transcription of key differentiation genes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nishimura et al., 2006</a>). In the context of adipocytes, we propose that ZEB1 forms a complex with C/EBP\u03b2, as supported by our mass spectrometry data, and that these two TFs cooperate to control adipogenic gene expression. In contrast, we found that early-only bound regions were enriched for motifs of the osteogenic master regulator RUNX2, raising the possibility that ZEB1 may bind to osteogenic regulatory regions (likely in a repressive context), and may thus be involved in the bone-fat switch. This is consistent with ZEB1's previous implication in differentiation of various mesenchymal lineages, including osteogenesis, myogenesis, and chondrogenesis (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib19\">Gheldof et al., 2012</a>])."

Our study therefore breaks new ground with respect to investigating the functional significance of this association."

To overcome the doxycycline effect of a Tet-on inducible lentiviral vector, the TF ORFs were subcloned from the pDONR221 entry clones into the pLenti6/UbC/V5-DEST expression vector (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). As negative controls, the original vector and the shEMPTY (Sigma) were used. All experiments were performed in three replicates and the significance of the observed changes was estimated using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test."

Although the authors provide evidence that ZEB1 is required for terminal differentiation of MSCs (i.e. C3H10T1/2 cells), it is not clear if this is because ZEB1 is required for the commitment step. The analysis of expression of Zfp423 and Zfp521 upon ZEB1 knock down is not convincing in itself. If the authors want to claim that ZEB1 also regulates commitment, this should be more thoroughly evaluated experimentally. Note, the editor believes that this question is better suited for a future manuscript and strongly suggests that the authors simply soften their conclusions regarding a role in commitment in the present paper. Alternatively, if the authors wish to make this claim, additional studies would be required. Some of the questions that could be addressed include: (1) can over expression of ZEB1 substitute for BMP-2/4 signaling to commit C3H10T1/2 cells to the adipocyte lineage?; (2) does overexpression of ZEB1 decrease the potential of C3H10T1/2 cells to develop into other cell lineages?; (3) is transient overexpression or knock down during commitment enough to enhance or decrease, respectively, differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells?; or (4) is overexpression or knock down only during terminal differentiation of C3H10T1/2 enough to enhance or inhibit differentiation, respectively?"

We implemented this protocol because we were specifically interested in identifying transcription factors that enhance adipogenesis. If rosiglitazone had been used, then the margin to see this effect would have been very low since PPAR activators such as rosiglitazone yield close to complete differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (e.g. Chawla and Lazar, PNAS, 1994). With our protocol, the average differentiation of cells was close to 50%, leaving ample room for observing enhancing effects. To be completely clear, but considering the fact that the method has already been described several times in the literature (e.g. Meissburger et al.

We thus decided to validate our ZEB1 ChIP-seq data by performing a ChIP on HA-tagged ZEB1 in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells using a HA-specific antibody to provide the requested assessment of the specificity of the ZEB1 antibody. While overexpression may increase the number of binding events, we would expect the majority of endogenous ZEB1 binding sites to overlap with those detected using ZEB1-HA ChIP. Indeed, we found that ZEB1 replicate experiments versus ZEB1-HA before differentiation showed high correlation of read counts with Spearman\u2019s rho = 0.83 and 0.86, in the range of what is typically observed for replicate ChIP-seq experiments (see revised <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B-C</a>).

We therefore set out to analyze the binding behavior of ZEB1 in stable C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown 3T3-L1 cells (revised <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2A</a>). We selected 10 genomic regions bound by both C/EBP\u03b2 and ZEB1 as well as six regions bound by ZEB1 only, using publicly available C/EBP\u03b2 ChIP-seq data (Siersbaeck et al., EMBO J, 2011). First, we validated these regions by performing C/EBP\u03b2 ChIP-qPCR in control 3T3-L1 cells (revised <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>), allowing us to uncover that C/EBP\u03b2 binding is more prevalent than so far appreciated (<a href=\"#bib65\">Siersbaeck et al. 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib71\">Steger et al., 2010</a>) given that we found that most tested \u201cZEB1-only\u201d regions (five out of six) are nevertheless bound by C/EBP\u03b2. These results already strengthen the regulatory relationship between ZEB1 and C/EBP\u03b2. We then targeted nine regions that we experimentally determined were bound by both C/EBP\u03b2 and ZEB1 as well as the sole ZEB1-only bound region to determine the ZEB1 DNA binding enrichment at these regions in stable C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown versus control cells using ZEB1 ChIP-qPCR. We found that ZEB1 DNA binding is decreased to various degrees at all tested regions compared to control knockdown cells, whereas this was not observed at the control site bound by ZEB1 only (revised <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2C</a>). These results suggest that the binding behavior of ZEB1 is influenced by C/EBP\u03b2, although we cannot exclude at this point that the observed decrease in ZEB1 DNA binding in C/EBP\u03b2 knockdown cells may stem from a decrease in overall ZEB1 protein levels. Indeed, further analyses revealed that the knockdown of C/EBP\u03b2 in 3T3-L1 cells decreases ZEB1 gene expression, as assessed by qPCR (revised <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2D</a>). This result implies that C/EBP\u03b2 mediates <i>Zeb1</i> expression, which is substantiated by the fact that C/EBP\u03b2 appears to target the <i>Zeb1</i> gene in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (revised <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2E</a>). Thus, the decreased DNA binding of ZEB1 in C/EBP\u03b2-knockdown cells may also be a consequence of overall decreased ZEB1 levels (even though this was not reflected at the negative control site 10)."

The analysis of expression of Zfp423 and Zfp521 upon ZEB1 knock down is not convincing in itself. If the authors want to claim that ZEB1 also regulates commitment, this should be more thoroughly evaluated experimentally. Note, the editor believes that this question is better suited for a future manuscript and strongly suggests that the authors simply soften their conclusions regarding a role in commitment in the present paper. Alternatively, if the authors wish to make this claim, additional studies would be required. Some of the questions that could be addressed include: (1) can over expression of ZEB1 substitute for BMP-2/4 signaling to commit C3H10T1/2 cells to the adipocyte lineage?; (2) does overexpression of ZEB1 decrease the potential of C3H10T1/2 cells to develop into other cell lineages?; (3) is transient overexpression or knock down during commitment enough to enhance or decrease, respectively, differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells?; or (4) is overexpression or knock down only during terminal differentiation of C3H10T1/2 enough to enhance or inhibit differentiation, respectively?</i>"
