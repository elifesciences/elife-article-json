This concept remains controversial and lacks direct experimental support in intact cells. Here, we visualize ordered and disordered domains in mouse B lymphoma cell membranes using super-resolution fluorescence localization microscopy, demonstrate that clustered BCR resides within ordered phase-like domains capable of sorting key regulators of BCR activation, and present a minimal, predictive model where clustering receptors leads to their collective activation by stabilizing an extended ordered domain. These results provide evidence for the role of membrane domains in BCR signaling and a plausible mechanism of BCR activation via receptor clustering that could be generalized to other signaling pathways. Overall, these studies demonstrate that lipid mediated forces can bias biochemical networks in ways that broadly impact signal transduction."

This concept remains controversial and lacks direct experimental support in intact cells. Here, we visualize ordered and disordered domains in mouse B lymphoma cell membranes using super-resolution fluorescence localization microscopy, demonstrate that clustered BCR resides within ordered phase-like domains capable of sorting key regulators of BCR activation, and present a minimal, predictive model where clustering receptors leads to their collective activation by stabilizing an extended ordered domain. These results provide evidence for the role of membrane domains in BCR signaling and a plausible mechanism of BCR activation via receptor clustering that could be generalized to other signaling pathways. Overall, these studies demonstrate that lipid mediated forces can bias biochemical networks in ways that broadly impact signal transduction."

Often, signal transduction relies on the spatial organization of receptors as well as effector proteins that regulate down-stream signaling activity. In principle, spatial organization in biological membranes can be enforced through varied mechanisms including direct protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Douglass and Vale, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Su et al., 2016b</a>), dynamic or passive coupling to cytoskeletal elements (<a href=\"#bib85\">W\u00fclfing and Davis, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kaizuka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">DeMond et al., 2008</a>), adhesion (<a href=\"#bib18\">Davis and van der Merwe, 2006</a>), curvature mediated forces (<a href=\"#bib91\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aimon et al., 2014</a>), or steady state biochemical networks with spatial heterogeneity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chau et al., 2012</a>). It is also proposed that plasma membrane lipids contribute to the spatial organization of membrane proteins via the same thermodynamic forces that drive the separation of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases in model membranes (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schroeder et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</a>). Liquid-ordered like domains are often referred to as lipid rafts or lipid shells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson and Jacobson, 2002</a>), and are hypothesized to impact a broad array of signaling cascades that originate at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib68\">Simons and Toomre, 2000</a>) including B cell receptor signaling (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cheng et al., 1999</a>). However, the existence of phase-like membrane domains and their putative roles in signaling pathways remain controversial, largely because the majority of experimental support for this concept is indirect or relies on methodology with well characterized limitations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Heerklotz, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Munro, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kwik et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kenworthy, 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "Some of the strongest experimental evidence supporting a heterogeneous plasma membrane comes from F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements between membrane components. This method is sensitive to heterogeneity on length-scales smaller than the F\u00f6rster distance (~5 nm) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kenworthy and Edidin, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Varma and Mayor, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Pyenta et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Zacharias et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sharma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rao and Mayor, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sengupta et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Goswami et al., 2008</a>). While powerful for detecting interactions between proteins and/or lipids that occur on small length-scales, the FRET signal is highly nonlinear with respect to probe separation distance and depends on both donor/acceptor ratio and probe absolute density, which typically vary in experiments. These complications can lead to weak sensitivity of FRET measurements to changes in local concentration and often modeling is required to interpret experimental findings quantitatively (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kenworthy and Edidin, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rao and Mayor, 2005</a>). Here, we apply super-resolution fluorescence localization imaging to complement these past approaches to directly visualize ordered and disordered-like domains in intact cell plasma membranes. This approach allows us to characterize and quantify, in a model-independent manner, the spatial organization of membrane components on length scales between those accessible by FRET-based techniques and conventional optical microscopy."

                        "text": "B cells undergo a signaling response when their B cell receptors (BCRs) are engaged by antigen, either in the form of solution-phase multivalent antigen (<a href=\"#bib52\">Minguet et al., 2010</a>) or surface-presented monovalent antigen (<a href=\"#bib5\">Batista et al., 2001</a>), however the molecular mechanisms driving BCR signal initiation are still controversial (<a href=\"#bib57\">Packard and Cambier, 2013</a>). Notably, simply clustering the BCR with antibodies directed against the receptor initiates phosphorylation by Src family kinases, resulting in the binding of downstream kinases and effectors that amplify and propagate the signaling response (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cambier and Ransom, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Campbell and Sefton, 1990</a>). This supports the idea that, at least in some contexts, the spatial organization of the BCR can function to communicate antigen binding, similar to other transmembrane receptors (<a href=\"#bib51\">Metzger, 1992</a>), as opposed to a mechanism where receptor binding is conveyed solely through ligand-induced conformational changes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Campbell and Humphries, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sounier et al., 2015</a>). Several mechanistic models have been put forth to explain how BCR clustering could give rise to receptor activation. In one model, BCR clustering initiates signaling via protein-protein interactions between neighboring receptors, such as the transphosphorylation of nearby receptors by receptor-bound kinases (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sotirellis et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kurosaki and Kurosaki, 1997</a>). A second model proposes that antigen binding acts to separate pre-clustered BCR, exposing binding sites to kinases that propagate activation (<a href=\"#bib86\">Yang and Reth, 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib87\">2010b</a>). A third model, which is the focus of investigation here, postulates that clustering BCR acts to stabilize an ordered membrane domain that impacts the receptor-proximal distribution of regulatory proteins involved in initiating or modulating the resulting cellular response. Specifically, ordered membrane domains are predicted to support interactions with activating kinases and suppress interactions with deactivating phosphatases. This hypothesis has been strengthened by experimental support (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pierce, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sohn et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gupta and DeFranco, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sohn et al., 2008a</a>), and among this evidence are observations of changes in FRET upon receptor clustering and activation between BCR and a marker of ordered membrane domains, but not between BCR and a marker of disordered domains (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sohn et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">2008b</a>). These studies demonstrated that receptor clustering leads to a transient increase in near-neighbor interactions (within a few lipid diameters) between BCR and order-preferring lipid probes and suggested that these interactions are important for the initiation of BCR activation by the Src family kinase Lyn. Currently, the role of membrane domains in BCR signaling remains a topic of active investigation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pierce and Liu, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Horejsi and Hrdinka, 2014</a>) as the field works to put together a more holistic picture of how interactions between proteins and lipids could support signaling function."

Using this approach, we directly visualize ordered domains co-localized with clustered BCR. We find that these domains sort key regulatory proteins involved in BCR signaling and provide a local environment that favors tyrosine phosphorylation. We also present a predictive model whereby BCR clustering leads to its phosphorylation through the stabilization of an ordered membrane domain. Our findings suggest that the collective protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions responsible for the stabilization of an ordered domain around BCR clusters give rise to emergent signaling function by influencing the local biochemical\u00a0environment of BCRs within clusters. These measurements detail the molecular redistribution of membrane components around embedded membrane protein clusters, utilizing super-resolution microscopy to gain access to length scales that are smaller than those accessible by conventional microscopy and larger than length scales accessible by FRET. Overall, our imaging studies provide additional direct evidence that clustered BCR associates with a local environment enriched in ordered lipids. Together with our simulation and functional data, this evidence supports a mechanism for clustering-induced activation of BCR that involves lipid-mediated sorting of regulatory proteins. Similar mechanisms may be relevant to other pathways where changes in receptor organization lead to signaling functions."

(<b>a, c</b>) Magenta points represent ordered domain preferring proteins that are either allowed to explore all space (<b>a</b>) or are forced to reside within a circular domain (<b>c</b>). Green pixels in the fully sampled images (top panels of a and c) represent disordered components and black pixels represent ordered components. In the under-sampled images, green points are a subset of the green pixels shown in the fully sampled images, at a density of roughly 400/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> (100 points per 512 by 512 nm box). The left-most images in a and c represent simulation snapshots without additional processing. The remaining images are generated from the same information present in the left-most image, but both colors are filtered (blurred) by a 2D Gaussian function with standard deviation (\u03c3) of 30 nm (second column) or 220 nm (third column) to simulate the finite localization precision of super-resolution microscopy or traditional resolution of diffraction-limited microscopy, respectively. Scale-bars are 100 nm. (<b>b, d</b>) Cross-correlations C(r) between magenta proteins and green disordered components were tabulated from 100 images similar to those shown in panels of a and c. Solid lines represent C(r) tabulated from fully sampled images (top panels of <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>) and points with error bounds represent C(r) tabulated from under-sampled images (bottom panels of <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>). Without blurring, it is clearly evident that green components are depleted from the local area around proteins (C(r)\u00a0&lt;\u00a01 for short separation distances (r) in simulations of both clustered and unclustered proteins. Blurring by the super-resolution localization precision (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a030 nm) dramatically reduces the magnitude of depletion in the absence of protein clustering (blue points in b), but depletion is still apparent when proteins are clustered (blue points in d). This is because the size of the protein cluster is on the same order as the length scale of the Gaussian blurring. In contrast, no significant depletion is observed when blurring is applied to mimic conventional fluorescence microscopy (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a0220 nm) because the length scale of blurring is much longer than the size of protein and membrane phase-like structures. These results visually demonstrate that finite resolution limits reduce the magnitude of observed correlations. Also, in all cases, cross-correlation\u00a0functions tabulated from under-sampled images reproduce those of the fully sampled images within error bounds even though the images are visually very different. We also note that experimental super-resolution images are not able to accurately capture the fraction of the membrane occupied by one type of phase-like domain. For the example of the unclustered receptor with \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a030 nm, the fully-sampled image gives the false impression that the majority of the frame is occupied by green (disordered) components, even though it is actually only 50% of the total area. In contrast, the under-sampled image gives the visual impression that less than half of the frame is occupied by green disordered components. Both finite lateral resolution and under-sampling in space make it difficult to accurately determine the surface fraction occupied by phase-like domains in experimentally acquired super-resolution images."

The horizontal errorbar is centered around the average value and indicates the magnitude of the average error (dC<sub>2</sub>) determined by estimating error on single cell measurements of C(r) as described in the Materials and Methods. Since dC<sub>2</sub>(r) is not calculated for the first spatial bin (r\u00a0&lt;\u00a025 nm), we instead use the next bin (25\u00a0nm &lt; r &lt; 50 nm) for this comparison which likely underestimates the single cell error. The center of this errorbar is placed at the mean value of C(r\u00a0&lt;\u00a025 nm) which is not always the center of the Gaussian fit. The observation that the average error bar from a single cell measurement is close to the width of the distribution of single cell measurements indicates that errors are dominated by sampling statistics and not by other types of cell-to-cell variation."

                                "text": "We used similar methods to probe membrane heterogeneity in the vicinity of BCR and BCR receptor clusters. Endogenously expressed BCR was labeled with a biotinylated f(Ab)<sub>1</sub> against IgM, BCR was clustered with streptavidin acting as a generic antigen, and BCR clusters were imaged in combination with transiently expressed PM or TM peptides (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The sorting of phase sensitive peptides with respect to BCR clusters was observed in chemically fixed CH27 B cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), live CH27 B cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), and chemically fixed primary mouse B cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). In all cases we found that the PM peptide was enriched and the TM peptide was excluded from BCR clusters. Cross-correlation curves were\u00a0aggregated from multiple single-cell measurements, and error bars indicate the SEM between curves generated from single cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Variance in these measurements is dominated by probe sampling statistics (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and lipid probe expression density only weakly impacts the cross-correlation between BCR and lipid probes (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Again, we found\u00a0that the expression level of phase sensitive peptides impacts the magnitude but not the sign of peptide partitioning with respect to clustered BCR, allowing us to determine the type of domain stabilized by BCR clusters if not its quantitative composition. The direct measurements of peptide sorting shown here are generally consistent with past FRET and biochemical isolation measurements that argued that clustered BCR resides within ordered membrane domains (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cheng et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Pierce, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sohn et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">2008b</a>). The association between clustered BCR and the ordered domain marker PM appears more sustained in our imaging measurements than was observed in past reports using FRET (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sohn et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">2008b</a>), possibly due to the different length-scales probed by these methods."

The curved lines indicate a Gaussian fit to each histogram, demonstrating that values are normally distributed. The horizontal errorbar is centered around the average value and indicates the magnitude of the average error (dC<sub>2</sub>) determined by estimating error on single cell measurements of C(r) as described in Methods. Since dC<sub>2</sub>(r) is not calculated for the first spatial bin (r\u00a0&lt;\u00a025 nm), we instead use the next bin (25\u00a0nm &lt; r &lt; 50 nm) for this comparison which likely underestimates the single cell error. The center of this errorbar is placed at the mean value of C(r\u00a0&lt;\u00a025 nm) which is not always the center of the Gaussian fit. The observation that the average error bar from a single cell measurement is close to the width of the distribution of single cell measurements indicates that errors are dominated by sampling statistics and not by other types of cell-to-cell variation."

It is likely that this extended domain arises from additional signaling structures assembled proximal to BCR, as is observed in other immune-receptor signaling systems (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balagopalan et al., 2015</a>). For example, palmitoylated adapter proteins involved in signal transduction such as LAB/LAT2/NTAL may incorporate into activated BCR microclusters and act to extend the domain (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mutch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Malhotra et al., 2009</a>). Further, PM enrichment was reduced in cells treated with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 prior to receptor clustering and fixation (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), suggesting that ordered domain stabilization is amplified by receptor activation and the recruitment of down-stream signaling partners."

Here co-localization was quantified using a steady-state cross-correlation function (<a href=\"#bib77\">Stone and Veatch, 2015</a>). Additional sensitivity was obtained in these measurements by including probe pairs imaged within a time separation of up to 50 frames or approximately 1 s since we did not observe significant changes in steady state correlations over this window (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). We note that PM proximal to BCR did not exhibit altered mobility in live cells, indicating that PM enrichment arises from weak and/or transient interactions (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). As a counter-example, Lyn proximal to BCR does exhibit slowed diffusion, likely due to specific Lyn-BCR binding interactions. <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a> show single molecule localizations compiled over time for BCR-PM, BCR-TM, and BCR-Lyn, respectively.

This weak signal could indicate reduced partitioning of monomeric or pre-clustered BCR with ordered domains prior to streptavidin-induced clustering, or could simply reflect that domain sizes are at or below the finite lateral resolution of these measurements (~40 nm) (illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). At this time, we cannot comment on the oligomerization state of BCR prior to enforced clustering with streptavidin, because single color images of BCR contain over-counting artifacts that render monomers indistinguishable from small oligomers (<a href=\"#bib84\">Veatch et al., 2012</a>).

Sorting of order- and disorder-preferring probes around BCR clusters follows the same trends observed for clusters of an established marker of ordered domains, CTxB, and is consistent in fixed, live, and primary cells. Domains formed around clustered proteins share many of the features of domains observed in model membranes. Individual lipids are free to diffuse into and out of domains, suggesting that these domains are fluid. The amount of enrichment observed in these experiments is also consistent with expectations from ordered-disordered phase fluctuations in model systems above their transition temperatures (<a href=\"#bib83\">Veatch et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Machta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>), in contrast to the strong recruitment described in early work on membrane rafts (<a href=\"#bib67\">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</a>). Finally, the symmetry in the sign of correlations observed for order- and disorder-preferring probes and order- or disorder-preferring protein clusters is also consistent with the two liquid phase regime in model systems (<a href=\"#bib48\">Machta et al., 2012</a>). At the same time, the effects of lipid phase-mediated sorting are likely\u00a0superimposed on other interactions present within the complex milieu of the membrane, such as electrostatic interactions between charged peptides and lipids."

We investigated the role of membrane domains in the localization of two critical regulators of BCR activation, Lyn kinase and CD45 phosphatase (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dal Porto et al., 2004</a>), by comparing their spatial distribution around BCR to that of their membrane anchor peptides (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Both CD45 and its minimal anchor peptide CD45<sub>TM</sub> were excluded from BCR clusters to the same extent, indicating that membrane domain interactions are sufficient to drive this partitioning. Lyn kinase was more enriched in BCR clusters than its membrane anchor PM, consistent with the direct binding of Lyn to phosphorylated ITAM sequences on BCR mediated by SH2 interaction domains in full-length Lyn (<a href=\"#bib39\">Johnson et al., 1995</a>). The effective interaction energy between membrane anchors and BCR is given by the potential of mean force (PMF), which is simply obtained from measured cross-correlation functions (<a href=\"#bib84\">Veatch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Stone and Veatch, 2015</a>).

This was seen by visualizing the distribution of phosphorylated protein tyrosine residues (pY) with respect to protein clusters using a generic anti-pY antibody (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). BCR and CTxB clustering both induce local tyrosine phosphorylation co-localized with clusters, while TM clustering does not. This direct observation agrees with previous indirect measures of localized phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Harder and Simons, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cheng et al., 1999</a>). As expected, total pY enrichment was reduced in CTxB clusters compared to BCR clusters, since CTxB itself lacks sites for tyrosine phosphorylation and does not directly bind to additional proteins containing pY. However, enrichment in ordered domains stabilized by CTxB clustering is sufficient for phosphorylation of resident proteins, as is evident from the stronger co-localization of trans-activated (pY397) Lyn with CTxB clusters compared to overall Lyn (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). The membrane remodeling that occurs upon CTxB clustering is also sufficient to trigger a cellular response. In agreement with past reports (<a href=\"#bib22\">Francis et al., 1992</a>), we found that CTxB clustering leads to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) without significantly altering the distribution of BCR (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). CTxB binding and clustering also resulted in subtle increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein species detected within cellular extracts probed via Western blot (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We showed that ordered domains contribute a substantial fraction of the free energy required to concentrate the kinase Lyn and all of the free energy required to deplete the phosphatase CD45 from BCR clusters. Through this sorting, ordered domains provide a local environment that favors tyrosine phosphorylation, as supported by correlations between CTxB clusters and anti-pY antibodies even in the absence of specific recruitment of signaling machinery through protein-protein interactions. It is reasonable to expect that the\u00a0~50% increase in the ratio of Lyn to CD45 due to sorting by ordered domains could cause a significant change in BCR phosphorylation levels if we compare to results obtained for the related T cell receptor (TCR) system. In a reconstituted system, TCR phosphorylation was shown to have switch-like dependence on the relative concentrations of the Src kinase Lck, which is the analog of Lyn in the TCR system, and CD45 at physiological levels (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hui and Vale, 2014</a>). As a result, small increases in Lck concentration and decreases in CD45 concentration were shown to produce large shifts in TCR phosphorylation, and this behavior likely also applies to the BCR system investigated here. Additionally, the actual enrichment and depletion of probes around BCR and CTxB is larger than the measured values presented here since the real spatial distributions are convolved with the finite resolution of the measurement to give the observed cross-correlations. Lastly, local activation of Lyn within ordered domains also provides a potential mode of positive regulation. Concentration of Lyn in ordered domains and exclusion of phosphatases would be expected to favor Lyn trans-activation at Y397 and prevent inactivation. This would create an environment within ordered domains where Lyn is not only more concentrated but also more active, as has been suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib88\">Young et al., 2003</a>) and supported by the results shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>. Thus, distinct membrane environments could influence both the local concentration and activity of proteins, and these effects may amplify or negate one another to determine an overall signaling outcome."

The model consists of receptors that can be phosphorylated by kinases and dephosphorylated by phosphatases. In addition, activated receptors can phosphorylate other receptors, mimicking the actions of receptor-bound kinases (RBKs) such as Lyn and Syk (<a href=\"#bib39\">Johnson et al., 1995</a>). These protein components are embedded in a heterogeneous membrane represented by a 2D Ising model where extended ordered and disordered domains form at equilibrium through interactions between adjacent components (<a href=\"#bib47\">Machta et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2012</a>). This model represents phase-like heterogeneity as extended composition fluctuations that collectively emerge from weak intermolecular interactions when membranes are positioned near a miscibility critical point, and is supported by experiments in both purified and isolated biological membranes (<a href=\"#bib83\">Veatch et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Honerkamp-Smith et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). Receptors and kinases act as typical ordered components and phosphatases act as typical disordered components. Through this set of minimal assumptions, receptors became collectively activated upon clustering (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Clustered receptors were activated to a lesser extent in the absence of RBK positive feedback, but were not activated in a uniform membrane even with RBK feedback (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Videos 5</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">6</a>). This localized receptor phosphorylation may favor recruitment and assembly of adapter proteins that mediate the cellular immune response (<a href=\"#bib80\">Su et al., 2016b</a>)."

Receptor activation was more subtle in these simulations. This is because only a fraction of receptors reside within the ordered domain at a given time, receptors freely leave the protective environment of the ordered domain, and the local concentration of receptors within the domain is reduced compared to simulations with clustered receptors. In these simulations, we also find that the size of the ordered domain impacts the efficiency of receptor activation. This occurs because the residency time of a receptor within the domain increases with increasing domain size, as does the average number of receptors within the domain. Both of these factors increase the likelihood that the RBK positive feedback will amplify receptor activation."

Here, existing small, dynamic phase fluctuations were stabilized through clustering of ordered components to form a larger, stable domain structure of approximately the size of the cluster. This model quantitatively reproduces our imaging measurements of protein sorting by ordered domains, recapitulates clustering-induced BCR activation, and demonstrates that ordered domain formation alone can be sufficient to activate receptors. Further, phase-like heterogeneity is required for robust activation of BCR under these simulation conditions. The dependence of receptor activation on domain size in simulations where ordered domains are formed without BCR clustering (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>) highlights the collective nature of interactions that determine the local environment of receptors."

Acute modulation of cholesterol levels in intact cells with methyl \u03b2 cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) alters the surface fraction of coexisting ordered and disordered phases in GPMVs imaged at low temperature that were isolated from these cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). This occurs without an effect on cell viability as measured via annexin\u00a0V binding to the extracellular surface (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Past work indicates that this perturbation can also alter domain composition in vesicles at elevated temperature in a way that is quantitatively predicted by our model of membrane heterogeneity (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). In intact B cells, we observed increased calcium mobilization upon BCR clustering when cholesterol levels were acutely lowered with M\u03b2CD, in agreement with past work (<a href=\"#bib3\">Awasthi-Kalia et al., 2001</a>). We also observed decreased calcium mobilization upon BCR clustering in cells pretreated with M\u03b2CD-cholesterol complexes, which act to increase cellular cholesterol levels (<a href=\"#bib14\">Christian et al., 1997</a>). The observed changes in calcium mobilization are accompanied by changes in PM cross-correlation with BCR clusters that are also in line with model predictions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). PM is more strongly enriched in BCR clusters in cells pretreated with M\u03b2CD than in untreated cells, and less strongly enriched in cells pretreated with M\u03b2CD-cholesterol complexes."

Therefore, we expect that modulating cholesterol levels using M\u03b2CD impacts the composition of the plasma membrane of B cells in a way that parallels the changes in our minimal model: by varying the surface fraction of ordered vs. disordered components. This in turn alters peptide sorting around BCR clusters. The striking correspondence of the structural and functional outputs of the simulations to experimental measures of PM partitioning and BCR activation provides validation of the model and its assumptions."

In these experiments we visualized both enrichment and, for the first time, depletion of membrane species from phase-like domains in intact cells. This sorting behavior was induced both\u00a0by clustering generic membrane proteins with known phase partitioning in GPMVs and by clustering BCR. BCR clustering drove spatial co-localization or segregation of minimal membrane anchors from BCR clusters, consistent with the formation of an ordered phase-like domain. These domains also sorted BCR signaling partners into and out of receptor clusters. Experiments that examined functional outcomes of BCR signaling indicated that formation of an ordered domain through protein clustering creates a local membrane environment that favors protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Functional and imaging results are consonant with a simple but predictive model of membrane phase behavior."

                                "text": "Based on these observations and supported by the predictive model, we propose a mechanism where receptor clustering alone can initiate collective BCR activation by stabilizing an ordered membrane domain. This mechanism is distinct from some historical ideas of how \u201clipid rafts\u201d have been thought to play a role in BCR signaling, which pose that BCR actively partitions into pre-existing ordered domains upon clustering. Instead, our findings support the idea that receptor clusters template a lipid domain in the membrane by stabilizing existing but very subtle and transient membrane composition fluctuations. In the absence of clustering, the size and dynamics of fluctuations allows positive and negative regulators to mix with BCRs. When BCR is clustered, the effect on downstream signaling depends on the size and stability of the resulting domain, which sets the level of access signaling partners have to resident BCR. As a consequence, the structure of the BCR cluster and surrounding membrane can influence the activation state of individual BCRs. Thus, the entire cluster and associated domain, as opposed to single BCRs, comprise the basic signaling unit for the activation of B cells in this context. Super-resolution microscopy is particularly well-suited to capture this action-at-a-distance because it can measure interactions that span the length scale of the BCR cluster. While BCR activation in vivo by natural antigens likely involves signal integration from multiple sources, our work suggests that formation of phase-like ordered domains through a collective ensemble of relatively weak protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions impacts overall signaling outcomes. Thus, we both conclude that lipid-mediated interactions can play a significant role in signal transduction from BCRs activated through protein clustering and can describe a plausible mechanism for their action."

By extension, these findings suggest that membrane domains are capable of contributing to a broad array of signal transduction pathways by altering the local concentration of regulatory proteins, shifting the balance of biochemical networks. This compliments existing theories that invoke spatial compartmentalization of receptors and regulatory molecules as a means to control receptor signaling, including size-based exclusion (<a href=\"#bib13\">Choudhuri et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cordoba et al., 2013</a>) and 3D protein phase separation (<a href=\"#bib80\">Su et al., 2016a</a>) and places lipid-mediated interactions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Machta et al., 2012</a>) among other canonical forces that dictate protein interactions in membranes, such as electrostatics, curvature, and adhesion."

Here, labeled molecules are distributed randomly as shown in (<b>a</b>). When the localization precision (30 nm) is on the order of the pixel size (25 nm), then it acts to blur the image of molecular centers (<b>b</b>). The smooth blurred image represents a fully sampled PSF. In real localization microscopy images, single labeled molecules are typically localized multiple times, but not often enough to fully sample the super-resolved PSF. Instead the distribution represented by the blurred image is under-sampled. The smooth shape of the PSF is still evident when each PSF is sampled many times (c), but images appear more pixelated as this sampling is reduced (d). All of these factors impact the statistics of measured correlation functions. For all conditions indicated, the top panel shows a representative simulation snapshot for the condition indicated (scale-bar\u00a0=\u00a0500 nm) and the two dimensional cross-correlation, C(r, \u03b8), tabulated from this representative image. The next lower panel shows C(r, &lt;\u03b8&gt;) obtained by averaging C(r, \u03b8) over angles (red squares), as well as <c(r)>, the correlation function obtained by averaging over 100 simulation replicates (black circles). Error bars on these curves are either determined from the angular average as described in the main text (red squares, dC(r, &lt;\u03b8&gt;)), or by taking the SEM over 100 simulation replicates to obtain d<c(r)> (black circles). The bottom panels show how the square root of the variance (dC(r)) depends on radius for the conditions indicated. Black circular points show (d<c(r)>). Red squares show the dC(r, &lt;\u03b8&gt;) error averaged over the 100 replicates <dc(r, <\u03b8=\"\">)&gt;. The dC<sub>1</sub>(r) and dC<sub>2</sub>(r) points are corrections to dC(r, &lt;\u03b8&gt;) and are calculated as described in Methods. (<b>a</b>) dC(r, &lt;\u03b8&gt;) is a good estimate of d<c(r)> in simulations where the localization precision is much less than the pixel size and when there is good sampling of the super-resolved PSF. (<b>b</b>) dC(r, &lt;\u03b8&gt;) under-estimates d<c(r)> when labeled objects are detected with 30 nm localization precision but when these super-resolved PSFs are fully sampled.

Images were acquired on an iXon-897 EMCCD camera (Andor, South Windsor, CT). Excitation of Atto 655 was accomplished using a 647 nm solid state laser (OBIS, 100 mW, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) when imaged in conjunction with mEos3.2, or a 640 nm diode laser (CUBE 640-75FP, Coherent) when imaged in conjuction with Alexa 532. Excitation of mEos3.2 constructs was accomplished using a 561 nm solid state laser (Sapphire 561 LP, Coherent). Photoactivation of mEos3.2 was accomplished with a 405 nm diode laser (CUBE 405-50FP, Coherent). Excitation of Alexa 532 was accomplished with a 532 nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (Samba 532\u2013150 CW, Cobolt, San Jose, CA). Laser intensities were adjusted such that single fluorophores could be distinguished in individual images, and were generally between 5 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> and 20 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Excitation and emission was filtered using a LF405/488/561/647 quadband cube (TRF89902, Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) or a 532/640 dualband cube (TRF59907, Chroma). Emission was split into two channels using a DV2 emission splitting system (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ) using a T640lpxr dichroic mirror to separate emission, ET605/52m to filter near-red emission, and ET700/75m to filter far-red emission (Chroma).

The ensemble of peaks was then culled to remove outliers in brightness, size, and localization error using in-house MATLAB software (<a href=\"#bib84\">Veatch et al., 2012</a>). For live cells, single molecules were localized in raw live cell movies with the ImageJ plugin ThunderSTORM (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ovesn\u00fd et al., 2014</a>), using weighted least-squares fitting of an integrated Gaussian PSF with multi-emitter fitting analysis enabled to detect up to two single molecules within a diffraction-limited area. Localization data were then exported to our in-house MATLAB software for culling and successive post-processing steps (<a href=\"#bib84\">Veatch et al., 2012</a>). Localizations in the near-red emission channel were registered with the far-red emission channel using a registration technique published previously (<a href=\"#bib15\">Churchman et al., 2005</a>) and previously used by our group (<a href=\"#bib76\">Stone and Veatch, 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib77\">2015</a>). Stage drift correction was performed every 500 frames by finding the maximum in the 2D cross correlation produced by all localizations between successive groups of frames. Super-resolution localizations were used to reconstruct super-resolved images after correcting for stage drift and channel registration by incrementing the intensity of pixels at positions corresponding to localized single molecules. The super-resolved images have an arbitrary pixel size of 25 nm, and the original images have a pixel size of 160 nm, corresponding to the pixel size of the EMCCD camera. For the purposes of display, localizations were grouped such that probes observed within a small (typically 80 nm) radius in sequential frames were merged and counted as a single localization. Note that this grouping correction does not account for multiple observations of the probe imaged at different times, for example as a result of reversible activation. Histograms of localized positions were blurred as described in figure captions and image contrast was adjusted for display purposes. The resolution of particle localization was close to 30 nm for all probes, determined by correlation-based methods as detailed previously (<a href=\"#bib84\">Veatch et al., 2012</a>). This resolution is larger than the localization precision of the Gaussian fits because it includes contributions from other sources of error (e.g. from stage drift)."

Cross-correlation functions report on the enrichment or depletion of distinguishable probes with respect to one another, normalized by a random co-distribution of probes. Thus, the magnitude of the cross-correlation yields information about interactions of labeled objects with one another that may cause their co-distributions to deviate from a random co-distribution. This methodology is demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> using imaging of dually-labeled clathrin coated pits as an example. Clathrin coated pits were imaged in HeLa cells transiently expressing two distinct labeled clathrin heavy chain proteins, one conjugated to mEos3.1 (green) and a second conjugated to GFP that is antibody labeled with Alexa\u00a0647 (magenta). Clathrin was chosen for this demonstration because a large number of individual clathrin proteins assemble within clathrin coated pits, which are sparsely distributed within the cell, therefore their co-localization is easily identified when viewing the reconstructed image. A reconstructed image of a HeLa cell showing the distributions of super-resolved localizations arising from both clathrin constructs is shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>."

The point distribution of distinguishable probes surrounding an example magenta probe is shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>. In this case, there are many more green points located at small separation distances from the example magenta point than at large separation distances because the magenta point chosen was located at the center of a clathrin coated structure. These pairwise distances are collected within the radial bins given by the dotted lines. The complete correlation function tabulates these separation distances around all magenta probes in the image. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a> shows the histogram describing the distribution of separation distances for all pairs from the cell shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>. In general, the number of pairs in each bin increases linearly with increasing radius for large separation distances because the area corresponding to each bin also increases linearly, as A \u2248 2\u03c0r\u0394r. These histograms are then normalized by the total number of observations divided by the area of the cell and multiplied by the area of the bins. This normalization is equivalent to the number of observations expected in each bin given a random distribution of pairs across all bins, and is shown as a red line in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>. Importantly, this normalization simply accounts for variation in expression level between cells (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and corrects for boundary effects that arise due to the finite extent and shape of the ROI. The cross-correlation function can be equivalently calculated from reconstructed images of all localizations using fast Fourier transforms, as has been described previously (<a href=\"#bib84\">Veatch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Stone and Veatch, 2015</a>). In this case, a two dimensional cross-correlation is tabulated, C(r, \u03b8), and then C(r) is obtained by averaging over angles. Generally, C(r) is tabulated from ungrouped images, meaning that localizations detected within a small radius in sequential frames are counted independently. Ungrouped images are used because cross-correlation functions are not impacted by probe over-counting (<a href=\"#bib84\">Veatch et al., 2012</a>) and this reduces possible errors introduced by the grouping technique. The properly normalized cross-correlation function for this cell is shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>."

In this case, C(r) \u2248 1 for separation distances much larger than the size of individual clathrin structures, meaning that the pits themselves are roughly\u00a0randomly distributed on the cell surface. C(r) is slightly larger than one even at separation distances approaching 1 \u00b5m because clathrin structures are more densely localized on the edge of this cell than towards the center. In some instances, we subtract this long distance offset in order to remove long range contributions to C(r) which are not currently under investigation. The vast majority of cross-correlation functions reported in the main text have much smaller amplitudes than the one shown in this example. This is because co-localization is much weaker and/or domains are more numerous.

When the spatial distributions are well-sampled, then co-localization is easily apparent both visually in the image and quantitatively in the tabulated correlation function. When spatial sampling is low, co-localization is no longer apparent in images, and in fact probes can appear anti-correlated because sampling is so sparse that localizations are unlikely to be overlapping.

This is because both probes are necessarily absent in regions where the membrane has lifted from the glass surface, which makes probes correlated. The normalization of the cross-correlation function properly accounts for complex regions of interest. Significant efforts were made to minimize the impact of membrane topology, but in some cases this was complicated by low spatial sampling of labeled proteins and peptides. Especially in cases where spatial sampling is low, user-defined ROI have the potential to introduce systematic bias that could impact cross-correlation results. In some cases, cells were analyzed without user knowledge of the sample condition, and results were indistinguishable within noise.

In brief, cross-correlation functions were computed on a frame-by frame basis from localizations in each channel that occurred in the same frame or in frames separated by a time delay \u03c4. Cross-correlations between frames with time separation of up to 50 frames (0 s &lt; \u03c4\u00a0&lt;\u00a01 s) did not decay significantly (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) and were therefore averaged to obtain a steady-state cross-correlation for data collected in a time window between 0 and 6 min after clustering with streptavidin. Long-range gradients in labeling density arise in live-cell data because labeled molecules continually diffuse onto the ventral membrane from the dorsal membrane during the imaging experiment. The dorsal membrane is outside the reach of TIRF illumination and away from the high laser power that both converts probes to a fluorescent 'off' state and slowly bleaches them. Therefore, probes near the edges of the cell footprint are more likely to reside in a fluorescent 'on' state, and as a result these areas are more densely sampled. To compensate for the effects of this long-range structure on our measurement, we normalize steady-state cross-correlations by the cross-correlation function of the masked average images from each channel which are first convoluted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function with \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a01 \u00b5m. This treatment filters structure larger than 1 \u00b5m in size from the steady-state cross-correlation function."

Briefly, components that prefer ordered or disordered regions are represented as pixels that have value of S\u00a0=\u00a0+1 and S\u00a0=\u00a0-1 respectively. The vast majority of\u00a0+1 and \u22121 pixels represent unspecified membrane components (proteins and lipids). In addition, 50 pixels with values of\u00a0+1 are classified as receptors, 100 pixels with values\u00a0+1 are classified as kinases, and 100 pixels with values \u22121 are classified as phosphatases. Receptors are clustered by applying a strong attractive circular field (\u03c6<sup>R</sup>) at the center of the simulation frame that only acts on receptors. The final Hamiltonian is given by:"

In this scheme, the critical point occurs at T<sub>C</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02/ln(1+sqrt(2)). All simulations were run at T\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0T<sub>C</sub>. One pixel is chosen to represent a 2 nm by 2 nm patch of membrane, so that the correlation length varies with temperature in simulations with equal fractions of ordered and disordered components as observed in experimental observations in isolated plasma membrane vesicles (<a href=\"#bib83\">Veatch et al., 2008</a>). Most simulations were run such that there were an equal fraction of ordered and disordered unspecified membrane components. In some cases, the fraction of unspecified membrane compositions assigned to be ordered was varied, as indicated in Figure captions. Uniform simulations were run by setting all unspecified membrane components to be disordered."

All simulations are initially run using non-local exchanges to decrease equilibration times.

Simulation sweeps are converted to time assuming a diffusion coefficient of roughly 4 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s, with one sweep corresponding to roughly 1 \u03bcs.

If a move is accepted that places a receptor neighboring a phosphatase, then the receptor is dephosphorylated at a high probability (100%). These probabilities are chosen to produce a low level of phosphorylation in simulations that contain an equal number of kinases and phosphatases with unclustered receptors. Higher probability of dephosphorylation is physiologically relevant because phosphatases such as CD45 are expressed in the plasma membranes of lymphocytes at several-fold higher densities than Src kinases (e.g. T cells express between 100,000 and 500,000 CD45 molecules and between 40,000 and 120,000 Lck molecules per cell (<a href=\"#bib55\">Olszowy et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hui and Vale, 2014</a>). In some simulations, receptors have kinase behavior when they are phosphorylated. In this case, a move that places a phosphorylated receptor next to a second receptor results in the second receptor becoming phosphorylated at a low probability (0.1%)."

They have expressed these in a B cell in CH27 and allowed these cells to spontaneously adhere to glass surfaces. They perform super-resolution microscopy on the location of the probes in the presence or absence of BCR or cholera toxin binding site cross linking and establish very nice cross correlations between the organic dyes associated with the cross-linked surface receptors and the mEos probes. They find that the LO associated probes correlated with the BCR or CT clusters, whereas the TM, GG or CD45 TM based probes are anti correlated. They develop a model to explain BCR signalling in response to BCR cross linking in terms of phase separation of Src family kinases and CD45 at sites of BCR cross linking induced local lipid phase separation. They demonstrate that these effects are present in primary B cells and robust to the fixation taking place at 37 degrees."

However, this does not appear to be the case as nearly all the findings presented here were published using fluorescence resonance energy transfer in living cells to follow the association of the BCR with membrane probes with time after BCR clustering (please see Sohn et al. 2006 PNAS; Sohn et al. 2008 J. Cell Biol.; and Tolar et al. 2005 Nat. Immunol.). In fact, the superresolution imaging is less well suited to the analysis as interactions of the BCRs with lipids are highly dynamic and as opposed to live cell imaging in which the association of the BCRs with lipids can be followed continuously the authors provide data for only two time points. For this manuscript to be considered for publication the authors would need to review the literature on this subject and make it clear what their novel contribution is."

Also, it was not clear to me whether these were from cells on the same day or from completely different labeling and cell culture set ups. N =2 was described in the Methods, except for primary cells. I would add this info to the figure legends and also increase the N for the primary cells. Also in many cases the number of cells analyzed seems low, given that one can acquire a reasonable number super-resolution images of cells in one day (I would think more than 20 cells would be possible, especially as there are probably more than one cell in a field of view.)."

Its assumed that this will explain the discrepancy. Some supplemental figures should be presented with the relevant signal presented in full range linear grey scale to show that \"actual\" surface densities with the actual level of co-clustering of segregation in BCR clusters indicated (perhaps the BCR cluster regions could be circles as they may not be as visible as in the contrast boosted versions. This will be helpful to general readers to understand why this issue has been so difficult to solve.

Since the GG reporter failed in the CTxB tests in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> perhaps it is better to remove it and this would streamline the paper. The GG probe and variants of it could be the subject of a future study that dissects the acidic lipid hypothesis, which is interesting, but here just a distraction."

One specific issue is that in most images, the PM, TM and CD45 probes appear to be in non-percolating, finite clusters and perhaps collectively cover &lt;10% of the area. If both PM and TM probes appear to be in clusters, is there a percolating phase and which phase is this? The modelling certainly incorporates this concept, but how does the imaging, which usually shows isolated clusters relate to the modelled areas. Do the probes all appear clustered, because like the GG probe, they typically detect at least one other feature, in addition to the lipid order. Or is the appearance of clustering due to membrane topology?"

Cell Biol.; and Tolar et al. 2005 Nat. Immunol.). In fact, the superresolution imaging is less well suited to the analysis as interactions of the BCRs with lipids are highly dynamic and as opposed to live cell imaging in which the association of the BCRs with lipids can be followed continuously the authors provide data for only two time points.

In our case, many of the clusters lack of apparent overlap with membrane probes because the underlying distributions of the membrane probe do not sample all space. That is, the labeling density of the membrane probe is sparse compared to the spatial resolution of the measurement. This is mainly due to limits of expression of this exogenous probe. In conventional fluorescence microscopy images, unless labeling density is very low, typically structures are sampled at a density higher than the resolution of the measurement. In other words, labeling density is higher than 1/(250nm)^2 and the labeling of structures appears continuous. This is often not the case for super-resolution microscopy images because the lateral resolution is considerably better. As a result, especially if labels are more or less randomly distributed across the membrane as is the case for the lipid probes, the images give the visual impression that the labels are self-clustered in domains. In fact, individual labels, which are over-counted, are separated from each other by distances greater than the resolution of the measurement but their distribution is still close to random. This can be more easily seen if fixed-cell super resolution images are compared to live cell super-resolution images (shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 11). The distributions of lipid probes appear more uniform in live cell measurements because probes are mobile and allowed to sample more lateral space as they reversibly blink on and off, but the cross-correlation curves show nearly the same relative distributions between BCR and lipid probes as in fixed cells. To help illustrate this idea we have also included a figure supplement to <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), which shows that decreasing probe density impacts the visual impression of apparent co-localization as well as statistical variation in the correlation function, but does not change the average cross-correlation function."

This is also the reason why even distributions of probes that are not clustered appear punctate."

Hui et al. (Nat. Struct. and Molec. Bio. 2014) showed that, in a reconstituted system, that the phosphorylation state of the CD3\u03b6 subunit of the T cell receptor is \u201cultrasensitive\u201d to changes in the relative concentrations of Lck and CD45 and displays switch-like behavior in the transition from the inactive to active states at physiological concentrations of both enzymes. They also showed that perturbations that alter the spatial organization of CD3\u03b6 and/or Lck such as receptor clustering could alter the \u201cswitch\u201d concentrations at which CD3\u03b6 becomes phosphorylated. We observe not only a depletion of CD45 but also an enrichment of Lyn co-localized with BCR clusters, and if we observe a 20% increase in Lyn due to its lipid anchor and a 20% decrease in CD45 concentrations within BCR domains, this amounts to a 50% change overall in the ratio of Lyn to CD45 attributable to lipid-driven sorting. If we draw a direct analogy with the cooperativity observed in the Lck/CD45/CD3\u03b6 system, a 50% change in Lck/CD45 ratio could at most increase the total fraction of activated BCR by 20%. This difference very well may be sufficient for surpassing some signaling threshold for cell activation, and additional mechanisms of positive feedback (e.g. local regulation of Lyn activity) could amplify the effect."

While we cannot exclude the possibility that labeled proteins or peptides are not independently distributed due to some strong self-clustering interaction, it is more likely that the appearance of self-clustering comes from multiple observations of the same probe, since we are not attempting to limit the number of times each protein or peptide is observed.
