In this study, we adapt lentiviral vectors as carriers of designer nuclease proteins, providing efficient targeted gene disruption in vector-treated cell lines and primary cells. By co-packaging pairs of ZFN proteins with donor RNA in \u2018all-in-one\u2019 lentiviral particles, we co-deliver ZFN proteins and the donor template for homology-directed repair leading to targeted DNA insertion and gene correction. Comparative studies of ZFN activity in a predetermined target locus and a known nearby off-target locus demonstrate reduced off-target activity after ZFN protein transduction relative to conventional delivery approaches. Additionally, TALEN proteins are added to the repertoire of custom-designed nucleases that can be delivered by protein transduction. Altogether, our findings generate a new platform for genome engineering based on efficient and potentially safer delivery of programmable nucleases."

In this study, we adapt lentiviral vectors as carriers of designer nuclease proteins, providing efficient targeted gene disruption in vector-treated cell lines and primary cells. By co-packaging pairs of ZFN proteins with donor RNA in \u2018all-in-one\u2019 lentiviral particles, we co-deliver ZFN proteins and the donor template for homology-directed repair leading to targeted DNA insertion and gene correction. Comparative studies of ZFN activity in a predetermined target locus and a known nearby off-target locus demonstrate reduced off-target activity after ZFN protein transduction relative to conventional delivery approaches. Additionally, TALEN proteins are added to the repertoire of custom-designed nucleases that can be delivered by protein transduction. Altogether, our findings generate a new platform for genome engineering based on efficient and potentially safer delivery of programmable nucleases."

ZFNs and TALENs are chimeric nucleases composed of a custom-designed DNA binding domain fused to the DNA-cleavage domain from the FokI endonuclease that upon dimer formation cleaves the DNA. ZFN- and TALEN-induced DSBs trigger genome editing through cellular repair mechanisms involving either error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) with an available DNA donor template. Designer nucleases have broad applications in biological experimentation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Urnov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bogdanove and Voytas, 2011</a>) and have been successfully utilized for the production of gene knockout model animals (<a href=\"#bib14\">Doyon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Geurts et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tesson et al., 2011</a>) and in emerging gene therapies (<a href=\"#bib43\">Perez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sun et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "The safety of designer nucleases is of major concern in relation to their use in treatment of human diseases. Thus far, ZFNs and TALENs have been administered to cells by transfection or electroporation of nucleic acids, DNA or RNA, encoding a pair of nuclease proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Urnov et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Miller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carlson et al., 2012</a>) or by exploiting viral gene vehicles such as integrase-deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lombardo et al., 2007</a>), adeno-associated virus-derived vectors (AAV vectors) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ellis et al., 2013</a>), or adenoviral vectors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Holkers et al., 2013</a>). Successful administration of ZFN- or TALEN-encoding genes leads to high intracellular levels of nucleases and furthermore imposes a risk of random insertion in the genome, resulting potentially in prolonged nuclease expression and accumulating events of off-target cleavage. Ideally, ZFNs and TALENs are provided in a \u2018hit-and-run\u2019 fashion allowing short-term and dose-controllable nuclease activity without losing the effectiveness of creating locus-directed DSBs. Towards this goal, ZFNs have been fused to destabilizing domains regulated by small molecules to attenuate ZFN toxicity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pruett-Miller et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, by exploiting the cell-penetrating capability of ZFNs, targeted gene disruption has recently been achieved by direct cellular delivery of purified ZFN proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gaj et al., 2012</a>). Although such approach may require multiple treatments due to the reduced cellular uptake of proteins (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mellert et al., 2012</a>), recent findings suggest that ZFN uptake may be further improved by ligand-mediated endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). However, for gene correction by homology-directed repair such strategies would need to be combined with other means of delivering the donor template."

                        "text": "It has been known for decades that retroviruses can tolerate the incorporation of heterologous proteins (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jones et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Weldon et al., 1990</a>). Lentiviral particles (LPs) have been engineered to carry foreign proteins for the purpose of visualizing the intracellular behavior of the virus during infection (<a href=\"#bib34\">McDonald et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jouvenet et al., 2008</a>) and altering the viral integration profile (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bushman, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goulaouic and Chow, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bushman and Miller, 1997</a>), as well as for ferrying antiviral (<a href=\"#bib42\">Okui et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ao et al., 2008</a>) and antitumor (<a href=\"#bib32\">Link et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miyauchi et al., 2012</a>) protein therapeutics. As the delicate structural composition of HIV-1-derived lentiviral particles is easily disturbed by an inappropriate load of nonviral proteins, leading to suboptimal vector yields and/or reduced transduction capability, various strategies for transducing heterologous protein cargo have been scrutinized. In early strategies, the accessory HIV-1 protein Vpr was adapted as a carrier of fused proteins (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wu et al., 1995</a>). Recently, Vpr fusions have been shown also to ferry Cre recombinase (<a href=\"#bib37\">Michel et al., 2010</a>) and I-SceI meganuclease (<a href=\"#bib25\">Izmiryan et al., 2011</a>) into transduced cells. However, HIV-1 virions incorporate relatively few copies of Vpr (estimated 700 copies Vpr per virion [<a href=\"#bib49\">Swanson and Malim, 2008</a>]), and the therapeutic potential of such approach may be hampered further by the known toxicity of the Vpr protein (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tachiwana et al., 2006</a>). Alternatively, nonviral proteins may be packaged in LPs as part of the Gag polypeptide, as was previously shown for reporter proteins like GFP (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2011</a>) and the apoptosis-inducing caspase 3 protein (<a href=\"#bib40\">Miyauchi et al., 2012</a>). During virion maturation, Gag is processed by the viral proteins into shorter proteins constituting the structural\u2014and most abundant\u2014proteins of the virus particle. It is estimated that each virion contains 5000 copies of Gag and 250 copies of GagPol (<a href=\"#bib49\">Swanson and Malim, 2008</a>). We recently adapted LPs for the delivery of the <i>piggybac</i> DNA transposase (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cai et al., 2014</a>). The transposase was released from Gag in the virus particles in a protease-dependent manner and found to be able to facilitate efficient DNA transposition in transduced cells. In yet another strategy, heterologous proteins fused to the integrase in the Pol region of the GagPol polypeptide were successfully delivered by protein transduction (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schenkwein et al., 2010</a>)."

We produce ZFN-loaded lentiviral particles that induce high-efficiency gene disruption with a favorable on-target/off-target ratio in safe genomic harbors like the <i>CCR5</i> locus. Also, gene disruption and repair is evident in cells treated with particles carrying TALEN proteins. Successful incorporation of nuclease proteins within lentiviral particles allows co-delivery of nucleases and the donor template for homology-directed repair.

We began by incorporating ZFNs targeting the <i>egfp</i> reporter gene (<a href=\"#bib53\">Urnov et al., 2005</a>) into the <i>gag</i> gene of a packaging construct harboring the IN D64V mutation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), rendering the viral integrase (IN) incapable of catalyzing vector insertion. An HIV-1 protease cleavage site (SQNY/PIVQ) was included between the ZFN and the PH domain to allow the release of functional ZFN proteins during particle maturation. LPs harboring HA-tagged left and right <i>egfp</i>-targeting ZFNs, respectively, were produced separately and analyzed for their particle content by Western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). For both ZFN-loaded LPs, we detected HA-tagged ZFNs of the predicted, full-length size (\u223c37.5 kDa), demonstrating that the majority of the virion-associated ZFNs was correctly released from the Gag and GagPol polypeptides during particle maturation. The identity of this band was confirmed by control analyses including plasmid-encoded HA-tagged ZFN protein (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Nevertheless, both longer and shorter forms of the ZFNs were evident (indicated by ZFN* in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), suggesting that processing was not complete and that proteolytic cleavage had also occurred outside the inserted cleavage site, despite the fact that neither the ZFNs nor the PH domain contained naive HIV-1 cleavage sites. Release of ZFN and p24 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, left and right panels, respectively) from ZFN-PH-GagPol polypeptides was inhibited by treatment of the virus-producing cells with the HIV-1 protease inhibitor Saquinavir (SQV), confirming that polypeptide cleavage, and the resulting release of ZFN proteins, was dependent on the HIV-1 protease."

For both loci and in all cell types, we observed significant levels of disruption and found that such disruption occurred in an LP dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In HEK293 cells and HKs, we consistently observed an extra band (indicated by * in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, left panels) that was confirmed by sequencing to originate from the <i>CCR5</i> \u039432 allele present in these cells. To evaluate the extent of cleavage and error-prone repair at the <i>CCR5</i> and <i>AAVS1</i> loci induced by LP-delivered pairs of ZFNs, we cloned and sequenced PCR products encompassing the targeted regions. For both loci and in all three cell types, numerous different indels could be identified in the targeted region of the genome (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Table 1\u2014source data 2 and 3</a>). The rates of gene disruption by both <i>CCR5</i>- and <i>AAVS1</i>-targeting ZFNs (using an amount of LPs corresponding to 200 ng p24) are summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. For the three cell types, the percentage of sequenced clones harboring targeted disruptions in the <i>CCR5</i> locus ranged from 17% in HEK293 cells and NHDFs to 24% in primary HKs, whereas from 13% to 20% of the analyzed <i>AAVS1</i> loci, depending on the cell type, harbored indels. In summary, our findings demonstrate potent targeted gene disruption and knockout by lentiviral delivery of ZFN pairs targeting predetermined loci in the human genome."

By packaging a vector genome harboring a HR donor sequence into LPs, we reasoned that ZFNs and donor could be co-delivered in such \u2018all-in-one\u2019 lentiviral vectors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We generated, therefore, a donor vector plasmid carrying a 2.1-kb long sequence with homology to the <i>egfp</i> cassette present in the HEK293-eGFPmut cell line. This vector did not itself express eGFP, but served as donor for robust repair of <i>egfp</i> (leading to eGFP production) in HEK293-eGFPmut cells that were transfected with donor-containing plasmid DNA and treated with increasing dosages of LP-ZFNLR(gfp) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Hence, at a dose of 300 ng p24, LP-ZFNLR(gfp) induced a level of repair that was comparable to that obtained by the efficient co-transfection of plasmid DNA encoding the two ZFNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, compare two right columns). Next, the donor sequence was delivered by integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLV/donor), allowing the reverse-transcribed vector to serve as a recombination donor during HR-directed editing. Co-delivery of IDLV/donor and LP-ZFNLR(gfp) to the HEK293-eGFPmut cells induced gene repair, whereas neither IDLV/donor nor LP-ZFNLR(gfp) alone induced significant levels of eGFP expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

We designed a shuttle plasmid that is compatible with the Golden Gate assembly method (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cermak et al., 2011</a>) and equivalent to pTAL3, allowing us to isolate the DNA segment carrying the assembled TALEN sequence and insert it into GagPol in the correct reading frame (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). HEK293-eGFPmut reporter cells were transduced with increasing amounts of LP-TALENLR(gfp) carrying both the left and right TALEN proteins designed to recognize sequences flanking the mutations in the <i>egfp</i> gene. Gene disruption was identified by Surveyor nuclease-directed detection of mismatches in re-annealed PCR products (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and confirmed by sequencing of cloned PCR products. Hence, 3 out of 46 sequenced alleles (6.5%) were found to contain indels as a result of the treatment with LP-delivered TALEN proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Moreover, by transfecting the cells with plasmid DNA containing the donor sequence prior to treatment of the cells with LP-TALENLR(gfp), we found that 0.2% of the cells were eGFP positive (as measured 15 days after transduction), whereas control treatments without LPs and donor DNA, respectively did not trigger eGFP expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These findings demonstrated the capacity of lentivirally delivered TALEN proteins to facilitate targeted gene repair. Notably, Western blot analysis of viral particles harboring an HA-tagged version of one of the two TALEN proteins fused to the GagPol polypeptide unveiled a cleavage pattern indicative of substantial proteolytic cleavage within the TALEN domain of the fusion protein, leading to truncated versions of the protein (indicated by TALEN* in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Although a low level of full-length TALEN protein with the same mobility as HA-tagged TALEN protein expressed in cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, upper band marked by \u2018TALEN\u2019) was indeed evident in the particles, these data indicated the presence of cryptic HIV-1 protease cleavage sites internally in the TALEN protein.

Derivatives of Gag polypeptides are the most abundant proteins in HIV-1-derived particles, and each virion has been estimated to contain approximately 5000 copies of Gag-derived proteins like p24 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Swanson and Malim, 2008</a>). Hence, such strategy for transduction of proteins is superior in terms of cargo load. Though IDLVs have been exploited to deliver ZFN-encoding genes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lombardo et al., 2007</a>), there are some clear inherent limitations to this approach. Firstly, random integration of the vector can lead to insertional mutagenesis and sustained expression of ZFNs may cause cytotoxicity or chromosomal aberrations. Secondly, two separate IDLVs are necessary to provide the two ZFNs and a third IDLV needs to be included if a donor template is required for homologous recombination. Single IDLVs encoding both ZFNs have recently been described, but these do not perform as well as two separate IDLVs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Joglekar et al., 2013</a>). Thirdly, due to the highly repetitive sequences in TALENs there are major difficulties in delivering these by IDLVs due to an inherent propensity of lentiviral vectors to undergo recombination during reverse transcription (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mikkelsen and Pedersen, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Holkers et al., 2013</a>)."

At an MOI of approximately 34, such \u2018all-in-one\u2019 vectors edited the reporter gene in up to 8% of treated cells. We also provide proof-of-principle that \u2018all-in-one\u2019 vectors can target the insertion of additional genetic sequences in the form of a linker sequence, suggesting that HR-mediated insertion facilitated by transduced ZFN proteins has a potential as a tool for targeted lentiviral insertion."

Although a direct comparison is not possible, we reason that a high rate of repair after protein transduction reflects the combined capacity of LPs to (i) coordinately deliver pairs of nucleases by protein transduction and (ii) provide a donor for homologous recombination which is associated with the pre-integration complex and therefore is actively and efficiently translocated to the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coluccio et al., 2013</a>). We have previously observed that the uptake of LP-delivered heterologous proteins is extremely limited relative to the very high levels of nuclear protein that can be achieved by standard plasmid DNA transfection (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cai et al., 2014</a>). Based on these findings, we currently favor a model by which editing is further supported by the co-localization of ZFN proteins and the donor template within the pre-integration complex. In several aspects, such model mimics the ability of conventional lentiviral vectors to carry the integrase protein along with the reverse-transcribed vector DNA into the nucleus."

However, TALENs are relatively large proteins (\u223c100 kDa), and this may challenge their delivery. In addition, lentiviral delivery of TALEN-encoding genes is further complicated by frequent recombination between the highly similar sequence repeats encoding the DNA-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib23\">Holkers et al., 2013</a>), and lentiviral delivery of genes encoding re-coded TALE variants has been reported so far only for transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). In this study, we show that TALENs can be delivered as proteins by LPs, facilitating gene disruption or, in the presence of a donor template, repair in a reporter cell line. However, the majority of virally incorporated TALEN subunits are cleaved internally by the HIV-1 protease, which is suspected to limit the overall efficiency. Further work is necessary to identify and eliminate the cryptic viral protease cleavage site to improve the delivery of virus-incorporated TALEN proteins."

To analyze this aspect, we compared ZFN-directed disruption in the <i>CCR5</i> target locus and the nearby and highly similar <i>CCR2</i> locus. Interestingly, LPs loaded with <i>CCR5</i>-directed ZFNs caused disruptions in the <i>CCR5</i> locus more effectively than ZFNs expressed from transfected plasmid DNA. In the same cells, disruptions in the off-target <i>CCR2</i> locus were evident with all concentrations of plasmid but detectable only with the highest and most effective dose of LPs. Importantly, under experimental conditions that allowed similar rates of disruption using LP-directed ZFN delivery and plasmid-encoded ZFN production, off-target activity within the <i>CCR2</i> locus was detected only after ZFN-encoding plasmid delivery. These findings support the notion that LP-delivered ZFNs target a safe harbor in the human genome with an improved on-target/off-target cleavage ratio. We reason that such improvement is a combined effect of efficient transduction and the short-term exposure to transduced ZFN proteins."

Same nomenclature applies to TALEN. A similar type of particle harboring, for example, only the left ZFN was accordingly designated LP-ZFNL(target). When a lentiviral genome was included for example as a carrier of a HR donor sequence, we referred to this vector as an IDLV (due to presence of the IN D64V mutation, rendering the vector integrase-defective). These vectors were named with the specification of the incorporated ZFNs and the donor that were included. IDLV-ZFNLR(gfp)/donor, for example, contains both <i>egfp</i>-directed ZFNs (left and right) and RNAs of which reverse transcription products carry a donor sequence with homology to <i>egfp</i>. Of note, we have consistently observed that virions harboring Gag fused N-terminally to foreign proteins are strongly reduced in their capability of transferring vector RNA (most likely due to complications during reverse transcription), but that this capacity can be restored by including unfused GagPol (encoded by pMDlg/pRRE-D64V) in the virions. Preparations of LPs and IDLVs were produced as follows. On day 1, 293T cells were plated at a density of 6 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. On day 2, cells were transfected with calcium phosphate precipitates of plasmid DNA. To produce LPs, 293T cells in 15-cm dishes were transfected with 10 \u03bcg pMD.2 G, 30 \u03bcg pZFNL(target)-PH-gagpol-D64V (targeting either <i>gfp</i>, <i>CCR5</i>, or <i>AAVS1</i>) and 30 \u03bcg pZFNR(target)-PH-gagpol-D64V (targeting either <i>gfp</i>, <i>CCR5</i>, or <i>AAVS1</i>). LPs containing TALENs were produced accordingly except using pTALENL(gfp)-PH-gagpol-D64V and pTALENR(gfp)-PH-gagpol-D64V instead of corresponding ZFN constructs. To produce IDLVs that did not incorporate foreign protein, cells in 15-cm dishes were transfected with 9.07 \u03bcg pMD.2G, 7.26 \u03bcg pRSV-Rev, 31.46 \u03bcg pMDlg/pRRE-D64V, and 31.46 \u03bcg pLV/egfp-donor-re.

Primers and probe specific for the <i>albumin</i> gene were used to quantify the cell number in each qPCR reaction assuming an <i>albumin</i> gene copy number of two per genome. WPRE and <i>albumin</i> DNA copy numbers were determined using standard curves with serially diluted plasmid containing the two targets. For WPRE, the pCCL-PGK-Puro-H1-MCS plasmid was used (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bak et al., 2011</a>) and for <i>albumin</i> we used pAlbumin kindly provided by Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid #22037).

Our original intention was to illustrate to the reader that lentiviral delivery of ZFN proteins provides levels of editing that are comparable with levels of editing obtained by transfection of ZFN-encoding plasmids. Based on the fact that plasmid transfection is so efficient in HEK293 and that editing processes thus should not suffer from suboptimal transfection rates, we reasoned that the comparison would be reasonable. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that transfection rates can be further optimized and basically do not intend to conduct a side-by-side comparison with focus on editing efficiency.

As the combined delivery of ZFNs and donor sequence is central to the studies of repair, we have focused our experimentation and derived calculations on providing the exact numbers of infectious particles (IDLVs) that are required to obtain repair. Please see point 2 for further details. In the revised manuscript, we have added details on the estimated number of Gag protein derivatives in matured lentiviral virions. We cannot at present compare the \u2018transducability\u2019 of LPs (without DNA) and IDLVs and therefore will not be able to estimate the exact number of ZFNs in LPs. However, as mentioned in the Discussion, we have previously shown that the uptake of LP-delivered heterologous proteins in transduced cells is very limited relative to cells with plasmid-based expression (Cai et al. PMID:24270790). Hence, although LPs transduce cells with very high efficiency they only deliver small amounts of heterologous proteins to each cell. Thus, we find it unlikely that high efficiency of repair using lentiviral protein transduction reflects unusually high levels of protein at the time when the cells were harvested for analysis of gene disruption or repair. More likely, the editing process may benefit from the high local concentration of ZFNs in virus-derived complexes within transduced cells. We have further strengthened the wording in the Discussion."

We carried out qPCR on lentiviral DNA intermediates (total DNA) in transduced HEK293 cells and determined the number of lentiviral DNA copies relative to the copies of the endogenous albumin gene in IDLV-treated cells. Using this strategy, we obtained exact MOIs for IDLVs carrying the donor sequence (IDLV/donor) and ZFN-loaded IDLVs carrying the donor (IDLV-ZFNLR(gfp)/donor) and found that the overall transduction capacity of ZFN-containing IDLVs was reduced about 5-fold relative to the control. Based on these experiments, we have added MOIs (or details on number of infectious particles) in all IDLV-based repair experiments. Our data show that MOIs in the range of 17-34 used throughout the paper facilitate efficient repair.
