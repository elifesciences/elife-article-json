Approximately 22% of individuals treated with vemurafenib develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) during therapy. The prevailing explanation for this is drug-induced paradoxical ERK activation, resulting in hyperproliferation. Here we show an unexpected and novel effect of vemurafenib/PLX4720 in suppressing apoptosis through the inhibition of multiple off-target kinases upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), principally ZAK. JNK signaling is suppressed in multiple contexts, including in cSCC of vemurafenib-treated patients, as well as in mice. Expression of a mutant ZAK that cannot be inhibited reverses the suppression of JNK activation and apoptosis. Our results implicate suppression of JNK-dependent apoptosis as a significant, independent mechanism that cooperates with paradoxical ERK activation to induce cSCC, suggesting broad implications for understanding toxicities associated with BRAF inhibitors and for their use in combination therapies."

Approximately 22% of individuals treated with vemurafenib develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) during therapy. The prevailing explanation for this is drug-induced paradoxical ERK activation, resulting in hyperproliferation. Here we show an unexpected and novel effect of vemurafenib/PLX4720 in suppressing apoptosis through the inhibition of multiple off-target kinases upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), principally ZAK. JNK signaling is suppressed in multiple contexts, including in cSCC of vemurafenib-treated patients, as well as in mice. Expression of a mutant ZAK that cannot be inhibited reverses the suppression of JNK activation and apoptosis. Our results implicate suppression of JNK-dependent apoptosis as a significant, independent mechanism that cooperates with paradoxical ERK activation to induce cSCC, suggesting broad implications for understanding toxicities associated with BRAF inhibitors and for their use in combination therapies."

Their clinical use is associated with the development of keratinocytic tumors including cSCC (<a href=\"#bib22\">Flaherty et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chapman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sosman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hauschild et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Falchook et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42a\">Long et al., 2012</a>). Mechanistic studies of this have centered on paradoxical ERK activation, which is most evident in <i>BRAF</i>-wild-type, <i>RAS</i>-mutant cells, as the primary mechanism (<a href=\"#bib38\">Karreth et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Halaban et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Heidorn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Poulikakos et al., 2010</a>). This is supported by the findings that <i>RAS</i> mutations are significantly enriched in cSCC arising in patients treated with vemurafenib relative to sporadic cSCC (<a href=\"#bib47\">Oberholzer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Su et al., 2012</a>), and by the low rate of cSCC in patients treated with combined BRAFi and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) (<a href=\"#bib22a\">Flaherty et al., 2012</a>). In one model, drug binding relieves the autoinhibition of BRAF whereupon it is recruited to the membrane by activated RAS and dimerizes with CRAF, driving MEK-dependent ERK activation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Heidorn et al., 2010</a>). Other studies show ERK hyperactivation resulting from drug-induced CRAF transactivation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Poulikakos et al., 2010</a>) and modulation of RAS spatiotemporal dynamics (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cho et al., 2012</a>). Inhibitor-induced KSR1-BRAF dimers modulate the activity of ERK (<a href=\"#bib43\">McKay et al., 2011</a>) and also affect MEK signaling by activating KSR1 kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brennan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hu et al., 2011</a>). These models all highlight the importance of CRAF in driving MEK-dependent hyperactivation of ERK."

Phospho-JNK levels in particular were highly upregulated upon UV irradiation and were significantly suppressed by treatment post-radiation with 1 \u03bcM PLX4720 in cSCC and HaCaT cell lines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Similar effects were seen with 1 \u03bcM vemurafenib (data not shown) and in cells stressed with doxorubicin (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Importantly, ERK signaling remained intact, as evidenced both by the paradoxical activation of ERK (upregulation of phospho-ERK) and by the failure to upregulate BIM levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>). This pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member is upregulated by inhibition of ERK signaling (<a href=\"#bib16\">Collins et al., 2005</a>) and in <i>BRAF</i><sup><i>V600E</i></sup> melanoma cells treated with vemurafenib (<a href=\"#bib50\">Paraiso et al., 2011</a>). Since NOXA is a downstream effector of UV-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Naik et al., 2007</a>), we examined its expression and found that NOXA expression is induced by UV irradiation and suppressed by PLX4720 in all cell lines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), suggesting that inhibition of NOXA expression may be a mechanism of PLX4720-induced suppression of apoptosis. Finally, we examined the expression of the antiapoptotic BCL2 family member MCL1 because it is downregulated by UV exposure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), but as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib50\">Paraiso et al., 2011</a>), unaffected by PLX4720 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>)."

UV-induced apoptosis was significantly suppressed (approximately 70%) by vemurafenib in these cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), and the UV-induced upregulation of phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 was likewise suppressed most significantly at 6 and 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). As in the cSCC and HaCaT cell lines, activation of ERK was observed following exposure to vemurafenib (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The presence of cleaved caspase-3 correlated with high levels of apoptosis in the UV-treated cells and its absence with rescue by vemurafenib at 24 hr post-irradiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In probing members of the BCL2 family, we found similar results to those in the cSCC and HaCaT cell lines. BIM and MCL1 were unaffected by vemurafenib but NOXA induction at 24 hr post-UV irradiation was diminished by vemurafenib (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The advantage of using primary cells is that <i>p53</i> is intact. In NHEKs, p53 is stabilized by 24 hr post-UV irradiation and this is unaffected by vemurafenib (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, since BCL2 family members can be modulated by JNK (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tournier et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Haeusgen et al., 2011</a>) and p53 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Oda et al., 2000</a>) in apoptosis, the inhibition of NOXA expression by PLX4720 and vemurafenib (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1G and 2C</a>) likely reflects <i>p53</i>-independent regulation of NOXA given that <i>p53</i> is mutant in HaCaT (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lehman et al., 1993</a>) cells, p53 is undetectable in SRB12 cells, and p53 levels do not change with radiation in SRB1, COLO16, or HaCaT cells, (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). PUMA, BAX, BCL2, BCL-XL, and BCL2A1 expression were unchanged following irradiation and were unchanged by PLX4720 or vemurafenib exposure (data not shown, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We conclude from our results that vemurafenib and PLX4720 suppress UV-induced apoptosis by inhibiting JNK signaling and NOXA induction in <i>BRAF</i> and <i>RAS</i> WT cells."

(<b>D</b>) Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of ZAK singly or in combination with MKK4 and MAP4K5 (triple knockdown, \u2018TKD\u2019) was performed revealing potent suppression of apoptosis as measured by FACS for Annexin V+, TMRE-low cells (n = 5, \u2018*\u2019 denotes statistical significance at p&lt;0.05, \u2018**\u2019 at p&lt;0.01, \u2018NS\u2019 is not significant) at 24 hr following single dose UVB irradiation at 720 J/m<sup>2</sup>. ZAK knockdown and triple knockdown cells exhibit 70% and 94% suppression of apoptosis, respectively, relative to PLX4720-treated cells expressing a non-suppressing shRNA control (scramble, \u2018SCR\u2019). (<b>E</b>) Western blots of lysates obtained at 1 and 6 hr post-UV irradiation show potent induction of phospho-MKK4, phospho-MKK7, and phospho-JNK which are all suppressed with progressively increasing effect in ZAK single knockdown (\u2018shZAK2\u2019) and triple knockdown (\u2018TKD\u2019) HaCaT cells. (<b>F</b>) Western blots of HaCaT cells electroporated with pcDNA3-wild-type (WT) ZAK and the gatekeeper mutant pcDNA3-(T82Q) ZAK show equivalent expression. (<b>G</b>) HaCaT cells overexpressing ZAK (WT) and ZAK (T82Q) were irradiated with a single dose of UVB irradiation at 720 J/m<sup>2</sup> in the absence (\u2018o\u2019) and presence (\u2018+\u2019) of 1 \u03bcM PLX4720 and apoptosis measured by FACS for Annexin V+, TMRE-low cells (n = 4, \u2018**\u2019 at p&lt;0.01, \u2018NS\u2019 is not significant) at 24 hr. ZAK (WT) cells are sensitive to PLX4720-mediated suppression of apoptosis (bar 3 vs 4), but drug-treated ZAK (T82Q)-expressing cells undergo significantly more apoptosis than drug-treated ZAK (WT) cells (bar 4 vs 8), with bypass of PLX4720-induced suppression as compared to drug-treated ZAK (WT) cells (paired t-test, p=0.005). (<b>H</b>) Western blots of ZAK (WT) and ZAK (T82Q)-expressing HaCaT cells at 1 hr and 6 hr post-irradiation show that phospho-JNK activation is intact in both cell lines in the absence of drug (lanes 3, 7), but that drug-treated ZAK (T82Q)-expressing HaCaT cells have significantly more phospho-JNK activation at both 1 and 6 hr post-irradiation, as compared to drug-treated ZAK (WT)-expressing cells (lane 4 vs 8)."

Approximately 54.6% knockdown (ImageJ) of MAP4K5 is observed in TKD cells. (<b>B</b>) HaCaT cells, expressing non-silencing scramble-shRNA (\u2018SCR\u2019), shZAK1, shZAK2, or TKD, were either unirradiated (black bars) or irradiated (open bars) with 1 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> of UVB in the absence (\u2018o\u2019, 1:2000 DMSO) or presence (\u2018+\u2019) of 1 \u03bcM PLX4720 and analyzed by FACS for apoptosis (Annexin V+, TMRE-) at 24 hr. UV-induced apoptosis is significantly suppressed by both ZAK shRNA clones in HaCaT cells and in TKD cells. The shZAK2 clone, which results in less knockdown than shZAK1, produces correspondingly less suppression of UV-induced apoptosis (93.7% for shZAK1 vs 67.8% for shZAK2). shZAK1-expressing HaCaT cells, TKD cells, and PLX4720-treated HaCaT scrambled-shRNA-expressing cells show similar degrees of suppression, again consistent with the fact that ZAK can account for the majority of the effect of BRAFi-induced suppression of JNK signaling. (<b>C</b>) HaCaT cells, treated as above, were processed for Western blots at 1 and 6 hr following UV exposure to assess JNK activation. Significant suppression of phospho-JNK is observed at 1 hr and 6 hr post-irradiation in all cell lines where ZAK is knocked down, as well as TKD cells and SCR cells treated with PLX4720. In comparing the shZAK1 and shZAK2-expressing HaCaT cells, the degree of phospho-JNK inhibition correlates exactly with the degree of knockdown of ZAK particularly at 1 hr: less phospho-JNK inhibition is observed with less ZAK knockdown."

HaCaT cells with knockdown of ZAK (\u2018shZAK2\u2019) showed a strong suppression of ZAK protein expression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and of UV-induced apoptosis, showing 70% suppression of apoptosis relative to that achieved by PLX4720 in control (\u2018SCR\u2019) cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). An additional clone of shRNA against ZAK (\u2018shZAK1\u2019) showed similar results (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>), demonstrating that even greater knockdown of ZAK can account for nearly the entire effect of PLX4720 on JNK activation and apoptosis. Western blots show significant suppression of phospho-MKK4/MKK7 in shZAK2 knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Triple knockdown cells (\u2018TKD\u2019) with combined shRNA knockdown of ZAK, MKK4, and MAP4K5 kinases, as confirmed by Western (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), showed comparable suppression of apoptosis to that of drug-treated control cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and substantial suppression of phospho-MKK4/MKK7 induction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Furthermore, single knockdown of MKK4 and MAP4K5 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), only partially suppresses UV-induced apoptosis or phospho-JNK induction in HaCaT cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). Knockdown of ZAK alone was able to account for 91.3% of the suppression of UV-induced apoptosis in a distinct cell line, SRB1 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>), with corresponding suppression of phospho-JNK induction (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). As knockdown of ZAK alone can account for up to 93.7% of the effect of PLX4720 treatment, we conclude that the potent inhibition of JNK activation and resultant apoptosis by PLX4720 and vemurafenib is due to the off-target inhibition of ZAK principally, with smaller additional contributions from inhibition of MKK4 and MAP4K5, which abrogates the activation of the two kinases essential for JNK phosphorylation and activation: MKK4 and MKK7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2H\u2013I,3D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

To show that PLX4720 suppresses apoptosis primarily through direct action on ZAK in cells, we employed a chemical-genetic approach by engineering a gatekeeper mutant ZAK (T82Q). Gatekeeper mutant kinases, in which the threonine (T) is replaced by a larger amino acid, in our case glutamine (Q), are often rendered insensitive to small molecule inhibitors and are an important mechanism of drug resistance (<a href=\"#bib18\">Daub et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Whittaker et al., 2010</a>).

Following depilation, mice were irradiated once using a solar simulator (Oriel) with 10 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> UVB. The skin was harvested at 1 hr, 6 hr, and 24 hr post-irradiation. Consistent with our other results, we found significant apoptosis of epidermal keratinocytes in irradiated mouse skin that was suppressed by PLX4720 treatment (12.7 \u00b1 0.4 apoptotic cells/mm vs 4.9 \u00b1 0.3 apoptotic cells/mm skin, [n = 3 pairs], p&lt;10<sup>\u22125</sup>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>), a finding corroborated by cleaved caspase-3 levels, which were induced within 6 hr of irradiation and suppressed in PLX4720-treated mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). As expected, phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 were significantly upregulated following UV irradiation and phospho-JNK was significantly suppressed by PLX4720 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). The upstream kinases MKK4 and MKK7 were likewise activated by UV radiation and suppressed by PLX4720 at 1 and 6 hr post-irradiation, confirming the importance of this mechanism of PLX4720-induced JNK signaling suppression in vivo. Finally, Noxa mRNA expression, as measured by qPCR, was strongly induced by UV exposure, a response significantly dampened by PLX4720 treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>)."

The cohorts (n = 5 each) were identically irradiated thrice weekly (12.5 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> per week UVB) for 72 days before starting on PLX4720 treatment vs vehicle control. Within 20 days of administration of drug, hyperkeratotic papules were visible on the backs of PLX4720-treated animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), which steadily grew into cSCC over the following several weeks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>).

To accomplish this, we took advantage of the fact that paradoxical ERK activation requires intact <i>CRAF</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Heidorn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Poulikakos et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We used isogenic, matched WT and <i>Craf</i>-deficient (<i>Craf</i>\u2212/\u2212) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and transformed them with adenovirus E1A and human <i>HRAS</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> to enable anchorage-independent growth (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These <i>Craf</i>\u2212/\u2212 cells do not exhibit strong paradoxical MEK or ERK activation, consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib51\">Poulikakos et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Wild-type and matched <i>Craf</i>-deficient MEFs were plated in soft agar assays (<a href=\"#bib57\">Su et al., 2012</a>) and treated with PLX4720. Both WT and <i>Craf</i>-deficient MEFs exhibited a significant colony formation advantage in the presence of drug (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>). Based upon this analysis, we estimated that the effect of paradoxical ERK activation to be 60% and other effects, including inhibition of JNK activity, to account for the rest (40%) of the total colony growth advantage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). To assess the role of JNK signaling directly, we used <i>HRAS</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup>-transformed HaCaT cells with (\u2018TKD\u2019) and without (\u2018SCR\u2019) triple lentiviral knockdown of ZAK, MAP4K5, and MKK4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>), to perform similar colony formation assays to assess responses to PLX4720 treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Drug treatment conferred a significant colony formation advantage in both sets of cells, which exhibit equivalent paradoxical ERK activation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Yet, untreated TKD HaCaT cells produced more colonies than SCR HaCaT cells suggesting that JNK pathway suppression results in an advantage in the absence of drug and paradoxical ERK activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Drug-treated SCR and TKD HaCaT cells, had elevated colony counts to similar levels, as expected, because both lines would experience similar degrees of both paradoxical ERK activation and JNK inhibition, and TKD cells (knocked down for ZAK, MAP4K5, MKK4) are unlikely to experience any further suppression of JNK signaling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Based on this, we estimated the effect of JNK pathway inhibition to be 17.6% (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). When combined with the MEF experiment, we estimate that the effect of JNK inhibition contributes approximately 17.6\u201340% of the total effect of PLX4720-accelerated colony formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). Importantly, although we can quantify these individual contributions, it is clear in many contexts in cancer that hyperproliferation and inhibition of apoptosis are highly cooperative (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>), and our data do not preclude the possibility that one or both are individually required."

The difference between colony formation advantages conferred by 1.0 \u03bcM PLX4720 in WT vs <i>Craf</i>\u2212/\u2212 MEFs was interpreted to reflect the contribution of paradoxical ERK signaling (red arrow), which depends upon <i>Craf</i>, and is 60% of the total effect (black arrow), with the remainder composed of other effects including JNK inhibition (blue arrow).

We interpreted this as being reflective of differences between vemurafenib and dabrafenib, as opposed to unequivocal proof that paradoxical ERK activation is the only mechanism involved. To explore this further, we used similar assays to assess the effects of dabrafenib on apoptosis, JNK signaling, and colony formation. In stark contrast to vemurafenib, dabrafenib has little effect on apoptosis and JNK signaling at doses that are biologically equivalent based upon growth inhibition of <i>BRAF</i><sup><i>V600E</i></sup> melanoma cells and human pharmacokinetic data (<a href=\"#bib21\">Falchook et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gowrishankar et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

We profiled dabrafenib activity against ZAK, MKK4, and MAP4K5, and found that ZAK is a significant off-target kinase for dabrafenib as well, but at 0.01 \u03bcM, over 64% of activity is retained (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>).

Our studies implicate the off-target binding and inhibition of these compounds to ZAK primarily (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>), with additional contributions of MKK4 (MAP2K4) and MAP4K5 inhibition, thus implicating inhibition of JNK signaling at all three upstream tiers of MAP kinase signaling (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Although MKK4 knockdown alone could suppress UV-induced apoptosis and phospho-JNK induction by up to 27.3% (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), this is expected, given that ZAK signals through MKK4 and MKK7 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gross et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I,3E,4H</a>) and MKK4 is important (with MKK7) for full JNK activation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tournier et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Haeusgen et al., 2011</a>).

The clinical observation is that the incidence of SCC increases in patients treated with vemurafenib, which has been attributed to paradoxical increased RAF signaling due to the unrestrained activity of CRAF. Here they show that vemurafenib also inhibits a number of other serine threonine kinases including ZAK, which regulates JNK signaling. Expression of a ZAK mutant that cannot be inhibited by vemurafenib blocks this effect. The authors also demonstrate that dabrafenib has a different spectrum of kinase inhibition, suggesting that SCC may be less prevalent in patients treated with this inhibitor."

At least 71.9% knockdown was achieved for two MKK4 and MAP4K5 shRNA clones (Image J densitometry). The effect on apoptosis and phospho-JNK suppression is greater with MKK4 knockdown (up to 27.3%). This is however, completely expected, since MKK4 is important for full activation of JNK activity and ZAK has been shown to be upstream of MKK4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2H, I, 3E</a>), thus implying that the effect of ZAK induction proceeds, at least in part, through MKK4. Consistent with this, we have also shown that ZAK knockdown and drug treatment suppresses phospho-MKK4 induction following irradiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2H, I, 3E</a>).
