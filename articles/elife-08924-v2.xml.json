Yan is at the core of a regulatory network that determines the time and place in which cells transit from multipotency to one of several differentiated lineages. Using a fluorescent reporter for Yan expression, we observed a biphasic distribution of Yan in multipotent cells, with a rapid inductive phase and slow decay phase. Transitions to various differentiated states occurred over the course of this dynamic process, suggesting that Yan expression level does not strongly determine cell potential. Consistent with this conclusion, perturbing Yan expression by varying gene dosage had no effect on cell fate transitions. However, we observed that as cells transited to differentiation, Yan expression became highly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity was transient. Signals received via the EGF Receptor were necessary for the transience in Yan noise since genetic loss caused sustained noise. Since these signals are essential for eye cells to differentiate, we suggest that dynamic heterogeneity of Yan is a necessary element of the transition process, and cell states are stabilized through noise reduction."

Yan is at the core of a regulatory network that determines the time and place in which cells transit from multipotency to one of several differentiated lineages. Using a fluorescent reporter for Yan expression, we observed a biphasic distribution of Yan in multipotent cells, with a rapid inductive phase and slow decay phase. Transitions to various differentiated states occurred over the course of this dynamic process, suggesting that Yan expression level does not strongly determine cell potential. Consistent with this conclusion, perturbing Yan expression by varying gene dosage had no effect on cell fate transitions. However, we observed that as cells transited to differentiation, Yan expression became highly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity was transient. Signals received via the EGF Receptor were necessary for the transience in Yan noise since genetic loss caused sustained noise. Since these signals are essential for eye cells to differentiate, we suggest that dynamic heterogeneity of Yan is a necessary element of the transition process, and cell states are stabilized through noise reduction."

When EGFR is activated, Pnt is produced and Yan is degraded. When this receptor is not activated, Yan is produced and represses Pnt. Mathematical modelling of these interactions has concluded that this is a bistable system: that is, cells should either have high levels of Yan and low levels Pnt, or low Yan levels and high Pnt levels. However, larval eye cells first activate, and then turn off, both proteins together. This argues against bistability and raises questions about how these proteins regulate cell fate transitions in the eye, and perhaps in other organs."

The Rb-E2F pathway generates bistability in E2F expression, which dictates the transition from G1 to S phase (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yao et al., 2008</a>). Expression of the transcription factor PU.1 determines lymphoid versus myeloid hematopoietic cell lineages (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kueh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Laslo et al., 2006</a>). Adipocyte differentiation is controlled by differential expression of C/EBP and PPAR\u03b3 proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Park et al., 2012</a>). Regulation by positive feedback is a hallmark of bistable systems, and in all of the above cases, the transcription factors act in one or more positive feedback circuits. In some systems, positive feedback is generated by two transcription factors that mutually repress each other\u2019s expression. In these scenarios, cells in one state continually express a transcription factor that represses a second transcription factor, and when these cells transit to another state, they continually express the second transcription factor, which represses its antagonist. Fate restriction in hematopoietic, neural, pancreatic, and muscle cell lineages is regulated by such double-negative feedback circuits (<a href=\"#bib3\">Briscoe et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Laslo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Olguin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schaffer et al., 2010</a>)."

One remarkable exception to this rule is found in <i>Drosophila</i>. There, two ETS-domain transcription factors act in a wide assortment of cell types across the body and across the life cycle. Yan and Pointed (Pnt) act downstream of signals mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that regulate cell differentiation, migration, and division in tissues ranging from ovarian follicular cells, dorsal and ventral neuroectoderm, embryonic mesoderm, the embryonic trachea, and the post-embryonic compound eye (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dumstrei et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gabay et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Halfon et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jurgens et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Morimoto et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">O'Neill et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ohshiro et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yao et al., 2008</a>) It is thought that Yan and Pnt control such diverse cell states by acting in concert with tissue-specific transcription factors to regulate transcription of appropriate target genes. For instance, transcription of <i>even-skipped</i> occurs in mesoderm only if Yan/Pnt act in combination with Tinman and Twist proteins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Halfon et al., 2000</a>), whereas transcription of <i>prospero (pros</i>) in the eye only occurs if Yan/Pnt act in combination with Lozenge, Sine Oculis, and Glass proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hayashi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Xu et al., 2000</a>)."

The best characterized is the embryonic ventral ectoderm, where ventral-most cells express Pnt and more lateral cells express Yan (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gabay et al., 1996</a>). This pattern is established by secretion of a ligand for the EGF Receptor (EGFR) from the ventral midline (<a href=\"#bib19\">Golembo et al., 1996</a>). EGFR activation in nearby ventral cells induces the Ras-MAPK pathway to express Pnt and degrade Yan (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gabay et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Melen et al., 2005</a>). Cells with insufficient EGFR activation express Yan, which represses Pnt.

In contrast, when retinal progenitor cells transit to differentiated cone cell fates, they maintain their expression of both proteins.

Yan exhibits monostability, both in progenitor and differentiating cells, with Yan levels varying in cells in either state. Cell state transitions occur independent of absolute Yan concentrations, suggesting that some other mechanism allows Yan to regulate transitions. One such mechanism might be the noise in Yan levels, which undergoes a transient spike as cells begin to transition to differentiated states. Loss of EGFR signaling, which prevents cells from differentiating, causes these cells to have prolonged noisy Yan expression, and suggests that Yan noise is key for cell state transitions in the eye."

During the larval phase of the life cycle, the disc grows in size by asynchronous cell division. During the final 50\u2009hr of the larval phase, a morphogenetic furrow (MF) moves across the eye disc from posterior to anterior (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). All cells arrest in G1 phase within five cell diameters anterior to the furrow, and then as the furrow passes through them, periodic clusters of cells express the proneural gene <i>atonal</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jarman et al., 1994</a>). <i>Atonal</i> expression is subsequently restricted to one cell per cluster, which becomes the R8 photoreceptor. Each R8 cell then secretes an EGFR ligand that activates the receptor in neighboring cells and causes them to transit from multipotent progenitor to differentiated states (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Freeman, 1996</a>). Transitions occur in a sequence of symmetric pairs of multipotent progenitor cells that differentiate into R2/R5, R3/R4, and R1/R6 photoreceptors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib57\">Wolff and Ready, 1993</a>). Thereafter, a single progenitor transits to a R7 photoreceptor fate followed by two pairs of cells, C1/C2 and C3/C4, that differentiate into cone cells. These cone cells are non-neuronal and form the simple lens that overlies each cluster of eight photoreceptors. The furrow induces the nearly simultaneous differentiation of a column of R8 cells, with repeated column inductions producing approximately 800 units or ommatidia as the furrow moves across the eye."

Nuclei were manually classified into the different cell types of the eye, which is possible because every cell undergoing differentiation can be unambiguously identified by its position and nuclear morphology without the need of cell-specific markers (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ready et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tomlinson, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tomlinson and Ready, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wolff and Ready, 1993</a>). To validate our identification of all cell types using this method, we cross-checked with specific cell-specific markers, and found that our classification was accurate over 98% of the time (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Cells were scored for nuclear Yan-YFP concentration and their exact position within 3D coordinate space of each fixed eye sample (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Yan-YFP protein levels were normalized to His2Av-mRFP, which provided some control over measurement variation (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We then mapped each cell\u2019s spatial position in the x-y plane of the eye disc onto time. Two reasons made this possible. First, the furrow moves at an approximately constant velocity forming one column of R8 cells every two hours (<a href=\"#bib1\">Basler and Hafen, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Campos-Ortega and Hofbauer, 1977</a>). Second, each column of R8 cells induces the other cell fates at a constant rate (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lebovitz and Ready, 1986</a>). Thus even in a fixed specimen, the temporal dynamics of cell state transitions are visible in the repetitive physical organization of ommatidia relative to the furrow (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Together these features allow the estimation of time based on a cell\u2019s position relative to the furrow (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This can be applied repeatedly to hundreds of cells in a single sample, creating a composite picture of the dynamics (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013F</a>). Although the developmental progression of an individual cell cannot be measured by this approach, it nevertheless provides a dynamic view of hundreds of cells across a developing epithelium as they respond to signaling processes. From this information, individual cell behaviors can be reconstructed and modeled."

Approximately eight hours after R8 definition, Yan-YFP levels peaked, and thereafter gradually decayed until Yan-YFP approached its basal level again. The results are surprising in two ways. First, Yan-YFP is not maintained at a stable steady state within progenitor cells, which would have been predicted by the bistable model. Rather, its dynamics are reminiscent of monostable responses to transient stimuli, with a single basal steady state. Second, at the peak of Yan-YFP expression, there is remarkably large heterogeneity in Yan-YFP levels across cells."

Cells entering the R3/R4 and R1/R6 states began with Yan-YFP levels that were approximately two-fold greater than cells entering the R2/R5 states. Cells entering the R7 state were intermediate between these two extremes. Despite these differences at the transition point, Yan-YFP levels decayed to a similar basal steady state irrespective of the photoreceptor type, and this basal level was at least three-fold lower than that which the progenitor cells achieved (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>).

Given the unanticipated Yan-YFP dynamics, we wanted to ask whether and how they were influenced by EGFR signaling. <i>EGFR</i> null mutants are inviable; however, a temperature sensitive (ts) allele of <i>EGFR</i> enables controlled inactivation of the RTK\u2019s activity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kumar et al., 1998</a>). We grew <i>EGFR<sup>ts</sup></i> mutant larvae at a restrictive temperature for 18\u2009hr before analyzing effects on Yan-YFP. Surprisingly, progenitor cells exhibited biphasic expression of Yan-YFP over time, but the amplitude of the pulse in expression was significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This suggests that EGFR signaling contributes to the stimuli that induce the Yan-YFP peak. To further test this hypothesis, we misexpressed a constitutively active form of Ras protein in eye cells. The peak of Yan-YFP in progenitors was now prolonged (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Together, these results suggest that EGFR-Ras signaling stimulates the transient appearance of Yan-YFP in progenitor cells, and that the decline in Yan-YFP within older progenitor cells is linked to a loss of signal reception by these cells over time."

Conversely, misexpression of constitutively active Ras caused a premature decline in Yan-YFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These results are consistent with EGFR-Ras stimulating the degradation of Yan-YFP as cells switch their states. However, Yan-YFP dropped to below-normal levels in <i>EGFR<sup>ts</sup> </i>mutant R2/R5 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These complex effects suggest a dual role for EGFR signaling in photoreceptors. In the first few hours as cells transit to a photoreceptor state, EGFR stimulates the accelerated decay of Yan-YFP. Thereafter, EGFR inhibits the decay of Yan-YFP in a manner that might be related to that role that EGFR plays in boosting Yan-YFP levels in progenitor cells."

At odds with this view, Pnt and Yan proteins are co-expressed in progenitor and differentiating cells of the eye (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boisclair Lachance et al., 2014</a>). Since Pnt proteins act downstream of many RTKs including EGFR, we wondered if Pnt mediated the positive effects of EGFR-Ras signaling on Yan-YFP in progenitor cells. Null mutants of the <i>pnt</i> gene are embryonic inviable; therefore we generated clones of eye cells that were null mutant for <i>pnt</i> in an otherwise wildtype animal. Mutant progenitor cells showed a reduction in Yan-YFP levels as they progressed through their biphasic expression pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Thus, Pnt possibly mediates the positive effect of EGFR signaling on Yan-YFP expression in progenitors. We also wished to know if Pnt mediates the complex effects of EGFR in differentiating photoreceptors. Pnt proteins are rapidly cleared in photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boisclair Lachance et al., 2014</a>) and so loss-of-function mutant analysis would be uninformative. Therefore, we overexpressed PntP1 or constitutively-active PntP2 in cells as they transited into a photoreceptor state and beyond. The early phase of Yan-YFP decay was accelerated while the later phase of Yan-YFP decay was inhibited (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>).

To test this idea, we varied the number of <i>Yan-YFP</i> gene copies. In general, protein output is proportional to gene copy number in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lucchesi and Rawls, 1973</a>). We increased <i>Yan-YFP</i> copy number from its normal diploid number to tetraploid, and monitored Yan-YFP in progenitors and differentiating cells. As expected, four copies caused a higher steady-state level of Yan-YFP in progenitor cells, though this increase was less than two-fold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The amplitude of the Yan-YFP pulse was also increased as progenitor cells aged. Strikingly, as four-copy progenitor cells transited to a differentiated state, the onset of Yan-YFP decay occurred at the same time as it occurred for two-copy cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). Yan-YFP levels were much greater in four-copy cells compared to two-copy cells making their transit into the identical cell states. To confirm that absolute Yan-YFP concentration had little effect on cell state transitions, we examined expression of a direct target of Yan in R7 cells: the <i>pros</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kauffmann et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Xu et al., 2000</a>). Expression was monitored with an antibody specific for Pros protein. We observed at most a one hour delay in the onset of Pros expression in R7 cells containing four copies of <i>Yan-YFP</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), far less than the ten-hour delay predicted if absolute concentration of Yan-YFP dictated when Pros expression begins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

An examination of Yan-YFP decay in photoreceptor cells makes that possibility less likely; Yan-YFP decays to different basal levels in two- versus four-copy differentiated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). To further test this notion, we fit the data to several plausible functional forms. We found that exponentially decaying functions systematically best-fit to the data (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, for each cell state we fit an exponential decay function to its Yan-YFP temporal profile (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). From these fits, we derived the average decay rate constants and half-lives of Yan-YFP for cells carrying two, four, or six copies of <i>yan</i>. As expected, we found that Yan-YFP half-life was different between progenitors and differentiating photoreceptors (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The half-life in photoreceptors was two-fold lower than in progenitors, accounting for the more rapid loss of Yan-YFP in the former cells. Strikingly, Yan-YFP half-life was not significantly affected by <i>yan</i> copy number within either progenitor or photoreceptor cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Thus, Yan-YFP concentration only affected its decay rate as a first-order function, implying that there is no higher order mechanism to accelerate Yan-YFP decay when cells contain greater concentrations of Yan-YFP."

One potential explanation is that Yan\u2019s effect on cell states actually depends on variability in Yan protein levels. A growing body of evidence is pointing to the importance of transient fluctuations in expression of factors to control cell states (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cahan and Daley, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Torres-Padilla and Chambers, 2014</a>). Key regulators of stem cells fluctuate in abundance over time, and this is correlated with stem cells existing in multiple connected microstates, with the overall structure of the population remaining in a stable pluripotent macrostate (<a href=\"#bib35\">MacArthur and Lemischka, 2013</a>). Heterogeneity among cells is not simply due to independent noise in expression of individual genes but is due to fluctuating networks of regulatory genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kumar et al., 2014</a>). Such fluctuations appear to be stochastic in nature, priming cells to transit into differentiated states with a certain probability that is guided by extrinsic signals."

Progenitor cells showed a spike in Yan-YFP noise as they began to induce Yan-YFP expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The noise spike was short-lived (approximately 17\u2009hr), and noise thereafter returned to a basal level with secondary minor spikes.

Transgene recombineering was used to insert YFP into a genomic rescue fragment of the <i>yan</i> gene, which fully replaced endogenous <i>yan</i>. Yan-YFP protein was quantified in thousands of individual cells by fluorescence confocal microscopy and automated cell segmentation analysis. Based on the unique features of <i>Drosophila</i> eye development, every analyzed cell was assigned an age, and composites of cells across a time-spectrum of ages were derived. This allowed us to reconstruct the temporal dynamics of Yan protein expression in cells as they transited from one state to another or were maintained in a given state. The fact that both Yan concentration and noise were easily measured using our approach indicates that it provides a powerful method for studying how other molecular determinants regulate cell states."

If cells transit towards differentiation, then the fall in Yan is accelerated but the fundamental biphasic profile is preserved. This monostable-like behavior is not like a behavior where progenitor cells exist in a high Yan stable-state and switch to a low Yan stable-state when they transit towards differentiation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Other lines of evidence also point away from a bistable switch mechanism. Yan reaches its basal steady state many hours after cells have adopted their differentiated photoreceptor state and are executing specialized gene expression programs. Thus, Yan levels are variable at the time when cells actually become differentiated."

This conclusion is bolstered by experiments in which <i>yan</i> gene dosage affects absolute Yan levels but not cell behavior. Several mechanisms could explain how Yan regulates cells in a concentration-independent manner. First, total Yan might vary but a specific modified form of Yan might remain constant. For example, MAPK phosphorylation of Yan could operate under Michaelis-Menten saturation to generate constant levels of phospho-Yan that depend upon MAPK activity. Second, Yan\u2019s transcriptional activities might be independent of Yan concentration due to limiting levels of other transcription factors such as Lozenge, Glass, and Sine Oculis, which are known to act combinatorially with Yan to regulate gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib12\">Flores et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hayashi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Xu et al., 2000</a>). Third, cells might sense relative changes in Yan, and respond to a constant fold-change in Yan levels using integral negative feedback or incoherent feedforward loops (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohen-Saidon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Goentoro and Kirschner, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Goentoro et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wartlick et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, Yan is predicted to function in an incoherent feedforward loop with Pnt. Pnt directly activates transcription of target genes such as <i>pros</i> and <i>mir-7</i>, but it also activates expression of Yan (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), which in turn, directly represses transcription of <i>pros</i> and <i>mir-7</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Xu et al., 2000</a>)."

Conditions that repress variability keep these cells trapped in an undifferentiated state (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kumar et al., 2014</a>). Noisy expression is thought to place cells into a transition state where a sub-population of cells at any given time express a particular combination of factors that spontaneously trigger differentiation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Martinez Arias and Brickman, 2011</a>). Such a fluctuating transition state renders the probability of cell differentiation to be greater than zero, and thus provides cells with the ability to respond to extrinsic signals."

As progenitor cells transit to differentiated states, there is a sharp spike in Yan expression noise that coincides with the early stages of the transition. By analogy to the situation in embryonic stem cells, the spike in Yan noise could reflect the existence of a metastable intermediate state between the undifferentiated and differentiated states (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>)."

A prediction of this hypothesis is that differentiation signals would act downstream of noise elevation and might even be important for noise reduction once cells enter an irreversible differentiated state. Indeed, EGFR/Ras signaling is not required for elevation of Yan noise but rather is important in promoting the rapid reduction of noise back to its baseline level after differentiation. In the absence of signaling, the cell may remain trapped in the intermediate (undifferentiated) state."

Do other determinants such as Pnt similarly fluctuate? Do individual cells fluctuate over time or does this represent a population of cells that adopt stable microstates? And finally, there is the question of the noise spike in progenitor cells at the time of R8 formation. Does this represent another transition state that early progenitor cells enter before moving into a different progenitor state? One intriguing possibility is that it represents the transition from G1-arrest to synchronized cell division that progenitor cells undergo in the second mitotic wave immediately posterior to the furrow (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wolff and Ready, 1993</a>). Loss-of-function studies have suggested that Yan prevents progenitors from undergoing multiple rounds of cell division rather than again arresting at G1 phase after one round of division (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rogge et al., 1995</a>). Further studies should help elucidate the causes and functions of this and the other noise peaks."

The recombineered <i>Yan-YFP</i> BAC transgene was previously described (<a href=\"#bib55\">Webber et al., 2013</a>). It was inserted into the attP2 (3L) and attP16 (2R) sites in the genome. 2 x <i>Yan-YFP</i> animals used for most experiments were null for endogenous <i>yan</i> and carried a single copy of the <i>His2Av-mRFP</i> transgene (<i>yan<sup>ER443</sup>/yan<sup>E884</sup>; Yan-YFP/Yan-YFP, His2Av-mRFP</i>). EGFR activity was conditionally reduced by placing <i>Egfr<sup>f24</sup></i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clifford and Schupbach, 1989</a>) <i>in trans</i> to the ts mutant <i>Egfr<sup>tsla</sup></i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kumar et al., 1998</a>). Flies were raised at the permissive temperature (18\u00b0C) and shifted to a semi-restrictive temperature (26.5\u00b0C) as third instar larvae for 18-20h. At this temperature, developing eye cells had compromised EGFR activity since animals that were transferred back to the permissive temperature and allowed to eclose had rough eyes. In <i>EGFR<sup>ts</sup></i> eye discs, there were signs of some cells undergoing apoptosis - a significant reduction of nuclear diameter, a strong Yan-YFP brightness, and anomalous nuclear position along the apical-basal axis. Apoptosis was more prevalent in discs from animals treated at temperatures greater than 26.5\u00b0C. Therefore, we chose this temperature for EGFR activity reduction so as to minimize apoptosis but still achieve effects on cell differentiation. We only included in our analysis cells corresponding to classical anatomical positions and apical basal migration patterns. Ras activation was achieved using a transgene expressing a <i>Ras1<sup>V12</sup></i> mutant. Expression was under the control of the 3xsev enhancer and promoter (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fortini et al., 1992</a>).

Segmentation of nuclei in each optical section image was performed with a custom-built Matlab program (<a href=\"#bib43\">Qi et al., 2013</a>). A detailed description of the algorithm, coding, and analysis will be published separately. We briefly describe it as follows. First, graph-cut estimates the mean overall signal and partitions the image into background and foreground, resulting in nuclear pixels clustering in the foreground. Such clusters are then analyzed with a mean-shift algorithm, which further partitions the objects into smaller pixel clusters in a locally optimized manner. Due to the tight packing of eye disc nuclei, many such segmented objects contain multiple nuclei whose fluorescence signals partially overlap. Thus, objects are then subjected to concavity-convexity analysis. According to this analysis a cluster of cells is split into multiple cells, based on a threshold that quantifies the degree of concavity of the cluster (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The Matlab implementation of this algorithm contains 5 parameters."

Using a Delaunay triangulation, we determined the network of R8 cells within each sample (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). In this network, nodes are R8 nuclei centroids and links are the first R8 neighbors of each R8 cell nucleus found in the triangulation. The Delauney triangulation for a set P of points in a plane is a triangulation DT(P) in which no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P), and in which the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation is maximized. As a result, Delauney triangulations tend to avoid skinny triangles, thus providing a proper estimation of the grid of nearest neighbors for each R8 neuron in the set. We enumerated all the R8 neighbors for each R8 cell found in the triangulation, and for each R8 cell, we selected neighbors whose links to the R8 cell were oriented between 30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 away from the anterior-posterior axis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1J</a>). We reasoned that these neighbors would correspond to R8 cells found within adjacent columns. The pairing process was repeated for every R8 cell in the network. The anterior-most column of R8 cells did not pair with more anterior cells since there were none. For each R8 pair, we decomposed the diagonal distance separating the two R8 cells using <i>Pythagoras</i>. We used the x-component of the distance separating the two R8 cells as the distance traveled by the furrow between those two adjacent columns. We then computed the average distance (<i>\u03bc</i>) in pixels that the MF travels between adjacent columns as"

Although we present the results of pooled samples and their analyses, these findings do not depend on sample alignment, and are reproducibly observable in individual samples when analyzed separately.

We first detrended R2/R5 Yan-YFP levels according to their positions in X to avoid spurious spatial correlations with developmental time. Specifically, we performed standard LOESS detrending in X on log-transformed R2/R5 Yan-YFP levels using local second-degree polynomials and tri-cubic weighted neighborhoods with a smoothing parameter of 0.5. The resulting residual log-transformed R2/R5 Yan-YFP levels were distributed with approximately constant variance. We separately calculated the physical distance from the center of each R2 and R5 nucleus to the center of its nearest R8 nucleus. Detrending and distance calculations were performed independently for each measured eye disc (4 WT and 4 <i>EGFR<sup>ts</sup></i> replicates) and then pooled for correlation calculations. For a series of windows along the X-axis that each span 12.5\u2009hr of developmental time, we selected R2 or R5 cells within those windows and calculated the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient from their residual log-transformed Yan-YFP levels and distances to the nearest R8. The p-value associated with each window is calculated from the corresponding t-test assuming an uncorrelated bivariate normal distribution for sample points. The explained variance reported for each window is derived from the R<sup>2</sup> value of a standard linear fit. Correlation analysis was performed using the R statistical software package (v3.1.2)."

Although the authors cannot perform live imaging with eye discs they use the stereotypic sequence of photoreceptor and cone cell differentiation to gain temporal information on how Yan expression changes during the transition from multipotency to the differentiated state. In variance to earlier reports the authors do not find evidence for a bistable switch with high levels of Yan expression in progenitors and low levels in differentiated cells. They rather observe a monostable concentration curve with interesting stochastic properties. The curve shows highest fluctuations in concentration when the cells begin to differentiate. Fluctuation decrease when the differentiated state is reached. Changing overall Yan concentrations (by increasing the copy number of the construct) does not affect the dynamics and noisiness and has no impact on fate decisions. Thus, Yan does not act as a concentration-dependent (morphogen-type) transcription factor. The authors suggest that rather the noisiness itself might play a functional role: high levels of noise might be functionally relevant for the transition from multi- to restricted potency. Genetic manipulations are presented which support this view. Reduction of EGF signaling delays the reduction of noise during differentiation and constitutive EGF activation (activated Ras) reduces noise even in progenitors. Both manipulations influence fate decisions."
