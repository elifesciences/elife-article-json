The roundworms were genetically engineered to produce a fluorescent protein that indicates when a particular gene needed to make proteasomes is active. Lehrbach and Ruvkun identified some roundworms with mutations that cause the levels of fluorescence to be lower, indicating that SKN-1 was less active in these animals. Further experiments showed that some of these mutations are in genes that encode enzymes called DDI-1 and PNG-1. DDI-1 is able to cut certain proteins, while PNG-1 can remove sugars that are attached to proteins. Therefore, it is likely that these enzymes directly interact with SKN-1 and alter it to activate the genes that produce the proteasome."

In mammalian cells members of the Cap\u2019 n\u2019 Collar basic leucine zipper (CnC-bZip) family of stress responsive transcription factors mediate this transcriptional response. Two CnC-bZip franscription factors, Nrf1/NFE2L1 and Nrf2, have similar DNA-binding domains and may regulate an overlapping set of downstream targets. However, only Nrf1 is required for upregulation of proteasome subunits following proteasome disruption, whereas Nrf2 may activate proteasome expression under other circumstances (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arlt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Steffen et al., 2010</a>). The events leading to Nrf1 activation in response to proteasome disruption are complex. In vitro analyses in human and mouse cells indicate that Nrf1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane associated glycoprotein that is constitutively targeted for proteasomal degradation by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Upon proteasome inhibition Nrf1 is stabilized, undergoes deglycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, and localizes to the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib45\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sha and Goldberg, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang and Hayes, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2014</a>).

We find that an ER-associated isoform of SKN-1 (SKN-1A), is essential for this response. Our genetic data show that the ER-association of this transcription factor normally targets it for poteasomal degradation via ERAD, but is also required for its correct post-translational processing and activation during proteasome dysfunction. After ER-trafficking, our data argues that the PNG-1 peptide N-glycanase removes glycosylation modifications that occur in the ER, and then the DDI-1 aspartic protease cleaves SKN-1A. Each of these steps in SKN-1A processing is essential for the normal response to proteasomal dysfunction. This pathway is essential for compensation of proteasome function under conditions that partially disrupt the proteasome; when compensation is disabled, mild inhibition of the proteasome causes lethal arrest of development. Thus we reveal a vital mechanism of proteasome surveillance and homeostasis in animals."

We generated a chromosomally integrated transcriptional reporter in which the <i>rpt-3</i> promoter drives expression of GFP (<i>rpt-3::gfp</i>). This reporter gene is upregulated in response to drugs such as bortezomib or mutations that cause proteasome dysfunction. To identify the genetic pathways that sense proteasome dysfunction and trigger the activation of SKN-1, we took advantage of a regulatory allele affecting the <i>pbs-5</i> locus. <i>pbs-5</i> encodes the <i>C. elegans</i> ortholog of the beta 5 subunit of the 20S proteasome. The <i>pbs-5(mg502</i>) mutation causes constitutive <i>skn-1</i>-dependent activation of <i>rpt-3::gfp</i> expression, but does not otherwise alter fertility or viability (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Following EMS mutagenesis, we isolated a collection of recessive mutations that suppress the activation of <i>rpt-3::gfp</i> caused by <i>pbs-5(mg502</i>), and identified the causative mutations by whole genome sequencing (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The collection includes multiple alleles of genes encoding factors required for ERAD. In ERAD, misfolded glycoproteins are retrotranslocated from the ER lumen to the cytoplasm, where they are degraded by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib50\">Smith et al., 2011</a>). We isolated 3 alleles of <i>sel-1</i>, a gene that encodes the <i>C. elegans</i> orthologue of HRD3/SEL1. HRD3/SEL1 localizes to the ER membrane and recognizes ERAD substrates in the ER (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Denic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gauss et al., 2006</a>), and a single allele of <i>sel-9</i>, which encodes the <i>C. elegans</i> orthologue of TMED2/EMP24, which is also ER-localized and implicated in ER quality control (<a href=\"#bib12\">Copic et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wen and Greenwald, 1999</a>). We also found mutations in <i>png-1</i>, which encodes the <i>C. elegans</i> orthologue of PNG1/NGLY1. After ERAD substrates have been retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm, PNG1/NGLY1 removes N-linked glycans to allow their degradation by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2016</a>). Most strikingly, we isolated six alleles of <i>C01G5.6</i> (hereafter <i>ddi-1</i>), which encodes the <i>C. elegans</i> orthologue of DDI1 (DNA damage inducible 1). DDI-1 is an aspartic protease, highly conserved throughout eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sirkis et al., 2006</a>). DD1\u2019s function is poorly understood, but it has been implicated in regulation of proteasome function and protein secretion (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kaplun et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">White et al., 2011</a>)."

We analyzed independently derived alleles of <i>png-1</i> and <i>ddi-1</i>, indicating that hypersensitivity to proteasome inhibition is unlikely to be a consequence of linked background mutations. <i>png-1</i> animals consistently showed the most severe defect, and were unable to grow in the presence of very low concentrations of bortezomib. Consistent with their drug sensitivity, mild disruption of proteasome function by RNAi-mediated depletion of the non-essential proteasome subunit RPN-10 causes a synthetic larval lethal phenotype in animals mutant for <i>png-1</i>. The bortezomib sensitivity of <i>ddi-1; sel-11</i> double mutants was not enhanced compared to that of <i>ddi-1</i> single mutants, suggesting that <i>ddi-1</i> and ERAD factors act in the same genetic pathway. We conclude that ERAD and DDI-1 are required for transcriptional upregulation of proteasome subunits and survival during proteasome dysfunction. Given the defective activation of <i>rpt-3::gfp</i>, a direct target of SKN-1, it is likely that upon proteasome disruption, these factors are required to activate SKN-1."

Homozygous <i>skn-1a</i> mutant animals are viable, and under standard conditions show a growth rate and fertility indistinguishable from the wild type. However, <i>skn-1a</i> mutant animals fail to activate rpt<i>-3::gfp</i> in the <i>pbs-5(mg502</i>) mutant background, or upon RNAi of essential proteasome subunit genes, or exposure to bortezomib (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c,d</a>, data not shown). We note that in these experiments <i>skn-1a</i> mutants failed to activate <i>rpt-3::gfp</i> in all tissues, including the intestine, where SKN-1C is expressed. Consistent with the failure to upregulate <i>rpt-3::gfp, skn-1a</i> mutants show larval lethality when proteasome dysfunction is induced by <i>rpn-10(RNAi</i>) or treatment with a low dose of bortezomib (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e,h</a>). These <i>skn-1a</i> mutations specifically affect SKN-1A, but leave SKN-1B and SKN-1C unaltered, indicating that SKN-1A is essential for normal responses to proteasome disruption and in the absence of SKN-1A, the other isoforms are not sufficient.\u00a0A number of stimuli that trigger stabilization and nuclear accumulation of a transgenic SKN-1C::GFP fusion protein are known, but relatively little is known about whether these stimuli also affect SKN-1A (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blackwell et al., 2015</a>). We used miniMos transgenesis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fr\u00f8kj\u00e6r-Jensen et al., 2014</a>) to generate genomically integrated single-copy transgenes that expresses C-terminally GFP-tagged full length SKN-1A (SKN-1A::GFP), and a second C-terminally GFP tagged truncated SKN-1A that lacks the DNA binding domain (SKN-1A[\u2206DBD]::GFP). When driven by the ubiquitously active <i>rpl-28</i> promoter, we did not observe accumulation of SKN-1A::GFP or SKN-1A[\u2206DBD]::GFP, consistent with constitutive degradation of these fusion proteins. Upon disruption of proteasome function, we observed stabilization and nuclear localization of SKN-1A::GFP and SKN-1A[\u2206DBD]::GFP in many tissues (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). For unknown reasons, the SKN-1A[\u2206DBD]::GFP transgene accumulated to higher levels than the full length transgene (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). We generated similar transgenes to express tagged full length and truncated SKN-1C, but did not observe any effect of proteasome disruption (data not shown).

In the ER, SKN-1A is subject to glycosylation, and possibly other post-translational modifications. ERAD-dependent release of SKN-1A from the ER targets SKN-1A for proteasome-mediated degradation. When the proteasome is functional (shown on the left half of the model), SKN-1A is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Under these conditions, the DDI-1 protease is expressed at low levels and localizes largely to the cytoplasm. During proteasome dysfunction (shown on the right half of the model), SKN-1A is not efficiently degraded. Stabilized SKN-1A is deglycosylated by PNG-1 (this deglycosylation might take place in the nucleus or cytoplasm) and localizes to the nucleus. Proteasome dysfunction also leads to increased expression and nuclear localization of DDI-1 (this is in part due to regulation of <i>ddi-1</i> transcription by SKN-1A, but likely involves additional SKN-1A-independent mechanisms). Once in the nucleus, SKN-1A is cleaved by DDI-1 to produce the active truncated form of SKN-1A, allowing upregulation of proteasome subunits and other downstream genes. Cleavage of SKN-1A is disrupted by mutations that affect ERAD, or if SKN-1A lacks its transmembrane domain, suggesting that DDI-1-dependent cleavage occurs downstream of ER-trafficking and may require post-translational modifications to SKN-1A acquired during this process."

Mutations affecting ERAD genes <i>sel-1</i>/SEL1/HRD3 and <i>sel-11</i>/HRD1, stabilize SKN-1A, but also disrupt localization of SKN-1A following proteasome disruption, due to a failure to efficiently release SKN-1A from the ER.

These similarities suggest that SKN-1A activity may be completely abolished in the absence of PNG-1; likely as a result of failure to deglycosylate SKN-1A following its retrotranslocation from the ER, although we cannot rule out the possibility that deglycosylation of other proteins contributes indirectly to SKN-1A function. Surprisingly, we were unable to generate <i>png-1; skn-1a</i> double mutants, apparently due to lethality of double mutant embryos (NL unpublished).

Failure to deglycosylate Nrf1, and consequent defects in proteasome homeostasis, likely contributes to the symptoms associated with NGLY1 deficiency.

DDI-1-dependent cleavage therefore activates SKN-1A by some other mechanism(s) downstream of ER release. Cleavage of SKN-1A may be required to remove domains in the N-terminus that interfere with its normal function in the nucleus.

In many cases, the causative alleles were strongly suggested by the identification of multiple independent alleles for a given gene. Even for those genes only identified by a single allele, the strong functional connection with other independently mutated genes suggests that they are causative (e.g. isolation of multiple alleles of the <i>sel</i> gene class). We also obtained genetic linkage data supporting these assignments for most alleles. For most of the mutants considered, deep sequencing was performed using a DNA from a pool of 20\u201350 mutant F2s generated by outcrossing the original mutant strain to the parental (non-mutagenised) background, which allowed us to use Cloudmap variant discovery mapping to identify the genetic linkage of the causative allele, or linkage was confirmed by testing linkage in crosses with strains carrying precisely mapped miniMos insertions. For <i>ddi-1</i> and <i>png-1</i>, we confirmed that disruption by an independent means (with an independently derived allele) has the same effect on <i>rpt-3::gfp</i> expression as the EMS-induced mutation."

It was shown over 10 years ago that inhibition of the proteasome in mammalian cells results in transcriptional induction of genes that encode proteasome subunits. Six years ago, the Deshaies group showed that this induction requires Nrf1 in mouse cells, and this was followed by a report from the Kruger group that the Nrf1 ortholog TCF11 mediates the response in human cells. They also showed that TCF11 is a substrate for the ERAD pathway. More recently, the Deshaies group reported the surprising observation that most of Nrf1 enters the ER lumen during its biogenesis, but is quickly retrotranslocated to the cytosol in p97-dependent manner, where it is clipped on the C-terminal side of tryptophan-103. This retrotranslocation and clipping were shown to be essential for Nrf1 activation. However, the protease was not identified, although a subsequent report from Fred Goldberg's group claimed that Nrf1 processing is carried out by partially inhibited proteasomes."

They also identify ERAD genes including PNG-1, which is the <i>C. elegans</i> ortholog of the protein N-glycosidase enzyme NGLY1 that cleaves asparagine-linked oligosaccharides from retrotranslocated proteins. Overall, this is a compelling manuscript that makes an important finding that is likely to have broad ramifications not only for Nrf1 and protein homeostasis, but also for aging, neurodegeneration, and possibly cancer therapy.

This work gives key insight into how this might occur via ERAD and proteolytic regulation, providing a plausible link of NRF1 activation with the ER stress response and ERAD. The authors focus on the role of DDI-1 predominately because it is not well studied, thereby lending new insight. Among other things, this study raises the question of how mechanistically ERAD mobilizes SKN-1A from the ER, but perhaps this would be the subject of a whole other study."

Indeed, as SKN-1A is the only SKN-1 isoform with a transmembrane domain it is unlikely that ERAD and DDI-1 play a role in SKN-1C activation. This may be analogous to the different mechanisms regulating Nrf1 and Nrf2 in mammals.
