This has been controversially interpreted as evidence that speech sounds are processed as articulatory gestures. However, it is unclear what information is actually encoded by such neural activity. We used high-density direct human cortical recordings while participants spoke and listened to speech sounds. Motor cortex neural patterns during listening were substantially different than during articulation of the same sounds. During listening, we observed neural activity in the superior and inferior regions of ventral motor cortex. During speaking, responses were distributed throughout somatotopic representations of speech articulators in motor cortex. The structure of responses in motor cortex during listening was organized along acoustic features similar to auditory cortex, rather than along articulatory features as during speaking. Motor cortex does not contain articulatory representations of perceived actions in speech, but rather, represents auditory vocal information."

This has been controversially interpreted as evidence that speech sounds are processed as articulatory gestures. However, it is unclear what information is actually encoded by such neural activity. We used high-density direct human cortical recordings while participants spoke and listened to speech sounds. Motor cortex neural patterns during listening were substantially different than during articulation of the same sounds. During listening, we observed neural activity in the superior and inferior regions of ventral motor cortex. During speaking, responses were distributed throughout somatotopic representations of speech articulators in motor cortex. The structure of responses in motor cortex during listening was organized along acoustic features similar to auditory cortex, rather than along articulatory features as during speaking. Motor cortex does not contain articulatory representations of perceived actions in speech, but rather, represents auditory vocal information."

This revealed that speaking activates many different areas of motor cortex. However, listening to the same sounds activates only a small subset of these areas. Contrary to what was thought, brain activity patterns in motor cortex during listening do not match those during speaking. Instead, they depend on the properties of the sounds. Thus, sounds that have similar acoustic properties but which require different movements to produce them, such as \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019, activate the motor cortex in similar ways during listening, but not during speaking."

However, an accumulating number of studies has revealed their roles in action and perception to be highly integrated\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Pulverm\u00fcller and Fadiga, 2010</a>). For example, a number of studies have demonstrated that both sensory and motor cortices are engaged during perception\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Gallese et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wilson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tkach et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cogan et al., 2014</a>).

The motor theory is a venerable and well-differentiated exemplar of a set of speech perception theories that we could call 'production-referencing' theories. Unlike motor theory, more modern production referencing theories do not assume that sensorimotor circuits are necessarily referenced in order for speech to be recognized, but they allow for motor involvement in perception in certain phonetic modes. For example, <a href=\"#bib31\">Lindblom, 1996</a> suggested that a direct link between spectrotemporal analysis and word recognition is the normal mode of speech perception (the 'what' mode of perception), but in some cases listeners do use a route through sensorimotor circuits (the 'how' mode of perception) if, for example, the listener is attempting to imitate a new sound\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Lindblom, 1996</a>)."

Determining what phonetic properties are encoded in the motor cortex has significant implications for elucidating the role it may play in speech perception. To address this, we recorded direct neural activity from the peri-Sylvian speech cortex in nine human participants undergoing clinical monitoring for epilepsy surgery. This includes but is not limited to two relevant areas comprising the supra-Sylvian ventral half of the lateral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) for the motor control of articulation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib36\">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</a>) and the infra-Sylvian superior temporal gyrus (STG) for the auditory processing of speech sounds\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Ojemann et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boatman et al., 1995</a>). Since cortical processing of speech sounds is spatially discrete and temporally fast\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Formisano et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Steinschneider et al., 2011</a>), we used customized high-density electrode grids (a four-fold increase over conventional recordings)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouchard et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mesgarani et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, these recordings have simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution in order to study the detailed speech representations in the vSMC\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Crone et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Edwards et al., 2009</a>). With this approach, we seek to address unanswered questions about the representation of speech sounds in motor cortex, including how the spatiotemporal patterns compare when speaking and listening and whether auditory representations in motor cortex are organized along articulatory or acoustic dimensions."

During speaking, specific articulator representations have been identified in the somatotopically-organized vSMC\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouchard et al., 2013</a>). For example, the plosive consonants /b/, /d/, and /g/ are produced by the closure of the vocal tract at the lips, front tongue, and back tongue, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a, b</a>, see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2009for all syllable tokens)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Ladefoged and Johnson, 2010</a>). The cortical representations for these articulators are laid out along a superior-to-inferior (medial-to-lateral) sequence in the vSMC\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib36\">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</a>). We first examined average cortical activity at single electrode sites distributed along the vSMC axis for articulating individual speech sounds. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> shows single electrode activity from a single representative subject (the same from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) for speaking (blue lines) and listening (red lines) for three CV syllables, which have different place of articulation (/ba/, /da/, and /ga/). The exact location of these electrodes on the vSMC is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>. The production of labial consonants (/b/) is associated with activity in lip cortical representations as evidenced by strong responses to the bilabial /ba/ (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, electrodes 5\u20136, blue lines). These are located superior to the tongue representations associated with the /d/ and /g/ consonants, as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouchard et al., 2013</a>).

In previous studies, we demonstrated that the structure of evoked responses are primarily organized by different feature sensitivities: place of articulation in the vSMC\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouchard et al., 2013</a>), and manner of articulation in the STG\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Mesgarani et al., 2014</a>). We visualized the similarity of population activity evoked by different consonants using unsupervised multidimensional scaling (MDS), where the 2-dimensional Euclidean distances between stimuli correspond to the similarity of their neural responses. Visual inspection of MDS plots shows that, during speaking, evoked activity in vSMC clustered into place of articulation features (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>): labials (/b/, /p/), alveolars (/s/, /sh/, /t/, /d/), and velars (/g/, /k/)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). In contrast, neural responses during listening did not cluster into the same features (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). To quantify the degree to which the evoked activity clustered into place of articulation features, we used unsupervised K-means clustering to assign the neural responses to clusters (k=3), and the adjusted Rand Index (RI<sub>adj</sub>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib39\">Rand, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hubert and Arabie, 1985</a>) to measure the degree to which the neural clustering agreed with linguistically defined place of articulation consonant clusters. The RI<sub>adj</sub> quantifies the degree of agreement between two clustering patterns, where RI<sub>adj</sub> = 1\u2009denotes identical clustering patterns and RI<sub>adj</sub> = 0\u2009denotes independent clustering patterns. We found that while evoked activity during speaking clustered by place of articulation features, activity during listening did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>; see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2009for moving time window analysis). Even when the vSMC electrode subset was restricted to short-latency vSMC electrodes leading STG activity (as evidenced by a positive asymmetry index in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>), activity during listening did not cluster according to place of articulation features (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

STG has an acoustic sensory representation of speech that best discriminates speech sounds by manner of articulation features with salient acoustic differences\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Mesgarani et al., 2014</a>). Using multidimensional scaling, STG spatial patterns during listening showed clustering according to three high-order acoustic features (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>): voiced plosives (/b/, /d/, /g/), unvoiced plosives (/p/, /t/, /k/), and fricatives (/s/, /sh/)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Ladefoged and Johnson, 2010</a>). This is consistent with the relational organization derived by analysis of structure in the stimulus acoustics (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>), and the structure of STG during speaking (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3b</a>). With the same analyses, we observed that activity in motor cortex clustered into the same three acoustic features (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>, note this panel is identical to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a> simply re-colored). Unsupervised K-means clustering analysis confirmed that vSMC activity, during listening, organized into these linguistically defined acoustic feature groups, but was significantly weaker than the organization of STG (p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g</a>). Importantly, however, clustering by acoustic manner features was significantly stronger than clustering by place features in vSMC electrodes during listening (p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>). This organization suggests that motor cortex activity during speech perception reflects an acoustic sensory representation of speech in the vSMC that mirrors acoustic representations of speech in auditory cortex."

We fit spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) models for each vSMC electrode using normalized reverse correlation (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), which describes the spectrotemporal properties of speech acoustics that predict the activity of a single site in motor cortex. To compute the STRF, we calculate the correlation between the neural response at an electrode and the stimulus spectrogram at multiple time lags. The result is then normalized by the auto-correlation in the stimulus. This results in a linear filter for each electrode (the STRF), which, when convolved with the stimulus spectrogram, produces a predicted neural response to that stimulus. The prediction performance of each STRF was determined by calculating the correlation between the activity predicted by the STRF and the actual response on held out data. A fraction of vSMC sites (16/98\u2009sites total) were reasonably well-predicted with a linear STRF (r&gt;=0.10\u2009and p&lt;0.01, permutation test) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Theunissen et al., 2001</a>). STRFs with significant correlation coefficients were localized to superior and inferior vSMC (primarily precentral gyrus) in addition to STG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Still, the prediction performance of STRFs in vSMC was generally lower than that of the STG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). Furthermore, the majority of STRFs in both regions showed strong low frequency tuning (100\u2013200\u00a0Hz) properties related to voicing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), though some also showed high frequency tuning consistent with selectivity for fricatives and stop consonants by visual inspection\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Mesgarani et al., 2014</a>). We also estimated the mean cortical response at each motor site to every phoneme in English and found a diverse set of responses (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>) that were notably weaker in magnitude compared to STG responses (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Weak selectivity to phonetic features measured by the Phoneme Selectivity Index (PSI) was also observed (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Mesgarani et al., 2014</a>). These findings reveal that individual sites in motor cortex reflect sensory responses to definable spectrotemporal features speech acoustics, including voicing attributes. Presumably, this tuning gives rise to the acoustic organization found in the previous analysis of distributed spatial patterns of neural activity."

This 'integrative' view is reminiscent of linguistic production-referencing theories, including the motor theory of speech perception, which propose that motor circuits are involved in speech perception\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Liberman et al., 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liberman and Mattingly, 1985</a>). In line with these theories, human neuroimaging studies have showed mirror activity in ventral premotor cortex during listening\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib51\">Wilson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pulverm\u00fcller et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Edwards et al., 2010</a>), and modulated premotor activity in phoneme categorization tasks\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Alho et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chevillet et al., 2013</a>). Our results extend these findings by detailing the representational selectivity and encoding of vSMC in perception. Consistent with previous findings, we demonstrated local \u2018audiomotor\u2019 responses to speech sounds in vSMC. When the responses were further examined for phonetic structure, we found major motor articulatory place features, such as labial, alveolar, and velar, were not represented with single site activity or distributed spatial activity. This observation is in direct contrast with structural predictions made by the original motor theory of speech perception\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Liberman et al., 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liberman and Mattingly, 1985</a>), while confirming that motor cortex plays a role in perception\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Lindblom, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hickok and Poeppel, 2007</a>)."

The tuning properties of responsive sites in vSMC are similar to properties observed in STG during listening\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Mesgarani et al., 2014</a>) and appear to give rise to an acoustic sensory organization of speech sounds (rather than purely motor organization) in motor cortex during listening."

Our results may complement this interpretation in that the audiomotor cortex enhancement is specific to an auditory representation, without transforming information to a motor articulatory representation.

Early responses in vSMC may reflect bidirectional connections from STG\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib53\">Zatorre et al., 2007</a>), primary auditory cortex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Nelson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schneider et al., 2014</a>) or auditory thalamus\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Henschke et al., 2014</a>),\u00a0whereas later responses might reflect indirect connectivity in areas downstream from the STG\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Rauschecker and Scott, 2009</a>). Indeed, our cross-correlation analysis revealed bidirectional dynamical relationships between vSMC and STG responses, in which STG responses led vSMC responses and vice versa (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d\u2013f</a>). Still, this analysis was independent of the diverse tuning properties in the vSMC and STG electrode sets, so longer latency responses likely reflect the later responses to vowels relative to consonants. Even so, we found a wide variety of tuning and dynamical profiles in the vSMC electrodes that responded during listening. Given these proposed functional connections, activity in vSMC from speech sounds may be a consequence of sounds activating the sensory feedback circuit\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Hickok et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, evoked responses in the motor cortex during passive listening may directly reflect auditory inputs arising from aggregated activity picked up by the electrode. We believe the latter scenario to be less likely, however, given that auditory responses were observed in dorsal vSMC on electrode contacts several centimeters away from auditory inputs in the STG. In addition, the spatial spread of neural signals in the high gamma range is substantially smaller than this difference \u2013 high gamma signal correlations at &lt;2\u2009mm spacing are only around r=0.5, and at distances of 1\u2009cm reach a noise floor (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chang, 2015</a>); Muller et al, unpublished findings). Given the observed acoustic rather than place selectivity observed during listening in the vSMC, our results suggest that motor theories of speech perception may need to be revised to incorporate a novel sensorimotor representation of sound in the vSMC."

Stimuli were presented randomly, with 4\u201321\u2009repetitions of each CV syllable for 5\u2009out of the 9\u2009subjects included in all subsequent analyses, and one repetition of each CV syllable for 4\u2009subjects shown only in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. To remain alert, participants were asked to identify the syllable they heard by selecting from a multiple-choice question on a computer with their ipsilateral (left) hand. In the second task, participants spoke aloud the same CV syllables prompted by a visual cue on the laptop computer display. In the third task, participants passively listened to natural speech samples from a phonemically transcribed continuous speech corpus (TIMIT). We chose 499\u2009unique sentences from 400\u2009different male and female speakers. Each sentence was repeated two times. For the phoneme selectivity analysis, we chose a subset of TIMIT phonemes that occurred more than 30\u2009times. This resulted in an analysis of 33\u2009phonemes.

The remaining time series were then common-average referenced (CAR) and used for analyses. The CAR was taken across 16\u2009channel banks in order to remove non-neural electrical noise from shared inputs to the PZ2. We find that this method of CAR significantly reduces movement-related and other non-neural artifacts while not adversely affecting our signals of interest. The analytic amplitude of each time series was extracted using eight bandpass filters (Gaussian filters, logarithmically increasing center frequencies (70\u2013150\u00a0Hz) with semi-logarithmically increasing bandwidths) with the Hilbert transform. The high-gamma power was calculated by averaging the analytic amplitude across these eight bands, and downsampling the signal to 100\u00a0Hz.

The RI<sub>adj</sub> is frequently used in statistics for cluster validation. It measures the amount of agreement between two clustering schemes: one by a given clustering process (e.g. K-means), and the other by some external criteria, or gold-standard (e.g. place of articulation linguistic features). The RI<sub>adj</sub> takes an intuitive approach to measuring cluster similarity by counting the number of pairs of objects classified in the same cluster under both clustering schemes, and controlling for chance (hence, 'adjusted' RI). It has an expected value of 0\u2009for independent clusterings, and a maximum value of 1\u2009for identical clustering. It is defined as the following:"

This resulted in a PSI that ranges from 0\u2009to 32, where a PSI = 32\u2009is an extremely selective electrode and a PSI = 0\u2009is not selective.

To prevent overfitting, we used an L2\u2009regularization procedure in which a ridge hyperparameter and sparseness hyperparameter were calculated for each electrode's STRF (details in [<a href=\"#bib52\">Woolley et al., 2006</a>]). The ridge hyperparameter acts as a smoothing factor on the STRF, whereas the sparseness hyperparameter controls the number of non-zero weights in the STRF. These hyperparameters were optimized with a systematic hyperparameter grid search maximizing for mutual information (bits/s). With the optimized hyperparameters, we calculated the final STRF and correlation between the predicted and actual neural response using cross-validation. To do this, a STRF was derived using 9/10\u2009of the stimuli-response pairs, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (indicating the STRF goodness-of-fit) was measured by predicting the remaining one-tenth responses. This was repeated 10\u2009times with 10\u2009non-overlapping stimuli-response pair sets. The final STRF and correlation number were derived by averaging the 10\u2009STRFs and correlation coefficients."

High-density ECoG grids recorded local field potentials from the surface of motor and auditory cortices of epileptic patients who either produced CVs or passively listened to them. During speaking, evoked neural activity in ventral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) was somatotopically organized according to place of articulation whereas during listening, the organized seemed to be based on acoustic features. Both reviewers and the reviewing editor believe that the study could shed light on the important question of whether or not speech perception depends upon encoding spoken language in a motor-based neural code. The innovative experimental and analytical techniques add to our enthusiasm for the work. While the data suggest that language perception is encoded in acoustic features rather than speech-motor production features, all of us felt that there were some major issues, especially with the data analysis, that need to be addressed before the full impact of the study can be evaluated."

This in turn means limiting the analysis to those sites that are active for both vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> and vSMC<sub>listening</sub> conditions. It seems problematic to claim that activity patterns are different across conditions when those patterns are being examined in different sets of electrodes.

We do not find that the CAR reduces the high-\u03b3 power, but rather serves to remove large artifacts across wide sensory and non-sensory areas that are likely non-neural in origin. In our study, the CAR was applied across 16 channel blocks running in columns across the ECoG grid before segmenting data into speech responsive or non-responsive. Blocks of 16 channels were used because when the ECoG grids are plugged into the amplifier, the 256 channels are separated into 16 channel sets, each of which is plugged into a separate bank (<a href=\"http://www.tdt.com/files/specs/PZ2.pdf\">http://www.tdt.com/files/specs/PZ2.pdf</a>). The grids are designed such that the 16 channel sets correspond to columns on the grid \u2013 for example, channels 1\u201316 share a common plug, 17-32 share the next plug, 33-48 the next, etc. Thus, when we subtract the CAR in these 16-channel banks, it removes noise that is shared across a group of wires plugged into the same bank on the amplifier. In practice, we find that this significantly reduces the amount of 60 Hz noise and removes some artifacts due to movement, but does not adversely affect signals in the high \u03b3 band. Because of the orientation of the grids, the columns of the grid generally run ventrodorsally and include electrodes over speech-selective and non-selective areas (STG and parietal cortex, or STG and motor cortex, for example). Thus, subtracting signals shared across this wide region do not generally affect the high-\u03b3 band power in this way (that is, we do not find that strong high-\u03b3 power is weakened by the CAR). As a quantitative comparison, we compared the phoneme aligned high \u03b3 matrices with and without the CAR (shown for one subject in <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>). There is no significant difference between the high \u03b3 data with and without the CAR (Wilcoxon sign rank test, p=1)."

This comparison is shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a> and described in the figure legend. In addition, we have added the following text to the Results section: \"Importantly, however, clustering by acoustic manner features was significantly better than clustering by place features in vSMC electrodes during listening (p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>).\""

We recalculated our STRF correlations using a shuffled permutation test in which we take the predicted response from the STRF and shuffle it in time, using 500 ms chunks to maintain some of the temporal correlations inherent in the ECoG signal. We then calculate the correlation between the shuffled predictions and the actual response to get a sense of the magnitude of STRF correlations that would be observed due to chance. We perform this shuffling procedure 1000 times and calculate the p-value as the percentage of times that the shuffled time series correlations are higher than the correlations from our STRF prediction. We then perform FDR correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. As it turns out, there are many STRF correlations with r-values less than 0.1 that are still significantly higher than what would be expected due to chance. Still, we believe r = 0.1 to be a reasonable cutoff and have opted not to include more sites with lower correlation values. We have toned down the claim that these sites are \"strongly\" predicted by a linear STRF, instead writing \u201cA fraction of vSMC sites (16/98 sites total) were reasonably well-predicted with a linear STRF (r&gt;=0.10, p&lt;0.01) (Theunissen et al., 2001).\u201d Although this fraction is relatively small, these sites may encode auditory-related features that are not spectrotemporal in nature, or may respond nonlinearly to auditory features, and thus would not be captured appropriately by the STRF. In addition, more typical auditory areas including the anterior STG can show significant auditory responses that are not adequately captured by a linear STRF. The electrodes described here were located in both superior and inferior vSMC, as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, which includes STRFs from all 5 subjects plotted as a function of the rostral-caudal distance from the central sulcus and the dorsal distance from the Sylvian fissure in millimeters."
