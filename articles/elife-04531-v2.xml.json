However, selection for disfavoured CPs leads to unintended increases in CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies that also attenuate replication. We designed and phenotypically characterised mutants of the picornavirus, echovirus 7, in which these parameters were independently varied to determine which most influenced virus replication. CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies primarily influenced virus replication ability while no fitness differences were observed between mutants with different CP usage where dinucleotide frequencies were kept constant. Contrastingly, translation efficiency was unaffected by either CP usage or dinucleotide frequencies. This mechanistic insight is critical for future rational design of live virus vaccines and their safety evaluation; attenuation is mediated through enhanced innate immune responses to viruses with elevated CpG/UpA dinucleotide frequencies rather the viruses themselves being intrinsically defective."

However, selection for disfavoured CPs leads to unintended increases in CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies that also attenuate replication. We designed and phenotypically characterised mutants of the picornavirus, echovirus 7, in which these parameters were independently varied to determine which most influenced virus replication. CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies primarily influenced virus replication ability while no fitness differences were observed between mutants with different CP usage where dinucleotide frequencies were kept constant. Contrastingly, translation efficiency was unaffected by either CP usage or dinucleotide frequencies. This mechanistic insight is critical for future rational design of live virus vaccines and their safety evaluation; attenuation is mediated through enhanced innate immune responses to viruses with elevated CpG/UpA dinucleotide frequencies rather the viruses themselves being intrinsically defective."

This procedure potentially provides the means to produce a new generation of safer, non-reverting, live attenuated vaccines. Classically, virus genomes have been empirically attenuated by serial passage in tissue-culture leading to the accumulation of mutations. This lengthy, stochastic process produced attenuated virus vaccine strains which have produced major effects on human (eg., poliovirus\u2014Sabin vaccines) and animal health (eg., eradication of Rinderpest using the Plowright vaccine). However, reversion to virulence by back-mutation of characteristically a small number of key, attenuating, mutations is a well-known problem. Novel strategies by which synonymous coding changes are introduced to modify codon usage (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mueller et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Martrus et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Le Nouen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ni et al., 2014</a>) have the advantage that the resulting virus attenuation is dependent on a large number of mutations each of which only slightly reduce replicative fitness, but taken together produce significant attenuation with greatly enhanced genetic stability."

These CP de-optimised sequences were inserted into an infectious cDNA clone of poliovirus. Virus generated from these mutants showed a remarkably attenuated replication phenotype attributed by the authors to impaired translation efficiency. Codon pair de-optimisation (CPD) has since been developed as a strategy for the production of a wide range of other live attenuated virus vaccines including influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and respiratory syncytial virus (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mueller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Martrus et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Le Nouen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ni et al., 2014</a>)."

We and others (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burns et al., 2009</a>) have speculated that effects of CpG/UpA frequencies on virus replication may indeed account for, at least in part, the attenuating effect of selecting disfavoured codon pairs in CPD mutant of poliovirus and other candidate attenuated vaccines. Supporting this conjecture, regression analysis of the effects of numerous compositional variables in a range of codon- and codon pair deoptimised mutants on poliovirus replication demonstrated the primary effect of CpG and UpA frequencies on replication ability rather than alterations in codon or codon pair usage (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burns et al., 2009</a>)."

The findings demonstrate the primary influence of CpG and UpA frequencies on virus replication that was independent of codon pair usage and translation efficiency."

We analysed these parameters in coding regions of a curated dataset of over 35,170 human mRNA sequences. The representation of each of the 3904 codon pairs found in coding sequences (ie., 61 \u00d7 64) was calculated, taking into account both the nucleotide composition of the sequences and the amino acid usage as previously described (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gutman and Hatfield, 1989</a>). Relative under- and over-representation of each was indicated in a heat map, with values ranging from \u22120.222 to +0.271 (mean 0.072). Values were plotted on x- and y-axes using values that reflected base identities at each of six positions in the codon pair (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Most of the 256 CPs with CpG at the 3\u20131 position (sixth main column) were markedly under-represented. There was further influence of codon pair position 6 (CP score was more suppressed if A or U) but with generally minimal and inconsistent influences of nucleotide identities at other codon positions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bennetzen and Hall, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Buchan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Atkinson et al., 2014</a>). In the overall distribution of human codon pair representations, codon pairs containing CpG across the codon boundary distributed towards the negative tail of the distribution of CP score (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and accounted for almost all those with scores below \u22121.25."

On the one hand, it could be hypothesised that the suppression of CpG and UpA at position 3\u20131 in mammalian codon pairs was a simple consequence of avoiding disfavoured codon pairs. Conversely, it could be conceptualised that codon pair choice is driven in part through avoidance of specific dinucleotides. To resolve this functionally, we compared replication dynamics and relative fitness of native E7 with a series of novel mutants of E7 in which dinucleotide frequencies and CP usage were independently manipulated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). To achieve this, a mutational program was developed (Sequence Mutate in the SSE package (<a href=\"#bib30\">Simmonds, 2012</a>) that allowed synonymous changes to be introduced into a coding sequence to achieve a pre-specified CP score target while under constraints such as retaining CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies and mononucleotide composition."

The three mutants provided the opportunity to investigate effects of dinucleotide frequency differences of viral fitness without the compounding effect of CP bias.

In the examples of competition assays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), Max-U showed similar fitness to WT but a greater population representation at passage 10. cu|cu completely out-competed Max-U by passage 10 while in the final example, WT and Min-E showed equal fitness at passage 5 and at passage 10 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). A total of 12 pairwise comparisons were made and outcomes in terms of population representation recorded at passage 10 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; see Key). The results are internally consistent and with their replication kinetics (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and indicate the following fitness ranking:"

Viral RNA transcripts from E7 WT and mutant cDNA clones were used to program rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine. Electrophoresis of reactions after 3 hr showed translation of several bands representing cleaved and partially cleaved E7 proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Translation efficiencies of each of the mutant E7 transcripts were comparable to WT RNA; what variability there was between mutants (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) did not correlate with replication fitness (<i>R</i> = \u22120.075; p &gt; 0.5; <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>).

The fitness ranking derived from competition assays (cu|cu &gt; Max &gt; (WT = P|P = Min-E) &gt; Min-U &gt; Min-H) demonstrated that it was dinucleotide frequencies that significantly influenced fitness while differences in CP usage showed no detectable phenotypic effect. Moreover, if CPD were to influence virus replication then its effect would be manifested through changes in translation rate; however, no measurable differences in translation efficiency were detected between WT and CP-optimised (Max) or de-optimised (Min) template RNA sequences. These findings are broadly consistent with results of previous translation assays of poliovirus mutants differing in CP choice in which relatively small differences in translation of PV-Min, WT and PV-Max mutants were clearly incompatible with the marked differences in their replicative ability (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coleman et al., 2008</a>)."

Indeed, where specifically investigated, the opposite was observed. mRNA templates containing disfavoured codon pairs in <i>E. coli</i> were translated faster than those containing over-represented CPs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Irwin et al., 1995</a>). The 16 codon pairs identified as most retarding translation of the <i>E. coli</i> his operon leader peptide gene has codon pair scores ranging from \u22120.94 to +0.54 and distributed around the centre of the distribution of codon pair scores (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014Figure Supplement 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chevance et al., 2014</a>).

CP frequencies must therefore be substantially determined by mutational events operating on DNA such as methylation and specific context-dependent errors during genome replication instead of any kind of optimisation or regulation of translation. The consistent under-representation of codon pairs with CpG in the 3\u20131 position (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Buchan et al., 2006</a>) in mammalian genomes indeed likely originates from DNA methylation-induced mutations in the nucleus.

The proposed mechanism in which alterations in CP bias alter translation efficiency and it is this that inhibits virus replication introduces a conceptual model in which it is the virus that is intrinsically defective. With the large number of mutations required for reversion, such viruses should be stably attenuated in whatever context they are used. However, as we have now shown, the replication defect of CPD viruses is actually mediated through alterations in dinucleotide frequencies in the genome that influence their recognition by the cell. In this alternative paradigm, viruses with elevated frequencies of CpG and UpA are not intrinsically defective but they are more readily recognised by the cell and prevented from initiating replication. Their attenuation is therefore dependent on the efficacy of the host innate immune response."

In that study, we additionally demonstrated that it was additionally not the result of differences between high and low CpG/UpA viruses in their sensitivity to the cellular interferon response. We did observe, however, that the attenuated phenotype of high mutants could be entirely reversed by the kinase inhibitor, C16, a finding that suggests that recognition may occur through an as yet uncharacterised PKR-related component of the stress response pathway in the cell."

Although uncharacterised mechanistically, there is clearly a potential danger that pathways that restrict the replication of high CpG/UpA RNA viruses may be similarly variable in the efficacy in humans and in veterinary species with different genetic backgrounds. The attenuation of live vaccines and safety margins established for their large scale use may be similarly variable; investigation of population differences in innate cellular responses to viruses of different dinucleotide compositions is essential in the evaluation of the safety of this new generation of high CpG/UpA live attenuated vaccines."

They do this via a systematic analysis of the attenuating effects of altering 'codon-pair bias' in previous papers and by carefully design experiments of their own, which include documentation that the attenuation does not occur by reducing translational efficiency, but by reducing the infectivity of the resulting virions."

They found that this was the case, but careful mutagenesis revealed that it was, in fact, the increase in CpG and UpA nucleotides in the RNA that accounted for the attenuation. They showed that this effect was not due to translational efficiency and was manifested as the increased particle-to-PFU ratio of the resulting viruses. They reflected that bias against CpG and UpA codons might be the reason, in fact, that codons that contain them, and codon pairs that create them, are rare to begin with."

Thus, the observed CPB in poliovirus and in humans and higher eukaryotes may be driven primarily by CpG and UpA dinucleotide suppression. In this context, it is notable that in cassette C of the construct with the lowest fitness, ABc<sub>12</sub>, within-codon CpG and UpA frequencies were maximized but the CPB score was similar to those of higher-fitness constructs, including ABC.\u201d Thus, like the current manuscript, they re-analyzed the data of Coleman et al., and found it to be completely explicable in terms of CpG and UpA dinucleotides."

In the last years synthetic viruses have been generated with alternative codon distributions that show attenuated replication. However these constructs change other variables (nucleotide or dinucleotide composition) in addition to the codon distribution and it is unclear what of those changes affects replication. The authors address this issue by generating mutants of the echovirus 7 in which CpG and UpA dinucleotides were varied independent of the codon distribution. The results clearly showed that the main factor dominating replication was dinucleotide content, and that translation efficiency was unaffected by the two variables. The authors then argue that attenuation is mediated through innate immune response to viruses with high CpG/UpA content."

Their conclusions are supported by the available results, and I think this study represents an important contribution to the field because it seems to address a molecular mechanism for virus genome nucleotide composition bias.

I think that it will be a lot more powerful to use digital PCR to precisely quantify the ratio between virus genomes in the given competition assay. This will provide parameters that can then be fit in a simple mathematical model to determine with more accuracy the correlation between DN or CP and fitness, which at this point seems a bit circumstantial."

However, in the current study, outcomes were either elimination of one or other of the competing viruses or a draw. These results are readily visualised as presented, and we believe the investigation does not need more precise quantitation as suggested by the reviewer."
