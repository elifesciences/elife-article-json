However, the necessary calculations come at large computational costs, which has introduced a bottleneck that is currently limiting throughput and the development of new methods. Here, we present an implementation of the RELION image processing software that uses graphics processors (GPUs) to address the most computationally intensive steps of its cryo-EM structure determination workflow. Both image classification and high-resolution refinement have been accelerated more than an order-of-magnitude, and template-based particle selection has been accelerated well over two orders-of-magnitude on desktop hardware. Memory requirements on GPUs have been reduced to fit widely available hardware, and we show that the use of single precision arithmetic does not adversely affect results. This enables high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in a matter of days on a single workstation."

However, the necessary calculations come at large computational costs, which has introduced a bottleneck that is currently limiting throughput and the development of new methods. Here, we present an implementation of the RELION image processing software that uses graphics processors (GPUs) to address the most computationally intensive steps of its cryo-EM structure determination workflow. Both image classification and high-resolution refinement have been accelerated more than an order-of-magnitude, and template-based particle selection has been accelerated well over two orders-of-magnitude on desktop hardware. Memory requirements on GPUs have been reduced to fit widely available hardware, and we show that the use of single precision arithmetic does not adversely affect results. This enables high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in a matter of days on a single workstation."

Second, processing the large amounts of data produced by these microscopes requires computational hardware that is not directly accessible to many labs. Even at larger centres the computational requirements are so high that cryo-EM now suffers from a computational bottleneck. The work presented here addresses this second problem, to the end of drastically reducing the computational time and investment necessary for cryo-EM structure determination."

Because radiation damage imposes strict limitations on the electron exposure, micrographs are extremely noisy. Thus, to extract fine structural details, one needs to average over multiple images of identical complexes to cancel noise sufficiently. This is achieved by isolating two-dimensional particle-projections in the micrographs, which can then be recombined into a three-dimensional structure (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cheng et al., 2015</a>). The latter requires the estimation of the relative orientations of all particles, which can be done by a wide range of different image processing programs, such as SPIDER (<a href=\"#bib15\">Frank et al., 1981</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">1996</a>), IMAGIC (<a href=\"#bib39\">van Heel et al., 1996</a>), BSOFT (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heymann and Belnap, 2007</a>), EMAN2 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tang et al., 2007</a>), SPARX (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hohn et al., 2007</a>), FREALIGN (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grigorieff, 2007</a>), XMIPP (<a href=\"#bib31\">Scheres et al., 2008</a>), RELION (<a href=\"#bib33\">Scheres, 2012a</a>), or SIMPLE (<a href=\"#bib10\">Elmlund and Elmlund, 2012</a>)."

We also utilise a number of libraries provided within the CUDA framework, such as cuFFT for fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and CUB/thrust for sorting and other standard functions.

This iterative algorithm involves two fundamental steps at every iteration. In the expectation, or E-step, one calculates probability distributions for the relative orientations of all particles based on the current estimate of the 3D map. In the subsequent maximization, or M-step, one updates the estimate for the 3D map. Intuitively, these two steps represent alignment of the particles with respect to a common 3D reference, and reconstruction of a new reference map, respectively. The algorithm is typically started from an initial 3D reference map at low resolution, and is guaranteed to increase the likelihood of the 3D map given the data and the prior at every iteration, until converging onto the nearest local minimum. In the presence of structural variability in the data set, multiple 3D reference maps, or 3D classes, can be refined simultaneously. In this case, the class assignments of the particles are not known either. RELION also allows the refinement of multiple 2D references, or 2D classes. In that case, only in-plane orientations are sampled."

In practice, to limit the number of operations, stages (i) and (ii) are performed twice for every particle. A first pass examines all orientations using a relatively coarse orientational sampling, and a second pass re-examines the regions of orientational space with significant probabilities at an increased sampling density. Still, millions of orientations and translations are typically compared for each particle at every iteration. Converting the resulting differences to weights is a relatively cheap operation as each image-orientation pair at this stage is represented by a single scalar value. The back-projection in operation (iv) is more demanding since it is again necessary to work with all pixels of each image in multiple orientations. After the E-step has been evaluated for all (typically tens to hundreds of thousand) particles, in the M-step the running sum in 3D Fourier space is transformed into an updated 3D reference map for the next iteration. The corresponding reconstruction algorithm is expensive in terms of computer memory, but it typically needs orders of magnitude less time than the E-step because it is only performed once for every iteration. Therefore, operations (i), (ii) and (iv) of the E-step have dominated execution time in previous versions of RELION."

GPUs however require much broader low-level parallelism to increase performance substantially. Our implementation of RELION therefore required a reformulation to expose additional available parallelism.

In operations (i) and (ii) of the E-step, it would for instance require very large amounts of fast memory to pre-calculate projections of the 3D reference maps for all examined orientations. Pre-calculation could potentially increase re-use of data on the GPU, but it would impose severe limitations on the number of simultaneously examined references, input image sizes, and sampling granularity. Instead, like the CPU code, our implementation stores a two-fold oversampled Fourier transform of each reference in GPU memory, and 2D slices (along any orientation) are extracted only when needed. This alleviates limitations imposed by hardware, and makes it possible to improve performance through the use of so-called GPU <i>textures</i>. Textures store data that require fast lookup, and the corresponding <i>texture units</i> provide support for performing non-integer pixel interpolation of texture data in a single instruction with only marginal loss of precision. In graphics applications, textures are used to efficiently rescale image data. In RELION, they turn out to be well-suited for the resampling operations when taking slices from the 3D Fourier transform. The on-the-fly extraction of 2D Fourier slices is combined with the very broad parallelism of calculating squared differences between all pixels of all particle images and the reference projections in all orientations and all translations. For the technically interested reader, details of how we exploit this parallelism in our implementation of the squared difference calculation are presented in Appendix I. Technical details of how we also accelerated operation (iv) of the E-step, the back-projection of 2D images into the oversampled 3D Fourier transform, are presented in Appendix II. When combined, the E-step can now be evaluated in a fraction of the runtime previously needed."

The R-value map of a micrograph considers all possible rotations of each template, and is subsequently used in a peak-search algorithm that locates particles within the original micrograph (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These calculations are performed in Fourier space, where they are highly efficient (<a href=\"#bib28\">Roseman, 2003</a>). In fact, they are so fast that their execution time becomes negligible compared to the time spent performing FFTs to transform image objects between real and Fourier spaces. Consequently, even though reference templates are also treated as independent tasks to increase parallelism in the GPU version, a much larger gain is found at the level of template rotations, through parallel execution of FFTs. For example, when using 5-degree incremental template rotations, 72 such inverse FFTs are now performed concurrently on the GPU through the cufft cuda library.

This is most prominent for increasing numbers of pixels, orientations and classes, due to the increased low-level parallelism RELION-2 has been designed to use efficiently. Therefore, calculations where many classes and orientations need to be sampled, e.g. 3D classifications over multiple classes and with fine sampling of orientations, experience the greatest gain from the acceleration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Traditionally such large problems have required cluster-size resources with high-performance interconnects for fast communication. As seen in the performance benchmarks, RELION-2 makes it possible to run many of these calculations even on workstations or low-cost desktop solutions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). GPU hardware evolves rapidly, but appendix XI contains a few recommendations about the solutions we currently think are most cost-efficient. For sufficiently large computational problems, relion\u2019s processing time scales linearly with increased number of classes, but since the extra calculations are much faster with the GPU-enabled version the relative advantage is larger the more classes are used (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In practice we believe this will make it more common to use very large numbers of classes in 3D classification. Further scrutiny reveals that the calculations still performed on the CPU actually dominate both the execution and scaling even for the GPU version (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), which indicates new bottlenecks are now limiting scaling - we intend to focus on these parts of the code for future improvements."

While there are professional GPUs with good double precision performance, the consumer market is dominated by visualisation and gaming applications, and for this reason cheap hardware only provides good performance for single precision. Even for professional hardware, the performance is better with single precision, although the difference is smaller. This makes it highly desirable to use single precision arithmetics wherever possible. In addition to much better floating-point throughput, single precision calculations reduce the memory requirements by a factor two, and make it possible to employ textures for image rotation. The relative advantage of single precision can thus be much higher on GPUs compared to CPUs. Because the required precision depends on the algorithms used in the application, part of the development of RELION-2 involved the evaluation of reconstructed quality when using single precision. We evaluate this primarily by examining the agreement of refinements results, characterising both the reconstructed volume and the image orientation assignment statistics. As image orientations are analogous to a location and rotation on the unit sphere, we compared refinement results of the EMPIAR 10028 dataset by the distribution of angular differences for all images. Two double-precision CPU refinements (using different random seeds) produce distributions where 81% of images fall within <math id=\"inf2\"><msup><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2218</mo></msup></math> of the other. Given that this distribution is modulated by the sine of the angle, this is a very close agreement. The single-precision GPU implementation finds 82% of images within the same <math id=\"inf3\"><msup><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2218</mo></msup></math> tolerance. (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In other words, the differences due to random seeds are at least as large as any systematic variation between the CPU and GPU versions. While a small loss of precision was observed e.g. in the fast interpolation (texture) intrinsics, the assignments of image orientations are similar enough to not influence the final reconstruction quality (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In contrast, single-precision execution of the iterative gridding algorithm that underlies the reconstruction in the M-step (<a href=\"#bib33\">Scheres, 2012a</a>) did exhibit a notable deviation from the double-precision version when first tested. Therefore, we opted for a hybrid implementation of the algorithm: The computationally demanding slice projections, probability calculations, and back-projections in the E-step are performed in single precision on the GPU, while the reconstruction in the M-step remains in double precision on the CPU. Because the M-step is partially responsible for the new bottlenecks apparent in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> this is a candidate for additional future optimisation, but for now the hybrid approach provides a good compromise."

Fortunately its peak use is however <i>not</i> during the accelerated, computationally most intensive, parts of the algorithm. Rather, memory use peaks during the M-step, which is executed on the CPU using the gridding reconstruction algorithm mentioned above. The amount of available GPU memory still remains a limitation, as it determines the capacity for storage of the oversampled Fourier transforms of one or more references. This is of particular concern for larger and higher-resolution structures, which require more memory to be faithfully represented. When resolving detail at the Nyquist frequency, due to a twofold oversampling (associated with gridding during reconstruction), relion requires memory corresponding to twice the cube of the image dimension. For example, when using 400<math id=\"inf5\"><msup><mi></mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>-pixel particle images, the required grid size is 800<math id=\"inf6\"><msup><mi></mi><mn>3</mn></msup></math>, which becomes <math id=\"inf7\"><mo>\u223c</mo></math>2 GB per class, since each value requires 4 bytes in single precision. Moreover, as the reconstructed object also needs to be accommodated, this number is effectively multiplied by 2.5. In practice, memory use with image sizes up to <math id=\"inf8\"><msup><mn>400</mn><mn>2</mn></msup></math> indicate that at most 6 GB of GPU memory is needed to perform refinement to Nyquist (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Therefore, we now find it highly beneficial to explicitly cache data on local solid state devices (SSDs), as has also been observed for GPU-accelerated CTF estimation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Zhang, 2016</a>). To allow this in a straightforward way, RELION-2 features the ability to automatically copy data sets to fast local disks prior to refinement, which further increases performance during less computationally intensive steps, such as 2D classification."

The latter were used for comparison with our autopicking results, with a center cutoff distance of 35 pixels for particles to be considered identical (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Filtered selection did not decrease the quality of the results, but provided a just-so-slightly increased recall without increasing the false discovery rate (FDR, see e.g. (<a href=\"#bib23\">Langlois and Frank, 2011</a>) for definitions of recall and FDR). When filtering and GPU-acceleration are combined, a single GPU provides roughly 120 times the performance of an 8-core desktop, and the desktop can easily be equipped with quad GPUs for about 500x performance gain. In fact, similarly to the regularised likelihood optimisation, the semi-automated particle picking can become limited by disk access unless data is read from an SSD."

This represents the largest presently available dataset in the empiar database, and provides a realistic challenge. We performed an entire processing workflow, including initial beam-induced motion correction in UNBLUR (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grant and Grigorieff, 2015</a>), CTF estimation in Gctf (<a href=\"#bib41\">Zhang, 2016</a>), and finally RELION-2 was employed for automated particle picking, 2D and 3D classification, movie-refinement, particle polishing (<a href=\"#bib34\">Scheres, 2014</a>) and high-resolution auto-refinement on a single workstation with four GTX 1080 cards. Calculating a map to 2.2 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) took a few days \u2013 comparable to, if not faster than, the time required acquire this amount of high-quality data. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> shows an overview of the most computationally demanding steps during this processing. The parts of the workflow that have been GPU-accelerated no longer dominate execution, but this exposes other new bottlenecks. In particular, steps that involve reading large movie files from disk become problematic. We also note that due to the rigid nature of the <math id=\"inf18\"><mi>\u03b2</mi></math>-galactosidase complex used for this benchmark, only a single 3D classification was performed. This is not representative for many other use cases: typically 3D classification is repeated multiple times to identify, sort, and isolate structural heterogeneity. In such a scenario, the impact of the GPU acceleration is even larger, as increased or multiple 3D classifications would still not dominate the complete workflow."

The principal benefits drawn from the presented work are twofold. First, the nature of progress in scientific applications is to continually re-evaluate and examine data in many different ways. With ease of re-processing data, the threshold for trial, error and successive improvement of existing methods is now markedly lowered. Second, the order-of-magnitude speedups make it possible to get by with much less hardware for cryo-EM processing, in most cases even desktops. This removes a computational bottleneck for large labs, and enables any group to perform their own reconstruction without access to supercomputers."

The large reduction in computational costs opens up the possibility to perform more ambitious computational analyses without increasing the investments. For example, the favourable scaling of performance we observed for multi-class refinements will make it feasible to use many more classes than was practical before, which will lead to better descriptions of conformational diversity in flexible molecules. Additionally, with even faster algorithms and hardware it might soon be possible to perform highly automated, on-the-fly, structure determination while data acquisition is ongoing. In anticipation of these developments, RELION-2 already implements a pipelined approach for automated execution of pre-determined image processing workflows (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fernandez-Leiro and Scheres, 2016a</a>)."

Although these parts of the algorithm were previously insignificant, in some cases they now collectively account for roughly 50% of total execution time. These parts of the code will see benefit from further modifications. Future work will e.g. strive to further generalise parallelism such that performance is less dependent on the type of refinement performed, as sufficient parallelism is always available within the relion core algorithm. Memory requirements on the GPU are also expected to be reduced further, so that larger image sizes and more classes can be handled to higher resolution."

Generalising the low-level parallelism described here to vectorised CPU calculations, and possibly an open GPU language like OpenCL, will constitute little more than translating this parallelism to new instructions. This is something we intend to pursue in the future. As such, RELION-2 represents a new incarnation of an existing algorithm, which is intended to be developed far further in the following years. Meanwhile, we hope that the current implementation will have as much impact in the broader community as it is already having in our labs."

Second, a workstations equipped with a single Core i7\u20135960\u00a0X CPU (8 cores, 3GHz), four GTX 1080 GPUs, and either a single SSD or two configured in RAID0 for higher bandwidth. Both workstations had 64 GB of memory, and two CPU threads were used for each GPU to improve utilisation. In all cases hyper-threading was utilised to the fullest extent possible to improve CPU performance."

The resulting average micrographs were used for CTF estimation in Gctf (<a href=\"#bib41\">Zhang, 2016</a>). Autopicking with six templates yielded an initial data set of 130,375 particles, which were subjected to reference-free 2D classification using 200 classes. This initial classification was done using <math id=\"inf23\"><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo></mrow></math> downscaled particles (with a pixel size of 1.274 \u00c5 and a box size of 192 pixels). Selection of the 75 best classes resulted in 120,514 particles. All subsequent calculations were performed using <math id=\"inf24\"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo></mrow></math> downscaling (resulting in a pixel size of 0.637 \u00c5 and a box size of 384 pixels). The selected particles were subjected to an initial 3D auto-refinement that used PDB ID 3I3E (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dugdale et al., 2010</a>) as an initial model. Subsequent movie-refinement (with a running average of 7 movie frames and a standard deviation of 2 pixels on the translations) was followed by particle polishing (using a standard deviation of 1000 pixels on the inter-particle distance). The resulting shiny particles were submitted to a single round of 3D classification with exhaustive 7.5-degree angular searches and eight classes. Selection of the seven best classes yielded a final data set of 109,963 particles, which were submitted to 3D auto-refinement. The final resolution was estimated using phase-randomisation to account for the convolution effects of a solvent mask on the FSC between the two independently refined half-maps (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). This mask was generated by binarisation of a 15 \u00c5 low-pass filtered version of the reconstructed map, with addition of a five-pixel wide cosine-shaped soft edge. FSC curves between the model and the solvent-masked map were calculated with <span class=\"monospace\">relion_image_handler</span>. The same soft solvent mask was also used for the calculation between EMDB-2984 and the atomic model."

Comparing the CPU version with the GPU version using increasing levels of low-pass filtering yields progressively higher recalls at similar FDRs. The GPU version yields identical results to that of the CPU version, but at a much reduced computational costs. Filtering does not depend on GPU-acceleration, and will perform similarly using only CPUs."

In our implementation, this difference-calculation kernel is by far the most significant computational load during classification and refinement. The computations are performed in Fourier space (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), where projections are interpolated slices of the Fourier transform of the reference model. The tri-linear interpolation of the Fourier components performed during extraction of the Fourier-volume slice is both computationally heavy, and has significant latency associated with reading data. This is despite the use of texture objects, which use a dedicated cache and specialised storage formats. To improve memory usage, it is important to reuse the sliced data in the kernel. The maximum number of parallel tasks within this kernel is <math id=\"inf26\"><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>C</mi></mrow></math>, where <math id=\"inf27\"><mi>P</mi></math> is the number of orientations, <math id=\"inf28\"><mi>T</mi></math> the number translations, and <math id=\"inf29\"><mi>C</mi></math> the number of Fourier components (pixels). However, reuse of sliced data from the reference model requires at least one synchronisation and data communication within the <math id=\"inf30\"><mi>P</mi></math> groups of processes comparing translations with a common Fourier slice. To avoid performance penalties, we make sure all such groups are executed in the same thread-block to enable fast communication through shared memory."

We fur- ther improve performance by grouping reference orientations (in groups of <i>P<sub>0</sub></i> slices) to also enable reuse of translated image components. The number of completely parallel tasks is then in fact reduced, which may limit perfor- mance by potentially not saturating the hardware with a sufficient number of independent tasks. However, this reduction in turn reduces the number of reads of the Fourier transform of the particle image. This, and the reuse of translated components, ultimately provided a significant performance boost."

The two arbitrary parameters <i>N</i> and <i>P<sub>0</sub></i> can be tuned to balance the shared memory size with the reuse of the translation intermediates. To avoid overfit- ting these parameters to benchmarking systems, we have selected values that yield a suitable minimum required shared memory size for typical available\u00a0hardware."

In the majority of cases this constitutes a more sparse operation, as a few orientations and/or classifications are typically dominating. If one were to invoke the same kernel in this case, many thread-blocks would contribute insignificantly or even perform null work. We therefore chose to specialise this as a separate kernel, to reach better efficiency and stay within hardware requirements under sparse but fine sampling. The fine-grained search therefore proceeds through a preparatory stage wherein the significantly contributing combinations of reference orientations and image translations are divided into jobs (see <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Lists of the relevant orientations and translations are also created. A specialised kernel is then provided with this list of jobs, and invoked in parallel to execute them independently. Jobs are also created to reuse unique information (a reference slice), and minimise overhead associated with reading relevant translation indices from high-latency global memory by using sequential translations within each job. See <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> for an in-depth description of this implementation."

These are read by the kernel function thread-block, rather than inferred based on block ID. This creates overhead and possible latency of global memory access, which makes this kernel even further separated from the exhaustive kernel represented in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>. Here, a pixel-chunk of a single projection is reused for a number of sequential translations, arranged contiguously if possible. Invoking separate thread blocks for non-contiguous translations allows some implicit indexing of them, which affords better access patterns for SIMD instructions and reduced latency. Due to the sparseness, shared memory can also be used for in-kernel summation of all pixels of each image, which despite some some required explicit thread-level synchronisation increases throughput by avoiding the higher latency of atomic write operations during image summation in the coarse-search kernel."

The issue of parallel processes writing to the same memory position simultaneously is avoided in the gather approach by restricting subsets of positions in the output to individual processes. In the scatter approach, on the contrary, write clashes are handled with atomic writes, where memory positions are reserved just in time prior to the write operation. This extra set of operations have an overhead and can become a considerable performance issue in regions with many clashes, e.g. close to the origin. However, the scatter approach enables full reuse of the interpolation of pixels for all the affected voxels, since no access restrictions exists for write operations."

In our benchmarks the scatter approach performed significantly better and was thus selected as the standard. This is most likely due to the fact that individual images on average contribute very sparsely to the 3D volume and hence only affect a small subset of voxels. Since the number of processes in the gather approach is proportional to the number of voxels, this renders many initiated processes jobless. Both this issue and the reduced reuse of intermediates can be addressed to some degree by enabling processes to manage groups of voxels. This method yielded some performance improvements, but the scatter approach nevertheless provides superior performance."

Titan-X (Pascal) cards are likely to provide the highest performance, but due to the substantial price premium of these cards, we believe GTX 1080 cards offer better value. The workstation with quad GTX 1080 GPUs described in the materials can currently be assembled from parts for around $5000 (See links from the relion home page), or purchased pre-assembled from a few vendors for about $6200. Since the heavy computational steps run on the GPU, there is no need for dual CPU sockets. However, disk I/O bandwidth needs are high, and as seen in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> it helps to use two SSDs configured in RAID0. This provides a powerful cluster replacement for many users, but the quad GPU configuration is sensitive to specific motherboard models and the fans can be a bit loud for a normal office environment. In our labs, the currently most popular option is rather a dual-GPU desktop that is both quiet and smaller. This will work with virtually any motherboard with two GPU sockets. With the cheap GTX 1070 cards the machine parts only cost $2000, and we expect it can be obtained from vendors for roughly $2500. A single SSD is sufficient in this case. All these prices are subject to fluctuations (and changes due to new hardware), but it is nevertheless interesting to compare the performance/price for the most computationally intensive 3D classification with the x86 CPU cluster (<math id=\"inf43\"><mo>\u223c</mo></math>$8500/node, not including fast network). Based on the run times in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, the performance/price ratio is a factor 27 higher for the quad-GPU workstation (with RAID0 SSD) compared to x86 CPU nodes, and a factor 45 higher for the low-cost dual GTX 1070 desktop (at the cost of lower absolute performance). This is based on pre-assembled system prices, and while some vendors might charge more there is always the option to assemble systems from parts for even better value. When it comes to rack-mounted alternatives, many such nodes only work with professional-class (Tesla) cards, but there are larger 4U nodes that work with quad GTX 1080 cards, and even a few 1U models. However, this is highly dependent on the hardware and the reader is advised to seek up-to-date recommendations from vendors or the RELION web pages."

Because RELION estimates the parameters of the prior from the data themselves, this type of approach is called an empirical Bayesian approach (see Wikipedia for more details: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method</a>). Note that un-regularised likelihood optimisation algorithms (like e.g. implemented in Xmipp, and in a limited manner also in Frealign) do not include a prior on the model. These approaches are also called \"maximum likelihood\", but often depend on more ad-hoc regularisation approaches, for example through customised low-pass filters. To distinguish RELION from the unregularised likelihood approaches, we use the term \"Bayesian\".
