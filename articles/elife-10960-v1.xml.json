We combined these data with known bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channel structural insights and novel functional studies to determine the interactions of specific residues in \u03b22 with Na<sub>v</sub>1.2. We identified a flexible loop formed by <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys, a unique feature among the four \u03b2-subunit isoforms. Moreover, we found that <sup>55</sup>Cys helps to determine the influence of \u03b22 on Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin susceptibility. Further mutagenesis combined with the use of spider toxins reveals that <sup>55</sup>Cys forms a disulfide bond with <sup>910</sup>Cys in the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 domain II pore loop, thereby suggesting a 1:1 stoichiometry. Our results also provide clues as to which disulfide bonds are formed between adjacent Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 <sup>912/918</sup>Cys residues. The concepts emerging from this work will help to form a model reflecting the \u03b2-subunit location in a Na<sub>v</sub> channel complex."

We combined these data with known bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channel structural insights and novel functional studies to determine the interactions of specific residues in \u03b22 with Na<sub>v</sub>1.2. We identified a flexible loop formed by <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys, a unique feature among the four \u03b2-subunit isoforms. Moreover, we found that <sup>55</sup>Cys helps to determine the influence of \u03b22 on Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin susceptibility. Further mutagenesis combined with the use of spider toxins reveals that <sup>55</sup>Cys forms a disulfide bond with <sup>910</sup>Cys in the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 domain II pore loop, thereby suggesting a 1:1 stoichiometry. Our results also provide clues as to which disulfide bonds are formed between adjacent Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 <sup>912/918</sup>Cys residues. The concepts emerging from this work will help to form a model reflecting the \u03b2-subunit location in a Na<sub>v</sub> channel complex."

As key components of these protein assemblies, \u03b2-subunits (1) modify Na<sub>v</sub> channel-gating properties; (2) regulate channel trafficking and localization to distinct surface compartments; and (3) influence channel oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calhoun and Isom, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Namadurai et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, \u03b2-subunits can alter the toxin pharmacology of Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gilchrist et al., 2014</a>), a concept that has been exploited to detect their presence in heterologous expression systems or native tissues (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wilson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wilson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gilchrist et al., 2013</a>). Structurally, \u03b2-subunits are single-transmembrane segment glycoproteins with a short cytoplasmic C-terminal tail and a large V-type immunoglobulin (Ig) extracellular domain that may participate in homophilic and heterophilic interactions, cell adhesion, and cell migration (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calhoun and Isom, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Namadurai et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brackenbury et al., 2008</a>). Although all \u03b2-subunits belong to the Ig family, recent atomic resolution information for the \u03b23 and \u03b24 extracellular domain revealed substantial differences in their 3D structure (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gilchrist et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Namadurai et al., 2014</a>). Given their distinct features and functional roles, it has now become clear that each \u03b2-subunit structure should be obtained and assessed separately. Of the four known \u03b2-subunits and their splice variants (\u03b21\u20134; gene names <i>Scn1b</i>-<i>Scn4b</i>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Isom et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Isom et al., 1995a</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Morgan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Patino, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yu, 2003</a>), \u03b22 and \u03b24 form a disulfide bond with an unidentified Cys within particular Na<sub>v</sub> channel isoforms. In contrast, non-covalent interactions underlie \u03b21 and \u03b23 association with Na<sub>v</sub> channels as well as other members of the voltage-gated ion channel family (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calhoun and Isom, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Namadurai et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Marionneau, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nguyen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Deschenes et al., 2008</a>). Aberrant behavior of the ubiquitously expressed \u03b22 and \u03b24 subunits has been linked to disorders such as long-QT syndrome, atrial fibrillation, sudden infant death syndrome, and epilepsy, possibly through dysregulation of the Na<sub>v</sub> channel signaling complex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Medeiros-Domingo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baum et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Watanabe et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, \u03b22 has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and neuropathic pain and is therefore of potential interest for developing novel therapeutic strategies (<a href=\"#bib51\">O'Malley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lopez-Santiago, 2006</a>). Finally, \u03b22 is targeted by secretase enzymes, an observation that suggests a potential contribution to Alzheimer's disease (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gersbacher et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2005</a>)."

In contrast, auxiliary proteins are the topic of herculean research efforts in other fields where their role as vital contributors to cellular function or in forming drug receptor sites is well established (<a href=\"#bib13\">Copits and Swanson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gee et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Milstein and Nicoll, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dolphin, 2012</a>). To begin to appreciate \u03b22 function and lay the foundations for constructing an interacting model with Na<sub>v</sub> channels, we first need to define the mechanism by which \u03b22 regulates Na<sub>v</sub> channel function. In particular, knowledge of the relative orientation of both partners will help to assess whether a mutation modifies channel function or influences complex assembly. To this end, we solved the crystal structure of the extracellular \u03b22 domain at 1.35\u00c5 and found a <sup>55</sup>Cys-containing binding region that modulates Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin susceptibility by \u03b22. Next, we exploited a combination of Na<sub>v</sub> channel mutagenesis, biochemistry, and \u03b22-induced alterations in spider toxin pharmacology to uncover a disulfide bond between <sup>55</sup>Cys and a partnering Cys located in the domain II S5-S6 pore loop of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2. Remarkably, Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and close relatives Na<sub>v</sub>1.8/Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 do not possess a corresponding Cys, which may explain a lack of \u03b22 effect on Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 toxin pharmacology. In concert with the\u00a0available structural information on bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib53\">Payandeh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shaya et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>), our results provide conceptual insights into the location of the \u03b22-subunit in the Na<sub>v</sub> channel-signaling complex."

The construct encompasses residues 30\u2013153 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and contains a single Cys mutation (C55A) to facilitate crystallization [The C55A mutation is located on the protein surface and therefore unlikely to affect the overall structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a,d</a>).]. The h\u03b22 configuration displays an Ig-like fold, consisting of eleven \u03b2-strands and three 3<sub>10</sub> helices. Other than the mutated Cys (C55A), this domain contains four additional cysteines that are arranged in two bonds. The first, intra-subunit bond, is strictly conserved among all four \u03b2-subunit isoforms and is mediated by <sup>50</sup>Cys and <sup>127</sup>Cys buried within the core where it links two opposing faces of the protein. The second intra-subunit bond is located within a loop that spans residues 70\u201377 and connects strand \u03b2<sub>5</sub> to \u03b2<sub>6</sub> via <sup>72</sup>Cys - <sup>75</sup>Cys (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a\u2013b</a>).

Aside from the distinct <sup>72</sup>Cys - <sup>75</sup>Cys disulfide bond, there are extensive variances in loop lengths and \u03b2 strands, indicating that h\u03b22 and h\u03b24 have diverged substantially (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,c</a>). Yet, at a protein sequence level, h\u03b22 is most closely related to h\u03b24 (26% identical; 48% conserved) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d,e</a>). Of note is that the N-terminal region of h\u03b22 is structured rather than disordered in h\u03b24, adding an additional short \u03b2 strand (\u03b2<sub>1</sub>) which interacts with the novel \u03b2<sub>4</sub> strand. The strand following the unique disulfide bond is shortened in h\u03b22 and two additional 3<sub>10</sub> helices can be seen, whereas one that is present in h\u03b24, no longer exists in h\u03b22. A comparison with the h\u03b23 structure also shows substantial divergence in loop lengths at particular locations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a>). The h\u03b23 extracellular domain misses the additional N-terminal \u03b2-strand; instead, its N-terminus is anchored via a disulfide bridge between <sup>26</sup>Cys and <sup>48</sup>Cys, resulting in positional shifts in excess of 15\u00c5."

The h\u03b22 subunit possesses a corresponding Cys at position 55 that is located in a longer loop which may result in an altered spatial position of this residue when compared to h\u03b24 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,c</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d,e</a>). In addition, the residues immediately N-terminal to <sup>55</sup>Cys are stabilized through a \u03b2-strand interaction between strands \u03b2<sub>1</sub> and \u03b2<sub>4</sub>, both of which are absent in h\u03b24. Taken together, these observations suggest that the environment of this key Cys may differ in both isoforms.

                                "text": "Previously, we and others discovered that \u03b2-subunits can manipulate the pharmacological sensitivities of Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wilson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gilchrist et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Doeser et al., 2014</a>). In particular, \u03b24 is capable of dramatically altering animal toxin binding to rat (r)Na<sub>v</sub>1.2a (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gilchrist et al., 2013</a>). For example, the spider toxin ProTx-II (<a href=\"#bib44\">Middleton et al., 2002</a>) binds to voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) I, II, and IV in rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bosmans et al., 2008</a>), and is \u223cfive-fold less potent when \u03b24 is present. [An intriguing concept is that ProTx-II may also bind directly to \u03b24 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gee et al., 1996</a>); however, our isothermal calorimetry experiments do not support this notion (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).] To examine whether this protective ability extends to h\u03b22, we expressed hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes and measured ProTx-II susceptibility without or in the presence of the \u03b2-subunit (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1,</a> <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similar to \u03b24, we observe that the h\u03b22 subunit expresses abundantly and traffics to the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>) where it is able to reduce the degree of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 current inhibition by ProTx-II. Specifically, 100\u00a0nM ProTx-II reduces hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 conductance to \u223c17% of peak whereas the current remaining in the presence of h\u03b22 is typically more than \u223c64% of peak conductance, thereby demonstrating a protective effect. Other gating parameters such as conductance-voltage (G\u2013V) and channel availability relationships are unaffected (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Next, we sought to determine if <sup>55</sup>Cys in h\u03b22 is involved in reducing hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 susceptibility to ProTx-II by mutating this residue to an Ala. Indeed, the C55A mutant traffics to the membrane and causes ProTx-II inhibition of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 to resemble that of the wild-type (WT) channel without h\u03b22 present (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c,d</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although Ala wields a small side chain and is often employed in mutagenesis studies, we also replaced <sup>55</sup>Cys with a Ser, as it most closely resembles Cys in terms of size and electric properties. Similar to WT h\u03b22 and C55A, the C55S mutation impaired neither channel expression nor surface trafficking (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, the extent of ProTx-II-induced hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 inhibition in the presence of C55S is indistinguishable from that of the channel alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Altogether, these results support the notion that h\u03b22 conveys ProTx-II protection to hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 via <sup>55</sup>Cys and may relate to previous work in which the loss of the covalent link between r\u03b22 and hNa<sub>v</sub>1.1 disrupts the targeting of r\u03b22 to nodes of Ranvier and to the axon initial segment in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2012</a>)."

Remarkably, this additional loop is highly conserved in almost all species that express \u03b22, suggesting an evolutionary conserved contribution to function (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To determine if this loop regulates the gating or pharmacological influence of h\u03b22 on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2, we mutated <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys to Ala (C72A C75A) but found that it is functionally indistinguishable from WT h\u03b22 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The C72A C75A mutant localizes to the oocyte membrane surface without or with hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 co-expression. Moreover, typical gating parameters and hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 inhibition by 100\u00a0nM ProTx-II in the presence of C72A C75A is similar to that observed for the channel when co-expressed with WT h\u03b22 (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). The lack of effect of the C72A C75A mutant on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 function suggests that this disulfide bond is not essential for folding, and that its disruption may not significantly affect the position or environment of <sup>55</sup>Cys. To verify this hypothesis, we produced recombinant h\u03b22 extracellular domain containing three Cys mutations: C55A, C72A, and C75A. Size exclusion chromatography demonstrates that the mutant produces monomeric protein, indicating that the bond between <sup>72</sup>Cys and <sup>75</sup>Cys is unessential for folding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). Furthermore, we obtained a crystal structure of the triple mutant at 1.85\u00c5 which overlays well onto the C55A structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). The only significant difference is situated in the loop containing both cysteines, which now displays a single conformation. Although the spatial organization of this loop does not seem to impact the ability of h\u03b22 to modulate hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 gating or sensitivity to ProTx-II, this region may yet play a functional role in modulating other Na<sub>v</sub> channel isoforms."

To explore the possibility of an h\u03b22 anchoring point in this region, we individually replaced each of the three cysteines found here (<sup>910</sup>Cys, <sup>912</sup>Cys, and <sup>918</sup>Cys) with Ser. When expressed without or with WT h\u03b22, the C910S mutant exhibits the same degree of inhibition by 100\u00a0nM ProTx-II, indicating that the protective effect of h\u03b22 is lost and that <sup>910</sup>Cys is a critical residue for h\u03b22 binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013b</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the C918S mutant retains protection from 100\u00a0nM ProTx-II by the \u03b2-subunit. The C912S mutant displays a split toxin-sensitive population that is consistently observed throughout multiple oocyte batches. One fraction of experiments reveals hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 current inhibition as though no h\u03b22 is present whereas another displays protection against 100\u00a0nM ProTx-II, similar to the WT channel and C918S mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). To verify the presence of h\u03b22, oocytes were collected after recording and checked for expression by Western blot (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>), thereby indicating that the observed loss-of-protection effects indeed relate to the hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 mutation."

                                "text": "Altogether, these results hint towards a possibility of mutation-induced shifts in intra-subunit disulfide bond formations, a plausible scenario given the close vicinity of <sup>910</sup>Cys, <sup>912</sup>Cys, and <sup>918</sup>Cys in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2. To evaluate this hypothesis, we constructed a set of double Cys to Ser mutations (C910S C912S, C910S C918S, and C912S C918S) and examined the effects on ProTx-II susceptibility without and in the presence of h\u03b22 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013b</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). According to previous work with rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a, mutating <sup>912</sup>Cys or <sup>918</sup>Cys results in a bridge between <sup>910</sup>Cys and the remaining intact cysteine (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). These experiments were carried out without a \u03b22 subunit and with GVIIJ (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gajewiak et al., 2014</a>), a unique \u03bcO\u00a7-conotoxin that directly competes for binding to <sup>910</sup>Cys; however, the rest of its binding site remains unexplored. In our hands, high concentrations of GVIIJ are needed to achieve an effect, and efficacy towards hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 is augmented in case of the C910S mutation (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), two complicating factors that made us revert to ProTx-II which is more potent and has clearly delineated binding sites within Na<sub>v</sub>1.2. Our experiments on these double mutants show a much clearer picture wherein h\u03b22 only protects against ProTx-II when <sup>910</sup>Cys is intact: the C912S C918S mutant still has lowered toxin susceptibility whereas C910S C912S and C910S C918S are completely inhibited by 100\u00a0nM ProTx-II, suggesting that these mutants no longer bind h\u03b22 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013b</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Altogether, these results indicate that <sup>910</sup>Cys is the disulfide bond partner of <sup>55</sup>Cys in h\u03b22, while <sup>912</sup>Cys and <sup>918</sup>Cys could form an intra-subunit bridge. At first sight, the C912S data which show the split population appear in conflict with this interpretation. However, it is conceivable that losing the <sup>912</sup>Cys- <sup>918</sup>Cys bond results in the formation of a non-native bond between <sup>910</sup>Cys and\u00a0<sup>918</sup>Cys (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). Indeed, when <sup>918</sup>Cys is mutated in addition to <sup>912</sup>Cys, <sup>918</sup>Cys again allows toxin protection by h\u03b22 similar to WT, suggesting it has become available again. The data also indicate that a non-native disulfide bond between <sup>910</sup>Cys and <sup>912</sup>Cys may not occur in the C918S mutant, likely because such a Cys-Val-Cys disulfide bond could be too constrained. Importantly, h\u03b22 cannot protect the C910S C918S or the C910S C912S mutants from 100\u00a0nM ProTx-II, indicating that neither <sup>912</sup>Cys nor <sup>918</sup>Cys can compensate for the loss of <sup>910</sup>Cys (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>).<sup>918</sup>"

It is worth noting that WT myc-tagged r\u03b22 can form higher-order oligomers under non-reducing conditions, which may complicate the interpretation of immunoblots (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, these oligomers disappear upon removal of <sup>55</sup>Cys, further highlighting the reactivity of this residue. Notwithstanding this phenomenon, probing crude cell lysate uncovers a clear co-migration of myc-tagged r\u03b22 with rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a under non-reducing conditions, since co-expression yields a distinct myc-stained band above the highest r\u03b22 oligomer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Substitution of either <sup>55</sup>Cys in r\u03b22 or <sup>910</sup>Cys in rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a with Ser results in the loss of this covalent complex. Furthermore, the presence of DTT completely abolishes the r\u03b22-rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a complex as well as the r\u03b22 oligomers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). Thus, these results confirm our toxin experiments and suggest the formation of a disulfide bond between <sup>910</sup>Cys in the DII S5-S6 linker of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 and <sup>55</sup>Cys in \u03b22. In addition to investigating the interaction of rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a and r\u03b22 in crude lysate from injected oocytes, we also pulled down r\u03b22 with an antibody directed against the C-terminal myc-tag and treated with DTT before loading onto a tris-acetate gel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). In this experiment, we observe that WT rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a is present only when co-expressed with WT r\u03b22. Moreover, both <sup>910</sup>Cys within the channel and <sup>55</sup>Cys in r\u03b22 are required for co-immunoprecipitation, thereby pointing to their role in forming a disulfide bond between both subunits (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

To examine this notion, we measured ProTx-II susceptibility of rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a and its C910S mutant expressed in oocytes without or with the r\u03b24-subunit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a,b</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>).

Although h\u03b22 seems to be anchored to the DII pore forming region, ProTx-II was previously shown to target VSDs I, II, and IV (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bosmans et al., 2008</a>), suggesting that the protective effect of h\u03b22 is through occlusion of the ProTx-II binding site in one or more of these regions. In order to determine which one, we assembled a set of animal toxins that, together, interact with VSDI, II, and IV in Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bosmans et al., 2008</a>), and tested whether or not their function is influenced by h\u03b22 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>). A previous study in which rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a S3b-S4 paddle loops from each domain (I-IV) were transplanted into a homotetrameric K<sub>v</sub> channel to identify the VSDs with which toxins interact (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bosmans et al., 2008</a>), found that the tarantula toxin PaurTx3 and scorpion toxin AahII (<a href=\"#bib40\">Martin et al., 1987</a>) exclusively target VSDII and VSDIV, respectively. In addition, the tarantula toxins ProTx-I and ProTx-II both interact with the voltage sensor in DII and DIV, whereas ProTx-II also binds to DI with high affinity. Here, we tested these four toxins on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 without and with h\u03b22 to determine if the presence of the subunit impacts toxin function. Aside from ProTx-II, we observe no significant difference in PaurTx3, AahII, or ProTx-I effect which suggests that h\u03b22 does not impede binding of these toxins to VSDII and VSDIV (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b\u2013c</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, we speculate that h\u03b22 primarily influences VSDI and as such, is located near this region (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>). Since \u03bcO\u00a7-conotoxin GVIIJ function is also influenced by h\u03b22 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gajewiak et al., 2014</a>), it will be interesting to investigate a possible VSDI binding site for this toxin. While our data are limited by the absence of VSDI- and VSDIII-specific toxins and do not exclude the possibility of non-overlapping binding sites for a particular toxin and h\u03b22 on the same VSD, or of direct competition for binding to the DII S5-S6 loop, they may yet prove valuable as insights into h\u03b22 function accrue."

Since the ability to compare the distinct organizational features of \u03b2-subunits will provide valuable information as to their difference in action, we now obtained detailed structural information for the extracellular domain of h\u03b22 at a resolution of 1.35\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a\u2013b</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

Moreover, h\u03b22 contains a Cys at position 55 that, when mutated, disrupts the influence of h\u03b22 on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 toxin pharmacology (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b\u2013d</a>). Next, we combined mutagenesis and biochemical studies with spider and scorpion toxins that target specific VSDs within Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gilchrist et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bosmans et al., 2008</a>) to probe the interaction with h\u03b22. As a result, we found that <sup>55</sup>Cys forms a distinct disulfide bond with <sup>910</sup>Cys located in the domain II S5-S6 loop of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2, thereby revealing a 1:1 stoichiometry (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013b</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also exploited this toxin-reporter approach to investigate the possibility of intra-subunit disulfide bond formations between <sup>910</sup>Cys, <sup>912</sup>Cys, and <sup>918</sup>Cys in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2, three reactive residues that are in close vicinity to each other. The outcome of these experiments indicates that <sup>912</sup>Cys and <sup>918</sup>Cys form an intra-subunit bridge in WT hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). When mutating <sup>918</sup>Cys, h\u03b22 still interacts with <sup>910</sup>Cys whereas substituting <sup>912</sup>Cys suggests the possibility for bond formation between <sup>910</sup>Cys and <sup>918</sup>Cys (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>)."

In concert, immunocytochemical studies in the heart and electrophysiological measurements in mammalian cell lines or oocytes disagree on whether h\u03b22 can modulate hNa<sub>v</sub>1.5 function (<a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson and Bennett, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zimmer and Benndorf, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Dhar Malhotra et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Maier et al., 2004</a>).

In contrast, amino acid substitutions in the DII S5-S6 pore loop of particular Na<sub>v</sub> channel variants are linked to diseases. For example, more than 30 mutations have been identified within this region in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.1, several of which relate to Dravet syndrome (<a href=\"#bib12\">Claes et al., 2009</a>). This includes C927F (corresponding to <sup>918</sup>Cys in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2), and other variants which introduce an additional Cys that may interfere with local disulfide bond pattern formation. Therefore, it is conceivable that DII S5-S6 linker mutations may affect channel interactions with h\u03b22 or h\u03b24."

One important observation from bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channel crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib53\">Payandeh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Payandeh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shaya et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) is the domain-swapped architecture of the channel in which the S1-S4 VSD within one subunit is located adjacent to the S5-S6 segments of the next subunit. Such a structural clockwise arrangement has also been consistently observed in prokaryotic and mammalian K<sub>v</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib34\">Long et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jiang et al., 2003</a>). Since hNa<sub>v</sub> channels may be organized in a similar fashion, the determinants of h\u03b22-subunit sensitivity can be located in multiple Na<sub>v</sub> channel domains. For example, we found that h\u03b22 binds to <sup>910</sup>Cys in the S5-S6 loop of DII and influences ProTx-II interaction with VSDI. Although it is challenging to pinpoint its precise location, our data suggest that h\u03b22 is positioned in the cleft between VSDIV and VSDI or VSDI and VSDII where it is presented with an opportunity to interact with both determinants to influence ProTx-II action (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>). In contrast, the consistent picture emerging from the literature is that Na<sub>v</sub> channel fast inactivation and voltage-dependence of activation changes substantially when co-expressed with the \u03b21-subunit in heterologous systems (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen and Cannon, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">McCormick et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Qu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Isom et al., 1995b</a>). Given the pivotal role of VSDIV in channel fast inactivation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bosmans et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Capes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chanda and Bezanilla, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Horn et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sheets et al., 1999</a>), \u03b21 may be positioned close to VSDIV where it can also interact with the extracellular S5-S6 pore-loop within DI (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>), a presumed interacting region (<a href=\"#bib55\">Qu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Makita et al., 1996</a>). Altogether, this model suggests that particular Na<sub>v</sub> channel isoforms can interact simultaneously with a \u03b21- and \u03b22-subunit (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calhoun and Isom, 2014</a>). Future experiments will further investigate the possible locations of \u03b23 and \u03b24 in this model as well as allow the incorporation of mutational effects which is essential to uncover the contribution of \u03b2-subunit mutations to human disorders or contribute to small molecule screening efforts geared towards disrupting or facilitating subunit interactions."

Membranes were incubated for 5 min with an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate before imaging."

                                "text": "<i>Xenopus</i> oocytes were injected with 5\u00a0ng RNA of r\u03b22, rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2, or both (\u223c1:5 molar ratio) and incubated for 48 hr at 17\u00b0C. 30 oocytes were lysed for each condition, using 20\u00a0\u03bcl lysis buffer (1x PBS, 1% DDM, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail [Clontech, USA]) per oocyte, and homogenized by passing through a 25-gauge syringe (adapted from [<a href=\"#bib64\">Yu, 2012</a>]). The lysate was rotated for 1\u00a0hr at 4\u00b0C in a 1.5\u00a0ml microfuge tube, after which it was spun for 30 min at 20,000x<i>g</i> at 4\u00b0C. Subsequent steps were performed at 4\u00b0C or on ice and during all rotations the tube was sealed with parafilm to prevent leakage. A fresh pipette tip was gently swirled in the supernatant to remove the bulk of the white goop by adhering to the tip and supernatant was transferred to a new tube, taking care not to disturb the pellet. The new tube was spun 3 min at 20,000x<i>g</i> and again was swirled with a fresh pipette tip to remove the white goop, after which the clear supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Protein concentration was assayed using a BCA protein concentration kit (Pierce, USA). 150\u00a0\u03bcg protein was brought to 150\u00a0\u03bcl in lysis buffer and 1.5\u00a0\u03bcg (1.5\u00a0\u03bcl of 1\u00a0mg/ml) anti-myc mouse antibody (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA) was added. The tube was rotated overnight at 4\u00b0C after which 30\u00a0\u03bcl protein G-coated magnetic Dynabeads (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA) were added and rotated for 4 hr at 4\u00b0C. The tube was spun for 1 min at 20,000x<i>g</i> and placed on a magnetic rack for 1 min to collect the beads. Supernatant was removed and stored for optimization and troubleshooting purposes, as were subsequent washes. The beads were washed with 200\u00a0\u03bcl wash buffer (1x PBS, 0.4% DDM, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM EDTA) by pipette mixing and then magnetized to collect beads. The wash process was repeated three times. After the third wash, beads were suspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl wash buffer, transferred to another tube, spun for 1 min at 20,000x<i>g</i>, and magnetized to collect beads. The tube was then spun again for 1 min at 20,000x<i>g</i> and magnetized, followed by removal of the last residual fluid. Protein was eluted in 30\u00a0\u03bcl elution buffer (50\u00a0mM glycine, pH 2.8) by incubating for 3 min at room temperature, followed by magnetization and transfer to the final tube. For Western blotting of the immunoprecipitate, 17\u00a0\u03bcl of eluate was combined with 2.5\u00a0\u03bcl 10X reducing agent (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA) and 6.5\u00a0\u03bcl 4X LDS sample loading buffer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA), heated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C, then loaded onto a 1.0\u00a0mm 12-well 3\u20138% Novex Tris-Acetate pre-cast gel (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA). A rabbit anti-PanNav antibody (Alomone labs, Israel) and rabbit anti-h\u03b22 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies, USA) were chosen to avoid cross-reaction of the Western blot secondary antibody against the mouse antibody used for immunoprecipitation. For Western blotting, the primary antibodies were used at 1:200 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively, applied for 1\u00a0hr at room temperature and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with a 1:10,000 goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA)."

The structure is of residues 30-153, with a Cys mutation (C55A) to facilitate crystallization. h\u03b22 has an Ig-like fold, consisting of eleven \u03b2-strands and three 310 helices. This domain contains four additional cysteines that are arranged in two bonds, the first intra-subunit bond is conserved among all four \u03b2-subunit isoforms and is mediated by <sup>50</sup>Cys and <sup>127</sup>Cys buried where it links two opposing faces of the protein. The second intrasubunit bond is in a loop that spans residues 70-77 and connects strand \u03b25 to \u03b26 via <sup>72</sup>Cys <sup>75</sup>Cys. This loop is a unique feature of h\u03b22 since corresponding cysteines are absent in \u03b21, \u03b23, and \u03b24."

When we started these experiments however, it quickly became clear that obtaining biochemical evidence of a Nav channel:\u03b2-subunit complex is far from trivial. We experimented with a range of conditions (published by others and non-published) but were unable to generate satisfying data within the two-month revision period. Nonetheless, we persisted in our efforts and in the two months thereafter, we managed to clearly show that rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a and r\u03b22 form a covalent bond that can be disrupted by mutating <sub>910</sub>Cys and <sub>55</sub>Cys, respectively (an extensive description of the methods has been added to the manuscript). Moreover, we extended these experiments to include r\u03b24 and found that this subunit can also form a disulfide bond with <sup><sub>910</sub></sup>Cys in rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2a. Finally, we noticed that \u03b22 can form multimers that disappear under reducing conditions or after mutating the reactive <sup><sub>55</sub></sup>Cys to Ser. To our knowledge, this potentially complicating factor in interpreting immunoblots has not yet been reported. As such, the manuscript has been substantially revised to include these data:"

As far as the other immunoblots in the manuscript are concerned, adding a loading control to those experiments would require doing every experiment again, including the electrophysiological tests to which the blots relate. Since these blots 1) clearly show a qualitative presence of \u03b2-subunits in the membrane (which goes beyond most of the reports found in the literature); and 2) result from an equal amount of protein loaded onto the gel each time (10\u03bcg), we feel that these immunoblots present an added value in their current form."
