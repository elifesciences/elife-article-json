Inputs to proximal dendrites usually produce large somatic EPSPs that efficiently trigger action potential (AP) output, whereas inputs to distal dendrites are greatly attenuated and may largely modulate AP output. In contrast to most other cortical and hippocampal neurons, hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons show unusually strong excitation by their distal dendritic inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC). In this study, we demonstrate that the ability of these EC inputs to drive CA2 AP output requires the firing of local dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes. Furthermore, we find that CA2 dendritic geometry contributes to the efficient coupling of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes to AP output. These results provide a striking example of how dendritic spikes enable direct cortical inputs to overcome unfavorable distal synaptic locale to trigger axonal AP output and thereby enable efficient cortico-hippocampal information flow."

Inputs to proximal dendrites usually produce large somatic EPSPs that efficiently trigger action potential (AP) output, whereas inputs to distal dendrites are greatly attenuated and may largely modulate AP output. In contrast to most other cortical and hippocampal neurons, hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons show unusually strong excitation by their distal dendritic inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC). In this study, we demonstrate that the ability of these EC inputs to drive CA2 AP output requires the firing of local dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes. Furthermore, we find that CA2 dendritic geometry contributes to the efficient coupling of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes to AP output. These results provide a striking example of how dendritic spikes enable direct cortical inputs to overcome unfavorable distal synaptic locale to trigger axonal AP output and thereby enable efficient cortico-hippocampal information flow."

The experiments show that Na<sup>+</sup> spikes are able to travel from the dendrites to the cell body of these neurons, where they are required to trigger action potentials. However, this is not the case for other neurons in the hippocampus, where the Na<sup>+</sup> spikes are very weak by the time they reach the cell body."

Over the past few decades, dendritically generated Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and NMDA spikes have been identified in many types of neurons, both in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib32\">Llinas et al., 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wong et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schiller et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stuart et al., 1997a</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kamondi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Larkum et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Waters et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Larkum et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). One proposed function of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes is to amplify synaptic potentials and facilitate somatic AP initiation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hausser et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">London and Hausser, 2005</a>). However, in most instances, dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes propagate poorly to the soma and so fail to act as reliable triggers of somatic APs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stuart et al., 1997a</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Golding and Spruston, 1998</a>). Indeed, under physiological conditions, the APs in most principal neurons, including neocortical layer 5 and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), are usually initiated at the axonal initial segment (AIS) before back-propagating to the dendrites (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stuart et al., 1997a</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Golding and Spruston, 1998</a>). Thus, whereas dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes can fine-tune neuronal output and regulate synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Golding et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ariav et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jarsky et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Remy and Spruston, 2007</a>), it is less certain whether these spikes may serve as necessary events to allow synaptic input to trigger AP output (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hausser et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Spruston, 2008</a>). In this study, we report that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes play an important role in the ability of hippocampal CA2 PNs to generate axonal AP output in response to synaptic input from the direct entorhinal cortical (EC) projections that terminate on CA2 PN distal dendrites."

                        "text": "Hippocampal CA2 PNs represent a relatively small population of cells interspersed between CA3 and CA1. Nonetheless, these neurons have recently been shown to be crucial for social memory (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stevenson and Caldwell, 2014</a>) and aggression (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pagani et al., 2014</a>). CA2 PNs also have unique synaptic properties that distinguish them from their CA1 and CA3 neighbors (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">DeVito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Simons et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jones and McHugh, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Caruana et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</a>). Thus, whereas the perforant path (PP) inputs from the EC form weak excitatory synaptic connections at the distal dendrites of CA1 PNs located in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM), PP inputs to CA2 PNs provide a much stronger excitatory drive (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</a>). In contrast the Schaffer collateral (SC) inputs to CA2 are relatively weak and dominated by powerful feed-forward inhibition (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</a>). Finally, individual CA2 PNs provide stronger excitatory drive to CA1 compared to the weaker influence of single CA3 SC inputs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</a>). Such properties enable the CA2 region to function as the nexus of a powerful disynaptic circuit (EC \u2192 CA2 \u2192 CA1), directly linking EC input to hippocampal CA1 output (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jones and McHugh, 2011</a>). How do the EC inputs trigger CA2 AP output, given that synaptic responses at distal dendrites are normally severely attenuated by the cable properties of the dendrites? In this study, we report the PP inputs to distal dendrites in CA2 reliably initiate dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes that are necessary to trigger axonal AP output in response to a single or a burst of PP stimuli. Furthermore, these spikes can overcome strong inhibition to elicit AP output. In contrast, activation of PP inputs to distal dendrites of CA1 PNs with a single stimulus fail to elicit dendritic spikes or somatic APs. Through computational modeling based on morphological reconstructions of CA2 and CA1 PNs, we find that the distinct dendritic geometry of CA2 PNs contributes to the ability of CA2 neurons to efficiently couple dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes to AP output. Thus our data provide a striking example of how dendritic structure and functional properties control the ability of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes to couple synaptic input at distal dendrites to axonal AP initiation. In this manner, CA2 PN dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes ensure the efficient propagation of cortical information through the EC \u2192 CA2 \u2192 CA1 disynaptic pathway."

In contrast, the same PP stimuli generate a smaller synaptic response in CA1 PNs that is usually insufficient to elicit spike output (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</a>). In this study, we first re-investigated the input\u2013output relation between distal synaptic stimulation strength and sub-threshold EPSP size recorded in the soma of CA2 PNs. In these experiments the stimulation electrode was placed in SLM of the CA1 region as before but was closer to the CA1/CA2 border (\u223c50 \u00b5m) than in our previous study (\u223c200 \u00b5m). Consistent with our previous findings (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</a>), the sub-threshold EPSP amplitude in CA2 PNs evoked by PP stimulation was 5\u20136 times larger than that observed in CA1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). Moreover, the EPSP in CA2 PNs was slightly larger than that seen in our previous study, most likely due to the closer proximity to CA2 of the stimulation electrode."

However, recent studies indicate that CA2 PNs receive input largely from EC LII neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cui et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kohara et al., 2014</a>). We investigated whether our focal stimulating electrode in SLM of CA1 might also activate EC LII axons by recording from dentate gyrus granule cells, which receive exclusive innervation from EC LII (<a href=\"#bib61\">Witter, 2007</a>). Indeed, we find that stimulation in SLM of CA1 evokes EPSPs in the granule cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with a tracing study that reported the presence of EC LII axons in SLM of CA1 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tamamaki and Nojyo, 1993</a>).

In agreement with this idea, a phase-plane plot of dV/dt vs membrane voltage showed that APs induced by PP stimulation in CA2 PNs consistently exhibited an initial rapid dV/dt signal at potentials sub-threshold to the main spike (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

The AP threshold (defined as the somatic voltage at which dV/dt reached 50 V/s) was significantly lower in response to PP stimulation (\u221251.6 \u00b1 1.0 mV) compared to somatic current injection (\u221244.3 \u00b1 0.8 mV, n = 17, p &lt; 0.001; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), indicating that dendritic spikes may indeed be required for PP input to trigger somatic APs."

As discussed above, one indication for the necessity of dendritic spikes is our finding that the threshold to fire a somatic AP with PP stimulation is negative to the threshold with somatic current injection (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To directly determine whether dendritic spikes are required for eliciting a CA2 PN somatic action potential under the conditions of our experiments, we applied TTX locally to the proximal dendrites of CA2 PNs, which should block dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes. Indeed, this manipulation fully blocked the ability of single PP stimuli to elicit somatic APs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>, n = 6). After blockade of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes, the EPSP evoked by strong PP stimulation maximally depolarized the soma by \u223c20 mV positive to the resting potential (\u221270 to \u221273 mV) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), below the threshold for driving AP output by somatic current injection. Importantly, the local TTX application exerted a selective effect on dendritic excitability and did not alter PP synaptic transmission or somatic excitability. Thus, there was no change in the sub-threshold PP EPSP or AP firing in response to somatic current injection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>). These results strongly suggest that dendritic spikes in CA2 PNs are mediated by TTX-sensitive voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (see below for additional evidence) and are necessary for somatic AP initiation with a single PP stimulus."

It is thus possible that temporal summation of somatic depolarization driven by EC bursting may be sufficient to elicit AP output in CA2 PNs without the need for dendritic spikes. However, a phase-plane plot revealed the presence of an early rapid rising voltage response preceding the full-blown somatic spikes in response to a 50 Hz burst of 5 PP stimuli (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Moreover, application of somatic TTX revealed the consistent presence of somatic spikelets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>, n = 6) that precede AP initiation in the absence of TTX (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Importantly, local application of TTX to the proximal dendrites fully blocked the ability of PP burst stimuli to drive AP output (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>, n = 3). Thus, under the conditions of our experiments, cortically-driven dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes were necessary for AP output in CA2 PNs with either single or bursts of PP input."

To address whether dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes affect the timing of AP output, we measured population spikes in the CA1 and CA2 stratum pyramidale (SP) cell body layers in response to a burst of PP stimuli (5 pulses at 50 Hz). In CA1, a measurable PS was never observed following the first PP stimulus and was only detected during the later stimuli in a burst, resulting in a latency to firing of 20 ms or more (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the PS amplitude in CA2 was largest in response to the first stimulus of a burst and gradually diminished with successive stimuli (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The decrease in PS response was not due to synaptic depression because the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of PP synapses in CA2 PNs exhibited facilitation rather than depression (PPR = 1.39 \u00b1 0.06, n = 17). Thus, CA2 PNs fired precisely and immediately in response to PP stimulation (latency of the first PS = 4.4 \u00b1 0.1 ms, n = 5), suggesting that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes enable CA2 PNs to respond rapidly to EC burst firing with a high degree of temporal fidelity."

CA2 dendrites generated an active excitatory current response to PP stimulation, manifested as a negative field voltage response in recordings from SR (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). In contrast, PP stimuli never evoked an active response in SR of CA1 or CA3. As the excitatory synaptic response is local to the site of PP input in SLM, the negative field response in SR must be generated by voltage-gated excitatory conductances. Importantly, the amplitude of the active response in SR was correlated with PS size in SP (somatic spike; R = 0.91, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Furthermore, the SR potential preceded the PS in SP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), suggesting that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes precede somatic APs. Moreover, the difference in latency between SR and SP active responses was correlated with the distance between the dendritic and somatic recording sites (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These results suggest that the dendrites of CA2 PNs, but not CA1 or CA3 PNs, fire spikes that propagate to the soma of CA2 PNs to trigger AP output."

For stimulus strengths above 12 V, the PP PSP was significantly enhanced by the GABAR antagonists, indicating that PP stimulation did indeed elicit strong inhibition (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). At an intermediate stimulus strength of 24 V, the PP-evoked PSP depolarized the membrane by only 6.6 \u00b1 0.9 mV with inhibition intact, whereas the PSP size increased to 11.7 \u00b1 1.3 mV when inhibition was blocked (p &lt; 0.001, n = 10). Even at maximum strength (52 V), the PSP amplitude only reached 8.4 \u00b1 1.1 mV with inhibition intact (ranging from 4.3 mV to 13.6 mV, n = 9, excluding responses with dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes or APs). Given that the resting potential of CA2 PNs was \u221275.6 \u00b1 0.7 mV (n = 23) and the AP threshold with somatic current injection was \u221244.3 \u00b1 0.8 mV (n = 17), this level of depolarization is very far from threshold for eliciting somatic APs. Surprisingly, however, extracellular field recordings showed that a single PP stimulus was, in fact, able to evoke a PS in the CA2 cell body layer even with inhibition present (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). As expected, the stimulation threshold for eliciting a PS was higher and the PS amplitude was reduced when inhibition was intact compared to when inhibition was blocked (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>)."

Thus, compared to CA2, the influence of dendritic spikes on AP output in CA1 PNs is rather limited. In contrast to the results on CA1 PNs, dendritic spikes play a more important role in CA1 oriens-alveus interneurons, whose high density of dendritic voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels ensures active spike propagation to the soma, which triggers axonal AP output under some conditions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Martina et al., 2000</a>)."

This provides a striking example of how dendritic morphology critically influences the propagation of dendritic spikes, as suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vetter et al., 2001</a>).

However, despite its larger amplitude, the EPSP generated by the EC inputs is still below the threshold for action potential firing (using somatic current pulses). Given a mean CA2 PN resting potential of \u221275 mV and an AP threshold of \u221244 mV, a &gt;30 mV somatic depolarization is required for CA2 PNs to reach the threshold to fire an AP. Yet we find that, in the absence of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes, the EPSP reaches a peak value of around 15\u201320 mV with strong PP stimulation, far negative to the threshold for eliciting a somatic spike.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no available experimental data regarding distributions or biophysical properties of dendritic voltage-gated conductances from mouse hippocampal CA1 or CA2 PNs. Thus the parameters used in our models were derived from the experimental data obtained from rat hippocampal CA1 PNs. The models incorporated passive membrane properties (R<sub>m</sub> = 40,000 \u03a9 cm<sup>2</sup>, C<sub>m</sub> = 0.75 \u03bcF/cm<sup>2</sup>, R<sub>i</sub> = 150 \u03a9 cm). To account for spines, C<sub>m</sub> of the dendritic compartments was multiplied by a spine scale factor and their R<sub>m</sub> was divided by the same factor. In the CA1 PN model, we used a spine scale factor of 2 in compartments 150 \u03bcm beyond the soma, whereas in the CA2 PN model we used spine scale factors of 2 or 3 for compartments below or beyond 150 \u03bcm from the soma, respectively.

Phase-plane plot and dV/dt values were obtained with the build-in programs in AxoGraph X. AP threshold was defined as the somatic voltage at which dV/dt exceeded 10 V/s or 50 V/s. To determine the EPSP amplitude when dendritic spikes were present (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), EPSP amplitude was determined at the peak depolarization of the EPSP waveform (the latency of peak EPSP is typically &gt;8 ms) following the dendritic spike (dendritic spike latency is usually &lt;5 ms). For <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, EPSP data were excluded if a cell started to fire somatic APs in response to increasing stimulation intensity.

Our data suggest that, compared to CA1, the better propagation due to dendritic geometry of CA2, rather than more excitable dendrites, are important for coupling dendritic spikes to AP output. Our experimental dendritic whole cell current-clamp recordings show the current threshold to generate local spikes is comparable between CA1 and CA2 (CA1: 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 nA versus CA2: 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 nA), indicating that the excitability of CA2 dendrites is comparable to CA1. This point is further supported by our models, in which CA1 distal dendrites can readily generate local spikes (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, new <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2013figure supplement 2</a>). To allow direct visualization of dendritic spike propagation, we now have performed further analyses in both CA1 and CA2 models (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, new <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, see the model session in Results for details). In summary, prominent dendritic spikes (&gt;30 mV in amplitude) are visible at the main branch point of the apical dendrite in CA2 PNs in response to EC inputs. Due to the proximity of this branch point to the soma, the dendritic spikes are subject to very little additional attenuation such that large spikelets can be readily detected at the soma in our experimental conditions. Thus, our models support the idea that the main branch point of CA2 PNs acts as a \u201chot spot\u201d zone to initiate dendritic spikes and trigger axonal AP output. We now have discussed this point in the revised manuscript."
