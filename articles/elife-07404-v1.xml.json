We used novel acoustic tomography to convert echoes into visual representations and compare these cues to traditional echo measurements. We provide a new hypothesis for the echo-acoustic basis of prey detection on surfaces. We propose that bats perceive a change in depth profile and an \u2018acoustic shadow\u2019 cast by prey. The shadow is more salient than prey echoes and particularly strong on smooth surfaces. This may explain why bats look for prey on flat surfaces like leaves using scanning behaviour. We propose that rather than forming search images for prey, whose characteristics are unpredictable, predators may look for disruptions to the resting surface (acoustic shadows). The fact that the acoustic shadow is much fainter on rougher resting surfaces provides the first empirical evidence for \u2018acoustic camouflage\u2019 as an anti-predator defence mechanism."

These experiments showed that the difference in the strength of the echoes from the moth and its surroundings varied depending on the texture of the surface."

This makes the bats' task a little easier as it means that they do not have to make adjustments for the differing sizes and shapes of insects. Instead, they can use an acoustic search image for what the surface is like and look for missing parts covered up by the prey."

Investigations of this aerial hawking behaviour have led to the recognition of novel prey defenses (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fullard and Napoleone, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ratcliffe and Fullard, 2005</a>) and methods of prey detection, tracking, and capture (<a href=\"#bib10\">Goerlitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Conner and Corcoran, 2012</a>). Less well understood is how bats detect insects and other prey on surfaces. This foraging behaviour (gleaning) is perceptually complex and takes several forms. Some bats exploit sexual advertisement calls of prey to determine their location (e.g., <i>Myotis septentrionalis</i> attacks katydids calling for mates on grass tips [<a href=\"#bib26\">ter Hofstede et al., 2008</a>], <i>Trachops cirrhosus</i> similarly exploits displaying frogs [<a href=\"#bib21\">Ryan et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Page and Ryan, 2006</a>]). Other passive gleaners listen for more subtle prey-generated sounds such as fluttering wings (e.g., rhinolophids and hipposiderids, [<a href=\"#bib24\">Siemers and Ivanova, 2004</a>]) and scorpions' walking noises (<a href=\"#bib12\">Holderied et al., 2011</a>). Ground-gleaning bats (<a href=\"#bib24\">Siemers and Ivanova, 2004</a>) use many of the same strategies of hawking including continuous echolocation and shortened duration of pulse intervals to target moving prey."

There is some variation in call structure in gleaning bats. Gleaning <i>Myotis</i> use short frequency-modulated (FM) broadband calls, but behavioural evidence demonstrates these bats are less efficient at this task when background \u2018clutter\u2019 obscures target echoes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arlettaz et al., 2001</a>). Some substrate gleaners may beat their wings at potential prey to elicit movement (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kuc and Kuc, 2012</a>). True active gleaning requires the bat to distinguish a motionless target from its resting surface, which can be a highly structured background. <a href=\"#bib9\">Geipel, Jung, and Kalko (2013)</a> suggested that some species such as <i>Micronycteris microtis</i> perform this task expertly. <i>M. microtis</i> uses broad-band FM multi-harmonic calls of very short duration (\u22480.2 ms) emitted as single calls with intervals of \u224831 ms or in groups of two calls with an intragroup pulse of \u224815 ms (<a href=\"#bib9\">Geipel et al., 2013</a>). Call start frequencies are \u2248143 kHz and end frequencies \u224869 kHz, and there appear to be no terminal feeding buzzes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Geipel et al., 2013</a>). A few authors have used behavioural experiments to investigate the role of approach angles or speculate on the use of a search image (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jones, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Geipel et al., 2013</a>). Until now, however, no solution to the nature of the underlying acoustic cues has been provided."

Some call characteristics have obvious advantages (e.g., low-intensity calls make bats relatively inaudible to eared prey [<a href=\"#bib7\">Faure and Barclay, 1994</a>]), while the importance of other features is unclear, particularly when the surface is highly structured (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arlettaz et al., 2001</a>). Previous experiments with gleaning behaviour have either focused on the bats' use of prey-generated sounds or acoustically simple surfaces (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arlettaz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Siemers and Ivanova, 2004</a>). To our knowledge, no one has considered the specific echo cues used to find motionless prey. In addition, many insects lack ears and/or the wings of resting prey (such as moths) cover the ears, reducing the prey's acoustic sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Faure and Barclay, 1994</a>) and potentially confounding their auditory defences. It is not clear if this resting posture makes them more difficult for bats to detect either by reducing target size or obscuring their body."

First, we test the prediction that acoustic cues used by predators hunting prey are subtle and that novel cues based on image integration are more salient to the predator. Second, we test the prediction that wing position affects prey echoes. In addition, we consider the effect of differently structured surfaces as these may act to conceal resting targets as a form of acoustic camouflage, and that consequently there are perceptual benefits to gleaning from acoustically simple surfaces. We also consider the challenge that prey size and shape may vary greatly and be unpredictable. Thus, we include both multiple surfaces and multiple species of prey in our analysis."

Acoustic tomography in air (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balleri et al., 2010</a>) uses CT to interpret sound waves rather than the X-rays more normally associated with medical applications (<a href=\"#bib5\">Duric et al., 2011</a>) but has not been widely applied in ecology (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balleri et al., 2010</a>). Acoustic impulse responses represent a range profile of echo reflections that have been used to reveal spatial reflection patterns of bat-pollinated flowers and different leaf shapes and determine their role as nectar guides for echolocating bats (<a href=\"#bib11\">von Helversen and von Helversen, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Simon et al., 2011</a>). Our analysis is the first attempt to convert multi-aspect echo-acoustic information into tomographies. Acoustic tomography allows us to transform acoustic information into visual representations. This makes the information-gathering properties of echolocation more conventionally quantifiable giving us access to information not previously accessible. In this study, we use this approach to investigate the perceptual acoustic cues available to active gleaning bats when approaching a motionless prey item on a surface."

We considered the presence of a moth and angle of ensonification as main effects and explored the interaction to test the hypothesis that the effect of a moth is only significant from certain directions. There was no significant effect of the presence of the moth on RMS at any angle though in almost all cases RMS showed a trend towards higher values when the moth was present (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Angle of ensonification did have a significant main effect on RMS on all substrates (p &lt; 0.001 in all models). A Tukey HSD test between angles of ensonification showed specific pairwise differences (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Considering duration, there was a significant interaction between moth and angle on all substrates except limestone, so we treated the comparisons between moth and no-moth separately for each substrate on each angle of ensonification with p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons. At almost all angles of ensonification on all four substrates, duration was longer when a moth was present; however, the effect was only significant in nine of the 28 cases, five of which were on slate. On this substrate, the effect was seen from 20 to 70\u00b0, and the magnitude of the effect was particularly large from 50 to 70\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

There is considerable evidence of occasional behavioural flexibility among species (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ratcliffe and Dawson, 2003</a>), and the degree of flexibility may be related to brain volume (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ratcliffe et al., 2006</a>), however until now, the acoustic basis for gleaning has remained uncertain. Here, we use novel image-integration through tomography to present the first evidence that an acoustic shadow effect may provide the primary cue for prey detection in gleaning. The potential for the use of search images has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jones, 2013</a>) but until now the nature of the cue has remained mysterious. We further suggest that prey-resting surfaces may disrupt this leading to effective acoustic camouflage and that gleaners may counter this through their choice of hunting surface and the use of search images and acoustic scanning."

This has led to two alternative explanations for behavioural guilds within gleaning. In the first case, echolocation itself is rarely used because acoustic masking disrupts target echoes making prey-generated sounds more important and most bats functionally passive gleaners (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arlettaz et al., 2001</a>). In the second case, broadband calls provide detailed information on texture using spectral cues, which allows for active gleaning in bats to distinguish prey amongst clutter (<a href=\"#bib22\">Schmidt, 1988</a>). There has been considerable debate regarding these alternative mechanisms with many authors concluding that alternative signals (prey-generated sounds but also vision and olfaction) are key to prey localization (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kalko and Condon, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arlettaz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Ekl\u00f6f et al., 2002</a>); however, some taxa do appear to rely on echolocation alone."

In this case, <i>M. microtis</i> was shown to use acoustic cues as the sole sensory modality for prey perception with individuals performing a three-dimensional hovering (scanning) flight in front of prey on leaves while emitting short, multi-harmonic broadband calls. The authors point out that given the short distance between target and substrate, the bats should experience considerable backward masking but they speculate that the hovering in combination with the continual scanning was a key component allowing for ensonification of the target and prey perception by altering the angle between target and background. This might have the effect of reducing clutter and thus the problematic masking (<a href=\"#bib9\">Geipel et al., 2013</a>). They further speculate that at obtuse angles, the smooth leaf surface contributes to the \u2018mirror effect\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Siemers et al., 2005</a>), which increases the relative strength of the target echo over the substrate clutter echo, as the latter is mirrored away at oblique angles."

This effect, which we dub the \u2018acoustic shadow\u2019, may present fundamental mechanisms allowing bats to find a target on a surface. Interestingly, we find some evidence for acoustic shadowing even in single echo RMS amplitude measurements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Such an acoustic shadow is particularly salient if bats were forming search images (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jones, 2013</a>). Our data suggest that scanning behaviour combined with constant patch exploitation and patch fidelity may indicate that true gleaning taxa like <i>Micronycteris</i> form a perceptual construct of a predictable hunting environment and then search for disruptions of that construct. This represents a particularly powerful cue in that the bat needs only to perceive a difference in an expected surface, analogous to detecting a prey item resting on a lighter background by a local drop in brightness, rather than the full features of the prey target whose characteristics depend on size, shape, orientation, and taxon and are therefore unpredictable."

Imaging by sound as we have here gives an indication of which objects create echoes and how strong their overall contribution is. This represents a novel way to measure and interpret the spatial reflection patterns of echo-acoustic energy and is an important new tool in hypothesis generation (finding potentially new cues) and measuring echo-acoustic information in greater detail. However, a bat's image from a single call will be far less detailed (though this cannot currently be quantified). To compensate, bats may use scanning behaviour to change the echo direction slightly between calls and combine multi-aspect range profiles (impulse responses) into a 2D or 3D image through biological tomography analogues. The remaining question is whether a tomographic analogue is biologically plausible, and under realistic conditions, what levels of detail bats are able to achieve. While no behavioural experimentation has yet been conducted specific to our hypothesis, one significant clue to the biological plausibility of a tomographic analogue is the very broadband scanning behaviour of <i>Micronycteris</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Geipel et al., 2013</a>). This behaviour should provide discrimination of depth changes down to 1 mm and combined with the change in approach angle and very short pulse intervals should lead to continuous information during scanning (see an extensive discussion by <a href=\"#bib9\">Geipel et al. (2013)</a>)."

Mirror-like surfaces (e.g., leaf or slate) provide more target detection potential across all four acoustic cues we considered. This was subtle for conventional single echo cues and varied with angle but was particularly apparent in multi-aspect integrated image interpretation from tomographies, which provided a far more sensitive measure of acoustic information. This suggests a new phenomenon of acoustic camouflage. Camouflage is most commonly associated with visual concealment with a long history of study and evolutionary interest (e.g., cited as an example in The Origin of Species [<a href=\"#bib4\">Darwin, 1859</a>]). Camouflage devices include homochromy, countershading, and disruptive colouration (<a href=\"#bib20\">Robinson, 1981</a>) leading to the failure of a predator to detect prey. However, non-visual perceptual forms of camouflage are more rarely considered and are thus harder to define. In our biosonar case, \u2018rough\u2019 surfaces may create echo camouflage for prey making it virtually impossible for bats to differentiate the prey from the unpredictable signals of the surface. This may also constitute \u2018mimicry\u2019 in some cases if the bat detects the prey but dismisses the signal as part of the general variability of the surface (see a discussion of camouflage vs. mimicry in <a href=\"#bib20\">Robinson (1981)</a>). Subsequent experimentation with multiple surface gradients is clearly indicated to determine the nature of this effect."

We did not treat these as statistical outliers for biological reasons. Two of these species were hawkmoths (Sphingidae) with very unusual resting positions when wings were up, and the third was a very small butterfly with extremely thin wings. The effect of resting position may be principally hard to detect in our data due to differences in size and this is the main reason for using multiple moth species in our data set. These species were selected to cover a range of potential target sizes and densities (larger moths often have more dense wings and stronger wing venation). We suggest that in most cases, resting position does not provide a meaningful acoustic adaptation. However in some cases, such as hawkmoths, where the body is unusually large compared to the wings, which are folded very tightly when at rest, resting position may be important in detectability."

Across angles from 0 to 70\u00b0, these cues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 2\u20135</a>) showed strong correlation with and without moths present (except duration on slate). At an increasing angle of sound incidence, the echo from the closest parts of the surface arrives earlier and the most distant parts' echo later, so the overall echo duration increased as the angle moves away to either side (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). The rougher the surface, the more reflectors contribute to the echo and the greater the magnitude of increase in duration (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that the effect of the moth's presence is subtle and very difficult to detect but that mirror-like surfaces make the task easier by reflecting more information at specific angles yielding more salient cues to the bat. While we did not assess the variability of different surface types (e.g., multiple bark samples or taxa), we suggest that it is the properties of the surface rather than the actual item which matters\u2014thus, smooth surfaces like beech bark may be more acoustically similar to leaves and slate than the bark used here.

It is an area that requires considerable investigation, particularly in relation to the way we use similar radar technologies. Since we are introducing an entirely new potential cue, we can only really speculate about what is biologically meaningful. We have attempted to draw on the recorded behavior of <i>Micronycteris</i> to demonstrate how this could work, but clearly a behavioural experiment would be needed to attempt to validate this.

It is essentially a very old question: what does the bat perceive? This is very different from: what are bats capable of discriminating? This latter component is what is quite often investigated. For example, a good echolocating bat can distinguish two points only a few millimeters apart but may still attack a stone in the air as if it is prey. Clearly, \u201ccapable\u201d is not the same as \u201cmeaningful\u201d. Tomography might help solve this problem by giving us a more integrated idea of what echolocation can do.
