When complexin-1 was included, a more pronounced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion burst was observed, effectively synchronizing the process. Here we show that complexin-1 also reduces spontaneous fusion in the same assay. Moreover, distinct effects of several complexin-1 truncation mutants on spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion closely mimic those observed in neuronal cultures. The very N-terminal domain is essential for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion, but not for suppression of spontaneous fusion, whereas the opposite is true for the C-terminal domain. By systematically varying the complexin-1 concentration, we observed differences in titration behavior for spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion. Taken together, complexin-1 utilizes distinct mechanisms for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion and inhibition of spontaneous fusion."

When complexin-1 was included, a more pronounced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion burst was observed, effectively synchronizing the process. Here we show that complexin-1 also reduces spontaneous fusion in the same assay. Moreover, distinct effects of several complexin-1 truncation mutants on spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion closely mimic those observed in neuronal cultures. The very N-terminal domain is essential for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion, but not for suppression of spontaneous fusion, whereas the opposite is true for the C-terminal domain. By systematically varying the complexin-1 concentration, we observed differences in titration behavior for spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion. Taken together, complexin-1 utilizes distinct mechanisms for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion and inhibition of spontaneous fusion."

Key players are neuronal soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 (Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein), syntaxin-1A, and SNAP-25A (Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25); synaptotagmin; complexin; Munc-18/Sec1, and Munc13 (<a href=\"#bib32\">S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">S\u00fcdhof, 2013</a>). While it is well established that SNARE proteins provide the minimal energy to drive membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib35\">Weber et al., 1998</a>) and synaptotagmin-1 is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast synchronous release (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Chac\u00f3n et al., 2001</a>), the molecular mechanisms of complexin, Munc18, and Munc13 are less certain (<a href=\"#bib18\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ma et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>).

In contrast, complexin double-knockout mice showed impairment of both synchronous and spontaneous release in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib28\">Reim et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Xue et al., 2010</a>). At variance, a complexin double-knockout in <i>Drosophila</i> impaired synchronous release but enhanced spontaneous release (<a href=\"#bib39\">Xue et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Jorquera et al., 2012</a>). Overexpression of complexin-1 in PC12 cells suppressed both K<sup>+</sup>-dependent acetylcholine release (<a href=\"#bib13\">Itakura et al., 1999</a>) and evoked release in chromaffin cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Archer et al., 2002</a>).

For example, complexin-1 suppressed SNARE-mediated content-mixing in a cell-based assay, and the combination of synaptotagmin-1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> reversed this effect, albeit on a very slow time scale (<a href=\"#bib11\">Giraudo et al., 2009</a>). Complexin-1 promoted both spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered lipid mixing using a single vesicle\u2013vesicle lipid-mixing assay together with neuronal SNAREs, but, surprisingly, in the absence of synaptotagmin-1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Yoon et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, complexin-1, together with neuronal SNAREs and synaptotagmin-1, reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent lipid-mixing and it enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered lipid mixing using an ensemble assay (<a href=\"#bib24\">Malsam et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, this ensemble fluorescence study revealed enhanced lipid-mixing upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggering with a complexin-1 fragment without the N-terminal and accessory domains. Thus, this lipid-mixing result does not correlate with the observation that the N-terminus of complexin-1 is essential for activation of fast synchronous release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> in <a href=\"#bib25\">Maximov et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, our single vesicle\u2013vesicle content-mixing assay correlates well with the physiological data since the N-terminal and accessory domains are required for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). In retrospect, many previous studies suffered from the lack of a genuine content mixing indicator and the use of an ensemble method that cannot distinguish between effects due to vesicle association and fusion, see discussion in refs. (<a href=\"#bib5\">Diao et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2013c</a>). Our single vesicle\u2013vesicle content mixing assay addresses both limitations. Another single vesicle\u2013vesicle content mixing assay was also developed using a much larger probe (dual-labeled DNA hairpin) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Diao et al., 2010</a>); using this assay, accelerated fusion pore expansion by complexin-1 was observed (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lai et al., 2013</a>)."

Models of complexin function have primarily focused on a clamping or hindrance mechanism that restricts spontaneous release (<a href=\"#bib10\">Giraudo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>), along with a model that combined the clamping role with the facilitation/synchronization role of complexin-1 and, in particular, its N-terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib38\">Xue et al., 2010</a>). However, if the same mechanism would facilitate synchronization as well, one would expect identical behaviors as the concentration of complexin-1 is increased. Yet, the different titration behaviors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) suggest that there are differences in mechanisms for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion and for suppressing spontaneous fusion. Moreover, genetic manipulations of the single complexin homolog in <i>Drosophila</i> show that the suppression and synchronization functions are genetically separable, also supporting the notion of distinct mechanisms in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cho et al., 2014</a>)."

The dissociation constant of an interaction between the accessory helical domain and a partially assembled SNARE complex had been measured to be in the low \u03bcM range (<a href=\"#bib18\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>) although a re-examination of this interaction has cast doubt on the original derivation of that estimate (<a href=\"#bib34\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>). Finally, the C-terminus of complexin-1 interacts with anionic membranes, but no estimate for the affinity is available (<a href=\"#bib7\">Diao et al., 2013b</a>). In any case, the C-terminus is not essential for the synchronization function of complexin-1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

Next, we injected 500 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution, and continued monitoring for another minute, referred to as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion period. For associated SV vesicles that did not undergo spontaneous fusion during the second period, a step-wise increase in fluorescence intensity during the third period indicated a Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered fusion event. To determine the temporal arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the evanescent field of our TIR microscope setup, soluble Cy5 dye was added with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer to monitor the emergence of fluorescence intensity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, bottom panel).

Consequently, we did not observe any additional SV-PM vesicle association events during the subsequent observation periods. Upon the start of illumination and recording of the fluorescence from a particular field of view of the flow chamber, SV vesicles (diluted 100 to 1000 times) were loaded into the flow chamber to directly monitor vesicle association of SV vesicles to PM vesicles for one minute; when complexin-1 was included in a particular experiment, it was added concurrently together with the SV vesicles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

The work is technically difficult, and we have nothing but admiration for their success in doing so in this in vitro system. Using a soluble self-quenched fluorescent dye inside a vesicle that mimics the synaptic vesicles, they continuously monitor the recruitment of the vesicles (first 1 min acquisition), the spontaneous, calcium-independent fusion events (second 1 min acquisition) and the calcium-triggered fusion events triggered by injection of 500 \u00b5M calcium (third 1 min acquisition). They find that complexin increases the number of vesicles associated, suppresses spontaneous release and synchronizes calcium-triggered release. Mutations/truncation studies allow them to identify the role of different domains and these results in good agreement with previous studies done in cultured neurons. Lastly, they examine the effect of complexin concentration and report a different titration behavior for spontaneous release as compared to calcium-triggered release. Based on this they conclude that the complexin inhibits spontaneous release and calcium-triggered release via different mechanism."

In response to their concerns we performed statistical significance tests of the titrations shows in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B-D</a>. We found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synchronization and amplitude exhibits a statistically significant increase between 50 and 100 nM complexin. In contrast, there is a statistically significant decrease of spontaneous fusion between 100 and 500 nM complexin. Thus, the difference in titration behaviors for spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion is significant with a roughly ten-fold concentration difference in the most sensitive complexin concentration. Moreover, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> shows that the N-terminus, but not the C-terminus is essential for complexin\u2019s effect on synchronization, but the reverse is true for complexin\u2019s suppression of spontaneous fusion. Thus, we still feel that our data collectively suggest differences in mechanisms for these two functions. Moreover, genetic manipulations of the single complexin homolog in <i>Drosophila</i> show that the suppression and synchronization functions are genetically separable, also supporting the notion of distinct molecular mechanisms (PNAS 111, 10317-10322, 2014). Nevertheless we have softened and clarified the statements related to this point throughout the paper."

First, to avoid confusion we have changed the term \u201cvesicle buffer\u201d to \u201cbuffer V\u201d. Please note that this is buffer only, with no vesicles. Thus, after the 1 minute observation time we wash out any free vesicles. Our washing procedure was as follows: while continuing the recording the flow chamber (\u223c 3 \u03bcL) was washed three times with 120 \u03bcL of buffer V (including complexin at the specified concentration, if applicable) in order to remove unbound SV vesicles; thus each wash exchanges the sample volume roughly a hundred times. Consequently, we did not observe any additional docking events during the subsequent fusion observation periods. The normalization in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2F-G</a> and 3B-D used the number of events during the association period. Moreover, only those single vesicle-vesicle fluorescence intensity traces that exhibited a distinct event during the association period were analyzed for fusion events during the subsequent observation periods. We have added these explanations to the Materials and Methods section and the main text."
