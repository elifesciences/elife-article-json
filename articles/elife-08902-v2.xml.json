The functional interaction of visual cortical neurons and hippocampal place cells during spatial navigation behavior has yet to be elucidated. Here we show that, like hippocampal place cells, many neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of freely moving rats selectively fire at specific locations as animals run repeatedly on a track. The V1 location-specific activity leads hippocampal place cell activity both spatially and temporally. The precise activities of individual V1 neurons fluctuate every time the animal travels through the track, in a correlated fashion with those of hippocampal place cells firing at overlapping locations. The results suggest the existence of visual cortical neurons that are functionally coupled with hippocampal place cells for spatial processing during natural behavior. These visual neurons may also participate in the formation and storage of hippocampal-dependent memories."

How these cells establish the location specificity has been a subject under intensive investigation. It is known that path integration of the information generated from self-motion is important for hippocampal place cell activity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">McNaughton et al., 2006</a>). However, external sensory cues are equally important, if not more. In particular, visual cues play a pivotal role in place cell activities (<a href=\"#bib44\">Muller, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Knierim, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Colgin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ravassard et al., 2013</a>). For example, changing the proximal or distal visual cues alters firing rates and/or firing locations of place cells in a one- or two-dimensional space (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2004a</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>), and the rotation of a salient cue card on the wall of a symmetric open arena evokes an equivalent rotation of place field locations (<a href=\"#bib45\">Muller and Kubie, 1987</a>)."

Visual cues are presumably encoded and processed in the visual cortex, which is connected to the hippocampus via a multi-synaptic pathway involving the associational cortices including the entorhinal cortex (<a href=\"#bib42\">Miller and Vogt, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Vaudano et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lavenex and Amaral, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Furtak et al., 2007</a>). Computational models have shown that hippocampal cells can integrate input from cortical cells, in particular those encoding visual cues, to form a conjunctive response that is location-specific (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Araujo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schonfeld and Wiskott, 2015</a>). Alternatively, it is proposed that local visual cues influence place field location through entorhinal \u2018border\u2019 cells, whereas distal cues influence place field orientation via entorhinal \u2018head direction\u2019 cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Knierim and Hamilton, 2011</a>). Obviously, these models and others similar require the functional interaction between those visual cortical neurons encoding visual cues and corresponding hippocampal place cells. However, experimental data for such an interaction are very limited (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ji and Wilson, 2007</a>), and the nature of this interaction during natural spatial behavior remains unexplored."

We aimed to test a hypothesis that there exists a specific population of visual cortical neurons that responds to visual features of the track with specific activity patterns and functionally interacts with those hippocampal place cells representing the same track. We found that, like CA1 place cells, a large number of V1 neurons also displayed firing activities that were specific to particular locations on the track, especially around the visual landmarks. The location-specific activities of V1 neurons, on average, led those of CA1 place cells in both the spatial and temporal domains. For those V1 and CA1 cells that displayed spatially overlapping activity, their precise firing characteristics co-fluctuated every time the animal traveled through the track. These findings suggest the existence of specific V1 activities that participate in the encoding of external spaces. Given the critical role of the hippocampus in spatial memories (<a href=\"#bib52\">Scoville and Milner, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Squire, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eichenbaum et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Burgess and O\u2019Keefe, 2003</a>), these visual cells may also participate in the formation and storage of the spatial memories encoded by hippocampal place cells."

Over time rats became habituated to the task and repeatedly travelled back and forth along the two overlapping trajectories in order to maximize the number of rewards. The recording started on the very first day (Day 1) and continued for 2\u201314 days, with 20\u201360 min each day. Eight animals reached at least Day 7.

Third, using a method modified from previous studies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Henriksen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Igarashi et al., 2014</a>), we derived a normalized spatial modulation index (SMI). The reason for this additional measure was that SIc and SIr are affected by firing rate (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since V1 and CA1 cells had different firing rates, the SIc and SIr values between V1 and CA1 cells were not directly comparable. SMI was defined as the SIc (or equivalently SIr) of a cell relative to its chance-level distribution produced by the random shuffling (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). SMI does not directly quantify the location-specificity of a cell's firing activity, but provides a measure of the degree of location modulation relative to random spike trains with identical firing rate and temporal spiking patterns. SMI is therefore insensitive to firing rate. The chance-level of SMI for any given cell is zero. The median SMIs of both V1 (8.1 [3.4 15.4]) and CA1 cells (12.0 [3.3 23.2]) were much higher than zero (p &lt; 0.0001, <i>ranksum</i> test; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Finally, we defined a cell with SMI &gt;2.325 (99th percentile of the chance-level) as a \u2018location-responsive\u2019 V1 cell. We found that 81% of trajectory-active V1 cells were location-responsive on a trajectory and for comparison, 90% of the trajectory-active CA1 cells were location-responsive."

                                "text": "Next, we attempted to understand why location-responsive V1 cells had lower location-specificity than CA1 place cells. One obvious reason is that V1 cells, unlike CA1 place cells, often contained much baseline firing outside of a concentrated firing field (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). A second observation is that V1 cells often fired at multiple firing fields on a trajectory (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>), whereas many CA1 cells only exhibited one or two fields on our track (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We quantified the number and average spatial length of firing fields for location-responsive V1 cells. On average, the location-responsive V1 cells displayed nearly twice the number of firing fields as the CA1 place cells (mean \u00b1 SE for V1: 2.9 \u00b1 0.04 per trajectory, <i>N</i> = 1216 cell \u00d7 trajectories; CA1: 1.5 \u00b1 0.02 per trajectory, <i>N</i> = 2618; p &lt; 0.0001, <i>t</i>-test; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). On the other hand, the average field length of V1 cells was significantly smaller than that of CA1 cells (V1: 37.5 \u00b1 0.3 cm, <i>N</i> = 3521 fields; CA1: 47.2 \u00b1 0.4 cm, <i>N</i> = 3918; p &lt; 0.0001; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). The result shows that the relative low location-specificity in V1 cells was partially due to more firing fields, but not due to larger field sizes."

Spatial stability was the average correlation among all combinations of laps. To understand how the stability compared with the chance level, we also computed the spatial stability of each cell after the random shifting of its rate curves lap by lap. Similarly as in spatial information measures, the median spatial stability of V1 cells (0.19 [0.06 0.31], <i>N</i> = 1501 cell \u00d7 trajectories) was lower than that of CA1 cells (0.51 [0.28 0.70], <i>N</i> = 2909; p &lt; 0.0001, <i>ranksum</i> test), but significantly greater than the chance level (0.0014 [-0.0074 0.0060]; p &lt; 0.0001; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>), indicating that V1 cells responded reliably to same locations during each lap of track running."

First, we analyzed how the V1 and CA1 firing fields were distributed along the two trajectories on the track with opposite running directions. We found that V1 and CA1 fields were not equally distributed along the trajectories, but tended to increase in number close to the food wells, as shown previously for CA1 cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dupret et al., 2010</a>). V1 and CA1 field numbers also increased before and after the animals traveled through the corners of the track, referred to as landmarks, and decreased as the animals traveled through the long segment between the two middle corners (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The numbers of V1 and CA1 fields along the trajectories fluctuated together in a highly correlated fashion for both trajectories (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We quantified this observation by computing the cross-correlation between the field distribution curves of V1 and CA1 cells on each trajectory. The cross-correlograms for both trajectories had peaks not exactly at position lag 0, but at a positive position (2 cm, p &lt; 0.0001, <i>Pearson's r</i>) on one running direction and a negative position (\u22124 cm, p &lt; 0.0001) on the opposite direction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>), meaning that the number of V1 fields fluctuated ahead of the number of CA1 fields consistently on both running directions. Given the mean speed of 35 cm/s of our rats, the 2\u20134 cm leading distance is equivalent to 60\u2013120 ms of leading time. While the higher numbers of firing fields around the food wells and corners might simply reflect more sensory information available around the landmarks, the significant correlation between the field distribution curves of V1 and CA1 cells with a spatial delay suggests an interaction between these groups of cells, possibly reflecting the propagation of the landmark-related sensory information from V1 to CA1."

We observed that some V1 cells fired in front of or behind the landmarks on two opposite running directions, which we termed \u2018prospective\u2019 or \u2018retrospective\u2019 firing as in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib1\">Battaglia et al., 2004</a>). An example of V1 cell with prospective firing is shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, which was quantified by a significant peak at a positive position lag (36 cm, p &lt; 0.0001, <i>Pearson's r</i>) in the cross-correlogram between the cell's firing rate curves on the two trajectories.

The cross-correlogram peak positions of these bidirectional V1 cells display a bimodal distribution with two groups around 26 cm and \u221226 cm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), which corresponded to prospective and retrospective firing, respectively. Similarly, the peak positions of CA1 cells also show a bimodal distribution with two groups around 18 cm and \u221228 cm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This result suggests that a group of V1 cells responded to the same landmarks on both directions by either \u2018looking\u2019 ahead or back to the landmarks."

We used a normalized spike count cross-correlation (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), which is insensitive to the cells' firing rates, to quantify how the spiking activities of two cells were temporally correlated. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a> shows an example pair of V1 and CA1 cells with both having well-defined firing fields on the same trajectory, which led to a prominent peak in its normalized cross-correlogram. The peak time quantified the temporal relationship of the two cells. For individual pairs of cells, this peak, especially that with a long peak time, might just passively reflect the fact that they had firing fields on the same trajectory, not necessarily reflecting any functional interaction. However, if a large number of such pairs are collected, the distribution of their peak times may inform the temporal relationship between the V1 and CA1 activities at the population level. Among 22,969 pairs of V1 location-responsive cells and CA1 place cells, we obtained 997 highly significantly correlated pairs (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for definition) with peak correlation times within [\u22120.2, 0.2] s.

Therefore, we next focused on the possible interaction between V1 and CA1 cells with overlapping firing fields. We observed that the firing rates and firing locations of such V1 and CA1 cells fluctuated from lap to lap within their respective firing fields, and interestingly, they often fluctuated together in a correlated fashion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We quantified this observation by an analysis similar to the \u2018noise\u2019 correlation in previous studies on V1 cell correlation in primates (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zohary et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ecker et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hansen et al., 2012</a>). For a pair of cells with overlapping firing fields, we identified each cell's spikes within its firing field for each individual lap, and computed two quantities of these spikes: the (within-field) firing rate and the center of mass (COM) of their firing locations. We then obtained the lap-by-lap fluctuations in within-field firing rate (\u0394rate - the difference between a lap's firing rate and the averaged firing rate across all laps) and in COM (\u0394COM) for each cell. Finally, we computed the Pearson correlation in \u0394rate and in \u0394COM between two cells, which measures how closely the two cells varied their precise firing rate or firing location each time the animal traveled through the overlapped firing fields. Indeed, the pair of cells shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> were significantly correlated in both \u0394rate and \u0394COM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; see more examples in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We call this group \u2018non-responsive\u2019 pairs, which allowed us to test whether the co-fluctuation was specific to the location-responsive V1 and CA1 cells. We found that the overlapping pairs had significantly higher correlation in \u0394rate than both non-overlapping (correlation: 0.062 \u00b1 0.003; p &lt; 0.0001, <i>t</i>-test) and non-responsive pairs (\u22120.023 \u00b1 0.015; p &lt; 0.0001; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Similarly, the overlapping pairs had significantly higher correlation in \u0394COM than non-overlapping (correlation: 0.0005 \u00b1 0.0028; p &lt; 0.0001) and non-responsive pairs (correlation: 0.047 \u00b1 0.020; p &lt; 0.0001; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). We also computed the \u0394rate and \u0394COM correlations for CA1-CA1 cell pairs and for V1-V1 cell pairs. The results were similar: Overlapping pairs within each of the two brain areas were significantly correlated in both \u0394rate and \u0394COM and had significantly higher correlation than non-overlapping pairs and non-responsive pairs (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Taken together, the results above demonstrate a specific, precise co-fluctuation in the firing rates and COMs of V1 location-responsive cells and CA1 place cells with overlapping firing fields, suggesting a functional interaction between these cells. Remarkably, this long\u2013range interaction between cells in the distal V1 and CA1 was qualitatively similar to the local interaction within CA1 place cells."

As expected (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huxter et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Saleem et al., 2013</a>), the firing rate and COM were modulated by speed and head direction in many V1 and CA1 cells (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We quantified the modulation of both speed and head direction on \u0394rate/\u0394COM by a multi-variant linear regression and then removed the modulation to obtain the modified lap-by-lap fluctuations in firing rate/COM (modified \u0394rate/\u0394COM), which were no longer correlated with speed or head direction (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We computed the correlations in the modified \u0394rate/\u0394COM for overlapping V1-CA1 cell pairs. For the pair in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, the correlations in their modified \u0394rate and \u0394COM remained unchanged (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), although there was a modest reduction in other pairs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For the group of overlapping V1-CA1 pairs, the average correlation between the modified \u0394rate (0.14 \u00b1 0.009) remained significantly greater than 0 (p &lt; 0.0001, <i>t</i>-test), and was significantly higher than those of non-overlapping (0.018 \u00b1 0.002, p &lt; 0.0001) and non-responsive (\u22120.019 \u00b1 0.014, p &lt; 0.0001) V1-CA1 pairs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Similarly, the average correlation between the modified \u0394COM (0.13 \u00b1 0.009) was also significantly greater than 0 (p &lt; 0.0001), and was significantly higher than those of non-overlapping (\u22120.003 \u00b1 0.003, p &lt; 0.0001) and non-responsive (0.029 \u00b1 0.018, p &lt; 0.0001) V1-CA1 pairs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). From these results, we conclude that, behavioral variations cannot fully account for the correlation in the firing rate and COM of overlapping V1-CA1 cell pairs."

Our data yielded 4 such overlapping and 10 non-overlapping pairs of V1 and CA1 cells. We found that all the 4 overlapping pairs showed the same type of directionality, but only 5 of the 10 non-overlapping pairs did so whereas the other 5 showed the opposite directionality. Although the number of such bi-directional overlapping pairs is low (mainly due to the low percentage of bidirectional V1 and CA1 cells), the result is consistent with the correlated fluctuation in the firing rate and firing location between overlapping V1 and CA1 cells. In addition, CA1 cells are known to systematically shift their COMs backward lap by lap (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mehta et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2000</a>), presumably as a result of synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ekstrom et al., 2001</a>). To understand whether the observed co-fluctuation in COM between V1 and CA1 cells were related to this lap-by-lap plastic change, we examined the lap-by-lap shift in the COMs of V1 cells. Our analysis shows that, although there was a sign of backward shifting in V1 cells during the first 5 laps or so, the shift was not as robust as and much smaller than that of CA1 cells (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The result suggests that V1 firing activities are less plastic than those of CA1 cells at this short time scale of laps (<a href=\"#bib37\">McClelland et al., 1995</a>), and that the co-fluctuation between V1 and CA1 cells is not primarily driven by rapid plasticity in their firing activities."

We next analyzed how the activities of V1 location-responsive cells and CA1 place cells changed over the many days' experience of track running. We grouped the recording days to 3 different time points (T1\u2013T3): T1 included Day 1 and 2, a novel condition to the animals, in which most of the behavioral changes occurred (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), T3 included Day 6 to Day 7+, which we consider to be a familiar condition, and T2 included Days 3\u20135, an intermediate condition between novel and familiar. We examined 279 V1 and 628 CA1 cells at T1, 173 V1 and 519 CA1 cells at T2, and 212 V1 and 557 CA1 cells at T3 that were active on at least one trajectory. First, we found that there was a significant increase from T1 to T3 in the median overall firing rate of V1 cells (50% increase between T1 and T3; p &lt; 0.0001, <i>Kruskal\u2013Wallis test</i> including all data at T1, T2 and T3), but not in the median firing rate of CA1 cells (3% increase between T1 and T3; p = 0.079; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Second, there was a significant increase in the median SMI for both V1 (55% increase between T1 and T3; p &lt; 0.0001) and CA1 cells (39% increase between T1 and T3; p &lt; 0.0001; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting an experience-dependent increase in the location-specificity of V1 cells at the time scale of days. Third, we examined the correlation in \u0394rate and \u0394COM between overlapping V1-CA1 cell pairs at different time points (<i>N</i> = 244 pairs at T1, 108 pairs at T2, 174 pairs at T3). For the \u0394rate correlation, there was no significant change from T1 to T3 (2% decrease between T1 and T3; p = 0.20, <i>one-way ANOVA</i> comparing all data at T1, T2 and T3; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This is also true for the modified \u0394rate correlation after the speed and head direction modulation was removed (19% increase between T1 and T3; p = 0.13; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). For the \u0394COM correlation, there was a small, but statistically non-significant decrease from T1 to T3 (17% decrease between T1 and T3; p = 0.11, <i>one-way ANOVA</i>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). For the modified \u0394COM, the decrease was more prominent, but remained non-significant (33% decrease between T1 and T3; p = 0.088; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These data show that, although there was an indication of slightly decreased co-fluctuation between V1 and CA1 cells with experience, their functional interaction persisted as the animals became familiarized with the track. Taken together, day-to-day track experience was accompanied by an increase in the firing rate and location-specificity of V1 cells, which remained correlated in their lap-by-lap fluctuations with overlapping CA1 cells."

We determined the laminar locations of the recorded neurons on the final recording day by performing small electrolytic lesions and subsequently examining the Nissl and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We estimated the locations of those neurons recorded on previous days by relative distances tetrodes had traveled. A neuron's location was assigned to either the superficial layers 2 and 3 (L2/3), layer 4 (L4), or the deep layers 5 and 6 (L5/6). We obtained 478 cells in L2/3, 120 in L4, and 83 in L5/6 that were active on a trajectory. A small number of V1 cells (95 out of 776, 12%) were not assigned to a layer due to failed AChE staining. We first analyzed the overall firing rate and SMI among the cells recorded in different layers (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>) on all days. There was a significant difference in firing rate across the layers (p &lt; 0.0001, <i>Kruskal\u2013Wallis</i> test). The post-hoc pair-wise comparisons revealed that L4 cells had significantly higher firing rates (10.2 [6.5 14.9] Hz) than both L2/3 (3.2 [1.7 7.0] Hz, p &lt; 0.0001, <i>ranksum</i> test) and L5/6 (2.9 [1.8 6.3] Hz, p &lt; 0.0001) cells, whereas the latter two were similar (p = 0.67). The analysis of SMI shows that 86% of L2/3, 78% of L4, and 70% of L5/6 cells were location-responsive. The results indicate that L4 cells had the highest firing rate, whereas L2/3 cells had the highest percentage of location-responsive cells. Second, we computed the correlations in \u0394rate and \u0394COM for overlapping pairs of CA1 cells with the cells in each of the three cortical locations (CA1-L2/3, CA1-L4, and CA1-L5/6). We found that L2/3, L4 and L5/6 cells were similarly correlated in \u0394rate and \u0394COM with CA1 cells (data not shown). Third, we have shown that V1 cells increased their firing rates and SMIs with track running experience (T1 to T3, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Here we examined whether this was the case for cells in all layers of V1. We found a significant increase in firing rate only in L2/3 cells (p = 0.00023, <i>Kruskal\u2013Wallis</i> test comparing all data at T1, T2 and T3; 39% increase between T1 and T3), but not in L4 (p = 0.60; 2.5% increase between T1 and T3) or L5/6 cells (p = 0.10; 2.3% increase between T1 and T3; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). However, there was a significant increase in SMI from T1 to T3 for cells in all layers (L2/3: p &lt; 0.0001, 52% increase between T1 and T3; L4: p &lt; 0.0001, 130% increase between T1 and T3; L5/6: p = 0.05, 54% increase between T1 and T3; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>)."

We found that a large number of cells in all layers of V1, like CA1 place cells, fire selectively and reliably at specific locations of the track. These location-responsive V1 cells have multiple, narrow firing fields on a given trajectory of the track. The number of V1 firing fields rises and falls as animals approach and move away from visual landmarks, leading the rise and fall in the number of CA1 place fields. The precise lap-by-lap fluctuations in the firing rate and firing location of V1 cells are correlated with those of CA1 cells with overlapping firing fields. Finally, V1 cells display an experience-dependent change in their location-specificity at the time scale of days. These results reveal that V1 cells have location-specific responses to a particular environment and are functionally coupled with the hippocampal place cells encoding the same environment."

                        "text": "Our data supports a functional interaction between V1 location-responsive cells and hippocampal place cells. Here we provide three pieces of evidence. First, the number of V1 firing fields fluctuates as the animal travels through a trajectory and this fluctuation is highly correlated with the change in the number of CA1 firing fields. More interestingly, we found that the V1 fields rise and fall earlier than the CA1 fields and this leading effect is consistent on both running directions. Second, the pair-wise cross-correlation analysis reveals a bias toward positive time lags, suggesting that, again, V1 location-specific activity appears earlier than the CA1 place field activity at the population level. Third, the lap-to-lap fluctuations in the firing rates and firing locations of individual V1 cells within their firing fields are significantly correlated with those of CA1 place cells with overlapping place fields. This is true even after removing the modulation of speed and head direction on firing rate and firing location. The correlated variation is specific to CA1-V1 cell pairs with the overlapping firing fields, suggesting a remarkably precise interaction at a fine temporal and spatial scale. These observed correlations are unlikely driven by non-specific common factors because of the following reasons. First, both the field distribution and pair-wise cross-correlation analyses show that V1 activities lead CA1 activities during trajectory running. Although the lead could be caused by CA1 and V1 cells independently responding to some unknown common factors with a delay, which we cannot rule out, the lead time of 60\u2013120 ms, is consistent with our previous studies on the interaction between V1 and CA1 during slow-wave sleep (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ji and Wilson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haggerty and Ji, 2014</a>), when behavioral factors do not vary and the brain state is relatively uniform. Therefore, the delay likely reflects the propagation of activity from V1 to CA1. Second, the lap-by-lap co-fluctuation of overlapping pairs is much higher than that of non-responsive pairs. Since both types of pairs share overlapping locations, if common factors were mainly responsible, the non-responsive pairs would show correlated fluctuations comparable to those of overlapping pairs."

The location-specific activity in V1 cells does not necessarily mean that V1 cells directly respond to places per se as hippocampal place cells do. Given what we know about the primary function of V1 neurons in behaving rodents (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Niell and Stryker, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), they are likely driven by the visual cues associated with specific locations on the track, supported by our observation that V1 firing fields are more distributed around the landmarks. In particular, prospective firing may occur when V1 neurons \u2018see\u2019 landmarks in front of the animal. Retrospective firing may occur as V1 neurons \u2018see\u2019 landmarks behind the animal's head, which is possible because the side-facing eyes of rats have a wide visual field and can see visual stimuli behind or above the head (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wallace et al., 2013</a>), although other mechanisms such as feedback from the higher cortical areas or the hippocampus may also be responsible. The landmark information represented by the V1 cells can reach the hippocampus via a multi-synaptic pathway, which includes the secondary visual cortex, temporal cortex, perirhinal/postrhinal cortex, and entorhinal cortex (<a href=\"#bib42\">Miller and Vogt, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Vaudano et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lavenex and Amaral, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Furtak et al., 2007</a>).

On one hand, given the apparent modulation of hippocampal place cells by visual cues (<a href=\"#bib45\">Muller and Kubie, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2004a</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>), the response of a hippocampal cell to a particular place also contains a \u2018sensory\u2019 response to the visual cues associated with that place. In our data, the CA1 place fields are preferentially distributed around the landmarks, just as the V1 firing fields are, suggesting a bias of CA1 place cell activity by sensory input. On the other hand, the response of a V1 cell to visual clues at a particular place effectively establishes a \u2018spatial\u2019 response to the place, if the visual cues are stable in space. In this manner, the firing fields of V1 cells may appear to be similar to the CA1 place fields, with the important differences in that V1 cells exhibited less specificity by nature of non-zero baseline firing and multiple firing fields. The difference in V1 and CA1 location-specific activity is just that, because hippocampal place cell activities result from an integration of not just visual information, but also information from other sensory modalities and self-motion, hippocampal place fields are more specific and predictive of the animal's spatial location than the predominantly sensory-driven V1 firing fields. Therefore, it is possible that spatial representation in the brain may involve a gradual transformation along the anatomical pathway connecting the sensory cortex to the hippocampus, which converts a primarily sensory-driven, less reliable spatial response in the sensory cortex to a more precise and robust spatial response in the hippocampus."

If so, then the gradual transformation of spatial representation also suggests that a spatial memory trace is not only encoded by hippocampal place cells, but also by the cortical cells involved in the transformation, which are presumably distributed in many cortical areas. This idea is an essential component in many modern theories of memory, including index theory (<a href=\"#bib57\">Teyler and Rudy, 2007</a>), two-stage memory processing theory (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buzsaki, 1996</a>), and the theory of two complementary memory systems (<a href=\"#bib37\">McClelland et al., 1995</a>). All these theories propose the involvement of relevant cortical cells in long-term memory storage. Our previous study shows that activity patterns of V1 and CA1 cells during track running are coordinately replayed later during slow-wave sleep (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ji and Wilson, 2007</a>), suggesting the involvement of V1 cells in memory consolidation. The current study provides another piece of key evidence that V1 cells and CA1 place cells functionally interact during the stage of memory formation as animals run a novel track for a first week or so. In our data, the lap-by-lap co-fluctuation between V1-CA1 cell pairs with overlapping firing fields is qualitatively similar to that between pairs of CA1-CA1 place cells with overlapping place fields. Since CA1 place cells with overlapping place fields are believed to constitute functional \u2018cell assemblies\u2019 that encode the spatial memory of the animal's environment (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harris et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</a>), it is possible that the overlapping V1 location-responsive cells and hippocampal place cells are part of the larger \u2018cortical-hippocampal assemblies\u2019 that encode and store the same spatial memory trace. Therefore, we propose that the V1 location-specific activities are a substrate for encoding and storing the visual component of long-term spatial memories, and possibly episodic memories."

The rats were then placed back onto an <i>ad libitum</i> diet and went through a surgery for implanting a tetrode recording device (see below). About 4 weeks after the surgery, animals were once again food deprived and recording began as the animals were placed on a novel C-shaped track (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), in a different room from the pre-training. The track, made of metal, was \u223c3 m long and \u223c6 cm wide with 3 cm high walls. The track was surrounded by a black curtain. No additional visual cues were added to the experimental set up. The only local cues were those inherent to the C-shaped metal track with 4 corners and low walls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). During the recording, rats ran back and forth along 2 trajectories for milk remotely delivered at both ends of the track by syringe and tubing from outside the curtain. The animals were free to move along the track, but rewarded only after they reached one end from the other. The recording started on the very first day the animals experienced the track (Day 1) and continued for 2\u201314 days, with 20\u201360 min each day. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Committee on Animal Care at Baylor College of Medicine and followed National Institutes of Health guidelines."

Briefly, during the \u223c4 weeks post surgery, tetrodes were slowly moved to the CA1 and V1. Once stable single units (spikes presumably from single neurons) in CA1 were obtained, recordings started on Day 1 when the animals were introduced to the track and performed the track running task as described above. Once the recordings started on Day 1, CA1 tetrodes were never moved again on later recording days, but V1 tetrodes were moved no more than 125 \u00b5m a day to sample cells in different layers of V1. Some V1 tetrodes were already moved to deep layers before the recording started, in order to sample deep-layer cells on early days of track running. Signals recorded by each tetrode were filtered with a pass band of 600 Hz\u20139 kHz. Spikes were identified by a pre-set threshold of 50\u201370 \u00b5V and digitized at a sampling rate of 32 kHz. Two color diodes (red, green) were mounted over the animal's head to track the animals' position and head direction. Positions were sampled at 33 Hz with a resolution approximately 0.2 cm. Rat position was analyzed offline, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> position was linearized, and animal speed was calculated as the linearized spatial distance between each 2 time points."

For each tetrode, an electric current (30 \u00b5A) was passed for \u223c15 s to create a small lesion at the tip of the tetrode. Brains were fixed in 10% formalin for at least 24 hr and then sectioned at 50 \u00b5m thickness. The sections were alternatively stained with either 0.2% Cresyl violet or 1% sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>9</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O) to detect acetylcholineesterase (AChE) activity following the established protocol (see <a href=\"#bib48\">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</a> for details in procedure and the agents used). The lesion sites were verified from the lesion marks in the stained sections (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), according to the standard rat brain atlas (<a href=\"#bib48\">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</a>). At the implantation coordinates used here, area V1 is flanked laterally and medially by the secondary visual cortex V2. V1 was delineated from surrounding cortical areas by a granulized layer 4 that exhibited denser staining in the Cresyl violet and the presence of a double band of darker AChE stain restricted to V1 in layers 4 and 5. The presence of two dark AChE bands and the darker layer 4 Cresyl staining were also used to locate the laminar location of the lesion sites within V1 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zilles et al., 1984</a>). Because CA1 tetrodes were never moved during the recording days, the locations of all CA1 cells were identified by the lesion sites. The locations of V1 cells recorded on the final recording day were also the same as the lesion sites in V1. The locations of V1 cells recorded on previous days were estimated, based on the distances tetrodes traveled to the final locations. In two rats, the AChE staining procedure did not work. V1 neurons in these animals were not assigned to a layer."

Since some tetrodes ware not moved from one day to another (but could have drifted slightly overnight), it is difficult to know whether different or same cells were recorded across days from these tetrodes. Therefore, certain cells might be repeatedly sampled across days, but were included in the analysis because we would like to examine how V1 and CA1 activities changed across days (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>). A total of 852 V1 and 3627 CA1 cells were recorded. For CA1 cells, only putative pyramidal cells (firing rate &lt;5 Hz) that were active on at least one trajectory (firing rate \u22650.5 Hz) were included in the analysis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ji and Wilson, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2008</a>). For V1 cells, all active cells (firing rate &gt;0.5 Hz) were included. We did not exclude high-rate V1 cells because we did not find reliable indicators that high-rate V1 cells were a distinct cluster from low-rate V1 cells in our data. This criterion yielded a total of 776 V1 cells and 2033 CA1 cells across all the recording days, which were the basis for all of the analyses. Only the activities of these cells during active track running were analyzed. The activities at the food wells (the final \u223c10 cm at each end of the track) or during the stopping periods on the track (with running speed &lt;6 cm/s for at least 0.5 s) were excluded from the analysis. This exclusion is due to the fact that our purpose was to study the location responses of CA1 and V1 cells, but it is known that during stopping behavior CA1 cells fire in a different mode from active running and their activities become non-location-specific (<a href=\"#bib17\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cheng and Frank, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</a>).

For cells with relatively low firing rate such as CA1 cells and most V1 cells in L2/3 and L5/6, this baseline rate was close to 0. This definition of baseline was empirical. All the results in later analyses were qualitatively similar and only quantitatively affected if the baseline was defined as between 15<sup>th</sup> and 50<sup>th</sup> percentile. We subtracted the baseline from the firing rate curve and identified the peaks of the remaining curve. If a peak of the remaining curve was greater than 1 Hz and greater than 20% of the baseline rate, we counted it as a firing field and identified its boundaries as 10% of the peak rate (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mehta et al., 2000</a>). If the gap between two neighboring fields was smaller than 4 cm, the two fields were merged. This analysis was performed only on trajectory-active CA1 cells and on trajectory-active V1 cells identified as location-responsive."

The counts were then smoothed by a Gaussian window with a sigma of 2 bins. Cross-correlograms between firing field distribution curves (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) or between firing rate curves (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) were computed similarly as in <a href=\"#equ3\">Equation 3</a> at each position lag of 2 cm.

Cross-correlation between two cells' spiking activities (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) was computed as a normalized spike count correlation. Given two spike trains made of <i>M</i>, <i>N</i> spikes, <b><i>P</i></b> = [<i>P</i><sub><i>1</i></sub>, <i>P</i><sub><i>2</i></sub>, \u2026, <i>P</i><sub><i>M</i></sub>] and <b><i>Q</i></b> = [<i>Q</i><sub><i>1</i></sub>, <i>Q</i><sub><i>2</i></sub>, \u2026, <i>Q</i><sub><i>N</i></sub>], and a time bin size <i>B,</i> for each time lag <i>\u2206T</i> and for each spike <i>P</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> (<i>i = 1, 2, ..., M</i>) in <b><i>P</i></b>, we counted the number of spikes in <b><i>Q</i></b> that were within [<i>P</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><i>+\u2206T-B/2 P</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><i>+\u2206T + B/2</i>].

Similar to previous studies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sirota et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Siapas et al., 2005</a>), this normalized spike count correlation is not sensitive to firing rate. The cross-correlogram was the cross-correlation vs the time lag. <i>B</i> was set as 10 ms.

An overlapping pair was defined as a pair of cells that (i) at least one firing field of a cell overlapped spatially with a field of another cell by at least 50%, and (ii) their cross-correlogram had a dominant peak with peak correlation \u22658 and peak time within [\u2212200, 200] ms. The criterion in the cross-correlogram was to exclude those pairs with only a minor portion of spikes fired within their overlapping fields. For a given cell pair with overlapping firing fields on a trajectory and for each lap, we identified the spikes of each cell within each cell's corresponding overlapped field. If a pair had multiple overlapped firing fields, we only analyzed the spikes within the most dominant pair of overlapping fields (the one with the maximum sum of peak rates). We then computed the firing rate and the mean firing location (center of mass\u2014COM) of the spikes for each cell and for each lap within the overlapped firing fields. For each cell, the firing rate/COM fluctuation (\u0394rate/\u0394COM) for a lap was the difference between the lap's firing rate/COM and the average firing rate/COM across all the laps.

In this case, the lap-by-lap firing rate and COM were computed within their dominant firing fields (the one with the highest peak rate). The non-overlapping pairs served as a control group to test whether the correlated fluctuation was spatially confined within overlapping firing fields. A pair of cells was considered a non-responsive pair if one cell was location-responsive and had place fields on a trajectory while the other was not location-responsive. The non-responsive pairs served as a control group to test whether the correlated fluctuation was limited to location-responsive cells. For non-responsive pairs, the lap-by-lap fluctuations were computed within the dominant firing field for the location-responsive cell, and for the non-responsive cell within a randomly generated spatial interval that was overlapped with the field by a random percentage between 50%and 100%."

The authors report that V1 cells have spatially related responses, and that their activity seems to be related to the spatially-selective activity of CA1 neurons. The main arguments supporting the link between visual cortex and hippocampal activity are a similar distribution of \u201cplace field\u201d peaks, the existence of fine scale temporal correlations captured by the cross-correlogram, and the co-variability of firing rate and field center of mass across runs. This is a very interesting study that builds upon an earlier study by <a href=\"#bib27\">Ji and Wilson (2007)</a> that showed place-specific firing in V1 that was coordinated with place cell firing in CA1 during waking and sleep. Although the present findings are not as novel as the authors imply, due to some overlap with the previous Ji and Wilson study, there is still much new and interesting information provided in this paper. Nonetheless, there are some issues that should be resolved prior to publication."

The measure is perfectly fine in my opinion to determine if an information score is significant or not, but when comparing different populations, the denominator (the variance in the surrogate data) may be different, just due to the different structure of the firing rate map. In any event, the result is quite inconclusive, and I suggest removing it."

In light of the reviewer #2\u2019s comment (see below), comparing SMIs across different cell populations is problematic, but using SMI to detect the percentage of location-specific cells in a population is valid. Therefore, following reviewer #2\u2019s suggestion, we have dropped the SMI comparison across the layers, but kept the percentage of location-specific cells in each layer. We found 86% of layer 2/3 cells, 78% of layer 4 cells, and 70% of layer 5/6 cells contained significant spatial information, which makes more sense in a way that more cells in the output layer (layer 2/3) are location-specific than the input layer (layer 4) and the feedback layer (layer 5/6). However, we feel like we really do not have a clear idea why these cells are distributed this way. Although this is not a key result and does not affect our conclusion, it is a useful piece of information for readers and future studies (we have also expanded this analysis to address the reviewer #2\u2019s comment below). Therefore, we report the result as a matter of fact (in the subsection \u201cLayer differences in V1 firing activities\u201d and in a new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) without further elaboration."

We have modified the wording in the Results (subsection \u201cLap-by-lap co-fluctuation of V1 and CA1 firing activities \u201c) to remove the confusion.

However, we only obtained 4 overlapping pairs and 10 non-overlapping pairs with both cells showing bi-directionality. The low numbers of pairs are due to the low percentage of bidirectional cells (\u223c10% of V1 and CA1 cells) in our data. Nevertheless, all the 4 overlapping pairs showed same type of bi-directionality, whereas half of the non-overlapping pairs showed the same type and the other half showed the opposite. We also tried to relax our definition of overlapping pairs (by lessening the required percentage of overlap), but did not obtain substantially more pairs. Although the analysis is not conclusive due to low numbers of pairs, it is consistent with the results of our co-fluctuation analysis.

Therefore, we feel uncomfortable to use an identifier to indicate which cells were repeatedly measured across days. But rather, we treated cells recorded on different days in a given area/layer as longitudinal samples from the same population with replacements. This treatment is a more conservative way of analysis, which does not take advantage of the repeated measure design in, e.g., ANOVA, and tends to yield a less significant p value. The analysis mainly applies to the experience-dependent changes of V1 and CA1 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).
