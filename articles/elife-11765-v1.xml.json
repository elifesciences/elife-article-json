We show that the modification of Ovalbumin (OVA) with the glycan-structure Lewis<sup>X</sup> (Le<sup>X</sup>) re-directs OVA to the C-type lectin receptor MGL1. Le<sup>X</sup>-modification of OVA favored Th1 skewing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. While cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen dose and TLR stimuli, Le<sup>X</sup> modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and obviates its dependence on TLR signaling. The OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-induced enhancement of T cell cross-priming is MGL1-dependent as shown by reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cell frequencies in MGL1-deficient mice. Moreover, MGL1-mediated cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> neither required TAP-transporters nor Cathepsin-S and was still observed after prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments. We conclude that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can crucially influence intracellular routing of antigens, the nature and strength of immune responses and should be considered for optimizing current vaccination strategies."

                    "text": "Antigen uptake by dendritic cells and intracellular routing of antigens to specific compartments is regulated by C-type lectin receptors that recognize glycan structures. We show that the modification of Ovalbumin (OVA) with the glycan-structure Lewis<sup>X</sup> (Le<sup>X</sup>) re-directs OVA to the C-type lectin receptor MGL1. Le<sup>X</sup>-modification of OVA favored Th1 skewing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. While cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen dose and TLR stimuli, Le<sup>X</sup> modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and obviates its dependence on TLR signaling. The OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-induced enhancement of T cell cross-priming is MGL1-dependent as shown by reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cell frequencies in MGL1-deficient mice. Moreover, MGL1-mediated cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> neither required TAP-transporters nor Cathepsin-S and was still observed after prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments. We conclude that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can crucially influence intracellular routing of antigens, the nature and strength of immune responses and should be considered for optimizing current vaccination strategies."

The dendritic cells take up molecules called antigens from these threats and then display them on their surface. This enables the antigens to be identified by other immune cells that are capable of killing the viruses and the tumor cells. The dendritic cells recognize the antigens with the help of receptor proteins called C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). These receptors can bind to sugar molecules that are naturally found on many antigens. For example, a C-type lectin receptor called MGL1 can bind to sugars known as Lewis<sup>X</sup> and Lewis<sup>a</sup> on tumor and virus proteins.

Loading of exogenously-derived antigens onto MHC class I molecules, a process known as cross-presentation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Carbone and Bevan, 1990</a>) is required to activate antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

The relative composition of the glycosylation machinery, which includes all the necessary glycosylation-related enzymes and co-factors, determines the final configuration of the glycan structures that decorate <i>N</i>- or <i>O</i>-linked glycosylation sites present in glycoproteins. The glycosylation machinery can be affected by multiple physio-pathological cues, including proliferation, activation, and the transformation status of the cell (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006</a>), and depends on environmental factors. APC, such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are able to sense glycans exposed on either self- or pathogen-derived antigens via glycan-binding proteins. Amongst these glycan-binding proteins are C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that recognize defined carbohydrate-structures through their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Depending on the amino acid sequence, the CRD bears specificity for mannose, fucose, galactose, sialylated-, or sulfated structures. CLRs function both as antigen uptake and/or signaling receptors that modify DC-induced cytokine responses thereby influencing T cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib56\">van and Rabinovich, 2008</a>). The specialized internalization motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of CLRs allow the rapid internalization of antigens upon interaction (<a href=\"#bib19\">Engering et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Herre et al., 2004</a>). This suggests that DCs use CLRs to 'sense' the natural glycan composition of tissues and invading pathogens and, in response to this recognition, are able to modulate immune responses (<a href=\"#bib21\">Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009</a>)."

Importantly, cross-presentation of OVA was only effective using high amounts of antigen (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burgdorf et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Burgdorf et al., 2008</a>). The interaction of OVA with MR, which has specificity for mannose (<a href=\"#bib51\">Taylor et al., 1992</a>), was speculated to be dependent on the presence of mannose glycans on OVA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burgdorf et al., 2007</a>). In the current study, we investigated the effect of modifying the glycan composition of OVA on the efficacy of cross-presentation, priming and differentiation of T cells. We hypothesized that modification of the antigen with specific glycans would re-direct antigens to other CLRs resulting in altered intracellular routing and presentation of antigen and Th differentiation. We have chosen to conjugate the carbohydrate structure Lewis<sup>X</sup> (Le<sup>X</sup>) to 2 free cysteine residues within the native OVA glycoprotein. Le<sup>X</sup> is a ligand of the murine C-type lectin macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL)-1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Singh et al., 2009b</a>), which is expressed on murine plasmacytoid DC, CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>-</sup> splenic DC, DC in the small intestines, the sub-capsular and intra-follicular sinuses of T cell areas in lymph nodes, and on DC and macrophages in the dermis of skin (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dupasquier et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tsuiji et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Denda-Nagai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Segura et al., 2010</a>). Murine MGL1 is one of two homologues (MGL1 and MGL2) of human MGL (huMGL), which has been shown to interact with tumor cells through glycans exposed on MUC1 as well as with various pathogens (<a href=\"#bib59\">van Vliet et al., 2008</a>). However, MGL1 and MGL2 bind different glycan structures: while MGL1 binds Le<sup>X</sup> and Le<sup>a</sup> glycans, MGL2 binds <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and galactose glycan structures (<a href=\"#bib49\">Singh et al., 2009b</a>). The YENF motif in the cytoplasmic tail of huMGL is essential for uptake of soluble antigens, which are subsequently presented to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">van Vliet et al., 2007</a>). Murine MGL1 contains a similar motif (YENL) in its cytoplasmic tail, which likely plays a similar and important role in antigen uptake (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yuita et al., 2005</a>). Glycan binding to the CLRs DC-SIGN, Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 has been demonstrated to trigger the signaling capacity of these receptors, modulating DC-mediated T helper cell (Th) differentiation and cytokine production by DCs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009</a>). This illustrates that glycan epitopes may not only improve antigen presentation, but may also affect Th differentiation and shape specific adaptive immune responses. This is underlined by the observation that DC-SIGN signaling induced upon sensing of specific mannose or fucose structures on pathogens differentially directed Th differentiation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gringhuis et al., 2014</a>)."

Cross-presentation was associated with prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> vesicles.

We determined the glycan profile of OVA by normal-phase HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with an intercalated fluorescence detector. We found that the majority of glycan species on OVA corresponded to the complex-type (54.9%), while mannose-rich glycans (mainly Man5 and Man6, potential ligands of the MR (<a href=\"#bib52\">Taylor and Drickamer, 1993</a>)) represented only 23% of all glycoforms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The remaining glycoforms were of the hybrid (16.2%) and oligomannose (Man3, 3%) type. The presence of mannose rich glycans on OVA correlate with the earlier reports that in particular MR interacted with OVA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burgdorf et al., 2006</a>) and mediated the TLR dependent and TAP-1 dependent cross-presentation of OVA (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burgdorf et al., 2008</a>).

Since the ER-MP23 antibody does not discriminate between the two murine MGL homologues MGL1 and MGL2, MGL1 expression in wild type (WT) CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs was confirmed using qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

                                "text": "Since we observed that Le<sup>X</sup>-modified OVA increased priming of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells we examined whether this also enhanced antigen-presentation to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Both OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-loaded and native OVA-loaded spDCs induced CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cell proliferation to a similar extent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), illustrating that the altered antigen uptake mediated by Le<sup>X</sup> did not affect loading on MHC class II molecules. Similar results were obtained using BM-DCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Although we did not observe any differential effect of Le<sup>X</sup> on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion, neoglycosylation of antigens could induce signaling via CLRs and herewith potentially influence Th cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gringhuis et al., 2014</a>). We therefore investigated whether OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> affected the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Hereto BM-DCs and spDCs of C57BL/6 mice were pulsed with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> and subsequently co-cultured with naive CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>hi</sup> OT-II cells. Co-cultures containing OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> loaded BM-DCs or spDCs contained significantly more IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells than those containing OVA-loaded DCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Neither induction of IL-4- nor IL-17A-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, upper and middle panel and data not shown). In addition, induction of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells was not detected (data not shown). To exclude that the Th1 skewing by OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> loaded DCs was attributed to the more Th1 prone status of C57BL/6 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gervais et al., 1984</a>), we also performed the Th-differentiation assay with cells derived from Th2 prone BALB/c mice (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hsieh et al., 1995</a>). We observed that naive OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from DO11.10 Tg mice that were stimulated with OVA-loaded BM-DCs differentiated into IL-4 secreting T cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, lower panels). However, the generation of IL-4-producing T cells was not influenced by loading DCs with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> as these cultures contained comparable percentages of IL-4-producing DO11.10\u2009T cells. Using these Th2-prone T cells, OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-pulsed DCs still induced considerably more IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than native OVA-pulsed DCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, lower panel). Since this assay takes three days longer than the antigen-presentation assay, it is possible that the higher frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is due to increased division of OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. However we found that the amount of proliferation of OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by stimulation with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-loaded DCs after 6 days is similar to that induced by OVA-loaded DCs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The augmented induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells was also observed in vivo as revealed from the higher frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleens of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> immunized mice than in mice immunized with native OVA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data indicate that the increased numbers of Th1 cells induced by OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-loaded DC are not due to increased proliferation of OT-II cells, but probably due to MGL1-mediated signaling."

The internalization of OVA by BM-DC was significantly increased when OVA was modified with Le<sup>X</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4A\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To investigate whether the addition of Le<sup>X</sup> glycans affected the efficiency of cross-presentation of OVA by DC, we loaded murine BM-DC or spDC with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> and measured their potency to present OVA-derived peptides in MHC class I by measuring the proliferation of OVA-specific OT-I T cells. Strikingly, both BM-DCs as well as spDCs induced substantially more proliferation of OT-I T cells when they were pulsed with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> compared to native OVA (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4B\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Even at low concentrations of antigen (<i>i.e.</i> 7.5 \u00b5g/ml), the proliferating OT-I T cells were doubled (26.7% to 51.7%) using OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> compared to using OVA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that the modification of OVA with Le<sup>X</sup> greatly affected the cross-presentation of OVA. Moreover, detection of SIINFEKL/H-2K<sup>b</sup> complexes on the cell membrane of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-loaded DCs by staining with the 25.1D1 antibody confirmed enhanced antigen loading on MHC-I molecules and transportation to the cell-surface of internalized OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> compared to native OVA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> + Figure supplement 3). Cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> was clearly mediated by MGL1 as demonstrated using MGL1 KO BM-DCs or steady-state spDCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

The observed differences in cross-presentation between OVA and OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> were not due to any potential contamination with the TLR4 ligand LPS, as both protein preparations did not trigger IL-8 production by TLR4-transfected HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In addition, both OVA preparations neither induced maturation of BM-DCs nor altered their cytokine production (data not shown). To exclude any potential role of TLR signaling on the MGL1-mediated cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>,\u00a0we made use of BM-DCs from mice that lack both MyD88 and TRIF (<i>i.e.</i> MyD88/TRIF DKO). However, MyD88/TRIF DKO BM-DCs still induced more OT-I proliferation when targeted with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> than with OVA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and only a slight reduction of cross-presentation was observed compared to that induced by WT BM-DCs, suggesting a minor role for MyD88- or TRIF-signaling in MGL1-induced cross-presentation. In line with previous findings, neither exogenous loading of MHC-I molecules with OVA257-264 peptides (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) nor MHC class II presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> and OVA was dependent on MyD88- or TRIF- signaling and resulted in comparable expansion of OVA-specific T cells (data not shown)."

To study a role for TAP transporters in our model, BM-DCs of TAP1 KO and WT control mice were pulsed with OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> followed by incubation with OT-I T cells. Surprisingly, cross-presentation induced by OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> was not reduced by the absence of TAP as OT-I proliferation induced by OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-loaded TAP1 KO BM-DCs was not decreased compared to OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>-loaded WT BM-DC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In accordance with previous publications (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burgdorf et al., 2008</a>), we showed that the\u00a0administration of OVA with LPS is cross-presented in a TAP-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, the possibility that the results are confounded by reduced levels of MHC-class I on TAP1 KOBM-DCs were excluded as the presentation of exogenously loaded OVA257-264 peptide is equal by both WT and TAP1 KOBM-DCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In addition, we excluded the involvement of the Cathepsin-S pathway for cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> as cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> by BM-DCs from Cathepsin-S KO mice (Cat-S KO) was not reduced compared to WT BM-DCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). As expected, the MHC-class II-restricted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation was compromised in the Cat-S KO BM-DCs (data not shown), illustrating the involvement of Cathepsin-S in cleaving the invariant chain of the MHC-class II molecule (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nakagawa et al., 1999</a>)."

We therefore used imaging flow cytometry, a method that allows high-throughput image analysis of cells in flow with near-confocal resolution to analyze the intracellular routing of fluorescent labeled OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>. Co-staining with markers for early endosomal (EEA-1), late endosomal/lysosomal (LAMP1) and recycling endosomal (Rab11) compartments illustrated a swift co-localization of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> with EEA1 and Rab11 as shown by high co-localization scores at 15\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, this co-localization score was strongly decreased at 60\u2009min. At this time-point, higher co-localization scores were detected for OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> with LAMP1 and Rab11 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We then further dissected the intracellular pathway of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> using confocal laser scan microscopy (CLSM) and compared it to the intracellular routing of native OVA. We confirmed that native OVA, which internalized via MR, was routed to EEA1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments within 2h (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, upper-left panel and [<a href=\"#bib12\">Burgdorf et al., 2008</a>]). However, the neoglycosylation with Le<sup>X</sup> altered the intracellular routing of OVA, showing its presence predominantly within LAMP1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, upper-right panel). Moreover, OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> internalized by BM-DC from MGL1 KO mice was routed to EEA1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments and did not end up in LAMP1<sup>+</sup>Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartments, similar to OVA in WT BM-DC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lower panels + <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Together, these data suggest that upon internalization, OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> is rapidly shuttled to Rab11<sup>+</sup>EEA1<sup>+</sup> compartments from where it moves to Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments, where it persists for longer periods (<i>i.e.</i> &gt;24h). Thus, these results indicate that internalization via MGL1 allows the antigen to enter the endosomal/lysosomal pathway."

Moreover, targeting OVA to MGL1 through the conjugation of Le<sup>X</sup>, substantially enhanced cross-presentation as revealed by the increased frequency of OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells in vitro and in vivo.

A common denominator in some of these studies is that the use of antibody\u2013antigen conjugates could potentially induce a different signal than the natural ligand, due to binding to different part of the receptor or through co-engagement of Fc-receptors. The fact that the addition of Le<sup>X</sup> glycans to OVA obviates the need for TLR signals for the induction of cross-presentation and Th1 priming in vitro, may indicate that MGL1 signaling is involved in these processes. Some CLR, like DC-SIGN, Clec9A and Dectin-1 are known to induce signaling after triggering by their natural ligands (<a href=\"#bib21\">Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sancho et al., 2009</a>). Till now, no signaling pathway has been described for MGL1. Triggering of huMGL resulted in ERK1/2 and NF-\u03baB activation, and results in elevated levels of IL-10 and TNF (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">van Vliet et al., 2013</a>). In our studies, the uptake of Le<sup>X</sup>-modified OVA through MGL1 was not associated with any DC maturation or altered cytokine production by DCs. The fact that OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> induced an enhanced frequency of Th1 cells in vitro and of antigen-specific effector T cells in vivo when combined with agonistic anti-CD40 Abs illustrates that a yet to be determined costimulatory signal is essential for the induction of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This powerful function of MGL1 to establish antigen-specific immunity, stands opposite to its recently demonstrated anti-inflammatory function, which include induction of IL-10 production and altered adhesive function by APC (<a href=\"#bib40\">Saba et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Westcott et al., 2009</a>)."

The 'cytosolic pathway'\u00a0of cross-presentation allows receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis and antigen translocation into the cytosol, where they are degraded into antigenic peptides by the proteasome and transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kovacsovics-Bankowski and Rock, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shen et al., 2004</a>) or ER/phagosomal fusion compartments (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guermonprez et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Houde et al., 2003</a>) by TAP-transporters. A variation to the cytosolic pathway was described in which soluble OVA is taken up via the MR and is supplied to stable early endosomal compartments (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burgdorf et al., 2007</a>). In these compartments, the MHC class I machinery as well as TAP-transporters are selectively recruited, facilitating direct loading of antigen-derived peptides onto MHC class I molecules without trafficking to the ER. The 'vacuolar pathway' allows antigens to be degraded into peptides in early endosomal compartments by endosomal proteases like Cathepsin-S, to be loaded on MHC class I molecules in the same compartment, thus is TAP-independent (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shen et al., 2004</a>). The current described models for cross-presentation depend on peptide-transport by TAP from the cytosol to either ER or ER/phagosomal fusion compartments or on endosomal degradation of antigens via Cathepsin-S (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib3\">Amigorena and Savina, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Burgdorf and Kurts, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mintern et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Adiko et al., 2015</a>]). Although we observed localization of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup> in early endosomes, absence of either TAP molecules or Cathepsin-S did not influence the enhanced cross-presentation of OVA-Le<sup>X</sup>. Our data indicate that the MGL1 cross-presentation pathway is different than that of the MR and may occur via antigen storage compartments similar to those described for Fc\u03b3R-targeted antigens (<a href=\"#bib57\">van Montfoort et al., 2009</a>). We observed prolonged presence in Rab11<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments in the absence of a maturation stimulus or apparent DC maturation. It is tempting to speculate that in these compartments cross-presentation of OVA is facilitated by Rab11 as it was recently shown that Rab11 activity mediates delivery of MHC-I molecules to phagosomes used for cross-presentation during infection (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nair-Gupta et al., 2014</a>). However, recruitment of additional components involved in antigen cross-presentation by the SNARE Sec22b40 complex cannot be excluded (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cebrian et al., 2011</a>). The prolonged antigen cross-presentation via MGL1 allows sustained cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vivo and thus the efficacy of tumor vaccines that target MGL1 may be higher than of conventional vaccines containing non-targeted antigens."

Others have demonstrated that native OVA can only be cross-presented when a high dose was used (0.5\u20131.0 mg/ml) and when accompanied with TLR-triggering (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burgdorf et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Segura et al., 2009</a>). Although the glycan-modification was associated with increased antigen uptake and enhanced cross-presentation, it did not result in enhanced presentation of antigen on MHC-class II indicating that increased uptake of antigen is not per se a requirement to facilitate MHC class I and II presentation. Therefore, it is most likely that the CLR (and thus the glycosylation of the antigen) dictates how efficiently an antigen is cross-presented. Based on our study, MGL1 cross-presents antigen much more efficiently than the MR."

Upon malignant transformation glycan profiles may change dramatically. Le<sup>X</sup> carbohydrate structures are described to be expressed in the brain (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lieberoth et al., 2009</a>), and can be <i>de novo</i> expressed on cancer stem cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Read et al., 2009</a>) or pathogens, and the glycosylation pattern of in vivo accumulating antigens, being brain tissue, tumor tissue or pathogen structure, is crucial for directing specific CLR antigen uptake and cross-presentation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hittelet et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ohana-Malka et al., 2003</a>). Although in our studies only two Le<sup>X</sup> glycans were conjugated to each OVA molecule, it cannot be ruled out that multivalent presentation of Le<sup>X</sup>, such as often observed on tumors or pathogens (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bergman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Saeland and van, 2011</a>), may alter avidity-induced MGL-1 signaling and antigen presentation, and induce an anti-inflammatory immune repertoire. At this stage, we do not know whether high glycan valency further enhances or inhibits the MGL1-mediated (cross-)priming."

Therefore, the use of glycans for targeting CLR for anti-cancer immunotherapy could have several advantages. First, they mimic natural function of the receptors, inducing \u2018natural\u2019 signaling cascades in DCs. Furthermore, they are very small molecules, easy to use and relatively cheap to produce. Importantly, many glycans may be considered self-antigens, in contrast to recombinant antibodies that are often not completely of human origin. These properties make it possible to decorate any antigen of choice with glycans to target specific receptors."

The use of the Lewis<sup>x</sup> (Le<sup>x</sup>) modified OVA as an antigen, with the advantage of selective and specific Le<sup>x</sup> addition to two know cysteine residues is a creative and informative approach. Le<sup>x</sup> is a physiologically relevant glycosylation that is often found in infected cells and transformed cells. Specifically, the authors show that dendritic cells express MGL-1, the receptor for Le<sup>x</sup> glycosylated molecules and that promotes an increased Ova-Le<sup>x</sup> uptake and eventual processing that leads to CD8 T cell priming. The authors claim this is due to enhanced presentation of the relevant Kb/SIINFEKL complex following Ova-Le<sup>x</sup> uptake compared to its native ovalbumin counterpart. The authors also claim that Le<sup>x</sup> modification redirects routing of ovalbumin into the endolysosomal compartment where the antigen is available for MHC-I and -II presentation for at least 48h, the consequence of which is OVA-Le<sup>x</sup> induced enhanced Th1 cell differentiation."
