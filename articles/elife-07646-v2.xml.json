An enigmatic feature of many conserved mammalian miRNA target sites is that an adenosine (A) nucleotide opposite miRNA nucleotide-1 confers enhanced target repression independently of base pairing potential to the miRNA. In this study, we show that human Argonaute2 (Ago2) possesses a solvated surface pocket that specifically binds adenine nucleobases in the 1 position (t1) of target RNAs. t1A nucleotides are recognized indirectly through a hydrogen-bonding network of water molecules that preferentially interacts with the N6 amine on adenine. t1A nucleotides are not utilized during the initial binding of Ago2 to its target, but instead function by increasing the dwell time on target RNA. We also show that N6 adenosine methylation blocks t1A recognition, revealing a possible mechanism for modulation of miRNA target site potency."

An enigmatic feature of many conserved mammalian miRNA target sites is that an adenosine (A) nucleotide opposite miRNA nucleotide-1 confers enhanced target repression independently of base pairing potential to the miRNA. In this study, we show that human Argonaute2 (Ago2) possesses a solvated surface pocket that specifically binds adenine nucleobases in the 1 position (t1) of target RNAs. t1A nucleotides are recognized indirectly through a hydrogen-bonding network of water molecules that preferentially interacts with the N6 amine on adenine. t1A nucleotides are not utilized during the initial binding of Ago2 to its target, but instead function by increasing the dwell time on target RNA. We also show that N6 adenosine methylation blocks t1A recognition, revealing a possible mechanism for modulation of miRNA target site potency."

To make a protein, the gene is used as a template to make a type of RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), which is subsequently \u2018translated\u2019 into a protein. Most genes do not need to produce proteins all of the time, and so cells have several ways of stopping proteins from being made.

RNA molecules are made up of a sequence of building blocks known as nucleotides, each of which can only bind to one other type of nucleotide. If part of the nucleotide sequence of a microRNA molecule corresponds with part of the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA, the two RNA molecules will bind to each other. This enables the microRNA and the Argonaute protein to prevent the mRNA being translated. If the mRNA has an adenine nucleotide in a particular position (called \u2018t1\u2019) near the binding region in the mRNA sequence, Argonaute proteins will prevent translation more effectively. An adenine nucleotide in the t1 position is also known as a t1A nucleotide."

Over two thousand unique human miRNA sequences have been reported and more than half of all protein-coding human genes are predicted to contain a conserved miRNA recognition site (<a href=\"#bib11\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011</a>). miRNAs function as guides for Argonaute proteins, which use the sequence information encoded in each miRNA to identify complementary sties in mRNAs targeted for repression (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Meister et al., 2004</a>).

Examination of regulatory elements in fly mRNAs then revealed a striking degree of complementarity to the 5\u2032 ends of subset of conserved miRNAs, suggesting that base paring interactions with nucleotides towards the 5\u2032 end of the miRNA are particularly important for target recognition (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lai, 2002</a>). Indeed, phylogenetic analysis showed that pairing to the miRNA \u2018seed region\u2019 (nt 2\u20137 or 2\u20138, from the miRNA 5\u2032 end) is the most evolutionarily conserved feature of miRNA targets in animals (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lewis et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brennecke et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Krek et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>), and complementarity to the miRNA seed is generally sufficient to elicit significant levels of target recognition and repression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Doench and Sharp, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brennecke et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lim et al., 2005</a>). Careful comparison of miRNA seed-matched sites in the 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of human, mouse, rat, dog, and chicken genomes also revealed that an adenosine (A) nucleotide opposite miRNA nucleotide-1 is a conserved feature of many vertebrate miRNA target sites (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>). These t1A nucleotides confer enhanced repression of miRNA targets beyond pairing to the seed region alone (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nielsen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baek et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Selbach et al., 2008</a>). Curiously, unlike the seed-matched region, t1A nucleotides function independently of the identity of miRNA nucleotide-1, indicating that t1A recognition occurs through a mechanism that is distinct from base pairing with the miRNA guide (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nielsen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baek et al., 2008</a>)."

These structures revealed that Ago2 cradles the duplex formed by miRNA nucleotides 2\u20137 and the complementary target RNA, explaining why seed pairing is critical for recognition of miRNA target sites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We also noted that t1A nucleotides interact with a surface pocket formed at the interface of the L2 and MID domains of Ago2, and proposed that this additional interaction may contribute to the affinity of Ago2 for miRNA target sites. However, the t1-nucleotide binding pocket is large enough to accommodate any of the four natural RNA bases, and the contacts between Ago2 and t1A appear to be almost entirely non-specific (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Therefore, it is not clear how A nucleotides in the t1 position of miRNA targets are recognized and confer enhanced repression. In this study, we show that the t1-nucleotide binding pocket in Ago2 preferentially interacts with A nucleotides through water-mediated contacts to adenosine N6 amine. Adding a methyl group to the t1A N6 amine reduces target affinity, raising the possibility that adenosine methylation could, in principle, lead to partial derepression of miRNA targets containing 7mer-A1 or 8mer sites. We also present data indicating that t1A is not used in the initial search for target sites, but instead provides an anchor that helps retain Ago2 on seed-matched sites on target RNAs."

The overall conformation of Ago2 is nearly identical in the four different t1 structures, indicating that identity of the t1 nucleotide does not affect the structure of the protein. Inspection of target RNA omit maps, in which the target RNAs were excluded from refinement, revealed little or no well-defined electron density for all of the non-A nucleotides, indicating that the non-A t1 nucleotides were mostly disordered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In contrast, the target omit map from the t1A data set had clearly defined density for the t1A inside the t1-nucleotide binding pocket. Moreover, although residual electron density was observed for t1G and t1C nucleotides, binding experiments using the same target RNAs show that these interactions do not contribute substantially to target affinity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We conclude that, although the t1-binding site is large enough to accommodate any of the four natural RNA bases, adenine is the only nucleobase that associates stably enough to contribute to overall target affinity."

Therefore, the mechanism by which Ago2 distinguishes the t1A purine ring from t1G is unclear. Two major differences between adenine and guanine are: position-6, where adenine has an exocyclic amine, and guanine has a carbonyl; and position-2, where guanine has an exocyclic amine, and adenine has no substituent group (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We dissected the influence of these two elements on t1-binding by examining interactions with target RNAs with either inosine (I) or 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP) in the t1 position. DAP has an N6 amine (like adenine), and an N2 amine (like guanine). Conversely, inosine has an O6 carbonyl (like guanine), but lacks an N2 amine (like adenine). Ago2 bound the t1I target with an affinity similar to t1G (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) and no electron density was observed for the t1I nucleotide target omit maps, indicating that removal of the guanine N2 amine is insufficient to promote interactions with the t1-binding site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In contrast, we observed unambiguous electron density for the t1DAP nucleotide, which bound Ago2 in the same position and <i>anti</i> conformation as t1A (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Moreover, the affinity of the t1DAP target is \u223c1.7-fold greater than that of the equivalent t1A target, indicating that Ago2 has a modest, though significant, preference for t1DAP over t1A (p-value = 0.0025; two-tailed, unpaired Student's <i>t</i>-test). We conclude that the purine N6 and N2 amines both have positive effects on t1-binding, and that the N6 amine is the major determinant for distinguishing the t1A purine ring from tG. Consistent with this idea, adding a methyl group to the t1A N6 amine reduced target affinity to that of a non-t1A target (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

                                "text": "The only direct contact between the t1A N6 amine and Ago2 is a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Ser-561 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Because the serine alcohol can function as both a hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, it is unlikely that this interaction alone can discriminate a purine N6 amine from an O6 carbonyl. Inspection of the atoms surrounding Ser-561 revealed no set of interactions that could conceivably steer the hydrogen-bonding capacity of the serine alcohol. However, examination of the solvent surrounding the t1A nucleobase identified four ordered water molecules in a hydrogen-bonding network that could selectively interact with purine N6 amines. In this model, both hydrogen atoms in water \u2018A\u2019 are engaged in hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyls of Lys-440 and Met-437 (and possibly the main chain carbonyl of Asp-480), leaving only lone pair electrons available for interactions with water \u2018B\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Water B must therefore donate one hydrogen atom to establish a hydrogen bond with water A. The second hydrogen atom in water B is likely involved in a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of Ile-477. Thus, our model suggests that Ago2 uses main chain carbonyls inside the t1-binding pocket to direct the hydrogen atoms on water B away from the purine 6-position, leaving only lone pair electrons available for establishing interactions with t1 nucleotides. In the proposed orientation, the lone pair electrons on water B are positioned to accept a hydrogen bond from purine N6 amines and to repel O6 carbonyls. Waters \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 likely provide an additional layer of selectivity through interactions with the unprotonated N1 amine on t1A, and may interact with the purine N2 amine, which does not directly contact Ago2."

Briefly, Ago2 is loaded with a Cy3-labeled miRNA and introduced into a microfluidic chamber containing immobilized, Cy5-labled target RNAs. Pairing between the miRNA and the complementary site on the target RNA brings the Cy3 donor and Cy5 acceptor fluorophores into close proximity, leading to high Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which is observed at single-molecule resolution by total-internal-reflection microscopy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>)."

This observation indicates that t1A and t1DAP binding events consist of at least two discrete populations. Assuming only two populations exist, we fit each data set to a double-exponential decay and calculated that about half of the binding events (49.8% \u00b1 6.2% and 44.6% \u00b1 4.4% for t1A and t1DAP, respectively) had dwell times closely matching that of the t1U target (\u0394<i>\u03c4</i><sub>1</sub> (t1A) = 1.61 \u00b1 0.29 s; \u0394<i>\u03c4</i><sub>1</sub> (t1DAP) = 1.97 \u00b1 0.24). In contrast, the other half of the binding events had an average dwell time more than fivefold longer (\u0394<i>\u03c4</i><sub>2</sub> (t1A) = 8.69 \u00b1 0.45 s; \u0394<i>\u03c4</i><sub>2</sub> (t1DAP) = 12.87 \u00b1 0.47 s). The simplest explanation for these observations is that, when using limited seed-pairing as in our experimental setup, Ago2 dissociates from the target RNA without stably engaging t1A about half of the time. However, in cases in which Ago2 does engage t1A, the affinity of the interaction is increased substantially. This effect is exaggerated with t1DAP, which stabilizes the association further still. Notably, the t1A nucleobase inserts into the t1-binding pocket at an angle nearly orthogonal to the trajectory of the paired target RNA as it extends into the central cleft of Ago2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Based on this observation, we suggest that t1A binding increases the dwell time on target RNAs by anchoring Ago2 to seed-paired target sites and inhibiting dissociation."

Our model is reminiscent of interactions in the <i>trp</i> operator/repressor complex, which also uses an ordered network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules to achieve nucleobase recognition (<a href=\"#bib34\">Otwinowski et al., 1988</a>). We also show that the adenosine N6 amine is a key determinant of specificity and that the addition of a methyl group to the N6 amine blocks t1A recognition. Taken with the finding that m6A modifications are enriched in mammalian mRNA 3\u2032 UTRs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>), this result raises the intriguing possibility that, in some cases, miRNA targets may be partially derepressed via adenosine methylation at 7mer-A1 and 8mer sites (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartel, 2009</a>)."

The amino acids making up the t1-binding site in Ago2 are conserved in all four human Argonaute proteins, and the structure of the t1-binding pocket in Ago2 is nearly identical to the same region in the structure of human Ago1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Faehnle et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nakanishi et al., 2013</a>). In fact, two ordered water molecules corresponding to waters A and B were observed in the structure of human Ago1 crystallized in the absence of target RNA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakanishi et al., 2013</a>). We therefore suggest that all four human Argonautes likely recognize t1A nucleotides using the same mechanism. Additionally, recent studies indicate that some members of the Piwi clade of Argonaute proteins also display t1-nucleotide preferences. Specifically, the <i>Drosophila</i> protein Aubergine, the silkmoth protein Siwi, and the mouse protein Mili preferentially cleave targets bearing a t1A; while mouse protein Miwi2 prefers targets with a t1 purine (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). We note that most Piwi proteins displaying t1 preferences have conserved residues lining the t1-binding site (with the notable exception of Mili, which appears to lack several residues homologous to the t1A-binding residues in Ago2). In contrast, <i>Drosophila</i> and silkmoth Ago3, which do not display t1 preferences (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), lack homology in key residues making up the t1-binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i>, both t1A and t1U nucleotides are conserved features of many miRNA target sites, indicating that the Argonaute proteins Alg-1 and Alg-2 also have t1 nucleotide preferences (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jan et al., 2011</a>). Curiously, there are only two minor differences between residues making up the human Ago2 t1-binding pocket and the equivalent residues in Alg-1 and Alg-2 (Asn-429 and Arg-479 in Ago2). Conceivably, these substitutions could reorganize the t1-pocket water network to recognize both adenine and uracil nucleobases. Alternatively, we suggest that Alg-1 and Alg-2 may specifically bind t1A, and that conservation of miRNA sites with t1U is connected to recognition by one or more of the other <i>C. elegans</i> Argonaute proteins."

We found that the addition of a t1DAP nucleotide increased target affinity fourfold compared to non-t1A targets (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). More importantly, the t1-binding pocket has a chemically diverse surface and is spacious enough to accommodate nucleotide analogues much more elaborate than DAP. Moreover, displacement of ordered water molecules A and B may lead to entropic gains that translate into higher binding affinity, in a fashion similar to that used in the development of cyclic urea HIV-1 protease inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lam et al., 1994</a>). We suggest that t1-nucleotide analogs that make favorable contacts inside the t1-binding pocket could lead to anti-miRs that specifically target the Argonaute-miRNA complex."

The 50 \u03bcl of 50 pM acceptor-labelled mRNA construct were introduced into the chamber and incubated for 1 min. Unbound labeled constructs were washed with 100 \u00b5l of buffer T50. The effector complex was formed by incubating 50 nM purified recombinant hAgo2 with 0.5 nM of donor-labeled hsa-let-7a miRNA in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0] (Ambion, Grand Island, NY), 50 mM NaCl (Ambion), and 60 mM KCl (Ambion) at 31\u00b0C for 20 min. An imaging buffer for single-molecule FRET was added before the mixture was injected to a microfluidic chamber. The final concentration of the imaging buffer consists of the 0.8% dextrose (Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma), 85 \u00b5g/ml Catalase (Merck), and 1 mM Trolox ((\u00b1)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid, 238813, Sigma).

We found that a t1-m6A target RNA had an affinity similar to that of equivalent non-t1-A targets (see updated <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), indicating that the modification effectively blocks t1-A recognition. This result further supports the idea that the N6 amine is a key determinant in t1-A recognition and raises the intriguing possibility that adenosine methylation could lead to partial derepression of miRNA targets containing 7mer-A1 or 8mer sites."

We conducted a slightly different experiment and measured association/dissociation rates of a target RNA with t1-DAP, with dual purposes of further aligning the bulk and single molecule studies, as well as providing insights into why t1-DAP binds better than t1-A. Consistent with the bulk studies, single molecule measurements showed an increase in affinity for t1-DAP over t1-A. The increase in affinity comes entirely from an increase in the average dwell time, with the on-rate unaffected by the additional N2 amine. These results support the notion that t1-nucleotides are not used in the initial target search."

Our rational was that using the same RNAs for binding experiments and structure determination would be the best way to correlate structural findings with affinity measurements. The single molecule experiments, on the other hand, required longer target RNAs (69 nt) for reliable photophysics (to establish an optimum distance between donor and acceptor dyes) that paired to guide nt 2\u20137 (to work in an affinity range where dwell times could be accurately measured).
