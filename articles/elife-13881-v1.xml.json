We previously described a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent retrograde signaling pathway mediated by postsynaptic Synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4). To identify proteins involved in postsynaptic exocytosis, we conducted a screen for candidates that disrupted trafficking of a pHluorin-tagged Syt4 at <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Here we characterize one candidate, the postsynaptic t-SNARE Syntaxin 4 (Syx4). Analysis of <i>Syx4</i> mutants reveals that Syx4 mediates retrograde signaling, modulating the membrane levels of Syt4 and the transsynaptic adhesion protein Neuroligin 1 (Nlg1). Syx4-dependent trafficking regulates synaptic development, including controlling synaptic bouton number and the ability to bud new varicosities in response to acute neuronal stimulation. Genetic interaction experiments demonstrate <i>Syx4, Syt4</i>, and <i>Nlg1</i> regulate synaptic growth and plasticity through both shared and parallel signaling pathways. Our findings suggest a conserved postsynaptic SNARE machinery controls multiple aspects of retrograde signaling and cargo trafficking within the postsynaptic compartment."

We previously described a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent retrograde signaling pathway mediated by postsynaptic Synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4). To identify proteins involved in postsynaptic exocytosis, we conducted a screen for candidates that disrupted trafficking of a pHluorin-tagged Syt4 at <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Here we characterize one candidate, the postsynaptic t-SNARE Syntaxin 4 (Syx4). Analysis of <i>Syx4</i> mutants reveals that Syx4 mediates retrograde signaling, modulating the membrane levels of Syt4 and the transsynaptic adhesion protein Neuroligin 1 (Nlg1). Syx4-dependent trafficking regulates synaptic development, including controlling synaptic bouton number and the ability to bud new varicosities in response to acute neuronal stimulation. Genetic interaction experiments demonstrate <i>Syx4, Syt4</i>, and <i>Nlg1</i> regulate synaptic growth and plasticity through both shared and parallel signaling pathways. Our findings suggest a conserved postsynaptic SNARE machinery controls multiple aspects of retrograde signaling and cargo trafficking within the postsynaptic compartment."

The release of signaling molecules into the synaptic cleft depends on SNARE proteins that drive membrane fusion. This machinery is well understood for neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic cell: in response to an action potential, a v-SNARE in the synaptic vesicle membrane (Synpatobrevin/VAMP) engages t-SNARES in the presynaptic membrane (Syx1 and SNAP-25), forming a four-helix structure that brings the membranes into close proximity and initiates fusion (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009</a>). Although SNARE-dependent fusion drives membrane dynamics in all cell types, it is specialized in the presynaptic terminal to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, employing Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors like Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) to link synaptic vesicle fusion to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx following an action potential."

The postsynaptic cell also releases retrograde signals into the synaptic cleft to modulate synaptic growth and function. These retrograde messengers include lipid-derived molecules like endocannabinoids (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ohno-Shosaku and Kano, 2014</a>), gases like nitric oxide (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hardingham et al., 2013</a>), neurotransmitters (<a href=\"#bib33\">Koch and Magnusson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Regehr et al., 2009</a>), neurotrophins (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zweifel et al., 2005</a>), and other signaling factors like TGF-\u03b2 and Wnt (<a href=\"#bib56\">Poon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Salinas, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sanyal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Speese and Budnik, 2007</a>).

Components of a postsynaptic SNARE complex have been recently identified in mammalian dendrites. The t-SNAREs Syntaxin 3 (Stx3) and SNAP-47 are required for regulated AMPA receptor exocytosis during long term potentiation, while the v-SNARE synaptobrevin-2 regulates both activity-dependent and constitutive AMPAR trafficking (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jurado et al., 2013</a>). Stx4 has also been implicated in activity-dependent AMPAR exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kennedy et al., 2010</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent retrograde signaling pathway relies on the postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Syt4. Syt4 vesicles fuse with the postsynaptic membrane in an activity-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yoshihara et al., 2005</a>), and loss of <i>Syt4</i> leads to abnormal development and function of the NMJ. <i>Syt4</i> null animals have smaller synaptic arbors, indicating a defect in synaptic growth, and also fail to exhibit several forms of synaptic plasticity seen in control animals, including robust enhancement of presynaptic release in response to high frequency stimulation, and rapid budding of synaptic boutons in response to strong neuronal stimulation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barber et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Korkut et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Piccioli and Littleton, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yoshihara et al., 2005</a>). However, a detailed understanding of how the postsynaptic cell regulates constitutive and activity-dependent signaling of multiple retrograde pathways is lacking. In addition to exocytosis, it is likely that many cellular processes including vesicle trafficking and polarized transport of protein and transcript are specialized to facilitate postsynaptic signaling. Identifying such regulatory mechanisms is crucial for understanding synaptic development and function."

Using a fluorescently tagged form of the postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Syt4, we screened for candidate gene products that disrupted the localization of Syt4 at the postsynaptic membrane. Here we describe our characterization of one candidate from this screen, <i>Syntaxin 4 (Syx4). Drosophila Syx4</i> is the sole homolog of the mammalian Stx 3/4 family of plasma membrane t-SNAREs that also includes Syntaxin 1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Littleton, 2000</a>).

Our results demonstrate that the <i>Drosophila</i> Syx4 homolog is essential for retrograde signaling, regulating the membrane delivery of both Syt4 and Neuroligin (Nlg1), a transsynaptic adhesion protein that plays important roles in synapse formation and function, and is linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bang and Owczarek, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bottos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">S\u00fcdhof, 2008</a>).

Our screening approach employed transgenic animals expressing Syt4 tagged with pHluorin, a pH-sensitive variant of GFP under the control of the UAS promoter (<i>UAS-Syt4-pH</i>). When expressed with the muscle driver <i>24B-GAL4</i>, Syt4-pH protein decorates the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ, overlapping with glutamate receptor (GluR) fields opposite active zones (AZs) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yoshihara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Syt4-pH is also found in numerous vesicular structures throughout the muscle, many of which overlap with the Golgi marker Lava lamp (Lva) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Postsynaptic expression of Syt4-pH rescues synaptic phenotypes previously reported in <i>Syt4</i> null animals (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), including a decrease in the number of synaptic boutons and a decrease in the ability to grow new boutons (\u201cghost boutons\u201d, or GBs) in response to strong neuronal stimulation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barber et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Korkut et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Piccioli and Littleton, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yoshihara et al., 2005</a>).

These candidates fell into three qualitatively distinct categories based on the intensity of Syt4-pH at the postsynaptic membrane: decreased intensity of Syt4-pH (7/15, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,D\u2032</a>, eg. <i>Syx4-RNAi</i>), increased intensity of Syt4-pH (3/15, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,E\u2032</a>, eg. <i>Lasp-RNAi</i>), and changes in the distribution of Syt4-pH-positive vesicles with otherwise normal intensity (5/15, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,F\u2032</a>, eg. <i>Syx7-RNAi</i>). Two candidates had phenotypes consistent with previously published studies, supporting the efficacy of the screen: knockdown of <i>Syx18/Gtaxin</i> dramatically reduced Syt4 delivery, consistent with a role in postsynaptic membrane addition (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gorczyca et al., 2007</a>), and knockdown of <i>\u03b2-spectrin</i> resulted in changes in the spacing of Syt4-pH domains, consistent with a role for the spectrin cytoskeleton in AZ/GluR spacing (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pielage et al., 2006</a>). We chose to focus our analysis on one candidate, the plasma membrane t-SNARE Syx4. Knockdown of <i>Syx4</i> produced a decrease in the intensity of Syt4-pH at the postsynaptic membrane, along with large accumulations of Syt4-pH in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,D\u2032</a>), suggesting that Syx4 may regulate membrane levels of Syt4 and modulate Syt4-dependent signaling mechanisms."

                                "text": "How does loss of <i>Syx4</i> result in lower levels of Nlg1 at the postsynaptic membrane? One possibility is that less Nlg1 is delivered, and another is that Nlg1 is less stable or more mobile once it gets to the membrane. To investigate these possibilities, we measured the mobility of Nlg1 in vivo by tagging it with a photoconvertible fluorophore, Dendra2 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adam et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gurskaya et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We added the Dendra2 tag in a juxta-membrane position, as previously described for Nlg1-GFP (<a href=\"#bib7\">Banovic et al., 2010</a>). When expressed in the postsynaptic compartment using the muscle driver <i>24B-GAL4</i>, Nlg1-Dendra2 localized to the synapse similarly to Nlg1-GFP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We then used a 405 nm laser to convert approximately 50% of the fluorescent signal in a single bouton (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,C\u2032</a>), and followed the fluorescence intensity of the green (non-photoconverted; NPC) and red (photoconverted; PC) signals over a 10\u2009min period (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We measured mobility by calculating the relative change in fluorescence (\u0394F/F) in both channels from immediately after PC (t<sub>1\u2009min</sub>) to 9\u2009min after PC (t<sub>10\u2009min</sub>), in the PC bouton (ROI1) or adjacent NPC boutons (ROI2 and ROI3), after correcting for photobleaching (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2032\u2013E</a>). If Nlg1-Dendra2 moved laterally in the membrane, we would expect to see a decrease in red/PC signal in ROI1 and an increase in red/PC signal in ROIs 2 and 3. If Nlg1-Dendra2 was internalized from the membrane, we would expect to see a decrease in red/PC signal in ROI1 without any increase in red/PC signal in ROIs 2 and 3. Interestingly, we measured extremely small \u0394F/F values (&lt; 0.02%) for the red/PC signal in all ROIs, reflecting very little change in fluorescence over the time course of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). We performed the same experiment by expressing Nlg1-Dendra2 in the <i>Syx4<sup>73</sup></i> mutant background and observed a similar effect, with small \u0394F/F values in the red/PC channel, and no significant change compared to control values (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Thus, over the time course measured, Nlg1 is immobile at the synapse, and this is not changed by loss of <i>Syx4</i>. We also monitored the fluorescence of green/NPC molecules, and measured very small \u0394F/F values (&lt; 0.02%) in all ROIs for both controls and <i>Syx4<sup>73</sup></i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). It is more difficult to interpret the movement of NPC molecules in this experiment; however, given the conclusion from the red/PC channel data that Nlg1 does not move laterally in the membrane or get internalized from the membrane over the time course of the experiment, the stable fluorescence of NPC molecules allows us to infer that very little new unconverted Nlg1 is delivered to the synapse. Thus, our analysis of photoconvertible Nlg1 reveals that Nlg1 is stable at the synapse over a short time course and this stability is not compromised by loss of <i>Syx4</i>. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the lower plasma membrane level of Nlg1 in <i>Syx4</i> mutants is the result of changes in the delivery or removal of Nlg1 over a developmental time scale, or over a longer time course than our experimental paradigm."

In addition to Syx4, several other candidates motivate interesting hypotheses about regulatory pathways for postsynaptic exocytosis. MyoV is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive unconventional myosin that regulates polarized traffic (<a href=\"#bib37\">Krauss et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 2007a</a>) and the release of exosomes from motorneurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Koles et al., 2012</a>). Thus, MyoV could play a role linking Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to vesicle delivery or release at the synapse. Indeed, MyoV homologs have been implicated in regulated AMPA trafficking in mammalian dendrites (<a href=\"#bib16\">Correia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). Two Rab regulators (Gdi and Rabex) suggest that key vesicle trafficking steps en route to the synapse are modulated by Rab activation states. Also, two cell adhesion molecules (Neuroglian and Contactin) indicate potential transsynaptic mechanisms regulating retrograde signaling. Neuroglian has been shown to be required for synaptic stability (<a href=\"#bib19\">Enneking et al., 2013</a>) and it is possible that Syt4-mediated retrograde signaling plays some role in this process."

Thus, our approach of expressing Syt4-pH postsynaptically may not reveal components for the biosynthetic synthesis and transport of presynaptic Syt4. Nevertheless, the requirement for Syt4 in the postsynaptic cell for retrograde signaling is clear (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barber et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Korkut et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Piccioli and Littleton, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yoshihara et al., 2005</a>), and the results of our screen highlight regulators of Syt4 trafficking to and from the postsynaptic membrane where Syt4 vesicles fuse in an activity-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yoshihara et al., 2005</a>).

Consistent with this finding, loss of <i>Syx4</i> produces similar phenotypes to loss of <i>Syt4</i>. Both null mutants exhibit a reduction in the total number of boutons at the NMJ, indicating a defect in synaptic growth. Moreover, genetic interaction experiments clearly indicate that <i>Syx4</i> and <i>Syt4</i> interact with respect to synaptic growth. A strong genetic interaction between <i>Syx4</i> and <i>Syt4</i> is also evident at the level of lethality, as double mutant animals are lethal at a much earlier stage than either single mutant alone. Thus, even though Syx4 affects the localization of Syt4, suggesting they act in the same pathway, the genetic interaction data do not support a simple epistatic relationship. The difference in phenotypic severity, with the <i>Syx4</i> bouton number defect being significantly stronger than the <i>Syt4</i> defect, also points to Syt4 not being absolutely required for Syx4 signaling. A similar phenomenon is observed presynaptically where the t-SNARE Syx1 is indispensible for synaptic vesicle fusion, while fusion is only reduced in the absence of the synaptic vesicle Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Syt1. Taken together, we hypothesize that 1) Syx4 and Syt4 act together in a single pathway where Syx4 regulates the exocytosis of vesicles containing Syt4, and 2) Syx4 and Syt4 also act in divergent pathways, where Syt4 cooperates with other t-SNARES, and Syx4 mediates the exocytosis of vesicles in a Syt4-independent manner. This model allows for multiple possible postsynaptic SNARE complexes, regulating distinct release events. Dissecting the other components of these fusion machineries, and distinguishing activity-dependent from constitutive release events, will be important to build our understanding of how retrograde signaling is regulated."

This observation points to complex Syx4-dependent regulation of Nlg1 localization. One model is that trafficking of Nlg1 involves both a Syx4-dependent pathway and a second pathway that depends on an interaction with the Nlg1 C-terminus, which includes a PDZ-domain-binding motif. In this scenario, a severe Nlg1 trafficking defect is revealed only when both pathways are compromised. A second possibility is that in the absence of Syx4, a portion of the Nlg1 content in the cell is degraded, but that this degradation step depends on the presence of the Nlg1 cytoplasmic tail, leading to the observed aggregation of Nlg1<sup>\u0394cyto</sup> in <i>Syx4</i> mutants."

Our motivation in performing these experiments was to test possible mechanisms underlying the decrease in Nlg1 levels in <i>Syx4</i> mutants. It is possible that some Nlg1 mobility would be observed over a longer time course. Mammalian Nlg has been shown to undergo significant turnover at postsynaptic sites under LTP conditions in neuronal cell culture (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schapitz et al., 2010</a>). Also, synaptic activity has been shown to induce cleavage of Nlg and the subsequent destabilization of the Nrx-Nlg complex (<a href=\"#bib52\">Peixoto et al., 2012</a>). Thus, it remains a possibility that Nlg1 would be mobilized in response to activity in our preparation; however, we have not observed any increased mobility in response to high K<sup>+</sup> incubations in preliminary tests (data not shown). Our data are most consistent with Syx4 regulating Nlg1 over a developmental time course. A detailed examination of the relationship between Syx4 and Nlg1 dynamics will be crucial to understand how Syx4 contributes to this important pathway in synaptic development."

GB budding is regulated by both acute and developmental signaling. Because Syt4 postsynaptic vesicles fuse in an activity-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yoshihara et al., 2005</a>), it is possible that Syt4-dependent signaling releases an acute instructive cue for GB budding. Thus, one attractive model is that Nlg1 is delivered to the membrane in response to stimulation, depending on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of Syt4 and the presence of the t-SNARE Syx4 at the membrane. It is also possible that Syx4-Syt4-Nlg1 signaling is required throughout development to potentiate the synapse to respond to strong neuronal stimulation. In conclusion, Syx4, Syt4, and Nlg1 interact to regulate several aspects of synaptic biology. Our data support multiple overlapping signaling pathways regulated by these proteins, reflecting a complex modulation of retrograde signaling to control synaptic growth and plasticity at the <i>Drosophila</i> NMJ."

The strengths of the work are the robust genetics, the genetic interactions that show in vivo functional interactions between the players involved, the phenotypic analysis (with a caveat on the statistical analyses, see below), and the observed effects of Syx4 on localization of both Syt4 and Nlg1.

The first was to investigate whether Syt4-pH was functional by testing its ability to rescue <i>Syt4</i> mutants. Two prominent synaptic phenotypes that have been described in <i>Syt4</i> null animals are: 1) a decrease in the number of boutons at the NMJ, and 2) a reduction in the ability to bud new boutons (\u201cghost boutons\u201d) in response to strong neuronal stimulation. We found that when Syt4-pH was expressed postsynaptically (with a muscle GAL4 driver) in the <i>Syt4</i> mutant background, the animals resembled control animals with respect to both of these parameters. Thus, postsynaptic Syt4-pH is functional at the NMJ and able to rescue these two well-described <i>Syt4</i> mutant phenotypes.

Almost exclusively, these experiments involve creating double heterozygous animals and comparing them to single heterozygotes. For example, single heterozygotes of <i>Syx4 (Syx4/+</i>) and Syt4 (<i>Syt4/+</i>) each have a similar number of boutons as control animals, but double heterozygotes (<i>Syx/+ Syt4/+</i>) have a severe decrease in bouton number, suggesting a strong interaction between the genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However, we don't think that assessing protein localizations in these animals would alter any interpretations of our data. For example, in the <i>Syx4/Syt4</i> double heterozygotes described above, we are not proposing that any specific target protein is mislocalized, but are rather using the phenotype as evidence that the genes interact in one or parallel pathways. Similarly, the strong phenotypes observed in the <i>Syx4/Nlg</i> double heterozygotes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) suggested that these genes interact, which we then followed up by examining the protein localization of Nlg in the <i>Syx4</i> background (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5 I-K</a>). The read-out from every single genetic interactions experiment we performed is a complex phenotype regulated by multiple signaling pathways in the cell \u2013 the aim is to show that the phenotype can be modified by subtle combinatorial knock-down of two genes of interest, which then motivates follow-up to address specific mechanisms."

The primary reason for this difference lies in the specific NMJs used for analysis: in the first study, NMJs from abdominal hemisegments A2 through A5 were included in analysis, while in the current study, we only analyzed NMJs from abdominal hemisegment A3. Both NMJ size and ghost bouton budding vary substantially between hemisegments, with hemisegment A2 typically having more boutons and more ghost boutons, and hemisegments A4 and A5 having fewer boutons and fewer ghost boutons, compared to A3. Both analyses are valid, as long as equal numbers of each hemisegment are included across genotypes in the first approach. For this study, our analysis of only A3 hemisegments yields a higher average of ghost bouton budding over all, and a smaller SEM value, and is the preferred approach for us going forward as we reduce variability associated with different size NMJs at distinct abdominal segments."

This is a non-parametric test that considers only rank order and throws away quantitative data, making it not very effective at detecting significant effects. I don't see how n of 4 can be high enough to give such significant P values, and conversely, a non-significant P value can result from the low statistical power (and n) of this test. Even for a parametric test, an n of 4 is barely acceptable. The authors need a better way to interpret their data and draw robust conclusions, e.g. increase n, and/or compare a parameter that is normally distributed.</i>"
