We show that over weeks following the acquisition of two distinct associative memories, neuron firing in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (mPFC) became less selective for perceptual features unique to each association and, with an apparently different time-course, became more selective for common relational features. We further found that during exposure to a novel experimental context, memory expression and neuron selectivity for relational features immediately generalized to the new situation. These neural patterns offer a window into the network-level processes by which the mPFC develops a knowledge structure of the world that can be adaptively applied to new experiences."

We show that over weeks following the acquisition of two distinct associative memories, neuron firing in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (mPFC) became less selective for perceptual features unique to each association and, with an apparently different time-course, became more selective for common relational features. We further found that during exposure to a novel experimental context, memory expression and neuron selectivity for relational features immediately generalized to the new situation. These neural patterns offer a window into the network-level processes by which the mPFC develops a knowledge structure of the world that can be adaptively applied to new experiences."

Whenever you attend a party, for example, you may well take along a gift, such as a bottle of wine or a box of chocolates, but the gift will differ on each occasion. Psychologists believe that as our memories for such events become older, the incidental details unique to each event (such as the identity of the gift) are mostly forgotten. However, the common underlying patterns (what parties are like in general) are retained. This allows us to accumulate knowledge to guide our behavior in similar situations in the future."

While knowledge forms from experiences, over time memories of the experiences themselves often lose their contextual richness (<a href=\"#bib11\">Furman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sekeres et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Winocur et al., 2007</a>). According to theories of systems memory consolidation, the process by which knowledge is formed involves the gradual reorganization of networks within interconnected brain regions that include the hippocampus and neocortex (<a href=\"#bib26\">McClelland et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Winocur et al., 2010</a>). One region that seems to be particularly involved in long-term memory is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; <a href=\"#bib9\">Frankland et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Takashima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Takehara et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</a>). The mPFC is necessary for learning new goals and behaviors when this learning depends on pre-existing knowledge (rodents: <a href=\"#bib37\">Richards et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; humans: <a href=\"#bib13\">Ghosh et al., 2014</a>), and human imaging data indicate that the mPFC is activated when subjects use existing knowledge to encode new information (<a href=\"#bib47\">van Kesteren et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kumaran, 2013</a>), make inferences (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zeithamova and Preston, 2010</a>), and guide decision making (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kumaran et al., 2009</a>). The question remains as to how this role is supported by changes in neural signaling that take place throughout learning and subsequent consolidation. Based on the hypothesis that the mPFC provides the brain with schematic knowledge\u2014<i>i.e.</i>, a framework of abstract associations about environment-behavior relationships\u2014we predict that mPFC neuron ensembles build representations of correlations common to multiple experiences over a time period that systems consolidation is known to take place; furthermore, we expect that information for these common relationships is disproportionately represented relative to context-specific information."

The two memories both rely on a trace eyeblink conditioning procedure, in which a neutral stimulus (CS) is paired with eyelid stimulation (US) with a stimulus-free interval between CS offset and US onset. The retrieval of this memory initially depends on the hippocampus, but over the course of two to four weeks becomes dependent on the prelimbic region of the mPFC (<a href=\"#bib40\">Takehara et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Takehara-Nishiuchi et al., 2006</a>). Over this same time, mPFC neuron ensembles develop selective firing patterns for the acquired CS-US associations and maintain stable representation thereafter, a change that takes place with or without continued conditioning (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hattori et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</a>). These observations make trace eyeblink conditioning ideal for examining the evolution of the selectivity of mPFC ensemble activity across time. We find that the development of mPFC population codes for common task features involves bi-directional changes in selectivity for relational versus physical stimulus features over weeks after learning."

Four rats underwent daily trace eyeblink conditioning with each session divided into two epochs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</a>). Within each epoch, 20 control trials were initially presented in which the auditory or visual CS was presented alone, these were then followed by 80 trials in which the CS was paired with the US. The trials were separated by an interval that was pseudorandomized across trials and ranged from 20 to 40 s. The CS-alone trials were critical to establish neural selectivity for the CS-US relational structure. Over the course of approximately 12 conditioning sessions, rats developed anticipatory blinking responses (conditioned responses, CRs) that peaked near the expected onset of the US; this anticipatory behavior was specific for CS-US paired trials and was not observed in CS-alone trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Importantly, the increased frequency of eyeblink responses (CR%) was only observed during the period before US onset (post-CS phase; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; for CR% in individual rats, see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), but not during the period before CS onset (pre-CS phase; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Three-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant phase \u00d7 trial type \u00d7 session interaction, F<sub>75,468</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0235.66, p&lt;0.001). In CS-US paired trials, CR% during the post-CS phase became greater across sessions, but CR% during pre-CS phase did not (follow-up two-way repeated measure ANOVA, phase \u00d7 session interaction, F<sub>25,156</sub>\u00a0=\u00a07.931, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, in CS-alone trials, CR% did not change across sessions or differ between the pre- and post-CS phases (phase \u00d7 session interaction, F<sub>25,156</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.684, p=0.867). A nonparametric test also showed the significant difference in CR% across four trial types during the post-CS phase (Friedman test, \u03c7<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 327.36, p&lt;0.001). Once performance reached asymptote, CR% showed an abrupt transition between CS-alone and CS-US trials in each session (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This discontinuity suggested that the learning process involved successful encoding of the distinct temporal context between earlier and later trials; <i>i.e.</i>, that CS-alone trials at the start of the trial block did not simply extinguish associations acquired on previous days. Thus, the present behavioral protocol enabled the rats to acquire two associative memories (ACS-US and VCS-US association) that shared a common, relational feature (<i>i.e.</i>, the CS-US association), but differed in a discrete, physical feature (<i>i.e.</i>, the sensory modality of CS). They also acquired the temporal context that initial trials within each epoch would not be paired with the US."

Recordings were performed with a chronically implanted microdrive (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kloosterman et al., 2009</a>) containing 14 independently-movable, four-channel electrodes (\u2018tetrodes\u2019, [<a href=\"#bib50\">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</a>]). The movement of each tetrode was minimized to sample the activity of neurons located in a comparable part of the prelimbic region throughout the one-month period of daily recording. Our data, therefore, consist of some neurons sampled repeatedly across days and others sampled once (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). During learning, the neuron ensemble in the mPFC showed different firing rate changes to the auditory and visual CS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, for the remaining three rats), and also distinguished between the auditory CS presented alone and the auditory CS paired with the US. Differential firing to the two CSs was evident during the CS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; permutation tests on the similarity of ensemble patterns for ACS alone and ACS-US paired vs. that for ACS-US paired and VCS-US paired, p=0.001 and 0.002 in two 50-ms bins during the CS) while differential patterns between CS-alone and CS-US trials were detectable during the interval between the CS and US (in 3 out of 8 bins, p&lt;0.002). By the third week after learning, at which point the behavioral expression of the CS-US association is known to depend on the mPFC (<a href=\"#bib40\">Takehara et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Takehara-Nishiuchi et al., 2006</a>), the mPFC ensemble differentiated between CS-alone trials and CS-US trials more than it differentiated between visual and auditory CS trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). During the CS, the similarity of neuron firing patterns for two trial types with the same CS was no longer different from that for trial types with different CSs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; permutation test, p=0.099, 0.981). During the CS-US interval, however, the similarity of neuron firing patterns became higher for trials with the shared stimulus relationship than for those without (in 6 out of 8 bins, p&lt;0.001). Similar patterns were also observed in changes of firing rate evoked by the CS (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Whereas during learning, the ensemble patterns of CS-evoked firings were similar between CS-alone and CS-US paired trials, they became more similar for ACS-US and VCS-US paired trials during the third post-learning week. At a finer timescale, within a single session of the third post-learning week, the ensemble activity rapidly evolved into a new, statistically uncorrelated pattern within the first ten ACS-US paired trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), which was tightly coupled with the time course over which the rats increased the frequency of CR expression at the beginning of ACS-US paired block (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Upon the transition from the epoch with the ACS to another with the VCS, the ensemble similarity drastically dropped but went up again as the block of VCS-US pairings began. In contrast, during learning, the degree of ensemble differentiation across the four conditions appeared to be smaller, and it took a greater number of trials until the ensemble pattern evolved into a new pattern upon the block shift (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Collectively, these observations suggest that initially, the mPFC ensemble encoded both the physical as well as relational features of the stimuli to a comparable degree; however, after extensive experience, the mPFC ensemble code became less sensitive to physical (sensory) features unique to each memory and more sensitive to their common, relational feature."

                                "text": "To unpack the observed difference in neuron selectivity between learning and post-learning periods, we tracked mPFC ensemble selectivity for relational (CS-alone versus CS-US trials) and physical (ACS versus VCS trials) features over five successive stages of learning. For these analyses, we used a machine classifier to establish the degree to which neuron populations differentiated\u2014i.e., could successfully distinguish\u2014trials of each condition. Conditioning sessions were divided into five learning stages separately for each rat based on CR rate (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The stages were: (1) Before Learning, when CR% was less than 30, (2) Learning, during which the rate of CRs progress to an asymptotic level, and (3\u20135) Post\u00a01W, 2W, and 3W, which correspond to the first, second, and third week after CR expression reached asymptote. In each stage, selectivity of the mPFC ensemble activity for relational and physical features was quantified by applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to binned firing rates during intervals between the CS and US in four conditions. Better performance of the classifier reflects higher selectivity of neuron population firings for the relational and physical features that differentiate the four conditions. The classification accuracy greatly varied across five stages of learning (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; one-way ANOVA, F<sub>4,95</sub>\u00a0=\u00a011.34, p&lt;0.001). Examination of the specific classification errors (the \u2018confusion matrix\u2019, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) showed that in the Before Learning and Learning stages, the majority of inaccurate classifications resulted from errors in discriminating CS alone trials from CS-US paired trials. In contrast, across the post-learning weeks, the classifier made more errors in discriminating ACS trials from VCS trials, suggesting that across time prefrontal ensemble activity appeared to become more sensitive to the paired vs. unpaired trial blocks and less sensitive to stimulus modalities. This was confirmed by applying the SVM method to make binary discriminations in the relational (CS alone vs. CS-US trial blocks) and physical (ACS vs. VCS trial blocks) dimensions: classification accuracy for the relational feature significantly improved across stages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; one-way ANOVA, F<sub>4,95</sub>\u00a0=\u00a09.99, p&lt;0.001); while classification accuracy for the physical feature steadily decreased (one-way ANOVA, F<sub>4,95</sub>\u00a0=\u00a03.77, p=0.007). Notably, increased selectivity for the relational dimension took place primarily during first and second post-learning weeks (Before Learning versus Post 2, or 3W, Learning versus Post 1, 2, or 3W, Tukey HSD, p&lt;0.05), whereas selectivity for the physical dimension decreased during the third post-learning week (Post 3W versus Before Learning, Tukey HSD, p&lt;0.05). These results suggest that the process by which the mPFC extracts knowledge about environmental structure across time, as reflected in the increased coding for stimulus relationships, may be independent from its declining sensitivity to sensory features of the stimuli."

To examine whether relational coding generalized to a novel situation, three rats were trained for approximately 30 sessions in the paradigm described above, and were then presented with the same structure of 20 CS-alone trials and 80 CS-US trials, using only the auditory CS, in the old chamber (Box 1) and in a new conditioning chamber (Box 2; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The new chamber differed from the old chamber in the visual appearance of the walls, illumination, and texture of the floor. The rats immediately responded with CRs to the auditory CS-US pairings in the new chamber (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Prefrontal neurons exhibited similar firing patterns during CS-US pairings in the two chambers, while also maintaining clear differentiation between the CS-US pairings and CS-alone trials within each chamber (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Similarly, population decoding analysis revealed weak selectivity of neuron ensemble activity for the conditioning chamber but high selectivity for CS alone vs. CS-US trials (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>): the classifier made many errors discriminating CS-US pairings in Box 1 from those in Box 2 while making few errors discriminating the CS alone trails in Box 1 and Box 2.

We\u00a0show\u00a0that, after\u00a0learning, there is a gradual refinement of prefrontal neuron selectivity that may be a direct neuronal analog for this knowledge development process. Over a one-month period of repeated exposures to two similar experiences, mPFC ensemble activity gradually becomes more sensitive to their latent, relational variables; meanwhile, over time, information about perceptual, physical features of the environment is lost within this ensemble. Importantly, the selectivity for the physical features was weakened <i>after</i>, but not during learning, supporting the view that it underlies the mPFC\u2019s involvement in the extraction of commonalities from previous experiences (<a href=\"#bib37\">Richards et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2012</a>), rather than the learning of two stimulus associations. These results speak directly to a long-standing question in the field of whether the formation of generalized, or schematized memory is merely a product of the network \u2018forgetting\u2019 incidental features. Quite to the contrary, population analyses revealed different time-courses in the development of coding for relational features compared with the loss of selectivity for physical features. Examinations of single neuron activity also revealed that the former appears to rely more on increased magnitude of firing rate differences over weeks, whereas the latter appears to involve decreased reliability of differential firing. The presently observed prefrontal neuron ensemble changes are likely to be part of the physiological basis of the mPFC\u2019s contribution to an animal\u2019s ability to construct, maintain, and update an associative knowledge structure used to behave adaptively in familiar and novel environments (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ghosh and Gilboa, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">van Kesteren et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Richards et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2012</a>)."

In fact, during learning, the mPFC ensemble firing differentiated the physical features of the experiences to a comparable degree to the relational features (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3C</a>, see also, <a href=\"#bib17\">Hyman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ma et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, although the ensemble differentiation between ACS-US and VCS-US pairings decreased, neural responses to the two CSs remained highly differentiated in the CS-alone condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This observation is not consistent with a view that the weakened selectivity for the physical feature reflects a form of learned equivalence between the stimuli, arising from their equivalent associated outcome (<a href=\"#bib15\">Honey and Hall, 1989</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Iordanova et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Miller and Dollard, 1941</a>).

In the present study, both the temporal structure of the CS-US pairings and the outcome itself were common between the visual and auditory CS-US trials. Therefore, it remains unclear whether mPFC neurons only encode the predicted outcome, rather than the more abstract associative, temporal relationship between the stimuli. Results from other studies suggest that the mPFC can discriminate between situations with the same outcomes within the same environment, if only the rules for negotiating the environment differ (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rich and Shapiro, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Durstewitz et al., 2010</a>). Thus, although the present study did not explicitly alter the outcome, it seems reasonable to suppose that behavioral savings between paradigms with overlapping rules or temporal structure, even when the outcomes or unconditioned stimuli themselves are altered, will rely on representations within the mPFC that develop over consolidation, as described presently."

Neural selectivity for the CS-US relationship (the relational feature) is no less a product of time than experience, because it becomes strengthened with or without repeated daily conditionings after learning (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hattori et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</a>). These observations, however, do not address whether the weakened selectivity for physical features requires continued conditioning. It is worth noting that the <i>loss</i> of selectivity may very well require no active process at all (see also, <a href=\"#bib37\">Richards et al., 2014</a>), as it could be accounted for by the lack of reinforcement over time. In that sense, the repeated exposures in the present study may be working <i>against</i> the weakening of selectivity that we observed. Testing this point directly requires future studies which monitor the selectivity of mPFC neurons over time with manipulations of multiple variables that include the number of different \u2018CS-US\u2019 exemplars animals are exposed to, the similarity between exemplars, the temporal proximity between exposures, and elapsed time from the exposures."

This is not due to the inability of mPFC ensemble to encode environmental features because it showed distinct firing patterns during two neutral experiences taking place in two different environments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hyman et al., 2012</a>). This immediate transfer of an existing abstract code may serve as a key computational basis for the assimilation of new information to a pre-existing knowledge structure (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartlett, 1932</a>). Experimental evidence from rodent behavioral studies and human imaging studies suggests that memory assimilation depends on the mPFC (<a href=\"#bib6\">DeVito et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Richards et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2012</a>), hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dusek and Eichenbaum, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Iordanova et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tse et al., 2007</a>), and their interactions (<a href=\"#bib47\">van Kesteren et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kumaran et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zeithamova et al., 2012</a>). Some theories posit that mPFC-hippocampal interactions during memory assimilation may be an extension of those during memory retrieval: where the mPFC selects a memory that is the most appropriate in a current context and sends top-down signals to the hippocampus to recover its contents (<a href=\"#bib34\">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</a>). From a computational perspective, the initial selection process likely relies on pattern completion of mPFC ensemble activity from cues available in a current context (<a href=\"#bib41\">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</a>). This would activate downstream targets, including the rhinal cortices (<a href=\"#bib33\">Paz et al., 2007</a>) that have connections with other neocortical regions as well as the hippocampus. The former may result in the recovery of a gist-like version of previous experiences (<a href=\"#bib18\">Insel and Takehara-Nishiuchi, 2013</a>), whereas the latter may facilitate the acquisition of new information (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bero et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</a>) by activating neurons bearing original memories (<a href=\"#bib27\">McKenzie et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Navawongse and Eichenbaum, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</a>).

For each trial, the average amplitude during a 300 ms period immediately before CS-presentation was defined as the Pre-Value. The averaged amplitude during a 200 ms period immediately before US-presentation was defined as the CR-Value in the post-CS phase, and the averaged amplitude during a 200 ms period around 0.9 s before CS onset was defined as the CR value in the pre-CS phase.

Once rats begin to form this association, the percentage of trials in which they exhibit a CR rapidly increases, but it can fluctuate greatly across days. We define this period as the Learning stage.

Harris, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ; MClust, author: D.A. Redish, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN; Waveform Cutter, author: S.L. Cowen, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States). Both automatic spike-sorting and manual sorting were used to assign each action potential to one of the neurons recorded simultaneously on one tetrode based on the relative amplitudes on the different tetrode channels and various other waveform parameters including peak/valley amplitudes, energy, and waveform principle components. The final result was a collection of time stamps associated with each action potential from a given neuron. Only neurons with\u00a0&lt;1% of inter-spike intervals distribution falling within a 2\u00a0ms refractory period were used in the final analysis. If a neuron did not show more than 1500 spikes during the entire recording session, it was removed from further analyses due to the insufficient number of spike waveforms to confidently judge if they were spikes recorded from a real neuron or noise. An individual neuron was defined as a unit that was well isolated from raw signals recorded on a tetrode. Because we minimized the movement of tetrodes across days, some units which appeared to belong to the same neuron were recorded across a few days (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We treated each of these units as a separate sample of a neuron. The total number of neurons is the summation of the number of isolated units across tetrodes, sessions, and rats\u00a0(<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Therefore, our data consist of some neurons sampled repeatedly across days and others sampled in one day. Because we were mainly interested in comparisons of ensemble selectivity across learning stages, having repeatedly sampled neurons across days was beneficial because it reduces the variability in sampled neurons across learning stages."

The population firing vectors were constructed by concatenating the responses of a set of <i>N</i> neurons on a trial from one of four conditions.

We first identified SVM parameters that maximized decoding accuracy by performing a grid search procedure (calculating decoding performance over a range of cost and gamma SVM parameters) for each set of training data. This was done by using a 5-fold cross-validation procedure to minimize over-fitting. In each SVM run, twenty trials of each of four conditions were randomly drawn, without replacement, from all the recorded trials and used to create a population firing rate matrix of <i>N</i> neurons\u00a0\u00d7\u00a080 trials. Then, in each neuron, the firing rate in each trial was divided by the maximum firing rate of the neuron across the 80 trials. Half of the trials (10 trials from each condition) from each condition were then used to select the parameters with the grid search and subsequently to train the SVM classifier with these parameters. The remaining trials (10 trials from each condition) were then used to test the decoding accuracy after training. The process was repeated 20 times using a different sampling of ten training and ten test trials each time. Based on the classifications, a confusion matrix was created, which indicated the proportion of classifications in which a population firing vector belonging to condition <i>X</i> was classified as condition <i>Y</i>."

We entered the population firing rate during a series of 200\u00a0ms bins over a 1.4 s period around CS onset (50% overlap) to the SVM classifier (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Decoding accuracy was significantly better than chance even prior to CS presentation, but it further increased at CS onset and remained high until US onset (random permutation test, all data points, p&lt;0.001). The high decoding accuracy during CS-US intervals was consistently observed when the input was the population firing patterns with bin sizes of 100 and 50 ms; however, the overall decoding accuracy worsened with a smaller size (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Rats were first injected intraperitoneally with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. For tetrodes, 5 \u03bcA was passed through one wire of each tetrode (positive to the electrode, negative to animal ground) for 20 s, for LFP electrodes 20 \u03bcA was passed for 45 s. Rats were then perfused intracardially with 0.9% saline followed by 10% buffered formalin. The brain was removed from the skull and stored in 10% formalin for several days. For cryogenic sectioning, the tissue was infiltrated with 30% sucrose solution, frozen and sectioned in a cryostat (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at 50 \u03bcm. Sectioned tissue was stained with cresyl violet and imaged under a light microscope to locate electrode locations. Only recordings from tetrodes located in the prelimbic region of mPFC were used for single unit analysis."

Neural activity was recorded as rats were trained for several weeks to associated 100ms auditory or visual cues with US. The sessions consisted of blocks of each cue. In each the cue was presented 20x without US and then 80x paired with a US. Anticipatory eyeblink was measured during the 500ms trace interval compared to a pre-CS interval. Elevated eyeblink was considered a CR, and the% of trials with CR's increased during the US blocks but not during the CS-only blocks across sessions. Neural activity was subsequently analyzed via ensemble analysis and was found to distinguish the two visual cues better early in learning than later in learning, whereas the neural activity distinguished the CS-only and CS-US blocks better after learning and during 3 weeks of over-training. This pattern was found to persist if the rats were tested in a novel environment."

It seems like trials on which there was no elevation of responding were discarded. I don't really understand this and what it means for the% CR plotted in the paper. A clearer description of this is necessary. More importantly, it was not stated what the intertrial intervals are. If they are very short, then I think it is possible that the rats are not distinguishing the cue-context associations to guide responding but rather are simply taking their cue from the absence or presence of shock and then responding accordingly. This should be simple to sort out. The authors just need to analyze eyeblinks during a period in the ITI versus their anticipatory period, to each cue, in the two blocks, across sessions, and show that there are the appropriate effects. Specifically, the analysis requires that there be a session X block X pre/post cue interaction and subsequently they should be able to show that this interaction is because with learning, there develops a differential anticipatory response in the US blocks that is not present in the CS-only blocks. This is the same thing that their analysis might be showing, but I am basically not sure. If done, it becomes easier to see why the ensembles don't care about the cues with learning. Indeed, possibly this is the reason. And that may still be fine, but it would be a subtly different point than the authors want to make."

Wouldn't that lead to exactly the pattern of data that they find? What is different here from what I would expect if I took two cues that are neutral and then paired them with a potent, biologically meaningful US in some contexts but not others? Wouldn't you expect the ensembles to become more highly attuned to the common US predictions that the cues make, and therefore weaker at representing the sensory features of the cues on a relative level? Could the analysis have come out another way? What if you did not train during the subsequent 3 weeks after learning? You mentioned that the transfer to mPFC dependence does not require training right? Isn't it important to show that this \"consolidation\" does not either? What if it does? Then would it not reflect the process claimed?"

This result actually suggests that the rats learned three relations, the two CS-US contingencies, and that initial trials within each epoch would not be paired with a US. This point could be addressed in the subsection \u201cRats learned two associative memories sharing a common stimulus relationship\u201d. It might be very interesting to look at the first two trials of each 80 trial block, one might predict that the first trial would be similar to the CS alone trials and that the second trial would exhibit conditioned responding that increases across sessions, i.e. trial 1 of the 80 trial sequence would reinstate previous learning and demonstrate memory. Also in regard to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, the authors should use a nonparametric analysis given that there are only four rats in the study."

The data were normalized to the maximum firing rate of the neuron which is unusual for this reader (subsection \u201cPopulation Firing Rate Matrix\u201d). Most reports indicate either raw firing rates or rates normalized to a time window prior to onset of the CS, i.e. standard scores. One may get more out of the figure if the neurons were ordered by the amount of change relative to baseline, as that would make it easier to understand the responsiveness of the group. It would be good to indicate the number of neurons recorded. The Y axis shows 213 and 80 neurons, but the legend refers to Neuron #340. In the first paragraph of the subsection \u201cTime-dependent changes in the selectivity for relational and physical features were driven by 2 independent changes in single neuron firing properties\u201d it indicates that 2066 neurons were recorded. This probably includes neurons recorded prior to the behavioral plateau \u2013 but an explanation should be given somewhere what happened to all of the neurons not illustrated.

A significant difference is indicated for the magnitude (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), although the change in the index does not appear to increase much relative to the confidence interval. It also seems that the A and D sections of this figure are a bit misleading, as they are schematic diagrams of a \"hypothetical change\" \u2013 and the change illustrated seems to be considerably larger than the actual data in the lower sections of the figure. Perhaps the results would be clearer if plotted as mean ranks rather than the Differentiation Index, especially since the analysis was based on an analysis of rank scores.

The large increase in EMG amplitude was because a rat engaged in grooming, teeth grinding, or climbing. Any sporadic large EMG amplitude before CS onset is problematic for CR detection because CR is defined as an increase in EMG amplitude before US onset relative to the amplitude before CS onset. Further, when this activity is initiated before CS onset, it could carry through to the trace interval and produce false positives. Therefore, these trials were discarded as was done in our previous work (Takehara et al., 2003; Morrissey et al., 2012; Tanninen et al., 2013, 2015; Volle et al., 2016).

This should be simple to sort out. The authors just need to analyze eyeblinks during a period in the ITI versus their anticipatory period, to each cue, in the two blocks, across sessions, and show that there are the appropriate effects. Specifically, the analysis requires that there be a session X block X pre/post cue interaction and subsequently they should be able to show that this interaction is because with learning, there develops a differential anticipatory response in the US blocks that is not present in the CS-only blocks. This is the same thing that their analysis might be showing, but I am basically not sure. If done, it becomes easier to see why the ensembles don't care about the cues with learning. Indeed, possibly this is the reason. And that may still be fine, but it would be a subtly different point than the authors want to make.</i>"

In the present manuscript, we offer new, qualitative, and quantitative observations about the changes in prefrontal ensemble selectivity taking place over a month of repeated conditionings. Past findings (Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008; Hattori et al., 2014) demonstrated that some of these changes (CS-US relationship coding) are no less a product of time than experience because they take place with or without repeated conditionings. Although these observations support the hypothesis that changes in prefrontal neuron selectivity are driven by hippocampal-dependent off-line replay, we can not rule-out the possibility that the weakened selectivity for physical features does not involve this process. It is worth noting that the <i>loss</i> of selectivity may very well require no active process at all, as it could be accounted for by the lack of reinforcement over time. In that sense, the repeated exposures may be working <i>against</i> the effects that we observed. Testing these points directly will require new experiments, ideally experiments which manipulate multiple variables that include the number of different \u201cCS-US\u201d exemplars animals are exposed to, the similarity between exemplars, the temporal proximity between exposures, and elapsed time from the exposures. We have added a section in the Discussion to address these points (fourth paragraph)."

We found that the ensemble activity rapidly evolved into a new, statistically uncorrelated pattern as the block of CS-US paired trials began (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). During the third week after learning, this transition occurred within the first 10 ACS-US paired trials, which mirrors the time course over which the rats increased the frequency of CR expression at the beginning of CS-US paired trial block (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). During learning, on the other hand, the transition took ~20 ACS-US paired trials (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Furthermore, upon the shift from the epoch with the auditory CS to the one with the visual CS, the ensemble similarity abruptly dropped, but it gradually went up when the block of VCS-US paired trials began (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The standard score, on the other hand, emphasizes the difference in CS-evoked firings but ignores any across-condition difference in baseline firing rate. The latter is problematic because, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, ensemble firing rate before the CS presentation also carried some information about the condition. Therefore, we kept the original figures but added a new section and figure that discusses the ensemble patterns of CS-evoked firings using the standard score (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).
