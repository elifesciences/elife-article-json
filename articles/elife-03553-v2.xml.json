Improper access to the genome leads to translocations and mutations in B cells and contributes to the mutation landscape in cancer, such as kataegis. It remains unclear how deaminases access double stranded genomes and whether off-target mutations favor certain loci, although transcription and opportunistic access during DNA repair are thought to play a role. In yeast, AID and the catalytic domain of APOBEC3G preferentially mutate transcriptionally active genes within narrow regions, 110 base pairs in width, fixed at RNA polymerase initiation sites. Unlike APOBEC3G, AID shows enhanced mutational preference for small RNA genes (tRNAs, snoRNAs and snRNAs) suggesting a putative role for RNA in its recruitment. We uncover the high affinity of the deaminases for the single stranded DNA exposed by initiating RNA polymerases (a DNA configuration reproduced at stalled polymerases) without a requirement for specific cofactors."

Improper access to the genome leads to translocations and mutations in B cells and contributes to the mutation landscape in cancer, such as kataegis. It remains unclear how deaminases access double stranded genomes and whether off-target mutations favor certain loci, although transcription and opportunistic access during DNA repair are thought to play a role. In yeast, AID and the catalytic domain of APOBEC3G preferentially mutate transcriptionally active genes within narrow regions, 110 base pairs in width, fixed at RNA polymerase initiation sites. Unlike APOBEC3G, AID shows enhanced mutational preference for small RNA genes (tRNAs, snoRNAs and snRNAs) suggesting a putative role for RNA in its recruitment. We uncover the high affinity of the deaminases for the single stranded DNA exposed by initiating RNA polymerases (a DNA configuration reproduced at stalled polymerases) without a requirement for specific cofactors."

Their success in restricting infection is reflected in the fact that the family has undergone a rapid expansion in primates and humans (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jarmuz et al., 2002</a>). The ancestral founder of the family, activation induced deaminase (AID), functions in the adaptive immune system to mutate antibody genes in B cells as a fast mechanism to promote diversity of the antibody response to match the rapid evolution of pathogens during infection. The evolutionary advantages of these strategies are counterbalanced by the risk of exposing the host genome to active mutagenesis, a frequent cause of oncogenic transformation in leukaemia and lymphomas of B cell origin."

The combined mutational landscape observed in mammalian genomes is complicated by the contribution from multiple cellular processes in addition to enzymatic deamination, such as metabolic oxidation, methyl-CpG deamination and aging, thus elucidating the precise contribution of the APOBECs is far from straightforward (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexandrov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lawrence et al., 2013</a>). However the peculiar clustering of same strand mutations at TpC dinucleotides observed in kataegic mutations in breast cancers constitutes a hallmark of the APOBEC3A and 3B deaminases that can be experimentally induced. Repair of double stranded DNA breaks can expose long patches of single stranded DNA with multiple deaminations leading to the mutation clusters observed in association with genomic rearrangements in breast cancer genomes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Taylor et al., 2013</a>)."

The mechanism that preferentially directs AID to the immunoglobulin genes is not fully understood, but active transcription has been repeatedly invoked as a requirement (Reviewed in <a href=\"#bib51\">Storb, 2014</a>) and many of the proteins found to be associated with AID are also involved in transcription and mRNA processing (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pavri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Basu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Okazaki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Willmann et al., 2012</a>).

As with sporadic AID mutations, the circumstances that promote or grant access of the APOBECs to single stranded DNA substrates of the host are not known. We have shown that overexpresison of deaminases in yeast faithfully recapitulates the mutation signatures observed in mammalian genomes. Here we have attempted to identify genomic features that promote or are permissive for enzymatic deamination by footprinting mutator activity on multiple genomes. Our results indeed reveal a preferential targeting of the deaminases to defined regions of the genome that is not dependent on cofactors but is rather based on accessibility, with structural features of the DNA at the promoter of actively transcribed genes being the key determinant. We also uncover a potential mechanistic explanation for the targeting and off-target preferences of the antibody diversification mutator AID."

                                "text": "Overexpression of cytidine deaminases in yeast leads to the accumulation of genome wide mutations, which can be monitored by the number of cells resistant to the arginine analogue L-Canavinine through inactivation of the arginine permease CAN1 gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We have previously shown that such overexpression leads to an uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) dependent enrichment of kataegic mutations through deamination of cytosines on single stranded DNA intermediates during the repair of double strand breaks (<a href=\"#bib53\">Taylor et al., 2013</a>). To assess the distribution of isolated mutations, we obtained a dataset largely devoid of kataegic mutations by expressing the deaminases in <i>ung</i>\u0394 cells. Overexpression of AID* (an AID hyperactive mutant [<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Taylor et al., 2013</a>]) in haploid cells results in highly elevated frequency of Canavinine resistant colonies (164 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>), but relatively few mutations, averaging 61 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) per genome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Diploid cells can overcome this limit as they avoid the reduction in fitness costs caused by accumulated mutation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Waters and Parry, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lada et al., 2013</a>). Our experimental setting confirms this effect; whereas the mutation frequency is reduced almost 40-fold due to the requirement to inactivate both CAN1 alleles, the genome wide SNV increase over 10-fold, averaging 796 SNVs per genome for AID* and 592 SNVs for transformants expressing sA3G* (a hyperactive mutant of the catalytic domain of human APOBEC3G [<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2009</a>]; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). For comparison, a database of mutations at C\u2022G pairs was generated using the alkylating agent ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). Alkylation of guanosines promotes base pairing with thymine, thereby causing G &gt; A transitions during replication. Overnight exposure of diploid cells to 0.2% EMS resulted in increased mutation frequency and SNV load per genome similar to that elicited by the deaminases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

The transcription link is interpreted as a mechanism that facilitates access of AID due to the generation of single stranded DNA intermediates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chaudhuri et al., 2003</a>). We therefore wondered whether AID induced MELs would be found associated with transcription. Contrary to expectation, enrichment analysis reveals that both AID* and sA3G* MELs are depleted within the body of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcribed mRNA genes and rather that the deaminase induced mutations are preferentially associated with promoter regions, with over 76% of deaminase targeted hotspots found at promoters, compared to just 24% for simulated fragments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

Mutation accumulation is skewed upstream of the TSS (peak at -21 bp and -38 bp for AID* and sA3G* respectively; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), corresponding to the nucleosome free region where the pre-initiation RNAP complex forms before scanning for the TSS (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>). Indeed, aligning SNVs to the TATA box/TATA-like element or TSS revealed that not only are the majority of promoter associated mutations occurring between these two features (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), there is also a paucity of mutations at the TATA-element suggesting this region is protected by TBP/TFIID binding (this paucity is, at least for AID*, not due to an absence of mutable sequence motifs; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Intriguingly, the peak of AID* and sA3G* induced SNVs centred 30 base pairs from the TATA-element, the region where TBP guides TFIIB to load RNAPII for the formation of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>)."

Rather than simply transcription factor binding at the promoter, active initiation by RNAP II is important for MEL development (Wilcox test p &lt; 0.005 for all groups; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The transition of RNAP II from the pre-initiation complex to the elongation complex is associated with a shift in phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) serine 5/7 to serine 2 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). In agreement with the transcription rate analysis, deaminase MELs are associated with both high levels of RNAP II occupancy and CTD-S5P, that parallels the association with the highest transcribed genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Indeed, the recurrent association of both AID* and sA3G* MELs with regions enriched for the basal transcription machinery and in particular Spt16 -a chromatin chaperon associated with highly transcribed genes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Formosa, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), reinforces the idea that active transcription and potential pausing (at promoters highly dependent on the FACT/Spt16 complex) determines the deaminases targeting."

Analysis of mutations in highly transcribed non-RNAP II dependent transcripts, such as RNAP III dependent tRNA genes, astonishingly reveals an even more pronounced enrichment of targeted hotspots with 78% of the genomic regions corresponding to tRNAs harbouring repeated mutations. While we find that both sA3G* and AID* MELs overlap with tRNAs, AID* MELs are disproportionately overrepresented, with 228 of 275 tRNA genes being highly targeted (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

While the differences in mutation frequency between mRNA promoters and tRNAs is still statistically significant for A3G* (p value &lt; 8e-10), this effect is less pronounced. Enhanced mutation is also observed in the promoters of snoRNA and snRNA genes, again particularly in the case of AID* genomes, whereas no statistically significant differences are observed between any of the promoter subsets for mutations driven by EMS. The enhanced mutation attributable to AID* is not likely a feature of RNAP III, since snoRNAs are even more targeted for mutation though all but snR52 are transcribed by RNAP II (<a href=\"#bib39\">Moqtaderi and Struhl, 2004</a>)."

We see no such difference with AID* target motifs which are present within tRNA, snRNA and snoRNA gene promoters at similar frequency as in other promoters (average 52 to 63 motifs per 550 base pairs promoter window, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

By including repeatedly mapped reads across the rDNA locus, we could detect several hundred mutations at low allele frequency all within the expected deaminase mutation context, giving confidence in their detection and location (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Mutations were restricted to the well defined ribosomal replication fork barrier (rRFB) located between the 5S and 35S transcriptional units. No enhanced mutation was detected at the promoter regions (which are transcribed in opposite directions by RNAP III and RNAP I respectively). However mutations clustered at the rRFB site for both deaminases (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), at a site where induced homologous recombination maintains the size of the ribosomal gene array. Although DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) have been detected at the site, it is likely that in vivo persistent breaks are rare in undamaged yeast (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fritsch et al., 2010</a>). Accordingly we did not detect kataegic like clusters in the region, but rather localised mutated hotspots. Thus it is possible that other mechanisms such as cryptic transcription (<a href=\"#bib22\">Houseley et al., 2007</a>) might expose the site to the action of the deaminases, rather than repair of double strand breaks. While AID overexpression in yeast deficient for components of the RNA processing machinery (THO) have enhanced genomic instability, particularly in highly transcribed GC-rich regions prone to R-loop formation (<a href=\"#bib18\">G\u00f3mez-Gonz\u00e1lez and Aguilera, 2007</a>), in wild type yeast this effect is only mild. Nonetheless we observe positive association of MELs with predicted R-loop potential genes although the paucity of these features across the genomes (between 59\u201378 sites) precludes any predictive dissociation between high density of mutation, R-loop potential and transcription rates (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

                                "text": "An alternative explanation for the enhanced targeting of small RNA promoters by AID* is that the RNAs themselves preferentially bind AID, thereby creating co-transcriptional enrichment of AID in the vicinity of their genes. Purified AID binds RNA, with its in vitro deamination activity enhanced by treatment with RNAse A (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bransteitter et al., 2003</a>), whereas the non-catalytic domain of APOBEC3G is responsible for its ability to bind RNA and form high molecular weight ribonucleic\u2013protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huthoff et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00e9langer et al., 2013</a>). It is not known whether binding in both cases is specific for any particular RNA species, but based on our current observations we decided to test the ability of human AID and human APOBEC3G to bind in vitro transcribed tRNA as well as polyU RNA. Whereas both Flag-tagged overexpressed human AID and full length human APOBEC3G can be recovered from cell extracts by binding to biotin labelled RNAs, the catalytic domain of APOBEC3G (sA3G) is not (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Furthermore, full length APOBEC3G is efficiently recovered from extracts by the extended linear polyU RNA, a reflection of its ability to oligomerise in an RNA dependent fashion, whereas AID recovery is not enhanced by its binding to linear polyU RNA. Binding of AID to tRNA species was also found for endogenous yeast tRNAs, suggesting that the modifications found in vivo (pseudouridylation and 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation) do not affect the interaction. The single domain APOBEC3A protein shows no RNA binding ability except a limited amount to doubled stranded RNA, despite sharing the preferential targeting to promoters as the rest of the deaminases (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Taken together, this data suggest a degree of specificity in the RNA binding preferences of the deaminases, with AID preference linked to structured rather than linear RNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Interestingly the catalytic activity of AID is not required for the binding or the specificity, since similar binding was observed for the inactive mutant AID-E58A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

Despite subcellular compartmentalisation, specific targeting and restricted expression limiting AID off-target activity, some genomic regions other than the natural target, the immunoglobulin loci, are predisposed to mutation. BCL6, PIM1 and MYC are recurrent off-targets of AID mutation in B cell malignancies (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pasqualucci et al., 2001</a>); in the case of BCL6 it is estimated that AID induced mutations are also prevalent in non transformed B cells at just 10<sup>3</sup>-fold lower frequency than at immunoglobulin genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2008</a>) and even in the absence of the mutator phenotypes attributable to malignant transformation, normal B cells frequently show AID induced translocations at the MYC locus (<a href=\"#bib50\">Roschke et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Casellas et al., 2009</a>). In cancer genomes, the association of APOBEC mutations with genomic rearrangements suggests that replication stress, persistent DNA lesions and incomplete repair expose single stranded DNA that becomes a substrate for deaminases leading to clustered mutations. It is unclear how APOBEC3A and 3B gain access to single stranded DNA leading to the singlet isolated mutations highly prevalent in mutated cancer genomes that bear the APOBEC signature (<a href=\"#bib53\">Taylor et al., 2013</a>). It is therefore important to understand the genomic context that facilitates off-target activity of the deaminases in the absence of explicit DNA damage."

In this study we demonstrate the non-random nature of the mutations induced by the deaminases, which is remarkably focussed to just 1.5% of the yeast genome but nonetheless overlaps more than half of the active promoters. AID is known to interact with components of the transcription machinery in mammalian cells (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib27\">Kenter, 2012</a>). However, the overlap between highly mutated promoters by both AID and APOBEC3G suggests that rather than conservation of protein\u2013protein interactions of the deaminases with the transcription complex, properties of the promoter itself can determine targeting."

Indeed, the site of polymerase loading (within the body of the tRNA genes) rather than the TSS is the preferred target of deamination in the case of the RNAP III transcribed tRNAs in contrast to the 5\u2032 region of the RNAP III transcribed <i>SNR52</i> snoRNA, where the loading of the RNAP is fixed at the 5\u2032 promoter region. Furthermore, the high density of mutations focussed to the small region between the TATA binding protein site (TBP) and the transcription start site (TSS), more precisely identify the pre-initiation complex (PIC) as the target for the deaminases."

Therefore it is highly significant that other nucleosome free regions, such as ARS are not targeted by the deaminases, despite undergoing DNA melting during the initiation of replication. This reinforces our interpretation that intrinsic properties of active promoters, in particular the configuration associated with loading of the polymerase at the pre-initiation complex (open pre-initiation complex) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gr\u00fcnberg et al., 2012</a>), are sufficient to generate persistent single stranded DNA accessible for deamination.

Mammalian promoters are frequently regulated by proximal pausing, with most promoters pausing within 200 base pairs of the TSS (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman and Lis, 2012</a>). In the presence of a deaminase, initiating and or paused sites would become accessible for mutation, thus it is intriguing to observe promoter proximal enrichment of mutations at TpC dinucleotides in PD4120a, a breast cancer genome with dramatic accumulation of kataegis that betrays its mutagenesis by APOBEC3B (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</a>). Our data favours the idea that accessibility of single stranded DNA at RNAP II stalled sites suffice to recruit APOBECs or indeed AID. This model offers explanation for the association of AID with mammalian SPT5, which functions in modulating the pausing of RNAP II during elongation as transcription stalls, and is consistent with the recurrent targeting by AID of the promoter proximal region of MYC (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duquette et al., 2005</a>) a well characterised promoter-proximal pausing regulated gene (<a href=\"#bib31\">Krumm et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Strobl and Eick, 1992</a>)."

Indeed the enhanced targeting of tRNA, snoRNAs and snRNA genes could reflect the high transcription rates of these essential RNAs given that RNAP I and III transcripts constitute almost 80% of the total nuclear gene expression in dividing cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Vannini, 2013</a>). The unexpected finding that tRNAs are disproportionally targeted for mutation by AID compared with APOBEC3G, as are the promoters of other highly structured RNAs (snRNA or snoRNA), and the indication that this difference is not due to motif enrichment at those promoters, brings into focus the potential involvement of the RNA binding properties of the deaminases in promoting targeting. While APOBEC3G has been shown to bind not only HIV RNA, but cellular RNAs, including abundant 7S RNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huthoff et al., 2009</a>), this ability is dependent on the N-terminal domain. Mutation targeting of the RNAP initiation complex is not linked to the ability of the deaminases to bind RNA per se, as the catalytic C-terminal domain of APOBEC3G in this study is inert regarding RNA binding. Notably, our results show that AID binds structured RNAs in vitro (such as tRNAs), and preferentially targets tRNAs and other small RNA promoters for mutation in yeast, prompting the speculation that binding to abundant RNAs sequesters AID to subnuclear localities such as nucleolar areas, where small RNAs genes also localise during transcription. Indeed nucleolar localisation of overexpressed AID has been reported in mammalian cells, although its significance under physiological levels remains to be tested (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). Alternatively preferential recognition of particular RNA structures such as folded tRNAs could determine the recruitment of AID to genomic regions."

Mutable motifs were the total number of WRC, YCC, or C bases for AID*, sA3G* and EMS respectively. The 99<sup>th</sup> percentile was used as a threshold to identify significantly mutated windows and adjacent windows merged. To refine the span of each individual mutation enriched loci (MEL), unmutated residues and residues falling in the following categories were removed and the window size adjusted: bases that had a count below the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of all the counts in the window; bases which had a mutation count below four standard deviations from the average for the window and all bases with only a single detected mutation (where the median mutation count was above one). A final threshold was applied so that only regions with more than 5 mutations derived from at least four independent transformants were assigned as high confidence MELs.

Despite the limitations that yeast may have as a system to make conclusions about the in vivo action of these deaminases in human cells, it is clear that this type of approach reveals important features of the genome accessibility for these enzymes known to act specifically on ssDNA. In yeast, the pattern of mutations induced by these deaminases has been reported by different laboratories. This manuscript of Taylor and Rada, from the former laboratory of M. Neuberger, extends such studies further. A detailed analysis of clustering of mutations along the genome of diploid yeast reveals that such clusters are preferentially located at promoters of highly expressed RNAPII-driven genes. This is the case for both AID and APOBEC3G-induced mutations, and in the case of AID this is also observed for RNAPIII genes. Taylor and Rada conclude that this is due to the ability of the small RNAs to bring AID to its site of action. To probe this hypothesis they show that AID binds in vitro to yeast tRNA and poly U. This work is interesting and novel by providing new information about the yeast genome accessibility to human deaminases that should help clarify its mechanism of action. It is consistent with the ability of these enzymes to act on ssDNA formed at active pre-initiation complexes."

The current literature in mammalian cells regarding association of AID with chromatin (as measured by ChIP) is complicated. The most solid data shows association of AID at the S\u00b5 switch repeat region [a region that is highly enriched for AID targets] which is regulated by phosphorylation (Vuong et al 2013).
