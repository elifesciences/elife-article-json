Here we utilise phantom sensations and ultra high-field neuroimaging to uncover preserved, though latent, representation of amputees\u2019 missing hand. We show that representation of the missing hand\u2019s individual fingers persists in the primary somatosensory cortex even decades after arm amputation. By demonstrating stable topography despite amputation, our finding questions the extent to which continued sensory input is necessary to maintain organisation in sensory cortex, thereby reopening the question what happens to a cortical territory once its main input is lost. The discovery of persistent digit topography of amputees\u2019 missing hand could be exploited for the development of intuitive and fine-grained control of neuroprosthetics, requiring neural signals of individual digits."

Here we utilise phantom sensations and ultra high-field neuroimaging to uncover preserved, though latent, representation of amputees\u2019 missing hand. We show that representation of the missing hand\u2019s individual fingers persists in the primary somatosensory cortex even decades after arm amputation. By demonstrating stable topography despite amputation, our finding questions the extent to which continued sensory input is necessary to maintain organisation in sensory cortex, thereby reopening the question what happens to a cortical territory once its main input is lost. The discovery of persistent digit topography of amputees\u2019 missing hand could be exploited for the development of intuitive and fine-grained control of neuroprosthetics, requiring neural signals of individual digits."

Each of the forward and backward runs was repeated twice. The numbers 1\u20135 and colours correspond to the five digits, as visualised in the right side of the panel. (<b>B</b>) Preprocessed BOLD time courses from individual voxels (the\u00a0example time course of one voxel is shown in red) were cross-correlated against a reference model. The model corresponded to a single-digit movement (9\u00a0s \u2018on\u2019, 36\u00a0s \u2018off\u2019- the period of movement of all other digits), and was systematically shifted in time to model activity throughout a full cycle (30 shifts, corresponding to the 30 lags of the 45\u00a0s cycle). The figure shows three different model lags (1, 12 and 24), resulting in varying cross-correlation outcomes. Lag 24 was the optimal model lag for this preprocessed BOLD time course. (<b>C</b>) The standardised r-values (Fisher\u2019s r-to-z, y-axis) resulting from the cross-correlation were plotted as a function of lag (x-axis) for each individual voxel in each run. In the left panel, cross-correlation values from the example voxel shown in B are plotted for each of the four runs. The optimal fit for the voxel is demonstrated by the peak cross-correlation (digit 1, in the left panel; digit 2 in the right panel, taken from separate voxels). Lags associated with the same digits were averaged, first within and then across runs. A winner-take-all approach was used to determine digit preference, based on the highest average r-value, resulting in five separate digit maps. False discovery rate (FDR) was applied for each of these single digit maps to adjust the threshold based on the criterion q (FDR) &lt;\u00a00.05. (<b>D</b>) Each of the five digits was assigned a colour code, as demonstrated on the left. The five digit maps were projected to the cortical surface, to display digit preference maps. Note that no masking was applied when presenting the resulting maps. Within the resulting five-digit map a gradient of progression across digits was visualised, based on the voxel-wise r-values for each of the 30 lags. The resulting map was located in the central sulcus and postcentral gyrus, corresponding to the primary somatosensory cortex, around the anatomical hand knob."

Participants pressed the button box with the relevant digit using a travelling wave paradigm (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since this task did not involve any difficulty for the amputees, as it only consisted of moving digits of the intact hand, all participants were paced to perform button press movements with individual digits at a set (1\u00a0Hz) frequency, as indicated by the flashing of the corresponding circle at the specified rate. A forward and backward sequence was employed in separate runs. Each of the forward and backward runs was repeated twice, for a total duration of 25\u00a0min and 40\u00a0s.

To further confirm the existence of the missing hand map independently of intact hand contributions (<a href=\"#bib28\">Makin et al., 2013b</a>),\u00a0we designed an opposing bimanual travelling wave task. Participants performed paired movements with digits of the phantom and intact hands in reverse sequences (i.e. one hand moved from\u00a0digit\u00a01 to digit\u00a05, while the other simultaneously moved from\u00a0digit\u00a05 to digit\u00a01; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Both amputees showed maps in the hemisphere contralateral to the intact hand, dissociated from a second map in the missing hand hemisphere (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). The latter map corresponded to the original (unimanual movements,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) missing hand map, as confirmed by higher spatial correspondence for 'same' (average Dice overlap coefficient: 0.49, 0.40 for above and below elbow amputees) versus 'different' (0.06, 0.04) digit clusters across the two (unimanual and bimanual) missing hand datasets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This provides a replication for the preserved missing hand map. This result also demonstrates the independence of the missing hand topography from the representation of the intact hand. Our group and others previously showed that following unilateral arm amputation, the intact hand becomes over-represented in the missing hand territory (<a href=\"#bib28\">Makin et al., 2013b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib38\">Philip and Frey, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Raffin et al., 2016</a>). Our results therefore confirm that the digit map in the missing hand territory is not driven by an emerging representation of the intact hand. Note, however, that our results do not exclude the possibility for reorganisation in the missing hand territory. As demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, this study\u2019s participants showed over-representation of their intact hand in the missing hand territory, indicating that the preserved missing hand topography can co-occur with remapping of body parts."

For this purpose, we employed an independent dataset, acquired using standard field neuroimaging (acquisition parameters were identical to those described for the standard field imaging in the materials and methods section, with the exception of the number of acquisition volumes). (<b>A</b>) Participants were cued to perform movements with their intact hand (simultaneous flexion and extension of all five digits), or dominant hand in controls (n = 15), as part of a block-design protocol, used to identify body-part representations (see [<a href=\"#bib28\">Makin et al., 2013b</a>]\u00a0for details of a similar protocol). This movement condition was contrasted against a baseline (rest) period and standardised (z) beta values during intact/dominant hand movements were extracted from the peak voxel within a postcentral gyrus (PCG) mask in the contralateral hemisphere. To identify the estimated position of the missing hand territory, this peak voxel was mirror flipped on the axial plane, and the standardised beta value for intact hand activity was extracted from this ROI in the ipsilateral hemisphere. (<b>B</b>) To assess asymmetry in intact hand activity across the two hemispheres, the following inter-hemispheric asymmetry index was calculated for each of the three amputees and 15 controls individually: (contralateral hemisphere \u2013 ipsilateral hemisphere) / (contralateral hemisphere + ipsilateral hemisphere). Higher values of this index indicate that the activity pattern for the intact hand was greater in the contralateral, compared to the ipsilateral, sensorimotor hand area, as found was\u00a0in the control participants. Lower values in this index represent less asymmetry, resulting from (relatively) higher activity in the ipsilateral hand area during intact hand movements. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The above elbow and brachial plexus amputees showed significantly lower asymmetry than controls (one-tailed Crawford and Howell t-test [<a href=\"#bib6\">Corballis, 2009</a>]; t<sub>(14)</sub> = \u22121.84, p = 0.04; and t<sub>(14)</sub> = \u22121.96, p = 0.04 respectively). The below elbow amputee showed a high asymmetry value, similar to controls (one-tailed Crawford and Howell t-test (<a href=\"#bib6\">Corballis, 2009</a>); t<sub>(14)</sub> = 1.26, p = 0.11). This indicates that two of the tested amputees show over-representation of their intact hand in the missing hand territory, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib28\">Makin et al., 2013b</a>).\u00a0These results suggest that the missing hand maps can be preserved while reorganisation of displaced inputs from the intact hand has taken place."

This approach fully reveals the intricate overlap pattern across all digits (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ejaz et al., 2015</a>), as shown for controls in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>. In general, both amputees showed greater average overlap across digits (0.55 and 0.54 for above and below elbow amputees respectively), compared to controls (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.24\u20130.41).

For example, following arm amputation, the missing hand territory in S1 is taken over by representations of other body parts (e.g. the neighbouring representation of the face in monkeys [<a href=\"#bib39\">Pons et al., 1991</a>], or the intact hand in humans [<a href=\"#bib28\">Makin et al., 2013b</a>]).\u00a0Conversely, recent research in the visual cortex suggests that reorganisation in the adult brain may be restricted. For example following macular degeneration, the functional representation of the intact visual field was unchanged ([<a href=\"#bib1\">Baseler et al., 2011</a>], see [<a href=\"#bib49\">Smirnakis et al., 2005</a>] for similar results in non-human primates). Common to all these previous studies aiming to characterise reorganisation or the lack thereof, is that the authors probed the cortical neighbours of the area previously responsible for processing the lost input. While this approach is suitable for documenting shifted representation of the cortical neighbours, it leaves unexplored the possibility that the original function of the region deprived of sensory input may be preserved, though latent. Amputees experiencing phantom sensations provide a unique model to study what happens to the deprived cortical territory itself during sensory input loss. Here we show that reorganisation in the missing hand territory following input loss does not abolish the original functional layout in sensory cortex."

Already in their seal work Merzenich et al. suggested that reorganisation following sensory input loss does not exclude the possibility for simultaneous preservation of the original function of that region (<a href=\"#bib32\">Merzenich et al., 1984</a>). Accordingly, recent structural and functional evidence shows that the capacity for S1 reorganisation is more limited than initially thought, and that instead the functional changes previously observed in S1 following input loss could be attributed to reorganisation in sub-cortical areas in the afferent pathway, principally the brainstem (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jain et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kambi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chand and Jain, 2015</a>). In other words, previous findings of massive cortical reorganisation in S1 reflect reorganisation of inputs, rather than reorganisation within S1 itself. This recent evident nicely complements our own finding of SI reorganisation, overlaid on preserved structure and function."

The variability in the level and nature of amputations in this study\u2019s cohort allows us to consider the potential contribution of the peripheral nervous system in the preservation of missing hand topography. In the below elbow amputee, some forearm muscles normally controlling hand movements are spared and therefore proprioceptive inputs relating to phantom hand movements likely persist (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nystr\u00f6m and Hagbarth, 1981</a>). In the above elbow amputee, these inputs would be absent, though ectopic firing from the injured nerve (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nystr\u00f6m and Hagbarth, 1981</a>) or intact dorsal root ganglia could preserve some afferent inputs (as previously shown following peripheral nerve injury [<a href=\"#bib35\">Nordin et al., 1984</a>], see also [<a href=\"#bib53\">Vaso et al., 2014</a>] for related findings). However, in the amputee suffering from brachial plexus avulsion injury, the dorsal root ganglia are damaged, meaning that no such peripheral input should be available. Given the observation of preserved topography in all three cases, it is highly probable that the preserved missing hand maps are not maintained by peripheral input, but rather are driven by processing in the central nervous system itself."

Given the relatively unimpaired motor system in amputees, it is possible that these representations are driven by motor (efferent) information. The motor system is thought to provide information about its descending commands to the sensory system, by means of efference copy. When efference signals reach the sensory areas, they evoke activity in those areas. The pattern of this corollary discharge could resemble that of the sensory feedback to be expected from the movement (<a href=\"#bib26\">London and Miller, 2013</a>). While predictive signals are fundamental components for current theories of motor control (<a href=\"#bib15\">Franklin and Wolpert, 2011</a>), surprisingly little empirical evidence exists to demonstrate efferent signals in the primates\u2019 S1 hand representation independently of afferent processing (<a href=\"#bib26\">London and Miller, 2013</a>). Our evidence for digit topography in S1 despite the physical absence of a hand suggests the involvement of non-afferent processing in S1.

However, we note that these previous studies do not provide information on whether the topographic features underlying the phantom-evoked activity were preserved. Further research is needed to determine whether the preservation of missing hand topography depends on (or gives rise to) the experience of phantom sensations, or whether our finding reflects a fundamental organising principle of the brain that is independent of experience."

However, the relevant information necessary for intuitive neuroprosthesis control may not be attainable once input is lost and functional reorganisation occurs.

It was clearly stated to the amputees that they were required to perform actual movements with their phantom digits (i.e. try and move the digits of the missing hand), rather than motor imagery. To ensure good understanding of these instructions, the amputees were asked to demonstrate to the experimenter outside the scanner the extent of volitional movement carried out in each of their phantom digits, by mirroring each movement onto their intact hand. For the below elbow amputee, stump muscles were palpated by the experimenter outside the scanner to verify that actual movements were executed during movement of the phantom digits."

The approach is based on continuous presentation of stimuli in a set cycle that are expected to result in neighbouring cortical representations (e.g. rotating wedge in the visual field; sequential digit stimulation in a set cycle). It is designed to capture voxels showing increased response to one condition, above and beyond all other conditions (in our case, preference for a specific digit). Beyond preference, this technique also provides a powerful tool for capturing the smooth progression of adjacent representations that are typical for topographic maps. It is therefore considered a preferable technique for capturing topographic representations (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wandell et al., 2007</a>).

Activity patterns are decomposed within the ROI into a common (noise) component that is shared between all trials and one specific component for each of the five digits. By estimating the variability (or strength) of the similarity between the latter components, the inter-digit representational overlap in the ROI is revealed. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> for standard field) show the resulting matrices, demonstrating the level of representational similarity (or overlap) between each digit pair. The topographic inter-digit pattern is characterised by increased overlap between neighbouring digits. Furthermore, digits showing increased synergies in daily life (e.g. digits 3 and 4) tend to show greater representational overlap than digits that are more independent during hand function (e.g. digits 1 and 2) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ejaz et al., 2015</a>). The resulting inter-digit representational overlap pattern therefore provides a detailed 'fingerprint' of hand representation. We initially assessed overall (mean) overlap within the matrix of each participant, by averaging all unique inter-digit similarity r-values (across the 10 cells of the matrix, while excluding the diagonal). On average, the amputees showed higher inter-digit overlap (0.55 and 0.54 for above and below elbow amputees, respectively) than the control group (CI: 0.24\u20130.41). To investigate whether the missing hand inter-digit overlap pattern was comparable to normal hand representation, as found in controls, we generated the distribution (and 95% confidence intervals) of correlation across the control population. For this purpose, inter-digit overlap patterns (i.e. the cells in the similarity matrices) were correlated across pairs of controls, using a bootstrapping approach (10,000 iterations) and a Spearman test. One control participant was discarded from the subsequent analysis, as his mean Spearman correlation value (with all other controls) fell outside two standard deviations from the control group mean. (Note that the exclusion of the outlier participant did not affect the outcome of this analysis.) Next, the same procedure was carried out between each amputee and each of the controls\u2019 inter-digit overlap patterns. By plotting the average amputee-control Spearman rho values and confidence intervals against the confidence interval of the controls-to-controls correlation distribution, we were able to show that the amputees\u2019 inter-digit representational overlap pattern fell within the normal range of the controls. There was no significant difference between the amputees-to-controls average Spearman correlation and the control-to-control correlations also when using more conventional statistics (two-tailed Crawford and Howell t-test [<a href=\"#bib6\">Corballis, 2009</a>]; t<sub>(9)</sub> = \u22121.10, p=0.30 and t<sub>(9)</sub> = 0.31, p=0.76 for above and below elbow amputees respectively)."

They point out that, had these findings been published 30 years ago, they would not have been regarded as surprising. It was not before the work of M. Merzenich in 1980 that evidence became available against the \"hard-wired dogma\" of adult brains. However, this has not been fully replaced with a \"soft-wired dogma\" since then; rather, it is widely recognised that both aspects coexist. While it has become clear that the brain has considerable capacity for functional reorganisation and plasticity even in adult life (for example, concerning somatotopy, electrophysiological work has demonstrated that neurons are partially able to acquire new receptive fields after deafferenting a digit etc.), there are hardly claims or data suggesting a full loss of digit somatotopy. By contrast, some authors have claimed that individual digit topography can be detected by touching the face of some amputees. In brief, reorganization and preserved digit somatotopy are not mutually exclusive, but reflect a balance of stability and plasticity in the CNS. The reviewers think that this is exactly what the statistical results reflect (see point 2 above) and find that a more balanced interpretation and discussion is necessary. The present conclusions (including the abstract) oversimplify and are worded too strongly."

Understanding the pathway of activation is further challenged by the differences in the 3 cases presented here. In the below-elbow case, it is likely that portions of the extensor digitorum communis (finger raising) and flexor digitorum profundus (finger curling) muscles as well as their afferent and efferent innervation remain and were activated during the 'imagined' movements, which could probably be better described as 'executed' (muscle) movements. In this case, one might imagine the involvement of M-I to S-I connections, along with all the complexities of the difference between muscles located in the arm versus glabrous skin on the underside of the fingers. But in the above-elbow case, those finger muscles in the arm are gone; although dorsal root ganglion cells formerly innervating glabrous finger skin as well as motorneurons formerly innervating those muscles are likely to have persisted above the injury, and may have made ectopic connections. Finally, the brachial plexus avulsion case would likely have involved damage to the dorsal root ganglia and the spinal cord itself. In that case, the most peripheral source of abnormal neural activity could only have been neurons in the dorsal horn itself."

Recent experiments on non-human primates with chronic lesions of the dorsal column subserving the arm have suggested that our initial expectations for sites of plastiticy may not have been correct (for example, P Chand and N Jain (2015) Intracortical and thalamocortical connections of the hand and face representations in somatosensory area 3b of macaque monkeys and effects of chronic spinal cord injuries. Journal of Neuroscience 35:13475-13486.) That study showed that despite the electrophysiological presence of large-scale somatotopic reorganization in 3b, surprisingly, there was no evidence for any marked increase in cortico-cortical connections across the hand-face border in 3b, <i>or</i> any evidence of altered map connections from the hand and face parts of the ventrobasal nucleus to the cortex. So the large-scale expansion of the chin representation into the deafferented hand representation in 3b may actually instead have been driven by the reorganization of the dorsal column nuclei. In the context of the present paper, this suggests that reorganized inputs to cortical maps should strongly be distinguished from the intrinsic organization of the cortical maps themselves, which contrary to expectations, may turn out to be <i>less</i> plastic than more peripheral stations.\""

According to this paper, a Bayes Factor (BF) under 0.33 provides coherent evidence to support the null hypothesis. This criterion is consistent with the results found in two of the amputees. A BF between 0.33 and 3 should be interpreted as ambiguous evidence (neither confirming or rejecting the null hypothesis), as found in the third amputee. This BF criterion is currently used as a standard in the field. For example, in a key paper by Wetzels et al. (Wetzels et al., 2011), a BF greater than 3 (or lower than 0.33) is considered substantial evidence for (or against) the hypothesis. In this paper, a BF of 3 is shown to correspond to a p value of 0.01. In the guidelines by Kass and Raftery (Kass and Raftery, 1995), where a criterion of BF &gt; 20 is suggested as strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis, a BF greater than 3 is still considered positive evidence (thus validating out interpretation for BF &lt; 0.33).

For example, in the original digit reorganisation paper by Merzenich et al. (Merzenich et al., 1984), the authors suggested that phantom sensations most likely arise from a preserved functional representation of the missing digit \u2013 therefore not excluding the potential for persistent organisation co-occurring with reorganisation. However, evidence to support this co-existence of preserved organisation and reorganisation are only now beginning to emerge (see point 7 for further discussion of how the visual community resolves between the hard- and soft-wired dogmas; see also point 6b for further discussion of how reorganisation and preserved representation can co-occur following sensory input loss). We believe that the discrepancy between the theoretical framework, embracing the co-occurrence of preservation and plasticity, and the mainstream evidence in favour of plasticity, is due to methodological limitations. Once the main input is lost to a brain area, scientists resort to studying representations of its cortical neighbours to best characterise the freed-up territory (e.g. adjacent digits, arm or face in primates following digit or arm deafferentation (Merzenich et al., 1984; Pons et al., 1991; Kambi et al., 2014)(1); neighbouring whiskers in rodents following whisker removal (2,3); or peripheral visual representation in humans with foveal visual loss (Baseler et al., 2011)). This approach leaves unexplored the possibility that the original function of the region may be preserved, though latent. Our experimental approach therefore provides a new perspective on the capacity for the brain to maintain hard-wired representation despite a drastic change in inputs. We revised the discussion of the manuscript to better reflect the existing theoretical framework. For example, we discuss previous literature in the visual field suggesting limits of plasticity in the adult human brain (see also point 7) and explain how our research advances on these findings."

Already in their seminal work Merzenich et al. suggested that reorganisation following sensory input loss does not exclude the possibility for simultaneous preservation of the original function of that region (Merzenich et al., 1984). Accordingly, recent structural and functional evidence shows that the capacity for S1 reorganisation is more limited than initially thought, and that instead the functional changes previously observed in S1 following input loss could be attributed to reorganisation in sub-cortical areas in the afferent pathway, principally the brainstem (Jain, Catania and Kaas, 1998; Kambi et al., 2014; Chand and Jain, 2015). In other words, previous findings of massive cortical reorganisation in S1 reflect reorganisation of inputs, rather than reorganisation within S1 itself. This recent evident nicely complements our own finding of SI reorganisation, overlaid on preserved structure and function.\u201d"

Indeed, further studies that avoided some of these methodological pitfalls showed that referred sensations could be triggered by touch applied on body parts that are not cortical neighbours of the hand area (e.g. feet, chest and neck), as well as body parts that are contralateral to the missing hand (6, 7). As such, we felt there is insufficient evidence to link referred sensations and SI organisation and/or reorganisation.

We showed that 16 of 17 individuals were able to activate the missing hand territory when moving (or attempting to move) their phantom hand. Although these studies were not suited to resolve whether this activity reflected topographic organisation, they hint that persistent representation may be the rule, rather than the exception. Nevertheless, it is still possible that the features of the preserved topography (e.g. overlap across digits, digit preferences) may depend upon (or drive) phantom sensations. In the revised manuscript we highlight our previous finding and discuss the potential causal link between phantom sensations and preserved topography. We are currently running a new study to tackle this important research question and hope that we will be able to shed more light on this interesting question in the future."

The variability in the level and nature of amputations in this study\u2019s cohort allows us to consider the potential contribution of the peripheral nervous system in the preservation of missing hand topography. In the below elbow amputee, some forearm muscles normally controlling hand movements are spared and therefore proprioceptive inputs relating to phantom hand movements likely persist (Nystrom and Hagbarth, 1981). In the above elbow amputee, these inputs would be absent, though ectopic firing from the injured nerve (Nystrom and Hagbarty, 1981) or intact dorsal root ganglia could preserve some afferent inputs (as previously shown following peripheral nerve injury (Nordin et al., 1984), see also (Vaso et al., 2014) for related findings). However, in the amputee suffering from brachial plexus avulsion injury, the dorsal root ganglia are damaged, meaning that no such peripheral input should be available. Given the observation of preserved topography in all three cases, it is highly probable that the preserved missing hand maps are not maintained by peripheral input, but rather are driven by processing in the central nervous system itself.\u201d"

Recent experiments on non-human primates with chronic lesions of the dorsal column subserving the arm have suggested that our initial expectations for sites of plastiticy may not have been correct (for example, P Chand and N Jain (2015) Intracortical and thalamocortical connections of the hand and face representations in somatosensory area 3b of macaque monkeys and effects of chronic spinal cord injuries. Journal of Neuroscience 35:13475-13486.)
