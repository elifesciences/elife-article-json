The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> divides by multiple fission, wherein a \u2018counting\u2019 mechanism couples mother cell-size to cell division number allowing production of uniform-sized daughters. We identified a sizer protein, CDKG1, that acts through the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway as a D-cyclin-dependent RB kinase to regulate mitotic counting. Loss of CDKG1 leads to fewer mitotic divisions and large daughters, while mis-expression of CDKG1 causes supernumerous mitotic divisions and small daughters. The concentration of nuclear-localized CDKG1 in pre-mitotic cells is set by mother cell size, and its progressive dilution and degradation with each round of cell division may provide a link between mother cell-size and mitotic division number. Cell-size-dependent accumulation of limiting cell cycle regulators such as CDKG1 is a potentially general mechanism for size control."

The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> divides by multiple fission, wherein a \u2018counting\u2019 mechanism couples mother cell-size to cell division number allowing production of uniform-sized daughters. We identified a sizer protein, CDKG1, that acts through the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway as a D-cyclin-dependent RB kinase to regulate mitotic counting. Loss of CDKG1 leads to fewer mitotic divisions and large daughters, while mis-expression of CDKG1 causes supernumerous mitotic divisions and small daughters. The concentration of nuclear-localized CDKG1 in pre-mitotic cells is set by mother cell size, and its progressive dilution and degradation with each round of cell division may provide a link between mother cell-size and mitotic division number. Cell-size-dependent accumulation of limiting cell cycle regulators such as CDKG1 is a potentially general mechanism for size control."

Larger mother cells undergo more divisions than smaller mother cells in order to produce daughter cells of a correct size. Using a range of genetic and biochemical techniques, Li, Liu et al. identified a protein that is produced in Chlamydomonas cells just before they begin to divide. Larger mother cells contain more of this protein than smaller cells and the protein encourages cells to divide. For example, mutant cells that lack this protein divided too few times, while cells that produce too much of it divided too many times."

These include a regulatory loop involving accumulation of G1 cyclins and the removal of the inhibitory protein Whi5p from the transcriptional activator SBF that controls S phase entry (<a href=\"#bib10\">Costanzo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">de Bruin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Di Talia et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Schmoller et al., 2015</a>). A phosphatase, Rts1p, appears to function upstream of this loop through the transcription factor Ace2 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Di Talia et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zapata et al., 2014</a>). Budding yeast cell size control is also influenced by ribosome biogenesis that acts to modulate growth rate and the critical size at which cells enter S-phase (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernstein et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gomez-Herreros et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jorgensen et al., 2004</a>). It is still unclear what is the parameter monitored by size checkpoints in budding yeast. In fission yeast, it was proposed that cell size is controlled by polar localization of the kinase Pom1 that establishes an inhibitory gradient which blocks the initiation of cytokinesis in the mid-cell region, thereby establishing a minimum length for cells prior to division (<a href=\"#bib46\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Moseley et al., 2009</a>). However, this result has been challenged by new work showing that cells may instead sense their surface area through the local concentration of a kinase cdr2p (<a href=\"#bib16\">Deng et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pan et al., 2014</a>). One complication in yeasts is that size thresholds for cell cycle transitions are modulated by cell growth rates, a property that adds an additional layer of complexity to size control networks in fungi (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Turner et al., 2012</a>)."

Like many chlorophyte algae and diverse unicellular eukaryotes, Chlamydomonas cells proliferate using a multiple fission cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bisova and Zachleder, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cavalier-Smith, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cross and Umen, 2015</a>). Multiple fission is characterized by a prolonged G1 period during which cells can grow more than ten-fold in size. At the end of G1 mother cells undergo a series of rapid alternating S phases and mitoses (S/M) to produce 2<sup>n</sup> uniform-sized daughters (<a href=\"#bib76\">Umen, 2005</a>). Size control is evident during S/M because larger mother cells divide more times than smaller mother cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Craigie and Cavalier-Smith, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Donnan and John, 1983</a>). Although size control mutants have been identified as described below, the mechanisms by which mother cells 'count' the correct number divisions or regulate daughter cell-size remain unclear. A second key attribute of multiple fission is that in diurnally-synchronized cultures growth occurs during the light period, while S/M phase occurs during the dark period with no additional growth of newborn daughter cells until the next light period. Under these conditions daughter cell-size is a direct readout of the mitotic size control mechanism (<a href=\"#bib76\">Umen, 2005</a>)."

Mutants that are missing the retinoblastoma related (RBR) protein MAT3 pass commitment at an abnormally small size, remain in G1 for a normal post-commitment length of time, and then divide too many times during S/M to produce small daughters. These defects can be suppressed by mutations in <i>DP1</i> or <i>E2F1</i> that encode subunits of a conserved heterodimeric E2F-DP transcription factor that binds directly to MAT3/RBR to form a stable complex (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Olson et al., 2010</a>).

CDKG1 is a nuclear-localized, D-cyclin dependent MAT3/RBR kinase whose mutant and mis-expression phenotypes indicate that its abundance is limiting for mother cell division number and mitotic size control. The production of CDKG1 was found to scale with mother cell size and was partially regulated through its long 3\u2019 untranslated region. After each round of mitosis the amount of CDKG1 protein per nucleus decreased until it disappeared upon mitotic exit. Cell-size-dependent production of regulatory proteins is a potentially general means of linking cell size to downstream cell cycle events."

Previous phylogenetic analyses suggested that CDKG1 is a member of a unique CDK sub-family (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bisova et al., 2005</a>). To better understand its phylogenetic relationship to other CDKs, we generated a maximum-likelihood phylogeny of kinase domains from CDKG1 and other CDKs including metazoan RB kinases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bisova et al., 2005</a>). Our results show that CDKG1 and its distant paralog, CDKG2, belong to a novel subfamily of CDKs that are distinct from the eukaryotic CDK1/CDKA clade and more divergent from CDK1/CDKA than the plant-specific CDKB and animal-specific CDK2 subfamilies. On the other hand, the CDKG family is more closely related to core cell cycle CDKs of animals and plants than the CDK4/6 family of RB kinases from animals. Together these data indicate that CDKG1 might function as a specialized cell cycle CDK."

Chlamydomonas has one A-type cyclin (CYCA1), one B-type cyclin (CYCB1), one hybrid-A/B-type cyclin (CYCAB1), and four D-type cyclins (CYCD1-CYCD4) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bisova et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Prochnik et al., 2010</a>). Full-length cDNAs of <i>CYCA1, CYCB1, CYCD2, CYCD3 and CYCD4</i> were successfully amplified through RT-PCR and used for Y2H testing with CDKG1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). <i>CYCA1, CYCB1, CYCD2</i> and <i>CYCD3</i> are most highly expressed cyclins in Chlamydomonas while <i>CYCD4</i> and <i>CYCD1</i> are expressed at much lower levels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bisova et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Zones et al., 2015</a>). All three D-cyclins that could be tested by Y2H interacted with CDKG1, but CYCD2 and CYCD3 had much stronger signals than CYCD4. The putative S-phase and mitotic cyclins CYCA1 or CYCB1 had no detectable interactions with CDKG1 in this assay, but both were able to interact with CDKA1 and CDKB1 as anticipated from previous studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">De Veylder et al., 2007</a>)."

To test this possibility, we first developed an <i>in vitro</i> kinase assay with partially purified IVT HA-CDKG1 or a predicted kinase dead allele (HA-CDKG1<sup>kd</sup>), with and without added Myc-tagged CYCD3 (myc-CYCD3). GST-MAT3, GST, and histone H1 were used as substrates. By itself HA-CDKG1 exhibited some GST-MAT3 kinase activity that was consistently stimulated by around 1.7-fold in the presence of CYCD3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, lanes 2 and 4, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

Previously we were able to detect cell-cycle controlled phosphorylation of MAT3/RBR that could be qualitatively observed by migration changes on SDS-PAGE gels in synchronized cultures (<a href=\"#bib54\">Olson et al., 2010</a>). We constructed isogenic strains where a HA-tagged MAT3/RBR transgene was in a wild type or <i>cdkg1-2</i> background and compared the phosphorylation levels in daughters and in S/M phase populations. Although we observed S/M phase hyperphosphorylation of MAT3/RBR,\u00a0we did not observe a detectable change in MAT3/RBR phosphorylation in the <i>cdkg1-2</i> mutant compared with controls. These results\u00a0indicate that CDKG1 is not the predominant kinase for MAT3/RBR, and that like its animal homologs,\u00a0MAT3/RBR is likely to be a substrate for multiple CDKs\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

HA-CDKG1 was barely detectable in non-dividing control cells from population I (pre-Commitment cells, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> lanes 1, 2) indicating that its expression is correlated with cell division. In contrast, both small and large mother cells expressed CDKG1 just prior to and during cell division (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> lanes 3\u20136). Moreover, the amount of HA-CDKG1 that accumulated in small mother cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, lanes 3, 4) was lower than that in large mother cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> lanes 5, 6). This size-dependent difference was evident even when equal protein was loaded from each sample meaning that the total concentration of CDKG1 is higher in large versus small mother cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, upper panels, lanes 3, 4 versus 5, 6). Thus both cellular concentration and total amounts of CDKG1 per cell scale allometrically (i.e. non-linearly) with mother cell size. This allometric scaling relationship was also reflected in <i>CDKG1</i> mRNA abundance that also increased relative to an internal control in large versus small mother cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Compared to bulk protein observable on coomassie-stained gels CDKG1 accumulation does not scale linearly with mother cell size (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). We also asked whether the CDKG1 accumulation pattern was distinct from two other proteins, histone H3 and alpha-tubulin, neither of\u00a0which is expected to play a role in cell-size control. The alpha tubulin mRNA has\u00a0a cell cycle regulated accumulation pattern with a peak during S/M (<a href=\"#bib81\">Zones et al., 2015</a>) as does histone H3 (<a href=\"#bib78\">Waterborg et al., 1995</a>). Quantitative Western blotting from the same populations of non-dividing cells, small mother cells and large mother cells revealed that the scaling relationship of CDKG1 with cell cycle stage and cell size is different from histone H3 and tubulin where the former protein had an approximately fixed amount per cell and the latter was\u00a0produced proportionally to total protein biomass (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, the allometric accumulation pattern of CDKG1 where the amount made is not linear with respect to bulk protein and cell size suggests that its abundance in mother cells might be related to its role in cell size control."

We determined the relative nuclear concentration of HA-CDKG1 in dividing cells and found that it gradually decreased with each round of cell division (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). To determine whether the decline of nuclear CDKG1 concentration was attributable to dilution and/or protein turnover we first measured the nuclear volumes (N) and total cell volume (C) from mitotic cells in which a nuclear-localized ble-GFP fusion protein (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fuhrmann et al., 1999</a>) was constitutively expressed and used to mark the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). When we measured N/C in mitotic cells we found that it remained constant and that nuclear volume halved with each round of division (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This finding indicates that total nuclear volume in dividing cells is fixed, and that changes in CDKG1 concentration were due to a small but significant amount of net degradation as cells progressed through each round of division (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Importantly, all the CDKG1 protein that was synthesized in cells appears to have been made in mother cells just prior to S/M and it was not replaced as cells progressed through division. While the absolute concentration drop in CDKG1 was relatively shallow with each round of S/M, its concentration with respect to nuclear DNA dropped by more than two fold with each cell division (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) and this ratiometric decrease could potentially be used as a threshold signal to control mitotic exit."

As we observed for <i>PSAD:CKDG1<sup>kd</sup></i>, expression of <i>PL23:HA-CDKG1<sup>kd</sup></i> caused no cell size phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C and D</a>). Mis-expression of CDKG1 is likely to be detrimental or unstable since the small-cell phenotype and expression of the transgene were both lost upon repeated passage of <i>PL23:HA-CDKG1</i> cultures (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>), and this property may also account for the overall low frequency of obtaining transformants that mis-express <i>CDKG1</i>. Taken together our data indicate that CDKG1 is a limiting component of the normal S/M size control mechanism in Chlamydomonas, that its abundance is tightly controlled, and that its overexpression and/or prolonged expression during S/M phase causes extra cell divisions and a small-cell phenotype."

Key properties of CDKG1 indicate that it couples mother cell size to the extent of cell division during S/M (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Loss of function (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and mis-expression phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) show that while dispensable for overall cell cycle progression, CDKG1 is limiting for the normal number of S/M division cycles of mother cells and thereby acts as a determinant of daughter cell-size. The timing of CDKG1 expression is also consistent with its function as a size regulator during S/M phase: <i>CDKG1</i> message and protein accumulate in late G1 just before entry into S/M phase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>); nuclear CDKG1 is then diluted with each round of division until the end of S/M when it disappears in daughter cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A,E</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The loss of CDKG1 does not eliminate size control completely, but instead alters the normal set points that govern the relationship between mother cell size and cell division number. Thus, other mechanisms must exist that trigger exit from S/M in the absence of CDKG1, but do so prematurely. <i>cdkg1</i> mutant strains may be valuable for investigating this next layer of size control that operates when CDKG1 is missing."

                        "text": "In principle, the level of a size regulatory protein such as CDKG1 might scale linearly with mother cell size; however, instead we observed an allometric scaling relationship where large mother cells produce a higher total concentration of CDKG1 protein and mRNA than smaller mother cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, lanes 5, 6 versus 3, 4, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, <i>CDKG1</i> abundance was at least partly controlled by its 3\u2019 UTR that conferred a cell-cycle-specific expression pattern to a heterologous reporter gene similar to the expression pattern of endogenous <i>CDKG1</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We speculate that the unusually long and uridine-rich 3\u2019 UTR of <i>CDKG1</i> plays an essential role in CDKG1 accumulation in mother cells, likely through the control of mRNA stability. Control of mRNA stability of cell cycle regulators is an important mechanism operating in early embryonic development at the midblastula transition (<a href=\"#bib70\">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</a>), but less is known how mRNA stability impacts somatic cell cycles where mRNAs for cyclins and CDKs such as the <i>CCND1</i> and <i>CDK6</i> are subject to cell-cycle-stage dependent differential turnover (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deshpande et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sun et al., 2008</a>). Understanding how the 3\u2019 UTR of <i>CDKG1</i> confers a highly specific S/M phase expression pattern to its mRNA may shed light on how mRNA abundance is coupled to cell cycle progression in other contexts. Finally, we emphasize that mRNA abundance alone cannot explain the tightly controlled pattern of protein accumulation and degradation for CDKG1 where its\u00a0net synthesis is restricted to a narrow window of time prior to S/M, its\u00a0levels drop slowly during division, and it is completely eliminated in post-mitotic cells."

                        "text": "How might the abundance and turnover of CDKG1 mRNA and protein contribute to cell size control? A straightforward way of conceptualizing a sizer protein involves its synthesis in proportion to cell growth followed by triggering of a downstream cell cycle event when enough protein accumulated (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fantes et al., 1975</a>). The G1 cyclin CLN3 in budding yeast has been proposed to function in this manner with its abundance being sensed through occupancy of nuclear DNA binding sites (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). However, a mitotic 'sizer' in Chlamydomonas cannot simply trigger a single event, but must instead provide quantitative information so that mother cells execute the correct number of cell divisions. Cell division counting mechanisms exist in early embryonic cell cycles of some metazoans where a fixed number of rapid division cycles occurs prior to the midblastula transition that is triggered when the cytoplasmic to nuclear DNA ratio (N:C) reaches a specific value (<a href=\"#bib70\">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</a>). The ratio of CDKG1 to nuclear DNA changes dynamically during S/M as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, so a direct N:C sensing mechanism is possible. If a threshold amount of CDKG1 is required to initiate a new round of S/M, and the amount per nucleus decreases by over half with each division, then at some point the level of CDKG1 would fall below the critical amount. This model assumes that the main mode of reduction for CDKG1 is by dilution, but we also see some degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and possibly there is inactivation of a portion of CDKG1 with each round of S/M. Either of these latter two effects might account for larger mother cells needing proportionally more CDKG1 than smaller mother cells. For example a small mother cell undergoing one cycle of S/M might require <i>one</i> unit of CDKG1 (one division, two daughters); while a four-fold larger mother cell would require <i>seven</i> units of CDKG1 for executing a total of <i>seven</i> mitoses (1+2+4) to produce eight daughters. Alternatively, the allometric scaling of CDKG1 abundance might reflect a signal amplification process that increases the robustness of the system output (cell division number) by buffering what might otherwise be noisy fluctuations in CDKG1 levels (<a href=\"#bib18\">Di Talia et al., 2007</a>). Cell-size dependent effects on cell physiology are difficult to investigate, but do occur in other systems, such as yeast, where transcription can be size controlled (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wu et al., 2010</a>), and in animals, where bulk protein turnover rates appear to be cell-size dependent (<a href=\"#bib8\">Conlon et al., 2001</a>). Intriguingly, cell size is linked to developmental fate in the multicellular relative of Chlamydomonas, <i>Volvox carteri</i> where large post-mitotic daughters (&gt;8 \u00b5m diameter) differentiate into reproductive cells and small post-mitotic daughters (&lt;8 \u00b5m diameter) differentiate into sterile somatic cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kirk et al., 1993</a>). We speculate that this size-dependent differentiation may be driven by a modification of the CDKG1-D cyclin-MAT3/RBR pathway that is conserved in <i>Volvox</i> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Prochnik et al., 2010</a>). Finally, our data do not completely rule out more complicated and alternative models where other properties of CDKG1 besides its abundance, such as activation and inactivation by posttranslational modification or cyclin association, also contribute to its function in coupling mother cell size to cell division number."

In the former case a positive regulator is titrated away to control cell cycle exit, while in the latter it is a negative regulator being titrated away to control cell cycle entry; but in both models a fixed amount of a limiting factor is being used to gauge an important cellular change such as DNA content or cell volume. Non-linear scaling relationships between regulatory proteins and other cell constituents may be a general way of converting continuously scaling features of cells such as size to digital behaviors such as cell division that require an all or none response."

Similarly, overexpression of the human RB kinase CDK6 is associated with sporadic cases of lymphoma (<a href=\"#bib9\">Corcoran et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hayette et al., 2003</a>). Consistent with its role in regulating cell size and S/M phase entry upstream of MAT3/RBR, CDKG1 can directly phosphorylate RB/MAT3, and the simplest interpretation of our data is that the extent or rate of MAT3/RBR phosphorylation by CDKG1 on specific sites controls S/M phase entry. Although we could not detect changes in bulk phosphorylation patterns in MAT3/RBR caused by loss of CDKG1 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) this is not inconsistent with CDKG1 being a MAT3/ RBR kinase. Animal RBRs are phosphorylated on over a dozen sites by multiple CDK-cyclin complexes with site specificity, redundancy and function of individual phosphorylation sites still not completely understood (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rubin, 2013</a>). MAT3/RBR has 16 predicted CDK phosphorylation sites (<a href=\"#bib75\">Umen and Goodenough, 2001</a>), any one of which might be a substrate for one or more CDKs and phosphatases. Indeed, at least three CDKs are likely to be active during S/M\u2014CDKA1, CDKB1 and CDKG1 (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tulin and Cross, 2014</a>), with the first two having mRNAs that are expressed at several fold higher levels than that of <i>CDKG1</i> (<a href=\"#bib81\">Zones et al., 2015</a>). We predict that CDKG1 complexed with D-type cyclins will target a single or small subset of these sites to influence the activity of the MAT3/RBR complex towards promotion of cell division, an idea that can be tested when the phosphorylation sites and kinases for MAT3/RBR are better understood. While CDKG1 may have substrates other than MAT3/RBR, it appears to act mainly through MAT3/RBR in size control since the <i>cdkg1</i> mutation is completely suppressed in <i>cdkg1 mat3</i> double mutants. If there are additional CDKG1 substrates that influence the cell cycle, they either function through the MAT3/RBR-E2F1-DP1 complex or play a relatively minor role in size control."

Here we have identified <i>cdkg1</i> as a mutant that appears to affect only the S/M size control mechanism and not the size at which cells pass Commitment. Two lines of evidence support a specific role for CDKG1 in S/M size control. First, <i>cdkg1</i> mutants and <i>CDKG1</i> mis-expressing strains show daughter cell size phenotypes, but pass Commitment at close to wild-type size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Second, CDKG1 protein is produced in late G1 and S/M, and does not accumulate significantly at Commitment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, 4\u20136 hr). The identification of a separate S/M size control mechanism will enable future work aimed at dissecting the relationship between the Commitment and S/M sizers that both converge on the MAT3/RBR-E2F1-DP1 complex. It will also be interesting to determine how CDKG1 and the RB pathway connect to the NIMA related kinase, CNK2, that appears to function in both cell size and flagella length control (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bradley and Quarmby, 2005</a>)."

Our work with CDKG1 shows that unicellular eukaryotes also evolved complex cell cycle regulatory systems with multiple CDKs, and that this complexity was most likely lost in fungi rather than gained in metazoans. Moreover, the parallels between CDK4/6 and CDKG1 are striking: both are non-essential CDKs with variant PSTAIRE signature motifs; both bind specifically to and are activated by D-type cyclins; both phosphorylate RB-related proteins as their key substrates; and both are part of a system that integrates intra- or extra-cellular information (growth factors or cell size) into the cell cycle program (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>).

Coverslips were washed 3 x10\u2009min in 1% blocking solution I, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 20% blocking solution I) for 1\u00a0hr and then incubated with DAPI (5 \u00b5g/mL in H<sub>2</sub>O) for 5 min. Stained cells were washed in 1 x PBS for 3 x 3\u2009min and mounted with Mowiol 4\u201388 (Polysciences Inc,\u00a0) containing 0.01%\u00a0PPD (p-phenylenediamine). Z-stacks of fluorescence images were collected with a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope\u00a0(Zeiss,\u00a0Germany) equipped with a 488 nm argon laser (for Alex Fluor 488) and 405 nm UV laser (for DAPI). Quantification of HA-CDKG1 immunofluorescence intensity was done using ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abramoff et al., 2004</a>). For quantitation of IF signals cells identified first from DIC images and data from all cells in a field were collected. Identical numbers of Z stacks for each cell were collected with identical settings (using untagged control samples to determine background) and converted to maximum projection images that were imported into ImageJ for further analysis. Cell boundaries were defined manually using the DIC image. Nuclear area was defined by automated segmentation of the DAPI signal. The total nuclear HA-CDKG1 immunofluorescence intensity was calculated as the portion of the 488nm signal that overlapped with the DAPI stained region of the cell. The nuclear area (A) was converted to the nuclear volume (V) using a formula that approximates nuclei as spheres V=4/3*(A/\u03c0)<sup>3/2</sup>. Nuclear concentrations of HA-CDKG1 were calculated as nuclear HA-CDKG1 immunofluorescence intensity divided by nuclear volume (V). Cells where at least three divisions were predicted to occur based mother size were used in order to allow meaningful comparisons of CDKG1 concentrations at different division numbers. Mean values of nuclear concentration of HA-CDKG1 in daughter cells were compared between dividing cells at different stages (2, 4, or 8 nuclei) using a non-parametric two-tailed t test (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The ratio of HA-CDKG1 to nuclear DNA was calculated as total nuclear HA-CDKG1 immunofluorescence intensity summed over all nuclei within the mother cell divided by nuclei number within the same mother cell, considering one nucleus as one copy of total nuclear DNA."

Transformants were grown and re-screened on up to 200 \u00b5g/mL Zeocin followed by live cell fluorescence imaging to identify transformants with stable, bright nuclear GFP fluorescence. A <i>ble-GFP</i> strain with strong GFP signal was cultured in HSM medium at 25\u00b0C and synchronized under a 12\u2009hr light:12\u2009hr dark cycle with bubbling aeration of air and 0.5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Culture illumination was provided by a combination of red (625 nm) and blue (465 nm) LEDs each set for 150 \u00b5E for a total of 300 \u00b5E. Samples were collected during the peak of S/M phase between 12\u2009hr light and 1\u2009hr dark.

The kinase CDKG1, a divergent CDK, was identified from a screen for cell-size mutants. <i>cdkg1</i> mutants exhibit relatively normal growth through G1 and commitment, but fail to undergo the normal number of S/M cycles, resulting in larger than normal cells. CDKG1 can interact with RB and might be in a complex with CYCD3 and genetically, acts upstream of RB. The authors show that CDKG1 is required for execution of the normal number of reductional cell divisions that determine cell size, and, over-expression of CDKG1 causes reduced cell size. They propose a model by which CDKG levels act as a \"sizer\" and that dilution + degradation of CDKG sets a limit on the number of cell divisions once the concentration of CDKG is below a threshold, divisions stop."

We are aware that IF quantitation is potentially problematic and that care must be taken to eliminate subjective bias. For this reason we used a semi-automated method where all dividing cells were first identified and marked from a field of DIC images. IF data was collected from all of the pre-marked cells using an automated process of signal detection for the nucleus (DAPI channel) followed by quantitation of the overlapping CDKG1 signal. For this reason we are convinced that the reduction in CDKG1 IF signal in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> reflects a small but real reduction in its concentration as cells progress through each division. We also emphasize that the ratio of CDKG1 to nuclear DNA unambiguously drops by at least two-fold with each round of division and we argue that this ratio is likely to be the key parameter sensed in this system, though we acknowledge other possibilities as described in Point 4 below (paragraph three, Discussion)."

We disagree with the notion that what we observed for CDKG1 would have to be unique for it to be a useful gauge of mother cell size or regulator of division. It is completely conceivable that many proteins scale in abundance the same way as CDKG1, but CDKG1 was evolutionarily selected as a proxy to be used for division control. We also note that our bulk protein data from coomassie gels shows that most proteins do not scale the way CDKG1 does. However, as suggested by the reviewers, it was still worthwhile to examine the behavior of two other cell cycle regulated proteins, \u03b1-tubulin and histone H3. Transcripts of the former show cell cycle regulation with a peak around the time of division (Zones et al., 2015) while the histone transcripts and proteins were both previously measured and found to be cell cycle regulated (Waterborg et al., 1995). Our new quantitative Western blotting experiments in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> show that neither \u03b1 tubulin nor histone H3 scaled the same way as CDKG1 in mother cells of different sizes and in non-dividing controls (paragraph two, subsection \u201cCDKG1 production scales with mother-cell size\u201d)."

We were able to address the question of whether phosphorylation of RB is strongly impacted by loss of CDKG1 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and found that it is not. This result is not surprising given that CDKG1 is non-essential and its mRNA is never expressed at more than a fraction of the levels of the two major cell cycle kinases, CDKA and CDKB.
