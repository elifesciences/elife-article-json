Two molecular modules composed of Fat(Ft)/Dachsous(Ds)/Four-jointed(Fj) and a \u2018PCP-core\u2019 including Frizzled(Fz) and Dishevelled(Dsh) contribute to polarization of individual cells. How polarity is globally coordinated with tissue axes is unresolved. Consistent with previous results, we find that the Ft/Ds/Fj-module has an effect on a MT-cytoskeleton. Here, we provide evidence for the model that the Ft/Ds/Fj-module provides directional information to the core-module through this MT organizing function. We show Ft/Ds/Fj-dependent initial polarization of the apical MT-cytoskeleton prior to global alignment of the core-module, reveal that the anchoring of apical non-centrosomal MTs at apical junctions is polarized, observe that directional trafficking of vesicles containing Dsh depends on Ft, and demonstrate the feasibility of this model by mathematical simulation. Together, these results support the hypothesis that Ft/Ds/Fj provides a signal to orient core PCP function via MT polarization."

In the fly wing epithelium, three of the six proteins, Frizzled, Dishevelled and Diego (Dgo), become enriched at the distal adherens junctions (AJ), two, Van Gogh (Vang) and Prickle (Pk) localize to the proximal side, while Starry night/Flamingo (Fmi) localizes to both proximal and distal sides (<a href=\"#bib6\">Axelrod, 2009</a>).

We show that, in the developing wing, Ds and Fj signal through a PCP-specific domain of Ft, together with one or more partially redundant, additional signal(s), to polarize these apical MTs. Ft coordinates association of MTs with apical intercellular junctions, suggesting that Ft and Ds spatially regulate capture and organization of the apical MT cytoskeleton. We show that, in addition to Fz, vesicles containing Dsh are transcytosed on these MTs, and that transcytosis is disrupted in <i>ft</i> or <i>ds</i> mutant tissue, suggesting that this trafficking provides directional bias for core protein localization. Together, our results support the hypothesis that global polarity information is provided by the Ft/Ds/Fj module and other signals to orient the apical MT network, which in turn orients polarization of the core PCP module."

While foregoing the ability to determine plus-end orientation as provided by analysis of EB1 comets, this approach enables analysis of vastly greater numbers of MTs than does the EB1 assay, and also provides the potential to distinguish a more stable, anchored population, though in fact we see a strong correlation between results from both methods (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

We detect a similar relationship in pupal wings (<a href=\"#fig3s2 fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3</a>). The steepest regions of the gradients correspond to the most polarized MTs (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> to <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Therefore, Ds and Fj gradients are appropriately aligned to polarize the MT cytoskeleton and thereby bias core PCP protein polarization from its earliest appearance. These data are consistent with the temporal requirement for Ds in the larval stage (<a href=\"#bib27\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aigouy et al., 2010</a>)."

                                "text": "Note that caution is required in deciphering the Ds and Fj gradients. Existing data for Fj expression all derive from Fj-LacZ expression, and should therefore be considered only approximate at best. For Ds, low magnification images can be deceptive, since excess cytoplasmic signal, in contrast to the relevant membrane pool, cannot be distinguished, and because smaller cells give the appearance of higher concentrations in low magnification even if membrane intensity is constant. Therefore, we have focused on analyzing subcellular asymmetric localization of Ds in high magnification images, and examples of these data are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1 fig3s2 fig3s3 fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>. We observe that, for the most part, asymmetry of Ds localization is very similar to that of core protein localization."

In this region, Ds and Fmi polarities therefore appear to be less tightly coupled. While we do not know the reason for this, we can speculatively suggest several possibilities. These include (1) the tendency for the core system to promote local alignment producing a more parallel arrangement than would a direct readout of the Ds pattern; (2) that oppositely oriented Ft-Ds heterodimers are unevenly distributed despite the even distribution of total Ds; (3) the tendency of MTs to align along the long axis of the cell may be stronger than the influence of Ft-Ds. Consistent with this, MT orientation correlates more strongly with the long axis of cells than with the Ds asymmetry (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, box 5). Finally, (4) we cannot rule out the possibility that other unknown signals may also be acting on MT orientation (see \u2018An independent directional signal in the wing periphery?\u2019)."

                                "text": "It has been suggested that PCP defects in <i>ds</i> and <i>ft</i> mutants may be due to activation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, which is also controlled by Ft/Ds/Fj, because <i>ft</i> mutant larval wing discs with rescued Hippo signaling show only weak PCP defects limited to the most proximal part of the wing despite the clonal PCP phenotypes observed in pupal and adult wings (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>). To better assess whether the Ft/Ds/Fj pathway modulates the MT cytoskeleton independent of Hippo signaling, and to do so across the expanse of the wing, we analyzed <i>ft</i><sup>null</sup> mutant flies rescued with Ft\u0394ECD\u0394N-1, a truncated form of Ft lacking a PCP signaling domain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</a>). These flies are deficient for PCP signaling, but competent for Hippo pathway regulation. They showed PCP defects in the proximal-central part of the adult wing, displaying swirling patterns reminiscent of those in <i>ft</i> clones (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ma et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</a>). At 24 hAPF, MTs in the proximal and central part of the wing, where hair polarity is often disturbed, were randomized (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,A\u2032</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5A,A\u2032</a>). In contrast, the peripheral and distal regions of these wings had more coherent hair polarity, with hairs pointing more toward the wing margin than in wildtype wings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), mirroring the orientation of core PCP protein domains (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5A,A\u2033</a>). In these peripheral regions, MTs were ordered and oriented with the hairs and core PCP domains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2033</a>). Flies in which the Ds and Fj gradients were removed showed an essentially identical phenotype (<i>ds</i><sup><i>38k</i></sup> <i>fj</i><sup><i>N7</i></sup><i>/ds</i><sup><i>UA071</i></sup> <i>fj</i><sup><i>d1</i></sup><i>; UAS-Ds/TubP-Gal4;</i> <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5B\u2013B\u2033</a>). Finally, MT orientation was randomized in <i>ft</i> or <i>ds</i> clones in the same proximal part of the wing where it is disturbed in <i>ft</i> mutant wings rescued for Hippo signaling (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5C</a>; see also [<a href=\"#bib24\">Ma et al., 2008</a>]). These data show that in the central part of pupal wings, MT orientation, core PCP protein polarity and adult polarity are strongly dependent on PCP signaling through Ft (<a href=\"#fig3s5 fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 5 and 6</a>). They also suggest the existence of an additional signal, perhaps from the wing margin, that can orient MTs in the periphery of the wing."

In cells surrounding <i>ft</i> clones in wing discs, where unopposed Ds within the clone is expected to recruit excess Ft to the neighboring cell boundaries, nascent MT bundles are inappropriately polarized toward the cell border abutting the mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,B\u2032</a>). Similarly, in pupal wings MTs are perpendicular to the clone boundary (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,C\u2033</a>), consistent with the reported non-autonomy resulting from manipulating the Ft/Ds/Fj system (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>). To quantify this result, we applied our image analysis tool to cells bordering (n = 51) <i>ft</i> clones in regions where MTs would otherwise be expected to run parallel to the clone border. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2033</a> shows that in these cells, MTs are reorganized predominantly perpendicular to the clone border. These results are consistent with the reported reversal of MT orientation in wings with an ectopic Ds gradient, although this was only examined late in the polarization process, during pupal development (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harumoto et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, Ft and Ds are both required and instructive for MT organization."

Since we have proposed that Dsh is the critical determinant that must be asymmetrically localized (<a href=\"#bib4\">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Axelrod, 2009</a>), we also examined Dsh::GFP vesicle movement in developing wings in the AJ plane, between 15 and 32 hr after puparium formation (hAPF). The majority of vesicles (80%, <i>n</i> = 1192) moved along the P/D axis, and showed a significant though modest bias towards distal vs proximal transport (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Dsh::GFP vesicles exhibited two distinct patterns of trafficking. First, and most commonly, vesicles emerged from one side of the cell and were transported directly across the length of the cell to be incorporated into the membrane of an opposing cellular face (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Movement was highly linear and processive, though occasional backtracking and zig-zagging was observed. Often, multiple vesicles followed similar paths in a given cell, with vesicle scission and fusion appearing to occur repeatedly at specific sites. Second, a minority of Dsh::GFP vesicles took staggered paths without directional bias, paused frequently, and often left the apical plane of the cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,B\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The former pattern likely reflects polarized transcytosis, resulting in net transport of Dsh to the distal membrane, while the latter reflects a recycling pathway. Consistently, in fixed specimens, only a minor fraction of Dsh vesicles co-stains with the early endosome marker Rab5 or exocyst protein Sec5 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, a minority of vesicles moves through the recycling pathway while the majority of Dsh vesicles appears to be part of a transcytosis pathway. In contrast, we see no directionally biased trafficking of Vang::YFP vesicles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Note that biased directional transport of any one component of the core PCP proteins should be sufficient to provide an input bias; bulk transport to achieve the remainder of asymmetric localization is expected to occur by diffusion in combination with feedback at intercellular junctions. Together with prior data, our observations suggest that the \u2018distal\u2019 components Fz and Dsh, but not \u2018proximal\u2019 components, are subject to directional trafficking."

Furthermore, the repeated scission of vesicles from specific regions suggests that vesicle formation may be coupled to the locations of MT-associated junctional structures observed in EM images. Furthermore, the common directionality of these temporally clustered vesicular trafficking events suggests that individual MTs nucleated at or associated with a given junctional density, are likely to have the same polarity. Though the hypothesis that biased trafficking of Dsh and Fz depends on polarized MTs that are organized by Ft/Ds/Fj is appealing (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harumoto et al., 2010</a>), no data directly link Ft/Ds/Fj function to directed vesicle trafficking. To test this, we examined Dsh::GFP vesicle movement in proximal <i>ft</i> mutant pupal wing tissue. We observed that, in comparison to wildtype cells, vesicles moved much shorter distances (or showed no net movement), without directional bias, and lacked processivity, instead taking random paths with frequent direction changes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

We found that, unlike in <i>ft</i> mutant cells, most Dsh<sup>1</sup>::GFP vesicles move along the P-D axis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), consistent with the presence of oriented MTs, and indicating that oriented trafficking does not depend on core protein asymmetry. We observed that Dsh<sup>1</sup>::GFP vesicles frequently fail to fuse with membranes, and compared to wildtype, more frequently disappear from the apical plane or do not exhibit overall net movement, perhaps reflecting defects specific to the Dsh<sup>1</sup> allele. These results show that apical planar MTs that direct biased transcytosis of Dsh depend on the Ft/Ds/Fj pathway, but not on core module function. Furthermore, the movement of Dsh<sup>1</sup> vesicles, the faster kinetics of transcytosing Dsh vesicles, and the greater processivity, compared to Fz vesicles all suggest that Dsh and Fz vesicles may be at least partially distinct populations."

Given the apparent variation in asymmetry of Ft-Ds dimers at different times and places in wing development, we wished to assess the potential consequences of this variation on core PCP protein asymmetry. We therefore simulated this mechanism by adapting our previously described mathematical model for PCP signaling (<a href=\"#bib4\">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ma et al., 2008</a>). The modified model establishes a MT network with polarity determined by the relative concentrations of Ft on any side of a cell. User-defined input gradients of Ds and Fj determine Ft concentrations in a manner consistent with the experimentally defined model. Dsh is then transported toward the plus ends of MTs, while still permitting bulk movement of all components by diffusion (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We first validated the model by correctly reproducing the domineering non-autonomy (or lack thereof) surrounding clones of core PCP mutants (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, we confirmed that the model correctly simulates the ability of the core module to propagate polarization across small <i>ft</i> mutant clones (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As discussed above, there is considerable ambiguity about the shape of the Ds gradient through wing development, but to a first approximation, it appears to undergo considerable change from larval wing discs, where there is a comparatively linear gradient, at least in the distal portion of the wing not hidden by tissue folds, to one with a steep drop and very shallow or flat portion in the 24\u201330 hr pupal wing (<a href=\"#fig3s1 fig3s2 fig3s3 fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ma et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hogan et al., 2011</a>). In third instar discs, gradients of Ds and Fj are roughly linear (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In simulation, oppositely oriented linear gradients of Ds and Fj polarize a field of cells with similar kinetics and identical steady state levels of polarization across the entire field. Whereas in the larval wing disc, the Ds gradient may be gradual, in the pupal wing, the gradient of Ds approaches a step gradient as it rearranges first to a projection of high Ds in the central part of the pupal wing, and later to a very high proximal concentrations and a shallow or even flat distal distribution. Notably, simulation of a linear gradient, a step gradient, or a steep proximal Ds gradient and a shallow or flat distal gradient produces identical levels of steady state polarization across the field and similar proximal and distal kinetics, showing that the mechanism is not expected to be very sensitive to the precise shape of the Ds gradient (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In the cases of a steep local Ds gradient, propagation of Ft-Ds polarity into an adjacent shallow or flat region is weak, and limited to two columns of cells (data not shown), most likely due to absence of a robust feedback mechanism in our model. Similarly, propagation of Ft-Ds polarization in vivo is seen to be much weaker than that of the core PCP mechanism (c.f. <a href=\"#bib3\">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, propagation of polarity through the shallow or flat region is primarily due to polarization and propagation of the core PCP system."

We therefore simulated several additional conditions. First, we simulated a steep proximal gradient with a distal zero level of Ds that produces randomized distal MT orientation in our model. Global directional input is therefore restricted to the proximal region. In this case, we see equivalent proximal and distal steady state polarization, but with a substantial delay in reaching steady state in the distal region, reflecting time needed to propagate polarity from proximal to distal through the core mechanism. To simulate MTs that are P-D oriented, but without a measurable plus-end bias, as are observed in pupal wings, we enforced this MT architecture in the distal wing, with a steep proximal Ds gradient. Simulation of this condition predicts modestly faster core PCP polarization compared to random distal MTs, but not to change steady state core PCP polarization. Therefore, the observed unbiased but oriented MTs in the distal wing might facilitate more rapid core PCP polarization and also maintenance of polarity in the face of perturbations."

We propose that in third instar wings, when the tissue is smaller, the two signals are largely redundant, so that defects in Hippo-rescued <i>ft</i> mutants are limited to the most proximal regions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Feng and Irvine, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pan et al., 2013</a>), whereas in larger pupal and adult wings, Hippo-rescued <i>ft</i> mutants show larger regions of disturbed polarity.

Pupae were mounted on a small piece of double-sided tape and forceps were used to dissect open a small window in their pupal cases to provide visual access to the live pupal wing. Approximately 50 \u03bcl of halocarbon oil was placed over each dissected pupa to allow its release from the tape, following which the pupae were mounted on a VivaScience petriPERM 50 hydrophobic membrane disk in halocarbon oil between pieces of hydrated Whatman paper for in vivo confocal fluorescence microscopy. Videos showing Dsh::GFP and membrane RFP (used to mark wildtype cells) show that internalized Dsh::GFP is always seen to co-stain with RFP. Furthermore, Shimada et al. reported that in fixed images the majority of Dsh and Fz vesicles overlap (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shimada et al., 2006</a>). We are therefore confident that internalized Dsh::GFP is in vesicles."

We conclude that differences in the profile have no effect on steady state, and in most cases only subtle effects on the kinetics.

It is indeed correct that some ft clones, primarily larger ones, or those that traverse regions with more irregular cell geometry, such as veins, are more likely to produce swirling hair polarity patterns. This was analyzed previously in Ma et al PNAS 2008. In these cases, Fmi and other core proteins are mislocalized in concordance with the hair polarity pattern. The reviewer wonders why MTs might be oriented differently from the core protein pattern at clone boundaries. Perhaps the simplest case is the one in which a modest sized ft clone does not alter core protein or hair polarity. Here, MTs are still misoriented next to the clone (at A-P oriented edges). To explain this, one must keep in mind that while our hypothesis is that the polarity of a cell is biased by the orientation of MTs, a stronger influence is the tendency of core function to locally align polarity between cells (see <a href=\"#bib25\">Ma et al 2003</a> for discussion of this phenomenon). To minimize discontinuities in local polarity, this influence will override the influence of the global Ft dependent signal via MTs. A system with this design will produce highly coordinated polarity even in the presence of an imprecise global signal resulting from imprecise gradients, as must necessarily be generated over such a long range."

To address all of these concerns, we have added some explanation to the text, and pointed out the important take home message, which is that the true steepness of the gradient of membrane associated Ds is ambiguous and might change over time.
