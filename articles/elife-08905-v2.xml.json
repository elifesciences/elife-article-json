Yet insight into their mechanism of action may point to novel opportunities to target Ras. Here, we show that several cancer-associated mutations in the switch III region moderately increase Ras activity in all isoforms. Mutants are biochemically inconspicuous, while their clustering into nanoscale signaling complexes on the plasma membrane, termed nanocluster, is augmented. Nanoclustering dictates downstream effector recruitment, MAPK-activity, and tumorigenic cell proliferation. Our results describe an unprecedented mechanism of signaling protein activation in cancer."

Yet insight into their mechanism of action may point to novel opportunities to target Ras. Here, we show that several cancer-associated mutations in the switch III region moderately increase Ras activity in all isoforms. Mutants are biochemically inconspicuous, while their clustering into nanoscale signaling complexes on the plasma membrane, termed nanocluster, is augmented. Nanoclustering dictates downstream effector recruitment, MAPK-activity, and tumorigenic cell proliferation. Our results describe an unprecedented mechanism of signaling protein activation in cancer."

These oncogenic lesions render Ras transforming and tumorigenic, as they leave Ras constitutively GTP bound and therefore ready to overdrive in particular the Ras/MAPK pathway, which critically controls cell division and other oncogenic processes. A different mutational spectrum is found in RASopathies, developmental syndromes that are characterized by facio-cutaneous malformations, heart developmental and neurodevelopmental defects, as well as a predisposition to certain cancers (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schubbert et al., 2007</a>). These syndromes are also characterized by a hyperactivation of the Ras/MAPK-signaling pathway. For example, in Noonan syndrome, <i>NRAS</i> or <i>KRAS</i> can be mutated at various positions along their coding sequences in the germline. The exact molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the observed phenotypes are still largely unclear (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prior et al., 2012</a>). For non hot-spot mutations in Ras that coincide with the known nucleotide binding regions, the G1\u2013G5 boxes, mechanistic explanations for aberrant activities have been demonstrated or proposed (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schubbert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gremer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Prior et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cirstea et al., 2013</a>).

Instead, a strict correlation between increased recruitment of the effector to Ras and augmented nanoclustering of Ras on cellular membranes is found.

Assuming that the G48R,D92N mutations were gain of function, we combined these cancer-associated mutations with the inactivating mutation R128A,R135A on helix \u03b14. This new mutant showed normalized H-ras activity (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), comparable to the modeling-derived orientation-switch III mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This suggested that the cancer-associated mutation is also coupled to the reorientation mechanism of membrane bound H-ras and may thus also impact on its nanoclustering. Indeed, electron microscopic analysis of plasma membrane sheets derived from BHK cells expressing the single or double-mutant revealed a strong and significant increase in nanoclustering of both mutants as compared to the parent H-rasG12V (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This was confirmed by nanoclustering-FRET analysis in cells, where consistent with the increased Gal-1 complexation of the G48R-mutant (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the Gal-1-dose-dependent nanoclustering response was significantly increased for both the G48R and G48R,D92N mutants at all Gal-1 levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Moreover, the Gal-1-dose-dependent RBD recruitment response of both mutants was increased in cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), while RBD-binding in vitro remained indistinguishable from the parent Ras (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The correlation of the RBD- and nanoclustering-response pattern again suggested that augmented nanoclustering increased H-ras activity by enhancing effector recruitment. Together with the absence of any RBD-binding defect, this led us to the conclusion that introduction of mutations G48R or G48R,D92N enhances effector recruitment due to increased nanoclustering."

We therefore in the following concentrated on these isoforms to investigate the direct involvement of switch III mutations in tumor growth. In N-ras, the T50I mutation was found in a malignant melanoma and was recently also described to be associated with Noonan syndrome (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cirstea et al., 2010</a>), a RASopathy. The additional two mutations, C51Y and E49K, were found in hematologic and skin malignancies, respectively.

Their data suggest at least two conformational states, with the GTP-state displaying an occluded effector-binding site. Conversely, in the GDP-state the G-domain contacts the membrane via helix \u03b14 and \u03b15 thus exposing the effector interaction site. Also for N-ras low-resolution spectroscopic data support a nucleotide-dependent conformational change on the membrane (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kapoor et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2012b</a>). Importantly, the K-ras conformational reorientation resembles the one that is here assumed for H-ras. Interestingly, an inverse role of helix \u03b14 in stabilizing GDP- and GTP-conformations of H- and K-ras is implied, which matches to experimental data that we have provided earlier (<a href=\"#bib5\">Abankwa et al., 2010</a>).

Interestingly, the more stable \u03b2-dimer, which interfaces basically via the effector lobe of Ras, could prevent effector access. Similarly, coarse grain simulations of the clustering behavior of membrane-bound H-ras in two different conformations (basically corresponding to those in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) revealed that depending on the conformational state, preferred interfaces of the Ras proteins could be utilized (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li and Gorfe, 2013</a>)."

However, the mechanistic basis of how Ras activation is propagated is further complicated by the fact that we still lack detailed structural insight into for example, the precise activation of effectors, such as Raf. Ras-GTP nanoclusters are immobile, suggesting that a transient signaling machinery is built up, which is also coupled or trapped by the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kusumi et al., 2012</a>). The (isoform- or mutation-) specific GTP-Ras conformational states on the membrane may differentially engage Raf-isoforms thus allosterically enabling specific Ras-Raf-isoform coupling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Abankwa et al., 2010</a>). Here, the Ras-isoform-specific (acidic) membrane environment needs to be considered, as it is significant to retain clustered Raf (<a href=\"#bib41\">Plowman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cho et al., 2012</a>). Nanocluster formation can in addition be facilitated by nanocluster scaffolds, such as Gal-1. Gal-1 is typically dimeric suggesting that in nanoclusters, dimeric Ras\u2013Raf units may exist. Of note, the lipid anchors of Ras alone are sufficient to drive higher order clustering of both Ras and Raf (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nan et al., 2013</a>)."

Therefore, dimeric signaling units may be both the outcome, as well as the driver of multimeric nanocluster formation. This nanoclustering promoting activity of Raf-inhibitors might underlie the paradoxical hyperactivation of Ras signaling in Ras mutant tumors. Intriguingly, these Raf inhibitors act Ras isoform specifically on K- and N-ras-nanoclustering, suggesting that additional factors break the promiscuity of \u2018dimer inducers\u2019. Given that membrane anchored (nanoclustered) Raf is constitutively active (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nan et al., 2013</a>), facilitation of this effector clustering process is critical for downstream signaling output."

First of all, next to mutations in Ras that we have just described, one would have to take mutations and expression changes in largely unknown nanocluster scaffolds into account. Secondly, based on our data Ras activity is typically up-tuned 2\u20133 fold by nanoclustering (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guzm\u00e1n et al., 2014b</a>). By contrast, GEF activation switches Ras on in an \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 fashion (and GAPs off in the same manner), changing the enzymatic activity of Ras by 100 or even &gt;50,000-fold (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eccleston et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ford et al., 2006</a>). This would approximate the relative difference in Ras activity induced by hot-spot mutations and is much higher than activity changes by switch III-nanocluster mutations. Correspondingly, one could expect that this relation be to some extent reflected in the relative abundance (\u223c1/2300) of switch III mutations in cancer. Currently it is unclear, whether there is a particular relevance for switch III mutations in certain cancer types, as the frequencies are too low for any conclusive statement. Likewise, it is unclear whether these mutations represent remnants of early mutational events in tumors or stem from certain niches of it. Given the large activity difference, it is obvious that switch III mutated clones would easily be outcompeted by Ras hot-spot-mutated clones in a tumor. These features combined with the fact that switch III mutations may be associated with conformational changes in Ras that alter effector engagement, suggest that these mutations belong to the recently proposed class of \u2018latent driver\u2019 mutations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nussinov and Tsai, 2015</a>). Latent drivers are non-hotspot, lower frequency mutations, which appear like passenger mutations in that they do not cause malignancy.

For the sample excitation sinusoidally modulated 3 W, 497 nm LED at 40 MHz under epi-illumination was used. Cells were imaged using the 63\u00d7, NA 1.4 oil objective with the GFP filter set (excitation: BP 470/40, beam splitter: FT 495, emission: BP 525/50). The phase and modulation were determined using the manufacturer's software from images acquired at 12 phase settings. Fluorescein at 0.01 mM, pH 9 was used as a lifetime reference standard. Per condition, the fluorescence lifetime was measured typically for &gt;40 cells from three biological repeats. From the obtained fluorescence lifetimes the apparent FRET efficiency was calculated as described in <a href=\"#bib18\">Guzm\u00e1n et al. (2014b)</a>."

Area percentage was calculated using the ImageJ built-in function \u2018Analyze Particles\u2019 with exclusion of particles smaller than 500 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> that are not considered colonies. Statistical differences were determined by two-way ANOVA test."

The alternative conformations have different access to effectors, hence affecting signaling even by GTPase-defective RasG12V. They previously proposed that guanine nucleotides regulate the orientation in the membrane through a conformation switch in \u03b22-3 and \u03b15 (\u201cswitch 3\u201d), which is then relayed to \u03b14 and HVR. Here they test that proposal by combining activating (D47A, E49A) and inactivating (R161A) switch 3 mutations with \u03b14 and HVR mutations. Their results agree with their predictions. They also measured nanoclustering using EM and FRET approaches. They found that the activating mutations in switch 3 augment nanoclustering and RafRBD recruitment by RasG12V, and signaling is further stimulated by expressing galectin-1, which they showed before further augments nanoclustering. Increased RBD recruitment was not due to an increase in affinity of the purified Ras, but was only detected when membrane was present. However, it isn't clear how much of the increase in signaling is due to increased nanoclustering and how much is due to additional stabilization of the more accessible conformation."

These inferences were recently borne out by the KRas4B.GDP and GMPPNP NMR structures that were recently published in PNAS, showing that the effector domain of Ras.GTP is partially occluded when bound to a model membrane (May 26 2015 issue, Mohammad T. Mazhab-Jafari, 6625-6630, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1419895112\">doi:10.1073/pnas.1419895112</a>). It isn't clear how these NMR structures compare with the models proposed by Abankwa and colleagues. The Mazhab-Jafari paper also tested the effects of RASopathy (Noonan) mutations 5N and D153V on effector binding, and found that the mutations slightly increased the affinity of membrane-associated Ras for effectors but had no effect on free Ras. They proposed that decreased autoinhibition may account for the increased activity of these mutants. Mazhab-Jafari et al. did not address nanoclustering and did not test the same RASopathy mutations as have now been tested in the paper under review. Nevertheless, the new Mazhab-Jafari paper will lessen the impact of the present paper. New concepts have not been revealed."

The scope is to examine mutations that are predicted by earlier modeling and that exist naturally in tumors using electron microscopy and FRET to assess clustering and effector recruitment. Some analysis of signaling and transformation is also performed. Reading the paper is difficult because there is an ambiguity associated with discussing the conformers and if these are independent of the GTP/GDP state they need a clear definition for each, like A and B, etc. They refer to \u201cconformer\u201d in several places without specifying which conformer they are referring to, or as if there is a non-conformer or conformer state. They general fix the major which in the on position using the G12V mutant and then determine if mutations modulate self-FRET or RBD interactions. To me, these tools allow evaluation of clustering and RBD binding, but don't say much about conformation, which seems like a model to explain the findings, but they can otherwise make no strong conclusions. Another general comment is that they start with a strong emphasis on modeling based predictions, but then analyze several natural mutations with no prediction or reference back to the modeling to evaluate the negative and positive results obtained. In fact, they fail to provide any further comment when natural mutations in these regions have no effects on clustering or RBD binding. While the point is clearly to support the conformational switch III determinant in control of activity through nanoclustering, the analysis of the naturally existing mutations is not really pulled together to support this model."
