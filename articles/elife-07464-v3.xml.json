Uncertainty surrounding this process limits our ability to address inherited mtDNA diseases. We produce a new, physically motivated, generalisable theoretical model for mtDNA populations during development, allowing the first statistical comparison of proposed bottleneck mechanisms. Using approximate Bayesian computation and mouse data, we find most statistical support for a combination of binomial partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random mtDNA turnover, meaning that the debated exact magnitude of mtDNA copy number depletion is flexible. New experimental measurements from a wild-derived mtDNA pairing in mice confirm the theoretical predictions of this model. We analytically solve a mathematical description of this mechanism, computing probabilities of mtDNA disease onset, efficacy of clinical sampling strategies, and effects of potential dynamic interventions, thus developing a quantitative and experimentally-supported stochastic theory of the bottleneck."

Uncertainty surrounding this process limits our ability to address inherited mtDNA diseases. We produce a new, physically motivated, generalisable theoretical model for mtDNA populations during development, allowing the first statistical comparison of proposed bottleneck mechanisms. Using approximate Bayesian computation and mouse data, we find most statistical support for a combination of binomial partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random mtDNA turnover, meaning that the debated exact magnitude of mtDNA copy number depletion is flexible. New experimental measurements from a wild-derived mtDNA pairing in mice confirm the theoretical predictions of this model. We analytically solve a mathematical description of this mechanism, computing probabilities of mtDNA disease onset, efficacy of clinical sampling strategies, and effects of potential dynamic interventions, thus developing a quantitative and experimentally-supported stochastic theory of the bottleneck."

Immediately after fertilisation, a single oocyte (which may contain &gt;10<sup>5</sup> individual mtDNAs) may have a nonzero mtDNA mutant load or <i>heteroplasmy</i> (the proportion of mutant mtDNA in the cell). As the number of cells in the developing organism increases, the intercellular population then acquires an associated <i>heteroplasmy variance</i>, that is, the variance in mutant load across the population of cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), allowing removal of cells with high heteroplasmy and retention of cells with low heteroplasmy. Intense and sustained debate exists as to the mechanism by which this increase of heteroplasmy variance occurs. Several experimental results in mice suggest that, during development, the copy number of mtDNA per cell in the germ cell line drops dramatically to \u223c10<sup>2</sup>, reducing the effective population size of mitochondrial genomes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cree et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wai et al., 2008</a>). One postulated bottlenecking mechanism is that this low population size accelerates genetic drift and so increases the cell-to-cell heteroplasmy variance (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bergstrom and Pritchard, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aiken et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cree et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wonnapinij et al., 2010</a>), which was first observed to generally increase from primordial germ cells through primary oocytes to mature oocytes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jenuth et al., 1996</a>). However, independent experimental evidence (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wai et al., 2008</a>) suggests that heteroplasmy variance increases negligibly during this copy number reduction, though this interpretation has been debated (<a href=\"#bib57\">Samuels et al., 2010</a>). <a href=\"#bib67\">Wai et al. (2008)</a> shows heteroplasmy variance rising during folliculogenesis, after the mtDNA copy number minimum has been passed. In yet another picture, supported by conflicting experimental results (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cao et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2009</a>), heteroplasmy variance increases with a less pronounced decrease in mtDNA copy number (a minimum copy number &gt;10<sup>3</sup> in mice), solely through random effects associated with partitioning at cell divisions. Clearly a consensus on this important mechanism is yet to be reached."

While previous simulation work (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cree et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Poovathingal et al., 2009</a>) has taken such a philosophy with specific model assumptions, we are not aware of such a study allowing for the wide variety of replication and partitioning dynamics proposed in the literature; we further note that replication-degradation-partitioning mtDNA models are yet to be fully described analytically. Nor is there a general quantitative framework under which different proposed bottleneck mechanisms can be statistically compared given extant data (although statistical analyses focusing on particular mechanisms and individual sets of experimental results have been used throughout the literature, for example, using a Bayesian approach under a particular bottleneck model to infer model bottleneck size [<a href=\"#bib42\">Marchington et al., 1998</a>]).

Subsequently, we confirm the predictions of this model by performing new experimental measurements of heteroplasmy statistics in mice with an mtDNA admixture, including a wild-derived haplotype, that is genetically distinct from previous studies. We then analytically solve the equations describing mtDNA population dynamics under this mechanism and show that these results allow us to investigate potential interventions to modulate the bottleneck (suggesting that upregulation of mtDNA degradation may increase the power of the bottleneck to avoid inherited disease; we discuss potential strategies for such an intervention) and yield quantitative results for clinical questions including the timescales and probabilities of disease onset, and the efficacy of strategies to sample heteroplasmy in clinical planning."

The Cree mechanism involves random replication and degradation of mtDNAs throughout development, and binomial partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions. The Cao mechanism involves partitioning of clusters of mtDNA at each cell division, thus providing strong stochastic effects associated with each division. We consider a general set of dynamics through which this cluster inheritance may be manifest, including the possibility of heteroplasmic \u2018nucleoids\u2019 of constant internal structure (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jacobs et al., 2000</a>), sets of molecules or nucleoids within an organelle, homoplasmic clusters, and different possible cluster sizes (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). The Wai mechanism involves the replication of a subset of mtDNAs during folliculogenesis. We note that this latter mechanism can be manifest in several ways: (a) through slow random replication of mtDNAs (so that, in any given time window, only a subset of mtDNAs will be actively replicating) or (b) through the restriction of replication to a specific subset of mtDNAs at some point during development. We will refer to these different manifestations as Wai (a) and Wai (b) respectively. The Wai (a) mechanism and the Cree model can both be addressed in the same mechanistic framework (with potentially different parameterisations): if the rate of random replication in the Cree model is sufficiently low during folliculogenesis, only a subset of mtDNAs will be actively replicating at any given time during this period, thus recapitulating the Wai (a) mechanism (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>).

A parameter <i>S</i> determines whether these processes are deterministic (specific rates of proliferation) or stochastic (replication and degradation of each mtDNA is a random event).

In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> we show posterior probabilities on each of these mechanisms. These posterior probabilities give the inferred statistical support for each mechanism, derived from model selection performed with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beaumont et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Toni et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sunn\u00e5ker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Johnston, 2014</a>) using uniform priors. ABC involves choosing a threshold value dictating how close a fit to experimental data is required to accept a particular model parameterisation as reasonable. In our case, this goodness-of-fit is computed using a comparison of squared residuals associated with the trajectories of mean mtDNA copy number and normalised heteroplasmy variance (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). Each of the experimental measurements corresponds to a sample variance, derived from a finite number of samples of an underlying distribution of heteroplasmies, and therefore has an associated uncertainty and sampling error (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wonnapinij et al., 2010</a>). The reasonably small sample sizes used in these sample variance measurements are likely to underestimate the underlying heteroplasmy variance (the target of our inference). Our ABC approach naturally addresses these uncertainties by using summary statistics derived from sampling a set of stochastic incarnations of a given model, where the size of this set is equal to the number of measurements contributing to the experimentally-determined statistic (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> clearly shows that as the ABC threshold is decreased, requiring closer agreement between the distributions of simulated and experimental data, the posterior probability of the BDP model increases, to dramatically exceed those of the other models. This increase indicates that the BDP model is the most statistically supported, and capable of providing the best explanation of experimental data (which can be inutitively seen from the trajectories in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We note that ABC model selection automatically takes model complexity into account, and conclude that the BDP mechanism is the best supported proposed mechanism for the bottleneck. Briefly, this result arises because the BDP model produces increasing variance both due to early cell division stochasticity <i>and</i> later random turnover. By contrast, the Cao model alone only increases variance in early development when cell divisions are occurring. Qualitatively, this behaviour through time holds regardless of cluster (nucleoid) size and regardless of whether clusters are heteroplasmic or homoplasmic (allowing heteroplasmic clusters decreases the magnitude of heteroplasmy variance but not its behaviour through time, see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). The Wai (b) model alone similarly only increases variance at a single time point (later, during folliculogenesis)."

These observations thus correspond to results expected from the random turnover from the BDP model. We also note the mathematical observation that the Wai (b) mechanism requires the replication of &lt;1% of mtDNAs during folliculogenesis to yield reasonable heteroplasmy variance increases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows the optimal case with <i>\u03b1</i> = 0.006; optimal fits to data generally show 0.005 &lt; <i>\u03b1</i> &lt; 0.01), and the proportions of loci visible in <a href=\"#bib67\">Wai et al.

This similarity holds broadly, regardless of whether the internal structure of clusters is constant across cell divisions or allowed to mix between divisions. The BDP model, in addition to describing the partitioning of individual mtDNAs, also thus represents the statistics of mtDNA populations in which heteroplasmic nucleoids are inherited (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jacobs et al., 2000</a>), or individual organelles containing a mixed set of mtDNAs or nucleoids are inherited, regardless of the size of these nucleoids (see \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

We first explore the effects of modulating mtDNA turnover by varying <i>\u03bb</i> and <i>\u03bd</i> in concert, corresponding to an increase in mtDNA degradation balanced by a corresponding increase in mtDNA replication. This increased mtDNA turnover increases the heteroplasmy variance (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) due to the increased variability in mtDNA copy number from the underlying random processes occurring at increased rates. We find that increasing mtDNA degradation <i>\u03bd</i> without increasing <i>\u03bb</i> also increases heteroplasmy variance, in addition to decreasing the overall mtDNA copy number (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Applying this unbalanced increase in mtDNA degradation without a matching change in replication has a strong effect on mtDNA dynamics as it corresponds to a universal change in the \u2018control\u2019 applied to the system, analogous, for example, to changing target copy numbers in manifestations of relaxed replication (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chinnery and Samuels, 1999</a>). The simple model we use does not include feedback, and controls mtDNA dynamics solely through kinetic parameters. Perturbing the balance of these parameters thus strongly affects the expected behaviour of the system. As we discuss later, elucidation of the specific mechanisms by which control is manifest in mtDNA populations will require further research, but these numerical experiments attempt to represent the cases where a perturbation is naturally compensated for (matched changes, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and where it is not (unbalanced change, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

An increase in mtDNA degradation is expected to either directly increase heteroplasmy variance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) if mtDNA populations are weakly controlled, or to provoke a compensatory, population-maintaining increase in mtDNA replication, thus increasing mtDNA turnover, which also acts to increase variance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) if mtDNA populations are subject to feedback control. The increase in variance through either of these pathways will increase the power of cell-level selection to remove cells with high heteroplasmy and thus purify the population. For this reason, we speculate that mitochondrial degradation may represent a potential clinical target to address the inheritance of mtDNA disease (more detail in <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>)."

The probability of obtaining a given heteroplasmy can therefore be computed as a sum over all copy number states that correspond to that heteroplasmy.

This approximation involves fixation probabilities for each mtDNA type and a truncated Normal distribution for intermediate heteroplasmies (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a> we show that this approximation corresponds well to the exact distributions calculated using the hypergeometric function.

We can use our modelling framework and Bayes' theorem (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) to obtain a formula for this conditional probability, allowing a rigorous probability to be assigned to inferences from preimplantation sampling. Here, as above, we employ the truncated Normal approximation for the heteroplasmy distribution, noting that the exact treatment using hypergeometric functions is straightforward but more computationally expensive. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> illustrates this process by showing the probability distributions on embryonic heteroplasmy when measurements <i>h</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> = 0.1 or 0.4 have been taken at different times during development. The increasing heteroplasmy variance through development means that substantially greater uncertainty is associated with heteroplasmy values inferred using measurements taken at later times. In conclusion, although care must be taken in applying this reasoning to cell types in which, for example, mitochondrial and cell turnover rates differ from those assumed here, or differentiation leads to tissue-specific selective factors acting on the mtDNA population, this formalism provides a general means of rigorously inferring embryonic heteroplasmy through genetic diagnosis sampling."

We emphasise that the bottom-up construction of our model from physical first principles both increases the flexibility and generality of our model, allowing different mechanisms to be compared together, and providing information on mtDNA dynamics throughout development rather than estimating an overall effect. We note that even though our model cannot represent the full microscopic truth underlying the mtDNA bottleneck, its ability to recapitulate the wide range of extant experimental measurements suggest that its study may yield useful insights into the effects of different treatments and perturbations on the bottleneck."

Our study shows that observed increases in heteroplasmy variance (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jenuth et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wai et al., 2008</a>) can be achieved across this range of potential minimal mtDNA copy numbers, meaning that the much-debated magnitude of mtDNA copy number reduction is not the sole critical feature of the bottleneck, in agreement with arguments from <a href=\"#bib12\">Cao et al. (2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2009)</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wai et al. (2008)</a>.

We cannot, given current experimental evidence, discount hybrid mechanisms, where BDP dominates the population dynamics but small contributions from other mechanisms provide perturbations to this behaviour, and propose experiments to conclusively distinguish between these cases (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). As the expected statistics of mtDNA populations undergoing inheritance of heteroplasmic mtDNA clusters is very similar to those undergoing binomial partitioning of mtDNAs (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>), the inheritance of heteroplasmic nucleoids (as opposed to individual mtDNAs) is not excluded by our findings, though other recent experimental evidence suggests that this situation may be unlikely (<a href=\"#bib49\">Poe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jakobs and Wurm, 2014</a>). We contend that the most likely situation may involve the partitioning of individual organelles, containing a mixture of homoplasmic nucleoids of characteristic size &lt;2. Notably, this case (inheritance of heteroplasmic groups, likely with fluid structure due to mixing of organellar content and mitochondrial dynamics), gives rise to statistics which our binomial model reproduces (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>)."

Mitochondrial dynamics may also influence the elements of partitioning, through changes in the connectivity of the mitochondrial network. In our current model, these influences are coarse-grained into descriptions of the dynamic rates of mtDNA replication and degradation, and the characteristic elements that are partitioned at divisions. These physical parameters, as opposed to the more microscopic details of mitochondrial dynamics, are expected to be the key determinants of heteroplasmy statistics through development. Accounting for how these parameters, which summarize the relevant outputs of mitochondrial dynamics, connect to details of microscopic models of mitochondrial dynamics is an important future research direction to be addressed when more quantitative data is available."

We note that the results of a recent study of human preimplantation sampling (<a href=\"#bib64\">Treff et al., 2012</a>) found that earlier measurements provided strong predictive power of mean heteroplasmy, about which substantial variation was recorded in the offspring\u2014both of which results are consistent with the application of our model to theoretical sampling considerations.

We have used new experimental measurements to confirm our theoretical findings, illustrating the beneficial and powerful coupling of mathematical and experimental approaches to address competing hypotheses in the literature. Our detailed elucidation of the bottleneck allows us to propose further experimental methodology to address the current unknowns in our theory, including the specifics of mtDNA partitioning at cell division and the roles of selective differences between mtDNA types; importantly, we also propose a strategy to investigate our claim that our most supported model is compatible with the subset-replication picture of mtDNA dynamics. We list these experiments in full in <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>. Finally, we believe that the theoretical foundation for mtDNA dynamics that we have produced allows increased quantitative rigour in the predictions and strategies involved in mtDNA disease therapies, illustrated by the above application of our theory to problems in mtDNA sampling strategies, disease onset timescales, and interventions to increase the power of the bottleneck."

We also constrain copy number to be &lt;5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> at all points throughout development, rejecting parameterisation that disobey this criterion. Metropolis MCMC was used to identify the best-fit parameterisation according to this distance function. For statistical inference, we use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a statistical approach that has successfully been applied to parametric inference and model selection in dynamical systems (<a href=\"#bib63\">Toni et al., 2009</a>) to infer posterior probability distributions both for individual models and the parameters of the models given experimental data. ABC samples posterior probability distributions on parameters that lead to behaviour within a certain threshold distance of the given data; these posteriors are shown to converge on the true posteriors as the threshold value decreases to zero (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). We employed an MCMC sampler with randomly-selected initial conditions. For further details, including priors, thresholds and step sizes used in ABC, see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>.

The proportion between HB derived and C57BL/6N mtDNA was determined by ARMS-qPCR assays based on a SNP in mt-rnr2 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burgstaller et al., 2014</a>). These assays were normalised to changes in the input mtDNA amount by consensus assays, located in conserved regions of mt\u2013Co2 and mt\u2013Co3 (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). For the calculation of mtDNA heteroplasmy, the assay detecting the minor allele (C57BL/6N or wild-derived &lt;50%) was always used. If both specific assays gave values &gt;50% (which can happen around 50% heteroplasmy), the mean value of both assays was taken. All qPCR runs contained no template controls (NTCs) for all assays; these were negative in 100%. Further experimental details available in <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>."

This reasoning also extends to the different phases of replication and degradation, allowing an exact generating function to be constructed for an arbitrary point in the bottleneck. Derivatives of this generating function are then used to obtain moments of the distributions of interest. The full procedure is given in <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>.

This is not correct, and I made this point in my earlier review of the paper. Their reference (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cree et al., 2008</a>) includes such a \u2018bottom up\u2019 model. Although the compartments did not vary in that model, assumptions were made about the partitioning which are in accordance with the conclusions of this current paper."

In particular, it looks as if the spread of the normalised variance itself has interesting dynamics, starting out low, increasing to a maximum at around 25 dpc before diminishing again. Is there any way in which the BDP model can capture these dynamics?

It would appear that prior attempts in this direction have been limited in scope and inconclusive. The strength of the authors' approach is that it is able to unify previous treatments of the phenomenon into a single theoretical framework. From this position, it is possible to assess the plausibility of the various mechanisms within a Bayesian statistical analysis. Using prior data, the authors conclude that a birth-death-partition model is most probable. This model is analytically tractable which is also advantageous. These are powerful conclusions, and it would seem absolutely certain that progress in this field is going to require an analysis of this sort, due to the inherent complexity (and stochasticity) of the problem."

I appreciate that the authors' statistical analysis takes into account the experimental uncertainty, but the divergence between the different experimental data sets found in the different studies suggests that the effective experimental error bars may be much bigger than estimated. The ability to distinguish between the models via Bayesian model comparison may then be diminished. This point is important, as there is relatively little difference between the models with respect to the mean values (whose experimental values are also well clustered between the various data sets). Hence it does seem that the variances are the key to distinguishing between the models. Also the statistical inference is based around a residual sum of squares difference. However, the way this was implemented (using logs of the copy number measurements, for example) seemed a bit arbitrary. Were other possibilities investigated to ensure consistency?"

Given that heteroplasmy levels are bound by 0% and 100%, any factors pushing the level in a particular direction will inevitably alter the range of values.

The possibility of selective pressures acting to change heteroplasmy in our models, in addition to the necessity of dealing with samples with different heteroplasmies, is the reason that we (and others) use the normalised heteroplasmy variance V'(<i>h</i>) throughout our work. This quantity corrects for the modulation of heteroplasmy variance V(<i>h</i>) by mean heteroplasmy E<i>(h</i>), and in so doing attempts to remove the effects of selective differences. This protocol has been used in previous work dealing with the NZB/Black mouse system which experience some (small) selective differences (Sharpley et al. Cell 151 333 (2012)). We have now drawn attention to this protocol in the main text. The influence of selective differences on observed heteroplasmy variance in our model can easily be computed by back-transforming the predicted normalised variance using the expected mean heteroplasmy, as can be seen from the structure of the transformation."

Copy number control in our simple model is achieved through replication and degradation rates that balance to produce the desired behaviour. The two rates can be varied in concert to maintain this behaviour while changing the timescale of mtDNA turnover, this is what we plot in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>. In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> we show the effects of perturbing this control by varying the rates independently.

The comparable perturbation to a model applying control based, for example, upon a specific target copy number would be to vary the value of this target."

Second, and more importantly, we include these results a quantification of these (perhaps qualitative intuitive) effects, making a numerical prediction regarding, for example, how much mtDNA reduction is required for a given increase in variance. Experimental tests of these predictions form part of our proposed strategies for further elucidation of the model."
