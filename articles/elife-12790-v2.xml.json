Tethering is the process by which partner membranes are brought together into close proximity to permit their subsequent fusion (<a href=\"#bib19\">Pfeffer, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Sztul and Lupashin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Yu and Hughson, 2010</a>). Two classes of transport vesicle tethers have been described to date: multi-subunit complexes such as the Exocyst, COG, Dsl1 and TRAPP complexes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Br\u00f6cker et al., 2010</a>), and larger, dimeric coiled-coil containing proteins such as p115 and EEA1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Sztul and Lupashin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Munro, 2011</a>). Both classes share the ability to bind to Rab GTPases, SNARE proteins and vesicle coat complexes, suggesting that they play important roles in coordinating molecular events important for target recognition and membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib23\">Short et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Sinka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hayes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hughson and Reinisch, 2010</a>)."

They are anchored to the Golgi via their C-termini, and models suggest that they protrude long distances, relying on the relative rigidity of the coiled coil structure to provide a meshwork that can capture vesicles in the vicinity of the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib29\">Yu and Hughson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Munro, 2011</a>). GCC185 is a Golgin required for the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from late endosomes to the trans Golgi network (<a href=\"#bib20\">Reddy, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Derby et al., 2007</a>). Cells depleted of GCC185 accumulate MPRs in Rab9 GTPase- and AP-1-decorated transport carriers (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hayes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Reddy, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brown et al., 2011</a>), providing an assay for GCC185 tethering capacity. GCC185 is likely anchored on the TGN surface by cooperative binding of its C-terminus to both Rab6 and Arl1 GTPases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burguete et al., 2008</a>). We (<a href=\"#bib20\">Reddy, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burguete et al., 2008</a>) and others (<a href=\"#bib9\">Derby, 2004</a>) have shown that GCC185 binds Arl1 rather weakly, but Rab6A binding greatly enhances Arl1 interaction (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burguete et al., 2008</a>). Arl1\u2019s role in anchoring GCC185 was questioned because it seemed not to be required if siRNA-depleted by 80% (<a href=\"#bib13\">Houghton et al., 2009</a>); in fact, 90% depletion of Arl1 is required to displace GCC185 from membranes and to detect its role in Golgi localization of the GCC185 C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burguete et al., 2008</a>)."

Moreover, once they bind vesicles, what happens next? Many coiled-coil tethers contain putative hinges, located between predicted rod-like, coiled-coil domains (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barr and Short, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lupas et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Munro, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Pfeffer, 1999</a>). Do these regions function as hinges? We have taken a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the mechanism of vesicle tethering by a trans Golgi network (TGN)-associated Golgin, GCC185. Our data provide novel insight into the tethering process and suggest that the TGN Golgin, GCC185, uses an unexpected mechanism to accomplish vesicle tethering."

To determine the protein\u2019s actual length, we expressed and purified an N-terminally GFP-FLAG-tagged, GCC185 wild type in HEK293 cells. To test models of vesicle tethering that invoke tether bending, we also generated a '\u25b3hinge' construct missing two potential hinge domains near the middle of the protein that were selected based upon predicted breaks in coiled coil sequences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; \u25b3751-805, \u25b3890-939). The wild type protein migrated at ~220\u00a0kD upon SDS-PAGE; GCC185 \u25b3hinge was somewhat smaller (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Purified GCC185 was imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) after application onto a mica surface. AFM of GCC185 under physiological buffer conditions revealed the molecule as a parallel dimer of ~145 nm in length with splayed ends (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>). The N-terminal, globular GFP moiety could often be visualized; the C-terminal, smaller 'GRIP domain' could also be detected. GCC185 contains numerous cysteine residues (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>); it was important to include dithiothreitol to mimic the reducing environment of the cytoplasm for all experiments."

However, GFP-GCC185-\u25b3hinge yielded a significantly weaker PLA signal when compared with cells expressing GFP-GCC185 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). This suggests strongly that the flexibility-conferring regions facilitate the ability of the N- and C-termini to achieve proximity on the Golgi. Quantitation of PLA signal intensity as a function of protein expression confirmed the importance of the hinge region for proximity ligation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Only at higher expression levels was proximity detected for the GCC185-\u25b3hinge construct; at high expression levels, these are likely to represent inter- rather than intra-molecular processes. These experiments show that the presence of a flexible region is needed for GCC185 function and permits the N- and C-termini to become closer together, on the Golgi, in cells. It should be noted that proximity ligation could indicate bending/flexing of individual proteins or inter-digitation of two different proteins in anti-parallel orientation; we favor the former explanation, as it is hard to imagine that hinge deletion would influence the possibility of inter-digitation."

The presence of multiple Rab-binding sites along the length of individual Golgin proteins (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sinka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hayes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Short et al., 2001</a>) has led others to suggest that vesicles may hop along individual tethers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barr and Short, 2003</a>) or be captured by Golgin \u2018tentacles\u2019 within a potential Golgin meshwork towards the target membrane (<a href=\"#bib18\">Munro, 2011</a>). Such a model considers tethers as rigid, extended rods (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, left). Our data favor a model whereby GCC185 is C-terminally anchored to the TGN through Rab6 and Arl1 GTPases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burguete et al., 2008</a>) and captures Rab9-decorated transport vesicles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hayes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Reddy, 2006</a>) by binding them at the N-terminus and/or near the hinge region (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brown et al., 2011</a>); importantly, the central bubble gives significant flexibility to the protein and would allow it to collapse onto the Golgi surface, bringing vesicles close to the trans Golgi target membrane (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). GCC185 can bind multiple Rab GTPases along its length (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hayes et al., 2009</a>), as well as syntaxin16, Arl1 and Arl4 GTPases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burguete et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ganley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lin et al., 2011</a>).

                        "text": "We have shown here that the functionally essential, GCC185 N-terminus has the capacity to bind to transport vesicles in vitro. N-terminal vesicle binding is shared with GMAP-210, a Golgin localized to the cis-Golgi (<a href=\"#bib22\">Sato et al., 2015</a>); for other Golgins, it is presumed due to binding sites for various coat proteins. In previous work (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brown et al., 2011</a>), we showed that GCC185 residues 938\u20131032 comprise an AP-1 binding site that is also needed for GCC185 vesicle tethering (blue bar in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>); the transport vesicles are AP-1 decorated, thus this was presumed to represent a possible vesicle binding site. This AP-1 binding site is located immediately downstream of the regions deleted in the \u25b3hinge protein studied here (751-805, 890939) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Moreover, an apparently dispensible, Rab9 GTPase binding site is located directly between the two deletions made to generate the \u25b3hinge mutant (orange bar, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Binding of Rab9 to that site could influence the ability of that part of the protein to form a bubble, and could influence the efficiency of tethering on a time scale finer than that assayed here and previously. Both Rab9 and AP-1 are present on the transport vesicles captured, but we do not yet know the precise molecular interaction underlying the ability of the N-terminal domain to bind vesicles. That a splayed N-terminus is utilized suggests that the tether gains efficiency by avidity, and can reach out to 'hug' the vesicle. How the various binding sites along GCC185 coordinate interactions with the vesicle and the target membrane to accomplish vesicle tethering represents an important area for future work."

The model in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> is drawn to scale and assumes that the transport vesicles are ~50 nm in diameter (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barbero, 2002</a>); they need not be larger to be able to occupy both potential vesicle binding domains. The AP-1 binding site (939\u20131,031)is essential for GCC185\u2019s role in vesicle tethering but not Golgi ribbon maintenance (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brown et al., 2011</a>), and must be considered in any model of GCC185 vesicle tethering."

This observation highlights the fact that workers in this field have oversimplified thinking about how tethers function\u2014simple engagement of N- and C-termini is not sufficient for both vesicle capture and Golgi ribbon stabilization. A recent paper studying Golgi tethers (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wong and Munro, 2014</a>) concluded that unlike other TGN tethers, GCC185 could not tether vesicles upon re-localization to mitochondria. The extent of Golgi membrane mobilization seen in that study was far greater than the small pool size of the much rarer, Rab9-containing, AP-1 positive, mannose phosphate receptor transport vesicle intermediates\u2014that are only visualized in cells upon depletion of tethering factors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Reddy, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brown et al., 2011</a>). It is very possible that that study assayed the ability of TGN tethers to recruit/assemble TGN ribbons, rather than capture rare transport vesicle intermediates. Since ribbon assembly and transport vesicle capture are driven by separate domains of GCC185, perhaps GCC185 is more potent in vesicle tethering rather than Golgi ribbon assembly."

Whatever the explanation, the floppy appearance of purified GCC185, when deposited on mica in the absence of fixative, and the proximity of GCC185\u2019s N- and C-termini on the Golgi in cells, argue strongly against this protein behaving like a pipe cleaner, protruding on the surface of the trans Golgi network in cells.

After 8 minutes, the mica surface was gently rinsed with 2 ml buffer followed by 2 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>0 to remove unbound proteins and dried by soft argon flow. Imaging was done in air with a Park100 AFM (Park Systems, Santa Clara, CA) operated in non-contact mode. We used ultra-sharp diamond-like carbon probes (NSG10 DLC, ~2\u20135 nm radius of curvature at the tip (K-Tek Nanotechnology, Wilsonville, OR) driven near resonance at ~200 kHz. To minimize both sample and tip damage during scanning, the set point was set to the largest possible value (largest average tip-sample distance) that allowed good surface tracking. Raster scans (1.2 \u03bcm X 1.2 \u03bcm) were performed at a resolution of 512x512 pixels with a scan rate of 1Hz. For presentation and analysis, images were first processed using a custom Matlab script (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source code 1</a> provided) to remove sample slant (flattening) by row and column-wise median subtraction."

The number of selected molecules usually covered 40\u201370% of all the objects in the field, depending on the distribution of molecules and local quality of an image. To quantify the conformation of each molecule, a selected molecule was segmented into maximally 8 sections based on apparent structural features. The length of each segment (X1 to X8) was measured with ImageJ by setting the measuring scale with the known image spatial size and outlining the molecule contour with the segmented line tool."

They demonstrate that two central hinge regions of GCC185 are required for GCC185 function in cells, and that these hinges can be replaced by synthetic flexible linkers (Gly-Ser repeats) to restore function. Proximity ligation is used to demonstrate that the N- and C-termini of GCC185 can be located within 40 nm of each other (despite a predicted length of ~200 nm for a rigid GCC185 molecule). Importantly, this proximity required the hinge region."

This is interesting because the authors also show that that the N-terminus of GCC185 can capture Rab9/CI-MPR vesicles from a crude vesicle fraction. Interestingly, the orientation of this N-terminus fused to GST is important \u2013 the more physiological chimera performs best."

In <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, is the size of the vesicle shown to scale relative to the GCC185 molecule (which the authors have now measured precisely)? Some discussion of these issues is merited and should be included in a revised manuscript.</i> "
