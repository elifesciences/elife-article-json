Prokaryotes, higher plants, fungi, animals and algae use light-sensing systems that encompass a variety of sensory photoreceptors that respond to different wavelengths of light. Recently, a new type of blue light photoreceptor termed Aureochrome (Aureo) was discovered in the photosynthetic stramenopile alga <i>Vaucheria frigida</i> that has been suggested to function as blue light-regulated transcription factor. Originally, two Aureo homologs, named Aureo 1 and 2, were identified, but only Aureo1 was shown to bind DNA in a light-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib40\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>). Since the discovery of the first Aureos, several orthologs from other stramenopile algae such as <i>Ochromonas danica, Fucus distichus, Saccharina japonica</i> and <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> have been identified (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ishikawa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Deng et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schellenberger Costa et al., 2013</a>). The diatom <i>P. tricornutum</i> has four genes encoding aureochromes: three orthologs of type 1 (<i>Pt</i>Au1a, b and c) and one of type 2 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Depauw et al., 2012</a>). Only <i>Pt</i>Au1a has\u00a0been functionally characterized so far and is\u00a0shown to be involved in light-dependent mitosis regulation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Huysman et al., 2013</a>) and repress high-light acclimation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schellenberger Costa et al., 2013</a>)."

LOV domains are a subgroup of the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) superfamily that sense blue light using a noncovalently bound flavin cofactor (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Herrou and Crosson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Losi and Gartner, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Conrad et al., 2014</a>). Photon absorption of the flavin results in formation of a flavin-C4(a)-cysteinyl adduct with a conserved cysteine residue (<a href=\"#bib36\">Salomon et al., 2000</a>), which initiates a cascade of structural rearrangements within the LOV core that are propagated to the domain boundaries. LOV domains can be found as isolated entities, but are often part of multidomain proteins where they are coupled to a variety of different effector domains. The effector-sensor topology observed in Aureos differs from the domain topology found in most other LOV photoreceptors where the sensory LOV domain is located N-terminally to the effector domain. This rare domain topology raises the question of how light signaling is achieved in Aureos compared with other LOV proteins."

This hypothesis was supported to some extent by the crystal structure of the <i>Vf</i>Au1 LOV domain that showed an unexpected dimeric arrangement (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mitra et al., 2012</a>). However, this structure was determined from crystals grown in the dark and it remains unclear whether the observed dimeric LOV arrangement represents the biologically relevant light state dimer. To obtain insights into structural rearrangements within V<i>f</i>Au1 LOV upon light\u00a0activation, dark state crystals were illuminated to study light-induced conformational changes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mitra et al., 2012</a>). However, crystal lattice constraints can prevent large conformational changes\u00a0that limit\u00a0this approach. Therefore, the mechanism of light-induced LOV dimerization and its consequences on DNA binding in Aureos remain unclear."

Together with functional studies, this integrative structural approach enabled us to establish a model for light\u00a0signaling in Aureos where, in the dark, the LOV domain directly interacts with the bZIP domain and thereby impedes its DNA binding function. Illumination with blue light triggers intramolecular bZIP\u2013LOV dissociation and subsequent LOV dimerization, thus enhancing the affinity of <i>Pt</i>Au1a for its target DNA sequence. Together, these results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of Aureo function and implicate a new model of light-dependent gene regulation by Aureos in stramenopiles. In addition, they offer new design strategies for synthetic Aureo\u2013LOV based photosensors for applications in optogenetics."

Quantification of the average molar mass of <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full\u00a0</sub>(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) and <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV\u00a0</sub>(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>) in the dark and light state yielded similar values of 55.1, 53.3, 31.7 and 33.7 kDa, respectively, which are between the theoretically expected molar masses of dimers (83.6 kDa for <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and 52.6 for <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub>) and monomers (41.8 kDa for <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and 26.3 kDa for <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub>). Peak tailing and a continuous decrease of the molar\u00a0mass signal in the dark and light state of <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> suggested an equilibrium between dimers and monomers irrespective of the light conditions. Illumination-induced small differences in the elution volumes, indicating conformational changes of both protein variants have occurred as also reported for <i>Vf</i>Au1 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Toyooka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hisatomi et al., 2013</a>). In contrast to <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub>, light activation of <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> shifts the oligomerization state from monomers to dimers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). The change in oligomerization state is reflected by a decrease of the elution volume from 16.2 ml (dark) to 15.2 ml (light) and an increase of the calculated average molar mass from 20 kDa (dark) to 28 kDa (light). Quantification of the monomer\u2013dimer transition using microscale thermophoresis (MST) revealed a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 13.6 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b5M for the dark adapted protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>) and pre-illumination of <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> increased the dimerization ability as expected from the MALS measurements (data not shown). However, it was not possible to determine a reliable <i>K<sub>d</sub> </i>value for the monomer\u2013dimer transition of light-activated <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub>, as continuous illumination of the protein is not possible during the measurements. Together, our results are in line with previous reports on the oligomerization states of the LOV domain of <i>Pt</i>Au1a (<a href=\"#bib13\">Herman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Herman and Kottke, 2015</a>) as well as truncated and full-length variants of <i>Vf</i>Au1 in their dark and light states (<a href=\"#bib43\">Toyooka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hisatomi et al., 2013</a>). It was recently reported that <i>Vf</i>Au1 dimerizes in a light-dependent manner and that the redox\u00a0potential influences the oligomerization state by formation of disulfide bonds between the bZIP domains and the bZIP\u2013LOV linker regions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hisatomi et al., 2014</a>). We did not observe such light-dependent oligomerization in our experiments and can also rule out an influence of the redox\u00a0potential on the oligomerization state of <i>Pt</i>Au1a, as <i>Pt</i>Au1a does not possess cysteine residues outside the LOV domain."

The DNA probe (388 nM) was incubated in buffer D without MgCl<sub>2</sub>\u00a0(<b>a</b>) and with MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<b>b</b>) with varying amounts of purified <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> (2, 4, 7.9, 15.9, 31.8, 63.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 nM). EMSA runs were performed as described in the methods section. In the EMSA in the absence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, the formation of a <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub>-DNA complex is already observed at the lowest protein concentration of 2 nM. At protein concentrations above 250 nM, a second <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub>-DNA band appears, which was also observed in gel shift experiments performed by Takahashi et. al. (<a href=\"#bib40\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>) and in DNA binding studies of the CREB bZIP domain (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moll et al., 2002</a>). This slower migrating band most likely represents two <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> dimers bound to the 35-bp DNA probe, indicating the ability of unspecific DNA binding of <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> at high protein concentrations. In the EMSAs performed in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, the formation of a stable <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub>-DNA complex is observed at much higher protein concentrations compared with the experiments without MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, the slower migrating <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub>-DNA band disappeared, indicating sequence-specific DNA binding of a single <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> dimer to the target DNA sequence.

The dark state structure revealed a LOV monomer that adopts a typical PAS fold consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet flanked by several helices. The LOV core forms the chromophore binding pocket and closely resembles the structure of <i>Vf</i>Au1 LOV (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mitra et al., 2012</a>) (root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d) between 0.42 and 0.58 \u00c5 for 101 C<sup>\u03b1</sup> atoms and molecules A and B <i>Pt</i>Au1a and A,B,C,D,E,F for <i>Vf</i>Au1a). The LOV core is flanked at the N- and C-termini by prominent \u03b1-helical extensions denoted A\u00b4\u03b1 and J\u03b1, respectively. As observed for <i>Vf</i>Au1 LOV (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mitra et al., 2012</a>), the C-terminal J\u03b1 helix partially folds back onto the surface of the \u03b2-sheet and interacts with the LOV core via hydrogen bonds between the conserved residue Gln365 and the carbonyl and amine group of Cys316 as well as the side chains of Tyr357 and Gln330. A\u00b4\u03b1 forms an amphipathic three-turn helix and interacts with the LOV core through a highly conserved 4 amino acid linker with Ala248, Glu249, Glu250 and Gln251 in the hinge region. In addition to J\u03b1, A\u00b4\u03b1 also\u00a0folds back across the surface of the \u03b2-sheet and covers a large hydrophobic patch (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). The chromophore binding pocket is mainly formed by hydrophobic residues that stabilize the FMN chromophore together with Gln350, Gln291, Asn319, Asn329, which form hydrogen bonds with the heteroatoms of the isoalloxazine ring. FMN is additionally stabilized by Arg304 and Arg288, which interact with the phosphate group of the ribityl chain. The conserved photoreactive Cys287, which forms a covalent bond with FMN upon illumination, is located in the E\u03b1 helix on the opposite site of the core \u03b2-sheet."

                                "text": "Light-induced dimerization of <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> requires tertiary and quaternary structural rearrangements that cannot be induced by illumination of dark state crystals due to crystal lattice restraints. Therefore, to detect the full extent of light-induced structural changes, crystals of the light state need to be grown under continuous blue light illumination of the setup. The increase in structural dynamics and aggregation tendency upon illumination of most photoreceptors as well as potential photobleaching makes crystallization of photoreceptors difficult and has so far only been achieved for the single LOV domain proteins VIVID (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vaidya et al., 2011</a>) and PpsB1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Circolone et al., 2012</a>) as well as for a truncated phytochrome construct (<a href=\"#bib41\">Takala et al., 2014</a>). These photoreceptors revert slowly back into their dark conformation or, as in the case of VIVID, have been modified to do so. To obtain the structure of a fully\u00a0light-adapted <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> dimer, we set up crystallization screens of wildtype <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> under continuous blue light illumination and obtained colorless crystals overnight. Their lack of color is indicative of formation of the flavin-C4(a)-cysteinyl adduct. As expected from the MALS measurements, light-activated <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> crystallized as a dimer that features an assembly similar to other N-cap-comprising PAS dimers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Heintz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ayers and Moffat, 2008</a>). The two <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> protomers are related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry that does not apply to the A\u00b4\u03b1 helices. The observed parallel dimer arrangement differs significantly from the antiparallel dimer arrangement observed for the dark state structure of <i>Vf</i>Au1 LOV (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mitra et al., 2012</a>). Analysis of the contact area using the <i>PISA</i> web server revealed a buried surface area (BSA) of 1524 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, which is similar to that observed for the VIVID light state dimer (1342 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>), supporting the observed dimer arrangement as biologically relevant. The main dimerization interface is formed by a network of hydrophobic residues on the core \u03b2-sheet and A\u00b4\u03b1. Superposition of the dark and light state structures not only reveals a variety of light-induced side chain rearrangements (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but also a significant change of the position of the A\u00b4\u03b1 helix that is released from the hydrophobic patch on the LOV core, thus exposing the dimerization site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). Compared with the dark state structure, the C-terminal part of J\u03b1 is unstructured and the hydrogen bonds between Gln365 and the carbonyl and amine group of Cys316 are broken, indicating light-induced J\u03b1 undocking from the LOV \u03b2-sheet and subsequent unfolding as suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib13\">Herman et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, the side chains of Cys316 and Leu317 located on strand G\u03b2 also undergo conformational changes upon illumination, which may promote light-induced J\u03b1 undocking from the LOV core. J\u03b1 seems to contribute directly to the stability of the light state dimer by interacting with A'\u03b1 of the second protomer. However, the effect of these interactions needs to be interpreted with caution since the conformations of the A\u00b4\u03b1 helices differ between the two protomers (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This could either originate from intrinsic asymmetry of the <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> light-state dimer or from asymmetry induced by crystal contacts (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The formation of the covalent Cys287\u2013FMN adduct and the resulting doming of the isoalloxazine ring at position C4a are supported by the F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> omit map and the 2F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> map (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Light-induced rotamer changes were observed for a variety of residues predominantly in the vicinity of the FMN cofactor (Leu317, Phe331 and Ile333) or on the outer side of strand I\u03b2 (Cys 351) and G\u03b2 (Met 313). Additionally, the highly conserved Tyr266 located on strand B\u03b2 shows a light-induced rotation out of the dimer interface, which is prerequisite for LOV dimerization."

                                "text": "To relate light-induced LOV dimerization to the enhanced DNA binding of <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> in the light and to identify structural elements involved in light signaling, we performed HDX-MS measurements comparing deuterium uptake of dark- and light-adapted <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> in the absence and presence of DNA as well as of dark- and light adapted <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub>. Measurements on <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> confirmed the important role of A\u00b4\u03b1 for dimer formation and revealed slightly reduced deuterium incorporation into fast-exchanging amides of A\u00b4\u03b1 in light-adapted <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub>\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>). After longer exchange times, all except one of the A\u00b4\u03b1 peptides show the opposite effect and exhibit slightly increased deuterium incorportation. (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Analysis of the peptide overlap showed that the observed destabilization originates from an increased exchange of the amide proton of Phe252 that is located on strand A\u03b2 and is part of the <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> dimerization site that is covered by A\u00b4\u03b1 in the dark state crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). In the dark as well as light state structure, the Phe252 amide proton is in hydrogen bonding distance to the hydroxyl group of Ser268 located between strand B\u03b2 and helix C\u03b1 that is also destabilized at later time points, suggesting interaction of these elements. Decreased conformational dynamics is observed for helix E\u03b1 encompassing the photoreactive cysteine that forms the covalent Cys287-FMN adduct upon illumination. Structural stabilization is observed for the end of strand H\u03b2 with its adjacent loop that is in hydrogen bonding distance to B\u03b2 upon dimer formation. Only negligible light-induced differences in deuterium uptake are observed for J\u03b1 that was shown to unwind upon illumination (<a href=\"#bib13\">Herman et al., 2013</a>) and that is also partially unstructured in the light state crystal structure. This originates from the fact that J\u03b1 is highly dynamic already in the dark and amide hydrogen exchange is too rapid to detect a further light-induced increase of the hydrogen exchange rate of J\u03b1 due to the limited time resolution of the chosen HDX-MS approach. Similar results were also reported for HDX-MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on the isolated LOV2 domain of photoropin 1 from <i>Avena sativa</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Winkler et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Harper et al., 2003</a>). In addition to J\u03b1, A\u00b4\u03b1 is also highly dynamic and shows a high degree of deuterium incorporation in the dark and light (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>). The moderate protection observed for the crystallographic <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> light state dimer interface upon illumination is in line with HDX-MS measurements performed on VIVID (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2014</a>) and suggests a rapid monomer\u2013dimer interconversion. Thus, the HDX-MS data obtained for <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> highlight the important role of A\u00b4\u03b1 for light-induced dimerization and support the observed dimer arrangement in the crystal structure also in solution."

Additionally, elements within the bZIP DNA-binding domain are significantly destabilized, whereas the N-terminal domain and bZIP\u2013LOV linker region are mainly unaffected by LOV activation. The deuterium exchange behavior determined for LOV domain peptides of light-activated <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and free <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> are nearly identical, indicating no differences in the conformation or interaction state of the free or effector-coupled LOV domain in the light state (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, the pronounced differences in deuterium exchange of the LOV and bZIP domains between dark- and light-adapted protein can be explained by a direct interaction between the two domains in the dark, which is broken upon illumination and subsequent LOV dimerization."

Peptides within this region revealed bimodal exchange behavior, indicative of two distinct protein populations with slow interconversion and significantly different deuterium exchange kinetics (EX1 kinetics (<a href=\"#bib23\">Konermann, Pan, and Liu, 2011</a>)), which might reflect bZIP\u2013LOV dissociation during labeling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Interestingly, A\u00b4\u03b1 as well as elements of I\u03b2 and the beginning of J\u03b1 show a significant increase in deuterium uptake upon illumination and exhibit exchange kinetics similar to those observed for the leucine zipper peptides around residues 176-184, suggesting functional interplay or direct interaction of these elements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b\u2013d</a>). Structural destabilization is observed for helix F\u03b1 and its adjacent linker regions as well as H\u03b2 and the loop between G\u03b2 and H\u03b2. Since slowly exchanging amides are involved in the exchange of the aforementioned elements, the observed destabilization can be interpreted as an increase in structural dynamics. The N-terminal domain as well as the linker connecting the bZIP and LOV domain show rapid deuterium uptake in the dark and light, which identifies these regions as highly dynamic and probably unstructured as also suggested from secondary structure prediction (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Subtle light-induced structural destabilization was observed for the region between residues 28 and 44 of the N-terminal domain, which suggests that illumination also affects the function of the N-terminal domain."

Additionally, light-adapted <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> exhibits a high degree of flexibility and populates a variety of different conformations.

The N- and C-terminal A'\u03b1 and J\u03b1 helices flanking the LOV core play a central role in this process and are directly affected by illumination as also observed for phototropin-LOV2 from <i>Av. sativa</i> and <i>A. thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zayner, Antoniou, and Sosnick, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Takeda et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Harper, Neil, and Gardner, 2003</a>). In the dark, A'\u03b1 covers the hydrophobic dimerization site of the LOV \u03b2-sheet that becomes exposed upon illumination and thus enables LOV dimerization. These results provide a molecular mechanism for recent size-exclusion chromatography experiments performed on isolated <i>Pt</i>Au1a LOV constructs lacking A'\u03b1 and/or J\u03b1 that also imply that A'\u03b1 covers the LOV dimerization site in the dark (<a href=\"#bib14\">Herman and Kottke, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Herman et al., 2013</a>). However, not only A'\u03b1, but also J\u03b1 is affected by blue light illumination. It undocks from the LOV \u03b2-sheet and partially unfolds. The light-induced structural changes observed for A'\u03b1 and J\u03b1 are in line with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy studies that also indicate light-induced structural changes in both helices (<a href=\"#bib14\">Herman and Kottke, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Herman et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, it was reported that A'\u03b1 is only affected by illumination in the presence and after unfolding of J\u03b1, whereas J\u03b1 unfolds even in the absence of A'\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Herman and Kottke, 2015</a>). Since a direct interaction between the two helices is not observed in the dark state <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> crystal structure, the interdependence between A'\u03b1 and J\u03b1 indicates an allosteric interplay between the two helices as suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib14\">Herman and Kottke, 2015</a>). Allosteric signaling occurs via the LOV \u03b2-sheet and involves the central strand I\u03b2, which is covalently coupled to J\u03b1 and also interacts with A'\u03b1 in the dark. The important role of the LOV \u03b2-sheet in light-signaling is supported by the fact that several \u03b2-sheet residues show light-induced rotamer changes. Since the dimer arrangement observed in the <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> light state structure differs from the dimeric assembly observed in the recently determined dark state crystal structure of <i>Vf</i>Au1 LOV (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mitra et al., 2012</a>), it can be concluded that a combination of light-induced structural rearrangements within the LOV core together with undocking of J\u03b1 from the \u03b2-sheet are required to trigger the release of A'\u03b1 from the LOV core, which ultimately induces the formation of the biologically relevant light state dimer. In contrast to the consecutive structural changes reported for the flanking helices of <i>Pt</i>Au1a LOV, A'\u03b1 and J\u03b1 of phototropin-LOV2 exhibit structural changes independently of each other (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zayner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Takeda et al., 2013</a>), which implies differences in the signaling mechanism of Aureos and Phototropins."

According to the first model, <i>Vf</i>Au1 is dimeric regardless of the light conditions and additional light-induced LOV dimerization enhances its affinity for DNA (<a href=\"#bib43\">Toyooka et al., 2011</a>). In the second model, DNA binding not only depends on the light, but also on the redox conditions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hisatomi et al., 2014</a>). Under reducing conditions, <i>Vf</i>Au1 exists as a monomer and blue light illumination changes the oligomerization state from monomers to dimers, thus increasing the affinity for its target DNA sequence. Under oxidizing conditions, intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed between the bZIP domains and the bZIP\u2013LOV linker regions, which induce <i>Vf</i>Au1 dimerization and enable light-independent DNA binding. We point out that <i>Pt</i>Au1a does not possess cysteine residues outside the LOV domain and is therefore unable to form such disulfide bonds. Consequently, an influence of the redox conditions on the DNA binding of <i>Pt</i>Au1a can be ruled out. Concerning light-induced changes in the oligomerization state, we could not detect indications for light-induced <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> oligomerization in any of our experiments. Instead, our data suggests a mechanism where the LOV domain directly interacts with the leucine zipper region of the bZIP domain in the dark, impeding its DNA binding function. Our HDX-MS data suggest that the LOV\u2013bZIP interaction might occur via the LOV \u03b2-sheet and directly involves A'\u03b1 as well as J\u03b1. Upon blue light illumination, structural changes occur within the LOV core that are transmitted to the flanking helices and result in bZIP\u2013LOV dissociation and subsequent LOV dimerization, thus increasing the affinity of <i>Pt</i>Au1a for its target DNA sequence (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Such an allosteric signaling mechanism not only explains the absence of changes in structural dynamics of the bZIP\u2013LOV linker region upon illumination, but also explains the need for the &gt; 30 amino acids long linker in Aureos, which is required to enable direct bZIP\u2013LOV interaction. Our model is further supported by recent data on N-terminally truncated and modified <i>Vf</i>Au1 constructs that also indicate an interaction between the leucine zipper and the LOV domain in the dark, although it was hypothesized that this interaction stabilizes the monomeric form of the synthetic proteins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakatani and Hisatomi, 2015</a>). Moreover, a mechanism involving light-induced release of the LOV domain from its interaction site on the bZIP domain is consistent with the general concept of LOV and PAS domain signaling via the \u03b2-sheet surface (<a href=\"#bib11\">Harper et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zoltowski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">M\u00f6glich et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nash et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Rivera-Cancel et al., 2014</a>). Since the cellular concentration of <i>Pt</i>Au1a\u00a0is not known, we cannot completely exclude a regulatory mechanism where light-induced LOV dimerization additionally influences the oligomerization state and thus DNA binding of <i>Pt</i>Au1a <i>in vivo</i>."

Detailed structural and functional characterization of the light- and dark-adapted states are required for elucidating how the light signal is transmitted from the light-sensing LOV to the effector domain. Our data for <i>Pt</i>Au1a not only contribute to the understanding of the modularity and allosteric light signaling in LOV proteins, but also provides important information for rational and structure-guided design of new optogenetic tools. In fact, our data also explain the underlying working mechanism of recently engineered Aureo LOV containing light-activatable synthetic transcription factors and receptor tyrosine kinases that are based on light-dependent homo-dimerization (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Grusch et al., 2014</a>). These successful applications of Aureo LOVs highlight their efficacy as photodimerizers. However, the full potential of Aureo LOV domains for the design of optogenetic devices has not been exploited yet. In addition to their dimerization ability, the concerted undocking of A'\u03b1, J\u03b1 as well as of the bZIP domain from the LOV core can be used for the design of new optogenetic tools. The light-sensitive bZIP\u2013LOV interaction observed in Aureos allows combining the engineering strategies developed for leucine\u00a0zippers and coiled\u00a0coils with the light-sensing function of LOV domains. This unique combination of different functionalities provided by Aureos offers new design strategies for robust and tightly controllable molecular switches that allow precise spatial and temporal control of biological processes."

To minimize X-ray-induced reduction of the covalent adduct formed in the light-adapted protein, <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> light state data was collected from three different spots on a single crystal and merged to obtain a complete data set. <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> dark and light state data were phased by molecular replacement using <i>Phaser</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) in <i>CCP4</i> and <i>Phaser</i> in <i>PHENIX</i>, respectively, with the Aureochrome 1 LOV domain (residues 219-317) from <i>Vaucheria frigida</i> (PDB code 3UE6, molecule A) and the <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> dark state structure without A'\u03b1 helix (residues 251-372) as the search models. The missing segments flanking the LOV core were manually built in <i>Coot</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and the structure refined in cycles of <i>phenix.refine</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Afonine et al., 2012</a>) refinement and manual re-building. R<sub>free</sub> values for the <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> dark and light state data sets were computed from 8% and 5% randomly chosen reflections not used during the refinement, respectively. The topology and parameter files for the covalent Cys287-FMN adduct were obtained by quantum chemical calculations (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fedorov et al., 2003</a>). Model quality was analyzed using the <i>MolProbity</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) validation tool as implemented in <i>PHENIX</i>. Both final models contained no outliers in the Ramachandran plot, with 100% of the residues in the favored region for the dark state structure of <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> and 96.2% for the light state structure. Atomic coordinates of the structures and structure-factor amplitudes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank as entries 5DKK and 5DKL. Analysis of the PtAu1a<sub>LOV</sub> light state dimer interface and the BSAs was performed using the Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblie service (PISA; v1.51) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</a>)."

The authors use size-exclusion chromatography, deuterium exchange MS measurements, SAXS measurements and x-ray crystallography to build a model of how illumination with blue light enhances the DNA binding affinity. According to their model, the LOV domain in the dark state binds to the bZIP DNA-binding domain. In the light state soem structural elements of the LOV domain are partially unfolded, allowing for a structural rearrangement that releases the LOV domain and triggers its dimerization."

The observed differences between the dark and light state of the bZIP domain containing <i>Pt</i>Au1a variants on the gel-filtration column are indeed very small and the respective dimers dissociate rapidly in the dark and light. We initially also expected a stabilization of the complex upon light-activation and subsequent LOV dimerization. However, we could not observe such stabilization for the <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> dimers in any of our SEC-MALS experiments. We did not observe light-induced dimerization of <i>Pt</i>Au1a either, which was suggested previously for <i>Vf</i>Au1 (Hisatomi et al. 2014). Our SEC-MALS data indicate that the <i>Pt</i>Au1a bZIP domain is a weak dimerization module in the absence of DNA. Indeed, it is even possible that the basic DNA binding region negatively affects bZIP dimerization due to strong repulsive electrostatic interaction between the positively charged subunits. The bZIP containing <i>Pt</i>Au1a variants show a low kinetic stability and mostly elute as monomers from the gel- filtration column. Since the majority of molecules elutes as monomers, a high local LOV domain concentration, which might contribute to dimer stability, is only present in a small fraction of the molecules. Additionally, the photocycle of the bZIP domain containing <i>Pt</i>Au1a constructs is relatively \u201cfast\u201d and a significant part of the molecules decays from the adduct- back to the dark-state during gel filtration. Direct comparison of the experiments performed for <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> and the bZIP domain containing <i>Pt</i>Au1a variants is complicated by the fact that the presence of the bZIP domain accelerates the recovery kinetic of the LOV domain about 1.8-fold (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Interpretation of the SEC elution profiles and potential shifts to lower and larger retention volumes of <i>Pt</i>Au1a is hardly possible, because of the intrinsic flexibility and large unstructured regions that enable <i>Pt</i>Au1a to adopt multiple conformations. We want to emphasize that interpretation of shifts in the elution profiles in the absence of molar mass information can easily result in misinterpretation of the data. For example: Initial MALS measurements in the absence of MgCl<sub>2</sub> in the dark revealed an average molar mass, which was above the theoretical expected value for dimers indicating non-specific protein oligomerization. Upon light activation of the LOV domain, these higher oligomers dissociated, which was reflected by a decrease in the detected molar mass signal. However, the elution profile of the light activated protein shifted towards lower retention volumes compared to that observed in the dark. In the absence of molar mass information, such data could be easily interpreted as light-induced dimer stabilization or dimerization of <i>Pt</i>Au1a."

For both protein variants the elution profile slightly shifts toward lower retention times with increasing protein concentration. Additionally, the detected average molar mass signal increased from 28.7 kDa (100 \u00b5M) to 35.1 kDa (200 \u00b5M) for <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> and from 48.4 kDa (100 \u00b5M) to 54.4 kDa (200 \u00b5M) for <i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>full</sub>."

Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that the kink in the SAXS density obtained for the (<i>Pt</i>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV)2</sub>-DNA complex is surprising. However, this is the reproducible result of our reconstructions. Since we currently do not have structural information for the bZIP- LOV linker region, which could explain this result, we cannot give a clear answer to this question. We are working toward obtaining structural information for this region and hope that we can provide an explanation for this interesting observation in the future."
