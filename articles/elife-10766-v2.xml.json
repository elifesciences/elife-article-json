Some integrins contain an I-domain that is a major ligand binding site. The ligands preferentially engage the active forms of the integrins and trigger signaling cascades that alter numerous cell functions. Here we found that the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA), a key virulence factor of the whooping cough agent <i>Bordetella pertussis,</i> preferentially binds an inactive form of the integrin complement receptor 3 (CR3), using a site outside of its I-domain. CyaA binding did not trigger downstream signaling of CR3 in human monocytes and CyaA-catalyzed elevation of cAMP effectively blocked CR3 signaling initiated by a natural ligand. This unprecedented type of integrin-ligand interaction distinguishes CyaA from all other known ligands of the I-domain-containing integrins and provides a mechanistic insight into the previously observed central role of CyaA in the pathogenesis of <i>B. pertussis</i>."

Some integrins contain an I-domain that is a major ligand binding site. The ligands preferentially engage the active forms of the integrins and trigger signaling cascades that alter numerous cell functions. Here we found that the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA), a key virulence factor of the whooping cough agent <i>Bordetella pertussis,</i> preferentially binds an inactive form of the integrin complement receptor 3 (CR3), using a site outside of its I-domain. CyaA binding did not trigger downstream signaling of CR3 in human monocytes and CyaA-catalyzed elevation of cAMP effectively blocked CR3 signaling initiated by a natural ligand. This unprecedented type of integrin-ligand interaction distinguishes CyaA from all other known ligands of the I-domain-containing integrins and provides a mechanistic insight into the previously observed central role of CyaA in the pathogenesis of <i>B. pertussis</i>."

                        "text": "Integrins are dimeric transmembrane proteins complexes composed of an alpha and a beta subunit. There are 18 different alpha subunits and 8 beta subunits that combine in a limited number of combinations of which 24 are currently known in mammals (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tan, 2012</a>). Integrins are essential for regulation of numerous cellular functions including cell signaling and adhesion. Nine of the eighteen integrin alpha subunits harbor a conserved I (inserted)-domain that is crucial for binding of endogenous ligands (<a href=\"#bib35\">Johnson and Chouhan, 2014</a>). Four of these integrin alpha subunits (\u03b1<sub>D</sub>, \u03b1<sub>L</sub>, \u03b1<sub>M</sub> and \u03b1<sub>X</sub>) form heterodimers exclusively with the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> subunit, thus forming the \u03b1<sub>D</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub> (CD11d/CD18), \u03b1<sub>L</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub> (CD11a/CD18, LFA-1), \u03b1<sub>M</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub> (CD11b/CD18, complement receptor 3 (CR3), Mac1) and \u03b1<sub>X</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub> (CD11c/CD18, CR4, p150/195) integrins, respectively (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arnaout, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mazzone and Ricevuti, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sanchez-Madrid, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Van der Vieren et al., 1995</a>). The \u03b2<sub>2</sub> integrins have specialized roles in immune and inflammatory responses and, like other integrins, employ a two-step mechanism of bi-directional signal transmission between the interior of cells and the extracellular milieu (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anthis and Campbell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tan, 2012</a>). Upon activation by various intracellular signals, the inside-out signaling is initiated through rearrangement of the integrin molecule from an inactive (bent, closed, resting, low-affinity) conformation to an active (extended, open, high-affinity) conformation. Subsequent ligand binding triggers outside-in signaling of the extended integrins through activation of Src family tyrosine kinases (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jakus et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00f3csai et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schymeinsky et al., 2007</a>). Src kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), on the cytoplasmic face of ITAM-containing transmembrane adaptor proteins, such as DAP12 or the FcR \u03b3-chain (FcR\u03b3) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jakus et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">M\u00f3csai et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schymeinsky et al., 2007</a>). These serve as docking sites for the tandem phosphotyrosine-binding Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the non-receptor spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jakus et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">M\u00f3csai et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schymeinsky et al., 2007</a>). Recruitment and activation of Syk then leads to assembly of a multi-protein signaling complex that contains cytosolic Syk-binding molecules and initiates further downstream signaling, ultimately triggering various cellular responses that play a central role in the innate immune defense to infection (<a href=\"#bib50\">M\u00f3csai et al., 2010</a>)."

Furthermore, we show that CyaA-catalyzed elevation of cAMP effectively blocked the iC3b opsonin-elicited activation of the CR3-Syk signaling pathway in human monocytes."

                                "text": "It was previously shown that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human CR3 can be used as a suitable model for studying the interaction of CyaA with CR3 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guermonprez et al., 2001</a>). Indeed, CR3 (CD11b/CD18) expressed by CHO cells allowed the binding and cAMP-elevating (cytotoxic) activities of CyaA, while the highly homologous CR4 (CD11c/CD18) was unable to bind CyaA despite sharing the same \u03b2<sub>2</sub> (CD18) subunit with CR3 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guermonprez et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, to delineate the CyaA binding site(s) on CR3, we performed swapping of the homologous alpha chain segments (CD11b and CD11c) of CR3 and CR4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). First, a CHO cell line stably expressing the CD18 subunit (CHO-CD18) was established (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This was next used for generating stable cell lines that expressed similar quantities of intact CD11b (CHO-CD11b/CD18), CD11c (CHO-CD11c/CD18), or of the chimeric CD11b-CD11c heterodimeric complexes on the cell surface (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The capacity of such cells to bind CyaA was then assessed by flow cytometry and the susceptibility to CyaA penetration and enzymatic intoxication by the delivered AC domain of the toxin was measured as intracellular accumulation of cAMP. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, replacement of the segment containing residues 614 to 682 (segment 614-682) of CD11b by the corresponding portion of CD11c caused a sharp, about ten-fold decrease of CyaA binding to the CHO-CD11b<sub>614-682c</sub>/CD18 transfectants, as compared to cells expressing intact CR3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This resulted in accordingly reduced toxin penetration and cAMP accumulation in cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). CyaA binding was also partially reduced on cells expressing CR3 chimeras having the residues 33 to 115 (72 \u00b1 6%), 342 to 424 (61 \u00b1 10%), or 686 to 1152 (89 \u00b1 11%) of CD11b replaced by the corresponding segments of CD11c, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). No reduction of CyaA binding was observed on cells expressing the remaining CD11b-CD11c/CD18 chimeras (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which all accumulated comparable levels of cAMP as the cells expressing intact CR3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Surprisingly, CyaA binding and subsequent intoxication of cells by cAMP were neither reduced by swapping of the homologous I-domain regions between CD11b and CD11c (CD11b<sub>120-272c</sub> and CD11b<sub>275-339c</sub>), nor upon removal of the entire I-domain of CD11b (CD11b<sub>\u0394164-339</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). This demonstrates that CyaA does not bind CR3 through the I-domain and rather recognizes the segment containing residues 614 to 682 that encompasses the C-terminal end of the last repeat of the \u03b2-propeller domain and the N-terminal portion of the thigh domain of CD11b. This finding is consistent with the sequence alignment by the Jotun Hein method (Lasergene software, DNASTAR) showing that the 614-682 segments of CD11b and CD11c are only 41% identical at the amino acid level, compared to the entire CD11b and CD11c subunits that exhibit an overall 61% sequence identity. Since, however, some other segments of CD11b appeared to be important for full toxin binding to CR3 as well, these results suggest that CyaA likely binds the integrin through a multivalent interaction, making contacts with several integrin segments. Moreover, CyaA bound CD11b only when this was associated with CD18 and not when the CD11b subunit was expressed alone on the surface of CHO-CD11b cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

This allowed cytometric selection of stably transfected CHO clones expressing similar quantities of the integrins on the cell surface (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, the CD11c<sub>614-682b</sub>-YFP/CD18 chimera bound different concentrations of CyaA with substantially higher efficacy (on average 24-fold higher) than the intact CD11c-YFP/CD18 complex and the chimera exhibited only a slightly lower efficacy of toxin binding (on average 1.7-fold lower) than the CD11b-YFP/CD18 integrin itself (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

First, the known 3D structure of the homologous CR4 integrin (<a href=\"#bib82\">Xie et al., 2010</a>) was used as a template for construction of a homology model of the 3D structure of CR3. In parallel, the structure of the CR3 binding site located within residues 1166 to 1287 (segment 1166-1287) of CyaA (<a href=\"#bib19\">El-Azami-El-Idrissi et al., 2003</a>) was predicted <i>ab initio</i>, using I-TASSER (<a href=\"#bib60\">Roy et al., 2010</a>). Flexible side chain docking of CR3 and of the segment 1166-1287 of CyaA by the ClusPro server (<a href=\"#bib12\">Comeau et al., 2007</a>) was next used to predict the most probable interacting residues of the two proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Second, the \u03b1 subunits of all four \u03b2<sub>2</sub> integrins were aligned by the Jotun Hein method (Lasergene software, DNASTAR) and residues that are present at a given position only in the 614-682 segment of CD11b were considered as potentially involved in CyaA binding. Finally, the theoretical isoelectric points of the interacting segments (3.76 for 1166-1287 segment of CyaA and 8.27 for 614-682 segment of CD11b) were taken into account. The sum of these considerations suggested that the negatively charged residues of the 1166-1287 segment of CyaA might be involved in the interaction with positively charged residues within the 614-682 segment of CD11b."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>, the CyaA<sub>D1193A+D1194A+E1195A</sub> and CyaA<sub>E1232+D1234A</sub> constructs exhibited a strongly reduced capacity to bind and penetrate CR3-expessing CHO cells. Further, combinations of alanine substitutions were also introduced in place of charged and hydrophilic residues within the 614-682 segment of CD11b and six mutant CD11b molecules were stably expressed on the surface of CHO-CD18 cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). No statistically significant drop of CyaA binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and cAMP elevation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) was observed in the cells expressing CR3 variants with the combinations of substitutions R619A+K621A, E625A+N627A+R629A, K644A+K646A, or E650A+R652A within the 614-682 segment of CD11b, respectively. In contrast, alanine substitutions of the three positively charged arginine residues at positions 662, 664 and 666 of CD11b almost completely abolished binding of CyaA to the CR3 mutant variant and a significant reduction of CyaA binding was also observed with cells expressing the CD11b<sub>K659+T661A</sub>/CD18 construct (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, this loss or reduction of CyaA binding was not due to an alteration of the structure of the CyaA binding site within the mutant integrins, as these bound the CyaA-blocking mAbs MEM-174, OKM1 and VIM12 to the same extent as the intact CR3. The only exception was the CyaA-blocking mAb M1/70, which exhibited reduced binding to both mutant integrins, similarly as CyaA. This indicates that the M1/70 mAb and CyaA may recognize the same epitope within the 614-682 segment of CD11b. In comparison to CHO cells expressing intact CR3, CyaA produced importantly lower intracellular cAMP levels in cells expressing CD11b<sub>R662A+R664A+R666A</sub>/CD18 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Taken together, our mutagenesis experiments confirmed the computational predictions and identified the residues involved in CD11b recognition by CyaA."

For this experiment, a leukocyte-enriched fraction was isolated from fresh human blood and treated (or not) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) that is a known agonist activating CR3 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diamond and Springer, 1993</a>). The cells were subsequently stained with mAbs and exposed to different concentrations of CyaA, before being analyzed by flow cytometry. Monocytes were gated based on light-scatter characteristics and expression of CD14 and used for assessment of CyaA binding. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>, PMA-stimulated monocytes expressed the same amounts of CR3 as untreated monocytes (detected with OKM1 mAb), but bound the toxin with a significantly lower efficiency. This was clearly due to conformational rearrangement of CR3 on PMA-activated monocytes, as the activated cells bound approximately two-fold more of\u00a0the\u00a0activation-reporting mAb MEM-148 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Drbal et al., 2001</a>) than the non-activated monocytes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The monocytes pretreated with PMA then accumulated substantially lower intracellular levels of cAMP upon exposure to CyaA than the non-activated cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Similarly, activation of CR3 by pretreatment of cells with Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altieri, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2013</a>) reduced toxin binding and cAMP accumulation in monocytes (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This demonstrates that the bent CR3 conformer bound the toxin with a higher affinity than the extended conformer, confirming the data obtained by binding experiments on PMA- or Mn<sup>2+</sup>-activated primary monocytes."

This initiates downstream signaling and provokes multiple cellular activation responses, including complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis of bacteria (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shi et al., 2006</a>). We hence examined if the I-domain-independent interaction of CyaA with CR3 activates Syk in human monocytic cells. THP-1 monocytes, which bind CyaA in a CR3-dependent and saturable manner (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), were exposed to different concentrations of CyaA over a range of incubation times. Phosphorylated Syk was next immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb and was detected by anti-Syk mAb in immunoblots. As a positive control, the CR3-Syk signaling pathway was activated by iC3b-opsonized zymosan particles (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shi et al., 2006</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, Syk phosphorylation on tyrosine residues was observed after 30 min of incubation of THP-1 cells with iC3b-opsonized zymosan. No phosphorylation of Syk was, however, detected following exposure of THP-1 cells for up to 60 min to 30 ng/ml CyaA, a concentration close to physiological toxin levels (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eby et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, Syk activation was not observed when THP-1 cells were incubated with the enzymatically inactive CyaA-AC<sup>-</sup> toxoid (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Neither was Syk phosphorylation triggered by THP-1 cell exposure to concentrations of up to 3 \u00b5g/ml of active CyaA toxin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), or of its CyaA-AC<sup>-</sup> toxoid (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) for 15 or 30 min, respectively. Hence, in contrast to iC3b, which binds through the I-domain of CR3 and triggers activation of Syk (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shi et al., 2006</a>), the I-domain-independent mode of CyaA binding did not trigger any CR3 signaling through Syk pathway activation."

Moreover, the impairment of Syk phosphorylation upon CyaA treatment was not due to decreased cell viability (<a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). It can, hence, be concluded that Syk inactivation was due to signaling of the cAMP produced in cells by the penetrating CyaA toxin. Similar results were obtained when the same experiments were performed with primary human monocytes isolated from leukopacks of healthy donors (<a href=\"#fig7s6\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Taken together, our data show that the cAMP signaling of CyaA decreases the capacity of CR3 to bind the iC3b opsonin, prevents activation of Syk by iC3b-engaged CR3 and inactivates also Syk that has already been activated by iC3b/CR3."

CyaA preferentially binds the integrin in a non-activated (bent, low-affinity) conformation and engagement of CR3 by CyaA does not trigger Syk activation in monocytes. Moreover, CyaA-catalyzed elevation of cAMP effectively blocks the iC3b opsonin-elicited activation of CR3-Syk signaling in monocytes. It remains to be elucidated how CyaA-produced cAMP signaling suppresses Syk activity. Binding outside of the I-domain in an activation-independent mode thus enables the toxin to hijack CR3 and block its signaling, thereby enabling <i>B. pertussis</i> to evade CR3-mediated phagocytosis."

The \u03b2-propeller domain consist of seven \u03b2-sheet repeats (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) that are arranged in a torus, or propeller, with each \u03b2-sheet representing one blade of the propeller (<a href=\"#bib55\">Oxvig and Springer, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Springer, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Xie et al., 2010</a>). Its fold is most closely related to the \u03b2 subunit of the trimeric G-protein (<a href=\"#bib67\">Springer, 1997</a>) and proper folding of the \u03b2-propeller requires association of the \u03b1 subunit with the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> subunit (<a href=\"#bib31\">Huang and Springer, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lu et al., 1998</a>).

The structural rearrangement at the thigh/genu interface is involved in the activation-dependent extension of the integrin \u03b1 subunit (<a href=\"#bib81\">Xie et al., 2004</a>). It was previously suggested that the \u03b2-propeller/thigh region segment of CD11b (residues 599 to 679), comprising the principal CyaA binding site, can fold also in the absence of the CD18 subunit, since it was recognized by the OKM1 mAb when the CD11b subunit was expressed alone on COS cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lu et al., 1998</a>). Indeed, we observed here that OKM1 recognized CD11b that was expressed alone on CHO-CD11b cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). However, CyaA failed to bind any significantly to cells expressing the isolated CD11b subunit on their surface (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). In contrast to the OKM1 epitope, hence, the CyaA-binding site within the segment 614-682 of CD11b may acquire the correct structure (fold) only when the CD11b subunit is in complex with CD18. Alternatively, an interaction of CyaA with the CD18 subunit may also be involved in CyaA binding to CR3, even though CD18 alone was unable to bind CyaA on its own (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>)."

                        "text": "In addition, recognition of additional segments of CD11b appears to contribute to the full capacity of CR3 to bind CyaA. Engagement of these segments likely facilitates or stabilizes the higher-affinity interaction of CyaA with the principal binding site (residues 614 to 682). Toxin interactions at several sites on CD11b would then synergize in bringing about the highly selective interaction of CyaA with the CD11b subunit of CR3. Indeed, we have previously described that an initial low-affinity interaction of CyaA with N-linked glycan chains of the C-terminal part of the CD11b subunit is a critical prerequisite for toxin binding to CR3 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hasan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Morova et al., 2008</a>). A low-affinity interaction with abundant N-linked glycans on the integrin molecule most likely serves as the initial step of toxin pre-concentration from solution into the two-dimensional space of the cell surface. This increase of local CyaA concentration would then increase the probability of proper positioning of the toxin molecule for its subsequent high affinity interaction with specific amino acid residues of the CR3 glycoprotein. This two-step mode of CyaA-CR3 interaction is supported by the SPR binding curves which fit well using the bivalent analyte model, describing a two-step association process. Compared to a mechanism of direct single step binding from solution, a sequential binding mechanism would, indeed, lower the affinity constraints on interaction of CyaA with the ectodomain of CR3. The stability of the CyaA-CR3 complex may then be further increased by an irreversible insertion of the hydrophobic domain and of the acyl chains of CyaA into the cellular membrane, which most likely accounts for the observed high apparent affinity of toxin binding to CR3-expressing cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guermonprez et al., 2001</a>)."

However, this is at odds with the initial observation of Guermonprez and co-workers that CyaA does selectively and with high affinity bind the dendritic cells and macrophages expressing CD11b/CD18, whereas B and T cell lines expressing exclusively the LFA-1 complex were recognized with substantially lower efficacy, if at all (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guermonprez et al., 2001</a>). To rule out that this difference in CyaA binding was due to unequal expression levels of the integrins on various cell types, we added a fluorescent YFP tag to the C-terminus of the CD11a subunit and generated a cell line (CHO-CD11a-YFP/CD18) expressing the same quantities of the integrin molecules on the cell surface as found on the CR3-expressing cell line (CHO-CD11b-YFP/CD18) (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, over a range of CyaA concentrations, the CHO-CD11a-YFP/CD18 cells bound about two orders of magnitude less CyaA toxin than the CD11b-YFP/CD18-expressing cells. Moreover, the difference in binding of CyaA to CD11a-YFP/CD18-expressing cells, CD11c-YFP/CD18-expressing cells, or the mock-transfected cells expressing no \u03b2<sub>2</sub> integrin at all, was not statistically significant (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). To exclude the concern that the residual binding of CyaA to CD11a-YFP/CD18 could be due to the presence of the YFP tag, we generated a cell line expressing comparable amounts of intact CD11a/CD18 (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and demonstrated that CyaA binds these cells as poorly as cells expressing CD11a-YFP/CD18 with the YFP tag (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In addition, we purified the intact LFA-1 integrin from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by immunoaffinity chromatography on MEM-25 mAb-Sepharose beads and immobilized it onto an SPR sensor chip. Real-time SPR measurements revealed no CyaA\u2206H binding to the intact LFA-1 (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; cf. CyaA\u2206H binding to CR3 in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>). Finally, cells expressing CD11a-YFP/CD18 were intoxicated by CyaA to equally low cAMP levels as the control cells expressing CD11c-YFP/CD18, or lacking any \u03b2<sub>2</sub> integrin, while cAMP intoxication of cells expressing CD11b-YFP/CD18 was over two orders of magnitude higher than that of the control cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). All these data clearly demonstrate that CyaA binds and intoxicates cells expressing LFA-1 with equally low efficacy as cells expressing CR4, or lacking any \u03b2<sub>2</sub> integrin at all."

The Syk tyrosine kinase pathway, pinpointed here as the target of CyaA action, plays a central role in both FcR- and CR3-mediated phagocytosis, as it is activated immediately upon binding of immunoglobulin or iC3b opsonins to the respective FcR and CR3 receptors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crowley et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kiefer et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shi et al., 2006</a>). We show that CyaA bypasses the Syk-activating interaction with CR3 through a subversive preferential recognition of its bent, resting conformation and by engaging the CR3 structures outside of the I-domain of CD11b. In contrast to iC3b opsonin, binding of CyaA, or of its non-enzymatic CyaA-AC<sup>-</sup> toxoid, did not trigger any CR3-mediated activation of Syk. Strikingly, CyaA-catalyzed elevation of cAMP in phagocytes effectively blocked subsequent activation of Syk through iC3b binding to CR3. Most importantly, when Syk was pre-activated by incubation of phagocytes with iC3b, the subsequent CR3-dependent invasion of CyaA into cells enabled cAMP signaling-mediated inactivation of Syk (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

The first would be based on the observation that increased cAMP levels activate the inhibitory C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA (<a href=\"#bib74\">Vang et al., 2001</a>). Csk may then directly inactivate the Src kinases by phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib74\">Vang et al., 2001</a>). Inactive Src kinases would then be unable to accomplish the double phosphorylation of the ITAM-containing adaptor, which is a prerequisite for recruitment and activation of Syk (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jakus et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00f3csai et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schymeinsky et al., 2007</a>). A second plausible mechanism would be based on our recent observation that CyaA/cAMP-mediated signaling triggers activation of the ubiquitously expressed SH2-containing non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (PTPN6) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cerny et al., 2015</a>).

This underpins the crucial role played by the CyaA toxin in the early stages of host colonization by <i>B. pertussis</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Goodwin and Weiss, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Khelef et al., 1992</a>). It further indicates that vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody response against CyaA is likely to be importantly contributing to protection against infection and colonization by <i>B. pertussis</i>. Absence of the CyaA antigen from current acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines is thus of concern (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sebo et al., 2014</a>).

For staining of integrin molecules on cell surface by mAbs, 2x10<sup>5</sup> transfected CHO cells were incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in 50 \u00b5l of cHBSS buffer containing mAbs diluted according to manufacturer\u00b4s instructions. For CyaA binding assay, 2x10<sup>5</sup> transfected CHO cells were incubated in 100 \u00b5l of cHBSS buffer containing 2 \u00b5g/ml of CyaA-biotin (the concentration giving approximately a half-maximal binding of the toxin to CHO cells expressing intact CR3) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The surface-bound CyaA-biotin was stained with streptavidin-PE (diluted 1:400; eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. After washing, cells were resuspended in HBSS and analyzed by flow cytometry in the presence of 1 \u00b5g/ml of propidium iodide, or Hoechst 33258. Data were analyzed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) and appropriate gatings were used to exclude cell aggregates and dead cells.

The freshly separated bent and extended conformers of the sCR3 ectodomain and the freshly purified LFA-1 integrin were diluted to concentrations of 1\u201320 \u00b5g/ml in 10 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and immobilized on a GLC chip using a ProteOn amine coupling kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at a flow rate of 30 \u00b5l/min. Non-reacted activated groups were blocked by the injection of 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5). The subsequent SPR measurements were carried out in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.005% Tween 20 at a flow rate of 100 \u00b5l/min for both the association and the dissociation phase of the sensograms. To minimize non-specific binding and mass transfer effects, three coupling concentrations of each sCR3 conformer (leading to refractive index changes of 400, 800 and 1200 RU) were tested. Initial experiments at each of the sCR3 coating concentrations were conducted with CyaA\u2206H at concentrations ranging from 20 to 320 \u00b5g/ml. The initial estimates of k<sub>off</sub> values then showed a concentration independence at all coupling levels, indicating that artifacts from analyte rebinding and mass transfer effects could be ruled out. Consequently, a coupling level of 1200 RU and flow rate of 100 \u00b5l/ml was chosen for all remaining experiments."

The data were analyzed by global fitting of the response curves using a 1:1 Langmuir binding kinetics and a bivalent analyte model to determine the kinetic association and dissociation rate constants.

Moreover, they suggest that CyaA binding site is not in the \u03b1I (\u03b1A) domain. The exact significance of CyaA binding to cellular receptors is not clear (Its internalization is supposed to take place directly through plasma membrane, not via endocytosis, see Landant and Ullmann, 1999), but the observations are still interesting for integrin biology, since very little is known about the putative atypical ligand binding sites and mechanisms. Still, ligand binding to the bent integrin conformation is not entirely new idea, since non-activated integrins may participate e.g. in leukocyte rolling and human echovirus-1 binds to the non-activated \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin."

The 3D structure modeling-coupled to mutagenesis followed by functional analysis allow the authors to identify in CyaA a group of negatively charged amino-acids implicated in this interaction and a group of positively charged amino-acids in their vicinity in CD11b. This convincingly points for the importance of electrostatic interactions in the interaction of the toxin with its receptor. They also established that CyaA binds preferentially to the close conformation / inactive form of the integrin.

However, due to the complex and multivalent nature of CyaA interaction with CR3, such experiments are not likely to yield conclusive results. In contrast to binding of some endogenous ligands to the isolated recombinant I-domain of CR3 (Zhou et al., JBC, 1994), CyaA appears to recognize in a first step the presence of N-linked glycan chains of the C-terminal part of CD11b (Hasan et al. 2015), which is a critical prerequisite for toxin binding to CR3 (Morova et al. 2008). However, no N-glycan chains necessary for CyaA binding appear to be present within the segment 614-682 (Hasan et al. 2015). Moreover, as discussed in the manuscript and above, recognition of several segments of CD11b appears to contribute to the full capacity of CR3 to bind CyaA. Engagement of these segments likely facilitates or stabilizes the higher-affinity interaction of CyaA with the principal binding site located within the segment 614 to 682. Further, as now documented in the newly added <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, CyaA recognizes the CD11b subunit only when this is in the heterodimeric complex with CD18. This strongly suggests that proper folding of the CD11b segment on the scaffold of the CD18 subunit is essential for toxin binding. This may explain why we failed to observe any significant inhibition of CyaA binding to the CD11b/CD18 heterodimer in the presence of a synthetic peptide derived from the 614-682 segment of CD11b (data not shown). Therefore, we opted here for a 'transplantation' experiment yielding positive evidence, where the 614-682 segment of CD11b was swapped into the context of the CD11c subunit of CR4 and conferred on CR4 a substantial capacity to bind CyaA and support toxin penetration into cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We consider this as providing convincing evidence that the segment 614-682 is the principal binding site of CyaA. This conclusion is then strongly supported by loss of CyaA binding (i) upon swapping of the corresponding segment 614-682 of CD11c into CD11b (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>); (ii) in the presence of mAbs competing with the toxin for the same segment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and (iii) upon site-directed mutagenesis of the segment 614-682 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), respectively."

A better experiment would have been to use mutant integrins (e.g. E320A in \u03b1<sub>M</sub>) that favour the bent conformation together with integrins harbouring a gain-of-function mutation.

Does native \u03b1<sub>L</sub> support CyaA entry in these assays?</i>Already Guermonprez et al. 2001 have unambiguously demonstrated that CyaA binds selectively and with high affinity the cells expressing CR3, such as the dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas B and T cells, which express only the LFA-1 complex, are recognized by CyaA with very low efficacy, like other cells lacking CR3 and \u03b2<sub>2</sub>integrins, such as erythrocytes. Guermonprez et al. summarized their observations as follows: \u201cThe lack of efficient binding to CD11c/CD18 transfectants, or CD11a/CD18 expressing cells such as EL4 or LB27.4, also suggests that CD11b/CD18 is the only integrin of the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> family involved in the binding of CyaA to the target cells\u201d. We have fully reproduced here the findings of Guermonprez et al. 2001, showing that cells expressing LFA-1 bound about two orders of magnitude less CyaA toxin than cells expressing the same quantities of CR3, when the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>integrin expression level per cell was calibrated by using the YFP tag C-terminally fused to either of the alpha integrin subunits (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in the levels of CyaA binding to cells expressing high amounts of CD11a-YFP/CD18, of CD11c-YFP/CD18, or not expressing any \u03b2<sub>2</sub> integrin at all (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, CyaA binding to cells expressing CD11c-YFP/CD18 was newly added to the figure). This was not surprising, since CyaA has a well-documented capacity to bind and penetrate with a low efficacy the plasma membrane of all cell types lacking CR3 (reviewed in Vojtova et al. 2006; Ladant et al., Trends Microbiol, 1999; Hanski et al., Trends Biochem Sci, 1989)."

In addition, we purified the intact LFA-1 integrin from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by immunoaffinity chromatography and immobilized it onto an SPR sensor chip. Real-time SPR measurements revealed that CyaA fails to bind the immobilized LFA-1 (added as <a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Moreover, cells expressing LFA-1 were intoxicated by CyaA to equally low cAMP levels as the control cells expressing CR4, or lacking any \u03b2<sub>2</sub> integrin. Indeed, cAMP intoxication levels of cells expressing CR3 were over two orders of magnitude higher than those of the control cells (added as <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, panel B). This is in agreement with previously published data showing that a concentration of 5 ng/ml of CyaA was sufficient to produce 6 pmol of cAMP per 1 million of human THP-1 monocytes expressing CR3 (Ahmad et al., Cell Microbiol, 2015), while ~1600-times higher concentration of CyaA (8 \u03bcg/ml) had to be used to yield ~2 pmol of cAMP per 1 million of human blood T-cells or Jurkat T lymphoma cells expressing LFA-1 (Paccani et al. 2011). Moreover, LFA1-expressing Jurkat cells were previously found to bind CyaA as inefficiently as sheep erythrocytes that lack any \u03b2<sub>2</sub> integrin (Gray et al., Infect Immun, 1999). Numerous in vitro studies previously reported that CyaA can penetrate a wide variety of cells lacking any \u03b2<sub>2</sub> integrin, which is simply due to the extremely high specific AC enzyme activity. At &gt;100 ng/ml concentration, the toxin causes easily detectable increase of intracellular cAMP concentrations over time in essentially any cell type (reviewed in Vojtova et al., Curr Opin Microbiol, 2006; Ladant et al., Trends Microbiol, 1999; Hanski et al., Trends Biochem Sci, 1989)."
