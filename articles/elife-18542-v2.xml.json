However, endothelial-dependent mechanisms of myeloid cell recruitment are not fully understood. Here we show using an autoperfused flow chamber assay of whole blood neutrophils and intravital microscopy of the inflamed cremaster muscle that CD95 mediates leukocyte slow rolling, adhesion and transmigration upon binding of CD95-ligand (CD95L) that is presented by endothelial cells. In myeloid cells, CD95 triggers activation of Syk-Btk/PLC\u03b32/Rap1 signaling that ultimately leads to integrin activation. Excitingly, CD95-deficient myeloid cells exhibit impaired bacterial clearance in an animal model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Our data identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the chemoattractant effect of endothelial cell-derived CD95L in induction of neutrophil recruitment and support the use of therapeutic inhibition of CD95\u2019s activity in inflammatory diseases."

Experiments performed on mouse cells and tissues showed that the cells that line the blood vessels present the CD95 ligand on their surfaces in order to activate CD95 in the neutrophils circulating in the bloodstream. This ultimately leads to neutrophil slow rolling and adhesion. Further experiments in mice showed that this ability of CD95 to recruit neutrophils to inflamed sites was crucial for clearing bacteria in cases of sepsis, where infection causes the immune system to damage the body\u2019s own tissues."

Slow rolling and firm adhesion are mediated by selectin- and chemokine-induced integrin signaling. Selectin is expressed and presented to the vessel lumen by inflamed endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zarbock et al., 2011</a>). E-selectin engagement with PSGL-1 and CD44 ligands induces activation of the Src family kinases (SFKs) Hck, Fgr and Lyn (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yago et al., 2010</a>) which then phosphorylate and activate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing adaptor protein Fc receptor common \u03b3 signaling chain (FcR\u03b3) and DNAX activation protein of 12\u2009kDa (DAP12) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zarbock et al., 2008</a>). These activated adaptor proteins recruit and phosphorylate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which in turn activates Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mueller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yago et al., 2010</a>). Btk further activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C \u03b32 (PLC\u03b32) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways that mediate the integrin signaling to induce slow rolling."

In CD95L-stimulated myeloid cells, we identified Lyn as the major SFK that phosphorylates CD95\u2019s tyrosine, thereby allowing recruitment of Syk, which via the PI3K/MMP9 pathway results in myeloid cell migration to the inflammatory site (<a href=\"#bib28\">Letellier et al., 2010</a>). However, the roles of CD95 in the initial cellular processes of myeloid cell recruitment, such as rolling and adhesion, remain unknown."

Interestingly, in T cells the apoptotic cascade is prevented via formation of CD44-ezrin-actin-CD95 signaling complexes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mielgo et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2007</a>). Likewise, in B cells the CD95-FADD interaction is prevented by binding of Btk to CD95 via its kinase and Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (<a href=\"#bib60\">Uckun, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Vassilev et al., 1999</a>).

CD95 in myeloid cells or CD95L in endothelial cells is required for myeloid cell recruitment in in vivo animal models of inflammation. Further, deletion of CD95 in myeloid cells impairs bacterial clearance in systemic inflammation.

                                "text": "In order to study the role of CD95 in leukocyte slow rolling we used a mouse autoperfused flow chamber assay (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chesnutt et al., 2006</a>). This assay has the advantage of allowing examination of rolling and adhesion of neutrophils from whole blood, thereby preventing isolation-induced activation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Forsyth and Levinsky, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Glasser and\u00a0Fiederlein, 1990</a>). In addition, using the <i>Lyz2<sup>&lt;CreGFP&gt;</sup> </i>reporter mice, 89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% of the rolling cells in the flow chamber have been identified as neutrophils (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chesnutt et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with previous reports, the rolling velocity of neutrophils is significantly reduced on E-selectin+ICAM1-coated chamber as compared to the E-selectin-coated chamber (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jung and Ley, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chesnutt et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zarbock et al., 2007</a>). Additional intravenous tail (i.v.) injection of CD95L one hour prior to flow chamber assay significantly reduced the rolling velocity as compared to control counterparts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>; 1.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0\u00b5m/s vs. 1.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0\u00b5m/s). In order to exclude the possibility that CD95 mediates neutrophil slow rolling via the CD95-induced chemokine production, which has been reported in various cell types (<a href=\"#bib44\">Park et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Guo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Altemeier et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Miwa et al., 1998</a>), mouse blood was perfused through the flow chambers coated with E-selectin, ICAM1 and CD95L. The rolling velocity of neutrophils in 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml CD95L-coated chamber was significantly lower than in the control group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>; 1.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0\u00b5m/s vs. 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0\u00b5m/s). Flow chamber coated with 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml CD95L showed the strongest effect on slow rolling as compared to other coating concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Rolling cells in CD95L alone-coated or CD95L/ICAM1-coated chamber were not detectable which indicated that CD95L-induced slow rolling was E-selectin-dependent (data not shown). In addition, CD95L i.v. injection or CD95L-coating increased the number of rolling cells in the flow chamber as compared to the control group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To further confirm that the CD95L-induced neutrophil slow rolling was specific to CD95, we specifically deleted CD95 in myeloid cells (<i>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></i>). Although CD95-deficient neutrophils rolled at a similar velocity as <i>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup></i>neutrophils (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), CD95L i.v.-injection or CD95L coating failed to reduce neutrophils\u2019 rolling velocity in <i>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Interestingly, <i>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></i> mice showed significantly less rolling cells in CD95L-coated flow chamber or upon CD95L injection as compared to the <i>WT</i> mice under the same condition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Control experiments demonstrated that <i>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></i> mice exhibited less rolling cells in a\u00a0flow chamber coated with E-selectin and ICAM1 than <i>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup></i>mice, however this was not significant (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These results imply that CD95 might be important for the arrest of neutrophils."

In this study, we show that in the autoperfused flow chamber assay immobilized CD95L promotes the slow rolling of neutrophils in an integrin signaling-dependent pathway. Hence, we hypothesized that in vivo activated endothelial cells present CD95L to facilitate neutrophil recruitment. In order to address this hypothesis, we crossed <i>Cdh5<sup>&lt;CreERT2&gt;</sup> </i>mice with <i>Fasl<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup></i> mice to enable inducible deletion of CD95L in endothelial cells by tamoxifen treatment (<i>Fasl<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Cdh5<sup>&lt;CreERT2&gt;</sup></i>) and performed the intravital microscopy experiments as we did with <i>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

                                "text": "E-selectin engagement triggers a signaling cascade which cooperates with chemokine signals to facilitate neutrophil rolling and adhesion during inflammation (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zarbock et al., 2007</a>). E-selectin is expressed by inflamed endothelial cells and engages PSGL-1, CD44 and other ligands in neutrophils (<a href=\"#bib67\">Xia et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Katayama et al., 2005</a>). Upon ligand engagement, it has been reported that E-selectin activates SFKs which in turn initiate a signaling pathway involving the activation of ITAM bearing adaptors, Syk, Btk, PLC\u03b32, P38 and PI3K\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yago et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mueller et al., 2010</a>). We have previously shown that CD95L triggers the recruitment of myeloid cells to inflammatory sites via SFK-Syk-PI3K pathway (<a href=\"#bib28\">Letellier et al., 2010</a>). To validate whether CD95 signaling can also activate Btk and PLC\u03b32 via Syk, we studied Btk and PLC\u03b32 activation upon CD95L stimulation. As <i>Syk</i> deficiency (<i>Syk-/-</i>) is perinatal-lethal in mice (<a href=\"#bib59\">Turner et al., 1995</a>), we cultured primary embryonic liver-derived macrophages. Activation of CD95 increased phosphorylation of Syk, Btk and PLC\u03b32 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and quantified analysis in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). CD95-mediated phosphorylation of PLC\u03b32 greatly decreased in macrophages isolated from <i>Syk-/-</i> mice as compared to wild type (<i>WT</i>) cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). The reduced basal level of p-PLC\u03b32 in <i>Syk-/-</i> cells indicates that Syk is not only involved in CD95L-mediated phosphorylation of PLC\u03b32 but also acts as a hub for other ligands. However, the upregulated phosphorylation of Btk was still present in <i>Syk-/-</i> as compared to <i>WT</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Activation of Btk could be explained by the previously observed interaction of the PH domain of Btk with CD95 in B-cells (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vassilev et al., 1999</a>). To examine this interaction we pulled down Btk from the lysates of CD95L-treated macrophages by immunoprecipitation. Binding of CD95 to Btk was detected following CD95L stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In order to validate the functional involvement of Btk in CD95L-induced PLC\u03b32 phosphorylation, we used the Btk inhibitor PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) 1\u2009hr prior to CD95L stimulation of macrophages. PCI-32765 fully blocked the basal and CD95-induced phosphorylation of Btk and PLC\u03b32 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F,G</a>), but not the phosphorylation of Syk (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), which indicates that the phosphorylation of PLC\u03b32 is Btk-dependent and that Btk is an essential mediator for CD95-induced PLC\u03b32 activation. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of two signaling branches downstream of CD95: CD95/SFK/Syk/Btk/PLC\u03b32 and CD95/SFK/Btk/PLC\u03b32 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). More importantly, immobilized CD95L-induced slow rolling was abolished in PCI-32765 pretreated mice in the autoperfused flow chamber assay, implying that CD95L-induced slow rolling was Btk-dependent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>)."

In these studies, transplantation of CD95L-overexpressing/CD95-negative tumor cells induced a dramatic neutrophil infiltration into the tumor xenografts. Other studies using Boyden chamber assays demonstrated that soluble CD95L induces the transmigration of human neutrophils in vitro (<a href=\"#bib55\">Seino et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ottonello et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dupont and Warrens, 2007</a>). Although these findings are interesting, they did not address whether CD95-induced neutrophil recruitment was through direct CD95 activation on neutrophils or secondary to CD95-induced production of inflammatory mediators. The present study shows that CD95 is involved in induction of slow rolling and adhesion of neutrophils, and that these steps are blocked in CD95-deficient neutrophils, indicating that CD95 induces slow rolling via a direct effect on neutrophils and not via induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines."

However, coating of the flow chamber with CD95L alone was not sufficient to induce leukocyte tethering (capturing), indicating that E-selectin is required for CD95-mediated slow rolling. It has been shown that selectin ligands PSGL-1 and CD44 are enriched in lipid rafts (<a href=\"#bib37\">Miner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Neame et al., 1995</a>). In addition, the three SFKs of neutrophils, Fgr, Hck, Lyn, which are activated upon the engagement of selectin to its ligands (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yago et al., 2010</a>), also associate with cholesterol-dependent membrane rafts (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lowell, 2004</a>). Interestingly, neutrophil slow rolling has been reported to be dependent on intact lipid microdomains to signal slow rolling on E-selectin and P-selectin (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yago et al., 2010</a>). The clustering of lipid microdomains is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chichili and Rodgers, 2007</a>). Ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins, which link the cytoskeleton to integral membrane proteins via their FERM domains, associate with PSGL-1 and CD44 through their cytoplasmic domains (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yonemura et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Urzainqui et al., 2002</a>). Moreover, ligation of PSGL-1 to selectin recruits Syk to an atypical ITAM on ERM proteins bound to the cytoplasmic domain of PSGL-1 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Urzainqui et al., 2002</a>). Thus, leukocyte rolling requires the formation of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane."

CD95 indirectly associates with actin via direct and specific binding to ezrin FERM domains (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lozupone et al., 2004</a>), and the organization of the microfilaments affects the outcome of CD95 stimulation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Parlato et al., 2000</a>).

The ITAM-like YXXL motif of CD95 is involved in the CD95-Lyn-Syk signaling cascade leading to myeloid cell transmigration (<a href=\"#bib28\">Letellier et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, the current study identifies an association of CD95 with integrin \u03b1<sub>L</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub> in neutrophils, as assessed by PLA, and macrophages, as confirmed by direct co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover, integrin activation reporter assay and the soluble ICAM1 binding assay demonstrate that CD95-induced integrin activation is a mechanism present in both macrophages and neutrophils.

Interestingly, CD95L has also shown to be expressed by endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sata and Walsh, 1998</a>). Overexpression of CD95L by adenovirus transduction in endothelial cells markedly attenuated TNF-\u03b1-induced T cell and macrophage infiltration, and adherent mononuclear cells underwent apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sata and Walsh, 1998</a>). Along this line, tumor endothelial cells selectively and highly express CD95L, which serves as a barrier to prevent the infiltration of CD8 cells via induction of apoptosis in the establishment of immune tolerance (<a href=\"#bib40\">Motz et al., 2014</a>). Contrary to the apoptotic effect of endothelial cell-derived CD95L, the present study shows that deletion of CD95L in endothelial cells impairs neutrophil recruitment in inflamed cremaster muscle and thioglycolate-induced peritonitis. Together, these data indicate that endothelial cell-derived CD95L may serve as a chemokine to induce myeloid cell recruitment during inflammation. Endothelial cells are known to basally express CD95L (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sata and Walsh, 1998</a>), however, as shown by our study on CD95L-induced slow rolling in the\u00a0autoperfused flow chamber assay, CD95L might only induce slow rolling in an inflammatory setting, as this function requires additional presentation of E-selectin by endothelial cells. In addition, inflammatory cytokines might increase CD95L levels in endothelial cells. Along this line, IFN\u03b3 activates CD95L promoter activity in T-cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kirchhoff et al., 2002</a>)."

However, all found major problems including 1) the need to address the state of CD95L in their system. Whether their soluble and surface-bound CD95L is monomeric or trimeric is not known and consequently, how it activates CD95 is not clear. While the full mechanism behind activation of integrins by CD95L2 need not be worked out in this paper, the details of their reagents must be provided in order to allow these experiments to be reproduced by others. 2) There are internal inconsistencies in the data, identified in the individual comments. These must be addressed. 3) The authors do not rule out other important modifiers or explanations such as the role of E-selectin. 4) It is not clear which (other) leukocyte integrins may be involved. After an online discussion, the reviewers thought that addressing these issues was necessary to validate their conclusions and therefore for acceptance of the manuscript. However, they thought that depending on the answers, additional experimentation to address these questions could be completed in a reasonable time frame if the authors chose to do so, and therefore, that they be given the opportunity to resubmit."

The authors show that presentation with CD95L results in phosphorylation of Syk/Btk/PLCy2/Rap1, an activation pathway that leads to integrin activation which in turn mediates slow rolling. Additionally, the authors show that CD95 in myeloid cells is required for bacterial clearance in a CLP-induced animal model of sepsis. The authors show a great deal of data collected through a thorough analysis of the effects of CD95L in vitro and in vivo. They determine that CD95L interaction results in activation of B2 integrin and subsequent decrease in rolling velocity and an increase in transendothelial migration that results in better bacterial clearance than in CD95-/- cells. However, the difference between CD95L signaling has not been decoupled from outside-in signaling induced by E-selectin engagement as the effect seems somewhat cooperative based on the data. Additionally, CD95L has often been associated with the induction of apoptosis and the authors must show that the cells are not moving towards an apoptotic phenotype when CD95 is engaged. All in all, the authors present a novel interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells that results in increased recruitment via outside-in signaling. With some additional experiments and verifications of cell lifetime the paper would make a strong addition to the literature."

The authors show that presentation with CD95L results in phosphorylation of Syk/Btk/PLCy2/Rap1, an activation pathway that leads to integrin activation which in turn mediates slow rolling. Additionally, the authors show that CD95 in myeloid cells is required for bacterial clearance in a CLP-induced animal model of sepsis. The authors show a great deal of data collected through a thorough analysis of the effects of CD95L</i> in vitro <i>and</i> in vivo<i>. They determine that CD95L interaction results in activation of B2 integrin and subsequent decrease in rolling velocity and an increase in transendothelial migration that results in better bacterial clearance than in CD95-/- cells. However, the difference between CD95L signaling has not been decoupled from outside-in signaling induced by E-selectin engagement as the effect seems somewhat cooperative based on the data. Additionally, CD95L has often been associated with the induction of apoptosis and the authors must show that the cells are not moving towards an apoptotic phenotype when CD95 is engaged. All in all, the authors present a novel interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells that results in increased recruitment via outside-in signaling. With some additional experiments and verifications of cell lifetime the paper would make a strong addition to the literature.</i> "
