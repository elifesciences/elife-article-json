                    "text": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease. Although many patients with asthma develop type-2 dominated eosinophilic inflammation, a number of individuals develop paucigranulocytic asthma, which occurs in the absence of eosinophilia or neutrophilia. The aetiology of paucigranulocytic asthma is unknown. However, both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and mutations in the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (<i>RAGE</i>) are risk factors for asthma development. Here, we show that RAGE deficiency impairs anti-viral immunity during an early-life infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; a murine analogue of RSV). The elevated viral load was associated with the release of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) which triggered airway smooth muscle remodelling in early-life. Re-infection with PVM in later-life induced many of the cardinal features of asthma in the absence of eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation. Anti-HMGB1 mitigated both early-life viral disease and asthma-like features, highlighting HMGB1 as a possible novel therapeutic target."

Although many patients with asthma develop type-2 dominated eosinophilic inflammation, a number of individuals develop paucigranulocytic asthma, which occurs in the absence of eosinophilia or neutrophilia. The aetiology of paucigranulocytic asthma is unknown. However, both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and mutations in the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (<i>RAGE</i>) are risk factors for asthma development. Here, we show that RAGE deficiency impairs anti-viral immunity during an early-life infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; a murine analogue of RSV). The elevated viral load was associated with the release of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) which triggered airway smooth muscle remodelling in early-life. Re-infection with PVM in later-life induced many of the cardinal features of asthma in the absence of eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation. Anti-HMGB1 mitigated both early-life viral disease and asthma-like features, highlighting HMGB1 as a possible novel therapeutic target."

The asthmatic airway is characterised by numerous structural changes (collectively referred to as \u2018airway remodelling\u2019) including increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass, sub-epithelial fibrosis and goblet cell hyperplasia/hypersecretion. Asthma is often considered to be driven by type-2 eosinophilic inflammation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lambrecht and Hammad, 2003</a>). However, approximately half of all patients with asthma do not exhibit eosinophilic inflammation, and accordingly, other asthma phenotypes have been described that include neutrophilic, mixed granulocytic and paucigranulocytic inflammatory phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Simpson et al., 2006</a>;<a href=\"#bib8\">Hinks et al., 2016</a>). Paucigranulocytic asthma occurs in the absence of pronounced eosinophilia or neutrophilia and in the few studies performed to date, is reported to affect between 32% and 52% of patients with asthma (<a href=\"#bib37\">Simpson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schleich et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Simpson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Porsbjerg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2011</a>).

Interestingly, O\u2019Reilly and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib24\">O'Reilly et al., 2013</a>) showed that wheezy preschool children displayed ASM remodelling prior to their diagnosis of asthma as school aged children. Wheeze in children is often associated with a lower respiratory tract infection, raising the possibility that paediatric viral infections contribute to airway remodelling in early life and the subsequent development of asthma in later life. Consistent with this notion, epidemiological studies have documented an association between severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection early in life and asthma development (<a href=\"#bib11\">James et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, persistent RSV-induced wheezing before 3 years of age is associated with chronic asthma persisting into adulthood (<a href=\"#bib40\">Taussig et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wright et al., 1989</a>). However, whether early life viral infections contribute to the development of paucigranulocytic asthma has yet to be investigated."

For example, we have previously shown that <i>Tlr7<sup>-/</sup></i><sup>-</sup> mice display the cardinal features of asthma following an earlier life and later life infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; a murine analogue of RSV) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kaiko et al., 2013</a>). This is consistent with the observation that, compared to non-asthmatic individuals, TLR7 function is reduced in adolescents with asthma (<a href=\"#bib33\">Roponen et al., 2010</a>). There is also a growing body of evidence implicating high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) in disease development (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sukkar et al., 2012</a>). HMGB1 is an alarmin that acts as a non-histone nuclear protein in quiescent cells. Upon cell stimulation (such as by the presence of a pathogen) HMGB1 becomes phosphorylated and is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Upon release, extracellular HMGB1 can bind to receptors such as RAGE, toll-like receptor (TLR) two and TLR4, and trigger a pro-inflammatory response (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lotze and Tracey, 2005</a>). Increased levels of HMGB1 have been detected in the sputum of patients\u00a0with\u00a0asthma and high levels of HMGB1 have been associated with reduced lung function (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hou et al., 2011</a>)."

This receptor is expressed as membrane-bound (mRAGE) and soluble (sRAGE) forms; the latter is produced primarily by shedding of mRAGE (<a href=\"#bib31\">Raucci et al., 2008</a>) and is thought to function as a \u2018decoy\u2019 receptor, preventing RAGE ligands from interacting with mRAGE, which would normally trigger inflammation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Schmidt, 2015</a>). Of note, a non-synonymous variant (rs2070600) in the <i>AGER</i> gene (which encodes RAGE) is a strong determinant of serum sRAGE levels (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Maruthur et al., 2015</a>), with the rs2070600:C allele (encoding a Gly at position 82) being associated with increased sRAGE. This same allele is associated with decreased risk of allergic asthma (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.87, p=0.003 in [<a href=\"#bib5\">Ferreira et al., 2014</a>]). Taken together, the\u00a0results from these genetic studies indicate that decreased signalling through mRAGE (as a result of increased sRAGE production) might have a protective effect in allergic asthma. This prediction is complicated by the apparently conflicting observation that rs2070600:C (which results in increased sRAGE) is associated with decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. However, it is important to note that this analysis was performed in the general population (<a href=\"#bib32\">Repapi et al., 2010</a>), and hence cannot be associated with asthma or allergic disease. Intriguingly, RAGE deficiency or HMGB1 neutralisation ameliorates type-2 inflammation in preclinical models of allergic asthma (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ullah et al., 2014</a>). However, whether RAGE or HMGB1 contribute to viral bronchiolitis in early life, and the subsequent development of viral-induced asthma, remains to be determined."

The resulting increase in viral load in the airway epithelium led to the release of HMGB1, which via the activation of TLR4 was instrumental in driving ASM remodelling during an early life viral infection, as well as the development of mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperreactivity in later life. Critically, these features occurred independently of type-2 inflammation and granulocytic inflammation, suggesting that blocking HMGB1 may be a promising therapeutic approach to prevent the development of airway remodelling, which can occur in the absence of eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation."

Day seven was selected as the time point of interest, as this represents the peak of PVM replication in mice (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kaiko et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bonville et al., 2006</a>). Infected RAGE deficient mice had significantly higher levels of PVM RNA seven dpi compared to infected WT mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, in light of the fact that qPCR cannot differentiate between infectious and non-infectious viral particles, and the fact that PVM titres are notoriously difficult to assess by plaque assay (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dyer et al., 2007</a>), we also measured active PVM infection by immunohistochemistry. RAGE deficient mice displayed a significantly higher percentage of PVM infected airway epithelial cells (AECs) in the respiratory tract compared to WT mice at seven dpi (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B &amp; C</a>). This increased infection was associated with lower levels of IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03bb and IFN\u03b3 in the BAL fluid and lungs at seven dpi in PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> &amp; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Interestingly, there was no significant difference in IFN production between mock- and PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice, suggesting that RAGE deficient mice were unable to mount an IFN response following infection with PVM (p&gt;0.999). Consistent with this notion, PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice had significantly lower expression of interferon regulatory factor (<i>IRF7</i>) (which regulates IFN\u03b1 production) relative to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

We thus reasoned that the attenuated IFN production and associated increased viral infection observed in RAGE deficient mice would be associated with defective pDC recruitment. To determine whether lung pDCs expressed RAGE, we took advantage of the RAGE deficient mouse in which the functional <i>Ager</i> gene is replaced by <i>GFP</i>. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated that pDCs derived from RAGE deficient mice were GFP<sup>+</sup>, indicating that under normal circumstances, wild-type lung pDCs express RAGE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We next determined whether the absence of RAGE would affect pDC recruitment to the lungs. At seven dpi, there were significantly fewer pDCs in the lungs of PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice compared to PVM-infected WT mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), and similar to the IFN response, there was no significant difference in pDC recruitment between mock- and PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) (p=0.6769).

Thus, we measured the levels of the alarmins IL-33, IL-1\u03b1 and HMGB1 in the lungs of neonatal WT and RAGE deficient mice at seven dpi. Whilst the levels of IL-33 and IL-1\u03b1 were elevated in infected WT mice, there was no difference in expression between mock- and PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (p&gt;0.999).

This is associated with increased HMGB1 levels which then drives an increase in ASM mass. This model would thus suggest that the addition of exogenous interferon would not only reduce virus replication in RAGE deficient mice but that it would also reduce the levels of extracellular HMGB1 and ASM mass. In order to test this hypothesis, neonatal RAGE deficient mice were treated with 5000 U of IFN-\u03b1 or diluent alone at three dpi. At seven dpi, the mice were euthanised and the viral load, HMGB1 levels and ASM mass were assessed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Exogenous IFN-\u03b1 significantly decreased viral load in AECs compared to mock-treated mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

This response then leads to the onset of type-2 inflammation early in life which, upon re-infection in later life, is re-activated to promote the hallmark pathologies of asthma (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kaiko et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, we next investigated the inflammatory profile of RAGE deficient and WT mice following mock or PVM infection. Analysis of the BAL cells by differential cell count showed that there was no significant difference in the numbers of eosinophils, neutrophils or lymphocytes between mock- and PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (p=0.1161; p=0.6107; p=0.0826 and p=0.8023).

Indeed, the only cytokine that was elevated in RAGE deficient mice upon infection with PVM was TNF-\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In order to confirm that the observed phenotype occurred in the absence of a pronounced type-2 response, PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice were treated with soluble IL-13R\u03b12 fusion protein (to neutralise IL-13) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Blocking IL-13 failed to reduce viral infection of AECs, ASM mass, or cytoplasmic HMGB1 levels in AECs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a>). (p=0.7422; p=0.8369 and p=0.4266).

In the present study, we demonstrated impaired pDC recruitment and decreased production of IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b3, -\u03bb in RAGE deficient mice during an early life PVM infection, resulting in a higher viral load in the airway epithelium. The increased viral replication in neonatal RAGE deficient mice observed in this study was associated with the extracellular release of HMGB1, most likely as a consequence of virus-induced AEC stress. Increased levels of HMGB1 then drove an increase in ASM mass. This increase in ASM mass was dependent upon TLR4. Re-inoculation of RAGE deficient mice with PVM later in life, whilst resulting in a non-productive infection, exacerbated ASM growth and induced other characteristic features of asthma such as mucus hyper-secretion and airway hyperreactivity (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>). Importantly, this asthma-like phenotype occurred in the absence of a pronounced eosinophilic or neutrophilic response. Thus, this model represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first mouse model that recapitulates the cardinal features of paucigranulocytic asthma."

The ability of anti-HMGB1 treatment to reduce cytoplasmic HMGB1 staining most likely reflects the ability of this antibody to inhibit extracellular HMGB1. Upon its release, HMGB1 can act back on cells to induce de novo HMGB1 synthesis and its release, to amplify the inflammatory response (<a href=\"#bib30\">Porto et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, blocking extracellular HMGB1 can indirectly lower intracellular levels of HMGB1. Previous studies have also demonstrated that extracellular HMGB1 can be internalised (<a href=\"#bib48\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that blocking extracellular HMGB1 reduced intracellular HMGB1 by decreasing HMGB1 uptake (<a href=\"#bib48\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). However, it is important to note that HMGB1 internalisation is a RAGE-dependent process (<a href=\"#bib48\">Xu et al., 2014</a>) and hence less likely to be relevant in RAGE deficient mice."

HMGB1 can induce smooth muscle proliferation <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Porto et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that HMGB1 is capable of mediating ASM growth in the absence of any other intermediary signalling molecule. Interestingly, blocking HMGB1 during the primary PVM infection also served to increase IFN\u2013\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb production and reduced viral load in RAGE deficient mice. We did not explore the mechanism by which anti-HMGB1 augments IFN production in our model. However, HMGB1 can inhibit IFN-\u03b1 production by pDCs in response to CpG containing DNA (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lotze and Tracey, 2005</a>), highlighting an important role for HMGB1 in regulating type I interferon responses."

Although this hypothesis requires further investigation, blocking HMGB1 could be an approach that is readily translated to the clinic given that anti-HMGB1 treatments have already been approved for clinical trials to block systemic inflammation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ulloa and Messmer, 2006</a>). Interestingly, several of the viruses and bacteria that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma are also known to induce HMGB1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Moisy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hou et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">1999</a>). Indeed, our preliminary data suggest that later life exposure to either influenza A virus or lipopolysaccharide (known HMGB1 stimuli) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nosaka et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Gardella et al., 2002</a>) are able to induce at least some features of airway remodelling in RAGE deficient mice that were infected with PVM in early life (data not shown). These data thus also raise the possibility that the mechanisms of disease shown here may not be limited to PVM-induced asthma. Similarly, we previously identified that HMGB1 was common to the pathogenesis of house dust mite- and cockroach-induced allergic asthma in mice (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ullah et al., 2014</a>). Collectively, these findings and others highlight a central role for HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of multiple subtypes of asthma."

In light of the fact that TLR4 was essential for ASM growth and the cardinal features of asthma in this model, it is tempting to speculate that disulphide HMGB1/TLR4 interactions are sufficient to induce early life airway remodelling and the development of asthma later in life. This is consistent with the fact that the protective anti-HMGB1 antibody used in the present study blocks all-thiol and disulphide HMGB1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yang et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhu et al., 2015</a>).

Compared to TLR7 deficient mice, re-infected RAGE deficient mice did not develop type-2 eosinophilic inflammation nor did they generate a neutrophilic response. In TLR7 deficient mice, the type-2 inflammation was underpinned by an IFN-\u03b1<sup>low</sup>/IL-33<sup>high</sup> cytokine microenvironment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kaiko et al., 2013</a>), whereas the absence of RAGE attenuated the production of both IFN\u2013\u03b1 and IL-33. Others have demonstrated that RAGE deficient mice produce lower levels of both type-1 and type-2 cytokines in an ovalbumin model of allergic asthma (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akirav et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, we have previously shown that type-2 eosinophilic inflammation, induced in response to either house dust mite or cockroach sensitisation/challenge, is significantly reduced in the absence of RAGE (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ullah et al., 2014</a>). The mechanism by which the activation of RAGE contributes to type-2 inflammation remains poorly defined. However, it is noteworthy that RAGE is necessary for the lung infiltration of type-2 innate lymphoid cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Oczypok et al., 2015</a>), a cell type that is increasingly implicated in the priming and amplification of type two immunity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Oliphant et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, the absence of a pronounced neutrophilic response in re-infected RAGE deficient mice is consistent with the role of RAGE in neutrophil recruitment (<a href=\"#bib27\">Orlova et al., 2007</a>). Thus, although HMGB1-mediated activation of RAGE promotes type-2 inflammation (which is known to induce the hallmark pathologies of asthma), in the absence of RAGE HMGB1 can directly induce features of airway remodelling and thus contribute to airway hyperreactivity independently of type-2 inflammation."

Moreover, whether specific genetic mutations lead to a propensity to develop pauciogranulocytic asthma (instead of, for example, eosinophilic asthma) has yet to be studied. However, the data presented here suggest that defective RAGE signaling contributes to the development and progression of airway remodeling in the absence of Th2/Th17-mediated granulocytic inflammation Given that we identified HMGB1 as a central mediator in the pathogenesis of airway remodelling, our findings suggest that anti-HMGB1 therapy may be a novel therapeutic for the treatment of asthma, irrespective of inflammatory cell subtype."

Also, tone down the references used to \"paucigranulocytic asthma\" because this is a concept that has really only been identified in a cross-sectional manner with no longitudinal demonstration that is a stable phenotype over time, and therefore a real stable asthma phenotype in man. It is interesting that the asthma end points that the authors studied in mice showed changes that are relevant to asthma; they find no increases in neutrophils and eosinophils and this does suggest that if paucigranulocytic asthma is a real stable phenotype, and that the mechanisms they have identified may be relevant to that phenotype. As mentioned, it is not yet accepted as a stable phenotype different from other phenotypes."

Also, tone down the references used to \"paucigranulocytic asthma\" because this is a concept that has really only been identified in a cross-sectional manner with no longitudinal demonstration that is a stable phenotype over time, and therefore a real stable asthma phenotype in man. It is interesting that the asthma end points that the authors studied in mice showed changes that are relevant to asthma; they find no increases in neutrophils and eosinophils and this does suggest that if paucigranulocytic asthma is a real stable phenotype, and that the mechanisms they have identified may be relevant to that phenotype.

In the absence of viral control, the elevated viral load in the epithelium leads to the release of HMGB1. We hypothesise that the HMGB1 further blunts the antiviral host response by inhibiting type I IFN production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, as described by Lotze and Tracey (Nat. Immunol. 2005). Inhibition of interferon production then results in increased viral replication which, in turn, results in increased HMGB1 release in a positive feedback loop. In response to the reviewer\u2019s query we have now included a discussion of this point in the third paragraph of the Discussion.

Our working hypothesis is that the virus infects but does not replicate in macrophages or the airway epithelium and that the infection is sufficient to activate a pathway that induces the release of HMGB1. In addition to the experiments performed herein, we were also interested in determining whether the observed effects were restricted to reinfection with PVM. To answer this question we have performed experiments whereby we replaced the secondary infection with PVM with influenza A virus (PR8/34[H1N1]), a known stimulant of HMGB1 production (e.g. Nosaka et al., Critical Care, 2015). The data shown in <a href=\"#fig15\">Author response image 1</a> demonstrate that influenza A virus (IAV) is also able to trigger ASM growth in RAGE<sup>-/-</sup> mice that have been infected with PVM in early life. In an attempt to address the reviewers\u2019 question, we also investigated whether LPS, an inducer of HMGB1 release (Gardella et al.,2002; EMBO reports) but also a ligand of TLR4, would be sufficient to promote airway remodelling. Mice were infected with PVM in early life were treated intranasally with LPS at 42-47 days post primary infection. LPS increased ASM levels above those observed in PVM + mock treated mice. How an early life infection with PVM alters the pulmonary environment such that the mice are \u2018sensitised\u2019 to a later life viral infection or pro-inflammatory stimulus remains an area of ongoing research in our laboratory. We have now included discussion of these data in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion."
