                    "text": "During gamete formation, crossover recombination must occur on replicated DNA to ensure proper chromosome segregation in the first meiotic division. We identified a Mec1/ATR- and Dbf4-dependent replication checkpoint in budding yeast that prevents the earliest stage of recombination, the programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), when pre-meiotic DNA replication was delayed. The checkpoint acts through three complementary mechanisms: inhibition of Mer2 phosphorylation by Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase, preclusion of chromosomal loading of Rec114 and Mre11, and lowered abundance of the Spo11 nuclease. Without this checkpoint, cells formed DSBs on partially replicated chromosomes. Importantly, such DSBs frequently failed to be repaired and impeded further DNA synthesis, leading to a rapid loss in cell viability. We conclude that a checkpoint-dependent constraint of DSB formation to duplicated DNA is critical not only for meiotic chromosome assortment, but also to protect genome integrity during gametogenesis."

We identified a Mec1/ATR- and Dbf4-dependent replication checkpoint in budding yeast that prevents the earliest stage of recombination, the programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), when pre-meiotic DNA replication was delayed. The checkpoint acts through three complementary mechanisms: inhibition of Mer2 phosphorylation by Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase, preclusion of chromosomal loading of Rec114 and Mre11, and lowered abundance of the Spo11 nuclease. Without this checkpoint, cells formed DSBs on partially replicated chromosomes. Importantly, such DSBs frequently failed to be repaired and impeded further DNA synthesis, leading to a rapid loss in cell viability. We conclude that a checkpoint-dependent constraint of DSB formation to duplicated DNA is critical not only for meiotic chromosome assortment, but also to protect genome integrity during gametogenesis."

In most organisms, the faithful segregation of homologous chromosome pairs in meiosis I relies on physical connections between homologs produced by meiotic recombination. In budding yeast, DNA exchanges between homologs are the result of the repair of \u223c160 DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which occur immediately following pre-meiotic S phase (meiS) and are distributed across all 16 chromosome pairs. DSB formation requires the concerted activity of 10 proteins, including the catalytic subunit Spo11 and its partner Ski8, the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX) complex, and the meiosis-specific proteins Mer2, Rec114, Mei4, Rec102 and Rec104 (reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib26\">Keeney and Neale, 2006</a>)). Additionally, DSB formation requires the phosphorylation of Mer2 by two cell cycle kinases, cyclin dependent-kinase (CDK) and the Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Henderson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sasanuma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wan et al., 2008</a>).

This temporal separation is necessary because the crossover-mediated linkages between homologs require sister-chromatid cohesion distal to the crossover site. Thus, only crossovers formed after DNA replication serve to hold homologous chromosomes together in metaphase I. Moreover, replication forks are unable to cross a DSB (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doksani et al., 2009</a>), so the presence of &gt;100 DSBs in the genome would severely interfere with the completion of DNA replication."

DNA replication and DSB formation are coordinated at the local level, because delayed replication of a single chromosome arm delays DSB formation on that arm (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borde et al., 2000</a>). However, DSB formation does not require DNA replication; pre-meiotic replication initiation mutants introduce full levels of DSBs on chromosomes that are not replicated in both budding and fission yeasts (<a href=\"#bib33\">Murakami and Nurse, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hochwagen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2012</a>). In addition, the initiation of meiotic recombination is prevented globally when DNA replication is delayed by nucleotide depletion (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schild and Byers, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tonami et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ogino and Masai, 2006</a>). In fission yeast, a replication checkpoint blocks DSB formation in this situation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tonami et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ogino and Masai, 2006</a>). Although a related checkpoint was found to delay the meiotic divisions upon nucleotide depletion in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stuart and Wittenberg, 1998</a>), a subsequent study came to the conclusion that it did not regulate DSB formation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borde et al., 2000</a>).

The fact that the replication checkpoint inhibits DDK activity in mitotic cells suggests that the checkpoint could be easily adapted to prevent meiotic DSBs by preventing the DDK-dependent phosphorylation of Mer2. To characterize the replication checkpoint during meiotic cell division, we investigated the effects of inhibiting pre-meiotic DNA replication. We found that the replication checkpoint is active in budding yeast meiosis and inhibits DSB formation. The checkpoint uses parallel mechanisms to regulate the abundance, DNA loading and DDK-dependent phosphorylation of DSB factors. Cells that formed DSBs on partially replicated chromosomes were unable to complete either DSB repair or genome duplication, revealing that the separation of DNA replication and meiotic DSB formation is critical for maintaining genome integrity and viability."

Because we previously observed significantly delayed meiotic entry when cells were treated with high concentrations of HU (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2012</a>), all of our analyses were carried out with 20 mM or lower amounts of HU. FACS analysis of total DNA content revealed that DNA replication occurred between 1\u20133 hr for wild-type cells in the absence of HU, was significantly delayed in 5 mM HU, and arrested in early S phase in 20 mM HU (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). DSB formation was comparably affected when measured by Southern blot analysis of a prominent DSB hotspot on chromosome 3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Quantification of FACS profiles and Southern analysis revealed that DSBs appeared just after bulk DNA replication was completed (4C DNA content appeared) in 0 or 5 mM HU samples, and were fully suppressed when replication was blocked by 20 mM HU (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Consistent with the idea that slowing DNA replication activates the replication checkpoint, we detected HU-dependent Rad53 autophosphorylation by Western blotting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), which has been shown to be a direct effect of checkpoint activation in pre-mitotic cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pellicioli et al., 1999</a>). In addition, we found that Mec1 and Rad53 were essential to maintain viability in HU-treated pre-meiotic cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that activation of the pre-meiotic replication checkpoint is critical to maintain replication forks in the presence of replication inhibition, as in pre-mitotic cells."

DNA replication is strongly decreased in <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hochwagen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2012</a>). This decrease was due to impaired replicative helicase loading (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and little DNA replication was observed in 0, 5 or 20 mM HU (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells formed DSBs with wild-type kinetics in all concentrations of HU despite the absence of any completed DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>), consistent with the idea that depleting the number of active replication forks abrogates the replication checkpoint signal. Importantly, we were unable to detect phosphorylation of Rad53 at 2\u20133 hr when DSBs formed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), indicating that the replication checkpoint is not efficiently activated in these cells. When <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells were exposed to concentrations of HU greater than 20 mM, DSB formation was either reduced or abolished without activation of Rad53 (data not shown), consistent with our previous report that high levels of HU can inhibit meiotic cell cycle entry (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2012</a>). This could explain why the checkpoint was previously not observed (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borde et al., 2000</a>). Together, these data confirm that the canonical Mec1- and Rad53-dependent replication checkpoint responds to delayed DNA replication in budding yeast meiosis, and that DSB formation is delayed while DNA replication is ongoing."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, when pre-meiotic cells were treated with HU, Dbf4 accumulated mainly in a hyperphosphorylated state. The amount of hyperphosphorylated Dbf4 was reduced in both <i>mec1</i>\u0394 and <i>rad53</i>\u0394 cells treated with HU (top panel), indicating that the massive accumulation of this form of the protein is checkpoint-dependent in meiotic cells as it is in mitotic cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</a>). For this analysis we used a polyclonal antibody to Dbf4, having noted that the C-terminally myc-tagged protein was unstable and present at much lower levels and with degradation products, compared to the untagged protein (data not shown). Consistent with the idea that the hyperphosphorylated form of Dbf4 is inactive in the cell, Mer2 accumulated in a hypophosphorylated form in HU-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, bottom panel) only when Mec1 and Rad53 were present. Because Mer2 is sequentially phosphorylated by both CDK and DDK prior to meiotic DSB formation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sasanuma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wan et al., 2008</a>), we confirmed that Mer2 was phosphorylated by CDK in HU-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), indicating that HU treatment specifically inhibited DDK-dependent phosphorylation of Mer2. These results indicate that the replication checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Rad53 restrain DSB formation by limiting the activity of DDK, a role well established in the mitotic replication checkpoint."

We tested several previously characterized alleles of <i>DBF4</i> in our Southern blot assay for DSBs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Cells expressing <i>dbf4-NLS</i>\u0394<i>N221</i>, an N-terminal truncation protein containing an SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) to support viability, formed high levels of DSBs in the presence of HU (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) without a substantial increase in DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The replication checkpoint bypass was dominant as DSBs also occurred in cells heterozygous for this <i>dbf4</i> allele (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This result indicates that deregulating DDK activity is sufficient to allow the initiation of meiotic recombination in the presence of ongoing DNA replication. The dbf4-NLS\u0394N221 protein lacks the conserved N domain that has been shown to interact with Rad53 and other proteins (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gabrielse et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). However, cells harboring a smaller truncation of <i>DBF4</i> that maintains the native NLS but removes the Rad53 interaction domain, <i>dbf4</i>-\u0394<i>71-221</i>, bypassed the replication checkpoint poorly (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), indicating that disrupting the Rad53 interaction alone is not sufficient to deregulate Dbf4 activity. Similarly, addition of the SV40 NLS to the wild-type Dbf4 protein did not allow for DSBs in HU-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), indicating the strong NLS was not solely responsible for the replication checkpoint bypass of the <i>dbf4-NLS</i>\u0394N<i>221</i> allele. Thus, multiple functions of the Dbf4 N-terminus are likely required for the regulation of meiotic DSBs in response replication stress. We conclude that DDK regulation is critical in the pre-meiotic replication checkpoint."

A <i>dbf4</i> allele lacking 25 potential phosphorylation sites, <i>dbf4-m25</i>, allows the initiation of DNA replication from late origins in HU-treated pre-mitotic cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</a>). However, this mutation did not permit DSB formation in pre-meiotic cells treated with HU (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This result indicates that simply preventing the Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of Dbf4 is insufficient to accumulate enough DDK activity to form meiotic DSBs in HU-treated cells. Furthermore, the <i>dbf4-NLS</i>\u0394<i>N221</i> allele produced a truncated protein that shifted mobility consistent with phosphorylation in the presence of HU (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), despite the fact that 21 of the 25 mutations in the <i>dbf4-m25</i> allele are within the deleted region. These results suggest either the <i>dbf4-NLS</i>\u0394<i>N221</i> mutant protein is unable to respond to Rad53-dependent phosphorylation, or that separate phosphorylation sites are required to prevent meiotic DSBs. We ruled out a function for the sole Mec1 consensus site on Dbf4, because mutation of threonine 163 to alanine did not allow DSB formation in HU (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Together, these data reveal that deregulating DDK is sufficient to allow DSBs in HU-treated cells.

These results were confirmed in <i>dmc1</i>\u0394 repair-deficient strains, which arrest in meiotic prophase with resected DNA ends (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), indicating they were not specific to the <i>rad50S</i> allele used in our initial assays. We eliminated the possibility that the pre-meiotic replication checkpoint utilizes alternate signaling kinases by simultaneously removing Mek1, Chk1 and Rad53, which did not allow DSB formation in HU-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Similarly, neither removal of Rad53 kinase activity nor the deletion of the Rad53 activating proteins Rad9 and Mrc1 allowed DSBs to form in HU-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). Indeed, removal of Mec1, but not Rad53, Rad53 kinase activity or Rad53-dependent phosphorylation sites on Dbf4, allowed DSB formation across entire chromosomes in both <i>rad50S</i> and <i>dmc1</i>\u0394 repair-deficient strains (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,D</a>). We noted that the lack of checkpoint bypass in the absence of Rad53 is in contrast to the bypass observed in Dbf4 truncation mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). These findings argue against a strictly linear pathway, in which Mec1 acts through Rad53 to inhibit DDK, but rather suggest that there are Rad53-independent functions of the replication checkpoint in meiosis."

A DSB-promoting role for Rad53 is also supported by our observation that deletion of <i>RAD53</i> reduced the DSB levels of <i>mec1</i>\u0394 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In this case, DSBs were formed in HU-treated <i>mec1</i>\u0394 <i>rad53</i>\u0394 cells, but the break levels were substantially lower than in <i>mec1</i>\u0394 cells alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A,C and 4A</a>), indicating Mec1 and Rad53 regulate DSBs using separate pathways. The <i>rad50S</i> mutation leads to the formation of blunt-ended DSBs that are detected by a Tel1 and Rad53-dependent checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Usui et al., 2001</a>). We found that removal of Tel1 also lowered DSB levels in the absence of HU at the <i>yCR048W</i> hotspot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and on whole chromosomes analyzed by pulsed-field gel analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), consistent with a recent report (<a href=\"#bib1\">Argunhan et al., 2013</a>). Similar to the <i>rad53</i>\u0394 mutation, deletion of <i>TEL1</i> also reduced DSBs in a <i>mec1\u20131</i> background, while still allowing for replication checkpoint bypass in the presence of HU (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Intriguingly, DSBs levels were also lowered in <i>dbf4-NLS</i>\u0394<i>N221</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), but not <i>dbf4-m25</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)<i>,</i> suggesting that Rad53 might promote DDK activity in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Thus, Tel1 and Rad53 are required to achieve maximal DSB levels in <i>rad50S</i> cells, whereas Mec1 inhibits DSBs in response to delayed replication using both Rad53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These data extend recent findings that multiple checkpoint pathways modulate DSB formation in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib53a\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Argunhan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carballo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18a\">Gray et al., 2013</a>)."

These changes are unlikely to be a consequence of direct phosphorylation by Mec1, as no protein showed the expected reduced mobility in HU-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, we noted that several protein bands showed faster mobility upon HU treatment, including Mer2, Rec104 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), Sae2/CtIP and Rec8 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As Mer2 and Rec8 are both reported to be DDK targets, it is possible that the increased mobility of these proteins in the presence of HU is the result of the decreased DDK activity we observed. Sae2 shows checkpoint- and cell-cycle dependent phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huertas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Manfrini et al., 2010</a>) and Rec104 has previously been described as a meiotic phospho-protein (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kee et al., 2004</a>).

We found that deletion of <i>MEC1</i> restored Rec114-13myc loading in the presence of HU whereas deletion of <i>RAD53</i> did not (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, left panels), indicating that inhibition of Rec114 chromosome loading is Mec1-specific. Given that Rec114 forms a complex with Mer2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arora et al., 2004</a>), it is possible that Rec114 DNA loading depends on Mer2 phosphorylation. However, we do not believe this to be case, as Mer2 was equally phosphorylated in both <i>mec1\u0394</i> and <i>rad53\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), yet Rec114 loading was specifically regulated by Mec1. Furthermore, Rec114-13myc could not be detected on chromosomes in HU-treated cells containing the <i>mer2-DDD</i> allele that mimics the DDK-dependent phosphorylations (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wan et al., 2008</a>) (data not shown), consistent with the idea that Mer2 phosphorylation is not sufficient to recruit Rec114 to the DNA when Mec1 is activated."

However, the pattern of Mre11 DNA-binding was altered dramatically in checkpoint mutant cells (<i>mec1\u0394</i> and <i>rad53\u0394</i>) treated with HU; Mre11 association with core meiotic chromosomal binding sites was substantially lower than in untreated cells, and the protein instead accumulated close to every pre-meiotic replication origin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, dashed grey lines). Indeed, Mre11 was significantly enriched specifically at replication origins in <i>mec1\u0394</i> cells treated with HU (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>, p values from Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test). We believe this to be the result of Mre11 recruitment to the aberrant DNA damage structures that form at replication forks when the replication checkpoint is impaired (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feng et al., 2006</a>). This extensive relocalization of Mre11 may explain why DSB levels in <i>mec1\u0394</i> cells are lower in the presence of HU than without treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The specific inhibition of Rec114 and Mre11 loading by Mec1 reveals an additional Rad53-independent replication checkpoint pathway."

Therefore, we employed the <i>cdc6-mn</i> strain, which experiences high levels of meiotic DSBs on chromosomes that have undergone very little replication (schematic <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Although Cdc6 protein levels are strongly depleted in <i>cdc6-mn</i> mutants (data not shown), low levels of DNA replication were observed in this strain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, shoulder to the right of 2C DNA). To rule out the possibility that this was break-induced replication (BIR), we depleted DSBs in the <i>cdc6-mn</i> strain using a hypomorphic <i>SPO11</i> allele. Remarkably, rather than observing a reduction in DNA replication, as would be expected if the shoulder in the FACS profile was due to BIR, we observed a substantial increase in DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

The DNA content increase was not due to mitochondrial DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), but rather because whole chromosomes were sporadically replicated and segregated in the <i>cdc6-mn</i> strain, as revealed by the occasional duplication and segregation of a single chromosome marked with a <i>TetO</i> array/TetR-GFP (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Although we were unable to detect the loading of Mcm2-7 helicase in <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells by genome-wide location analysis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), we believe that the <i>SCC1</i> promoter driving <i>CDC6</i> expression in the <i>cdc6-mn</i> strain allows for leaky expression that permits an undetectable amount of Cdc6 to act stochastically at replication origins throughout the genome. We suggest that the infrequency of these events precludes detection by population-based assays. Consistent with this idea, when we measured DNA replication in the <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells after 8 hr in sporulation medium compared to G1 unreplicated DNA, no specific chromosomes or regions of the genome were preferentially replicated except the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Because the rDNA contains \u223c100 tandem 9.1 kb repeats, each with its own potential origin of replication, the chance that one of these repeats would load Mcm2-7 and initiate DNA replication is extremely high, compared to the 11\u201346 origins present in the single-copy regions of each chromosome. Therefore, we conclude that <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells undergo sporadic chromosomal replication initiation, although clearly the levels of replication are too low to promote a checkpoint response in the critical period, during which DSBs must be prevented (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>)."

Engineered restriction sites at this locus permit the measurement of DSB repair by Southern blot analysis. In wild-type cells, DSB formation is followed by the accumulation of double-Holliday junction repair intermediates. These intermediates are subsequently resolved into crossover products that show an altered molecular weight from the parental fragments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). DSBs formed at wild-type levels at <i>HIS4-LEU2</i> in <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells, and a subset of DSBs were converted into crossovers, indicating that <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells are able to undergo homologous recombination.

We analyzed <i>ndt80\u0394</i>, <i>cdc6-mn ndt80\u0394</i> and <i>cdc6-mn spo11\u0394 ndt80\u0394</i> strains that were blocked in meiotic prophase to prevent meiotic chromosome segregation (experimental outline in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), and measured DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) and viability (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Cells returned to rich medium prior to meiotic entry (0 hr), should express <i>CDC6</i> normally from the <i>SCC1</i> promoter, and, accordingly, we observed no defect in DNA replication or cell division (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, middle three panels). When cells remained in sporulation medium, little DNA replication occurred in <i>cdc6-mn ndt80\u0394</i> cells, but much more was observed in <i>cdc6-mn spo11\u0394 ndt80\u0394</i> cells by 30 hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, left three panels), showing that DSBs substantially impeded the completion of DNA replication in the <i>cdc6-mn</i> background. When cells were returned to growth in rich medium after 5 hr in sporulation medium, wild-type cells had already completed DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, first right panel), and returned to cycling with 100% viability (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). In contrast, <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells were able to complete very little DNA replication upon return to growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, second to last panel) and lost viability quickly after exposure to sporulation medium (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Removal of Spo11 allowed more DNA replication upon return to growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, compare last two panels) and the <i>spo11\u0394</i> strain exhibited significantly increased viability over the <i>SPO11</i> strain. We confirmed that replication-checkpoint bypass similarly results in HU- and Spo11-dependent lethality in the <i>dbf4-NLS\u0394N221</i> strain background in unblocked meiosis (top panel), as well as in prophase-arrested cells (<i>ndt80\u0394</i>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Together, these results reveal that preventing DSB formation on replicating chromosomes is essential to inhibit a lethal meiotic chromosome fragmentation event that significantly impedes both the completion of DNA replication, and the repair of meiotic DSBs."

Meiotic cells detect replication stress using the canonical replication checkpoint machinery, which then regulates meiosis-specific processes. As during mitotic S phase, detection of HU-induced replication inhibition relies on Mec1 and Ddc2. Mec1 activates the Rad53 effector kinase, which, in turn, inhibits DDK activity. The essential roles of Mec1 and Rad53 in maintaining replication fork stability appear to be equally important in meiotic cells, as removing either protein is lethal when cells are exposed to HU in meiS. Similar to the mitotic replication checkpoint, redundant and separable Mec1- and Rad53-dependent mechanisms maintain genome stability and prevent precocious cell-cycle progression in the presence of replication inhibition during meiosis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Labib and De Piccoli, 2011</a>).

First, Mec1 downregulates <i>SPO11</i> transcript levels. Although Spo11 production is not completely prevented, we believe that downregulation of Spo11 has functional consequences because genetically decreasing Spo11 activity was able to significantly rescue DNA replication in the <i>cdc6-mn</i> strain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Second, Mec1 activity strongly reduces the DNA loading of Rec114 and Mre11. Rec114 is phosphorylated in a Mec1-dependent manner in response to meiotic DSBs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carballo et al., 2013</a>). However, such phosphorylation was found to increase Rec114 chromosomal association and we found no evidence that Rec114 or Mre11 are direct targets of Mec1 during meiS. The lack of DSB factor loading could be due to impaired axis formation, in spite of the fact that Rec8, Hop1 and Red1 load robustly onto the DNA in HU-treated cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2012</a>). Alternatively, the DSB factors may be directly regulated by the replication checkpoint. Third, Rad53-dependent inhibition of DDK prevents Mer2 phosphorylation, which is expected to block meiotic DSBs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sasanuma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wan et al., 2008</a>). The redundancy resulting from the separable inhibition of all of the major DSB complexes likely increases the speed and robustness of the checkpoint response, which is important given the severe repair defects and lethality associated with precocious DSB formation on unreplicated DNA."

HU treatment resulted in Mec1- and Rad53-dependent Dbf4 phosphorylation and a block of DDK target phosphorylation. However, neither removal of Rad53 (which prevented Dbf4 hyperphosphorylation and allowed for Mer2 phosphorylation) nor the dbf4-m25 non-phosphorylatable protein allowed DSBs in the presence of HU, indicating that simply allowing DDK activation does not bypass the pre-meiotic replication checkpoint. Furthermore, the dbf4-\u039471-221 protein that cannot interact with Rad53 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013</a>) also did not allow for checkpoint bypass. The only form of Dbf4 that allowed for efficient DSB formation in HU-treated cells was dbf4-NLS\u0394N221, which appears to be an unregulated version of the protein that is dominant to the wild-type. The fact that the <i>dbf4-NLS\u0394N221</i> strain is not sensitive to HU in mitotic cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gabrielse et al., 2006</a>) suggests that this allele does not bypass checkpoint activation, but rather acts downstream or in parallel to Mec1 and Rad53. It is possible that dbf4-NLS\u0394N221 is hyperactive compared to the wild-type protein and overcomes the checkpoint, or that it accumulates DDK activity early and \u2018licenses\u2019 DSBs before the replication checkpoint is activated. Regardless of the mechanism, our results clearly indicate that controlling DDK activity is a critical step in regulating DSB formation."

Therefore, Rad53 activity may be specifically suppressed during prophase by the DSBs in <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells. Rad53 can be activated later in meiosis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cartagena-Lirola et al., 2008</a>), and consistently, we noted that Rad53 became activated at later time points in <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells treated with HU (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), which proceed into the meiotic divisions with replication forks and DSBs. An alternative and non-exclusive model is that no replication checkpoint is activated in <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells either because Cdc6 itself is a checkpoint factor, as has been suggested for <i>S. pombe</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hermand and Nurse, 2007</a>), or the number of replication forks is too low to promote checkpoint activation.

Measuring the kinetics of DNA replication and DSB formation in both unchallenged and HU-treated cells indicated that DSB formation occurs with a fixed delay with respect to the appearance of 4C (replicated) DNA, consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib37\">Padmore et al., 1991</a>). Therefore, it appears that under normal circumstances, DSBs occur only after bulk DNA replication. Furthermore, DSB formation seems to be timed independently from DNA replication, as it did not occur significantly earlier in <i>cdc6-mn</i> replication-depleted or checkpoint mutants cells, suggesting the order and timing of the two processes are under independent cell cycle controls. A second mechanism to directly couple DNA replication and DSB formation has been described; delaying DNA replication on the left arm of chromosome 3 similarly delays local DSB formation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borde et al., 2000</a>). However, we do not believe this coordination is the same as the checkpoint described here, as delaying DNA replication with low concentrations of HU was sufficient to block DSB formation until 4C DNA appeared, that is when meiS was completed. The local delay of DSB formation with late forks is likely necessary, because we have shown here that the replication checkpoint is insensitive to very low levels of DNA replication, such as in the <i>cdc6-mn</i> mutant. Therefore, any genomic regions with late forks that do not complete replication inside of the normal S phase would be subject to this second coupling mechanism to ensure DSBs do not occur prior to replication completion. The severe phenotype exhibited by cells that make breaks on replicating chromosomes could explain the existence of multiple coordinating mechanisms for meiS and DSB formation."

Some mechanistic differences exist, which could be due to the lack of identity of the DSB factors themselves. First, unlike budding yeast, fission yeast lacking the Rad53 homolog Cds1 form DSBs in the presence of HU (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tonami et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ogino and Masai, 2006</a>).

Other mechanistic parallels remain to be tested, in particular, the role of DDK in the pre-meiotic replication checkpoint, which we identified as a central player in coupling DNA replication with DSB formation in budding yeast. The <i>S. pombe</i> Cdc7 homolog Hsk1 is essential for DSB formation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ogino et al., 2006</a>), and is regulated by the pre-mitotic replication checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib43\">Snaith et al., 2000</a>). The close temporal succession of pre-meiotic DNA replication and DSB formation is a universal feature of meiotic recombination, and our data demonstrate that the separation of these two processes is vital for maintaining genomic integrity. Given that both the DDK cell cycle kinase and the replication checkpoint are highly conserved in all eukaryotes, it seems likely that similar coupling mechanisms exist to protect the gametes in other species, including humans."

Whatever the cause, cells that form DSBs on partially replicated chromosomes are unable to complete DSB repair.\u201d All sorts of defects could be occurring in these cells, e.g., defective cohesin function (known to cause HR defects). Maybe DSBs continue to be made \u2013 indeed, DSB levels in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> are 40% higher in <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells. So, additional deregulation is occurring. Moreover, unlike most mutants with DSB repair defects, checkpoint arrest is not robust in these cells. In addition, with respect to viability loss, surely partially replicated chromosomes are a much bigger problem than unrepaired DSBs? The differences in the amount of replication between <i>cdc6-mn</i> and <i>cdc6-mn spo11</i> mutants make it impossible to tease out the relative contributions of DSBs and partial replication to cell death. Therefore, it seems that the specific contribution of DSBs made on partially replicated chromosomes to cell death in <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells is completely unclear."

Maybe a sister chromatid is important for non-crossover formation? We also wondered whether Holliday structures between sister chromatids are detected in <i>cdc6-mn</i>. This is a good control to confirm the replication block in this mutant."

To address this point, we now included viability analysis of <i>dbf4-\u0394N221/DBF4</i> cells. The <i>dbf4-\u0394N221</i> mutation confers a dominant checkpoint bypass (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Thus, use of a heterozygous <i>dbf4-\u0394N221/DBF4</i> strain allowed us to separate the checkpoint function of DBF4from its replication function (as well as other meiotic functions, which appear unaffected in the <i>dbf4-\u0394N221/DBF4</i> strain). As shown in the revised <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <i>dbf4-\u0394N221/DBF4</i> cells exhibit a loss of viability specifically in HU. This loss of viability was entirely dependent on DSB formation, indicating that these mutants form DSBs in HU that are not properly repaired. We therefore concluded that inappropriate DSB formation on replicating chromosomes contributes to the loss of cell viability in checkpoint mutants."

First, as is already obvious from the one-dimensional analysis shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, there are likely several different cell populations; some that repair with essentially wild type kinetics and others that fail to make dHJs. This heterogeneity makes more detailed conclusions difficult without extensive further analysis or additional <i>cdc6</i> alleles. Second, the asynchronous replication intermediates also obscure major recombination intermediates (most notably single-end invasions), which essentially renders the analysis of these intermediates impossible in standard 2D-gel analysis. As this manuscript is primarily a characterization of the meiotic replication checkpoint, we feel that the in-depth analysis that would be necessary to further dissect DSB repair on partially replicated chromosomes is beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, in this manuscript, we state that there are problems in repair but refrain from making further claims about the types of repair that might be affected."

However, we know from the published literature that phosphorylation of Mer2 by DDK is essential for DSB formation, so we can predict that failure to phosphorylate Mer2 would have a significant impact on DSB formation. Similarly, we believe that down-regulating Spo11 significantly improves the DNA replication block experienced by <i>cdc6-mn</i> cells (see point 6 above). It is not currently clear in the field whether Mre11 and Rec114 must be on chromosomes to allow for DSB formation, however this is a likely prediction and prevailing model in the field (see <a href=\"#bib38\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that all three methods of DSB factor regulation described in this study contribute significantly to preventing lethal DSB formation on partially replicated chromosomes. However, we have reworded the Abstract, Results, and Discussion sections of the paper to reflect the point that we cannot formally state that the observed regulation of DSB factors inhibits DSB formation."
