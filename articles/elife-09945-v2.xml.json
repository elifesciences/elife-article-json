For example, errors in specific parts of the mRNA can alter how the whole instruction is edited later, while others might make only a tiny change to the protein encoded by the gene. Carey also found evidence that the instructions encoded by genes may have evolved in such a way to minimise the effect of any errors on their roles in cells."

In contrast, RNA polymerase errors are uniquely positioned to generate phenotypic diversity. Error rates are high (10<sup>-6</sup>\u201310<sup>-5</sup>) <a href=\"#bib7\">(Gout et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lynch, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Shaw et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">de Mercoyrol et al., 1992</a>), and each mRNA molecule is translated into 2000\u20134000 molecules of protein (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schwanh\u00e4usser et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Futcher et al., 1999</a>), resulting in the\u00a0amplification of any errors.

Despite the fact that transient errors can result in altered phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Gordon et al., 2013</a><a href=\"#bib12\">, 2015</a>), the genetics and environmental factors that affect RNA polymerase fidelity are poorly understood. This is because current methods for measuring polymerase fidelity are technically challenging (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gout et al., 2013</a>), require specialized organism-specific genetic constructs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Irvin et al., 2014</a>), and can only measure error rates at specific loci (<a href=\"#bib9\">Imashimizu et al., 2013</a>)."

I find that RNA polymerase errors result in intron retention and that cellular mRNA quality control may reduce the effective RNA polymerase error rate.

Therefore, a major challenge in identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and in measuring changes in polymerase fidelity is the reduction of technical errors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kleinman and Majewski, 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Pickrell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Li et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). First, I map full-length (untrimmed) reads to the genome and discard reads with indels, with more than two mismatches, that map to multiple locations in the genome, and that do not map end\u00a0to\u00a0end along the full length of the read. Next, I trim the ends of the mapped reads, as alignments are of lower quality along the ends, and the mismatch rate is higher, especially at splice junctions. I also discard any cycles within the run with abnormally high error rates, and bases with low Illumina quality scores (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Finally, using the remaining bases, I count the number of matches and mismatches to the reference genome at each position in the genome. I discard positions with identical mismatches that are present more than once, as these are likely due to subclonal DNA polymorphisms or sequences that Illumina miscalls in a systematic manner (<a href=\"#bib27\">Meacham et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The result is a set of mismatches, many of which are technical errors and some of which are RNA polymerase errors. In order to determine if RNA-seq mismatches are due to RNA polymerase errors, it is necessary to identify sequence locations in which RNA polymerase errors are expected to have a measurable effect, or situations in which RNA polymerase fidelity is expected to vary."

Part of these conflicts may result from the fact that the only available assays for RNA polymerase fidelity are special reporter strains that rely on DNA sequences known to increase the frequency of RNA polymerase errors. While I found that RPB9 expression correlates with RNA-seq error rates in mammalian cells, correlation is not causation. Furthermore, differences in RNA levels do not necessitate differences in stoichiometry among the subunits in active Pol II complexes. In order to determine if differential expression of RPB9 or DST1 are causative for differences in RNA polymerase fidelity in\u00a0vivo, I constructed two yeast strains in which I can alter the expression of either RPB9 or DST1 using \u03b2-estradiol and a synthetic transcription factor that has no effect on growth rate or the expression of any other genes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mcisaac et al., 2014</a><a href=\"#bib25\">, 2013</a>). I grew these two strains (Z<sub>3</sub>EV<sub>pr</sub>-RPB9 and Z<sub>3</sub>EV<sub>pr</sub>-DST1) in different concentrations of \u03b2-estradiol and performed RNA-seq. I find that cells expressing low levels of RPB9 have high RNA polymerase error rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Likewise, cells with low DST1 have high error rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). The increase in errors rate is not a property of cells defective for transcription elongation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The increase in error rates due to mutations in Rpb9 and Dst1 have not been robustly measured, however, there are some rough numbers. Here, the measured increase in error rate is 13%, while the measured effect of Rpb9 deletion in\u00a0vitro is fivefold (<a href=\"#bib37\">Walmacq et al., 2009</a>) and in\u00a0vivo following reverse transcription is 30% (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nesser et al., 2006</a>). If 2% of the observed mismatches are due to RNA polymerase errors, a fivefold increase in polymerase error rate results in a 10% increase in measured mismatch frequency; this is consistent with RNA polymerase fidelity of 10<sup>-6</sup>\u201310<sup>-5</sup> and overall RNA-seq error rates of 10<sup>-4</sup>. Note that in our assay cells still express low levels or RPB9, and we therefore expect the increase in error rate to be lower, suggesting that RNA polymerase errors constitute 5\u201310% of the measured mismatches. Our ability to genetically control the expression of DST1 and RPB9, and measure changes in RNA-seq error rates is consistent with MORPhEUS measuring RNA polymerase fidelity. In addition, we observe more single-nucleotide insertions in the RNA-seq data from the high error rate samples, suggesting that depletion of RPB9 and DST1 results in increased insertions in transcripts, but not increased deletions (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Finally, genetic reduction in RNA polymerase fidelity results in increased intron retention, consistent with RNA polymerase errors causing reduced splicing efficiency (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>)."

I asked how altered RPB9 and DST1 expression levels affect each type of single-nucleotide change. I find that, with decreasing polymerase fidelity, transitions increase more than transversions, and that C\u2192U errors are the most common (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). This result, along with other sequencing based results (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gout et al., 2013</a>), have shown that DNA and RNA polymerase have broadly similar error profiles (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>); it will be interesting to see if all polymerases share the same mutation spectra, and if this is due to deamination of the template base, or is a structural property of the polymerase itself. Interestingly, I find that coding sequences have evolved so that errors are less likely to produce in-frame stop codons than out-of-frame stop codons, suggesting that natural selection may act to minimize the effect of polymerase errors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Consistent with previous work in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro, I find that depletion of RPB9 or Dst1 results in higher RNA polymerase error rates. Furthermore, I find that expression of RPB9 negatively correlates with RNA-seq error rates in human cell lines, suggesting that differential expression of RPB9 may regulate RNA polymerase fidelity in\u00a0vivo in humans. In addition, consistent with the errors detected by MORPhEUS being due to RNA polymerase and not technical errors, in reads spanning an exon\u2013intron junction, the measured error rate is higher at the 5\u2019 donor splice site, suggesting that RNA polymerase errors result in intron retention. Because it can be run on existing RNA-seq data, I expect MORPhEUS to enable many future discoveries regarding both the molecular determinants of RNA polymerase error rates and the relationship between RNA polymerase fidelity and phenotype."

In order to bypass alignment, which\u00a0is\u00a0the most computationally expensive step of the pipeline, I developed a method capable of using RNA-seq reads aligned with spliced aligners. First, in order to avoid increased mismatch rates at splice junctions due to alignment problems with both spliced and unspliced reads, I used SAMtools (<a href=\"#bib18\">Li et al., 2009</a>) and awk to remove all alignments that do\u00a0not align along the full length of the genome (e.g., for 76\u00a0bp reads, only reads with a CIGAR flag of 76\u00a0M). The remaining reads weretrimmed (bamUtil, trimBam) to convert the first and last 10\u00a0bp of each read to Ns and set the quality strings to \u2018!\u2019. I then used samtools mpileup (-q30 \u2013C50 \u2013Q30) and custom perl code to count the number of reads and number of errors at each position in genome. Positions with too many errors (e.g., more than one read of the same nonreference base) were not counted."

I then used bedtools (<a href=\"#bib32\">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</a>) (bedtools flank -b 20 -l 0 and bedtools flank -l 20 -b 0) to generate bed files with intervals that contain the splicing donor and acceptor sites, respectively. In addition, I used bedtools getfasta on the +10\u00a0bp flanking bed file to keep only introns flanked by GT and AG donor and acceptor sites. The final result is a pair of bam files with intervals centered on the splicing donor or acceptor sites. I used this new bed file to count error rates around each splice junction. The error rate at each position (e.g., -10, -9, -8, etc. from the G at the 5\u2019 donor site) is the sum of all errors at that position, divided by the sum of all reads. Positions are relative to the splicing feature, not to the genome, as error rates at any single genomic position are dominated by sampling bias. Per mono-, di-, and trinucleotide background error rates were-calculated using the same scripts, but without limiting mpileup to the splice junctions."

                    "text": "In this manuscript, Carey describes a computational method called MORPhEUS that allows measuring RNA polymerase error rates using published RNA-seq data. By counting the number of matches and mismatches to the reference genome after technical errors are minimized, MORPhEUS enables the author to estimate the error rate at each position of the genome. Using chromatin-associated RNA from RNA-seq data in K562 cells, the author calculates error rates at splice site junctions and demonstrates that these are higher at 5` splice sites, suggesting that this could affect intron retention. Using ENCODE RNA-seq data, the author further investigates if the expression level of the Pol II subunit Rpb9, known to be required in Pol II fidelity, affects RNA polymerase error rates in different cell lines. Furthermore, the author measures RNA-seq error rates using two yeast strains in which it is possible to modulate the expression of Rpb9 or Dst1, finding that cells with low expression of Rpb9 or Dst1 possess higher error rates, consistent with known biochemical and genetic data. The idea is intriguing and the explanations for observations in terms of Pol II error rates make sense. The proposed method MORPhEUS is appropriate to perform comparative analysis of RNApol induced transcription errors between two or more samples or to identify RNApol errors leading to intron retention. Other than currently available methods this approach is able to identify errors transcriptome-wide and does not \"require specialised organism-specific genetic constructs\", therefore it seems to be highly useful. The method presented here is interesting and it is a valuable tool for estimating RNA Pol II error rates from RNA-seq data, although several points need to be addressed before publication can be considered."

The analysis of these motifs should confirm the interpretation by the author. Because this data is not shown, does that mean no elevated signal has been observed? How can this be explained in the light of the author's interpretation of Pol II errors at splicing motifs leading to retained introns? Since the only position with elevated error rate seems to be the U at the 5' SS, an alternative explanation (probably not the only possible one) could be that some factor strongly binds to the uracil in such a way that the reverse transcription in the RNA-seq protocol causes the uracil to be misread.

The error rates observed around 5' splice sites are normalized by the error rates seen for the same dinucleotides, GT, at other places in the transcriptome. The 4-fold elevated error rate therefore depends on the null model. It would be important to compute the relative error rate at the uracil with more refined trimer null models to see if the 4-fold increase holds up. Two versions, one with the mutated nucleotide at the first position and another model with the mutated nucleotide at the last of the three trimer positions, should be used. The latter version could model sequence-dependent effects during reverse transcription. For each trimer in the transcriptome one can compute the error rate at the first and third nucleotide. Then, the total mutations for each position around the 5' splice site (and the 3' splice site and branch point) are divided by expected numbers of mutations, which is simply the sum of error rates for each of the trimer contexts for the position."

An alternative explanation for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> would be that changing Rpb9 and TFIIS concentration from its finely regulated value impairs elongation, which in turn can influence splicing rates and splicing efficiency.

Positions with high coverage are much more likely to have the same 'real' RNApol error twice, than positions with low coverage. (This seems to be so obvious that we might have overlooked the explanation of the normalization procedure)\u2013 RNA polymerase errors seem to be biased to e.g. C-&gt;T (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), making it quite a bit more likely to see exactly the same RNApol error twice at a position for C-&gt;T/G-&gt;A.In general the uncertainty of RNApol error estimates at low coverage positions (i.e. lowly expressed genes) should be much worse than for high coverage (highly expressed genes). Is this addressed in the algorithm? (Maybe this problem has been discussed but missed by reviewers.) If not it needs some clarification, how different depth-of-coverage and mutation bias is considered when estimating the errors or removing mismatches of the same type.</i>"
