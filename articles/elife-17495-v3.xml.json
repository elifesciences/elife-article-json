Amino acids are a class of nutrients that are vital for the growth and function of an organism. Here, we report a neuronal circuit that allows <i>Drosophila</i> larvae to overcome amino acid deprivation and pupariate. We find that nutrient stress is sensed by the class IV multidendritic cholinergic neurons. Through live calcium imaging experiments, we show that these cholinergic stimuli are conveyed to glutamatergic neurons in the ventral ganglion through mAChR. We further show that IP<sub>3</sub>R-dependent calcium transients in the glutamatergic neurons convey this signal to downstream medial neurosecretory cells (mNSCs). The circuit ultimately converges at the ring gland and regulates expression of ecdysteroid biosynthetic genes. Activity in this circuit is thus likely to be an adaptation that provides a layer of regulation to help surpass nutritional stress during development."

Amino acids are a class of nutrients that are vital for the growth and function of an organism. Here, we report a neuronal circuit that allows <i>Drosophila</i> larvae to overcome amino acid deprivation and pupariate. We find that nutrient stress is sensed by the class IV multidendritic cholinergic neurons. Through live calcium imaging experiments, we show that these cholinergic stimuli are conveyed to glutamatergic neurons in the ventral ganglion through mAChR. We further show that IP<sub>3</sub>R-dependent calcium transients in the glutamatergic neurons convey this signal to downstream medial neurosecretory cells (mNSCs). The circuit ultimately converges at the ring gland and regulates expression of ecdysteroid biosynthetic genes. Activity in this circuit is thus likely to be an adaptation that provides a layer of regulation to help surpass nutritional stress during development."

Jayakumar et al. showed that food that is deficient in nutrients triggers some larval neurons to release a chemical called acetylcholine, which in turn activates receptors on certain other neurons that communicate using the signalling molecule glutamate. In normal insects, this causes the glutamate-producing neurons to release calcium ions through their IP<sub>3</sub>R channels. The calcium ions then activate a chain of events that ultimately causes other cells to produce a hormone called ecdysone, which drives the transformation from larva to pupa. In IP<sub>3</sub>R mutants, by contrast, the absence of calcium ion release keeps the insect in the larval stage."

To combat these lean periods, physiological mechanisms have evolved that are common to both vertebrates and invertebrates (<a href=\"#bib70\">Waterson and Horvath, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>). Such mechanisms require the animal to integrate sensory perception of nutrient deprivation with appropriate metabolic changes. The nervous system plays a central role in this process, and communication between multiple neuronal cell types can regulate the necessary metabolic and hormonal changes required for coordinating an organismal response (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chantranupong et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Waterson and Horvath, 2015</a>). The vertebrate hindbrain acts as a central regulator of energy balance. Nuclei of the solitary tract integrate energy status signals from relevant inputs such as blood-borne endocrine signals and synaptic signals from the gastrointestinal tract and peripheral neurons, to modulate appetite and feeding (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grill and Hayes, 2012</a>). However, the specific identity and circuitry of neurons responsible for sensing and responding to nutritional cues is not completely understood. This is in part due to the complexity of the vertebrate brain, in which monitoring activity in specific neuronal subtypes is challenging. A less-complex nervous system, consisting of approximately 10,000 neurons (<a href=\"#bib49\">Scott et al., 2001</a>), compared with 70 million neurons in the mouse brain (<a href=\"#bib17\">Economo et al., 2016</a>), makes <i>Drosophila</i> larvae a powerful system to elucidate central brain circuitry underlying systemic responses to nutrient deprivation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bjordal et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "Intracellular signaling mechanisms shape neural responses across circuits and contribute greatly to systemic outcome. For example, ghrelin, a gut-derived orexigenic hormone, affects synaptic plasticity under conditions of nutrient deprivation through intracellular signaling involving calcium (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). Nonetheless, intracellular signaling pathways responsible for synaptic plasticity in circuits that regulate organismal responses to an altered nutrient status need further elucidation. Intracellular calcium signaling evolved in parallel with multi-cellularity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cai, 2008</a>), and may therefore function in coordinating systemic metabolic responses (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chantranupong et al., 2015</a>) of metazoans. A key component of intracellular calcium signaling is the Inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R). These are calcium channels that mediate intracellular calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in response to extracellular stimuli (<a href=\"#bib55\">Streb et al., 1983</a>). In vertebrates, calcium release through IP<sub>3</sub>R2 and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 is required in various classes of non-excitable cells for metabolic control (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>) and exocrine secretion of insulin or amylase from the pancreas (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berggren et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Futatsugi et al., 2005</a>). IP<sub>3</sub>R1 is expressed in different classes of neurons where it regulates processes ranging from synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nishiyama et al., 2000</a>) to axonal guidance (<a href=\"#bib71\">Xiang et al., 2002</a>). Due to the broad expression of most components of metazoan intracellular signaling, including the IP<sub>3</sub>R family, identifying cell-specific function in vivo can be challenging. <i>Drosophila</i> genetics provides the tools for such cell-specific analysis."

While null alleles are lethal as second instar larvae, heteroallelic hypomorphs exhibit developmental and metabolic phenotypes. These range from lethality across larval stages to hyperphagic adults with altered lipid metabolism. The focus of adult metabolic defects observed in <i>itpr</i> mutants appears to be the central nervous system (<a href=\"#bib56\">Subramanian et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2013b</a>). For a better understanding of neuronal IP<sub>3</sub>R function in the context of metabolic regulation, we chose to study the <i>Drosophila</i> larval to pupal transition. This transition requires systemic integration of the nutritional state of late-stage larvae with release of hormones that drive pupariation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andersen et al., 2013</a>). Here, we identify a neural circuit that allows <i>Drosophila</i> larvae to overcome chronic protein-deprivation and pupariate. We demonstrate that nutrient sensitive plasticity of this circuit requires intracellular calcium signaling in newly identified glutamatergic neurons of the ventral ganglion."

At 120 hr post transfer, wild-type larvae exhibited complete pupariation on either ND or PDD, whereas <i>itpr</i> mutant larvae exhibited a decrease in pupariation on ND which was worsened significantly on PDD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Pupariation in wild-type larvae was delayed slightly when subjected to PDD, whereas <i>itpr</i> mutants, which barely pupate on PDD, were delayed considerably even on a normal diet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C,D and E</a>). Protein is the likely nutritional cue necessary for pupariation by <i>itpr</i> mutants, because the extent of pupariation on a lipid-deprived diet was significantly higher than on PDD and closer to pupariation on a normal diet (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Moreover, pupariation in <i>itpr</i> mutants was restored when the PDD was supplemented with amino acids and vitamins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Interestingly, <i>itpr</i> mutant larvae feed in excess of controls (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), but their body weights are similar to that of wild-type larvae at the time of transfer to the PDD, indicating that excess feeding may be an attempt to compensate for metabolic changes due to altered intracellular calcium signaling (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Pan-neuronal restoration of <i>itpr</i> function in the mutant by expressing wild-type <i>itpr</i> cDNA (<i>itpr<sup>+</sup></i>) with <i>elav-GAL4</i> rescued the pupariation deficit, whereas pan-neuronal knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R mimicked the <i>itpr</i> mutant phenotype on PDD, while exhibiting complete pupariation on ND (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,C,D and E</a>).

                                "text": "To identify neuronal subsets that require <i>itpr</i> function for pupariation in protein-deprived conditions, IP<sub>3</sub>R knockdown was performed in various neuronal subsets. Among the tested subsets, the strongest pupariation deficit was observed upon IP<sub>3</sub>R knockdown in glutamatergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Peptidergic neurons also showed a significant pupariation deficit, but this effect was not diet specific (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and Table 2). Interestingly, when pan-neuronal knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R was restricted to the brain lobes by introducing <i>tsh-GAL80,</i> pupariation was restored from less than 25% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) to more than 75% (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These data indicate that IP<sub>3</sub>R function is required to a greater extent in neurons located in the ventral ganglion for pupariation on PDD as compared with neurons located in the central brain lobes. We therefore used two independent <i>GAL4</i> strains, <i>vglut<sup>VGN6341</sup></i> and <i>vglut<sup>VGN9281(2)</sup></i> (subsequently referred to as <i>VGN6341</i> and <i>VGN9281-2</i>), with contrasting expression patterns within the glutamatergic population of the ventral ganglion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), to delimit the subpopulation required for pupariation on PDD. The <i>VGN6341</i> and <i>VGN9281-2</i> strains differ in their expression patterns especially in the third thoracic and initial abdominal segments of the ventral ganglion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). IP<sub>3</sub>R knockdown with <i>VGN6341</i> resulted in significantly reduced pupariation on PDD, whereas larvae with IP<sub>3</sub>R knockdown in <i>VGN9281-2</i>-expressing cells pupariated similar to control larvae (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Normal pupariation was observed when IP<sub>3</sub>R knockdown was restricted by introducing <i>tsh-GAL80</i> in the background of <i>VGN6341</i> (referred to as restricted <i>VGN6341</i>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). <i>tsh-GAL80</i> restricted expression of <i>VGN6341</i>, to the central brain and a few neurons in the ventral ganglion. In a complementary experiment, pupariation in the <i>itpr</i> mutant was restored by expression of <i>UAS-itpr<sup>+</sup></i> in <i>VGN6341</i> expressing neurons but not with the GAL80-restricted <i>VGN6341</i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Comparison of <i>VGN9281-2</i> and <i>VGN6341</i> expression with and without <i>tsh-GAL80</i> pointed to a region between the third thoracic and fifth abdominal segments in the ventral ganglion, subsequently designated as the mid-ventral ganglion or mVG, where IP<sub>3</sub>R function is required for pupariation on PDD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These <i>VGN6341-</i>expressing cells were confirmed as glutamatergic by co-immunostaining of <i>VGN6341</i> driven GFP with DvGlut, an established marker of glutamatergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib13\">Daniels et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Although a role for peripheral glutamatergic neurons of the mVG remains possible, we focussed on the central ones as they were more easily and repeatedly identifiable."

Twelve GPCRs identified in the screen (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) were validated as functioning upstream of the IP<sub>3</sub>R, by rescue of pupariation with two components of the IP<sub>3</sub> signaling pathway, a constitutively active G\u03b1q transgene <i>AcGq</i> and <i>dSTIM</i> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Among the identified GPCRs, we tested further the role of the muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor (Flybase <i>mAChR-A, mAChR-60C, CG4356</i> and henceforth, mAChR) in pupariation. The mAChR activates Gq/PLC\u03b2 signaling leading to IP<sub>3</sub> production and IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in <i>Drosophila</i> cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Millar et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Srikanth et al., 2006</a>). Knockdown of the <i>mAChR</i> in glutamatergic neurons of the ventral ganglion significantly reduced pupariation on protein-deficient media and expression of the <i>mAChR<sup>+</sup> </i>transgene in the same neuronal subset in the <i>itpr</i> mutant rescued pupariation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These data support mAChR stimulation followed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the IP<sub>3</sub>R as a mechanism required by glutamatergic neurons of the mVG for pupariation under conditions of nutrient stress."

                                "text": "Next we assessed the response of <i>VGN6341-</i>expressing neurons in the mVG to carbamylcholine (CCh), an mAChR agonist (<a href=\"#bib41\">Offermanns et al., 1994</a>). We measured CCh responses in ex vivo preparations of third-instar larval brains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) that were subjected to either ND or PDD for 18 hr, by <i>VGN6341-</i>driven expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator <i>GCaMP6m</i>. Upon stimulation with CCh, calcium transients were observed in multiple <i>VGN6341</i> marked cells from larvae fed on a normal diet (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). The specificity of this response was ascertained by pre-incubation with atropine, an established and specific antagonist of the mAChR (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fryer and Maclagan, 1984</a>), which abolished the response (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). Not surprisingly, the response to CCh was significantly attenuated in <i>itpr</i> mutants on a normal diet (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). On PDD, the response to CCh was reduced in neurons from control larvae, and it was nearly absent in neurons from <i>itpr</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E,F and G</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). To assess whether there was a temporal component to these responses, we measured responses at either 2\u00a0hr or 18\u00a0hr on NDD and PDD. In control larvae, the CCh response of glutamatergic neurons reduced significantly from 2 hr to 18 hr on PDD (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). The strongly attenuated CCh response observed in <i>itpr</i> mutants at 18 hr on PDD was not evident at 2 hr on PDD (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). These data indicate that a physiological change in the mVG glutamatergic neurons happens on PDD over time. The change in response to CCh over time was not evident on ND in either control or <i>itpr</i> mutant neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Importantly, the response of glutamatergic neurons in <i>itpr</i> mutants could be rescued by supplementing PDD with essential amino acids (EAA) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Thus, loss of dietary EAA appears to be a cause for abrogation of the CCh response in <i>itpr</i> mutant glutamatergic neurons after 18 hr on PDD. The response to CCh was also absent in glutamatergic neurons of the mVG with knockdown of either <i>mAChR</i> or <i>itpr</i> on ND (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) and PDD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F,G</a>). The absence of the CCh response on ND in <i>itpr</i> and <i>mAChR</i> knockdowns, even though validating the original response to be through the IP<sub>3</sub>R, did not correlate with a defect in pupariation (Table 2), suggesting that mAChR and IP<sub>3</sub>R function in mVG neurons is critically required on PDD but not relevant on ND (see discussion). The response to CCh on PDD was rescued to a significant extent by over-expression of either <i>mAChR<sup>+</sup></i> or <i>itpr<sup>+</sup></i> in <i>VGN6341-</i>marked neurons of <i>itpr</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F and G</a>), and correlated with rescue of pupariation observed in these genotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A</a>). These data suggest that cholinergic inputs convey protein-starvation to <i>VGN6341-</i>marked glutamatergic neurons possibly through acetylcholine, that activate mAChR and the IP<sub>3</sub>R for pupariation."

The same experiment performed either with larvae on ND or with larvae on PDD but at the permissive temperature (22\u00b0C) supported pupariation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2F and H</a>). When <i>Shi<sup>ts</sup></i> expression was driven by a combination of <i>ChaT-GAL4</i> and <i>ppk-GAL80</i> (blocking GAL4 activity in multidendritic sensory neurons), normal pupariation was observed on the protein-deficient diet (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2G and H</a>), suggesting the requirement of neurons expressing the Pickpocket (ppk) channel (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 1998</a>) in sensing protein-deficient conditions prior to pupariation. This idea was tested directly by expression of <i>Shi<sup>ts</sup></i> or a hyperpolarising potassium channel Kir2.1 in neurons expressing Pickpocket (<i>ppk-GAL4</i>), both of which caused a severe pupariation deficit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>). Pupariation was restored in these animals by supplementing the protein-deficient diet with a mixture of EAA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Activity in <i>ppk-GAL4</i>-marked neurons is thus required for pupariation on PDD but not on ND. In contrast, pupariation was unaffected when activity was inhibited in cholinergic neurons marked by <i>19-12-GAL4</i> expression, which does not overlap with <i>ppk-GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2G and H</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yan et al., 2013</a>)."

GRASP signals between <i>VGN6341-</i> and <i>ppk-</i>marked neurons were detected in the neuropil of the ventral ganglion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>), which is a synaptically dense region along the midline. GRASP constructs expressing the split GFP components individually with either <i>ppk-GAL4</i> or <i>VGN6341-LexA</i> had no GFP expression (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A and B</a>). To test if the observed connections are functional, cholinergic neurons were marked by <i>ChaT-LexA</i> and optogenetically activated with a red-shifted channelrhodopsin variant, <i>LexAop-CsChrimson</i>. Calcium transients were observed in glutamatergic cells of the mVG simultaneously with optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons on either ND or PDD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). On PDD, interestingly, the transients appeared to oscillate. As a control, we tested optogenetic activation of aminergic neurons (marked by <i>HL9-LexA</i>). This did not elicit a response in glutamatergic neurons of the mVG (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). To confirm that activation of VGN6341 neurons was through inputs from ppk neurons, we performed an optogenetic activation experiment with <i>TrpA1-QF</i> which marks class IV multidendritic neurons (<a href=\"#bib44\">Petersen and Stowers, 2011</a>; subsequently referred to as <i>ppk-QF</i>). A robust activation of <i>VGN6341</i>-marked cells expressing the red shifted calcium indicator jRCaMP1b was observed upon optogenetic activation of ppk neurons expressing <i>QUAS-ChR2</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R in cholinergic neurons did not change pupariation on PDD (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and restoring IP<sub>3</sub>R function in cholinergic neurons failed to rescue the <i>itpr</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2I</a>). As normal pupariation was observed in animals with cholinergic knockdown of the IP<sub>3</sub>R on PDD, we did not test cholinergic stimulation of glutamatergic neurons in IP<sub>3</sub>R mutants. Instead, to understand the basis of the pupariation defect on PDD, we investigated next the postsynaptic partners of glutamatergic neurons marked by <i>VGN6341-GAL4</i>."

The ensuing GRASP presented a complex pattern comprising medial Neurosecretory Cells (mNSCs) in the central brain, multiple projections between the mVGs and the mNSCs, and a few cell bodies and projections in the periphery of the ventral ganglion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Controls with either GAL4 or LexA driving individual GRASP constructs elicited no GFP immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). To test the functional significance of this apparent connectivity between peptidergic and glutamatergic cells, we measured pupariation on PDD after knockdown of various glutamatergic receptors in <i>dimm</i>-positive neurons. Amongst the five receptors tested, pupariation was reduced significantly in animals with knockdown of the metabotropic glutamate receptor A (mGluR<sub>A</sub>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Knockdown of <i>mGluR<sub>A</sub></i> with two independent RNAi strains showed differing but significant deficits in pupariation (10% and 40%; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We attribute this difference to the strength of the RNAi knockdown in peptidergic cells from the two different RNAi strains. Knockdown of other glutamate receptor classes resulted in normal pupariation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Restriction of <i>mGluR<sub>A</sub></i> knockdown in peptidergic neurons of the central brain and in Dilp2-positive mNSCs (<i>Dilp2-GAL4)</i> also resulted in pupariation deficits on PDD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast, normal pupariation was observed by restricting knockdown of IP<sub>3</sub>R to <i>VGN6341-</i>marked glutamatergic neurons of the central brain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Taken together these data support the innervation of central brain peptidergic neurons, specifically the mNSCs, by glutamatergic neurons of the ventral ganglion. This innervation appears relevant for pupariation on PDD."

Upon co-immunostaining with an antibody against Dilp2 (<a href=\"#bib23\">G\u00e9minard et al., 2009</a>), five of the seven Dilp2-positive cells in the mNSCs were 'GRASPed' by <i>VGN6341</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) as suggested earlier by immunostaining of mVG cells and the mNSCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The presence of dendritic fields close to the mNSC soma has been described earlier (<a href=\"#bib39\">N\u00e4ssel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Vallejo et al., 2015</a>) and was confirmed by simultaneous expression of an axonal and a dendritic marker with <i>Dilp2-GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, axonal projections from <i>VGN6341</i>-marked glutamatergic neurons probably stimulate a subset of mNSCs. The presence of functional synaptic connections between <i>VGN6341-GAL4</i> and mNSCs was tested next. <i>CsChrimson</i>-expressing <i>VGN6341</i> cells were optogenetically activated in ex\u00a0vivo preparations in which <i>GCaMP6m</i> was expressed in peptidergic cells, including the mNSCs, marked by <i>dimm-LexA::p65</i>. Upon optogenetic stimulation of <i>CsChrimson</i> in <i>VGN6341</i> marked neurons calcium transients were observed in the mNSCs of larvae from both normal and protein-deficient diets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F,G and H</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Similar activation of the mNSCs was obtained when <i>VGN6341</i> marked neurons were thermogenically activated with <i>dTrpA1</i>, a temperature-activated cation channel (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C and E</a>).

The underlying basis for this defect appears to be an inability of the <i>VGN6341-</i>marked neurons to stimulate the mNSCs in <i>itpr</i> mutants, because their optogenetic self-activation evoked robust calcium transients in <i>itpr</i> mutants on ND and PDD (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement F and G</a>). Activation of the Restricted <i>VGN6341-GAL4,</i> where GAL4 expression is absent from the mVG region, did not elicit a signal from the mNSCs (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

Taken together, these results suggest that glutamatergic interneurons in the larval mVG receive cholinergic signals indicating absence of dietary amino acids, process these signals in an IP<sub>3</sub>R-dependent manner, and convey this information to peptidergic cells in the mNSCs for mounting a suitable physiological response to enable pupariation."

For this purpose, an ex vivo preparation was taken in which cells marked by <i>dimm-LexA::p65</i> expressed the rat atrial natriuretic peptide fused with GFP (ANF::GFP) under LexAop control. Peptide release in <i>Drosophila</i> neurons has been studied previously by measuring release of <i>ANF::GFP</i> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Shakiryanova et al., 2006</a>). Upon stimulation with 50\u00a0\u00b5M CCh, a decay in GFP fluorescence was observed in the mNSCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Application of saline did not show a change in fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The extent of release observed was higher in brains from larvae on PDD as compared to larvae on ND (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Release of ANF::GFP was significantly attenuated in mNSCs of the <i>itpr</i> mutant and importantly, this could be rescued by expressing <i>mAChR</i><sup>+</sup> in glutamatergic neurons marked by <i>VGN6341</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C and F</a>). Moreover, peptide release from the mNSCs was reduced significantly upon knockdown of <i>mAChR</i> in <i>VGN6341-</i>marked glutamatergic neurons and not by direct knockdown of <i>mAChR</i> in peptidergic neurons with <i>dimm-GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Thus, cholinergic stimulation of glutamatergic neurons in the mVG appears to regulate peptide release from the mNSCs by activating mGluR<sub>A</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Further support for the ability of glutamatergic neurons to stimulate peptidergic release from the mNSCs comes from optogenetic stimulation of <i>VGN6341-</i>marked glutamatergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Enhanced release of ANF::GFP was observed during the period of optogenetic stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Conversely, acute optogenetic inhibition of <i>VGN6341-</i>marked glutamatergic neurons using halorhodopsin, a light-activated chloride pump known to hyperpolarize neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berni et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Inada et al., 2011</a>), during CCh stimulation inhibited peptide release from mNSCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and I</a>)."

Therefore, we measured Dilp2 levels in the mNSCs of larvae subjected to either normal or protein-deficient diets before and after subjecting them to CCh stimulation for 30 min. Dilp2 levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry using a previously validated antibody (<a href=\"#bib23\">G\u00e9minard et al., 2009</a>). Significant release of Dilp2 was observed post-CCh stimulation, as interpreted from the reduced staining observed in wild-type mNSCs of larvae on ND and PDD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). In the <i>itpr</i> mutant, however, CCh-stimulated Dilp2 release was significantly lower, irrespective of the diets (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a>). CCh stimulation of brains with <i>itpr</i> knockdown in neurons marked by <i>VGN6341</i> also induced weaker release of Dilp2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Taking these observations forward, when <i>Dilp2<sup>+</sup></i>was over-expressed using <i>Dilp2-GAL4</i>, or when <i>Dilp2</i> positive neurons were maintained in an excitable state by expression of NaChBac, a partial rescue of pupariation in the <i>itpr</i> mutant was observed on PDD (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that pupariation on a protein-deficient diet requires mVG-mediated neuropeptide release from the mNSCs. Alternately, or in parallel, pupariation on PDD might require up-regulation of Dilp2 synthesis in the mNSCs, triggered by mGluR<sub>A</sub> signaling. However this seems unlikely because <i>Dilp2</i> mRNA levels are reduced to equal extents upon starvation in both wild-type and <i>itpr</i> mutant brains (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Transcripts for all these genes peaked approximately 42 hr post protein-deprivation in wild-type larvae aged 80\u201388 hr AEL (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The expression levels of these genes were lower in the <i>itpr</i> mutant at 42\u00a0hr and 66\u00a0hr and could be significantly rescued by overexpression of <i>mAChR<sup>+</sup></i>in the neurons marked by <i>VGN6341,</i> especially at 66\u00a0hr (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Their up-regulation corresponded to a rescue in pupariation as well (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Taken together these data indicate that glutamatergic neurons of the mVG regulate expression of genes required for the ecdysone peak for pupariation on PDD in a <i>mAChR-</i> and <i>itpr-</i>dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C and D</a>). Ecdysteroid synthesis and release is regulated by neuropeptides, predominantly prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) (<a href=\"#bib32\">McBrayer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mirth et al., 2005</a>), as well as through insulin signaling (<a href=\"#bib12\">Colombani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mirth et al., 2005</a>). We propose that this regulation of ecdysone synthesis by the mVG is through neuropeptide release from the mNSCs."

These mVG neurons require mAChR-stimulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the IP<sub>3</sub>R to signal to downstream peptidergic neurons, including the medial neurosecretory cells. On a protein-deficient diet, these connections stimulate release of neuropeptides, which in turn, regulate expression of genes required for ecdysteroid biosynthesis to allow pupariation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Calcium responses of mVG glutamatergic neurons differ between the normal and protein-deficient diets, suggesting that nutrient-dependent changes take place in these neurons that affect their cellular signaling properties. Knockdown of either <i>mAChR</i> or <i>itpr</i> in the mVG neurons blocks the functional connectivity between these neurons and the mNSCs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). The loss of this connectivity affects neuropeptide release from the mNSCs that is required for pupariation under protein-deprivation. Glutamatergic signals from the mVG are apparently not essential for pupariation on a normal diet, indicating that the likely function of this circuit is an adaptation to uncertain availability of food in nature."

Feeding and nutrient sensing thus constitute important aspects of larval life. The glutamatergic interneurons identified here exhibit diet-induced plasticity in their response to carbachol, an acetylcholine mimic. Their response appears integral to circuit function, and very likely drives enhanced neuropeptide secretion from the mNSCs and modulates ecdysteroid synthesis in the ring gland. Unlike the central neurons described recently (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bjordal et al., 2014</a>), the glutamatergic interneurons do not sense amino acid levels directly. Instead, they reside in the ventral ganglion and receive inputs from sensory neurons of the class-IV multidendritic type marked by the <i>ppk-GAL4</i>. The precise identity of ppk-positive cells that sense the lack of amino acids needs to be determined."

There is thus a remarkable similarity in the nutrient-sensing circuit we describe here to the circuits proposed in mammals. In vertebrates, neuronal circuit perturbation involving peripheral and central circuits remains challenging.

Intracellular calcium signaling in the context of neuronal regulation of a systemic response to nutritional cues as described here, remains to be tested in vertebrates.

The absence of up-regulation of <i>dilp2</i> transcripts in IP<sub>3</sub>R mutants supports this idea (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is, to our knowledge, the first report of Dilp2 regulation by neurons in the ventral ganglion. Environmental nutrients regulating Dilp function has been well documented (<a href=\"#bib23\">G\u00e9minard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim and Neufeld, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</a>).

Such complex layers of modulation are not surprising given that insulin signaling is important in different aspects of development and growth in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Colombani et al., 2005</a>). The Dilps have been speculated as regulators of pupariation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koyama et al., 2014</a>), and Dilp neurons project to the ring gland where ecdysone production occurs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cao and Brown, 2001</a>). Further work will be required to understand the regulation of Dilp secretion as a balance between neuronal and fat body signaling.

Ecdysone is the switch for developmental change, hence needs to be tightly regulated through transcriptional control of ecdysteroid genes (<a href=\"#bib32\">McBrayer et al., 2007</a>) and ecdysteroid biosynthesis is reported to be influenced by environmental conditions (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shimada-Niwa and Niwa, 2014</a>).

Our results do not rule out connectivity between mVG neurons and the supra-oesophageal ganglion in the central brain that could additionally stimulate the ring gland. We propose that the circuit identified here functions as a further layer of regulation, required during either sudden starvation or nutrient deprivation. It is required to make the key developmental decision of whether and when to pupariate. Energy homeostasis at a systemic level involves integrating environmental cues with internal states. The circuit we describe is such an integrator."

Jayakumar and colleagues describe a neuronal circuit linking class IV multidendritic neurons to peptidergic median neurosecretory neurons (mNSCs) via glutamatergic neurons. Importantly, they show that the functioning of this circuit depends on IP3R-dependent calcium signalling, and present a link to ecdysteroid signalling that is timing pupariation. The finding and characterisation of a neuronal circuit designated to overcome nutrient stress to enable developmental transitions is certainly a major achievement, and will be of interest to many."
