Deformation-based morphometry and independent component analysis identified PD-specific atrophy in the midbrain, basal ganglia, basal forebrain, medial temporal lobe, and discrete cortical regions. The degree of atrophy reflected clinical measures of disease severity. The spatial pattern of atrophy demonstrated overlap with intrinsic networks present in healthy brain, as derived from functional MRI. Moreover, the degree of atrophy in each brain region reflected its functional and anatomical proximity to a presumed disease epicenter in the substantia nigra, compatible with a trans-neuronal spread of the disease. These results support a network-spread mechanism in PD. Finally, the atrophy pattern in PD was also seen in healthy aging, where it also correlated with the loss of striatal dopaminergic innervation."

Deformation-based morphometry and independent component analysis identified PD-specific atrophy in the midbrain, basal ganglia, basal forebrain, medial temporal lobe, and discrete cortical regions. The degree of atrophy reflected clinical measures of disease severity. The spatial pattern of atrophy demonstrated overlap with intrinsic networks present in healthy brain, as derived from functional MRI. Moreover, the degree of atrophy in each brain region reflected its functional and anatomical proximity to a presumed disease epicenter in the substantia nigra, compatible with a trans-neuronal spread of the disease. These results support a network-spread mechanism in PD. Finally, the atrophy pattern in PD was also seen in healthy aging, where it also correlated with the loss of striatal dopaminergic innervation."

Comparing these scans to those from age-matched healthy individuals allowed Zeighami et al. to identify the set of brain regions that show atrophy in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. These regions correspond to a normal brain network, and the relative extent of atrophy in each brain region supports the theory that the disease spreads through the connectome."

Its clinical hallmarks are due to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (SN); however, post-mortem studies have shown that PD pathology affects several other brain areas (<a href=\"#bib35\">Goedert et al., 2013</a>). Surprisingly, however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have failed to consistently demonstrate regional brain atrophy at least in the earlier stages of the disease. This is possibly due to studies consisting mostly of small numbers of subjects from single centers and the use of methodological tools that are relatively insensitive to subcortical atrophy, coupled with univariate methods that suffer from lack of statistical power."

More generally, the network-spread hypothesis suggests that all neurodegenerative diseases target spatially distributed intrinsic brain networks (<a href=\"#bib71\">Warren et al., 2013</a>). At a molecular level, neurodegenerative diseases are now thought to involve prion-like spread of toxic misfolded protein aggregates (<a href=\"#bib34\">Frost and Diamond, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jucker and Walker, 2013</a>). Alpha-synuclein fibrils, implicated in PD pathogenesis, have recently been shown to spread from cell to cell via neuronal pathways after inoculation in mouse brain (<a href=\"#bib48\">Luk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Masuda-Suzukake et al., 2013</a>)."

Intrinsic networks have also been thought to be potential targets for AD since the earliest reports of default mode network dysfunction in the disease (<a href=\"#bib37\">Greicius et al., 2004</a>), and analysis of large MRI data sets in AD and other dementias have supported the network-vulnerability hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib62\">Seeley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Raj et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>); however, it has yet to be tested in PD.

To further investigate the model of disease propagation through brain networks, we used resting state functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) of healthy subjects to define the normal brain connectome and determined whether the pattern of atrophy in PD was compatible with spread via this network from a presumed disease epicenter in the SN."

It is a measure of the change in the shape of each voxel that results from applying non-linear spatial normalization of the entire brain to a standard template (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aubert-Broche et al., 2013</a>). For each subject, we obtained one parametric image of MRI-determined voxel-wise difference in volume, compared to the template brain. ICA was conducted on these DBM images using FSL MELODIC software (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beckmann and Smith, 2004</a>). No constraint was imposed on the number of components, and probabilistic ICA estimated 30 independent components of deformation in the PPMI data set (PD patients and controls combined).

In three of these, there was a positive correlation between the component expression and age (meaning increased volume with age) and all three consisted of ventricle or cerebrospinal fluid space enlargement (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The other seven age-related components demonstrated a negative correlation (volume loss with age) and consisted of areas of gray or white matter (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Connectivity between any region and the presumed disease epicenter will determine how severely it is affected. Here, we evaluated this assumption by exploring whether the gray matter atrophy patterns observed in PD patients could be explained by functional and geodesic distance (i.e., the number of edges separating two nodes in a graph) to the hypothetical pathogenic epicenter. We chose to use the SN as the epicenter based on known PD pathology. Note that the SN is unlikely to be the first affected site in the central nervous system (CNS) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Braak et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2004</a>); however, we postulate that it is likely to function as a source for propagation to the supratentorial brain. Network connectivity in health can be defined functionally, using rsfMRI, or structurally, using DW-MRI. The influence of disease on each node can be estimated from the statistical difference in deformation between PD and control groups. We parcellated the brain into 112 regions of interest (ROIs, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and computed the degree of deformation in each region. We also generated two connectomes from these ROI using rsfMRI and DW-MRI data from two different pools of healthy subjects. The connection strength between each pair of regions was computed as described in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019."

We repeated the same analysis controlling for spatial proximity between each region and SN by entering Euclidean distance as a covariate. The correlation was unchanged (r = 0.38, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that the relationship cannot be explained by spatial proximity. The correlation implies that higher functional connection between a given region and SN is related to higher PD-related atrophy in that region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). When using an anatomical measure of connectivity (DW-MRI) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we also observed a significant relationship between the level of atrophy of each region and its geodesic distance to the SN (r = \u22120.28, p &lt; 0.003). These results were not different after controlling for Euclidean distance to SN (r = \u22120.25, p &lt; 0.005). Finally, we repeated this analysis using every ROI as a potential disease propagator and found that SN was the likeliest disease propagator when using the rsfMRI connectome (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). However, the red nucleus (r = 0.28) and subthalamic nucleus (r = 0.28) were also identified as potential propagators. Repeating this analysis using a tractography-derived connectome also revealed that the SN was one of the likeliest propagators, but numerous cerebellar regions also emerged as potential propagators (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). This may be due to difficulty in accurate identification of the targets of brainstem white matter tracts using DW-MRI (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ford et al., 2013</a>)."

Patients included in this study were diagnosed on average 7 months prior to the investigation and had no evidence of dementia (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Most MRI studies to date using T1-weighted images in PD have reported normal volumes of brainstem, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. In the SN, measurements of volume and shape have been inconclusive, reporting either no change, a decrease, or increase in volume depending on the method used (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pyatigorskaya et al., 2014</a>). However, most studies using parametric mapping have failed to report a difference in SN. Reduced putamen or caudate volume has been reported but only in advanced cases with mild cognitive impairment or dementia (<a href=\"#bib1\">Apostolova et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Silbert and Kaye, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pyatigorskaya et al., 2014</a>).

With regard to cortical areas, studies using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), DBM, or cortical thickness measurements have reported significant differences between PD and controls in parahippocampal gyrus, inferior, middle and frontal temporal gyrus, parietal lobe and occipital lobe, but, once again, typically in advanced patients with cognitive impairment (<a href=\"#bib63\">Silbert and Kaye, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ibarretxe-Bilbao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Camicioli, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pyatigorskaya et al., 2014</a>).

The finding that PD targets a set of connected brain regions supports the network-spread hypothesis, although an alternate explanation is that neurons in one network could share a common vulnerability. The brain regions that make up the PD-ICA network are involved in reward and motivation, as demonstrated by the fact that they respond to the subjective value of a perceived stimulus during fMRI (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartra et al., 2013</a>). All the regions of this value network receive projections from midbrain dopamine neurons, in keeping with this neurotransmitter's role in signaling incentive value (<a href=\"#bib60\">Salamone et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Berridge, 2006</a>)."

We showed that the SN could act as a propagator, since the rate of atrophy in any brain region was proportional to its effective topological distance from the SN, as determined by either functional (rsfMRI) or anatomical (DW-MRI) connectivity. We note that, while the SN contains dopamine neurons whose degeneration accounts for all the key clinical features of early PD, the Braak scheme identifies the dorsal motor nucleus (DMN) of the vagus in the medulla as the first affected CNS structure. Indeed, recent evidence supports the potential transfer of pathogenic alpha-synuclein from the intestine to the DMN via the vagus nerve (<a href=\"#bib40\">Holmqvist et al., 2014</a>). In the current study, the DMN did not demonstrate atrophy in PD compared to control subjects. Perhaps this is due to insensitivity of T1-weighted MRI-based anatomical methods in identifying neuronal loss in lower brainstem structures. The DMN is much smaller that the SN (approximately 1/10\u20131/20 in volume) and has limited contrast in T1 MRI. Our results, however, suggest that the SN could act as the propagator of the disease to the supratentorial CNS. Note, however, that spatial resolution limitations for all of the imaging modalities used here, T1-weighted MRI, fMRI, and DW-MRI, make it difficult to localize atrophy to small nuclei with complete certainty. Spatial inaccuracy in atlas generation and normalization of subject images to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space may compound this problem. This is especially relevant to small structures of the basal forebrain and midbrain. For example, the propagator analysis identified SN, subthalamic nucleus, and red nucleus as potential propagators, but it is clear that the imaging techniques used here do not allow us to fully resolve these structures, either anatomically or functionally. Furthermore, because T1-weighted MRI is sensitive to iron content, changes in iron accumulation, for example, in SN, globus pallidus, or red nucleus, may be interpreted as volume changes by the DBM methodology."

Hubs are defined as brain regions that are highly connected using graph theoretical metrics such as degree (<a href=\"#bib24\">Crossley et al., 2014</a>) or betweenness (<a href=\"#bib39\">He et al., 2009</a>). In theory, hubs, being highly connected, should have greater exposure to a toxic agent that is spread trans-neuronally. In a recent meta-analysis, <a href=\"#bib24\">Crossley et al. (2014)</a> found that most neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and fronto-temporal dementia, did indeed target hubs. However, one salient exception was PD. One possibility is that the PD studies included in the meta-analysis were too small in scale or methodologically incapable of detecting the true extent of damage. It is intriguing that our study identified numerous hub regions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bassett et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">He et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Crossley et al., 2014</a>) in the PD-ICA network, including the medial temporal lobe, putamen, insula, occipital cortex, anterior cingulate, superior frontal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus. One notable hub region absent from our PD-ICA network is the posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus, an area typically affected in AD (<a href=\"#bib16\">Buckner et al., 2009</a>). It would be interesting to see if this area eventually develops atrophy as PD progresses, and whether this is associated with cognitive impairment."

Atrophy and dopamine denervation also both correlated with age in the control group. In sum, the control subjects demonstrated age-related loss of dopamine innervation and atrophy in the PD-ICA network. This finding is also novel. It is known that healthy aging is associated with a progressive loss of dopamine neurotransmission (<a href=\"#bib31\">Fearnley and Lees, 1991</a>), and that this may account for motor slowing and executive cognitive impairment that occurs with age (<a href=\"#bib45\">Jagust, 2013</a>). Indeed, subtle Parkinsonian signs such as stooped posture, bradykinesia, and reduced facial expression in the healthy elderly were associated with SN neuron loss at post-mortem (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ross et al., 2004</a>). Our results extend these findings by showing that neurodegeneration of the extended dopamine network also occurs in healthy aging, albeit without attaining the severity of outright PD, possibly via loss of neurotrophism, or perhaps, due to low-level mitochondrial dysfunction or synucleinopathy (<a href=\"#bib53\">Olanow and Brundin, 2013</a>). PD might then target the PD-ICA network due to a dual hit effect of pathology superimposed upon normal aging."

DBM consists in spatially transforming each MRI non-linearly to a stereotaxic template, and using the local deformation as a measure of tissue expansion or atrophy. There are other methods to detect population differences in brain structure. VBM measures local gray matter density by transforming the brain to stereotaxic space, segmenting the tissue into gray and white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, and performing spatial smoothing on the gray matter maps so that local image intensity reflects gray matter density (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashburner and Friston, 2000</a>). We decided against VBM as it does not preserve the entirety of the MRI data, and there is some suggestion that it is less sensitive than DBM to subcortical atrophy (<a href=\"#bib12\">Borghammer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Scanlon et al., 2011</a>). Another approach is to measure cortical thickness from the MRI (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pereira et al., 2014</a>), but this would also make it impossible to detect subcortical changes."

All rights Reserved) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hammers et al., 2003</a>) excluding the brainstem, cerebellum, and white matter. For the cerebellum, we used a public-domain high-resolution digital cerebellar atlas (<a href=\"#bib27\">Diedrichsen et al., 2009</a>). These two atlases do not have adequate segmentation of three midbrain structures, the SN, subthalamic nucleus, and red nucleus. We therefore manually segmented these three structures using the Display software tool (McConnell Brain Imaging Centre) and three sources of anatomical information: the high-resolution MRI template (T1-weighted ICBM 2009c template, resolution = 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup>), the BigBrain (<a href=\"#bib52\">Amunts et al., 2013</a>), a 20-micron resolution digital brain atlas in MNI space, and the brainstem anatomical atlas of <a href=\"#bib29\">Duvernoy et al. (1995)</a>. The three structures were manually drawn on the high-resolution ICBM 2009c template. We then confirmed the segmentation of these three regions with a recently developed subcortical atlas based on ultra high-field MRI (<a href=\"#bib47\">Keuken et al., 2014</a>). The composite atlas thus created contains 112 cortical and subcortical structures (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) and excludes all brainstem regions caudal to the SN."

                                "text": "We used ICA to extract patterns of deformation in PD patients and age-matched controls. ICA is a statistical method to decompose multivariate data into statistically independent components (<a href=\"#bib17\">Calhoun et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beckmann and Smith, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Hyv\u00e4rinen et al., 2004</a>). In this case, we used ICA to decompose the deformation maps into spatially distinct subcomponents. ICA was performed with MELODIC (<a href=\"http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC\">http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC</a>), a toolbox that is part of the FSL analysis package (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beckmann and Smith, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Smith et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Douaud et al., 2014</a>). All the individual DBM images (patients and controls combined) were concatenated to create a 4-D image in which the first three dimensions are the individual 3-D deformation maps and the fourth dimension consists of the subjects. MELODIC applies an initial principal component analysis-based dimension estimation to find the optimal number of independent components and then uses this number in the decomposition procedure to identify the independent spatial components. Each of these components consists of a vector of normalized DBM values (one per subject) as well as a corresponding 3-D spatial map. The spatial maps were converted to <i>z-</i>statistic images via normalized mixture-model fitting, and thresholded at <i>z</i> = 3 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beckmann and Smith, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Smith et al., 2009</a>). The ICA algorithm in MELODIC is sensitive to sparsely distributed (super-Gaussian) data (<a href=\"#bib26\">Daubechies et al., 2009</a>) as typically seen in fMRI. We confirmed that the DBM data used here possessed this super-Gaussian property (kurtosis &gt;4)."

Physiological noise was accounted for by including white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signals as covariates.

It benefits from a (multi-centric) large cohort of rare de novo PD patients and from the methodological approaches used for the analysis of local atrophy (namely DBM+ICA). The fact that the authors also looked for a spread of the disease via structural and functional networks (using both diffusion imaging and [resting-state] fMRI) is another strength of this study. It provides intriguing evidence in support of the hypothesis that atrophy initiated in or near the substantia nigra may spread to other subcortical and cortical regions in a pattern that at least to some degree reflects network connectivity as revealed by resting-state fMRI."

A relative weakness is that only one method was used to define the atrophy pattern in PD, the central finding in the paper. There are numerous techniques for detecting and quantifying atrophy, so why did the authors choose the one they did (DBS). Do they get similar results using an alternative technique? Similarly, they only used one method to identify the atrophy pattern (ICA). Why not use a seed based approach to identify regions whose atrophy correlates with atrophy in the SN? The authors do not need to perform every methodological possibility, but the reasons for their choices need to be more clearly justified. Further, they should make it clear when and why their methods deviate from prior work with similar goals (e.g. Bill Seeley's work)."

The authors convincingly show that a specific pattern of atrophy is related to PD, aging, dopamine binding in the striatum, and UPDRS score. This alone is very worthy of publication. Whether this atrophy network is an \u201cintrinsic brain network\u201d, as defined by resting state fcMRI, or validates the \u201cnetwork spread model\u201d of PD, this is indeed an important question, but it is weakly supported by the present data.

Specifically, the criteria for a \u201cmatch\u201d are arbitrary. The authors chose a threshold of r = 0.25. If they had chosen a threshold of 0.35 instead, we would conclude that the atrophy pattern fails to match any intrinsic connectivity networks. Rather than concluding that the atrophy matches or fails to match an intrinsic connectivity pattern, the authors could make better claims on comparative matching. In other words, they can claim that their atrophy pattern matches a specific network better than other atrophy patterns and they can conclude that their atrophy pattern matches a specific network better than other networks."

It can therefore be the case that some more \u201cglobal\u201d components explaining the largest variance across the subjects can be missed sometimes. It seems unlikely here as the inputs used for TICA were DBM maps and not GM maps, and the main IC is reassuringly highly relevant to the pathology studied.

First, measuring atrophy in the caudal brainstem is difficult using T1-MRI, even with DBM. Second, both rsfMRI and tractography do poorly in this region: fMRI because it is prone to respiratory and pulse artifacts, and tractography because it is difficult to trace white matter pathways to their real target (the brainstem being a dense structure with numerous small nuclei). The brainstem is also especially prone to MRI susceptibility artifacts. These issues are outlined in <a href=\"#bib32\">Ford et al., 2013</a>.

It seems unlikely here as the inputs used for TICA were DBM maps and not GM maps, and the main IC is reassuringly highly relevant to the pathology studied. It might be worth however for the authors to run FLICA (another data-driven ICA tool available in FSL) on their data to make sure results are similar</i>."

As mentioned above, GM maps and DBM maps have different data structure. GM maps from VBM having a sub-Gaussian distribution in general (due to spatial smoothing), do not possess the sparsity of fMRI data and indeed when we apply MELODIC to VBM maps from the PPMI dataset we obtain a single component (basically the entire brain). DBM data on the other hand are even sparser than fMRI and this makes MELODIC suitable for analyzing them. In order to formally check for sparsity we performed a kurtosis analysis of the PPMI DBM and VBM data as well as our fMRI dataset for comparison. In <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 5</a>, we present the distributions of kurtosis values computed for each subject."

The presence of many cerebellar regions as good propagators in the diffusion-based connectome is possibly artifactual. Cerebellar fibres pass through the pons, forming the cortico-ponto-cerebellar tract. Tractography may be poor at resolving these cortico-ponto-cerebellar connections from ascending fibres whose origin is in brainstem nuclei, and from corticospinal tract fibres, due to partial volume effects (contamination among numerous densely packed adjacent pathways) and decussation within the brainstem. Thus the brainstem and cerebellar portion of the connectome is likely to suffer from imprecise assignment of edges. This could explain the low specificity obtained for the different cerebellar regions as possible propagators (i.e. all cerebellum regions are grouped with very similar correlation values, according to the DW-MRI data). Nonetheless we now present the data and discuss potential pitfalls."
