A flagellum is made up of many proteins called flagellins, which are continuously shed and can alert the immune system to the presence of a bacterial pathogen. The flagella of some pathogens are covered by a sheath, and it has been generally assumed that the purpose of this sheath is to prevent the telltale flagellin proteins being detected by the host (<a href=\"#bib3\">Geis et al., 1993</a>). Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Edward Ruby and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and the University of Iowa\u2014including Caitlin Brennan as first author\u2014turn this story on its head and show that some microbes rely on this sheath to communicate with their host (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brennan et al., 2014</a>)."

This interaction is \u2018mutualistic\u2019 rather than adversarial because both parties benefit. The squid uses the light emitted by the bacteria to obscure its silhouette during its nocturnal wanderings of the moonlit ocean, which helps it avoid being spotted by predators. In return, the squid provides the bacteria with sugars and other nutrients. Ruby and co-workers show that the bacteria make their presence known by rotating their sheathed flagella, which results in increased shedding of a molecule called lipopolysaccharide, or LPS for short (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brennan et al., 2014</a>)."

However, the squid can detect the <i>V. fischeri</i> bacteria before they start their journey into the light organ (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Kremer et al., 2013</a>), and the host responds to these early colonizers by instructing specific cells to commit suicide via a process called apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Foster et al., 2000</a>)."

Brennan et al. hypothesized that rotating the sheathed flagellum sheds LPS, thereby producing adequate amounts of this signal to be perceived by the host (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis, they found that the mutant strains released much less LPS than wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i>. Moreover, they demonstrated that the human pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i> also releases much less LPS when their flagella cannot rotate<i>.</i> However, <i>E. coli</i>, which do not have sheathed flagella, continue to release of LPS (albeit at low levels) even if their flagella cannot rotate (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brennan et al., 2014</a>)<i>.</i>"

Brennan et al. have now redefined the function of the flagella sheath by showing that rotation of <i>V. fischeri\u2019s</i> sheathed flagella (depicted by the black arrow) induces the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, beige rectangles), and that LPS is required to trigger apoptosis and other changes in the squid to accommodate the bacteria. <i>V. fischeri</i> mutants whose flagella do not rotate (<i>motB1</i> and <i>motX</i>) release significantly less LPS and do not induce apoptosis. Many other bacteria, such as <i>E. coli,</i> have unsheathed flagella that shed flagellin monomers (black rectangles); however, both wild-type <i>E. coli</i> and mutants that cannot rotate their flagella (<i>motAB</i>) shed similar low levels of LPS."

It is interesting to speculate that concealing one molecule that stimulates the immune system, flagellin, with another, LPS, allows <i>V. fischeri</i> to manage its interaction with its host. Controlling its interaction with the host immune system is also important for the stomach pathogen <i>H. pylori,</i> which may wish to remain hidden<i>. H. pylori</i> have unusually structured LPS that trigger a muted immune response, a trait they may have evolved as a strategy for living with rotating, sheathed flagella that shed copious amounts of LPS (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ogawa et al., 1997</a>)."

                "text": "A lesson from the work of Brennan et al. is that we should avoid typecasting bacteria and the different signals that they produce. For example, a building block of peptidoglycan\u2014a component of the cell wall in bacteria\u2014is known as \u2018trachea toxin\u2019 from studies of the whooping cough pathogen. However, the same molecule serves as another potent signal to trigger tissue changes in the squid-<i>Vibrio</i> system (<a href=\"#bib5\">Koropatnick et al., 2004</a>). With the addition of the work by Brennan et al., we are reminded that the context in which the host interprets these powerful immune system-stimulating molecules likely determines the outcome of the interaction. Thus, moving forward, it will be interesting to learn the nature of the LPS structures that are shed from the sheathed flagellum, and how and why they are detected by the host to signal a desirable interaction, as opposed to an unwanted invasion."
